    "hierarchical theories of galaxy formation and evolution indicate that large systems are built up over time through the merger of smaller progenitors .",
    "galaxy interactions in the local universe motivate the `` merger hypothesis '' ( toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ) , according to which collisions between spiral galaxies produce the massive ellipticals observed at present times , a view supported by self - consistent modeling of mergers ( for reviews , see e.g.  barnes & hernquist 1992 ; barnes 1998 ) .",

    "1998 ; kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ) and that the masses of these black holes correlate with either the mass ( magorrian et al . 1998 ) or the velocity dispersion ( i.e. the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation : ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "combo-17 , and deep , there is mounting evidence that the color distribution of galaxies at @xmath4 is bimodal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the mean color and dispersion of these two ( red and blue ) distributions depend on luminosity , but little on galaxy environment @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the red galaxies in this bimodal distribution are almost all elliptical , absorption - line galaxies , at least at redshifts @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which appear to be passively evolving from a redshift of peak star formation @xmath7 , according to both fundamental plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it also appears that the properties of the red galaxies and their @xmath4 distribution , as well as their clustering and mass density evolution , are consistent with their being formed through mergers and thereafter relaxing quiescently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for mergers to produce red ellipticals from blue , star - forming disks and yield a bimodal color distribution , the color must evolve rapidly , or the observed bimodality would be washed out , requiring that star formation be terminated soon after a merger .",
    "@xcite showed that this will not occur , especially in gas rich mergers at high redshift , if black hole feedback is neglected , because even a small amount of cold gas remaining after a powerful starburst will fuel a low level of star formation for a hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , preventing the remnant from reddening sufficiently .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that feedback from black hole growth and quasar activity caused by mergers can result in a much more violent and abrupt expulsion and heating of the remaining gas , as the black hole nears its final mass .",
    "this process also produces a remnant that satisfies observed correlations between black hole and host galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "observations of elliptical galaxy ages and star formation histories motivate the notion of `` anti - hierarchical '' growth , or `` cosmic downsizing , '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the most massive spheroids are also the oldest and reddest systems . while black hole feedback is likely a key ingredient in shutting down star formation in these systems at high redshifts , allowing them to redden onto the observed @xmath4 color - magnitude relation , it does not automatically imply that particular black hole and galaxy formation scenarios are self - consistent .",
    "moreover , although there is evidence of downsizing in quasar activity , with the most luminous quasars active at @xmath8 and the peak formation redshift of quasars evolving as a function of luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has not been demonstrated that the implied downsizing is consistent or even quantitatively similar to that of the galaxy population .",
    "as we demonstrate in what follows , the relationship between downsizing in galaxy and quasar populations depends sensitively on the model chosen for quasar light curves and lifetimes in any scenario in which spheroids and quasars form together .    in our picture ,",
    "red , remnant spheroids and supermassive black holes are produced simultaneously in galaxy mergers which also yield starbursts and quasar activity .",
    "previously , we studied black hole evolution in mergers using simulations ( hopkins et al .",
    "2005a - e ) , and showed that the complex , luminosity - dependent quasar lifetimes and obscuration @xcite lead to a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity function @xcite , where the faint end of the luminosity function consists mainly of quasars growing to much larger final masses or in declining states following peak quasar activity .",
    "this implies that the distribution of quasars being created at a given redshift as a function of the quasar _ peak _ luminosity or _",
    "final _ black hole mass is _ peaked _ at a luminosity ( mass ) corresponding to the observed _ break _ in the luminosity function , falling off towards brighter and fainter luminosities .",
    "this differs from all previous models of quasar lifetimes , which predict that this distribution should have essentially identical shape to the observed luminosity function , increasing monotonically with decreasing luminosity ( black hole mass ) .",
    "because our simulations also yield observed correlations between black hole and remnant host galaxy properties , we can deduce the distribution and evolution of the remnant red galaxies produced in these merger events .",
    "these predictions will necessarily differ than those based on idealized models of quasar lifetimes , which yield a qualitatively different distribution of black hole masses ( and thus host galaxy masses and velocity distributions ) being formed at any given redshift .    here , we use our models of quasar lifetimes and lightcurves and the observed quasar luminosity function to determine the rate at which quasars with a given peak luminosity or final black hole mass are born in mergers . using the scaling relations between black hole and host galaxy properties derived from these simulations , we determine the birthrate of remnants with given properties as a function of redshift , and use this to predict the properties and evolution of the red , elliptical population in various wavebands . in ",

    "in addition , the accretion rate at any time can be variable over small timescales @xmath30 , but despite these complexities , the statistical nature of the light curve can be described by simple forms , which we describe below .    from the simulations , we find that the differential quasar lifetime , i.e.  the time spent by a quasar in a merger in a given logarithmic luminosity interval , is well fitted by an exponential , @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is proportional to the _ peak _ quasar luminosity ( @xmath33 ; roughly , the eddington luminosity of the final black hole mass ) , and @xmath34 is weakly dependent on peak luminosity .",

    "follows naturally as the break in the quasar luminosity function moves to lower luminosities at lower redshifts , and the implied downsizing is indeed quantitatively more dramatic than that implied by idealized models of quasar activity ( see   [ sec : ml ] and figure 23 of hopkins et al .",
    "2005e ) .",
    "it is important to note that the slope of the faint ( low-@xmath56 ) end of @xmath51 is only weakly constrained by the observed luminosity function , a point discussed further in   [ sec : lf.b ] . to illustrate this",

    "is also shown ( dotted line ) for comparison ( the @xmath51 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 distributions for such a model will have the same shape as the @xmath35 distribution , as explained below in   [ sec : scaling ] ) .",
    "the two models make very different predictions for luminosities / masses below those corresponding to the break in the observed luminosity function .",
    "although we do not consider the brief active quasar and starburst phases in our subsequent analysis ( as they are heavily affected by rapidly evolving star formation , dust obscuration , merger dynamics , and quasar luminosities ) , we note that our modeling allows us to predict the behavior of the active quasar host galaxy luminosity function .",
    "we expect that the active quasars at a given redshift should have a narrow range in peak luminosities ( black hole masses ) , corresponding to a narrow range in host galaxy stellar masses .",
    "this is shown in the @xmath35 and @xmath58 ( derived below ) distributions given in figure  [ fig : show.lf ] .",
    "we therefore expect that the host galaxies of quasars active at a given time will have a much narrower range in luminosities than that predicted by e.g.  idealized models of the quasar lifetime ( for which @xmath35 and therefore @xmath58 must increase monotonically with decreasing luminosity / mass ; see e.g. lidz et al .",
    "there is observational support for this : the quasar host galaxy luminosity function is found to follow an approximately lognormal distribution with narrow width @xmath59 ( @xmath60 magnitudes ) and a peak roughly corresponding to the stellar mass of quasar hosts with @xmath61 the quasar luminosity function break luminosity @xcite .      self - regulated black hole growth in our simulations yields a black hole mass - bulge velocity dispersion ( @xmath62 ) relation @xcite which agrees well with the observations of , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "it is also important to note that the evolution seen in these simulations produces a @xmath4 scatter consistent with what is observed , which is not the case for all theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the weak evolution in the @xmath62 relation is caused by an increasing @xmath3 for a given stellar mass with increasing redshift , as halos at higher redshift are more compact ; the relation between black hole mass and total stellar mass ( @xmath65 ) is independent of redshift .",

    "the scatter about this relation from the simulations is small , about @xmath64dex , similar to that observed .",
    "we note that there are considerable observational contradictions regarding possible evolution in the @xmath0 or @xmath75 relations , with e.g.  @xcite and @xcite finding no evolution to @xmath76 and e.g.  @xcite and @xcite finding substantial evolution at @xmath77 ( specifically , substantially undermassive bulges at @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , these observations are still difficult and have large uncertainties ; furthermore , they specifically select primarily active , high eddington ratio objects , which local observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest may be biased to lie above the @xmath0 relation in the manner observed . above @xmath8 , the possibility for such evolution , and the uncertainty resulting from it ,",
    "is essentially captured in our consideration of pure luminosity vs.  pure density evolution for the quasar luminosity function , since these different evolutions imply a different peak luminosity ( i.e.  final spheroid mass ) distribution .",
    "thus , the uncertainties introduced by such evolution are not significantly larger than those we already describe , unless there is large evolution at @xmath78 .",

    "we find little difference in our results between these two cases .",
    "a scaling of metallicity with mass or velocity dispersion @xmath3 could also influence our predicted luminosity functions .",
    "there is some observational evidence of a correlation between metallicity and @xmath3 , but the inferred metallicities are degenerate with the modeled population ages @xcite and some studies infer no connection between metallicity and either velocity dispersion or age or find that the observed scaling of mg and h@xmath100 line profiles is consistent with more massive ellipticals having formed earlier .",
    "moreover , the analysis of the joint correlation of metallicity with age and velocity dispersion of @xcite indicates that the relation between typical age and @xmath3 implies very little net change in metallicity in observed populations .",
    "also , it is the mg@xmath101 and h@xmath100 line indices which are well - correlated with velocity dispersion @xcite ; the @xmath102 index shows only weak correlation with velocity dispersion @xcite and so it is not clear whether this is a result of an enhancement of @xmath103 elements or depressed fe , and therefore it is difficult to translate to metallicity .",
    "regardless of these uncertainties , the effect is considerably smaller than that of changing mean spheroid ages with mass ( as demonstrated in ",

    "because these effects are weak compared to the age effects in the stellar populations we model , we do not impose a scaling of metallicity with mass or velocity dispersion , deferring a treatment of the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies to future work ( but see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , but note that its addition does not create any conflict between our predictions and observations",
    ". however , these relatively small scalings could be important for the observed colors , so we do briefly consider the possible effects of changing metallicity with @xmath3 in   [ sec : colors ] , where we show that the effect is small .",
    "we do not include the effects of dust reddening on the galaxy population , as our simulations show a dramatic and rapid falloff in characteristic column densities after the starburst , when the black hole expels surrounding gas as it reaches its final mass .",
    "this is consistent also with observations that show that only a small fraction @xmath110 of the luminosity in red galaxies can come from dusty , intrinsically bluer sources @xcite .",
    "in   [ sec : sims ] and   [ sec : scaling ] we have determined @xmath51 , the rate at which quasars of a given final black hole mass are formed in mergers , and fit this to an analytical form . having also determined the @xmath62 relation as a function of redshift and its intrinsic dispersion from our simulations , we can then convert @xmath51 to @xmath95 , the birthrate of spheroids of a given velocity dispersion as a function of redshift . to do so",

    "the contribution from spheroids in s0 and spiral galaxies , determined by @xcite , is added to this and shown also at the low-@xmath3 end where it dominates ( @xmath114 range shown as orange shaded region ) .",
    "we caution that our prediction at low-@xmath3 is somewhat sensitive to the assumed faint - end slope in the birthrate of black holes of a given mass [ @xmath51 ] , as these are not necessarily the products of major mergers .",
    "our estimate is on the high side at the extreme large-@xmath3 tail of the distribution , but this is where both the observations are uncertain and our modeling of the quasar luminosity function and corresponding black hole mass [ @xmath51 ] distribution are sensitive to the functional form and bolometric corrections adopted .",
    "we can also predict the velocity dispersion function at different redshifts based on our modeling , and these results are shown in figure  [ fig : sigma.dist ] .",
    "we note that we have adopted the pure - peak luminosity evolution ( pple ) form for the evolution of the quasar luminosity function above @xmath8 , where the break and faint - end slope of the luminosity function are poorly constrained .",

    "we can perform an identical procedure , using instead the relations between black hole mass and host galaxy stellar mass to obtain the relic stellar mass function and its evolution with redshift .",

    "the agreement is good over the entire range of observed masses , especially considering the systematic uncertainties in the observations .",
    "as is demonstrated for the galaxy luminosity function in figure  [ fig : lf.b ] , adopting an idealized `` light - bulb '' or pure exponential light curve model for the quasar lifetime will not produce the turnover and shallow slope of the faint end of this mass function , and will overpredict the low - mass end by @xmath117 orders of magnitude .",
    "the upper right of the figure shows the mass function at various redshifts , the lower left shows the integrated stellar mass density as a function of redshift , and the lower right the star formation rate .",
    "the evolution of the star formation rate qualitatively agrees well with that estimated by , e.g.@xcite , but we do not account for the star - forming spiral population which constitutes a significant or even dominant fraction of the integrated star formation rate , and so our present results are not necessarily in conflict with cosmological simulations indicating that the total mean density of cosmic star formation peaks at @xmath118 ( see , e.g. springel & hernquist 2003b ; hernquist & springel 2003 ; nagamine et al .",
    ".    subsequent gas - poor ( `` dry '' ) mergers , by definition , do not have a reservoir of cold gas , and as a result can not excite bright quasar activity .",
    "therefore , the empirical information we derive on the rate at which spheroids are born as a function of mass and redshift from the quasar luminosity function does not account for dry merging .",
    "however , we can estimate the potential impact of spheroid - spheroid mergers on our predictions .",
    "recent observations @xcite suggest that @xmath4 spheroids have , on average , undergone @xmath119 major dry mergers since @xmath120 ( see also carlberg et al .",

    "observations and our predictions for the birth redshifts of spheroids ( see   [ sec : ages ] ) imply that there should not be significant dry merging much earlier , as most spheroids are either recently formed or still forming at higher redshifts . therefore , we can estimate the effects of dry merging by assuming that each spheroid has undergone @xmath122 major dry mergers in its history down to @xmath4 . for simplicity , we assume these are equal - mass dry mergers ; i.e.  for a given interval in mass , we assume half the number of predicted spheroids dry merge , halving their number density but doubling their mass .",
    "the resulting mass function is shown by the red dot - dashed line in the upper left of figure  [ fig : mf ] ( for the pure peak luminosity evolution case ) . the net resulting change , as dry merging increases spheroid masses but decreases the total number of spheroids , is generally smaller than typical uncertainties in our modeling ( of , e.g.  the functional form of @xmath51 ) and the observations , and thus we can safely ignore the impact of dry merging in our subsequent analysis .",
    "this is also suggested by calculation of e.g.  the spheroid luminosity function from semi - analytical models @xcite .",
    "the effect is not completely negligible , however , and we note that the dry - merging corrected mass function agrees very well with the observations ( within @xmath123 at all masses ) . because dry mergers are not constrained by our empirical approach ( unlike gas - rich mergers which produce a signal in the quasar luminosity function ) , and the rate and impact of dry galaxy mergers is observationally uncertain , we do not include their effects in any of our other predictions , but emphasize here that they introduce a relatively small second - order effect which does not result in any conflict with the observations .",
    "unlike the relic velocity dispersion function , which is determined by the integrated history of spheroids , the evolution of stellar luminosities and colors makes the galaxy luminosity function in different wavebands dependent on the time history of spheroid formation .",

    "this model overpredicts the number of red / elliptical galaxies which should be observed at low luminosities by two orders of magnitude , does not reproduce the shape and curvature of the luminosity function , and underpredicts the bright end if the lifetime is chosen to be longer ( e.g.  the actual salpeter time ) .",
    "the quasar lifetime in these models is a free parameter , but it determines only the normalization of this curve , and thus no value can produce a reasonable prediction for the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the reason for the failure of these models at low luminosity is , as mentioned above , the fact that they associate objects observed at low luminosities with low-@xmath33 objects , and therefore low-@xmath56 objects in small - mass spheroids .    figure  [ fig : lf.b ] also shows our prediction ( dot - dashed lines ) , for the mean redshift of each bin , assuming pure density evolution ( pde ) instead of pure peak luminosity evolution ( pple ) for the birthrate of quasars with a given peak luminosity above @xmath8 .",
    "although the observed quasar luminosity function does not provide a good constraint on which evolution is followed , the difference in our subsequent calculations is usually minimal , and observations of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function at moderate and high redshifts ( where the two predictions begin to diverge ) do not yet exist .",
    "however , if such observations of the galaxy population can be made , or the ages of the lowest - mass / luminosity objects at @xmath137 are measured , they can provide a powerful constraint on the @xmath35 [ @xmath51 , @xmath58 ] distributions ( i.e.  the rates at which spheroids and quasars of given properties form with redshift ) .",

    "the agreement at @xmath155 is significantly improved , suggesting that the strong increase in red galaxies from @xmath54 to present is driven in part by continued formation and mergers associated with ongoing ( though declining ) quasar activity , and in part by the reddening of spheroids formed in mergers at the peak of quasar activity @xmath156 , reddening to the point where they will be recognized as red ellipticals by @xmath137 .    because , in our picture , spheroids and quasars form together through mergers , the quantities @xmath139 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are directly related to the quasar luminosity function .",
    "associating each merger with a single quasar and spheroid , the total number of red galaxies is given by the integrated number of quasars produced up to the observed redshift ; i.e.@xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the number density of quasars born per unit time per unit comoving volume . in our determination of the luminosity function , this is @xmath159constant , the normalization of the lognormal @xmath51 distribution .",

    "currently , the observations are insufficient to decide which possibility is correct , but this makes it clear that estimating the total number of red galaxies at high redshift in future observations can constrain the form of the quasar luminosity function evolution .",
    "likewise , @xmath140 is directly related to the break in the observed _ quasar _ luminosity function , which in turn corresponds directly to the peak in the @xmath35 [ and corresponding @xmath51 ] distribution @xcite , and thus gives the peak in the rate at which spheroids of a given stellar mass are forming as a function of that stellar mass . because luminosities evolve with the age of the stellar population , this is not trivially related to the @xmath140 of the galaxy population as @xmath144 is to the number density of quasars being formed , but the two are still critically related and , in general , increasing @xmath140 corresponds to moving the break in the observed quasar luminosity function to higher luminosities , and vice versa .",

    "there is some evidence for this , as , e.g. , @xcite find a @xmath187 change in the slope of the @xmath177 vs.  @xmath178 relation from @xmath188 to @xmath183 , consistent with our predictions .",
    "still , although the observations do not strongly distinguish between the pple and pde cases at this point , the weaker slope evolution seen in the pde case is somewhat more consistent with the observations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who find results consistent with no evolution in the @xmath179 vs.  @xmath178 slope at redshifts @xmath189 , and at most a similar @xmath190 change over this redshift range .",
    "however , we caution that these samples are selected either by color ( in which case they are obviously biased against a strong blueing of the high - mass population ) or by morphology .",
    "if a considerable fraction of the most massive galaxies are still forming ( i.e. have recently merged or begun merging ) , they will not have relaxed and will not be identified by either criterion .",
    "therefore , we consider the color - magnitude relation derived if we ignore all objects at any redshift which have formed less than 1 gyr in the past ( about the time it takes for significant morphological and color disturbances from the merger to relax ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : color.mag.old ] shows our predictions with this caveat ( in the manner of figure  [ fig : color.mag ] , also assuming pure density evolution above @xmath8 ) , for @xmath189 , as at higher redshifts this cut excludes all but the objects formed at the highest , most uncertain redshifts . as is clear in the figure , this further reduces the evolution in the slope , with the change in slope over this redshift range in each color magnitude relation essentially consistent with zero .",
    "we do not explicitly model populations of `` old '' pre - merger stars ( although these are included in our simulations ) , which should form in the progenitor disks before the merger .",
    "although at times long after the merger this should not be a significant contributor to the galaxy colors , as much of the stellar population is formed in a strong starburst , the effect could be significant for massive galaxies which have recently formed , reddening these objects and reducing ( or even reversing ) the slope evolution shown .",
    "regardless , this slope change is difficult to observe , even in the absence of the strong limits to measured magnitudes and colors imposed from observations at higher redshift , as some of these objects become blue or morphologically disturbed enough that they will not be classified as red / elliptical galaxies .",
    "this explains our slight overprediction of the very bright end of the galaxy luminosity function at redshifts @xmath191 in   [ sec : lf.b ] and   [ sec : lf.b.evol ] , as these galaxies correspond to the rapidly blueing galaxies in these color - magnitude relations and will not appear in the observed red galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "as noted above , we also do not include the effects of dust reddening , which can become important for recently - formed galaxies in which star formation has not yet terminated ( i.e.  massive galaxies at high redshift ) , as our modeling in @xcite and observations of the high - redshift massive red galaxy populations @xcite indicate , and will most likely also reduce or even reverse the plotted evolution in slope .",
    "however , we do not expect this to have a strong effect on the typical mean colors at a given redshift , except perhaps for the very highest redshifts where most galaxies may still be actively merging .    despite these caveats ,",
    "we can make two further predictions from our modeling .",
    "first , the observed bimodality in the distribution of galaxy colors should break down at large redshift , especially at high luminosities , as the bright - end merger remnants become bluer . specifically , we predict , in the absence of strong evolution in the blue color population , that the two color distributions should coalesce around @xmath192 , as is observed by , e.g. , willmer et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and giallongo et al .",
    "second , the fraction of red galaxies ( classified on the basis of the @xmath137 bimodal color distribution ) , which dominate the bright end of the luminosity function at low redshift , should decrease at higher redshift ( i.e.the bright end of the luminosity function should have an increasing contribution from `` blue '' galaxies , in reality the same as the red elliptical remnants observed at @xmath137 but formed more recently and thus bluer ) , as observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these authors find a fraction as large as @xmath193 of these galaxies show irregular morphologies providing evidence for merger - driven interactions by @xmath194 , as we expect based on their formation redshifts ( see also figures  [ fig : ages ] and [ fig : frac.young ] below ) .",
    "this also explains the observations of @xcite in the far uv ( @xmath195 ) from galex and @xcite in hst morphological surveys , who find that the density of unobscured starburst or peculiar merging galaxies increases dramatically from @xmath4 to @xmath54 , where they begin to dominate the bright end of the cumulative ( spiral and elliptical ) luminosity function , as anticipated from the color - magnitude evolution of figure  [ fig : color.mag ] and the excess of bright blue ( recently forming ) galaxies beginning to appear at this redshift in figure  [ fig : lf.b ] .",
    "this is also expected from our modeling of the co - production of quasars and spheroids , as numerous observations have found that the host galaxies of quasars at high redshift ( which should relax to become normal present ellipticals ) are excessively blue , both from agn contributions and recent starburst activity .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that dusty blue galaxies which are still forming stars constitute a large fraction ( @xmath196 ) of the high - mass red galaxy population at @xmath197 , while older `` dead '' red spheroids constitute a smaller fraction @xmath187 , with ages implying formation redshifts @xmath198 ( accounting for a rapid quenching of star formation instead of ongoing star formation , see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , the pple case assumes that the distribution of formation rates shifts to lower luminosities above @xmath8 rather than uniformly decreasing , implying that before @xmath8 , most of the lowest mass objects were formed earliest while larger objects only just formed , with this trend reversing subsequently . because most spheroid and quasar production occurs after @xmath46 ,",
    "this is sufficient to reproduce the observed @xmath4 relations , but results in the stronger slope evolution , even a reversal in sign in the color - magnitude relation slope at high redshifts .",

    "the exact value of the quasar lifetime we chose is unimportant , as it sets only the normalization of the number of spheroids produced , not their magnitudes or color distribution .",
    "it is clear that such a model does not accurately reproduce the @xmath4 color - magnitude relation , even at moderate spheroid masses @xmath206 .",
    "this is because such modeling does not incorporate strong enough ` cosmic down - sizing ' ; i.e.  a sufficiently strong age gradient with spheroid mass , even allowing for a quasar luminosity function with strong `` luminosity - dependent density evolution '' as e.g.  the ueda et al.(2003 ) luminosity function adopted here .",
    "the lower right panel shows our predicted color - magnitude diagram neglecting black hole feedback in galaxy mergers .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , mergers without black hole feedback result in much weaker heating of the gas in the galaxy , so that star formation continues , declining in a roughly exponential manner over a hubble time , as found in simulations without black holes by e.g.@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can approximate the prediction in a model neglecting black hole feedback by allowing for an exponentially declining star formation rate after a peak corresponding to the phase of quasar activity .",
    "we assume the timescale for exponential decay is @xmath207gyr , similar to that estimated in simulations neglecting black hole feedback , and demand that the stellar mass after multiple @xmath135-foldings is that given by e.g.  our @xmath65 relation ( although this choice only weakly effects our results , so long as the @xmath65 relation holds at least approximately after @xmath207 or more @xmath135-foldings in the star formation rate ) .",
    "the primary result of this is indicated in the lower right panel of the figure , namely that the galaxies are much too blue ( by @xmath207 magnitude ) , and do not develop the characteristic slope of the color - magnitude relation .",
    "this demonstrates the dramatic importance of black hole feedback , as the rapid quenching of star formation both allows remnants to redden sufficiently and enables the gradient in formation age with mass to produce a slope in the color - magnitude relation , as opposed to its being `` washed - out '' by continued star formation in hosts of all masses , regardless of the peak in their star formation histories .",

    "both the @xmath4 mean colors and their evolution at low redshift are reproduced by our modeling , but this is not trivial even given the @xmath211 relation and fundamental plane , as for example the scatter in color is not equivalent as a function of luminosity or velocity dispersion .",

    "the weak variation in these colors with velocity dispersion , however , means that the small effects of a systematic dependence of total metallicity on velocity dispersion or age may be important .",
    "we show the consequences of such a dependence in figure  [ fig : color.sigma.metal ] , where we repeat the modeling of figure  [ fig : color.sigma ] , but adopt a scaling of metallicity with age ( here we mean @xmath4 age , i.e.  formation redshift ) and velocity dispersion . to estimate the maximum effect",

    "we choose this scaling as opposed to others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the resulting color - magnitude relations are steepened , and their slopes agree well with the observations .",
    "the colors change by a negligible amount at the approximate zero - point of the observations at @xmath213 , because here the offset of the color - magnitude relation is determined by the ages of the spheroid populations alone , and agrees well as in figure  [ fig : color.sigma ] .",
    "also , although the agreement in slope appears improved , we note that the effect is still small , generally @xmath214mag in a given color even at the extreme values of @xmath215 plotted ( except for the high-@xmath3 end of the @xmath180 colors , which are discussed above in greater detail ) .    this is an approximate upper limit , for example the other determinations within @xcite yield smaller logarithmic slopes of metallicity with @xmath3 , e.g.  @xmath216 as opposed to the @xmath217 shown . that this is a still small effect and further that it serves to bring our predictions into better agreement with observations , suggests that we are safe in neglecting it in other predictions",
    ". however , with improved observations of the color-@xmath3 variation , the distinctions between the predictions in e.g.  figure  [ fig : color.sigma ] and figure  [ fig : color.sigma.metal ] could be significant enough to constrain the strength of the metallicity evolution allowed or required .",
    "we find that the scatter in colors at a given @xmath3 is typically smaller than that at a given magnitude .",
    "in   [ sec : ages ] below , we demonstrate that this is a consequence of the fact that velocity dispersion is directly related to the black hole masses forming over cosmic time , whereas the @xmath4 magnitude mixes systems of different masses and ages ( and thus different colors ) at the same observed luminosity .",
    "observationally , @xcite also find that these correlations have small scatter , similar to our predictions , and argue that they are tighter and may represent a more fundamental correlation than , e.g.  the color - magnitude relations .",
    "we also note that the qualitative behavior of colors as a function of velocity dispersion and redshift is similar for each of the colors considered , although different colors are rescaled about different values , and the evolution in the slope of the color-@xmath3 relation is much weaker than that of the color - magnitude relation .",
    "these properties make the color - velocity dispersion relation a valuable probe not just as a check on the color - magnitude relation but potentially as a measurement independent of some systematics ( for example , the common observational assumption of constant slope with redshift in this case appears quite reliable ) .",
    "finally , we use our modeling to generate an observed color - magnitude relation in figure  [ fig : mock.color.mag ] . at each redshift",
    "considered , we calculate the joint probability distribution in both color and magnitude based on our predicted history of spheroid formation prior to that redshift ( i.e.  the color distribution at a given magnitude in figure  [ fig : color.mag ] , and distribution in magnitudes from our predicted luminosity functions in e.g.figure  [ fig : lf.b ] ) , and generate 1000 points ( mock galaxies ) according to that probability distribution .",

    "we show galaxies older than 0.5gyr as black points , and galaxies younger than this as red points .",
    "this demonstrates that very young galaxies are not a significant contributor to the observed red galaxy population at low redshift , and thus the fact that they lie in a more blue , brighter region of color - magnitude space than the `` normal '' relaxed elliptical population , as well as most likely being disturbed systems which would not be morphologically recognized as ellipticals , is not important in our calculations at low redshift .",
    "the removal of these points at @xmath4 does not change our results significantly , except to slightly steepen the fitted color - magnitude slope to @xmath220 , in better agreement with that observed .    at @xmath221 and @xmath185 ,",

    "many of these predicted quantities , including the colors , mass - to - light ratios , and luminosity - size relations of spheroids , are essentially probes of the distribution of ages as a function of spheroid mass .",
    "however , this does not mean that they are trivially related , as they manifest a different dependence on subsequent star formation , structural galaxy scalings ( e.g.  @xmath265 or @xmath92 relations ) , and dispersion in age as a function of different variables ( as for example we have shown that the dispersion in colors and ages is different as a function of luminosity , mass , and velocity dispersion ) .",
    "furthermore , if effects such as dry merging or metallicity scaling with stellar mass were not , as we have demonstrated , second order effects , they would break the implicit self - consistency of these quantities .",
    "most important , different samples which probe e.g.  different mass ranges , environments , sample sizes , and redshifts ( and , correspondingly , have different systematic effects and biases ) measure different quantities and constrain age distributions by these different methods , and therefore it is important to compare to the complete range of such observations rather than one particular choice .",
    "our results tie together the observed red , elliptical galaxy population and the quasar and relic supermassive black hole populations . with our modeling of quasar and merger activity derived from hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", we have shown that the diverse set of _ galaxy _ observations listed above can be predicted directly from the observed _ quasar _ luminosity function .",
    "we have demonstrated that the quasar luminosity function implies the properties of the red galaxy population and their evolution with redshift , providing compelling evidence that spheroid and quasar formation must be driven by the same process of galaxy merging .",
    "our methodology depends only on the form of the quasar lifetime as a function of peak luminosity , and simple scaling relations between black hole and galaxy properties such as the @xmath0 relation .",
    "our simulations reproduce these scalings , independent of a wide range of host galaxy properties including gas fractions , presence or absence of bulges , initial black hole masses , ism gas equation of state , galaxy orbital parameters , and virial velocities .",
    "for example , we have varied the mass ratio of the merging galaxies and find that these scalings are unchanged between simulations with mass ratios of 1:1 , 2:1 , 3:1 , and 5:1 .",
    "we demonstrate in @xcite that the scaling of quasar lifetime with luminosity and peak luminosity can be understood as a consequence of black hole self - regulation .",
    "thus , as long as black holes still self - regulate in a manner which preserves observed relations , we expect these scalings to be robust with respect to mass ratios and the merger parameters listed above .",
    "the independence of these scalings , expressed in this manner , has the advantage that it allows us to relate and predict the properties of the quasar , black hole , and spheroid populations independent of a complete cosmological framework .",
    "our approach thus allows us to determine , without introducing tunable parameters or additional uncertainty regarding detailed cosmological distributions , whether the merger hypothesis and the joint formation of spheroids and supermassive black holes in a quasar phase in major mergers are simultaneously consistent with quasar and spheroid observations .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to constrain the underlying cosmological rate of creation or formation of spheroids and quasars in major mergers as a function of e.g.  quasar peak luminosity or spheroid mass .",
    "these constraints appear to be consistent with observational estimates of merging galaxy luminosity functions ( hopkins et al.2005 g , in preparation ) , as these have a well - defined peak and turnover corresponding to that predicted in e.g.  our @xmath58 distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our detailed results for individual galaxy mergers and constraints on the formation rates of spheroids can be combined with and used to test cosmological models , but we caution against too direct a comparison of predicted merger rates with the constraints from our modeling , at least presently . the mergers which produce quasars and spheroids , and are therefore of interest to and constrained by our modeling , are mergers not just of halos , but halos that host galaxies , and where the galaxies themselves have comparable masses and large reservoirs of cold gas , and will themselves merge in a hubble time .",
    "there are certainly sufficient halo - halo major mergers in the standard cdm cosmology to explain the galaxy merger rates we infer ; for example , the calculations of e.g.  @xcite show that there are more than enough major mergers at all masses to account for observed quasars with a one - to - one correspondence between quasars and ongoing halo mergers , even with a short quasar lifetime @xmath266yr ( much shorter than the quasar lifetime we calculate for luminosities below the break in the observed luminosity function ) . however , cosmological simulations do not yet have the resolution to determine the rates and properties of such mergers , let alone the gas physics of star formation and black hole accretion and feedback .",
    "semi - analytical models do not calculate the physics of these processes in a self - consistent manner , and must adopt a number of assumptions about merger properties which introduce considerable uncertainty ( and allow considerable fine - tuning ) in the predictions of the rates and effects of such mergers . still ,",
    "ideally , our results can be combined with such approaches in a manner which greatly increases their effective dynamic range , eventually enabling an a priori prediction of the relevant merger rates and quasar and spheroid properties from a fully theoretical framework .",
    "the merger hypothesis presented by toomre ( 1977 ) met with a great deal of skepticism , much of which persists nearly 30 years later .",
    "however , many of the objections to toomre s proposal owe to an inappropriate comparison between the properties of interacting galaxies seen _ locally _ , and those of large ellipticals which , in our model , formed when the universe was only a small fraction of its present age .",
    "for example , ostriker ( 1980 ) argued that ellipticals could not form in the manner suggested by toomre because ellipticals are more concentrated than disks of local spirals .",
    "this viewpoint can be expressed most neatly in terms of phase space densities : ellipticals have higher central phase space densities than disks of local spirals and because , according to liouville s theorem , phase space density is conserved during a collisionless process , mergers between disks can not explain the high phase space density of ellipticals ( carlberg 1986 , gunn 1987 ) .",
    "n - body simulations show that this is indeed the case ( e.g.  barnes 1988 , 1992 ; hernquist 1992 , 1993a ) , but this argument is flawed when applied to the merger hypothesis in at least two ways .",
    "first , disks at high redshifts were likely more compact than their counterparts in the local universe .",
    "second , and perhaps more important , disks at @xmath267 were almost certainly more gas - rich than those of local spirals . as emphasized by e.g.lake ( 1989 ) , liouville s theorem does not apply to mergers involving gas - rich galaxies because gas can radiate energy .    previous efforts to include gas dissipation in galaxy mergers , such as those of , e.g. , hernquist ( 1989 ) ,",
    "barnes & hernquist ( 1991 , 1996 ) and mihos & hernquist ( 1996 ) were restricted to cases where the progenitor galaxies were @xmath268 gas because the ism was modeled as a single - phase , isothermal medium .",
    "however , based on simulations and simple physical arguments , hernquist et al .",
    "( 1993 ) estimated that remnants of disk mergers would have a sufficiently high phase space density to explain central properties of ellipticals only for progenitor gas fractions @xmath269 .",
    "more complex , more realistic treatments of the ism as a multiphase medium ( e.g. springel & hernquist 2003a ) now make it possible to construct disks with much larger gas fractions that do not violate the toomre ( 1964 ) stability criterion ( see , e.g. , fig . 6 of springel et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "the simulations used in the present study , which employ galaxies with larger gas fractions than in earlier works and with galaxy structure reflecting cosmic evolution , show that mergers can , in fact , account for observed properties of ellipticals .",
    "furthermore , by incorporating black hole growth and feedback into the simulations , we have demonstrated that the various processes attending a gas - rich merger can explain a much broader class of phenomena than toomre s ( 1977 ) original hypothesis . indeed , it is a remarkable fact that the critical gas fraction suggested by hernquist et al .",
    "( 1993 ) to overcome the phase space density problem is similar to that required for mergers to produce agn with luminosities matching those of bright quasars at @xmath270 as well as reproducing observed kinematic and structural properties of ellipticals that have been puzzling up to now .",
    "for example , as we show in cox et al .",
    "( 2005b , in preparation ) , the observed distribution of projected misalignments between spin and minor axes of ellipticals is naturally reproduced by our models if the gas fraction is large enough , which is not true for mergers between gas - poor spirals .",
    "these gas fractions are appropriate for the redshifts of formation we have determined here , with most large ellipticals building up their mass at moderate to high redshifts @xmath7 , and subsequent mergers primarily `` dry '' or collisionless .",

    "however , as @xcite and this work make clear , these models must incorporate feedback from agn activity ( as in , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the corresponding very rapid expulsion of gas and quenching of star formation in mergers to explain the formation of red spheroids at much later times @xmath192 , as the bulk of observations suggest ( see   [ sec : ages ] ) , as well as the significant faint population of such objects and their field population , as most observations find very little dependence on environment in the red galaxy population at fixed mass or luminosity @xcite .",
    "feedback from starburst - driven winds and agn may also be critical in suppressing excessive early formation of low - mass spheroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to explain the anti - hierarchical growth of spheroid and black hole mass implied by the quasar luminosity function .",
    "a proper accounting of the luminosity dependence of the quasar lifetime shows that the anti - hierarchical `` downsizing '' seen in both spheroid and quasar evolution is completely self - consistent , which is _ not _ the case if this dependence is ignored .",
    "also , unlike these and other previous galaxy evolution models , we are able to specifically predict the properties of the red / spheroid population , and do so without the addition of new tunable parameters . the input physics of our simulations and modeling is already strongly constrained by an extensive range of observations of quasar properties ( di matteo et al .",

    "previous attempts to infer the properties of the spheroid population from the quasar luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although providing strong evidence of general co - evolution , have been forced to invoke evolution in e.g.  the @xmath65 relation to explain integrated properties of the spheroid population and could not predict e.g.  spheroid luminosity functions , whereas the application of more realistic quasar lifetimes immediately resolves these difficulties .",
    "any modeling which attempts to simultaneously reproduce the properties of quasars and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , specifically the remnant spheroid population , with agn activity triggered in interactions and mergers must account for the effects of feedback and gas physics on quasar evolution , and in particular must account for the non - trivial , luminosity - dependent nature of the quasar lifetime .",
    "we provide a large number of new predictions of the evolution of red galaxy properties with redshift , for comparison with future observations , which can be used to test this model and refine our understanding of joint spheroid and agn formation .",
    "our modeling also motivates observations of e.g.  the ages , mass - to - light ratios , and colors of low - mass / luminosity galaxies at @xmath189 to strongly constrain whether pure luminosity or pure density evolution occurs in the quasar / spheroid population at high redshift , where direct observations are inaccessible .",
    "these observations can also constrain the shape of the faint - end peak luminosity distribution , i.e.  the low mass slope of the rate at which quasars of a given final black hole mass form ( directly related to the remnant spheroid properties ) , where observations of e.g.  the quasar luminosity function provide only very weak constraints @xcite .",

    "<S> the quasar dies when there is no longer a significant supply of gas to power accretion , and the stellar remnant relaxes as a passively evolving spheroid satisfying the @xmath0 relation and lying on the fundamental plane . the same process that halts black hole growth also terminates star formation in the remnant , accounting for the observed red galaxy population in the bimodal color / morphology distribution of galaxies . using a model for quasar lifetimes and evolution motivated by hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers , we de </S>",

    "<S> identifying quasar activity with the formation of spheroids in the framework of the merger hypothesis , this enables us to infer the corresponding birthrate of spheroids with given properties as a function of redshift . with this method , we predict , for the red galaxy population , the distribution of galaxy velocity dispersions , the galaxy mass function , mass density , and star formation rates , the luminosity function in many observed wavebands ( e.g. , nuv , u , b , v , r , r , i , j , h , k ) , the total number density and luminosity density of red galaxies , the distribution of colors as a function of magnitude and velocity dispersion for several different wavebands , the distribution of mass to light ratios as a function of mass , the luminosity - size relations , and the typical ages and distribution of ages ( formation redshifts ) as a function of both mass and luminosity . for each </S>",
