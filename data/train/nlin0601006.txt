    "we consider here explicit solutions for ballistic aggregation of dust - like matter , with particles that stick upon collisions absolutely inelastically . this system may be considered as a model for the large structure formation in the universe within the zeldovich approximation  @xcite .",
    "first we briefly recall how this model comes about .",
    "consider a flat einstein ",
    "de sitter universe containing massive dust - like matter that moves in a self - consistent gravitational field .",
    "this matter participates in two types of motion , the homogeneous cosmological hubble expansion and the evolution of local perturbations of density and velocity , which leads to formation of large - scale inhomogeneities .    to describe the latter kind of dynamics in coordinates comoving with the hubble expansion , ya .",
    "b.  zeldovich proposed  @xcite to use a nonlinear function of time , the perturbation growth factor , instead of the cosmological time . in the new time , the gravitational force turns out to be approximately balanced by the ` hubble drag ' caused by the continuous expansion of the spatial scale . within this approximation fluid elements move ballistically , and",
    "the evolution of local perturbations is described by the following system of equations : @xmath0 expressing conservation of respectively mass and momentum . here",
    "@xmath1 is the new time parameter , @xmath2 is the mass density field , @xmath3 is the velocity field , @xmath4 is the spatial position comoving with the hubble expansion , and @xmath5 denotes the tensor with components  @xmath6 .",
    "when trajectories of fluid elements cross , the velocity field ceases to be single - valued , and several streams passing through the same spatial location form .",
    "numerical simulations show ( see e.g.@xcite ) that the gravitational interaction between streams confines the matter to domains of relatively small width and high density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aggreg ] on page  ) , causing it to aggregate in wall - like , filament - like , and cluster - like structures .",
    "this process is called _",
    "ballistic aggregation_.    in @xcite ( see also the monograph @xcite and @xcite ) the burgers equation @xmath7 was proposed to describe ballistic aggregation .",
    "indeed , in the vanishing viscosity limit @xmath8 solutions to the burgers equation develop singularities in the form of infinitesimally thin walls , filaments , and point clusters , whose shape is tantalizingly similar to the large - scale cosmological structure .",
    "however this agreement is limited , as the burgers equation is written in terms of the velocity field and fails to account for conservation of mass or momentum .",
    "quantitatively , direct @xmath9-body simulations of self - gravitating matter disagree with solutions of the burgers equation for identical initial data .",
    "these limitations can be overcome in the case of 1d flow with flat symmetry ( note that in the 1d case a thorough analytical study is possible even without the aggregation approximation @xcite ) .",
    "several authors @xcite independently introduced exact solutions for ballistic aggregation in a 1d flow of particles that stick upon collisions with exact conservation of mass and momentum . in particular , in @xcite and  @xcite these solutions were expressed in the form of variational principles , so that the density and velocity fields at any given time could be constructed by minimization of certain functionals .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to explore the possibility of extending these results to the case where there is no flat symmetry . in section  [ sec :",
    "flat ] we prove the equivalence of the variational principles proposed in   and   in the 1d case with flat symmetry . to make the exposition self - contained we recall the necessary details of constructions of and  , in particular because ref .",
    "is rather difficult to obtain . in section  [ sec : spherical ] the variational principles are extended to the case of cylindrical and spherical symmetry .",
    "both variational principles and   can be extended formally to the case of 2d or 3d non - symmetric flow , but the corresponding constructions no longer coincide .",
    "moreover , there exist counterexamples showing that neither variational principle is valid in its extended version already for non - symmetric 2d flows .",
    "the multidimensional extensions of the variational principles and   and explicit counterexamples are presented in section  [ sec : counterexamples ] .",
    "the second and third authors are grateful to the french ministry of education for its support .",
    "the work of sg was also supported by rfbr ( grant 050216517 ) and the russian leading schools in science support program ( nsh-5200.2006.2 ) . the work of as was supported by rfbr ( grant 050100824 ) .",
    "in the case of flat symmetry the density field  @xmath10 and the velocity field  @xmath11 both depend on a single coordinate .",
    "mass concentration due to inelastic collisions results in the formation of parallel massive ` walls ' in three - dimensional space , which can be considered as point - like structures ( clusters ) in the @xmath12 axis .",
    "we consider first the evolution of a purely discrete mass distribution .",
    "let @xmath9 particles in the @xmath12 axis be located initially ( i.e. , at @xmath13 ) at points @xmath14 and have velocities @xmath15 and masses @xmath16 . as time passes , @xmath17-th particle describes the trajectory @xmath18 unless it collides with another particle . after an inelastic collision there forms a cluster containing the whole mass of the group of particles that stuck together . since trajectories of free particles can not cross , such clusters will always contain groups of particles numbered contiguously , i.e. , with @xmath19 .",
    "mass , velocity and coordinate of each cluster coincide with the total mass and center - of - mass velocity and coordinate of the corresponding group of particles , defined for the free motion : @xmath20    in order for @xmath21-th particle to stay free at time  @xmath22 , its trajectory must not cross center - of - mass trajectories of any groups of particles immediately adjacent to it . therefore for any @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , the coordinate @xmath25 must satisfy the inequalities @xmath26 where @xmath27 using these conditions and equations  , one can find coordinates and masses of all particles and clusters at  @xmath28 without explicitly computing dynamics of the system at intermediate times . thus equations and   give a complete solution for a discrete initial mass distribution .    in the case of a continuous mass distribution",
    "the initial density and velocity fields are given by the functions @xmath29 and  @xmath30 .",
    "in this case one replaces summation in equations and   with integration , the index  @xmath17 with the continuous initial coordinate  @xmath31 , and mass of @xmath17-th particle with the mass element @xmath32 .",
    "equation   then assumes the form @xmath33 if these inequalities are satisfied for any @xmath34 and at least one of them is strict , the particle located initially at  @xmath35 will stay free at @xmath22 and will be located at @xmath36 .    on the other hand , let a group of particles located initially at @xmath37 stick together at time  @xmath1 into a cluster surrounded by free particles .",
    "then mass , velocity , and coordinate of this cluster are given by @xmath38 for any particle specified by the initial position  @xmath31 , equations and   together give its position @xmath39 at time @xmath40 without invoking the dynamics at intermediate times .",
    "there are two ways to construct an explicit formula for  @xmath39 from and  , which are discussed in the following two subsections .",
    "both of them involve minimizing suitable functionals and can therefore be considered as ( generalized ) variational principles .",
    "introduce in and   a ` mass coordinate ' @xmath41 and let @xmath42 the lower limits of integration in  , may be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "it can easily be checked that the inverse function  @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the form @xmath45 hence , as long as some particle is not absorbed into a cluster , its coordinate is @xmath46 however after crossing of trajectories this representation of @xmath47 breaks down . to give an expression for @xmath39 that is valid for all times ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the cases of a free particle and a cluster separately .    in the new variables ,",
    "condition ( [ eq : gprinciple ] ) determining if a particle stays free at time  @xmath22 takes the following form : if @xmath48 , then for any @xmath49 @xmath50 in other words , at values of  @xmath51 corresponding to free particles the function @xmath52 coincides with its convex hull @xmath53 , i.e. , the maximal convex function not exceeding  @xmath54 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : convex ] ) .",
    "one can visualize the graph of a convex hull as the shape of an elastic thread tightly wrapped around the graph of @xmath54 from below .",
    "since the function @xmath54 is differentiable , its convex hull is also differentiable , and at common points of their graphs the derivatives @xmath55 and @xmath56 coincide .",
    "therefore at these points equation   takes the form @xmath57    [ fig : convex ]   condition   is satisfied with any @xmath58 , while at @xmath59 it is violated ( e.g.  for @xmath60 , @xmath61 the slope of the left dotted line is positive while that of the right one is negative ) .",
    "on the segment  @xmath62 , the convex hull  @xmath63 ( dashed line ) does not coincide with  @xmath52 .",
    "thus particles corresponding to points of the segment  @xmath64 stick together and form a cluster of the mass  @xmath65 by the time  @xmath1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    conversely , if by the time  @xmath1 a group of particles initially located in the segment @xmath66 forms a cluster surrounded with free particles , then condition   is violated at all internal points of the corresponding segment @xmath67 and the graph of  @xmath52 lies above the chord connecting @xmath68 and  @xmath69 , and thus above the convex hull ( fig .  [ fig : convex ] ) . moreover , implies that @xmath70    thus in clusters as well as in intervals of continuous mass disribution the map @xmath39 is determined by the derivative of the convex hull of  @xmath54 : @xmath71 in  , this expression is called the generalized variational principle by analogy with the hopf  lax ",
    "olenik variational principle used to construct solutions to the burgers equation .",
    "the latter principle itself is a variant of the least action principle in mechanics . in the present paper , will be referred to as _ the variational principle  _ .",
    "analogous representations for @xmath47 were introduced independently in @xcite and  @xcite .    in the case of a constant initial density , when @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the variational principle coincides with the hopf  lax  olenik variational principle .",
    "another representation for @xmath39 was introduced a decade earlier by a.  i.  shnirelman in  . to simplify notation , introduce the _ displacement field _ @xmath74",
    "as long as trajectores of particles do not cross , @xmath75 holds and the coordinate  @xmath76 is monotonic as a function of  @xmath31 : @xmath77 whenever @xmath78 .",
    "we consider below only displacement fields for which the integral @xmath79 exists .",
    "this is the case if the initial density  @xmath80 and velocity  @xmath44 ( and therefore the displacement field ) either decrease at infinity fast enough or are periodical .",
    "call a displacement field _ feasible _ if trajectories of particles do not cross , i.e. , if condition   is satisfied for any @xmath78 .",
    "according to _ the variational principle  _ , the solution @xmath39 is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a feasible displacement field that minimizes the following norm of discrepancy with respect to @xmath83 : @xmath84    in the simplest case when trajectories of particles do not cross , @xmath85 ; this displacement field is feasible and therefore the discrepancy vanishes . after crossing of trajectories a feasible displacement field minimizing",
    "can no longer coincide with  @xmath86 .",
    "mathematically , minimization problem   is equivalent to the orthogonal projection of the field @xmath83 to the set of feasible displacements , which we denoted hereafter by  @xmath87 .",
    "here orthogonality is understood in the sense of the functional scalar product @xmath88 and the square of the norm of discrepancy   is its scalar poduct with itself : @xmath89 observe that feasible displacements form a convex set : if displacement fields @xmath90 , @xmath91 are feasible , then so is their ` mixture ' @xmath92 for any @xmath93 . moreover , a set of feasible displacements is closed : a limit of any sequence of feasible displacements is also feasible . it is a well - known fact of functional analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that an orthogonal projection to a closed set  @xmath87 exists and is defined uniquely .",
    "therefore the variational principle   always gives a uniquely defined result .",
    "we now show that this result coincides with the result given by the variational principle  .",
    "denote the displacement field defined by the map  @xmath39 from   by @xmath94 it suffices to check if this displacement field minimizes  , i.e. , if for any other feasible displacement  @xmath95 in  @xmath87 @xmath96 it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : orthoconvex ] that the orthogonal projection to the closed set  @xmath87 must satisfy an even stronger inequality , @xmath97 and it is this condition that we will check .     in a hilbert space .",
    "shown is a section of the set  @xmath87 with a hyperplane passing through the elements @xmath86 , @xmath98 and  @xmath95 .",
    "since the point  @xmath98 is closest to @xmath86 in the set  @xmath87 , this set lies outside the sphere determined by the radius @xmath99 .",
    "therefore in the triangle connecting @xmath86 , @xmath98 , and  @xmath95 the angle at @xmath98 must be obtuse ,",
    "i.e. , the square of the corresponding segment is larger than the sum of squares of two other segments ( inequality  ) . ]",
    "using   rewrite inequality   in the form @xmath100 and compute its left - hand side : @xmath101 observe that @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "this expression is nonzero on a set of segments  @xmath104 of the @xmath51 axis where @xmath105 is satisfied .",
    "therefore decomposes into a sum of integrals over segments @xmath106 , on each of which @xmath39 is constant , @xmath107 and the integrand in   is equal to the product of the continuous function @xmath108 with the function @xmath109 which decreases because @xmath110 is a feasible displacement field .",
    "according to bonnet s formula for the average value of the product of a monotonic and a continuous function is monotonic and  @xmath111 is continuous , then there exists a point  @xmath112 in the segment @xmath113 such that @xmath114 , there exists a point  @xmath115 in the segment  @xmath116 such that @xmath117    now take into account that at @xmath118 @xmath119 and this integral vanishes only when @xmath120 .",
    "therefore @xmath121 and finally @xmath122 thus the whole integral   is positive as a sum of positive terms .",
    "consequently , the displacement field @xmath123 satisfies the inequality   and minimizes the variational principle  .",
    "conversely , the unique optimal displacement field in   must minimize the variational principle  .",
    "let the initial density  @xmath124 and velocity  @xmath125 fields depend on the @xmath126-dimensional vector  @xmath127 and be symmetric with respect to the origin : @xmath128 for @xmath129 this symmetry is cylindrical and for @xmath130 , spherical .",
    "the results of this section hold for any @xmath131 , including the nonphysical case of higher dimensions .    to extend the construction of the variational principle   to this case one has to replace the mass element @xmath132 by @xmath133 in and  . here",
    "@xmath134 is the ( hyper)surface area of the unit sphere in @xmath126-dimensional space . arguing similarly to section  [ sec : clusters ] , introducing the mass coordinate @xmath135 and setting @xmath136 where @xmath137 we get an explicit solution that formally coincides with  , but with a new definition of the function  @xmath54 : @xmath138",
    "can the above explicit construction of solutions to the ballistic aggregation problem be extended to the case of non - symmetric flows ?",
    "an existence theorem for a solution to the ballistic aggregation problem that respects the mass   and momentum   conservation laws was proved in @xcite . however , this proof is non - constructive and thus gives little information about the structure of the solution and provides no method for approximating it numerically .    on the contrary , both variational principles and",
    "provide structural information and approximation procedures .",
    "moreover , for a potential initial velocity field @xmath139 these variational principles have natural multidimensional extensions requiring no specific assumptions on symmetry of the flow .",
    "however it is possible to construct examples of asymmetric flows for which these extensions give physically incorrect answers , as we show below .      to extend the variational principle   to the multidimensional case , introduce a vector `` mass ''",

    "it is possible to show that the proposed modification of the variational principle   leads to incorrect results .",
    "consider a spherical wave expanding fom the origin .",
    "suppose that initially matter is at rest while the velocity potential  @xmath150 is constant everywhere except a small area about the origin .",
    "asymptotically for large times the size of this area and details of the velocity field inside it become inessential and the initial velocity potential can be approximated with @xmath151 at time  @xmath40 the radius  @xmath152 of the spherical wave is defined by the derivative @xmath153 at @xmath154 , where @xmath155 so the proposed extension of the variational principle   predicts that the radius of the spherical wave grows as  @xmath156 regardless of the dimension of space .",
    "on the other hand , the full mass of the wave front at time  @xmath1 is equal to the mass of matter initially distibuted over the area contained within the wave front , i.e. , proportional to  @xmath157 , where @xmath129 in the cylindrical case and @xmath130 in spherical case .",
    "since matter moves only in radial directions , the full momentum is preserved in any cone with the vertex at the origin .",
    "hence the product of the velocity of the wave front by its mass must stay constant : @xmath158 , so that @xmath159 it is this time dependence of  @xmath160 that appears in section  [ sec : spherical ] , while and   turn out to hold only for  @xmath161 .",
    "it is interesting to determine the time dependence of the kinetic energy  @xmath162 .",
    "the full kinetic energy of the flow is the product of the mass of the vawe front by its squared radial velocity .",
    "accordingly , in the physically correct solution   we have @xmath163 , while formula   gives @xmath164 ; for @xmath130 , the kinetic energy of the spherical wave turns out to grow indefinitely !    although the choice of mass coordinates  @xmath147 is not uniquely determined by  @xmath124 alone , this freedom is not enough to resolve this contradiction . for a constant initial density  @xmath124",
    "one can show  @xcite that the only way to introduce mass coordinates while preserving the spherical symmetry is  .",
    "thus the convex hull construction of the variational principle   can not be extended to the non - symmetric multidimensional case .        to extend the variational principle to the multidimensional case , one has to define a set of feasible displacement fields in such a way that a solution to the ballistic aggregation problem would still be defined by an orthogonal projection construction .    in one dimension a displacement field  @xmath110 is feasible when the function @xmath165 is monotonic , or equivalently when its primitive function is convex .",
    "observe that , regardless of the dimension , the ` mixture ' of two convex functions @xmath166 ,  @xmath167 of the form @xmath168 , where @xmath169 , is always convex and that the differentiation operation is linear .",
    "therefore the class of gradients of convex functions in any dimension is a convex subset of a suitable functional space .",
    "call the displacement field @xmath170 _ feasible _ if @xmath171 is the gradient of a convex function .",
    "then a natural multidimensional extension of the variational principle   consists in minimizing the norm of discrepancy @xmath172 over the class of feasible displacement fields defined as above .      as long as the jacobian of the map @xmath176 is non - zero ( positive ) , trajectories of particles",
    "do not cross . since this jacobian coincides with the determinant of the matrix of second derivatives ( the hessian matrix ) @xmath177 , convexity of the function",
    "@xmath178 is preserved .",
    "therefore the displacement field @xmath179 stays feasible and the discrepancy norm   is equal to zero , so the proposed form of the variational principle gives a correct solution in this case .",
    "after crossing of two infinitesimally close trajectories the determinant of the hessian matrix vanishes , the function @xmath178 ceases to be convex , and the displacement field minimizing the   can no longer be given by  @xmath180 .",
    "similarly to the argument of section  [ sec : shnirelman ] one can show that in the spherically symmetric case the proposed form of the variational principle   gives a correct solution .",
    "however the following example shows that the proposed extension gives wrong results in less symmetrical cases .",
