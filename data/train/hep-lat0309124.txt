    "the non - perturbative nature of qcd provides various phenomena such as spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking and color confinement .",
    "currently , the rhic experiments are in progress to understand these phenomena , and the finite - temperature qcd becomes important . in this point , condensates are useful physical quantities because they characterize the nontrivial qcd vacuum . at finite temperature",
    ", the qcd vacuum is expected to change , and we can examine it from the thermal effects on the condensates .    among various condensates , we study the quark - gluon mixed condensate @xmath10 for the following reasons .",
    "first , we note that the mixed condensate is a chiral order parameter independent of @xmath11 , since it flips the chirality of the quark as @xmath15 therefore , @xmath10 , as well as @xmath11 , is an important indicator on the chiral structure of the qcd vacuum . in particular , the thermal effects on both the condensates and",
    "the comparison of them will reveal mechanism of the chiral restoration of the qcd vacuum at finite temperature .",
    "second , in contrast to @xmath11 , @xmath10 represents a direct correlation between quarks and gluons in the qcd vacuum , and thus characterizes different aspect of the qcd vacuum .",
    "third , the mixed condensate is relevant in various qcd sum rules , especially in baryons  @xcite , light - heavy mesons  @xcite and exotic mesons  @xcite . in this point ,",
    "the quantitative estimate of the thermal effects on @xmath10 has an impact on hadron phenomenology at finite temperature through the framework of the qcd sum rule .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to estimate @xmath10 at zero / finite temperature by a direct calculation from qcd , such as lattice qcd simulation .",
    "so far , the mixed condensate @xmath10 at zero temperature has been analyzed phenomenologically in the qcd sum rules  @xcite . in the lattice qcd , a pioneering work   has been done long time ago , but the result was rather preliminary .",
    "recently , new lattice calculations have been performed by us  @xcite using the kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermion , and by other group  @xcite using the domain - wall fermion . at finite temperature , however , there has been no result on @xmath10 except for our early results in ref .",
    "therefore , we here present the extensive results of the thermal effects on @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 , including the analysis near the critical temperature .",
    "we calculate the condensates @xmath11 and @xmath10 using the su(3)@xmath1 lattice qcd with the ks - fermion at the quenched level .",
    "we note that the ks - fermion preserves the explicit chiral symmetry for the quark mass @xmath16 , which is essential for our study .",
    "the monte carlo simulations are performed with the standard wilson action for @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in order to calculate at various temperatures , we use the following lattices as    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     we generate 100 gauge configurations for each lattice . however , in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition point , namely , @xmath19 at @xmath20 and @xmath21 at @xmath22 , the fluctuations of the condensates get larger .",
    "we hence generate 1000 gauge configurations for the above two lattices to improve the estimate .",
    "the lattice units are obtained as @xmath23 for @xmath24 , respectively , which reproduce the string tension @xmath25 .",
    "we calculate the flavor - averaged condensates as @xmath26 , \\ ] ] @xmath27 , \\ ] ] where su(4)@xmath28 quark - spinor fields , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are converted into spinless grassmann ks - fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the gauge - link variable .",
    "we adopt the clover - type definition for the gluon field strength @xmath33 on the lattice in order to eliminate @xmath34 discretization error .",
    "the more detailed formula for the condensates and gluon field strength are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the calculation of the condensates",
    ", we use the current - quark mass @xmath35 . for the fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 ,",
    "the anti - periodic condition is imposed at the boundary in the all directions .",
    "we measure the condensates on 16 different physical space - time points of @xmath36 ( @xmath2 ) or 2 points of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in each configuration .",
    "therefore , at each @xmath38 and temperature , we achieve high statistics in total as 1600 data ( @xmath2 ) or 200 data ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that in the vicinity of the critical temperature , @xmath19 ( @xmath40 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath41 ) , we take up to 2000 data so as to achieve high statistics and to guarantee reliability of the results .",
    "we calculate the condensates @xmath11 and @xmath10 at each quark mass and temperature .",
    "we observe that both the condensates show a clear linear behavior against the quark mass @xmath38 .",
    "typical plot can be seen in ref .",
    "therefore , we fit the data with a linear function and determine the condensates in the chiral limit . estimated statistical errors are typically less than 5% , while the finite volume artifact is estimated to be about 1% , from the dependence of the condensates on boundary conditions  @xcite .    for each condensate",
    ", we estimate the thermal effects by taking the ratio between the values at finite and zero temperature .",
    "this procedure eliminates the renormalization constants because there is no operator mixing for both the condensates in the chiral limit  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : qgq_finite_t ] , we plot the thermal effects on @xmath10 .",
    "we find a drastic change of @xmath10 around the critical temperature @xmath12 .",
    "this is a first observation of chiral - symmetry restoration in @xmath10 .",
    "we also find that the thermal effects on @xmath10 are very weak below the critical temperature , namely , @xmath42 .",
    "the same nontrivial features are also found for @xmath11 .",
    "we then compare the thermal effects on @xmath10 and @xmath11 , because these two condensates characterize different aspects of the qcd vacuum . for this purpose , we plot the thermal effects on @xmath44 in figure  [ fig : m0_finite_t ] . from figure  [ fig : m0_finite_t ] , we observe that @xmath14 is almost independent of the temperature , even in the very vicinity of @xmath8 .",
    "this very nontrivial result means that both of @xmath10 and @xmath11 obey the same critical behavior .",
    "this might indicate the existence of the universal behavior of chiral order parameters near @xmath8 , and would impose constraints on the chiral structure of the qcd vacuum .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the thermal effects on @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 from lattice qcd at the quenched level .",
    "we have found a clear signal of chiral restoration from both the condensates , while the thermal effects below @xmath8 are very weak .",
    "we have also observed that @xmath45 is almost independent of the temperature , which means both the condensates obey the same critical behavior .",
    "this nontrivial similarity would impose constraints on the chiral structure of the qcd vacuum near @xmath8 .",
    "for further studies , a full qcd lattice calculation is in progress in order to analyze the dynamical quark effects on the condensates ."
