    "nowadays we are experimenting a rapid development of technologies related to data storage . as an immediate consequence",
    ", we are often faced with huge databases hindering the access to information .",
    "thus , it is necessary to have techniques and tools able to discriminate elements from these massive databases .",
    "text categorization  @xcite , scene classification  @xcite and protein classification  @xcite are just a few examples where this problem emerges . in a parallel direction ,",
    "statistical physicists are increasingly interested in studying the so - called complex systems  @xcite .",
    "these investigations employ established methods of statistical mechanics as well as recent developments of this field aiming to extract hidden patterns that are governing the system s dynamics . in a similar way , this framework may help to advance in distinguishing elements within these databases , with the benefit of the simplicity often attributed to statistical physics methods .",
    "a very interesting case corresponds to the music databases , not only because of the incredible amount of data ( for instance , the itunes store has more than 14 million songs ) , but also due to the ubiquity of music in our society as well as its deeply connection with cognitive habits and historical developments  @xcite . in this direction , there are investigations focused on collective listening habits  @xcite , collaboration networks among artists  @xcite , music sales  @xcite , success of musicians  @xcite , among others . on the other hand , the sounds that compose the songs present several complex structures and emergent features which , in some cases , resemble very closely the patterns of out - of - equilibrium physics , such as scale - free statistics and universality .",
    "for instance , the seminal work of voss and clarke  @xcite showed that the power spectrum associated to the loudness variations and pitch fluctuations of radio stations ( including songs and human voice ) is characterized by @xmath0 noise - like pattern in the low frequency domain ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "klimontovich and boon  @xcite argue that this behavior for low - frequency follows from a natural flicker noise theory .",
    "however , this finding has been questioned by nettheim  @xcite and according to him the power spectrum may be better described by @xmath2 .",
    "fractal structures were also reported by hs and hs  @xcite when studying classical pieces concerning frequency intervals .",
    "it was also found that the distribution of sound amplitudes may be adjusted by a one - parameter stretched gaussian and that this non - gaussian feature is related to correlation aspects present in the songs  @xcite .",
    "these features and others have attracted the attention of statistical physicists , who have attempted to obtain some quantifiers able to distinguish songs and genres .",
    "one of these efforts was made by jennings et al .",
    "@xcite who found that the hurst exponent estimated from the volatility of the sound intensity depends on the music genre .",
    "correa et al .",
    "@xcite investigated four music genres employing a complex network representation for rhythmic features of the songs .",
    "there are still other investigations  @xcite , most of which are based on fractal dimensions , entropies , power spectrum analysis or correlation analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that there are several methods of automatic genre classification emerging from engineering disciplines ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "in particular , there exists a very active community working on music classification problems and several important results are published at the ismir  @xcite conferences ( just to mention a few please see refs .  @xcite . )",
    "however , the music genre it not a well defined concept  @xcite , and , specially , the boundaries between genres still remain fuzzy .",
    "thus , any taxonomy may be controversial , representing a challenging and open problem of pattern recognition .",
    "in addition , some of the proposed quantifiers require specific algorithms or recipes for processing the sound of the songs , which may depend on tuning parameters .    here , we follow an information theory approach trying to quantify aspects of songs . more specifically , the bandt and pompe approach  @xcite is applied in order to obtain a complexity hierarchy for songs .",
    "this method defines a `` natural '' complexity measure for time series based on ordinal patterns .",
    "although this concept has not been explored yet within the context of music , it has been successfully applied in other areas , such as medical  @xcite , financial  @xcite and climatological time series  @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "our main goal is to fill this hiatus employing the bandt and pompe approach together with a non - trivial entropic measure  @xcite , constructing the so - called complexity - entropy causality plane  @xcite .",
    "as it will be discussed in detail below , we have found that this representation space is very promising to distinguish songs from huge databases .",
    "moreover , thanks to the simple and fast implementation it is possible to conjecture its use in practical situations . in the following , we review some aspects related to the bandt and pompe approach as well as the complexity - entropy causality plane ( section 2 ) .",
    "next , we describe our database and the results ( section 3 ) .",
    "finally , we end this work with some concluding comments ( section 4 ) .",
    "the essence of the permutation entropy proposed by bandt and pompe  @xcite is to associate a symbolic sequence to the time series under analysis .",
    "this is done by employing a suitable partition based on ordinal patterns obtained by comparing neighboring values of the original series . to be more specific ,",
    "consider a given time series @xmath3 and the following partitions represented by a @xmath4-dimensional vector ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "for each one of these @xmath8 vectors , we investigate the permutations of @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 , and , for all @xmath11 possible permutations of @xmath12 , we evaluate the probability distribution @xmath13 given by @xmath14 where the symbol @xmath15 stands for the number ( frequency ) of occurrences of the permutation @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we define the normalized permutation entropy of order by @xmath16=\\frac{s[p]}{\\log d\\,!}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath17 $ ] being the standard shannon s entropy  @xcite . naturally , @xmath18 \\leq 1 $ ] , where the upper bound occurs for a completely random system , i.e. , a system for which all @xmath19 possible permutations are equiprobable . if the time series exhibits some kind of ordering dynamics @xmath20 $ ] will be smaller than one . as pointed out by bandt and pompe  @xcite , the advantages in using this method lie on its simplicity , robustness and very fast computational evaluation .",
    "clearly , the parameter @xmath4 ( known as embedding dimension ) plays an important role in the estimation of the permutation probability distribution @xmath21 , since it determines the number of accessible states .",
    "in fact , the choice of @xmath4 depends on the length @xmath22 of the time series in such a way that the condition @xmath23 must be satisfied in order to obtain a reliable statistics . for practical purposes , bandt and pompe",
    "recommend @xmath24 . here , we have fixed @xmath25 because the time series under analysis are large enough ( they have more than one million of data values ) .",
    "we have verified that the results are robust concerning the choice of the embedding dimension @xmath4 .    advancing with this brief revision",
    ", we now introduce another statistical complexity measure able to quantify the degree of physical structure present in a time series  @xcite .",
    "given a probability distribution @xmath21 , this quantifier is defined by the product of the normalized entropy @xmath26 , and a suitable metric distance between @xmath21 and the uniform distribution @xmath27 .",
    "mathematically , we may write @xmath28=q_j[p , p_e]\\,h_s[p]\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 = \\frac{s[(p+p_e)/2 ] - s[p]/2 - s[p_e]/2}{q_{\\text{max}}}\\,\\ ] ] and @xmath30 is the maximum possible value of @xmath31 $ ] , obtained when one of the components of @xmath21 is equal to one and all the others vanish , i.e. , @xmath32\\,.\\ ] ] the quantity @xmath33 , usually known as disequilibrium , will be different from zero if there are more likely states among the accessible ones .",
    "it is worth noting that the complexity measure @xmath34 is not a trivial function of the entropy  @xcite because it depends on two different probability distributions , the one associated to the system under analysis , @xmath21 , and the uniform distribution , @xmath35 .",
    "it quantifies the existence of correlational structures , providing important additional information that may not be carried only by the permutation entropy .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that for a given @xmath26 value , there exists a range of possible @xmath34 values  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the previous discussion , rosso et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to employ a diagram of @xmath34 versus @xmath26 for distinguishing between stochasticity and chaoticity .",
    "this representation space , called complexity - entropy causality plane  @xcite , herein will be our approach for distinguishing songs .",
    "the concept of ordinal patterns can be straightforward generalized for non - consecutive samples , introducing a lag of @xmath36 ( usually known as embedding delay ) sampling times . with @xmath37 the consecutive case",
    "is recovered , and the analysis focuses on the highest frequency contained within the time series .",
    "it is clear that different time scales are taken into account by changing the embedding delays of the symbolic reconstruction .",
    "the importance of selecting an appropriate embedding delay in the estimation of the permutation quantifiers has been recently confirmed for different purposes , like identifying intrinsic time scales of delayed systems  @xcite , quantifying the degree of unpredictability of the high - dimensional chaotic fluctuations of a semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback  @xcite , and classifying cardiac biosignals  @xcite .",
    "we have found that an embedding delay @xmath37 is the optimal one for our music categorization goal since when this parameter is increased the permutation entropy increases and the permutation statistical complexity decreases .",
    "thus , the range of variation of both quantifiers is smaller and , consequently , it is more difficult to distinguish songs and genres .",
    "it is clear that a music piece can be naturally considered as the time evolution of an acoustic signal and time irreversibility is inherent to musical expression  @xcite . from the physical point of view",
    ", the songs may be considered as pressure fluctuations traveling through the air .",
    "these waves are perceived by the auditory system leading the sense of hearing . in the case of recordings ,",
    "these fluctuations are converted into a voltage signal by a record system and then stored , for instance , in a compact disc ( cd ) .",
    "the perception of sound is usually limited to a certain range of frequencies - for human beings the full audible range is approximately between 20 hz and 20 khz .",
    "because of this limitation the record systems often employ a sampling rate of 44.1 khz encompassing all the previous spectrum .",
    "all the songs analyzed here have this sampling rate .",
    "our database consists of 10124 songs distributed into ten different music genres , they are : blues ( 1020 ) , classical ( 997 ) , flamenco ( 679 ) , hiphop ( 1000 ) , jazz ( 700 ) , metal ( 1638 ) , brazilian popular music - mpb ( 580 ) , pop ( 1000 ) , tango ( 1016 ) and techno ( 1494 ) . the songs were chosen aiming to cover a large number of composers and singers . to achieve this and also to determine the music genre via an external judgment",
    ", we tried to select cds that are compilations of a given genre or from representative musical groups of a given genre .        by using the previous database",
    ", we focus our analysis on two times series directly obtained from the digitized files that represent each song - the sound amplitude series and the sound intensity series , i.e. , the square of the amplitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample ] shows these two time series for several songs . we evaluate the normalized entropy @xmath26 and the statistical complexity measure @xmath34 for the amplitude and intensity series associated to each song as shown in figs .  [ fig : plane]a and [ fig : plane]b .",
    "notice that both series , amplitude and intensity , lead to similar behavior , contrarily to what happens with other quantifiers .",
    "for instance , when dealing with hurst exponent is preferable to work with the intensities  @xcite or volatilities  @xcite , since the amplitudes are intrinsically anti - correlated due the oscillatory nature of the sound .",
    "moreover , we have found that there is a large range of @xmath26 and @xmath34 possible values .",
    "this wide variation allows a relative comparison among songs and someone may ask to listen songs that are limited within some interval of @xmath26 and/or @xmath34 values .",
    "we also evaluate the mean values of @xmath34 and @xmath26 over all songs grouped by genre as shown by figs .",
    "[ fig : plane]c and [ fig : plane]d .",
    "these mean values enable us to quantify the complexity of each music genre .",
    "in particular , we can observe that high art music genres ( e.g. classic , jazz and tango ) are located in the central part of the complexity plane , being equally distant from the fully aleatory limit ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and also from the completely regular case ( @xmath40 and @xmath39 ) . on the other hand , light / dance music genres ( e.g. pop and techno )",
    "are located closer to the fully aleatory limit ( white noise ) . in this context",
    ", our approach agrees with other works  @xcite .     versus @xmath26 for all the songs when considering the ( a ) amplitude series and ( b ) the intensity series . in ( c ) and ( d ) , we show the mean value of @xmath34 and @xmath26 for each genre . the upper ( bottom ) dashed line represents the maximum ( minimum ) value of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath25 and the different symbols refer to the 10 different genres . for a better visualization of the different genres",
    "see also figs .",
    "[ fig : ampgenre ] and [ fig : intgenre ] . ]     as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath25 and the arrows are indicating the shuffled analysis . ]     as a function of @xmath26 for @xmath25 and the arrows are indicating the shuffled analysis . ]",
    "therefore , we have verified that the ordinal pattern distribution that exists among the sound amplitudes values and also among the sound intensity is capable to spread out our database songs though the complexity - entropy causality plane .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the embedding dimension employed here ( @xmath25 ) corresponds to approximately @xmath41 seconds .",
    "thus , it is surprising how this very short time dynamics retains so much information about the songs .",
    "we also investigated shuffled version of each song series aiming to verify if the localization of the songs in the complexity - entropy causality plane is directly related to the presence of correlations in the music time series .",
    "this analysis is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ampgenre ] and [ fig : intgenre ] for each song and for all genres .",
    "we have obtained @xmath42 and @xmath43 for all shuffled series , confirming that correlations inherently present in the original songs are the main source for the different locations in this plane .",
    "although our approach is not focused on determining which music genre is related to a particular given song , this novel physical method may help to understand the complex situation that emerges in the problem of automatic genre classification .",
    "for instance , we can take a glance on the fuzzy boundaries existent in the music genre definitions , by evaluating the distribution of @xmath26 and @xmath34 values .",
    "figure [ fig : pdfs ] shows these distributions for both time series employed here .",
    "there are several overlapping regions among the distributions of @xmath26 and @xmath34 for the different genres .",
    "this overlapping is an illustration on how fuzzy the boundaries between genres and , consequently , the own concept of music genre can be .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that some genres have more localized pdfs , for instance , the techno genre is practically bounded to the interval @xmath44 of @xmath26 values for the intensity series while the flamenco or mpb genres have a wider distribution . to go beyond the previous analysis",
    ", we try to quantify the efficiency of permutation indexes @xmath26 and @xmath34 in a practical scenery of automatic genre classification . in order to do this ,",
    "we use an implementation  @xcite of a support vector machine ( svm )  @xcite where we have considered the values of @xmath26 and @xmath34 for the amplitudes and intensity series as features of the svm .",
    "we run the analysis for each genre training the svm with 90@xmath45 of dataset and performing an automatic detection over the remaining 10@xmath45 .",
    "it is a simplified version of the svm , where the system have to make a binary choice , i.e. , to choose between a given genre and all the others .",
    "the accuracy rates of automatic detection are shown in table [ tab : svm ] .",
    "note that the accuracy values are around 90@xmath45 within this simplified implementation , however we have to remark that in a multiple choice system these values should be much smaller . on the other hand , this analysis indicates that the entropic indexes employed here may be used in practical situations .    lrclr genre & accuracy & & genre & accuracy + blues & 87.87@xmath45 & & metal & 89.89@xmath45 + classic & 92.03@xmath45 & & mpb & 97.15@xmath45 + flamenco & 95.12@xmath45 & & pop & 88.11@xmath45 + hiphop & 88.11@xmath45 & & tango & 87.87@xmath45 + jazz & 91.68@xmath45 & & techno & 87.14@xmath45 +     and ( b ) @xmath34 when considering the amplitude series grouped by music genre .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show the same pdfs for the intensity series . ]",
    "summing up , in this work we applied the permutation entropy  @xcite , @xmath26 , and an intensive statistical complexity measure  @xcite , @xmath34 , to differentiate songs .",
    "specifically , we analyzed the location of the songs in the complexity - entropy causality plane .",
    "this permutation information theory approach enabled us to quantitatively classify songs in a kind of complexity hierarchy .",
    "we believe that the findings presented here may be applied in practical situations as well as in technological applications related to the distinction of songs in massive databases . in this aspect",
    ", the bandt and pompe approach has some advantageous technical features , such as its simplicity , robustness , and principally a very fast numerical evaluation .",

    "<S> nowadays we are often faced with huge databases resulting from the rapid growth of data storage technologies . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true when dealing with music databases . in this context , it is essential to have techniques and tools able to discriminate properties from these massive sets . in this work , we report on a statistical analysis of more than ten thousand songs aiming to obtain a complexity hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the estimation of the permutation entropy combined with an intensive complexity measure , building up the complexity - entropy causality plane . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained indicate that this representation space is very promising to discriminate songs as well as to allow a relative quantitative comparison among songs </S>",
    "<S> . additionally , we believe that the here - reported method may be applied in practical situations since it is simple , robust and has a fast numerical implementation .    permutation entropy , music , complexity measure , time series analysis </S>"
