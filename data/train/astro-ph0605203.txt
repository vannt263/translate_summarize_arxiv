    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite is both an imaging and spectroscopic survey of a quarter of the sky . imaging part of the survey takes ccd images of the sky in five optical bands ( @xmath0 and @xmath1)@xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic part of the survey observes one million galaxies .",
    "due to its large quantity and superb quality , the sdss provides us with an excellent data set to tackle the long standing problems on environmental effects on galaxy evolution .",
    "the sdss cut & enhance galaxy cluster catalog ( ce)@xcite is one of the initial attempts to produce a cluster catalog from the sdss imaging data .",

    "using a volume limited sample of 7938 spectroscopic galaxies ( 0.05@xmath3z@xmath30.1 , @xmath4 - 20.5 ) , we investigated the morphology  cluster - centric - radius relation in the sdss @xcite .",
    "we classified galaxies using the @xmath5 method , which utilizes concentration and coarseness of galaxies ( see @xcite for more details of @xmath5 ) .",

    "around 0.3 @xmath6 , s0 starts to decrease and e starts to increase .",
    "these two changes imply there might be two different physical mechanisms responsible for cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "since a physical size of s0 galaxies ( @xmath5=0 ) is smaller than e and sc ( @xmath5=2 and -1 ) in fig.[goto : fig : size ] , the results are consistent with the hypothesis that in the cluster outskirts , stripping creates small s0 galaxies from spiral galaxies and , in the cluster cores , the merging of s0s results in a large es .    .",

    "these galaxies are called `` passive spiral galaxies '' , and interesting since they are against currently favored galaxy formation models in which star - formation is sustained by the density waves . using a volume - limited sample ( 0.05@xmath90.1 and @xmath10 ; 25813 galaxies ) of the sdss data",

    "it is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsible for all of these observational results in the cluster infalling regions .",
    "the existence of passive spiral galaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that works calmly ( e.g. , gas stripping ) is preferred to dynamical origins such as major merger / interaction since such a mechanism would destroy the spiral - arm structures .",
