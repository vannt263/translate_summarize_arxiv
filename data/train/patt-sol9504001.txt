    "chaos is the name given to intrinsic random behavior arising in a deterministic system @xcite .",
    "the simplest forms of chaos occur in systems of three or more coupled ordinary differential equations and in discrete mappings .",
    "a great deal is known about such systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying `` temporal chaos '' , where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail .",
    "spatially extended systems with many interacting degrees of freedom exhibit `` spatiotemporal chaos '' @xcite , in which the chaotic fluctuations occur on spatial scales as well as in time .",
    "spatiotemporal chaos has also been called `` weak turbulence '' , `` defect chaos '' , and `` defect turbulence '' .",
    "( this is to be distinguished from fully developed turbulence , which typically occurs for increasing driving but fixed size @xmath1 , while spatiotemporal chaos occurs for fixed large driving but increasing @xmath1 . )",
    "there have been a number of approaches used in attempting to understand spatiotemporal chaos : partial differential equations , coupled ordinary differential equations ( in which space is discretized ) , coupled map lattices @xcite ( in which space and time are discretized ) , and cellular automata ( in which space , time , and dependent variable are discretized ) . for large systems , we may hope to use a statistical description of the chaotic states , borrowing concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "we wish to find simple reduced descriptions , emphasizing the collective behavior of many chaotic degrees of freedom , analogous to the reduced long  wavelength description provided by thermodynamics and hydrodynamics for equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "typically , spatiotemporal chaos appears in nonequilibrium pattern  forming systems slightly above their threshold of instability @xcite .",
    "the study of spatiotemporal chaos has been advanced by the development of experimental systems which are precisely controlled and have a large aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "such systems have large statistically homogeneous regions relatively free from boundary effects . a key question to address",
    "is whether such regions can be described in terms of hydrodynamic  like theories , focusing on collective behaviors and long  wavelength descriptions .",
    "we wish to address an aspect of this question by considering the coherent structures known as topological defects ( or spirals or vortices ) in a system that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos : the complex ginzburg  landau equation @xcite .",
    "this equation describes the slowly varying amplitude and phase in an extended system which undergoes a supercritical hopf bifurcation to an oscillating and spatially uniform or oscillatory and spatially periodic state .",
    "the equation exhibits many interesting patterns , but we will restrict our investigation to the benjamin  feir unstable ( or defect turbulent ) regime @xcite , in which topological defects occur in the context of spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "other systems , such as rayleigh  bnard convection @xcite , electrohydrodynamic convection in liquid crystals @xcite , capillary ripples @xcite , cardiac tissue @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , and wide aperture lasers @xcite , can exhibit similar defect  turbulent behavior . here",
    ", we will examine the defect ",
    "defect correlation functions and relate them to the ideas of generic scale invariance , which is a theory for describing nonequilibrium systems with conservation laws .",
    "we will prove that the generic predictions can not be correct for topological defect correlations .",
    "finally , we will see that our numerical results do not agree with the predictions of generic scale invariance @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ cglsec : cgleqn ]",
    "we discuss briefly the complex ginzburg  landau equation .",
    "the numerical technique that we use to solve this equation is discussed in section [ cglsec : nummethod ] .",
    "some interesting results that do nt depend solely upon the defects in the system are presented in section [ cglsec : aresults ] . in section [ cglsec : gsi ]",
    "we briefly describe the ideas behind generic scale invariance , and relate these ideas to the topological defects in the complex ginzburg  landau equation .",
    "constraints on the behavior of the defects due to their topological nature are discussed in section [ cglsec : constraints ] .",
    "the predictions of generic scale invariance , as well as that from the constraints , are compared with numerical results in section [ cglsec : numerics ] .",

    "perturbative analyses of microscopic equations for various pattern  forming systems yield complex partial differential equations which go under the name `` amplitude equations '' . considered in their own right as model dynamical systems which do not necessarily describe any real physical system , these equations are referred to as ginzburg  landau models .",
    "it is important to note the role of these ginzburg ",
    "landau equations as model equations .",
    "many properties of nonequilibrium systems are encountered in these equations .",
    "many hard problems , such as the existence and interaction of defects and coherent structures , or the appearance of chaos , can be profitably addressed in the simple framework provided by these equations .",
    "however , these equations provide a quantitative description of real experiments valid only in a small region near the transition threshold for a pattern .",
    "far from threshold , only the phase of the complex field survives as a slow degree of freedom , since it describes a symmetry of the system .",
    "the magnitude of the complex field only becomes slow near threshold ; far away it is just one of the many fast degrees of freedom .",
    "we wish to consider spatiotemporal chaos and topological defects in an equation that has been used both as an `` amplitude equation '' in the sense discussed above as well as a model equation to study generic features of spatially extended nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "we are using the equation as a model equation for spatiotemporal chaos ; its applicability to real physical systems is limited to the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "the complex ginzburg  landau equation we consider is given by @xmath2 where @xmath0 is a complex field in two dimensions ( see for example @xcite ) . by rescaling @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , we obtain the following equation ( dropping now the primes ) : @xmath10 this equation can have topological defect solutions where @xmath11 ( both @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] are zero ) @xcite .",
    "these defects can occur either in static arrangements or in dynamic ones .",
    "the dynamics states can have defects moving in a regular fashion ( for example , all defects drifting in one direction ) or they can exhibit defect turbulence , where defects are continuously nucleated and annihilated in pairs and are moving about in a chaotic , non - regular fashion .",
    "we wish to focus on the latter case , the benjamin  feir turbulent instability regime @xcite , which occurs when @xmath14 . in this region of parameter",
    "space , all spatially periodic solutions of the complex ginzburg  landau equation are unstable . for comparison with the ideas of generic scale invariance @xcite",
    ", we will focus on the anisotropic case @xmath15 .",
    "the topological defects come in two varieties .",
    "the type of defect depends on how the phase of @xmath0 changes as we travel counterclockwise once around the defect .",
    "a defect with a phase jump of @xmath16 has a topological charge of @xmath17 , while one with a jump of @xmath18 has a topological charge of @xmath19 .",
    "this is analogous to the right  handed and left  handed single ",
    "armed spirals in belousov  zhabotinskii reactions @xcite .",
    "let @xmath20 equal the density of @xmath17 defects and @xmath21 equal the density of @xmath19 defects .",
    "we can then define a `` topological '' order parameter , @xmath22 , which is just the density of the defects weighted by their topological charge .",
    "this order parameter is conserved in a system with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath23 , as defects can only be created or destroyed in @xmath24 pairs .",
    "we focus on the order parameter @xmath25 as an effective coarse  grained field , which , for the purpose of testing the applicability of generic scale invariance , we conjecture can be described by some hydrodynamic equation of motion .",
    "figure [ cglfig : snapshot ] is a snapshot of the simulated system , showing the two types of defects , and lines of @xmath26 = 0 $ ] and @xmath27 = 0 $ ] .",
    "although the time evolution of ensembles of defects is very complicated , considerable progress has been made in the study of the dynamics of isolated or weakly interacting defects .",
    "defects are isolated singularities in the phase equation ( for the phase of @xmath0 ) , but are smooth solutions of the full equations .",
    "it is an attractive idea to imagine a description in terms of coupled dynamics of phase and defect degrees of freedom .",
    "progress on this idea has been made in the case of rayleigh  bnard convection @xcite and the kuramoto ",
    "sivaskinsky equation @xcite ; for a review of the situation in the complex ginzburg  landau equation see @xcite .",
    "the complex ginzburg  landau equation has also been studied in one dimension , where it also exhibits spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "much effort has been made in this case to apply ideas from low  dimensional chaos , such as lyapunov exponents and dimension densities @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that such ideas will be applicable to spatiotemporal chaos in general , or to the two  dimensional complex ginzburg  landau equation with topological defects in particular . in one ",
    "dimension , an important question , still unsettled , is whether phase turbulence ( turbulence without strong amplitude fluctuations ) exists @xcite .",
    "in contrast , even an apparent phase turbulence regime has not been seen in the two  dimensional complex ginzbug  landau equation .",
    "the two dimensions ( one versus two  dimensional ) may very well be fundamentally different .",
    "numerical simulations can provide insight into the relationship between these regimes .",
    "equation ( [ cgleqn : cgl ] ) is a continuum equation .",
    "we wish to put it in a form that allows approximate solution on a computer , which requires a discretization scheme , an eigenfunction expansion scheme , or some combination of both .",
    "we use a technique that combines elements of both approaches ; it is a spectral method ( for a general review of this see @xcite ) .",
    "this is a special form of a more general technique known as the method of weighted residuals @xcite .",
    "our original code was obtained from p. coullet , l. gil , and j. lega ( see references @xcite ) , and is now used as the basis for simulations by several groups . the original code was simply the solution to the differential equation .",
    "we have optimized the code , speeding it up by a factor of @xmath28 ; furthermore , we have added sections for analysis of defects and fourier space quantities .    to begin our discussion of the numerical solution algorithm , we rewrite equation ( [ cgleqn : cgl ] ) as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . now",
    ", if we knew the exact solution , equation ( [ cgleqn : newcgl ] ) would be satisfied everywhere in space .",
    "however , we can only use a finite number of basis functions or grid points in a numerical solution method , so the solution we obtain is necessarily approximate . in order to make this approximation systematic",
    ", we define the residual @xmath33 for the numerical solution . in order for our numerical solution to be an accurate approximation to the full solution ,",
    "this residual needs to be small .",
    "there are a number techniques that accomplish this and also fall under the general name `` method of weighted residuals '' @xcite .    to formulate the numerical solution , the field @xmath34",
    "is expanded @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some basis function",
    ". then we demand that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is our weighting function .",
    "a variety of numerical techniques follow this general procedure .",
    "for example , if the basis set @xmath39 is the same as @xmath40 then the method is known as a galerkin technique .",
    "the finite element method can also be written in this general form @xcite .",
    "we use the `` fourier collocation '' method @xcite .",
    "note that we are always using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for other types of boundaries ( such as @xmath41 at the boundaries ) , we could use fourier sine transforms and expand in a basis set of sine waves .",
    "our approach is to use @xmath42 where @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this is the `` fourier '' part . for the `` collocation '' , the residual",
    "is forced to be zero at the lattice points by choosing a set of delta functions for the weight functions @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    at this point",
    "we define our conventions for the fourier transform .",
    "the forward transform is @xmath51 and the inverse transform is @xmath52 we calculate the fourier transforms in the algorithm using ibm s engineering and scientific subroutine library ( essl ) fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite .",

    "we also have started our systems with two different types of initial conditions .",
    "the results do not depend upon which we choose .",
    "one initial condition is to seed the system with two oppositely charged topological defects .",

    "the exponential decay of the @xmath0@xmath0 correlation function has been observed in previous simulations @xcite , and it was suggested by these authors that the defects are responsible for the strong decorrelation of the field .",
    "we can merely note here that the field @xmath34 is not conserved in time .",
    "this lack of a conservation law would imply , within the framework of generic scale invariance discussed below in section [ cglsec : gsi ] , that the field  field correlation function should decay exponentially .    in figure [ cglfig : avgsk ]",

    "we wish to examine another possible approach for describing the system , namely , generic scale invariance .",
    "in equilibrium systems , spatial correlations typically decay exponentially . for nonequilibrium systems , such as those with an external driving force , the situation can be quite different . for a nonequilibrium system with a conservation law and external noise ,",
    "spatial correlation functions can decay algebraically .",

    "finally , we conjecture that the chaotic noise in our system plays the role of stochastic noise , again for the purpose of testing the applicability of generic scale invariance .    with this set of conditions",

    "we shall compare this prediction to the results from our numerics .",
    "the ideas behind generic scale invariance depend upon showing that nonlinearities in the equations are irrelevant in a renormalization group sense .",
    "this means that as the scale on which the system is examined grows , the importance of the nonlinearities in the dynamics at the larger scale is less important .",
    "this analysis is usually carried out in a perturbative manner , where the strength of the nonlinear term is the small expansion parameter .",

    "the constraint arises from the fact that any excess of topological defects in a region must be detectable simply by traversing the perimeter of that region .",
    "each topological defect has an `` arm '' with characteristic width that must pass through the perimeter of the region .",
    "examples of this are the spiral arms of the defects in rayleigh",

    "since the maximum excess number of topological objects scales linearly with the number of lines , and the number of lines scales as the perimeter of the region , we must have that the maximum excess number of topological objects scales as the linear size @xmath1 of the region .",

    "now we average over the noise ( or over space and time , depending upon how you wish to look at it ) @xmath178 this then gives the constraint equation @xmath179 we now make the assumption that we can write @xmath180 in the form @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the angle for @xmath183 and @xmath184 . strictly speaking ,",

    "splitting the integral into two parts yields @xmath206 we consider each of these terms separately .",
    "the second term can be bounded in the following manner : @xmath207 expanding the integral of @xmath187 in descending powers of @xmath1 gives @xmath208 we calculate the first integral in equation ( [ cgleqn : appsplit ] ) next .",

    "the leading order behavior of @xmath219 is then @xmath220 recall that the result for generic scale invariance is the case @xmath216 ( see equation ( [ cgleqn : gingsi ] ) ) .",

    "generic scale invariance predicts @xmath216 .",
    "the simple geometric nature of topological objects prevents them from having correlation functions that decay as certain power laws .",
    "( a decay of @xmath222 for @xmath223 satisfies our bounds on @xmath224 , but contradicts the predictions of generic scale invariance . )",
    "an added conclusion from the consideration of the topological constraints is that if the topological objects form ordered states , they must be of the antiferromagnetic variety ( _ e.g. _ alternating @xmath225 and @xmath226 vortices ) in at least one direction , in order to satisfy the topological constraint .",
    "an example of such a state in the complex ginzburg  landau equation has been seen , with defects ordering along chains where the defects in one chain are of opposite sign from the defects in neighboring chains @xcite .    in our analysis we have only considered the largest possible fluctuations .",
    "we expect these fluctuations to be rare , and hence expect a faster decay than the bound we provide . as an analogy , for nontopological objects",
    "the analysis presented here would predict that the correlation function can be at most a constant for large r ; in practice , systems like spins or atoms have connected correlation functions that decay to zero , either as power laws or as exponentials . however , it is often true that inequalities in physics are saturated , especially in relationships between critical exponents for phase transitions .",
    "this could be the case here , but numerically it appears that we do not saturate this bound , as will be shown in section [ cglsec : numerics ] below .",
    "one further point that we should consider is the splitting of the correlation function into angular and radial components .",
    "we mentioned above that this is important for our analysis .",
    "we can not explicitly show this for the topological defects , but we can demonstrate this splitting in the context of generic scale invariance . starting with the general result for the correlation function @xmath227",
    "we then define @xmath228 where @xmath229 .",
    "then @xmath230 performing the @xmath182 integral yields @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the zeroth order bessel function .",
    "note that this expression is not in general zero .",
    "we can give a concrete expression , in a particular limit , for @xmath233 .",
    "we begin with specific expressions for @xmath234 and @xmath235 , and ignore questions of convergence of the integrals for large @xmath62 .",
    "consider @xmath236 the @xmath57 integral can be performed as a contour integral ; the expression has poles at @xmath237 .",
    "we assume for ease of calculation the @xmath238 and @xmath239 ; the results are the same for other cases . when @xmath240 , we close the contour in the upper half of the complex @xmath57 plane , enclosing the pole at @xmath241 . for @xmath242",
    "we enclose the pole at @xmath243 .",
    "the integral then becomes @xmath244 times the residue at @xmath245 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath246 by performing the @xmath247 integrals we obtain ( using @xmath248 and @xmath249 ) @xmath250 note that our results are for the case @xmath251 , so we have for this simple example the result that the angular average is not zero .",
    "also , equation ( [ cgleqn : finalcorr ] ) is explicitly split into a radial and angular component .",
    "we have numerically solved equation ( [ cgleqn : cgl ] ) with periodic boundary conditions in the turbulent regime using a fourier collocation code .",

    "the time step used was @xmath87 .",
    "we initially `` equilibrate '' from a state with two oppositely charged defects to a state with fluctuations about some average number of defects .",
    "this typically takes @xmath259 time steps .",
    "we note that the defects do not form bound pairs .",
    "when a pair is created , the defects tend to move apart , and when they eventually annihilate , they usually do so with a defect other than their initial partner .",
    "this illustrates that the system is not in a kosterlitz  thouless bound pair phase @xcite .",
    "figure [ cglfig : snapshot ] shows a snapshot of part of our system .",
    "topological defects have been studied in systems undergoing phase ordering . in these systems",
    "( an example is the xy model ) the existence of an underlying hamiltonian allows analytic progress to be made @xcite in the form of perturbation expansions .",
    "some numerical work has also been performed on these systems @xcite . for our system ,",
    "the numerical results are key as we can not form perturbation expansions due to the lack of an underlying hamiltonian .",
    "these numerical calculations must begin with the determination of the location of the defects .    to find the defects in our system , we examine the change in the phase of @xmath0 as each plaquette ( or square unit cell ) on our lattice in real space",
    "is traversed counterclockwise . to do this , we examine the phase @xmath260 as we go around a plaquette on the lattice and sum up the phase differences between the four points in the plaquette .",
    "a change of @xmath261 signifies that the plaquette does not contain a defect , while changes of @xmath262 reveal that a defect exists in the plaquette .",
    "we can actually speed up the defect finding process a bit .",
    "if all four sites in the plaquette have the same sign of @xmath26 $ ] or of @xmath27 $ ] , then the plaquette can not contain a defect .",
    "more complicated situations can also be handled , such as where one corner of the plaquette is of a different sign from the other three corners for @xmath26 $ ] , while the opposite corner from the original one is of a different sign from the other three corners for @xmath27 $ ] . in this case",
    ", the plaquette can not contain a defect .",
    "these considerations avoid the costly calculation of @xmath263 , and can be used for a large fraction of the plaquettes in the lattice .    once we have found the defects , we can calculate @xmath264 , the total number of defects in the system , and @xmath156 . to do the averaging , we have run for @xmath265 time steps .",
    "we only sample @xmath156 and @xmath264 every @xmath266 time steps , because adjacent time steps are not statistically independent .",
    "we have calculated that @xmath267 , with @xmath268 time steps .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite that the probability of finding a particular value of @xmath90 in the system is given by @xmath269 .",
    "we have calculated the various moments of our distribution @xmath270 , and we find @xmath271 , @xmath272 , as well as a skewness of @xmath273 and a kurtosis of @xmath274 , which is in good agreement with the predictions from reference @xcite . in figure",
    "[ cglfig : probn ] , we present a plot of the results for @xmath270 together with the fitted exponential .",
    "the agreement is quite remarkable .    in figure [ cglfig : grholin ]",
    "we present the results for @xmath156 with @xmath170 in both the @xmath275 and @xmath276 directions . for both directions",
    "the typical nearest neighbor is of the opposite sign : the charges are thus screened .",
    "similar behavior for vortices in random wave fields has been observed @xcite . in figure",
    "[ cglfig : grholinlog ] we show a linear  log plot of @xmath277 . in figure",
    "[ cglfig : grhologlog ] we show log  log plots of @xmath277 .",
    "we also show lines that represent the slope @xmath277 should have if it decayed like @xmath278 .",
    "we note that at the right edge of the figure , we have reached the point where our data is dominated by statistical noise .",
    "it is clear that neither direction shows the expected @xmath278 decay .",
    "our results are at variance with the predictions of generic scale invariance , as they must be .",
    "as was shown in the last section , the theory is not applicable to systems which have strong constraints placed on them due to the topological nature of the order parameter .",
    "the suggestion has been made @xcite that in order to see the @xmath278 decay the system needs to break @xmath279 symmetry .",
    "we systematically tested this idea by adding various terms to the original equation ( [ cgleqn : cgl ] ) .",

    "the results are similar to the ones seen in figure [ cglfig : grhologlog ] for the results of the original equation .",
    "note that the term we have added here actually only induces a drift in the entire pattern , and can be scaled away , so it is not surprising that it does not show behavior that differs from the original equation .",

    "the result for @xmath281 is shown in figure [ cglfig : grhologlog3 ] .",
    "this term also breaks the @xmath279 symmetry .",
    "however , a term of this form is expected to show , according to the ideas of generic scale invariance @xcite , a decay that is actually faster than @xmath278 , so our results are not very informative .",
    "we can not distinguish between power laws of @xmath283 and our results , so we must proceed to add a different term to the original equation .",
    "the third new term we added both breaks the @xmath279 symmetry and _ is _ expected to show a @xmath278 decay , according to the predictions of generic scale invariance .",
    "this term is @xmath284 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath281 are shown in figure [ cglfig : grhologlog5 ] .",
    "we see from this that the correlation function does not decay like @xmath278 .",
    "this is not surprising in the light of our results from section [ cglsec : constraints ] , which apply to any two  dimensional topological defect in a complex field .    finally , we experimented with breaking the @xmath285 symmetry in the original equation by adding the term @xmath286 to the original equation .",
    "the results for @xmath281 are given in figure [ cglfig : grhologlog4 ] .",
    "these results no longer shows the strong anisotropy seen in the correlation function of the original unmodified equation . with the broken symmetry ,",
    "the decay of the correlation function in the @xmath276 direction occurs smoothly to zero from the negative values near @xmath287 without crossing zero .",
    "we have also constructed a coarse  grained order parameter field by defining @xmath288 where @xmath289 is a coarse  graining weight function with @xmath290 .",

    "we can also calculate @xmath292 .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ cglfig : coarsecorr ] .",
