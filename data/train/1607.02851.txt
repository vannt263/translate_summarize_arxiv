    "a surface facing a plasma collects electrons from the plasma more efficiently than it looses electrons due to neutralization of ions and/or de - excitation of radicals .",
    "it acquires thus a negative charge triggering in turn an electron - depletion layer in front of it  the plasma sheath  shielding the plasma from the surface .",
    "although known since the beginning of modern plasma physics  @xcite a quantitative understanding of electron accumulation by plasma walls is still lacking  @xcite .",
    "this is only due partly to unresolved materials science aspects , such as , chemical contamination and/or mechanical destruction of the surface by the plasma .",
    "it is also because little is known fundamentally about the interaction of electrons with surfaces at the energies relevant for plasma applications .",
    "electrons interacting with solid surfaces in the divertor region of fusion plasmas  @xcite , dielectric barrier discharges  @xcite , dusty plasmas  @xcite , hall thrusters  @xcite , or electric probe measurements  @xcite have typically energies below 10ev , much less than the electron energy used in surface analysis  @xcite or materials processing  @xcite .",
    "the energies there are a few 100ev , an energy range , where the physical processes involved , backscattering and secondary electron emission , are sufficiently well understood  @xcite to make these techniques reliable tools of applied science . much less is however known about these processes below 100ev and hence in the energy range relevant for plasmas . in particular , the backscattering probability of a low - energy electron , and closely related to it , the probability with which it is absorbed is basically unknown .",
    "although electron absorption ( sticking ) and backscattering are important processes for bounded plasmas there is no systematic effort to determine their probabilities either experimentally or theoretically .",
    "the electron sticking probability , for instance , is usually assumed to be close to unity  @xcite , irrespective of the energy and angle of incident or the wall material ( perfect absorber assumption  @xcite ) .",
    "the need to overcome this assumption has been strongly emphasized by mendis  @xcite but the model calculations he refers to are based on classical considerations not applicable to electrons .    in a recent work  @xcite we proposed therefore a quantum - mechanical approach for calculating the electron sticking probability .",
    "the method is based on two important facts noticed by cazaux  @xcite : ( i ) low - energy electrons do not see the strongly varying short - range potentials of the surface s ion cores but a slowly varying surface potential and ( ii ) they penetrate deeply into the surface . for al@xmath0o@xmath1 , for instance , the average electron penetration depth at a few ev is around 200  @xcite .",
    "the sticking probability for an electron approaching the wall of a plasma can thus be expressed by the transmission probability for the long - ranged surface potential times the probability to remain inside the wall despite of internal backscattering .",
    "essential for our approach is the invariant embedding principle  @xcite .",
    "it allows us to extract from the overwhelming number of electron trajectories the few backwardly directed ones most relevant for sticking .",
    "so far we applied the method to mgo  @xcite obtaining excellent agreement with electron - beam scattering data  @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider sio@xmath0  finding again good agreement with beam data  @xcite . in both cases",
    "the sticking probability is energy- and angle - dependent as well as significantly less than unity .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we describe our microscopic approach for calculating electron absorption and backscattering probabilities in more detail than previously  @xcite , focusing in particular on the invariant embedding principle and its linearization making the approach numerically very efficient .",

    "contrary to the perfect absorber assumption , @xmath172 , we find energy- and angle - dependent sticking probabilities which can deviate significantly from unity because of internal backscattering due to emission of optical phonons and total reflection due to electron mass mismatch and conservation of total energy and lateral momentum .",
