    "however , there is little controversy about the basic features and the correction terms to be used . in particular , relativistic spin corrections as derived in @xcite and rescattering contributions @xcite are used in the most recent analyses @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "moreover , the role of coulomb corrections in @xmath5 @xcite and exchange currents in the @xmath6 cross section have been discussed @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical problems left are presumably related to shortcomings in principle of the potential model description .",
    "for example , lorentz invariance can only be accounted for approximately by a covariant treatment of the kinematic transformations , inclusion of higher order terms in @xmath7 in the electromagnetic operator ( relativistic spin corrections ) and an appropriate description of the nn ",
    "further common features of existing potential model calculations are the absence of dynamical baryon resonances and the neglect of two  body currents beyond the @xmath8 terms given by the soft photon approximation ( spa ) .",

    "the maximum net effect of both contributions can increase the differential cross section by @xmath131 at medium photon angles but amounts to only a few percent in the total cross section .    among the examples of fig .",
    "2 , only the 12.4@xmath132 , 14@xmath132 analyzing power shows a sizeable dependence on the parametrization of the @xmath24 and @xmath15exchange .",
    "the choice of different electromagnetic couplings , e.  g.  @xmath48 , @xmath49 , increases the @xmath1contribution in the cross sections by about 20 @xmath125 which translates to an enhancement of the complete @xmath5 cross section by about 5 @xmath125 at maximum ( figure 3 ) .",
    "conversely , the choice of @xmath133 @xcite reduces the size of the @xmath1contributions by roughly @xmath134 .",
    "these two choices for the couplings and off  shell parameters are likely to be rather extreme .",
    "moreover , because of its small relative size , a rescaling error in the @xmath121amplitude would not affect much the end results .",
    "one might therefore conclude that the corrections are reasonably well determined in our model .    in order to obtain a more general picture",
    "we calculate the double differential cross section @xmath135 and represent its relative enhancement due to the correction terms as a function of the symmetric angle @xmath136 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "note that small @xmath137 values correspond to a suppression of the meson four momentum transfer ( @xmath138 ) whereas for large @xmath137 , the elastic limit @xmath139 is reached . in both cases , the amplitudes ( [ deltamp ] ) and ( [ radamp ] )",
    "are suppressed : they are maximum in the medium proton angle region @xmath140 .",
    "the relative size of the corrections dies down as the energy decreases and reaches only about 3@xmath125 at @xmath141 mev .    in figure 5 the analysis of fig .",
    "2 is repeated for the @xmath6observables . here ,",
    "the isospin factors yield strong destructive interference between the various feynman graphs so that both the @xmath1 excitation and the radiative decays become negligible corrections to the potential model cross section .",
    "the same result holds for the @xmath6analyzing power .",

    "two typical geometries of the 730 mev @xmath5experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig 5 .",
    "one proton is emitted at @xmath142 and the polar angles of the photon are @xmath143 for counter g7 and @xmath144 for counter g10 .",
    "the solid curves have been obtained with the soft photon approximation of @xcite .",
    "contributions in @xmath0 are only partly included in spa ; the corrections considered here are thus specific candidates for the missing @xmath0 effects .",
    "as expected the corrections are negligible for small @xmath145 but increase with the photon energy .",
    "analogous to the 280 mev examples , there is cancellation between the @xmath1 and @xmath121effects .",
    "the actual size is again geometry dependent but is limited to about 20@xmath125 of the spa cross section at @xmath146 mev .",
    "a variation of the electromagnetic coupling constants and off  shell parameters within the experimental limits yields effects analogous to those shown in fig .",
    "3 and leaves a freedom of a few percent in our final @xmath146 mev results .",
    "correspondingly , the results are not much altered by interchange of model a and b. we conclude that a @xmath1amplitude consistent with experimental results can only resolve a small part of the discrepancy between the spa and the 730 mev @xmath5results at photon energies above @xmath147 100 mev .",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath1excitation and radiative @xmath121decay corrections to proton  proton and neutron  proton bremsstrahlung for the energy range up to @xmath148 gev .",
    "this was done by calculating the relativistic born amplitudes and adding them to potential model and spa amplitudes .",
    "the born amplitudes were normalized by calculating @xmath1production and absorption cross sections in the same model and fitting to experimental data and coupled channel predictions .",
    "of the two processes considered , the @xmath1excitation dominates but is generally partly compensated by the radiative decay contributions .",
    "both corrections together increase the 280 mev @xmath5 integrated cross section @xmath149 by an amount depending essentially on the proton opening angles @xmath150 and reaching a maximum of roughly 7.5@xmath125 at @xmath151 .",
    "the relative effect on @xmath152 is maximum for photon emission around @xmath153 and is typically @xmath154 .    in the 730 mev rochester geometry ,",
    "the corrections become relevant for photon energies above @xmath147 100 mev but are not big enough to complement the soft photon approximation and fit the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we have taken care to study and discuss the limits and uncertainties of our model .",
    "the results have been obtained on the basis of two different parametrizations of the @xmath1excitation ( model a and b of table 1 ) but show little sensitivity to the underlying coupled  channel model .",
    "the fact that the @xmath1excitation cross sections of model a and b are nearly identical , despite the rather massive differences in the values of the @xmath15couplings and the choice of form factors and propagators , is reassuring for our approach but corresponds to the result obtained earlier that rather different potential models , once they fit the nn  scattering data ,",
    "yield very similar bremsstrahlung results @xcite and is disappointing if one hopes to understand the underlying physical reaction mechanism from @xmath3 measurements .",
    "the experimental uncertainty in the radiative @xmath1decay constants and the off  shell freedom of the @xmath1 suggest a theoretical error of about @xmath155 in the final correction amplitudes , i.  e.up to @xmath156 in the total ( 280 mev ) @xmath5 cross section .",
    "we should mention that the discrepancies between the @xmath5 predictions of different nn  potential models , which most bremsstrahlung experiments in the past were designed to isolate , are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "given the present experimental status of nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung and the theoretical ambiguities mentioned , it is not possible to use @xmath3data for putting limits on the parameters entering our correction amplitudes .    in view of the similarities of our calculation with previous ansatzes ,",
    "a comprehensive comparison of the results seems worthwhile .",
    "first note that we have eliminated the uncertainty with respect to the relative sign of the relativistic corrections stated by kamal and szyjewicz @xcite through a comparison with the pion  photoproduction process .",
    "our @xmath121decay amplitude extends the amplitude of @xcite by including the @xmath14tensor coupling terms and the @xmath15decays and is , if we divide by @xmath113 , slightly smaller than given there .",
    "the discrepancy of our result is more serious for the 730 mev @xmath1excitation calculation where the previous authors lack a reliable model for the nn ",
    "channel @xmath5amplitude .",
    "the authors of @xcite therefore essentially fit the @xmath1excitation part to the experimental @xmath5 data . in @xcite ,",
    "the suppression of the amplitude which we simulate by appropriate form factors is neglected . in both cases , the pure @xmath1cross section becomes bigger than ours by more than a factor of 10 and would be in clear contradiction to the 800 mev @xmath1production data of , e.  g.@xcite .",
    "we also stress the importance of taking interference terms correctly into account .    the dispersion theoretic approach used in @xcite to estimate",
    "the role of the @xmath1resonance in a ope@xmath6 calculation is rather different from our model .",
