    "previous investigations of several ring galaxies have shown that a considerable part of their stellar population was born at the preset epoch as a result of the density wave passing .",
    "hence , most of the stellar population in such objects emerges within a few , or even one event of star formation . since the wave triggering the star formation propagates inside out",
    ", we can see stars with different ages at different locations . unlike the regular spiral galaxies where stars of different ages are well mixed , the sites of different ages are separated in space in the ring galaxies .",
    "this fact makes collisional ring galaxies an excellent laboratory for study the star formation history and general properties of star formation . in this paper",
    "we use two long - slit spectra to constrain models of star formation in a collisional ring galaxy arp 10 .",
    "an old stellar exponential disk lies in the background . its surface brightness and scalelength",
    "are parameters of the model which were obtained from our surface photometry data .",
    "the bulge is also taken into account .",
    "the young stellar population emerges in the exponential gaseous disk after triggering of star formation by outwardly propagating ring density waves .",
    "we consider two waves with different speeds which correspond to the external and internal rings in arp 10 .",
    "metallicity of young population in the external ring is tied to the observed values ( see @xcite ) , but the radial metallicity gradient is variable in our models .",
    "metallicity of stellar population in the center of the old disk and its gradient are the model parameters .",
    "the metallicities , surface densities , and ages of the stellar populations are used to find the corresponding spectral indices by interpolation on a grid of indices .",
    "the grid was computed for a variety of metallicities and ages , and is obtained from synthetic spectra produced with the starburst 99 population synthesis code @xcite .",
    "we got high - res spectra ( resolution 0.3a ) from starburst 99 and convolved them with the instrumental profile of our observed spectra ( resolution 5 - 8 a ) .",
    "then the spectral indices were defined exactly as in @xcite and found for all synthetic spectra ( thus we got the quasi - lick indices ) .",
    "two long - slit spectra for arp 10 were taken with the 6-m telescope ( special astrophysical observatory , russian academy of sciences ) and the scorpio multi - mode spectrograph @xcite .",
    "spectral indices , as defined by @xcite , and their uncertainties were obtained from the long - slit spectra at different radii .",
    "se and nw parts of the long slit spectra were analyzed separately .",
    "we incorporate selected indices to get one common chi - square for them .",
    "the powell optimization algorithm was applied to minimize this chi - square value .",
    "the models which take into account only one kind of stellar population ( either young or old ) can not explain the radial distributions of spectral indices .",
    "\\2 . using spectral indices which correspond to the fe - peak elements , we got pretty similar best - fit values for the model parameters with both our long - slit spectra , see fig 3 and 4 .",
    "the mean values of the wave propagation speed in the region of the outer ring is 35 km / s .",
    "the inner ring best - fit speed , 30 km / s , is very close to the above value .",
    "it corresponds to the ages of the outer and inner rings of 450 and 100 myr , respectively .",
    "the best - fit central metallicity [ fe / h ] for the old population is -0.3 dex and its gradient is -0.09 dex / kpc .",
    "the gradient of metallicity of young population is about -0.05 dex / kpc . in comparison to the se parts of our long - slit spectra , the nw parts give rather similar best - fit model parameters with a smaller value for the outer ring speed .",
    "the results shown above reveal two major recent events of propagating star formation in arp 10 induced by the passing of a satellite - intruder ( the satellite was unambiguously identified in @xcite ) ."
