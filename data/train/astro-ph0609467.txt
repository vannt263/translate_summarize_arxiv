    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) and symbiotic nebulae are the visible remains of a heavy mass loss period near the end of the lives of most low and intermediate mass stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "a fraction of pne is bipolar ( bpne ) and this morphology is likely caused by having a binary for central star ( @xcite ) .",
    "bpne have special properties ( @xcite ) and are important objects for the study of outflows , mass loss , and binarity in pne several meetings have been dedicated to asymmetrical pne ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , see references herein .    the orientation angle on the plane of the sky of asymmetrical pne has been studied more than 30 years ago by @xcite and more recently by @xcite who both found an apparent alignment of the long axes of pne with the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the paper by @xcite based on a larger sample and using more rigorous statistical methods showed that there is no significant alignment and that pne are essentially randomly distributed on the sky . assuming that this random distribution also holds for the inclination with respect to the line of sight where the inclination , i , is taken to be 0@xmath0 for a pole - on nebula and 90@xmath0 for an object viewed with its main axis parallel to the plane of the sky  we investigate the possible effects of orientation on the observational properties pne .",
    "@xcite studied the observational orientation effects in six bipolar proto - pne and found that objects are redder when viewed edge - on i.e. have the inclination angle i near 90@xmath0 , as expected from simple geometrical extinction considerations nd assuming some equatorial density enhancement . from these data they concluded that proto - pne generally have bipolar shapes and asymmetrical dust disks .    here",
    "we present a more general look at the phenomenon and apply a simple model to a larger sample of objects that we know to be bipolar , to see if we observe differences as a function of inclination angle .",
    "we study a range of overall geometries and dust properties of the equatorial tori , different black - body temperature ratios between the dust and central stars , and simulate observational data sets by letting these model parameters vary randomly over a restricted and physically meaningful range .",
    "these data sets we then compare directly with our observed results .",
    "we have collected a sample of 29 bipolar planetary nebulae and symbiotic nebulae that had sufficient data available in the literature to construct a reasonable spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , with at least some data points in the optical , near - ir , and mid - ir wavelength ranges .",
    "table1 lists our sample of objects and their calculated relative luminosities in each of the three bands that we defined as follows .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the first and most obvious result is that a sharply changing density distribution can not reproduce the observed behavior of the luminosity with inclination angle .",
    "the only models that agree well with the observations have the smoothly varying structure of the last row of figure3",
    ". we will continue calling this distribution a `` disk '' .",
    "the 2-d model copes well with double central stars . by using a hot , compact star with a cooler giant - like companion ,",
    "we get good agreement with the observations .",
    "since we only have a relatively small sample of random systems the spread in our plots is rather large and a precise and detailed model can not be selected on this basis .",
    "we do , however , confirm that the observed behavior as a function of inclination angle is easily reproducible with simple and physically meaningful and plausible models of bipolar nebulae ."
