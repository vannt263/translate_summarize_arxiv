    "there has been a steady progression of lattice results from a quenched sea to a two - flavour and more recently @xmath0 flavour sea in an attempt to provide a more complete and quantitative description of hadronic phenomena .",
    "( by @xmath0 flavours we mean here two mass degenerate up - down , @xmath1 , quarks and one strange , @xmath2 , quark . ) in this letter we discuss some ways of approaching in the @xmath1@xmath2 plane the physical point @xmath3 , where the natural starting point for these paths is an @xmath4 flavour symmetric point @xmath5 .",
    "( the superscripts @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote the physical point and flavour symmetric point respectively and @xmath8 means the renormalised quantity . )",
    "the usual procedure is to estimate the physical strange quark mass and then try to keep it fixed , i.e.  @xmath9 , as the light quark mass is reduced to its physical value .",
    "however the problem is that the kaon mass is always larger than its physical value .",
    "we propose here instead to choose the path such that the singlet quark mass is kept fixed , @xmath10 this procedure has the advantage that we can vary both quark masses over a wide range , and is thus particularly useful for strange quark physics .",
    "@xmath11 chiral perturbation theory should work well , because both the kaon and @xmath12 are lighter than their physical values along the entire trajectory .",
    "( they both approach their final mass values from below . ) since @xmath11 chiral perturbation theory is thought to be valid for @xmath13 , @xcite , we should always be able to make use of chiral perturbation theory . if we extend our measurements beyond the symmetric point we can also investigate a world with heavy up - down quarks and a lighter strange quark .    as a ` proof of concept ' results given here show firstly the correct order for the baryon octet and decuplet mass spectrum and secondly an extrapolation to the physical pion mass yields results to within a few percent for the baryon masses .",
    "flavour singlet quantities are flat at a point on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line and hence allow simpler extrapolations to the physical point .",
    "this may be shown by considering small changes about a point on the flavour symmetric line .",
    "let @xmath14 be a flavour singlet object i.e.  @xmath15 is invariant under the quark permutation symmetry between @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "so taylor expanding @xmath15 about a point on the symmetric line where flavour @xmath4 holds gives @xmath19 but on the symmetric line we have @xmath20 and on our chosen trajectory @xmath21 , @xmath22 which together imply that @xmath23 in other words , the effect at first order of changing the strange quark mass is cancelled by the change in the light quark mass , so we know that @xmath15 must have a stationary point on the @xmath11 symmetric line .",
    "if we were making a quadratic extrapolation to the physical point , this eliminates a free parameter ",
    "we only need two parameters to make the quadratic extrapolation .",
    "this is particularly useful for quantities like the force scale , @xmath24 , where we do not have any theoretical input from chiral perturbation theory .",
    "also the fact that @xmath15 is flat at the symmetric point means that the extrapolated value can not lie very far from the measured value .",
    "other paths are not so fortunate .",
    "what we are doing is to keep the flavour singlet part of the quark matrix constant , while increasing the octet part ( the changes in quark masses are proportional to @xmath25 ) .",
    "gluons are flavour - blind , they can not couple directly to a flavour octet operator , they can only see flavour singlets  which can only occur in the square of the octet part of the mass .",
    "so everything about our gluon configuration will vary quadratically with the distance from the symmetric point .",
    "so we are generating all our configurations closer to the physical point by taking the @xmath21 line .",
    "other potential advantages include : as @xmath26 then @xmath27 , i.e.  , the @xmath28@xmath29 splitting or @xmath30 increases to its physical value .",
    "the singlet quark mass is correct from the very beginning ; numerically the simulation cost change should be moderate and the update algorithm is expected to equilibrate quickly along this path .    for @xmath15",
    "we have several possibilities : for example the centre of mass squared of the meson octet , @xmath31 or the centre of mass of the baryon octet or decuplet , @xmath32 , @xmath33 respectively or a gluonic quantity such as @xmath34 .",
    "we can check the above result , eq .  ( [ xs_expansion ] ) , by considering leading order ( lo ) together with next to leading order ( nlo ) @xmath11 chiral perturbation theory , @xmath35pt . note that lo @xmath35pt corresponds to linear terms in the expansion of @xmath15 and so from eq .",
    "( [ xs_expansion ] ) will be absent . rather than using the full symmetric @xmath36 results it is sufficient to just consider the @xmath0 results .",
    "let us first define @xmath37 and furthermore set @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "then @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants on our trajectory and so @xmath42 this means that any functions of the form @xmath43 will have zero derivative at the symmetric point , so they are permitted as higher order corrections .",
    "using the lo and nlo results from e.g.  @xcite ( where further details of the functions can be found ) we have @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath12 are combinations of the low energy constants . the nlo results are shown in curly brackets .",
    "these results are thus all in agreement with our previous discussion .",
    "note also that on the @xmath21 trajectory some of the low energy constants combine together leading to fits with fewer free parameters .",
    "we now have to relate the known physical point to the initial symmetric point .",
    "as discussed above , we expect @xmath15 to be constant ( in @xmath1 ) up to small corrections , so we will find it sufficient to consider only lo @xmath35pt . then keeping @xmath51 constant means keeping @xmath52 constant . for this path choice , we can now relate the known physical point to the initial symmetric point , @xmath53 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "so simulations along the flavour symmetric line and using eq .",
    "( [ physical_point ] ) are sufficient to determine the initial point .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ b5p50_mps2ox2_2mpsk2-mps2ox2 ] in the next section .    if we now generalise to consider higher order terms from the above discussion lines of constant @xmath15 are curved though they do still have to have the slope of @xmath55 at the point where they cross the @xmath56 line .",
    "now we have to specify more closely what we mean when we keep @xmath57 constant , as different scale choices give different paths . as shown above in eq .",
    "( [ xs_expansion ] ) on our trajectory this is a higher order effect , on other choices of trajectory the difference between different scale definitions would be much more important . if we make different choices of the quantity we keep constant at the experimentally measured physical value , for example the choices discussed above we get slightly different trajectories .",
    "the different trajectories begin at slightly different points along the symmetric line .",
    "initially they are all parallel with slope @xmath55 , but away from the symmetry line they can curve , and will all meet at the physical point .",
    "the above properties are general ; we now apply them to ` clover ' or @xmath58-improved wilson fermions .",
    "there are now some additional points to consider when relating the bare quark mass ( which is the input parameter ) to the renormalised quark mass .",
    "the problem is that for fermions with no chiral symmetry the singlet , s , and non - singlet , ns , quark mass can renormalise differently which means that the relation to the bare quark masses and hence @xmath59 , which is the adjustable simulation parameter , is more complicated @xcite @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath18 ) with @xmath62 and bare quark mass defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is defined by the vanishing of the quark mass along the symmetric line , i.e.  for @xmath65 mass degenerate flavours .",
    "now from lo @xmath35pt we have @xmath66 and so the path @xmath67 remains as @xmath68 constant .",
    "this translates to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the appropriate @xmath59 on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line .",
    "as discussed previously higher order corrections have zero derivative at the flavour @xmath4 symmetric point and so should be small .",
    "@xmath58-improvement also leads to a change in the coupling constant , @xmath71 , @xcite .",
    "however for our trajectory as @xmath72 is held constant then @xmath73 also remains constant . also , @xcite , @xmath74 \\overline{m}$ ] where @xmath75 , @xmath76 are improvement coefficients and @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "as @xmath79 has a minimum at @xmath80 , it is again flat at the symmetry point , as expected .",
    "we have estimated that with the parameters used below , the correction term in @xmath81 remains very small and so we shall ignore this here .",
    "the particular clover action used here consists of the tree level symanzik improved gluon action together with a mild ` stout ' smeared fermion action .",
    "further details , @xcite , and a determination of the non - perturbative , np , coefficient used for the clover term are described in @xcite .",
    "simulations have been performed using the hybrid monte carlo , hmc , algorithm with mass preconditioning for @xmath82 mass - degenerate flavours and the rational hmc , @xcite for the @xmath83-flavour .",
    "two programmes were used , a fortran programme , @xcite , and also the chroma programme , @xcite .",
    "all the runs described here are on @xmath84 lattices at @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xcite ( we describe the determination of the scale later ) .",
    "we first need to determine the symmetric point , using eq .",
    "( [ physical_point ] ) .",
    "a series of runs on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line gives an estimate of our starting value @xmath70 .",
    "some are shown in fig .",
    "[ b5p50_mps2ox2_2mpsk2-mps2ox2 ]    = 12.00 cm    ( where we plot @xmath87 against @xmath88 using the scales @xmath15 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath54 ) as the points lying on the @xmath89 , black dashed line .",
    "we seek the point on the symmetric line where eq .",
    "( [ physical_point ] ) holds .",
    "this gives an estimate for @xmath70 .",
    "we find @xmath90 which we shall take as our starting value .",
    "from this we can now , given a @xmath91 , find the corresponding @xmath92 using eq .",
    "( [ kappas_given_kappal ] ) . after some experimentation we chose the @xmath91 , @xmath92 values given in table  [ kappa_values ] .",
    ".@xmath93 values simulated on @xmath84 lattices .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results are already within a few percent of their experimental values , and clearly show that higher orders of @xmath35pt are small",
    ". we can expect an improvement for results closer to the physical pion mass .    finally to illustrate better the ` fanning ' out of the results we show in fig .",
    "[ b5p50_mps2omnopmsigopmxioo32-sym_mnommsigoomnopmsigopmxioo3_split - jnt ]    = 12.00 cm    mass splittings for the baryon octet : @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 together with the constrained fit from eq .",
    "( [ octet_fit ] ) . considering mass splittings has the advantage that the results can be obtained directly from the ratio of correlation functions , which leads to a significant reduction in the error .",
    "we have suggested here that the simplest way of approaching the physical point in lattice simulations is to hold the singlet quark mass fixed from a point on the @xmath4 flavour symmetric line .",
    "this has been shown both theoretically and numerically ( using an np @xmath58-improved @xmath0 flavour clover action ) to lead to very smooth results in the extrapolation of singlet quantities to the physical pion mass .",
    "exploratory results for the hadron mass spectrum give masses in the correct order ( including _ inversion _ when @xmath97 i.e.  we can simulate a strange world where , for example , the nucleon can decay ) .",
    "furthermore the extrapolated masses for both the baryon octet and decuplet are within a few percent of their experimental values .",
    "to improve the situation further clearly we need simulations closer to the physical pion mass . at present in our simulations",
    "the pion mass decreases from @xmath98 to @xmath99 while the kaon mass increases from @xmath100 to @xmath98 , ( experimentally @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) . also to improve the accuracy of the approach to the physical pion mass another line of constant singlet mass",
    "should be found , which will allow interpolation / extrapolation around the physical pion mass .",
    "finally we note that even lo @xmath35pt seems to be working very well around the flavour symmetric point .",
    "further results will be published elsewhere , @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed on the ibm bluegenel at epcc ( edinburgh , uk ) , the bluegenel and p at nic ( jlich , germany ) , the sgi ice 8200 at hlrn ( berlin - hannover , germany ) and the jscc ( moscow , russia ) .",
