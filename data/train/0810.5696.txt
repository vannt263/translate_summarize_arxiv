    "in just over 5 years , the ibis instrument on board the integral gamma - ray satellite has revolutionised our classical view of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) . specifically , ibis has discovered many new hmxbs hosting massive ob supergiant stars ( the so - called supergiant high mass x - ray binaries , sgxb ) ; in just a few years their population has been almost tripled thanks to the ibis identification of two previously unrecognized subclasses of sgxbs : the highly obscured sgxbs @xcite and the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ; @xcite , @xcite ) .    around 9 sfxts are known to date .",
    "they spend most of the time in a low level of x - ray activity characterized by x - ray luminosity values in the range 10@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , well below the persistent bright state of other classical sgxbs ( @xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 ) . only occasionally do they display bright and fast x - ray outbursts with a duration no longer than a few days ( typically only a few hours ) and a dynamical range in flux of 10@xmath710@xmath8 .",
    "a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the peculiar flaring behaviour of sfxts , both as a class of objects on their own , and in the context of persistently accreting supergiant x - ray binaries .",
    "some of the models proposed invoke structure in the wind of the supergiant companion .",
    "this structure could be either in the form of clumping of spherically symmetric outflow from the supergiant donor , or in the form of an equatorially density enhanced wind from the supergiant , inclined at some angle to the orbit of the neutron star .",
    "futhermore , variations in the orbital eccentricity @xcite can be used to explain the difference between supergiant x - ray binary systems showing transient as opposed to persistent x - ray emission .",
    "a different model proposed by @xcite makes use of transitions between accretion gating mechanisms , such as centrifugal and magnetic barriers , brought about by variations in the stellar wind , to explain the large dynamic range in flux observed in these systems .",
    "fast outbursts from sfxts are relatively rare occurances ( i.e. a few are detected per year ) , and long periods of inactivity are interspersed here and there with short flares spaced by irregular intervals of time . because of this , the identification of periodicity is a very challenging task which can be fullfilled only through long - term and continous monitoring . to date , while recurrent ( but non - periodic ) outbursts have been observed in many sfxts , only one , igr j11215@xmath05952 has been shown to exhibit periodic flaring activity separated by regular intervals of @xmath5 165 days .",
    "the identification of periodicity in the outburst behaviour of sfxts , most likely represents the orbital period of the binary system , and is a key diagnostic for studying the geometry of the system ( i.e. orbital radius , eccentricity ) and hence for understanding the physical reasons behind their very unusual x - ray behaviour . in this letter",
    "we report a comprehensive temporal study of the sfxt sax j1818.6@xmath01703 , leading to the discovery of a @xmath5 30 day periodicity , making this the second confirmed periodic sfxt .",
    "sax j1818.6@xmath01703 was reported for the first time by bepposax / wfc on march 11 , 1998 during one of the galactic bulge observation campaigns @xcite .",
    "the peak flux was @xmath5400 mcrab ( 9 - 25 kev ) and the outburst lasted for 0.1 days and was characterised by a fast decay .    on september 9 , 2003 ,",
    "the ibis telescope on integral detected 2 short and intense outbursts with fluxes reaching 400 mcrab in the 18 - 45 kev energy band .",
    "this source activity was reported by @xcite as showing a complex time profile lasting for about 1 day , while the main event duration was 2.7 hours .",
    "spectra at different evolutionary phases extending up to @xmath5100 kev were fitted with thermal bremsstrahlung models .",
    "the nature of the source was still unclear but rxte and integral data exhibiting such outbursts were considered indicative of a possible sfxt @xcite , a picture later strengthened by @xcite on the basis of an optical / nir counterpart with an i - band spectrum typical of an ob supergiant .",
    "this result was confirmed soon afterwards by @xcite , with a chandra observation revealing only one bright and variable source within the error region of sax j1818.6@xmath01703 , and 0.21  and 0.47  from the 2mass and usno - b1.0 positions of the proposed counterpart .",
    "the authors reported a strongly absorbed ( @xmath9 ) power law spectrum with a photon index of 1.9 and a 0.5 - 10 kev flux of @xmath10 and also suggested the source may not be a true transient but a persistent hmxb with luminous flares such as 4u 1907 + 097 or vela x-1 . confirmed the ob supergiant nature of the counterpart and inferred a distance of 2.5kpc .",
    "the source was not detected by xmm during a 13 ks observation on october 8 , 2006 .",
    "following the new report of activity by @xcite , a swift too was activated on april 18 , 2008 and the flux value recorded was consistent with the chandra observation , while the xmm upper limit is a factor of 80 below these detections . with these new findings",
    ", @xcite concluded that sax j1818.6@xmath01703 shows an x - ray flux dynamic range similar to that observed for other sfxts .",
    "ibis / isgri data is organised and analysed in short pointings ( science windows , scw ) of typically 2000s duration .",
    "we analysed ibis / isgri data for all available science windows covering the date range from march 12 , 2003 to march 12 , 2008 ( mjd range 52710 - 54537 ) in the 18 - 60 kev energy band using the standard osa 7 analysis tools to provide intensity and significance images for each science window .",
    "we excluded data flagged as taken during bad time intervals , and additionally removed science windows with high image rms .",
    "thereafter , we extracted fluxes from each science window at the position of sax j1818.6@xmath01703 to create a light curve at science window resolution . for periodicity analysis , science windows where sax j1818.6@xmath01703 was more than 12 degrees off - axis",
    "were excluded to avoid any effects due to incomplete off - axis response correction .",
    "after filters were applied , the ibis dataset consisted of 3756 scw for a total effective exposure of 6.1 ms .",
    "the swift / bat 15 - 50 kev light curve for sax j1818.6@xmath01703 was obtained from the bat transient monitor programme @xcite , and covered the date range from may 10 , 2005 to august 23 , 2008 ( mjd range 53500 - 54705 ) .",
    "data were filtered to include only pointings with data quality flag 0 ( good quality ) . after filtering , 10975 individual pointings with a total effective exposure of 5.6 ms",
    "were retained .",
    "a standard test for periodicity was carried out using the lomb - scargle method on the ibis combined light curves in the 18 - 60 kev band .",
    "an indication of periodic signal at around 30 days was found , but with a significant degree of aliasing and a strong first harmonic ( figure  [ fig : ls ] , upper panel ) .    ]",
    "some aliasing is not unusual in ibis light curves , because of the window function imposed by the approximately 6-monthly observation pattern for sources near the galactic bulge .",
    "furthermore , significant leakage of power into the harmonic is usually considered an indicator of non - sinusoidal modulation , which the lomb - scargle algorithm must compensate for by the addition of higher frequency components . to provide an independent verification of the suspected periodicity , the same analysis was performed on the swift / bat 15 - 50 kev light curve ( figure  [ fig : ls ] , lower panel ) . in this case",
    ", the aliasing is much reduced due to the more even temporal coverage provided by the large bat field of view , but the power of the periodicity is substantially reduced due to the lower sensitivity per pointing compared to ibis / isgri .",
    "nevertheless , the periodicity at @xmath530 days is still detected at above 99.9% significance in both light curves .    in order to investigate further ,",
    "the detected periodicity was verified by the use of an epoch - folding method on the ibis / isgri light curve , this method being less dependent on the periodic flux profile .",
    "this search again resulted in a clear maximum at around 30 days ( figure  [ fig : efsearch ] ) .",
    "fitting the peak yields an estimate of both the period and its associated error , specifically @xmath11 ( 1@xmath12 ) days .    ]",
    "the ibis light curve folded on the 30 day period ( figure  [ fig : folded ] ) shows a very significant modulation , and also shows that the source has a duty cycle of around 4 - 6 days during each 30 day period .",
    "simulations performed on data with the same duty cycle verified that the strong harmonics observed in the lomb - scargle analysis are due to this profile .    in order to ensure that the large outburst at around mjd 52891 was not dominating the overall folded light curve , the analysis was repeated removing the largest outburst ( specifically data for mjds 52889 - 52893 ) . figure  [ fig : folded ] also shows the folded ibis light curve with the outburst removed , and there is no substantial difference in shape with or without the large outburst .",
    "indeed , the ibis light curve analysed represents some 70 cycles of the @xmath530d period , and should be relatively robust against any such dominance by a single outburst .",
    "furthermore , the analysis in section [ section : recurrence ] shows that sax j1818.6@xmath01703 has a high degree of recurrence , indicating that this folded light curve should be a reasonable representation of the average outburst .    .",
    "knowledge of the period and phasing of the known outbursts is of great benefit when examining the light curves for events of lower significance .",
    "a search was carried out for other outbursts with similar characteristics to the known ones in both the ibis and bat light curves .",
    "a significance was determined for a 4-day period around each of the expected outburst times where sufficient data were available .",
    "table  [ table : newbursts ] reports detections above 7 sigma in either instrument , and the corresponding significance in the other instrument lightcurve .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of the x - ray observations carried out to date are consistent with this orbital period , and for reference the phase ( arbitrarily referenced to the bat trigger at mjd 54540.659 ) of the various x - ray observations are indicated in figure  [ fig : folded ] .",
    "it can be seen that the xmm observation , which reported a firm upper limit on the flux , occurred at a phase of 0.51 , i.e. apastron .",
    "thus this measurement can be interpreted as setting an upper limit on the quiescent flux from the system . by contrast , the chandra observation was performed at phase 0.89 , and the reported monotonic rising flux appears to show the onset of emission , but whether this is a slow increase as the compact object approached periastron , or the onset of an outburst , we can not say .",
    "the xrt observation was performed at a phase of 0.11 and indicates some low - level activity , compatible with the chandra flux , and an order of magnitude above the xmm upper limit .",
    "we performed a similar analysis using the rxte / asm light curve .",
    "unfortunately , while we can conclude that rxte / asm is detecting x - ray emission from the source , it does not provide any further diagnostic information due to its limited instantaneous sensitivity to a source that is only rarely above 20mcrab , and time coverage that does not really manage to capture the detail of the flaring time structure .",
    "a systematic search of the ibis data for both the large outburst and newly discovered outbursts has been performed to look for pulsations in the range 0.2 - 5000s .",
    "no statistically significant pulse period has been detected by this analysis and indeed no pulsations from sax j1818.6@xmath01703 have been reported in the literature .",
    "we conclude that although sax j1818.6@xmath01703 was originally detected as a transient , and later categorised as a sfxt , knowledge of the orbital solution enables us to see a rather different picture .",
    "sax j1818.6@xmath01703 is a supergiant system with a compact object in a 30 day orbit , and shows regular emission on at least 50% of the periastron passages .",
    "moreover , some periastron passages give rise to larger outbursts , during which fast flaring structure is evident in the light curve - it is this structure which has led to the identification as a sfxt .",
    "sax j1818.6@xmath01703 shows an extreme dynamic range of emission , from @xmath13 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) at apastron @xcite , to @xmath14 by extrapolation of the best - fit spectrum during the largest recorded ibis outburst @xcite to 0.5 - 10kev , which again supports the sfxt categorisation .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this behaviour is of a compact object in an eccentric orbit , periodically accreting from the wind of a donor supergiant .    as the second sfxt to be shown to have a periodic outbursting behaviour",
    ", sax j1818.6@xmath01703 adds to our overall picture of the supergiant binary systems , placed between the persistent systems with circular orbits , and the long - period system igr j11215@xmath05952 which shows outbursts on a 165 day period .",
    "this indicates that orbital characteristics may play an important role in the accretion mechanisms of these systems , much as they do in be transient systems",
    ". the shorter period of sax j1818.6@xmath01703 has enabled us to determine that the system shows a high degree of recurrence .",
    "the system appears similar to igr j18483@xmath00311 , which has an orbital period of 18.52 days , spin period of 21.0526 s , and has recently been confirmed as a supergiant system @xcite .",
    "other sfxt systems may eventually reveal similar behaviour , but with more eccentric orbits and/or lower recurrence rates which have so far prevented the determination of their orbital periods .",
    "we encourage detailed follow - up observations based on this orbital period , such as have proved so effective for igr j11215@xmath05952 .",
    "a detailed picture of the temporal structures seen during both faint and bright periastron passages should prove an invaluable probe into the environment from which the compact object is accreting .",
    "based on observations with integral , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , switzerland , spain ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa .",
