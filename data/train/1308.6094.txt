    "one of such open questions regards the fate of band electrons in graphene s honeycomb lattice when subject to repulsive interactions at half - filling .",
    "the plethora of techniques @xcite available to study the effect of interactions in this system has produced a range of interesting predictions . in particular , in a series of works , @xcite several groups have produced compatible mean - field phase diagrams that suggest that electrons in a honeycomb lattice with extended hubbard interactions at half filling stabilize a chern insulator ( ci ) phase with topological character and quantized hall conductivity .",
    "this phase is nothing but the celebrated haldane phase @xcite and it is realized at moderate value of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) @xmath0 and next to nearest neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath1 interactions but always with @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the ci phase is embedded in a rich structure of other competing orders in the phase diagram .",
    "the first of these is a charge density wave order ( cdw ) @xcite at @xmath3 with charge imbalance between the two different sublattices that reduces the amount of nn interaction energy to be paid .",
    "a sublattice charge modulated phase ( cms ) @xcite was also found for @xmath4 with charge imbalance over the same sublattice that compensates for the large @xmath1 cost . at sufficiently large @xmath5 ,",
    "a kekul bond order emerged @xcite characterized by a @xmath6 order parameter which can lead to fractionalized excitations of @xmath7 at the long wavelength limit .",
    "@xcite these phases have the additional interest of being also examples of an interaction driven gap for low energy quasiparticles in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "together , these works provide a clear consistent picture of the possible phases available within the mean - field perspective .",
    "however , the results are subject to the limitations of mean field theory , for ( i ) there is no certainty that all local order parameters relevant to the low energy physics have been considered ,  @xcite ( ii ) the ground state of the system might not be adiabatically connected to mean - field state with a local order parameter and ( iii ) the mean field phase can be over / under estimated in the parameter region of the phase diagram .",
    "+ to test the mean - field picture it is necessary to employ different tools as independent checks for the presence of the mean - field phases .",
    "one of such tools is exact diagonalization ( ed ) which we explore in this work .",
    "it is based on the ed of the hamiltonian for finite lattice sizes and it provides , in principle , an unbiased analysis of interactions .",
    "the main limitations for ed in two - dimensional quantum systems are the smallness of system sizes that can be studied .",
    "finite size effects might well out - range the energy scale of a potential many - body gap of incompressible ground states , so that the incompressibility can not be recognized .",
    "therefore , the limitations of ed and the mean - field approach are to a large extend complementary .",
    "if both methods yield the same phase for a region in parameter space , this provides strong evidence that the true ground state in the thermodynamic limit will be of this nature . phases that can not be easily detected with neither ed nor the mean - field approach include those with incommensurate long - range order .",
    "for example , depending on the system size and the particular geometry , ed might favor commensurate phases against frustrated phases and one has to be careful to explore ( whenever possible ) different sizes , and/or aspect ratios @xcite to pin down the relevant competing phases .",
    "indeed , ed has proven useful in studies of the haldane - hubbard model@xcite and the @xmath8-flux model , @xcite complementing other techniques such as quantum monte - carlo and variational cluster approximation used in studies of the hubbard and kane - mele - hubbard model in the honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite + motivated by these results , and in particular by the interaction driven phases found in existing mean - field calculations , in this work we study the spinless extended hubbard model with both nn and nnn interactions in the honeycomb lattice at half filling via ed of small finite size systems .",

    "we expect this state to appear at total momentum @xmath60 since it is a charge density wave ( cdw ) order state within the unit cell .",
    "indeed , the ed of the hamiltonian with @xmath67 and @xmath68 yields exactly this two fold degenerate ground - state at zero energy",
    ". the excited states that can be computed classically also coincide both in energy and degeneracy in this limit .",
    "it is possible to connect this strong coupling phase to the two - fold degenerate phase shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3x3 ] simply by increasing the hopping continuously to see that both phases are indeed connected without ever closing the many - body gap . from this fact alone",
    "we can already conclude that this state is a cdw state .",
    "a further check of this picture comes from calculating the charge density wave modulation in the same spirit as described in ref .  .",
    "suppose that we have a phase with a set of ( quasi-)degenerate ground states @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "for these , we define the sublattice - staggered electron density matrix @xmath71 for the cdw case we have in particular that @xmath72 with both @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : cdwpatt ] confirming the cdw interpretation of the state .",

    "the two particles highest in energy have momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus corresponding to a single state of total momentum @xmath60 . within the interacting model and since symmetry breaking",

    "as mentioned above , ed of finite systems can only yield precursors of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this means that if the kekul order is present , it should appear in all of its linearly independent forms which can be naively counted to be six , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kekulepatt](i ) .",
    "however , of these six possible kekul orders , three for each nn hopping distortion @xmath89 , only four are linearly independent , and the remaining two can be obtained as linear combinations of the other four [ see caption in fig .",

    "fig : pd3x3](c ) ] .",
    "the fact that the momenta appear at @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 supports this scenario since for a unit cell three times larger they all fold into the @xmath34 point , which means that one can build a hopping perturbation with a periodicity of three unit cells , exactly as the kekul would need .    in order to further evidence that this is a kekul phase",
    "we explore a construction similar to the charge density wave matrix this time for the hopping amplitudes @xmath90 with the same notation as above but now for @xmath91 quasi - degenerate ground states . in this case",
    "the momentum differences @xmath92 allow for a kekul bond order .",
    "as before , we diagonalize the matrix   and label the system of four eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "we can construct four independent superpositions corresponding to the four eigenvectors such that : @xmath96 with @xmath91 . when evaluated at the three different links @xmath97 the underlying hopping lattice of this phase is revealed .",
    "there are four of such patterns , one for each value of @xmath98 .",
    "+ however , if in the kekul phase , this procedure will in general produce an arbitrary superposition of all the possible kekul structures of fig .",

    "the four independent superpositions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kekulepatt](ii ) where the three different colors represent different bond strengths .",
    "note that each of these patterns has a tripled unit cell periodicity with the right kekul orders , inherited from the @xmath99dependent vectors @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , by forming linear combinations of these , one can obtain all the  pure \" ( coherent ) kekul patterns in fig .",
    "[ fig : kekulepatt](i ) .",
    "we find the analysis of this section to be consistent with the presence of the kekul phase in this part of the phase diagram .",
    "we finally address the last phase that remains to be characterized which we shall name as sublattice charge modulation or cms appearing at the upper left corner of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3x3](a ) .",
    "this phase , unlike the cdw , _ does not _ correspond to the naive classical strong coupling phase in the corresponding strong coupling limit .",
    "rather , the limit @xmath100 has an extensive classical ground state degeneracy so that quantum corrections will determine the form of the actual ground state for arbitrarily small non - zero values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the classical counting yields a @xmath103 fold degenerate ground state with energy @xmath104 for a @xmath51 lattice .",
    "this information serves in fact as a consistency check just as in the cdw case .",
    "indeed , we recover numerically the correct degeneracy and ground state energy in the limit @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the question then becomes , what phase will be selected by the quantum fluctuations out of the classical ground state manifold .",
    "from a large system with periodic boundary conditions a natural phase to be expected at half - filling for large @xmath107 is that with a charge modulation within the same sublattice , the cms phase .",
    "this phase , discussed in detail in ref .",
    ", reduces @xmath1 by paying an additional @xmath0 cost .",
    "pictorically the state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmspatt ] where it is evident that it has a degeneracy of 18 because of the rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "( color online ) cms patterns with their corresponding degeneracies due to a sixfold rotational symmetry . ]",
    "we find a phase consistent with this picture at large @xmath107 in ed with a quasi - degeneracy of @xmath108 .",
    "such a degeneracy slowly becomes more exact as one increases @xmath107 , although the gap to the excited states also decreases such that in the limit @xmath105 and @xmath106 the strong coupling phase is recovered .",
    "note also that , just as the kekul , the cms state has also a tripled unit cell periodicity @xcite which is consistent with having the ground states at momenta @xmath109 .",
    "despite the small system size , it is remarkable that the phase diagram fig .  [",
    "fig : pd3x3](i ) resembles very closely the mean - field phase diagram of ref .   at half - filling shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3x3 ] ( ii ) .",
    "we have found , out of the five mean - field phases , all but the ci phase .",
    "the @xmath51 lattice studied above is special in that not only it contains the @xmath35 and @xmath36 which enables clear physical interpretation of the emerging phases , but also it fits phases with a tripled unit cell without frustration , such as the kekul or the cms phases .",
    "therefore , such a lattice size has a natural bias towards these phases as compared to the ci phase , which does not break translational symmetries .",
    "this might be the reason why the kekul phase is so prevalent as compared to the mean - field phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd3x3 ] ( ii ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the kekule phase shifts to higher values of @xmath110 reducing the region for the charge modulated phase when comparing with the mean field result . since both phases are favored by the @xmath51 lattice size this result seems robust .    to investigate further the presence of the ci phase we have studied the @xmath111 and @xmath112 lattices for @xmath113 , where the ci phase is expected to appear from the mean - field analysis at intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "these lattice size frustrates the kekul and can leave phase space for other phases ( such as the ci phase ) to appear .    the ci phase for a finite system would appear as a two - fold quasi degenerate ground - state one for each sign of the flux , in a similar way as the cdw shows a two - fold degenerate ground - state corresponding to @xmath84 or @xmath87 charge in the a and b sublattices .",
    "however , we find no evidence of such signature and thus we conclude that this phase is absent also from the ed of @xmath111 and @xmath112 lattices .",
    "taking the @xmath114 as an example , the spectra along the @xmath1 line shows first a single ground - state at @xmath115 for low @xmath1 , as expected for the trivial sm phase just by adding all the non - interacting momenta in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonintbands](b ) . at @xmath116",
    "the gap closes and reopens with a six fold quasi - degenerate ground - state .",
    "the lowest pair of these states lie at @xmath115 , as would be expected for the ci phase .",
    "therefore , it remains an open question whether this six - fold degeneracy becomes two - fold by increasing the lattice size , which could in principle lead in the thermodynamic limit to the appearance of the haldane phase .",
    "finally we comment on a different route towards achieving interaction driven topological phases in the extended hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice which involves moving away from half - filling .",
    "an example of these topological phases were shown to appear at higher fillings from a mean - field calculation in ref",
    ". these are generalizations of the haldane phase at fillings @xmath117 and with a tripled unit cell , which could also be present via ed . however , identifying these phases by characterizing the ground state properties from ed is challenging due to band folding .",
    "we have investigated the effect of extended hubbard interactions on spinless electrons on the honeycomb lattice at half filling via exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "we have found that four out of the five predicted mean - field phases are present .",
    "these are the semi - metal ( sm ) , cdw , the kekul bond order and the sublattice charge modulation ( cms ) phases .",
    "first , we have shown that the six - fold degeneracy of the sm ground - state can be understood entirely from the non - interacting band structure . for the cdw phase",
    "we have proven that it is connected to the strong coupling phase at @xmath118,@xmath66 and we have characterized it finding a finite sublattice charge imbalance through the charge order correlation function , the hallmark for the cdw phase .",
    "the two - fold degeneracy is a sign of the two possible orders that the system can choose in the thermodynamic limit by spontaneously breaking the sublattice symmetry .",
    "similarly , we have disentangled the kekul bond order phase by calculating the bond order correlation function which reveals the underlying superposition of four independent kekul patterns which conform the fourfold quasi - degenerate ground - state .",
    "finally , we have argued that for @xmath2 the cms phase is expected to have a 18-fold degeneracy favoured by the costly nnn interaction , which is consistent with what we observed in ed .",
    "importantly , the fact that the discussed phases appear both in ed and in mean - field suggests that they are stable up to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the appearance of the kekul phase dominating a wide region of the phase diagram opens up the possibility of realizing this exotic phase in cold atoms with a scheme along the lines of ref .  .",
    "despite the fact that we have not found evidence for the chern insulator ( ci ) phase , it is still possible that it is realizable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "different approaches such as cluster mean - field @xcite can also prove useful to ascertain the presence of the ci phase .",
