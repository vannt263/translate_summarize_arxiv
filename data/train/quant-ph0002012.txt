    "in classical mechanics , the problem of two particles , which interact with force depending only on the relative distance between them , is separated into two three - dimensional problems : the free - particle problem and one of a particle in a static potential field  @xcite .",
    "motion of a free particle , whose mass is equal to the sum of the masses of both particles , is a motion of the center of masses of the system and is uniform and rectilinear .",
    "motion of a relative particle with so - called reduced mass occurs in the field with potential @xmath0 .",
    "an analogous situation is also observed for the nonrelativistic wave equation of a system of two interacting particles , which was proposed by schrdinger already in the second communication on wave mechanics by the example of elastic rotator ( two - atom molecule )  @xcite .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation of the square of the modulus of a wave function is possible only under the assumption that measurements of coordinates or momenta of various particles do not principally disturb one another even if there exists some interaction between particles  @xcite .",
    "this means that operators of coordinates and momenta of two particles commute with each other .",
    "but in the theory of schrdinger , still operators of coordinates and momenta of various particles commute with one another that is equivalent to the lacking of any interference on measurement of the coordinate of one particle and the momentum of the other .",
    "the last assertion is valid if the duration of measurement of the coordinate of a particle is much less than the duration of propagation of a light signal at distances of about the size of the system , or , what is the same , if the compton wave length is much less than the size of the system .",
    "therefore , the schrdinger equation perfectly works in atomic physics and solid - state physics . but a direct application of the schrdinger equation to atomic nuclei seems not entirely correct because the compton wave length of a nucleon is of order of the size of an atomic nucleus itself .",
    "in addition , a rigorous nonrelativistic statement requires to consider the interaction propagation velocity to be infinitely large that forces us to assume that operators of coordinates and momenta of various particles do not commute with one another .",
    "as is known , classical equations of motion of a particle with mass @xmath1 in an external field @xmath0 follow from the hamilton function @xmath2 which depends on the coordinates @xmath3 of the particle and on the corresponding momentum @xmath4 . the total energy of the system @xmath5    with this classical system , we associate a quantum system , whose dynamic state is represented by the wave function @xmath6 defined in the configuration space .",
    "the wave equation is deduced by the formal substitution of the quantities @xmath7 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 in both sides of relation  ( [ e2 ] ) by the corresponding operators  @xcite : @xmath8 here , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the universal constant introduced by planck .",
    "it is meant that the result of action of both sides of equality  ( [ e2 ] ) , considered as operators , on @xmath6 is the same .",
    "the realization of this fact implies the schrdinger nonrelativistic equation for a particle in an external field @xmath0 : @xmath11 \\psi ( { \\bf r,}t)\\ , .   \\label{e6}\\ ] ]    it is worth to emphasize that the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 in  ( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) are written in the configuration space , and @xmath14 is the vector of position of the particle in the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "operators of coordinate and momentum do not commute with each other : @xmath15 = i\\hbar \\,,\\text{\\quad } \\left [ \\hat{y},\\,% \\hat{p}_{y}\\right ] = i\\hbar \\,,\\text{\\quad } \\left [ \\hat{z},\\,\\hat{p}_{z}% \\right ] = i\\hbar \\ , ,   \\label{e7}\\ ] ] that leads to the heisenberg uncertainty relations @xmath16 where the quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are directly connected with corresponding measurements and present mean square deviations from the mean value . for example , we have @xmath23 for the coordinate @xmath24 , by definition , where @xmath25 is the mean value of the operator @xmath26 in the dynamic state defined by a wave function @xmath6 .",
    "relations  ( [ e8 ] ) assert that a particle can not be in states , in which its coordinate and momentum simultaneously take quite definite , exact values .",
    "moreover , quantum theory accepts that an unpredictable and uncontrolled perturbation , undergone by a physical system in the process of measurement , is always finite and such that the heisenberg uncertainty relations  ( [ e8 ] ) are satisfied  @xcite .",
    "hence , no experiment can lead to a simultaneous exact measurement of the coordinate and momentum of a particle .",
    "for example , the measurement of the coordinate @xmath24 with accuracy @xmath27 in the well - known experiment with a microscope , considered by heisenberg , is accompanied by the uncontrolled transfer of momentum to the particle , which is characterized by the uncertainty @xmath28 in this case , limits of the accuracy of determination of a position are set always by the optical resolution stipulated by diffraction effects according to classical wave optics .",
    "for example , it is known that the limit accuracy of an image @xmath17 for a microscope is defined by the formula @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wave length of scattered light , which can differ from that of incident light , and @xmath31 is half the objective aperture . according to relation  ( [ e11 ] ) , to increase the accuracy , it is profitable to have the wave length of scattered light as short as possible . but owing to the compton effect , the frequency of scattered light changes by a value defined by the conservation laws of energy and momentum .",
    "this implies that , even in the limit @xmath32@xmath33 , the frequency of scattered emission @xmath34 can not exceed some finite value .",
    "if @xmath4 is a momentum , @xmath35 is a velocity , and @xmath36 is the energy of a material particle prior to the process of scattering , then we have  @xcite @xmath37 in this limit , which gives a maximum value for @xmath34 and a minimum one for @xmath38 . here , @xmath39 is the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "thus , to attain the maximum accuracy of determination of a position on the observation of the scattering of a quantum of light by using an optical instrument , we obtain the following expression : @xmath40    the duration of the process of measurement of a position , i.e. , the time , during which the interaction between a light quantum and a particle can occur , can in no way be less than the periods of oscillations of the incident and scattered emissions and should be of the order of @xmath41 @xmath42    if the size of the system is such that a characteristic time of flight for the system significantly exceeds @xmath43 , then one can say that the process of measurement of the particle coordinate with accuracy @xmath17 is followed by an impact on a particle with the force @xmath44 here , we assume that the momentum transferred to a particle under measurement of its coordinate is of order of the mean square deviation @xmath45 .    on the measurement of the momentum of a particle with accuracy @xmath18 , it undergoes an impact with force @xmath46    consider now a system of two interacting particles , whose hamilton function is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are cartesian coordinates of two particles with masses @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are their corresponding momenta , and the potential energy depends only on the distance between particles . to derive the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation for this system , we proceed analogously to eq .",

    "that is , one supposes that the change in the force action of a particle on another one , caused by a measurement of the coordinate of the first , propagates with finite velocity .    thus , to derive the schrdinger nonrelativistic equation for a two - particle system , one uses , on the one hand , the hamilton classical nonrelativistic function and , on the other hand , the implicit assumption about finiteness of the interaction propagation velocity .    in the fully nonrelativistic quantum theory",
    ", we must consider the interaction propagation velocity as infinitely large , which forces us to drop the requirement for the commutation relations  ( [ e26 ] ) to hold .",

    "the fulfillment of relations  ( [ e25 ] ) is not obligatory for a system of interacting particles , and we intend to reject this requirement .",
    "it is clear that , on measuring the coordinate of some particle with accuracy @xmath17 , the system undergoes an impact with force @xmath67 .",
    "for example , the measurement of the coordinate of a nonrelativistic electron under observation of the scattering of a light quantum with an optical device with the greatest possible accuracy of order of the compton wave length @xmath68 is accompanied by impact with the force @xmath69 . for a proton with its compton wave length of the order of @xmath70 ,",
    "the impact force is about @xmath71 .",

    "therefore , whereas we can neglect the interaction force @xmath74 between particles on measuring the coordinates of particles in an atom and consider the operators of coordinates and momenta of various particles to be commuting , it is not the case for an atomic nucleus , because the ratio of the interparticle interaction force to the impact one is of order @xmath75 .",
