    "charged dust grains and dusty plasmas @xcite are ubiquitous in astrophysical environments ( e.g. interstellar media , molecular dusty clouds , star forming clouds , supernovae such as the eagle nebula , etc . ) , in planetary ring systems @xcite ( e.g. the spokes in saturn s rings recorded by the voyager spacecraft cameras ) , in our solar system ( e.g. interplanetary dust particles produced by comets ) , as well as near the sun s and earth s atmospheres ( e.g. the mesospheric and ionospheric regions ) .",
    "charged dust particles are naturally formed in industrial processing of nanotechnology and in magnetic fusion reactors .",
    "it is well - known that charging of a neutral dust particle occurs due to a variety of physical processes @xcite , including the collection of electrons from the background plasma , photo emissions , tribo - electric effects , etc . in the remote past , it was shown by wuerker _",
    "@xcite that an ensemble of electrically charged iron and aluminum particles having diameters of a few microns can be confined by three - dimensional focusing forces of alternating and static electric fields and the coulomb repulsion , leading eventually to the formation of crystallized arrays of ions and aluminum dust particles , which can be melted and reformed . however , a dusty plasma is usually composed of electrons , positive ions , negative or positive dust grains , and neutral atoms .",
    "when the interaction potential energy ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dust charge state , @xmath2 the magnitude of the electron charge , and @xmath3 the inter - dust grain distance or the wigner - seitz radius ) between two neighboring dust grains is much larger ( smaller ) than the dust kinetic energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath6 the dust temperature , the dusty plasma is in a strongly ( weakly ) coupled state . following the charged particles condensation",
    "idea @xcite of one component strongly correlated electron system , ikezi @xcite postulated the solidification of charged dust particles when the dusty plasma @xmath7 exceeds 172 , taking into account the plasma screening effect , where @xmath8 is the plasma debye radius @xcite .",
    "such values of @xmath9 can be achieved in low - temperature laboratory discharges at room temperatures owing to the large @xmath1 acquired by a micron - size dust grain by absorbing electrons from the background plasma .",
    "there are also monte - carlo and molecular dynamics simulations that accurately depict different states of ordered dust structures @xcite when dust grains are repelling each other according to the yukawa or debye - hckel force .",
    "the phase diagram for @xmath10 against @xmath11 = average inter - dust grain spacing / dusty plasma debye radius , indeed reveal dust solid face - centered cubic ( fcc ) , dust solid body - centered cubic ( bcc ) and dust fluid phases for a set of @xmath10 and @xmath11 values , as given in ivlev _",
    "@xcite where an empirical scaling for dust crystal melting is also given .",
    "the formation of dust coulomb crystals and ordered dust structures have been observed in the sheath region of many laboratory experiments @xcite , where charged dust grains are kept together due to confining electrostatic potentials in a plasma sheath .",
    "however , robust ordered dust structures may also be formed due to attractive forces @xcite between negative dust grains associated with ion focusing and ion wakefields @xcite in a dusty plasma sheath with streaming ions , shadowing forces due to collisions with ions @xcite , as well as due to overlapping debye spheres @xcite and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . the alignment of charged dust grains in an assembly due to the attractive force associated with ion focusing and ion wakefield effects has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the collective behavior of dusty plasmas involving an ensembles of charged dust grains was recognized through the prediction of the dust acoustic wave ( daw ) by shukla @xcite at the first capri workshop on dusty plasmas in may of 1989 , where he suggested the existence of the nonlinear daw in the presence of boltzmann distributed electrons and ions , and massive , charged dust particles .",
    "this idea was then worked out in the first paper @xcite on the daw .",
    "it must be stressed that there does not exist a counterpart of the daw in an electron - ion plasma without charged dust grains , since the daw is supported by the dust particle inertia , and the restoring force comes from the pressures of the inertialess hot electron and ions .",
    "thus , similar to the alfvn wave in a magnetized plasma , the daw is of fundamental importance in laboratory and space plasmas physics .",
    "the daw is usually excited by an ion streaming instability , and has a frequency much smaller than the dusty plasma frequency , extending into the infra - sonic frequency range .",
    "low - frequency ( of the order of 10 hz ) da fluctuations were first observed in the experiment of chu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and have since been observed in many laboratory experiments world - wide @xcite , and also in the earth s ionosphere @xcite .",
    "ichimaru _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite further extended the theory of strong coupling and viscosity coefficients for a high - density one component electron plasma .",
    "berkovsky @xcite developed a generalized hydrodynamic model for plasmas with strongly coupled ions and degenerate electrons , and used it to investigate the linear properties of modified ion - acoustic waves .",
    "a similar theory was developed for strongly correlated dust grains in dusty plasmas by kaw and sen @xcite , who presented a generalized viscoelastic hydrodynamic model for strongly correlated dust grains and investigated the linear properties of dust acoustic waves , especially the low - frequency longitudinal and transverse modes in a strongly coupled dusty plasma .",
    "the latter model has also been extended to the weakly nonlinear regime @xcite to study the propagation of small amplitude nonlinear dust acoustic waves in a strongly coupled dusty plasma .    however , recently a number of laboratory experiments @xcite have reported observations of nonlinear daws in the form of extremely large amplitude da shocks @xcite and da solitary pulses @xcite at kinetic levels .",
    "physically , the large amplitude da shocks are formed when nonlinearities in plasmas balance the daw dissipation caused by the dust fluid viscosity coming from dust grain correlations in strongly coupled dusty plasmas , while da solitary pulses arise in the collisionless regime due to the balance between the harmonic generation nonlinearities and the daw dispersion . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there are no theories for arbitrary large amplitude nonlinear , nonstationary da shocks and da solitary pulses in dusty plasmas with dust correlations .",
    "it should be stressed that small amplitude theories for da shocks and da solitary pulses based on the burgers @xcite , korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) , and kdv - burgers equations @xcite are not suitable for explaining observations @xcite that report anomalously high ( up to @xmath12 and beyond ) dust density compressions .",
    "a large amplitude theory of eliasson and shukla @xcite for a collisionless dusty plasma explains well the daw steepening and nonlinear wave speed @xcite , but is unable to predict the shock width observed in the experiments .    in this paper , we present a fully nonlinear , non - stationary unified theory for arbitrary large amplitude da shocks and da solitary pulses in a dusty plasma , taking into account the effects of strong coupling between charged dust grains , the nonlinear polarization force acting on charged dust grains due to thermal ions that shield negative dust grains , collisions between charged dust grains and neutrals , dust correlations decay rate , the dust fluid shear and bulk viscosities , etc .",
    "this gives a more complete picture of various non - ideal effects in dusty plasmas , and we are thus able to provide a comparison between our new non - stationary and fully nonlinear theory with the recent laboratory observations of da shocks and da solitary pulses @xcite .",
    "neglected are effects due to attractive forces ( ion focusing , wake fields , etc . ) between dust grains , which may affect the equation of state and transport coefficients of the system .",
    "these effects , however , are either small or depend on the moment transfer of streaming ions , which we do not consider here .",
    "we consider a dusty plasma composed of inertialess electrons and ions , as well as strongly correlated negatively charged micron - sized dust particles of uniform sizes . in the presence of large amplitude ultra - low frequency da waves , with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wave frequency , @xmath15 @xmath16 the electron ( ion)-neutral collision frequency , @xmath17 the wave number , and @xmath18 @xmath19 the electron ( ion ) thermal speed .",
    "both electrons and ions follow the boltzmann law , since they can be considered inertialess on the timescale of the daw period , and henceforth rapidly thermalize under the action of collisions .",
    "thus , the electron and ion number densities are , respectively , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unperturbed electron and ion number densities , respectively , @xmath2 the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath24 the electrostatic potential , @xmath5 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath25 @xmath26 the electron ( ion ) temperature . at equilibrium",
    ", we have the quasi - neutrality condition @xmath27 , where @xmath1 is the average number of electrons residing on a dust grain , and @xmath28 the unperturbed dust number density .",
    "the dust particle dynamics associated with fully nonlinear , non - stationary daws in a strongly coupled dusty plasma is governed by the generalized hydrodynamic equations composed of the dust continuity equation @xmath29 , and the generalized dust momentum equation @xmath30\\nonumber \\\\ = \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho_d } \\nabla^2 { \\bf v}_d + \\frac{\\left(\\xi + \\frac{\\eta}{3}\\right)}{\\rho_d }   \\nabla ( \\nabla \\cdot { \\bf v}_d),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking into account finite amplitude convective and pressure nonlinearities @xcite , nonlinear ion polarization force , strong dust coupling effects @xcite , and dust neutral collisions @xcite .",

    "the dust - neutral collision frequency is given by the epstein formula @xcite @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the neutral mass , @xmath51 the neutral number density , @xmath52 the dust grain radius , @xmath53 the neutral thermal speed , and @xmath54 the neutral gas temperature .",
    "the visco - elastic properties of the dust fluids are characterized by the dust correlation relaxation time @xcite @xmath55/\\left[1-\\mu_d + 4 u(\\gamma)/15\\right]$ ] , involving the shear and bulk viscosities @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "there are various approaches for calculating @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which are widely discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the da wave potential @xmath24 is obtained from poisson s equation @xmath58 , taking into account the dispersive effect due to the departure from quasi - neutrality .",
    "the ion drag force @xcite acting on a dust grain has been neglected in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is justified since the ions are assumed to follow the boltzmann distribution with no ion momentum flow . however , in a dusty plasmas with large dust particles and equilibrium ion flows , there can be an instability with a growth rate much smaller than the daw frequency @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the simplest problem of one - dimensional nonlinear daws propagating along the @xmath59-axis in a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "we define the dimensionless variables @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dust acoustic speed , @xmath64 the dust plasma frequency , and @xmath65 the unit vector along the @xmath66axis .",

    "we are assuming here that the constant parameter @xmath88 is given for a set of experiments ; however , it has been experimentally shown @xcite that @xmath1 is typically reduced for closely packed ( @xmath89 ) dust grains .",
    "this effect , which can be important at high dust number densities , will be neglected here for simplicity .",
    "furthermore , the dust charge fluctuation effect has been neglected , since the dust charging time - period ( @xmath90 ) is usually much shorter than the time period for the formation of nonlinear daws we are concerned with @xcite , and the fugacity parameter @xmath91 is smaller than 1 , where the expressions for @xmath92 and @xmath93 are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a stationary frame",
    "such that all physical variables depend only on @xmath94 with @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the constant speed of the nonlinear da waves , we have @xmath97 , so that the dust momentum equation ( 3 ) reads @xmath98 \\frac{\\gamma}{p } \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial \\zeta } + t_0 \\frac{\\partial { \\rm ln } n}{\\partial \\zeta}\\bigg ] \\\\ & + \\frac{\\beta m}{\\lambda } \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\zeta^2}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{n}\\bigg ) = 0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which couples with poisson s equation @xmath99    quasistationary da shock waves exist only for @xmath100 , when the dust - neutral collisions can be neglected .",

    "<S> , we use a generalized hydrodynamic model for the strongly coupled dust grains , accounting for arbitrary large amplitude dust number density compressions and potential distributions associated with fully nonlinear nonstationary da waves . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent numerical solutions of our nonlinear model compare favorably well with the recent experimental works ( mentioned above ) that have reported the formation of large amplitude non - stationary da shocks and da solitary pulses in low - temperature dusty plasma discharges . </S>"
