    ". statistical analysis of such random fields can not be restricted to the standard tools of the theory of gaussian random functions ( and related ones , such as log - normal and @xmath9 functions ) , where the probability distribution and second - order correlation functions provide a complete description .",
    "however , correlation analysis remains an important first step , where the form of the correlation function , the correlation length ( or time ) and the mean - square variations of a variable are the most important quantities explored .",
    "there are numerous and diverse estimates of the integral ( correlation ) scale of interstellar turbulence @xmath10 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the autocorrelation function of the line - of - sight cloud velocities obtained in the milky way by @xcite leads to @xmath11 .",

    "@xcite yielded @xmath14 from the structure functions of the variations in the faraday rotation and emission measures across extended extragalactic radio sources .",
    "structure functions of the faraday rotation of extragalactic sources @xcite and their degree of depolarization @xcite give @xmath15 in the milky way s spiral arms .",

    "these estimates are strikingly different , perhaps not surprisingly",
    ". they have been obtained from diverse tracers , and it is not surprising that the correlation length of the gas velocities , faraday rotation measure and synchrotron fluctuations differ ( the latter being nonlinear functions of the fluctuating quantities ) .",
    "a relation between the correlation length of the product of random functions and those of the multipliers depends on their detailed statistical properties ( e.g. ,  6.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "our aim here is to clarify this relation .",
    "this would be difficult to do with observational data , at least at present .",
    "interpretations of observations of polarized synchrotron emission and its faraday rotation suggest that a significant fraction of the polarization may be due to anisotropy of the random magnetic field .",

    "modeling of pre- and post - shock polarized emission in the barred galaxies ngc1097 and ngc1365 @xcite and the spiral galaxy m51 @xcite , the dispersion of polarization angles in m51 @xcite , comparison of the observed polarized emission and faraday rotation in m33 @xcite , and modeling depolarization in m51 @xcite , have all indicated the presence of anisotropic random fields . extracting the degree of anisotropy from the observations , though , is difficult .    in m51 ,",
    "@xcite estimate that the ratio of the standard deviations of the random magnetic field components in orthogonal directions is @xmath20 and @xcite obtained a ratio of correlation lengths along and perpendicular to the local mean - field direction of @xmath21 .",
    "as with observational estimates for @xmath22 , it is appropriate to carefully examine the possible anisotropy of the random magnetic field .    simulations of the sn - regulated ism have become sufficiently realistic to treat them as numerical experiments .",
    "it is then natural to use sufficiently realistic numerical models to address these questions before the more difficult observational exploration .",
    "we use such simulations , as detailed in @xcite and @xcite , which have non - trivial magnetic fields generated by dynamo action , to clarify the correlation ( and other statistical ) properties of the multi - phase ism .",
    "in particular , we compare the autocorrelation and cross - correlation functions of the random ( i.e. , small - scale ; see  [ sect : averaging ] ) velocity and magnetic fields and density fluctuations , as well as the faraday depth and synchrotron intensity .",
    "however complex , the simulations of the ism can hardly be considered as trustworthy representations of the ism in its whole complexity . therefore , the goal of our analysis is not to achieve quantitative agreement with observations in every detail ( although the general agreement is quite remarkable ) but rather to identify those physical processes that shape the simulated ism and are likely to be important in reality .",
    "turbulent flows are often represented in spectral space , in terms of the fourier transforms of the physical variables .",
    "such transforms are straightforward in infinite or periodic spaces .",
    "however , simulations of the ism are performed in relatively small domains , only containing of order one thousand correlation cells , not simply - periodic because of the open ( or similar ) boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the domain , and statistically inhomogeneous because of the stratification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we use our earlier simulations of the ism based on the pencil code ( http://pencil-code.nordita.org/ ) , described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations involve solving the full , compressible , non - ideal mhd equations with parameters generally typical of the solar neighborhood in a three - dimensional local cartesian , shearing box with radial ( @xmath32 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath33 ) extents of @xmath34 and vertical ( @xmath6 ) extent @xmath35 on either side of the mid - plane at @xmath36 .",

    "the navier  stokes equation includes a fixed vertical gravity force that includes contributions from the stellar disk and spherical dark halo .",
    "the initial state is an approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the galactic differential rotation is modelled by a background shear flow @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the shear parameter and @xmath47 is the galactic angular velocity . here",
    "we use @xmath48 , as in a flat rotation curve , and @xmath49 , as in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the velocity @xmath41 is the perturbation velocity in the rotating frame , that remains after the subtraction of the background shear flow from the total velocity .",
    "however , it still contains a large - scale vertical component due to an outflow driven by the sn activity .",

    "the frequencies used correspond to those in the solar neighborhood . we introduce type ii sne at a mean rate , per unit surface area , of @xmath50 .",

    "their vertical positions have gaussian distributions with scale heights of @xmath52 and @xmath53 for snii and sni , respectively .",
    "no spatial clustering of the sne is included .",
    "the thermal energy injected with each sn is @xmath54 .",
    "injected velocity and the uneven density within each explosion site randomly adds kinetic energy with mean @xmath55 .",
    "we include radiative cooling with a parameterized cooling function . for @xmath56",
    ", we adopt a power - law fit to the ` standard equilibrium ' pressure - density curve of @xcite , as given in @xcite . for @xmath57 , we use the cooling function of @xcite .",
    "this cooling allows the ism to separate into distinct hot , warm and cold phases identifiable as peaks in the joint probability distribution of gas in density and temperature .",
    "photoelectric heating is also included as in @xcite . the heating decreases with @xmath58 on a length scale comparable to the scale height of the disk near the sun .    shock - capturing kinetic , thermal and magnetic diffusivities ( in addition to constant small background diffusivities ) , are included to resolve shock discontinuities and maintain numerical stability in the navier  stokes , heat and induction equations .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in @xmath33 , and sheared - periodic boundary conditions in @xmath32 ( considered in more detail in  [ sect : shear ] ) .",
    "open boundary conditions , permitting outflow and inflow , are used at the vertical ( @xmath6 ) boundaries .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for further details on the boundary conditions used and on the other implementations described above .",
    "our analysis is based on 12 snapshots of the computational volume in the range @xmath59 , by which time the system , including the large - scale magnetic field , has reached a statistically steady state . the interval between the snapshots , @xmath60 ,",
    "is significantly longer than the correlation time of the random flow ( see  [ sect : time_correlation ] ) , and is sufficient for the snapshots to be considered statistically independent .    to test the influence of shear rate on the correlations , we also analyse data from a model with twice the rotation rate , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we use 12 snapshots in the range @xmath59 , again with a separation of @xmath60 , with the magnetic field saturated as for the main run .",
    "any notable differences between the results for the different models will be reported throughout the text .",
    "the numerical model exhibits three distinct states of the gas corresponding to local maxima in the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the specific entropy @xmath42 .",
    "gas parameters in those states are similar to the three main phases of the ism .",
    "following @xcite , the cold phase is defined as that having @xmath61 , the hot phase has @xmath62 , with the warm phase in between .",
    "the three phases have very different physical properties , including the random velocity and magnetic fields , as well as differing in their mean temperature and density .",
    "therefore , our analysis is carried out for each phase separately .",
    "for this purpose , only grid points corresponding to a given phase are retained in the data cubes containing each physical variable , with the other points masked out .",
    "this allows us to do the averaging required in the computation of the structure functions over disjoint regions in the physical space .",
    "our analysis is conducted for the moduli of the random magnetic and velocity fields and the gas density fluctuations , denoted @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the random velocity @xmath66 should be carefully distinguished from the velocity perturbation @xmath67 , defined as the deviation from the background large - scale shear flow , since the latter contains a systematic vertical velocity .",
    "since the mean vertical velocity and the large - scale magnetic field are not necessarily uniform across any horizontal plane , we do not use horizontal averages to define the mean magnetic field as is often done in the literature , but instead follow @xcite and use gaussian smoothing , within the framework of @xcite .",
    "the mean ( large - scale ) component of a random field @xmath68 , averaged over a scale @xmath69 and denoted @xmath70 , is defined by a convolution with a gaussian kernel @xmath71 , @xmath72 \\ , , \\label{eq : gauss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where integration is extended to the volume occupied by a given ism phase or the total volume as appropriate .",

    "following @xcite , we use @xmath76 .    as discussed by @xcite , a significant fraction of the energy in the random field remains at length scales greater than @xmath69 . to clarify the consequences of this ,",

    ", the mean field @xmath80 has the fourier transform @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the transform of the smoothing kernel . for the gaussian kernel @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 , so @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for variations with wavenumber @xmath86 ( and wavelength @xmath87 ) , a fraction @xmath88 of the original field energy is interpreted as that of the mean field , and the remainder goes into the random field .",
    "this fraction is half ",
    "i.e. , the field energy is equally split between mean and random fields  at the wave number @xmath89 , or the wavelength @xmath90 .",
    "thus , with @xmath91 , the field energy is equally split at the wavelength @xmath92 between the mean and random parts .",
    "variations with wavelength @xmath93 go predominantly into the random field , and increasingly so as @xmath94 decreases ; for features with @xmath95 , only a fraction @xmath96 of the energy goes into the mean field .          we start the calculations with the second - order structure functions @xmath97 , which are more robust than the correlation functions , @xmath98 , with respect to errors (  13.1 in * ? ? ?",

    "since we are dealing with periodic ( or sheared periodic ) functions in @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the maximum offsets we can consider in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions are half the domain sizes in each direction .",

    "we resolve this problem by fitting the measured correlation functions with physically motivated forms , which can then be integrated over an infinite range .",
    "the difference between the correlations lengths obtained with and without this fitting can be as large as a factor of two .    given the complex structure of the simulated ism , it is not surprising that different physical variables have different correlation functions and different correlation lengths @xmath10 , as shown in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the observational estimates available for the correlations lengths in the ism provide a wide range of values depending on the quantity observed .",
    "conclusive comparison with observations requires detailed knowledge of the statistical properties of the random fields involved and their cross - correlations @xcite .",
    "interstellar turbulence can not be characterized by a single correlation length .",
    "we have estimated the correlation time of the velocity fluctuations @xmath182 . in the simulations used",
    "here,@xmath183 is close to both the eddy turnover time , @xmath184 and the estimated time interval between the passage of shock fronts through a given position , @xmath185 .",
    "the correlation time is likely to be sensitive to the supernova rate ( and then , star formation rate ) and may be closer to @xmath186 when the supernova rate is higher . further calculations with varying supernova rates are needed to explore under what conditions either physical process dominates the correlation time .    the random magnetic field is noticeably anisotropic , with larger rms values for azimuthal ( @xmath33 ) and vertical ( @xmath6 ) components in comparison to the radial ( @xmath32 ) component , with @xmath187 the strongest component .",
    "the enhanced @xmath33-component is produced by the action of the large - scale velocity shear on the radial turbulent magnetic field @xmath188 , with the enhanced @xmath6 component produced by stretching of the horizontal magnetic field by the random part of the vertical velocity @xmath189 . from the rms values of @xmath188 and @xmath190",
    ", we estimate a degree of polarization of @xmath191 that may be produced by the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "we also performed correlation analysis of the faraday depth along the vertical direction through the computational domain .",
    "its correlation scale , @xmath192 , is significantly larger than the correlation scales of electron density ( @xmath193 ) and of vertical magnetic field ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "this suggests that there is no simple and universal relationship between the correlation scales of electron density , vertical magnetic field and faraday depth .",
    "analysis of the total and polarized synchrotron intensities is hampered by a rapid increase of the scatter of data points around the average contributions to the structure and correlation functions .",
    "this difficulty is evident in the correlation analysis but would not be apparent in the power spectra , where statistical errors are difficult to estimate .",

    "the computational domain used to obtain our results , about @xmath194 , contains only about @xmath195 correlation cells and , in addition , may be too small to accommodate the most rapidly growing mode of the large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the large - scale dynamo remains in its kinematic stage in the larger domain , but otherwise the simulation has achieved a statistically steady state .",
    "therefore , we verify the results using similar simulations in a larger domain , approximately @xmath196 in size .",
    "the velocity shear rate is that of the solar neighborhood , @xmath197 , and we analyze data from @xmath198 snapshots in the range @xmath199 , with a separation of @xmath200 .    the results from the larger domain are compared with those obtained from the kinematic stage of the large - scale dynamo in the main run discussed in the text .",
    "we use data from 21 snapshots in the range @xmath201 , with a separation of @xmath202 .",
    "we find very similar correlations in @xmath63 between the two runs ( see figure  [ fig : figure15 ] and table  [ tab : table7 ] ) , but there are more significant differences for @xmath64 ( see figure  [ fig : figure16 ] and table  [ tab : table7 ] ; the latter also gives comparable statistics for a similar kinematic state in the standard domain ) .",
    "the correlation lengths of @xmath64 are actually smaller for the larger domain , so the difference does not simply result from velocity structures having been restricted in size . in light of the differences noted above , further simulations are needed before a direct comparison can be made ."
