    "<S> the method exploited here is also more powerful than colliding the lhc with lep ; such a hybrid would only be capable of generating leptoquarks with masses of less than @xmath16  1.5  tev @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical arguments have been discussed , based on technicolor models for instance , which would favor the coupling of the heavy leptons and quarks to leptoquarks @xcite , preferably @xmath90 and @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> these particles will obviously be produced in pairs through gluon fusion and quark  antiquark annihilation at the tevatron and lhc with the model  independent standard scalar cross section . </S>",
    "<S> of course , single leptoquark production mechanisms are less competitive compared to leptoquark pair production when considering these @xmath90 and @xmath91 states [ and @xmath92 , @xmath93 since the relevant quark flux in the proton beam must be generated by splitting gluons or involves sea quarks . nevertheless , there may be somewhat of a compensating advantage even here because of the relatively clean signature from single leptoquark production at small and moderate transverse momenta . </S>"
