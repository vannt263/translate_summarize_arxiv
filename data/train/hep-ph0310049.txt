    "the main goal of the ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions programme is to create in terrestrial laboratories a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the existence of this phase , where quarks and gluons are deconfined , i.e. can freely move over several hadronic distances , is a definite prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in a search for qgp signals",
    "a - a collisions at different centre of mass energies per nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) pair have been studied : from few gev to several hundreds of gev recently attained in au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "recently , accurate measurements of hadron production in central pb - pb collisions at 40 , 80 and 158@xmath0 gev of beam energy became available @xcite and also preliminary data at 30@xmath0 gev have been presented @xcite following an energy scan programme carried out by the experiment na49 at cern sps .",
    "this programme is motivated by the hypothesis @xcite that the threshold for creation of qgp in the early stage of pb - pb collisions might be located in the low sps energy range , roughly between 20 and 40@xmath0 gev of beam energy .",
    "one of the main results of the study of high energy a - a collisions is a surprising success of the statistical - thermal models in reproducing essential features of particle production @xcite .",
    "this model succeeds also in describing particle multiplicities in many kinds of elementary collisions @xcite , suggesting that statistical production is a general property of the hadronization process itself @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) supplemented with the hydrodynamical expansion of the matter , to a large extent also reproduces transverse momentum spectra of different particle species @xcite .",
    "hence , the shm model proves to be a useful tool for the analysis of soft hadron production and particularly to study strangeness production , whose enhancement has since long been proposed as a signature of qgp formation .",
    "furthermore , anomalies in the energy dependence of strangeness production have been predicted as a signature of deconfinement and have been indeed observed experimentally @xcite , suggesting that the onset of the phase transition could be located around 30@xmath0 gev .",
    "it is thus important to make a systematic analysis , within the framework of shm , of the presently available hadronic multiplicities measured in pb - pb collisions at 30 , 40 and 80@xmath0 gev , which - to our knowledge - is done here for the first time .",
    "along with these intriguing questions , our work is also motivated by issues related to the application of statistical model itself .",
    "in fact , different versions of this model have been used in the past by different authors leading to somewhat different results and conclusions .",
    "these mainly stem from the alternative use of midrapidity and full phase space multiplicities , from the allowance of non - equilibrium abundances of hadrons , from the assumption of exact local vanishing strangeness etc .",
    "therefore , we consider the comparison of these different approaches a worthwhile step .",
    "this has been made it possible by now by the availability of an accurate and large multiplicity sample in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev as well as the corresponding data for pp interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief description of our main version of the shm is given in sect .  2 .",
    "the experimental data selected for the analysis are summarized in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 the results of the analysis using the main version and alternative schemes of the shm are given . finally , in sect .",
    "5 we present and discuss the energy dependence of the chemical freeze - out stage .",
    "summary and conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the main idea of the shm is that hadrons are emitted from regions at statistical equilibrium , called clusters or fireballs .",
    "no hypothesis is made about how statistical equilibrium is achieved ; this can be a direct consequence of the hadronization process . in a single collision event",
    ", there might be several clusters with different collective momenta , different overall charges and volumes",
    ". however , lorentz - invariant quantities like particle multiplicities are independent of clusters momenta , while they depend on charges and volumes .",
    "if final state interactions among formed hadrons occur , particle multiplicities are frozen when inelastic interactions cease ( chemical freeze - out ) .",
    "thus , by analyzing measured hadron abundances , a snapshot is taken of clusters at that particular stage of the evolution , which may significantly precede the final kinetic freeze - out stage , when also elastic interactions cease .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that chemical and kinetic freeze - out may depend on the hadron species and the assumption of a single chemical freeze - out is certainly an approximation .",
    "most calculations in shm are carried out in the framework of the ideal hadron - resonance gas , that is handling resonances as free particles : this amounts to take a considerable part of the hadronic interactions between strongly stable hadrons into account @xcite .",
    "as has been mentioned , final multiplicities depend on the distribution of initial conserved charges ( baryon number , strangeness and electric charge ) among the produced clusters .",
    "this distribution is determined by the dynamics of the collision and is thus needed as an external input to the statistical model .",
    "however , most analyses , including ours , are carried out by assuming a single fireball .",
    "this is possible provided that one of the two conditions below is fulfilled :    1 .",
    "all clusters are large enough to allow a grand - canonical description and all of them have the same values of relevant intensive parameters , i.e. temperature and chemical potentials ; 2 .",
    "clusters are small and must be treated canonically ( i.e. counting those states having exactly the same charges as the cluster itself ) , yet they have the same temperature and the distribution governing fluctuations of charges is the same as that obtained by splitting one large cluster - the _ equivalent global cluster _",
    "egc - having as volume the sum of all clusters rest frame volumes and charges the sum of all clusters charges ( see appendix a ) . in this case",
    "the overall particle multiplicities turn out to be those calculated in the canonical , perhaps grand - canonical , ensemble of the equivalent global cluster @xcite .",
    "the reduction to egc could be achieved even for micro - canonical clusters with additional requirement on mass fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the first condition sets stronger requirements and applies in the bjorken s boost - invariant scenario , where all clusters are to have the same parameters independently of their rapidity .",
    "the second condition is altogether weaker and leaves room for the compatibility between the single fireball analysis and a variation of net baryon number density in rapidity .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the argument can be summarized as follows : particle multiplicities , being lorentz invariants , are unaffected by a shift in rapidity of the clusters ; therefore , clusters arising from the splitting of the egc can be ordered in rapidity according to their net baryon number without affecting fully integrated particle multiplicities and , at the same time , giving rise to an effective variation of the baryon density profile .",
    "although the second condition is certainly more appropriate in the examined energy range , from ags to sps , it must be pointed out that this should not be expected to precisely match physical reality , as well as the first condition in its domain of applicability . in other words , discrepancies",
    "( hopefully small ) between calculations based on this model and measurement are to be expected , so that these analyses shall not provide perfect fits even though the statistical model was the underlying true model .",
    "in this paper we will stick to the picture outlined in the second condition , which implicitely requires the use of full phase space multiplicities in order to ( hopefully ) integrating out correlations between clusters momenta and charges . besides their general fitness , @xmath3 multiplicities also allow to safely enforce overall strangeness neutrality .",
    "as has been mentioned , if the second condition applies , the multiplicity of any hadron @xmath4 can be calculated in the canonical ensemble of the egc .",
    "hence , as the egc has a much larger volume than single clusters , the grand - canonical ensemble , where charges are conserved on average , can be a good approximation ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this is the case for the collisions examined in this paper @xcite . in this case",

    "hadron multiplicity is as in eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) with the replacement : @xmath14",

    "the minimum mass @xmath18 is needed to open all decay modes .",
    "finally , the overall multiplicity to be compared with the data , is calculated as the sum of primary multiplicity ( [ mean ] ) and the contribution from the decay of heavier hadrons : @xmath19 where the branching ratios are taken from the latest issue of the review of particle physics @xcite and the summation runs over decays which contribute to the experimentaly measured multiplicity . among the hadrons and resonances contributing to the sum in eq .",

    "@xcite up to a mass of 1.8 gev are included ( see discussion in sect .  4 ) .",
    "what we have hitherto described is the main version of the shm used for the data analysis , that will be henceforth referred to as shm(@xmath1 ) . as has been mentioned in the introduction , in this work we also test other schemes and versions of the shm , which will be described in detail in sect .",
    "the bulk of the experimental data consists of measurements made by na49 collaboration in central pb - pb collisions at beam momenta of 30 , 40 , 80 and 158@xmath0 gev , corresponding to @xmath20 7.6 , 8.8 , 12.3 and 17.2 gev respectively .",
    "the acceptance region in rapidity and transverse momentum covers a typical range from midrapidity to projectile rapidity and from 0 to 1.5 gev/@xmath21 respectively .",
    "the overall hadron multiplicities , quoted in referenced papers , were obtained using forward - backward symmetry in rapidity and by extrapolating the yields to full phase space .",
    "all results were corrected for the feed - down from weak decays , e.g. @xmath22 multiplicity does not include pions produced in decays of @xmath23 hyperons and k@xmath24 mesons .",
    "central collisions were selected by a trigger using information from a downstream calorimeter , which measured the energy of the projectile spectator nucleons .",
    "whilst at 30 , 40 and 80@xmath0 gev all published results refer to the 7.2% most central collision sample , at 158@xmath0 gev different centrality selections ( 5% , 10% and 20% most central collisions ) were used to measure various hadronic species . in this analysis",
    "we have rescaled all published multiplicities at 158@xmath0 gev to the corresponding ones at 5% most central collisions assuming that for the considered central collisions the hadron yield is proportional to the mean number of participant nucleona .",
    "the resulting scaling factors are 1.08 and 1.32 for 10% and 20% most central collisions respectively @xcite .",
    "as far as ags data at 11.6@xmath0 gev is concerned , we have used both multiplicities measured by the experiments and extrapolations of measured rapidity distributions made in ref .",
    "@xcite at 3% top centrality .",
    "for @xmath23 we have made a weighted average of the multiplicities measured both at 5% top centrality by e896 @xcite and e891 @xcite .",
    "for the former , the quoted experimental error was only statistical so that we have added a 10% systematic error resulting in a value of 16.7@xmath250.5@xmath251.7 . for the latter , we have used the extrapolated value in ref .",
    "@xcite of 20.34@xmath252.74 .",
    "the error on the weighted average has been rescaled by 1.25 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) according to the pdg weighting method in case of discrepancy between different measurements @xcite .",
    "the obtained average has been rescaled by a factor 1.02 to convert it from 5% to 3% top centrality by assuming a linear dependence on the number of participants and by using the tables in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath27 to @xmath23 ratio has been measured only at midrapidity @xcite , we have obtained a @xmath28 4@xmath29 multiplicity assuming that the double ratio @xmath30 is the same at sps and ags energies . the final experimental multiplicities and ratios used in our analysis",
    "are shown in tables  [ ags ] , [ pbpb30 ] , [ pbpb40 ] , [ pbpb80 ] and [ pbpb158 ] .    in order to test the effect of the cut in rapidity on the resulting statistical model parameters ( discussed in detail in sect .",
    "4 ) we have also determined the yields integrated over limited ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) rapidity windows around midrapidity in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev . this has been done by fitting the rapidity distributions measured by na49 to a gaussian or the sum of two gaussians , with area and width as a free parameters and central values set to zero .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ yfit ] .",
    "the quality of the fits is quite good , except for pions due to a couple of points near midrapidity ; yet , this discrepancy does not affect significantly the integrated yield .",
    "in fact , it must be stressed that the main goal of these fits is to estimate an integral and not to reproduce accurately the shape of the distributions over the full measured range .",
    "we have also checked that the extrapolations to full phase space are in good agreement with published measurements .",
    "the analysis has been carried out by looking for the minima of the @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the multiplicity of the @xmath36 measured hadronic species and @xmath37 is the sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic experimental error .",
    "the theoretical multiplicities are calculated according to eq .",

    "the effect of the uncertainties on masses , widths and branching ratios of the involved hadrons on the fit parameters has been studied by the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to be negligible throughout .",
    "in order to cross - check our results and verify their robustness , we have performed the analysis with two independent numerical programs , henceforth referred to as a and b , which mainly differ with regard to the included resonances , their decay modes and branching ratios .",
    "the fitted parameters within the main scheme shm(@xmath1 ) are shown in table   [ parameters ] , while the experimental and fitted multiplicities , along with the predicted yields of several hadron species are shown in tables  [ ags ] , [ pbpb30 ] , [ pbpb40 ] , [ pbpb80 ] and [ pbpb158 ] and figs .",
    "[ agsf ] , [ pbpb40f ] , [ pbpb80f ] and [ pbpb158f ] .",
    "we do not show any plot for the fit in pb - pb collisions at 30@xmath0 gev because of the low number of data points .",
    "the quality of the fit is good throughout , as proved by the @xmath33 s values and we do not see any clear discrepancy between data and model , with the remarkable exception of the @xmath41 in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev . due the 5@xmath42 deviation from the statistical model prediction ,",
    "the measured @xmath41 yield has been removed from the fitted data sample as it could have biased the fit itself .",
    "we argue that this disagreement owes to its short lifetime ( @xmath43 mev ) compared with all other used particles .",
    "if the kinetic freeze - out occurs after some suitable delay from the chemical freeze - out , one can indeed justify the low measured @xmath41 yield as the effect of the elastic reinteractions of its decay products .",
    "the quality of the fits is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sqrts ] where the measured and fitted ratios and are plotted as a function of @xmath44 ; these ratios have been chosen as it has been proposed that their energy depedence plays an important role in the search for deconfinement onset at sps energies @xcite .",
    "the observed differences in the fit parameters between a and b are of the order of the fit errors . they may be considered as an estimate of the systematic error due to uncertainties in the implementation of the model .",
    "the first set of parameters in table  [ parameters ] have been obtained by using the full data , whilst the second set has been obtained by using the maximal common set of particles measured in the four collisions , that is @xmath45 , k@xmath46 , k@xmath47 , @xmath23 , @xmath28 and the participant nucleons ( net baryon number ) @xmath48 . by comparing fit results in the same analysis ( a with a and b with b )",
    ", it can be seen that the obtained parameters are in good agreement and only in one case a discrepancy larger than one standard deviation ( @xmath1 in pb - pb at 158@xmath0 gev ) is observed ; this demonstrates the robustness of the results .",
    "we have also included in tables  [ ags ] , [ pbpb30 ] , [ pbpb40 ] , [ pbpb80 ] and [ pbpb158 ] the prediction for the yield of the recently discovered @xmath49 pentaquark baryon ( uudd@xmath50 ) by using as input mass @xmath51 mev and @xmath52 . according to the shm(@xmath1 ) model , in the boltzmann limit",
    "this simply reads : @xmath53\\ ] ] if we disregard feeding from possible excited states .",
    "as the number of data points in pb - pb collisions at 30@xmath0 gev was not sufficient to determine the four free parameters unambiguously , we have forced @xmath9 to lie on the parabolic chemical freeze - out curve ( [ tmuparam ] ) in sect .  5 , interpolating the other four points in the @xmath54 plane .",
    "this method has proved to be able to provide unambiguous solutions for the remaining three free parameters .",
    "the first quoted error beside the best - fit value in table  [ parameters ] is the error coming out from the fitting program ( inferred from the analysis of the @xmath55 level contours ) whereas the second error is the fit error rescaled by a factor @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we deem that the latter is a more realistic uncertainty on the parameters with respect to the fit error because of the `` imperfect '' @xmath58 values , expected to be 1 on average if the model correctly matched physical reality . the argument , which is the same used in the particle data book @xcite when averaging discrepant data , is as follows :",
    "if @xmath59 , then the model can not reproduce the data at the level of accuracy relevant to the experimental errors ; on the other hand , this would be the case if experimental errors were larger and , particularly , if they were rescaled by a common factor @xmath60 so that : @xmath61 with this simple rescaling of the @xmath33 , the best - fit parameters would be unchanged , whereas their relevant errors would scale up by a factor @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the new covariance matrix @xmath62 for the parameter vector @xmath63 is related to the @xmath64 around the minimum through : @xmath65 also : @xmath66 and , being @xmath67 , one finds @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , since this covariance matrix would be the outcome of a standard quality fit , with @xmath69 , the errors rescaled by @xmath60 can be regarded as the sensible minimal uncertainty on the parameters .",
    "these rescaled errors have indeed been used in all of the plots in this paper .",
    "a major issue in the multiplicity fits is where to stop the inclusion of heavy light - flavoured resonances contributing to measured particle yields in eq .",
    "( [ branching ] ) .",
    "the relevance of this cut - off is owing to the peculiar shape of the hadron mass spectrum , which rises almost exponentially between 1 and 1.7 gev and drops thereafter probably due to the missing experimental information ( see fig .  [ spectr ] ) .",
    "should the number of states keep on increasing exponentially , the problem is set of the physical meaning of the obtained parameters , which could be heavily affected by the ignorance of further hadronic states .",
    "in fact , although the production of resonances decreases exponentially with the mass , the effect on secondary light particles through the decay chain could be balanced and even exceeded by the increasing number of states .",
    "we have thus checked the stability of the obtained parameters in the four collisions by varying the cut - off on the mass spectrum in a range where we are reasonably confident on the complete experimental knowledge and the number of states apparently rises exponentially ( i.e. up to 1.7 - 1.8 gev ) and repeating the fit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ stabil ] , the fitted @xmath9 , @xmath70 and @xmath1 in pb - pb at 158@xmath0 gev are indeed fairly constant from 1.3 to 1.9 gev .",
    "furthermore , the outcoming primary yields of some measured particles tend to saturate at cut - off masses of about 1.8 gev , implying that the contribution of resonance decays to secondaries ( needed to keep the final multiplicity close to the measured value ) settles down as well and the inclusion of heavier states yields a more and more negligible contribution .",
    "this is a clear indication of the significance of the fit results .",
    "a similar pattern occurs in all other examined collisions .",
    "a major result of these fits is that @xmath1 is significantly smaller than 1 in almost all cases ( with a possible exception at 30@xmath0 gev , see table   [ parameters ] ) , that is strangeness seems to be under - saturated with respect to a completely chemically equilibrated hadron gas .",
    "this confirms previous findings @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable interest and ongoing investigations about this deviation of the data from the fully equilibrated hadron gas , particularly motivated by the fact that strangeness production is considered as a possible qgp signature .",
    "it is therefore worth to examine and test , with the presently available large data sample , different scenarios which have been put forward to account for the under - saturation of strangeness .",
    "as we have seen , fits to full phase space multiplicities within the shm yield @xmath71 in most cases .",
    "however , good tests of the same model without extra strangeness suppression ( i.e. assuming @xmath72 ) have been obtained by fitting ratios of hadronic yields within a limited rapidity range around midrapidity at top sps energy @xcite .",
    "this is an appropriate method of estimating the parameters of the sources only if the boost - invariant bjorken scenario holds , at least as a good approximation , over a large rapidity interval ( say @xmath73 ) because , in this case , particle ratios at midrapidity are the same as in full phase space",
    ". however , rapidity distributions of hadrons at sps energies do not feature boost - invariance @xcite and a cut at midrapidity can artificially enhance heavy particle yield with respect to light ones ( see fig .",
    "[ rapid ] ) , as long as their kinetic freeze - out occurs at the same temperature and the leading baryon effect can be neglected . in the statistical model of a single fireball",
    "this can be easily understood , for the width of the rapidity distribution decreases as a function of mass according to ( in the boltzmann approximation ) : @xmath74\\ ] ] yet , it is worth testing the effect of the rapidity cut on measured distributions rather than using arguments based solely on the statistical model .",
    "therefore , we have fitted , within the scheme a , the integrated yields over limited rapidity windows measured in central pb+pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev by na49 ( see sect .  3 for details ) and",
    "quoted in table  [ deltay2 ] as well as the yields measured by wa97 @xcite over a @xmath31 window around midrapidity .",
    "we first note that , according to table  [ deltay2 ] , the integrated yields over @xmath31 measured by na49 and wa97 are in good agreement with each other . since the fit to the statistical model gave @xmath75 @xcite for wa97 data , the same is expected for the integrated na49 yields over the same rapidity window .",
    "this is indeed what we find , as shown in table  [ deltay ] .",
    "while temperature and baryon - chemical potential are essentially unchanged , the best - fit value of @xmath1 is closer to 1 than that obtained in full phase space in fit a ( see table  ( [ parameters ] ) and it is also compatible with 1 within the error .    we then conclude that the superfluity of @xmath1 in analysis of midrapidity particle yields , at least at top sps energy , is likely to owe to the artificial enhancement of strange particles with respect to lighter non - strange ones , induced by the cut on rapidity . the fact that @xmath75 for midrapidity yields is then not an indication of a fully equilibrated hadron gas at midrapidity ; even if such equilibrated fireball existed at the estimated kinetic freeze - out temperature of @xmath76 mev @xcite , the @xmath31 window would be too narrow for a correct estimation of chemical freeze - out parameters ( see fig .  [ rapid ] ) because lighter particles would be cut down significantly .      to account for the observed under - saturation of strangeness",
    ", a picture has been put forward in which strangeness is supposed to be exactly vanishing over distances less than those implied by the overall volume @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we henceforth refer to this version of the statistical model as shm(scv ) . following the description of the model in sect .  2",
    ", this means that the produced clusters or fireballs emerge with @xmath77 and they are not allowed to share non - vanishing net strangeness .",
    "assuming , for sake of simplicity , that all clusters have the same typical volume @xmath78 and that the equivalence of the set of clusters to a global fireball still applies for baryon number and electric charge ( but not to strangeness ) the following expression of the primary average multiplicities can be obtained ( see appendix b ) : @xmath79    \\frac{z_c(-ns_j)}{z_c(0)}\\ ] ] where @xmath80\\ ] ] is the so - called _ strange canonical partition function _ of a single cluster . as usual , in the above equations , the upper sign is for fermions and the lower for bosons .    if @xmath78 is sufficiently small , the multiplicities of strange hadrons turn out to be significantly suppressed with respect to the corresponding grand - canonical ones due to the enforcement of exact strangeness conservation in a finite system , an effect called _",
    "canonical suppression_. furthermore , the suppression features hierarchy in strangeness , namely it is stronger for @xmath40 ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath82 ) than for kaons and @xmath23 s , so it can be argued that this can account for the actually observed hierarchical pattern of extra strangeness suppression which goes like @xmath83 for open strange particles . the discriminating difference between this picture and our main scheme shm(@xmath1 ) described in sect .  2",
    "is concerned with hidden strange particles such as @xmath84 , which do not suffer canonical suppression , so that its theoretical multiplicity in shm(scv ) turns out to be simply the same as in a cluster with volume @xmath10 , that is given by the formula ( [ mean ] ) without @xmath85 suppression .",
    "we have made a test of this model by fitting the data sample of full phase space multiplicities in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev fixing @xmath86 and determining the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath70 and @xmath87 within the scheme a. the results are shown in tables  [ models ] and [ pbpb158 ] . the quality of the fit is worse with respect to the shm(@xmath1 ) model mainly because of the underestimated pion yield and the larger of @xmath84 .",
    "the latter is expected , as has been mentioned . as far as pion discrepancy",
    "is concerned , the deviation stems from the very fact that they are the only non - strange particles in the fit .",
    "the minimization procedure tries to accommodate the relative ratios among strange hadrons by fixing @xmath78 and @xmath9 , then it tries to set the overall normalization @xmath10 and at this stage a competition sets in between the set of strange and non - strange particles . since pions are only two entries , the fit prefers to keep them low rather than raising the whole set of strange particles .",
    "our result suggests that , for the local strangeness correlation to be an effective mechanism , the cluster volume should be of the order of 2.5% of the overall volume .",
    "otherwise stated , strange quarks should have not propagated beyond a distance of about 4 fm from the production point up to chemical freeze - out , if we take the overall volume of about 3 10@xmath88 fm@xmath88 as coming out from this fit where hadrons are pointlike particles .      in this picture , henceforth referred to as shm(tc ) , the observed hadron production is approximately the superposition of two components ( tc ) : one originated from one large fireball at complete chemical equilibrium at freeze - out , with @xmath86 , and another component from single nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "in fact , according to simulations based on transport models , a significant fraction of beam nucleons interacts only once with target nucleons @xcite . with the simplifying assumption of disregarding subsequent inelastic collisions of particles produced in those primary nn collisions",
    ", the overall hadron multiplicity can be written then as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the average multiplicity of the @xmath5 hadron in a single nn collision , @xmath92 is the mean number of single nn collisions giving rise to non - re - interacting particles and @xmath93 is the average multiplicity of hadrons emitted from the equilibrated fireball , as in eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) , with @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath91 term can be written in turn as : @xmath94 since it is known that in nn collisions strangeness is strongly suppressed @xcite the idea is to ascribe the observed under - saturation of strangeness in heavy ion collisions to the nn component , leaving the central fireball at complete equilibrium , i.e. with @xmath86 .",
    "of course , this is possible provided that @xmath95 is sufficiently large .",
    "this production mechanism has probably some consequences on the final rapidity and momentum distributions of the different species , whose calculation goes certainly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we have confined ourselves to integrated multiplicities and tried to fit @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath70 of the central fireball and @xmath92 by using na49 data in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev within the scheme a.    to calculate @xmath91 we have used the statistical model and fitted pp full phase space multiplicities measured at @xmath96 gev ( i.e. the same beam energy ) by the same na49 experiment . for np and nn collisions , the parameters of the statistical model determined in pp are retained and the initial quantum numbers are changed accordingly .",

    "the new parametrization described in ref .",
    "@xcite has been used in which one assumes that some number of pairs , poissonianly distributed , hadronizes ; the extra strangeness suppression parameter @xmath1 is thus replaced by the mean number of these pairs , @xmath97 .",
    "+ the results of the fit are shown in table  [ pp160 ] along with fitted and predicted hadron multiplicities , including the @xmath98 pentaquark baryon , and in fig .",
    "[ pp160f ] .",
    "the temperature value is significantly higher than in pp and collisions at higher energy , an effect already observed for center - of - mass energies below 20 gev @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that this is a possible indication of a beginning inadequacy of the canonical ensemble at low energy , where exact conservation of energy and momentum should start to play a significant role .",
    "perhaps this is the point where the microcanonical hadronization of each cluster is a more appropriate approach .",
    "the results of the fit to pb - pb collisions are shown in table  [ models ] . the fit quality , as well as the obtained values of @xmath9 , @xmath70 , are comparable to the main fit within the shm(@xmath1 ) model .",
    "the predicted number of `` single '' nn collisions is about 50 with a 16% uncertainty .",
    "thus , only 260 nucleons out of 360 contribute to the formation of large equilibrated fireballs .",
    "the percentage of primary hadrons stemming from nn collisions varies from 14% for pions to 27% of @xmath99 s and protons and to 0.5% of @xmath40 s .",
    "it should be pointed out that the fitted parameters are affected by a further systematic error owing to the uncertainty on the parameters of the statistical model in nn collisions , which are used as an input in the pb - pb fit . however , because of exceeding computing time needs , it has not been possible to assess these errors .    in a simple geometrical picture ,",
    "the single - interacting nucleons are located in the outer corona of the portion of colliding nuclei corresponding to the observed number of participants .",
    "as the projected ( on the collision s transverse plane ) radial nucleon density is : @xmath100 where @xmath101 @xmath102 is the nucleon density and @xmath103 fm is the radius of the portion of colliding nucleus corresponding to a participant number of 180 , the 50 single - interacting nucleons should lie between 4.84 and 6.45 fm .",
    "this simple estimate is in approximate agreement with the calculations performed with the glauber model @xcite .",
    "since the number of single - interacting nucleons is expected to be weakly dependent on center - of - mass energy , the fits to this two - component model should yield consistent values of @xmath92 at 30 , 40 and 80@xmath0 gev collisions .",
    "however , no measurement of hadron production in nn collisions at those energies is available and this question can not be tackled for the present .",
    "an extension of the statistical model has been proposed where qgp hadronization is essentially a statistical coalescence of quarks occurring at an energy density value which does not correspond to a hadron gas at equilibrium @xcite . in this model",
    "two non - equilibrium parameters are introduced for the different types of quarks , @xmath104 for u , d quarks and @xmath105 for strange quarks ( the difference between @xmath105 and @xmath1 is explained below ) .",
    "the multiplicity of each hadron thus reads : @xmath106\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number of valence s quarks and @xmath107 the number of valence u , d quarks ; @xmath108 and @xmath109 are as in eq .",

    "( [ mean ] ) it can be realized that the introduction of a light - quark non - equilibrium parameter amounts to introduce in the statistical model an overall enhancement ( or suppression ) of baryons with respect to mesons , unlike in the model shm(@xmath1 ) .",
    "we henceforth refer to this model as shm(@xmath113 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath104 has a definite physical bound for bosons which can be obtained by requiring the convergence of the series @xmath114 for any value of the energy . if the number of u , d quarks to be hadronized is so large that @xmath104 is to attain its bounding value , a bose condensation of particles in the lowest momentum state sets in . for low strangeness and electrical chemical potentials , such as those found in the present analysis ,",
    "the bounding value is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the neutral pion mass , e.g. @xmath117 for @xmath118 mev .    with the introduction of @xmath104 as an additional free parameter , there are 5 parameters to be determined in the model .",
    "this makes the minimization procedure rather unstable because it becomes easier to be trapped in local minima . to avoid this",
    ", we have performed 4 parameter fits with fixed values of @xmath104 varying from 0.6 to 1.7 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "this method allows a clearcut determination of the absolute minimum .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ gammaq ] in terms of the minimum @xmath33 obtained for fixed @xmath104 .",
    "the round dots show the minimum @xmath33 s achieved by using the main sample of multiplicities in pb - pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev . we find a steady decreasing trend in the value of best - fit temperatures varying from @xmath119 mev at @xmath120 to @xmath121 mev at @xmath122 .",
    "the fitted temperature at @xmath123 reaches the upper limit of 200 mev , which is the maximum allowed in the model to prevent from being critically dependent on the hadron mass spectrum cut - off . on the other hand , the best - fit values of @xmath124 and @xmath1 are rather stable and about the same found in the main fit with @xmath125 .",
    "the number of terms in the series ( [ meangq ] ) has been truncated to 5 for all particles ; the contribution of further terms has been found to be negligible throughout .",
    "it is seen that the absolute @xmath33 minimum falls in the region of pion condensation , marked by a vertical line at @xmath126 , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 mev .",
    "this finding is in agreement with what is found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , there is also a local minimum at the lower edge @xmath120 , with a temperature of 187 mev , which is only one unit of @xmath33 higher than the absolute minimum .",
    "this indicates that the absolute minimum could be rather unstable against variations of the input data and this is in fact what we find by varying down the pion multiplicities by only 1 @xmath42 . for this case , the minimum @xmath33s",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ gammaq ] as triangular dots and the absolute minimum now lies at @xmath120 instead of at the pion condensation point .    in view of the instability of the fit , and of the small _",
    "relative _ @xmath33 improvement in comparison with the main fit , we conclude that there is so far no evidence for the need of this further non - equilibrium parameter . however , it is interesting to note that this model predicts an enhanced ( if @xmath129 ) or suppressed ( if @xmath130 ) production of the @xmath49 pentaquark baryon with respect to the other versions of the statistical model , even though they agree in reproducing the multiplicities of all other hadrons .",
    "this is owing to an additional @xmath131 factor for this special hadron having five valence quarks . from eqs .",

    ", we stress that minimum @xmath33 fits are very useful tools to get information on the state of the source at chemical freeze - out , but , as already emphasized in sect .  3 ,",
    "the simple multiplicity analysis with global parameters resides on an idealization of the collision ( e.g. the assumed existence of an egc ) which can not _ exactly _ fit physical reality and discrepancies are to be expected anyway .",
    "thus , a new mechanism or of a modification of the basic scheme proves to be relevant only if it leads to a major improvement of the agreement with the data .",
    "slight improvements of the @xmath33 , whenever their significance is beyond its expected statistical fluctuations , can not be seriously taken as a proof of the validity of a particular scheme .",
    "the statistical model does not make any prediction on the energy dependence of hadron production ; its relevant parameters have to be determined separately for each energy and reaction type .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of the data within this model may help in the study of energy dependence of hadron production because it effectively reduces the full experimental information on numerous hadron yields to only few parameters .",
    "clearly this reduction should be taken with care , were not for the approximate validity of some relevant assumptions , such as the reducibility to egc ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , the reduction procedure may remove or dilute essential physical information . with these caveats in mind , in this section we discuss the energy dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters extracted from the data ( by using the full data sets ) within our main shm(@xmath1 ) approach .",
    "the chemical freeze - out points in the @xmath54 plane are shown in fig .",
    "the rhic point at @xmath133 gev , obtained fitting particle yield ratios at midrapidity , has been taken from ref .",
    "the four points at beam energies of 11.6 , 40 , 80 and 158@xmath0 gev have been fitted with a parabola : @xmath134 where @xmath9 and @xmath70 are in gev .",
    "the pb - pb point at 30@xmath0 gev has been forced to lie on the above curve , as has been mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the rhic point calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite is in good agreement with the extrapolation of the curve ( [ tmuparam ] ) .    in the search for deconfinement phase transition ,",
    "strangeness production is generally believed to be a major item , especially if an anomalous abrupt change was found as a function of centre - of - mass energy or other related quantities .",
    "a possible indication of it in pb - pb collisions at the low sps energies was reported on the basis of the observed energy dependence of several observables @xcite .",
    "particularly , the ratio shows a peaked maximum at about 30@xmath0 gev .",
    "one may expect that this anomaly should be reflected in the energy dependence of @xmath1 parameter fitted within shm(@xmath1 ) scheme .",
    "this dependence is plotted in fig .",
    "[ gs ] and in fact a maximum shows up at 30@xmath0 gev .",
    "although the error bars are large enough so as to make @xmath1 seemingly consistent with a constant as a function of centre - of - mass energy , it is important to note that the dominant systematic errors on experimental data at sps energies are essentially common . therefore , the errors on the model parameters at different sps energies turn out to be strongly correlated , hence fitted @xmath1 s are expected to move up or down together .    in order to further study strangeness production features ,",
    "we have also compared the the measured ratio ( including the preliminary rhic result at @xmath135 gev @xcite ) with the theoretical values in a hadron gas along the freeze - out curve ( [ tmuparam ] ) as a function of the fitted baryon - chemical potential for different values of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ kpi ] ) . the calculated dependence of on @xmath70 is non - monotonic with a broad maximum at @xmath136 mev ( i.e. @xmath137 gev ) @xcite . taking into account that systematic errors at different energies in pb - pb collisions are fully correlated , we can conclude that the data points seem not to follow the constant @xmath1 lines .",
    "in fact , the anomalous increase of relative strangeness production at 30@xmath0 gev can be seen also in the wroblewski variable @xmath138 , the estimated ratio of newly produced strange quarks to u , d quarks at primary hadron level , shown in fig .",
    "[ ls ] and table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the calculation of newly produced quark pairs is performed by using the statistical model best fit values of the various hadron multiplicities , so the obtained @xmath139 values are somehow model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , this variable features a very similar behaviour as the ratio and attains a maximum value of 0.61 at 30@xmath0 gev , very close to that predicted for @xmath86 .",
    "these deviations from a smooth behaviour of strangeness production are certainly intriguing , yet the analysis within the shm will be more conclusive in this regard with a larger data sample at 30@xmath0 gev and at the forthcoming 20@xmath0 gev data .",
    "we presented a detailed study of chemical freeze - out conditions in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at projectile momenta of 11.6 ( au - au at ags ) , 30 , 40 , 80 and 158@xmath0 ( pb - pb at sps ) gev , corresponding to nucleon - nucleon centre of mass energies of 4.8 , 7.6 , 8.8 , 12.3 , 17.2 gev respectively . by analyzing hadronic multiplicities measured in full phase space within the statistical hadronization model ,",
    "we have tested and compared different versions of this model , with special emphasis on possible explanations of the observed strangeness under - saturation at the hadron level .",
    "it is found that version of the model referred to as shm(@xmath1 ) , where a non - equilibrium population of hadron carrying strange valence quarks is allowed , fits all the data analyzed in this paper .",
    "we have also shown that the seeming full chemical equilibrium found for central pb+pb collisions at 158@xmath0 gev by using particle yields integrated over a limited region around mid - rapidity is most likely an artefact of the kinematical cut .",
    "we have tested a model ( shm(tc ) ) in which hadron production is pictured as stemming from two independent components : a fireball ( or a set of fireballs ) at full chemical equilibrium and single nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "this model can fit the data at 158@xmath0 gev if the number of collisions is around 50 with a sizeable uncertainty .",
    "so far , it can not be confirmed at other energies due to the lack of the precise data on nn interactions .    a model in which strangeness",
    "is assumed to vanish locally @xcite yields a worse fit to the data with respect to shm(@xmath1 ) and shm(tc ) .",
    "finally , we have also tested a model in which it is allowed a non - equilibrium population of hadrons carrying both strange and light valence quarks .",
    "we have found the present set of available data does not allow to establish whether a further non - equilibrium parameter is indeed needed to account for the observed hadron production pattern .",
    "a discriminating prediction of this model with respect to the shm(@xmath1 ) is an enhanced production of the recently discovered @xmath49 pentaquark baryon due to the additional factor @xmath140 .",
    "energy dependence of chemical freeze - out parameters has been discussed based on the results obtained with our main version of the model shm(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the evolution of the freeze - out temperature and baryon - chemical potential is found to be smooth in the ags - sps - rhic energy range .",
    "the strangeness - suppression parameter @xmath1 is found to smaller than one ( @xmath141 ) for most of the studied collisions which confirms previous findings @xcite , with an indication of a maximum at 30@xmath0 gev , where @xmath1 is found to be close to one .",
    "the significance of this maximum is related to the correlation between errors on hadron yield measurements at different energies .",
    "the interpolated dependence of relative strangeness production on energy and baryon - chemical potential , as measured by the ratio and the wroblewski factor @xmath139 , features a broad maximum at about 30@xmath0 of beam energy .",
    "however , the experimental measurement of and the estimated @xmath139 value in pb - pb collisions at this energy seemingly exceed the expected values for a fixed @xmath1 .",
