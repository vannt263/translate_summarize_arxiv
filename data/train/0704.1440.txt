    "a quasiperiodic structure can be described as a cut through a hyperlattice decorated with atomic surfaces . as a consequence",
    "the atoms are arranged in a finite number of different local environments frequently leading to a substructure of highly symmetric clusters .",
    "the cluster positions can again be modelled by a simpler decoration consisting in the simplest case of exactly one atomic surface ( for the cluster centre ) per hyperlattice unit cell .",
    "the displacement of the cut space ( phasonic displacement ) is a discrete degree of freedom , called phasonic degree of freedom .",
    "it can be excited locally , leading to a rearrangement of the clusters by correlated atomic jumps .",
    "this view is supported by recent diffraction data of coherent phason modes in i(cosahedral)-alpdmn @xcite and by in situ observations of phason jumps via high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) in d(ecagonal)-alcuco @xcite .",
    "the cut formalism can not be applied directly if there is a gradient in the phasonic displacement .",
    "this is examplified by the extreme case of a cut space running inbetween all atomic surfaces and not touching any of them .",
    "hence we resort to another method : we substitute the atomic surfaces by atomic hypervolumes @xcite of the same dimension as the hyperspace . for the construction two different spaces",
    "are needed : those atomic hypervolumes that are cut by the ( possibly deformed ) cut space @xmath6 are selected .",
    "the centre of each selected atomic hypervolume is projected onto the projection space @xmath7 . by shearing the cut space , i.e. by introducing a linear phasonic displacement ,",
    "periodic approximants are created .",
    "phasonic degrees of freedom also can exist in these and play a fundamental role for phase transitions @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss linear defects , metadislocations , in the phasonic degree of freedom for approximants of the alpdmn system .",
    "this system is especially adequate for the examination of phasonic degrees of freedom since a stable i - phase , a stable 1.2  nm d - phase , a metastable 1.6  nm d - phase ( which is assumed to be a solid solution of mn in d - alpd @xcite ) , and a large variety of approximants have been observed in the phase diagramm @xcite .",
    "all of them , as well as several binary alpd and almn quasicrystals and approximants are related structurally .",
    "a hyperspace model for i - alpdmn has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "it uses a six dimensional face - centred hyperlattice @xmath8 with lattice constant @xmath9  nm and serves as a starting point since to our knowledge all newer , more complicated hyperspace models are refinements .",
    "it has been shown , that the approximants @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite of the 1.6  nm d - phase and the approximants @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite of the 1.2  nm d - phase are described on an atomistic level by a shear in this model .",
    "however the authors had to introduce an additional mirror symmetry to assure full tenfold symmetry .",
    "the main building units are mackay - type clusters , whose centres are projected from the hyperspace by using one atomic surface per hyperlattice unit cell . it is a subset of a triacontahedron , deflated by @xmath10 with respect to the canonical triacontahedron , which is the projection of the hypercube with edge length @xmath11 on the orthogonal complement of @xmath7 .",
    "the distance of the cluster centres is the shortest projection of neighboring @xmath8-sites @xmath12 multiplied by the deflation factor : @xmath13  nm .    the relation of the approximants to the i - phase is given by two consecutive shears of @xmath6 in the hyperspace : the first shear changes the cluster arrangement in direction of a fivefold axis @xmath14 . together with the introduction of a mirror plane",
    "this results in a decagonal quasicrystal .",
    "the clusters are then aligned in columns parallel to the tenfold axis , so that the structures can be described by two - dimensional tilings , which are the projections in the column direction .",
    "the second shear rearranges the columns perpendicular to @xmath14 .",
    "we will now consider the tilings for the 1.6  nm and the 1.2  nm phases separately .",
    "inflated ttt .",
    "( c ) the tiles can be substituted with penrose rhomb tiles .",
    "the substitution is different for the 1.6 nm phases and the 1.2 nm phases .",
    "[ fig : tilings],height=680 ]    neighboring clusters in the 1.6  nm d - phase and its approximants lie on planes perpendicular to @xmath14 . thus the tile length is @xmath15 as defined above .",
    "the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-phase are built from flattened hexagons ( h ) arranged in parallel and in alternated orientation respectively . by introducing additional rows of pentagons ( p ) and nonagons ( n ) between each @xmath16 rows of alternated hs in the @xmath1-phase",
    "we obtain the @xmath2-phases .",
    "such a pn - row is called a phason plane , which is justified since it is elongated in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "as we will see , phason planes play an important role for the cluster reshuffling resulting from an excitation of the phasonic degree of freedom .",
    "further tiles , the decagon ( d ) and an u - shaped tile ( u ) are observed in the 1.6  nm d - phase ( fig .  [ fig : tilings ] ( a ) ) .",
    "neighboring clusters in the 1.2  nm d - phase and its approximants lie on two planes staggered perpendicular to @xmath14 with distance @xmath17  nm . the resulting tile length is @xmath18  nm . the @xmath3- and the @xmath4-phase are built from elongated hexagons ( h ) arranged in parallel and in alternated orientation respectively .",
    "the @xmath5-phases are created by introducing into the @xmath4-phase additional rows of boat - shaped tiles ( b ) between each @xmath19 rows of alternated h s .",
    "a b-row is again called a phason - plane . for the 1.2  nm d",
    "- phase additionally a decagon ( d ) and a star - shaped tile ( s ) are needed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] ( b ) ) .    by substituting the h , p , n , h , and b tiles with acute rhombs ( ar ) , ( ar ) and obtuse rhombs ( or ) , ( or ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilings ] ( c ) we obtain new tilings for the approximants , which can be interpreted as approximants of the penrose - tiling .",
    "an h is substituted by an or , while a phason plane corresponds to a combination of an ar - row and an or - row .",
    "so the @xmath2-phase has @xmath19 or - rows inbetween neighboring ar - rows .",
    "similarly the @xmath5-phase has @xmath19 ar - rows inbetween neighboring phason planes , represented by or - rows .",
    "the rhombs occuring in the new tilings for the @xmath20-approximants ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , as well as for the @xmath4-approximants ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) both only need three of the five basis vectors of the penrose - tiling to be constructed .",
    "therefore the tilings can be modelled in a simple three - dimensional hyperspace with the @xmath21-lattice and lattice constant @xmath22  nm .",
    "the projection matrices are ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 leading to an edge length of the tiles : @xmath26  nm . there is one atomic hypervolume per unit cell , which is just the unit cell , and one phasonic degree of freedom . this three - dimensional hyperspace is the simplest model for a phasonic degree freedom besides the fibonacci - chain .",
    "in the formalism of atomic hypervolumes a dislocation can be introduced into a tiling by a generalised voltera process @xcite .",
    "it is uniquely characterised by a translation vector of the hyperlattice , the burgers vector @xmath27 ( here : @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , that splits up into a phononic component @xmath30 ( deforming the tiles ) and a phasonic component @xmath31 ( rearranging the tiles ) .",
    "the latter can only be calculated from the full six - dimensional katz - gratias model .",
    "if it is not zero , such a dislocation is a partial dislocation . by ( i ) extending the linear theory of elasticity to the hyperspace , ( ii ) approximating the phasonic degree as continuous , and ( iii ) assuming isotropy in the strain fields ,",
    "the line energy @xmath32 of a dislocation is expressed as : @xmath33    besides a phononic contribution with material constant @xmath34 and a phasonic contribution with @xmath35 , a coupling term is present with @xmath36 . according to experiment we assume @xmath37 . since stable dislocations are those with the lowest energy",
    ", we have to minimise @xmath38",
    ". we will discuss this in parallel for dislocations in the @xmath20- and the @xmath4-approximants . the minimization yields @xmath39 in both cases .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 . here",
    "we approximate @xmath44 by the fractions @xmath45 and @xmath46 by the fractions @xmath47 respectively .",
    "@xmath48 are the fibonacci numbers with start values @xmath49",
    ". finally the burgers vectors of stable dislocations are : @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "interestingly they correspond to the same six - dimensional burgers vectors : @xmath52 hence it suffices to consider both cases together for the rest of our calculations .",
    "the phononic component @xmath53 is perpendicular to the phason - planes ( in the vertical direction in fig .  [",
    "fig : tilings ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath54 and @xmath55 . substituting this into ( [ eq : energy ] )",
    ", we have @xmath56\\tau^{-3}(t^{3d})^2 $ ] .",
    "there is a minimum for @xmath57 .",
    "this determines the burgers vector with lowest energy for given values for the material constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "however it has to be noted that these are not necessarily identical for the @xmath20- and the @xmath4-approximants .",
    "- ( left ) and the @xmath58-phase ( right ) with @xmath59 metadislocations .",
    "@xmath60 new phason planes are inserted from the left , ending at the triangular shaped dislocation core .",
    "[ fig : meta],width=566 ]    tilings of the @xmath61- and the @xmath58-phase with @xmath59 dislocations have been calculated ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meta ] ) .",
    "they show large rearrangements of the tiles due to the phasonic component @xmath31 and negligible deformations of the tiles due to the smaller phononic component @xmath62 .",
    "the dislocations are also dislocations in the metastructure of the phason planes",
    ". therefore @xcite , who discovered these dislocations in hrtem images of the @xmath63-phase , named them metadislocations .",
    "the fact , that the experimentally most often observed metadislocations are those with @xmath59 suggests @xmath64 .",
    "we do not know of burgers vector determinations or observations of metadislocations in the @xmath4-approximants , but dislocations with the burgers vectors ( [ eq : burgers ] ) are also the ones most often observed in the i - phase @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath2- and the @xmath5-phases the phasonic degree of freedom is related to the movement of the phason planes .",
    "since there are no phason planes in the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , @xmath3- , and @xmath4-phase , the phasonic degree of freedom can not be excited locally .",
    "however metadislocations can exist in the @xmath1- and the @xmath4-phase , but not in the @xmath0- and the @xmath3-phase .",
    "it can be shown , that there is no consistent way to introduce dislocations with phasonic components in the latter phases .    a motion of the metadislocation ( like the motion of any dislocation in a quasicrystal or large unit cell approximant ) is necessarily accompanied by diffusion in the form of tile rearrangements .",
    "the motion is possible by climb in direction of the phason planes or by glide perpendicular to them . during the climb motion",
    "new phason planes are created ( or dissolved ) behind the dislocation core .",
    "a large number of metadislocations moving through the @xmath1- or @xmath4-phase could even lead to a phase transformation to the @xmath2- or @xmath5-phases making the phasonic degree of freedom continously excitable .",
    "this is affirmed by hrtem images of phase boundaries between the @xmath1- and the @xmath63-phase formed by metadislcations @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "glide motion does not change the number of phason planes . at least in the @xmath1- and the @xmath4-phase glide motion seems unprobable , since the phason planes running out of the dislocation core would have to be dragged along , while climb motion only needs a reconstruction of the tiling near the dislocation core .",
    "( similar arguments leading to the same conclusion , as well as newer experimental work are presented in @xcite . )",
    "we have to note , that there are no direct observations of metadislocation motion in approximants yet , although in the i - phase dislocations with identical burgers vectors have been shown by in - situ observations to move by climb @xcite ."
