    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are evolved massive stars possessing a strong stellar wind .",
    "interaction of the wr wind with the material lost during the preceding evolutionary phase results in the origin of a compact circumstellar nebula ( e.g. chevalier & imamura 1983 ; robberto et al . 1993 ; brighenti & dercole 1995 ) .",
    "the majority of wr circumstellar nebulae is associated with late wn - type ( wnl ) stars ( gvaramadze et al . 2009 and references therein ) , i.e. with stars that only recently entered the wr phase ( e.g. moffat , drissen & robert 1989 )",
    ". these nebulae could be sources of mid- and far - infrared ( ir ) emission ( e.g. mathis et al . 1992 ; hutsemekers 1997 ; marston et al .",
    "1999 ) and can be detected with the modern ir surveys .",
    "barniske et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found circumstellar emission from dust and gas around two extremely luminous wn stars near the galactic center .",
    "the detection of compact nebulae reminiscent of nebulae associated with known wnl and luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars might suggest that their central stars are evolved massive stars as well and could be used for selection of candidate wnl , lbv or related stars for spectroscopic follow - ups .",
    "the importance of this channel for search for evolved massive stars was pointed out by gvaramadze et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who reported the discovery of a ring nebula in cygnus ( using the archival data from the cygnus - x spitzer legacy survey ; hora et al . 2009 ) and the results of spectroscopic follow - up of its central star , showing that the star belongs to the wn8 - 9h subtype .",
    "inspired by this discovery , we searched for more ring nebulae in the archival data of the _ spitzer space telescope _ and found dozens of objects ( gvaramadze , kniazev & fabrika 2009 ; cf .",
    "carey et al.2009 ) .    in this paper , we present the results of study of one of the stars selected via detection of their circumstellar nebulae .",
    "our spectroscopic follow - up of this star showed that it is a wr star of the wn7h subtype , which provides a further proof of the effectiveness of our method for revealing massive post  main - sequence stars .",

    ". the signatures of a second incomplete concentric shell are indicated by three arrows .",
    "an arclike filament ( surrounded by a rectangle ) at @xmath8 to the north of the nebula is the south rim of the supernova remnant 3c391 . ]",
    "the new nebula in aquila was discovered in the archival data of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) within the framework of the 24 and 70 micron survey of the inner galactic disk with mips ( mipsgal ; carey et al .",
    "the mips @xmath9 m image of the nebula ( see fig.[fig : neb ] ) shows a perfect circular shell with a diameter of @xmath10 arcmin .",
    "one can see also signatures of a second incomplete concentric shell of diameter of @xmath11 arcmin and some structures within the main shell ; it is not clear , however , whether they are related to the nebula .",
    "the region containing the nebula was also covered by the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ) carried out with the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , the multi - array galactic plane imaging survey ( helfand et al .",
    "2006 ) , the supercosmos h - alpha survey ( shs ; parker et al . 2005 ) and partially by _",
    "observations of the ( background ) supernova remnant 3c391 ( located at @xmath12 arcmin to the north of the ir shell ) . none of these observations nor the mips @xmath13 m data show signatures of the nebula .",
    "fig.[fig : neb ] also shows a point source located exactly in the centre of the nebula , which suggests that this source might be associated with the nebula .",
    "the details of the source are summarized in table[tab : obs ] . the coordinates and the @xmath14 magnitudes",
    "are taken from the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the photometric v and i magnitudes of the optical counterpart to the ir central source were determined on a ccd frame obtained with the sbig ccd st-10xme attached to the 40-cm meade telescope of the cerro armazones astronomical observatory of the northern catholic university ( antofagasta , chile ) during our observations in 2009 april .",
    "the accuracy of the measurements is @xmath15 mag in both filters .    to measure the _ spizer _ s irac and mips fluxes from the star",
    ", we performed its aperture photometry using the mopex / apex source extraction package and applied an aperture correction obtained from nearby bright point sources .",
    "the estimated errors are @xmath16 per cent . for the flux at @xmath17 m",
    ", we give a @xmath18 upper limit since the star was not detected at this wavelength .",
    ".details of the central star ( wr121b ) associated with the new nebula in aquila [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "wr121b , like the majority of wr stars , is located outside of known star clusters .",
    "since most of massive stars originate in a clustered mode of star formation ( e.g. zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) , it is natural to assume that wr121b ( or its progenitor star ) was ejected from the parent cluster either through a dynamical process in the core of the cluster ( poveda et al .",
    "1967 ; gies & bolton 1986 ) or due to a supernova explosion in a close massive binary system ( blaauw 1961 ; stone 1991 ) .",
    "the first process could start to operate at the very beginning of cluster evolution , while the second one only several myr after the cluster formation , when the most massive stars in binaries ( and respectively in the cluster ) end their lives as supernovae . in both cases",
    ", the ejected wr star should not be far from its parent cluster since the progenitors of wr stars are very massive ( @xmath19 ) and therefore short - lived ( @xmath20 myr ) stars .",
    "proceeding from the aforementioned , we searched for known young star clusters around wr121b using the simbad and webda databases and found that this star is located at @xmath21 degree from a cluster deeply embedded ( @xmath22 mag ) in the giant hii region w43 ( see fig.[fig : w43 ] ) .",
    "this cluster ( named in the simbad database as ` [ bdc99 ] w43 cluster ' ) contains at least three evolved massive stars ( blum , damineli & conti 1999 ) , two of which are o - type giants or supergiants and the third one is a wn7+a / ob",
    "? star ( wr121a ) .",
    "the large ionizing flux of the w43 star forming region ( @xmath23 lyman continuum photons @xmath24 ; smith , biermann & mezger 1978 ) is comparable with that of the very massive star cluster ngc3603 , which suggests that the central cluster in w43 contains a large number of yet undetected massive stars and therefore should be effective in producing runaway stars ( e.g. gvaramadze 2009 ; gvaramadze , gualandris & portegies zwart 2008 , 2009 ) . on the other hand , the presence of the wnl star in the cluster implies that the age of the cluster is comparable to the evolutionary age of wr121b .",
    "it is plausible , therefore , to identify the origin of wr121b ( or its progenitor star ) with the central cluster of w43 .     @xmath25 m image of the hii region w43 and its environments obtained in the _ midcourse space experiment _ galactic plane survey ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) , with the position of the star cluster embedded in w43 marked by a white circle and the positions of wr121b and als9956 indicated by diamond points .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "m image of als9956 ( marked by a circle ) and its bow shock .",
    "_ right _ : shs image of the same field .",
    "orientation of these images is the same as for fig.[fig : w43 ] . ]",
    "this conjecture is also supported from the distance to wr121b of @xmath26 kpc which we have obtained in section [ sec : dist ] . for w43 a distance of about 7kpc was derived from hi radio measurements and a galactic rotation model ( wilson et al .",
    "1970 ) , which for the modern value of the distance to the galactic centre reduces to about 5.6 kpc ( blum et al .  1999 ) .",
    "blum et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained 5.7 kpc from two o stars observed in w43 when assuming that they are giants .",
    "thus , within the error margins the distances are consistent .    with a luminosity of @xmath27 ,",
    "the current and the initial masses of wr121b are @xmath1 and @xmath28 , respectively , and its evolutionary age is @xmath29 myr . the latter estimate and the angular separation between wr121b and w43 ( @xmath6 degree , which for @xmath30 kpc corresponds to the linear separation of @xmath31 pc ) implies that the minimum allowed peculiar ( transverse ) velocity of wr121b is @xmath32 .",
    "we predict , therefore , the ` observed ' ( i.e. not corrected for the galactic rotation and the solar motion ) proper motion of wr121b of @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( if the star was ejected @xmath29 myr ago ) or @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( if the the ejection occurred @xmath21 myr ago ) .",
    "[ these estimates were derived using the galactic constants @xmath37 kpc and @xmath38 ( e.g. reid 1993 ; avedisova 2005 ) and the solar peculiar motion ( @xmath39 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) . ] proper motion measurements for wr121b are necessary to prove the association between this star and the star forming region w43 and thereby to constrain some of its inferred fundamental parameters .    to find the evidence that the [ bdc99 ] w43 cluster loses its massive stars",
    ", we searched for bow shock - like structures in its environments using the mipsgal survey . the visual inspection of mips 24@xmath40 m images results in the discovery of a bow shock produced by the o9.5iii star als9956 ( see fig.[fig : bow ] ) , located at @xmath41 degree from the cluster ( see fig.[fig : w43 ] ) .",
    "the bow shock has an obvious optical counterpart in the shs .",
    "the orientation of the symmetry axis of the bow shock and the evolutionary age of the star of @xmath42 myr are consistent with a possibility that als9956 was ejected from the cluster in w43 ( cf .",
    "gvaramadze & bomans 2008 ) .    further support to",
    "this possibility comes from comparison of the ( photometric ) distance to als9956 with the distance to the cluster .",
    "als9956 has the @xmath43 and @xmath44 magnitudes of , respectively , 11.83 and 11.25 ( kharchenko 2001 ) . using the extinction law from rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) and the synthetic photometry of galactic o stars by martins & plez ( 2006 )",
    ", we derived extinction towards als9956 of @xmath45 mag and estimated the distance to this star to be 6.2 kpc , i.e. similar to the distance to the cluster .    using the vizier catalogue access tool ,",
    "we searched for proper motion measurements for als9956 and found that all existing measurements are insignificant ( i.e. the measurement uncertainties are comparable to the measurements themselves ) and , therefore , can not be used to prove unambiguously our hypothesis that the star was ejected from w43 .",
    "still , taken at face value , they suggest that als9956 is a runaway star moving away from the galactic plane towards growing galactic latitude ( which is consistent with the position of the star above the galactic plane ) , while the direction of stellar motion inferred from the symmetry of the bow shock ( see , e.g. , gvaramadze & bomans 2008 ) is well within the stellar proper motion error cone .",
    "we note that the visual extinction towards als9956 and wr121b is much smaller than that towards the [ bdc99 ] w43 cluster .",
    "if both stars were indeed ejected from the cluster , then we conclude that some ob stars can be detected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaway stars , while their cousins residing in the parent clusters might still remain totally obscured .",
    "this may explain why some field o - type stars show no apparent association with star clusters [ cf .",
    "de wit et al .",

    "we have discovered a new wnl ( wn7h ) star via detection of a circular ir nebula ( typical of evolved massive stars ) and spectroscopic follow - up of its central star .",
    "this discovery provides further evidence that the circumstellar nebulae associated with wr stars are inherent almost exclusively to wr stars of the wnl subclass .",
    "it also shows that the ir imaging could be an effective tool for revealing wnl and related evolved massive stars .",
    "the new wnl star is one of many dozens of ( candidate ) evolved massive stars revealed via their association with compact ir nebulae , detected in the mips @xmath46 m data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ archive .",
