    "the discovery of neutrino masses via their flavor oscillations over long baselines constitutes the first solid evidence of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics @xcite .",
    "while this is an important first step toward a deeper understanding of nature , it poses many more questions than it answers .",
    "a number of theoretically well - motivated models have been proposed and explored to address the origin of the neutrino mass but , strictly speaking , these represent only a handful out of an infinite set of possibilities .",
    "the question of how well future experiments can probe and distinguish different scenarios arises naturally and is quite relevant given the current state of high energy physics .",
    "the coming years promise detailed explorations of the terascale with the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the more distant international linear collider ( ilc ) or variants thereof .",
    "expectations are that combined information from these two facilities , coupled with high precision , low energy results and cosmological observations will shed light on some of the current mysteries of physics , including that of the neutrino mass .    here",
    ", we concentrate on the possibility that the neutrino masses are generated at some high energy scale @xmath0 where @xmath1 , the only non - anomalous global symmetry of the standard model , is broken .",
    "such a scenario is well - motivated by the observed properties of the light neutrinos including tiny masses , large mixings and the fact that neutrinos are the only electrically neutral fundamental fermions .",
    "more specifically , once @xmath1 is broken , neutrinos are not protected from getting non - zero majorana masses after electroweak symmetry breaking . on the other hand , since the renormalizable minimal standard model higgs boson representations , such as higgs boson triplets . ]",
    "preserves @xmath1 , @xmath2 breaking effects will only manifest themselves at low energies through higher dimensional operators .",
    "this being the case , one generically expects neutrino masses to be suppressed with respect to charged fermion masses by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the higgs boson vacuum expectation value .    by further assuming that all new degrees of freedom are much heavier than the weak scale , we are guaranteed that , regardless of the details of the new physics sector , all phenomena below the weak scale are described by irrelevant , higher dimensional operators . in this spirit , the observable consequences of all high energy models that lead to small majorana neutrino masses can be catalogued by understanding the consequences of irrelevant operators that break @xmath2 by two units . with this in mind , we will survey all such non - renormalizable effective operators for phenomenological signatures at future and current experiments .",
    "we restrict ourselves to operators that will lead to lepton number violation ( lnv ) , as these will be directly connected to the existence of small majorana neutrino masses .",
    "this means that we do not consider operators that conserve @xmath6 but violate @xmath7 , and hence also @xmath2 , by two units ( such operators lead to , for example , neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillations ) , nor do we include operators that respect @xmath2 .",
    "most of the time , the latter will not mediate any observable consequences for large enough @xmath0 , except for operators of dimension - six and above that can mediate proton decay .",
    "to begin , we systematically name and classify all relevant lnv operators .",
    "fortunately , this has already been done in @xcite up to and including operators of mass dimension eleven . for each operator",
    "we then calculate / estimate the analytic form of the radiatively generated neutrino mass matrix . upon setting this expression equal to the experimentally measured neutrino masses ,",
    "we extract the energy scale @xmath0 associated to the new lnv physics .",
    "armed with these scales , we proceed to calculate each operator s phenomenological signatures at a variety of experimental settings .",
    "additionally , having explicitly calculated the operator - induced neutrino mass _ matrices _ , we may also verify , under some generic assumptions , whether one can account for the observable lepton mixing pattern .",
    "after such a general survey , one is adequately equipped to take a step back and select phenomenologically / theoretically interesting operators for further detailed study by `` expanding '' effective vertices to reveal particular ultraviolet completions . in this way",
    ", one can use the results presented here as a means of systematically generating renormalizable models with well - defined experimental predictions .",

    "[ sec : interesting ] , we highlight a number of `` interesting '' operators , defined by low cutoff scales and prominence of experimental signatures , which are still allowed by current constraints on lnv . we undertake a slightly more detailed discussion of their characteristics and signatures and present some sample ultraviolet completions .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] with a summary of our assumptions and results , augmented by commentary on future prospects for lnv searches .",
    "our results are tabulated by operator name in table  [ tab : allops ] for easy reference .",
    "we hope that this analysis will prove useful to various audiences on a number of distinct levels . in the most superficial sense ,",
    "the casual reader should note the general features of lnv as well as the diversity of model variations .",
    "such information is best expressed in terms of the operator distribution histograms scattered throughout the text .",
    "these are color - coded by operator dimension or cutoff scale , and typically contain additional information , including current experimental prospects . on the more technical side ,",
    "those interested in specific neutrino mass generating models will find detailed , operator specific , information that may be utilized as crude model predictions .",
    "additionally , as already alluded to , one may even `` hand - pick '' operators for model development based on specific phenomenological criteria . finally , we urge experimentalists to search for new physics in all accessible channels .",
    "it is our ultimate goal to provide motivation for experimental considerations of non - standard lnv effects , beyond neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "here we analyze @xmath10 invariant @xmath11 non - renormalizable effective operators of mass dimension up to and including eleven .",
    "they are composed of only the sm field content as all other , presumably heavy , degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "as already emphasized , we do not allow for the existence of sm singlet states ( right - handed neutrinos ) or any other `` enablers '' of renormalizable neutrino masses , such as higgs @xmath12 triplet states .",
    "we therefore assume that all lepton number violation originates from new ultraviolet physics and that neutrino masses are generated at some order in perturbation theory .    a @xmath13-dimensional operator @xmath14 is suppressed by @xmath15 powers of a mass scale @xmath0 that characterizes the new physics , in addition to a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath16 : @xmath17 where we sum over all possible flavor combinations that make up the same `` operator - type , '' as defined below .",
    "for each operator , @xmath18 is approximately the maximum energy scale below which the new perturbative ultraviolet physics is guaranteed to reside , and @xmath0 is used as a hard momentum cutoff in the effective field theory . among all @xmath13-dimensional operators ,",
    "we define @xmath0 so that the largest dimensionless coupling @xmath16 is equal to unity .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we will assume that all other @xmath16 are of order one .    in the first two columns of table [ tab : allops ]",
    ", we exhaustively enumerate all possible lepton number violating operators of mass dimension less than or equal to eleven . all together , this amounts to 129 different types of operators , most of which , 101 to be exact , are of dimension eleven and consist of six fermion and two higgs fields .",
    "remaining are 21 , 6 and 1 operator of dimension nine , seven , and five , respectively .",
    "the dimension - nine operators can be of two different kinds , as defined by their respective field content .",
    "they either contain four fermion and three higgs fields or simply six fermion fields with no higgs field content . for consistency",
    ", we use the notation of reference @xcite , where such a listing was first introduced .",
    "our operator naming scheme is also derived from the same list , which we trivially extend to include @xmath19 elements only mentioned in that analysis .",
    "these are the dimension - nine and dimension - eleven lnv operators that can be constructed from the `` product '' of the previously listed dimension - five and dimension - seven operators with the sm yukawa interactions .",
    "we individually identify those operators with the same field content but different @xmath12 gauge structure with an additional roman character subscript added onto the original designation from @xcite .",
    "this is done in order to render our discussion of the various operators clearer , since specific gauge structures can play an important role in the derived energy scale and predictions of a given operator .",
    "note that we neglect effective operators that contain sm gauge fields , since , as argued in @xcite , these are not typically generated by renormalizable models of new physics .",
    "our notation is as follows .",
    "@xmath20 are the left - handed lepton and quark @xmath12 doublets , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the charge - conjugate of the @xmath12 singlet right - handed charged lepton and quark fermion operators , respectivelty .",
    "conjugate fields are denoted with the usual `` bar '' notation ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we are omitting flavor indices , but it is understood that each matter fermion field comes in three flavors .",
    "all matter fields defined above are to be understood as flavor eigenstates : all sm gauge interactions , including those of the @xmath27-boson , are diagonal . without loss of generality",
    ", we will also define the @xmath6 and @xmath21 fields so that the charged - lepton yukawa interactions are flavor - diagonal .",
    "we take the @xmath12 doublet higgs scalar to be @xmath28 and assume that , after electroweak symmetry breaking , its neutral component acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of magnitude @xmath29  tev , is distinct from many treatments of the sm where @xmath5 is taken to be @xmath30 .",
    "these are equivalent up to a factor of @xmath31 and are both valid provided a consistent treatment of the interaction lagrangian . ]",
    "thus spontaneously breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath32 . in table",
    "[ tab : allops ] , the components of the @xmath12 doublets are explicitly listed and labeled with @xmath33 . in order to form gauge singlets ,",
    "operators are contracted either by the antisymmetric tensor @xmath34 , defined such that @xmath35 , or by trivial contractions with a conjugate doublet field .",
    "different gauge contractions are partially responsible for the wide variety of operator structures encountered in this study .    in order to avoid unnecessarily messy expressions",
    ", several features are missing from the operators as listed in table [ tab : allops ] .",
    "to begin , @xmath36 color indices are suppressed in these expressions .",
    "color contractions are only implied here because @xmath36 is an unbroken symmetry of the sm and hence there is no sense in distinguishing the various quark field components .",
    "we assume that the parent ultraviolet completion to each operator treats the color gauge symmetry properly by introducing appropriately chosen heavy colored particles to render the theory gauge invariant .",
    "slightly more serious is the omission of flavor indices to label the fermion generations . for most of this analysis ,",
    "we assume that all new physics effects are generation universal and thus , flavor independent .",
    "this is not guaranteed to be the case , as is painfully obvious within the sm .",
    "one will also note that , depending on the @xmath37 structure of the effective operator , different flavor - dependent coefficients will be strictly related .",
    "for example , including flavor dependent couplings @xmath38 , @xmath39 should read @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( symmetric ) for all @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath43 should read ( for fixed @xmath44 and @xmath23 flavors ) @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ( antisymmetric ) for all @xmath42 .",
    "large differences among the various flavor structures of each operator may very well exist .",
    "flavor is an important facet of lnv phenomenology , and is addressed where relevant within the text .",
    "the final feature missing from our notation is explicit lorentz structure",
    ". each operator must , of course , form a lorentz scalar , but there are numerous field configurations that can bring this about .",
    "the higgs field is a scalar , and as such , transforms trivially under the lorentz group and is thus of no relevance to this discussion .",
    "the fermions , however , transform non - trivially and their contractions must be accounted for in each operator .",
    "simple combinatorics dictate that there are at most @xmath47 such possibilities for the six - fermion operators that comprise the bulk of our sample , 3 in the four - fermion case and only @xmath48 for the lone dimension five operator .",
    "additionally , each contraction can be made in a variety of ways , corresponding to the bilinear dirac operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 $ ] of the scalar , vector and tensor types , respectively .",
    "since we are dealing with chiral fields , the addition of the @xmath52 matrix to form the pseudoscalar and axial - vector bilinears is redundant . while this helps reduce the number of possibilities , the task of listing , categorizing , and analyzing all possible lorentz structures for each operator is still quite overwhelming and is not undertaken in this general survey",
    "fortunately , different lorentz structures for the same operator - type lead to the same predictions up to order one effects .",
    "this is especially true for the `` interesting '' operators characterized by tev @xmath0 scales .",
    "we shall quantify this statement and mention specific structures when relevant .",
    "that being said , the lorentz structure of an effective operator can suggest a lot of information about its parent renormalizable model .",
    "for example , it can suggest the spin of the heavy intermediate states and the forms of various vertices .",
    "armed with these operators , we can calculate the amplitude of any @xmath53 lnv process .",
    "it is important to emphasize that when addressing the phenomenological consequences of any particular operator @xmath54 , we assume that it characterizes the dominant tree - level effect of the new heavy physics , and that all other effects  also characterized by other lnv effective operators of lower mass dimension  occur at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "our approach is purely diagrammatic , in that we begin with an operator - defined vertex and then proceed to close loops and add sm interactions as needed to yield the correct external state particles . in this sense",
    ", special care must be taken to respect the chiral structure as defined by each operator . in order to reach the intended external states , to couple to particular gauge bosons , or to close fermion loops ,",
    "one must often induce a helicity flip with a sm mass insertion .",
    "we express these inserted fermion masses in terms of the respective yukawa couplings , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and the higgs vev , @xmath5 . the higgs field can be incorporated into this procedure in a number of ways .",
    "we treat the two charged and single neutral nambu - goldstone higgs bosons , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , within the feynman-t hooft gauge as propagating degrees of freedom with electroweak scale masses .",
    "the physical neutral higgs , @xmath59 , can be either chosen to propagate as a virtual intermediate state , or couple to the vacuum with amplitude @xmath5 .    in order to avoid the task of explicitly evaluating a huge number of multiloop feynnman diagrams",
    ", we succumb to approximate lnv amplitudes based on reasonable assumptions and well - motivated rules .",
    "our methodology is motivated by exact computations with one - loop , dimension 7 operators where the work is analytically tractable , as well as on general theoretical grounds . for select operators ,",
    "we have also checked our assumptions against predictions from ultraviolet complete models with success . in order to perform a particular calculation",
    ", we draw the appropriate diagram(s ) , taking care that no momentum loop integral vanishes by symmetry reasons .",
    "this step is potentially quite involved , as multiple diagrams can give sizable amplitude contributions depending on the characteristic energy transfer in the system , not to mention the cumbersome dirac algebra within the respective loops . given the high , often super - tev , mass scale associated with our calculations , it is often convenient to work in the gauge field basis where each boson state is associated with a single sm group generator , as is natural before electroweak symmetry breaking . in a similar sense , all fermions , including those of the third generation , are taken to be massless to zeroth order .",
    "all masses are included perturbatively where needed via mass insertions . at first",
    "guess , it would seem that our results are only valid in the rather subjective limit @xmath60 . by direct comparison with other more complete approximations , however , we find that our predictions are very reasonable at all scales above @xmath61 .",
    "keeping all of this in mind , we apply the following `` rules '' to obtain approximate amplitude expressions .    1 .",
    "_ trivial numerical factors _ : a number of numerical factors can be read off trivially from the feynman diagrams .",
    "specifically , one can extract the presence of the suppression scale @xmath62 directly from the dimension @xmath13 operator , as well as the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath16 .",
    "generally , @xmath16 is a generation dependent quantity , but for lack of any experimental evidence to the contrary , we take @xmath63 universally unless stated otherwise . in the case of scenarios already constrained by current data , we will relax this assumption to `` save '' the operator and comment on the phenomenological consequences of the change .",
    "+ furthermore , various factors of the electroweak scale @xmath5 may be extracted from the operator s higgs field content , in addition to fermion / gauge boson mass terms . in this way",
    ", we may also include the various yukawa and gauge coupling factors @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath64 , respectively , where @xmath65 runs over the three sm gauge groups .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the gauge subscript @xmath65 in further analytic expressions .",
    "finally , a color factor of @xmath66 associated with each quark loop should also be included in our computations , but can ( and will ) be neglected for simplicity from algebraic expressions where order one factors are irrelevant and only serve to render expressions more cumbersome .",
    "we note that all coupling constants are subject to renormalization group running .",
    "in particular , those occurring within a loop should be evaluated at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "we neglect this order one effect since it is most important at large @xmath0 scales where operators tend to have less of a phenomenological impact due to the @xmath67 suppression .",
    "2 .   _ loop factors _ : in all of our calculations , we assume that each operator defines an effective field theory , characterized by the scale @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that all momentum integrals are effectively cut off at @xmath0 , above which new states will emerge to regularize the theory .",
    "divergences in such loops tend to cancel the large scale suppressions inherent to the bare operators , and thus enhance predicted lnv rates .",
    "specific divergences can be determined by simple power counting of momentum factors .",
    "of course , multiple loop integrals are often convoluted to the point where substantial simplification is needed to determine the dominant divergent term .",
    "such a complication is in part due to the numerator of the dirac propagators , which include single momentum factors and must therefore be present in pairs to contribute effectively to an ultraviolet divergence . the process of adding loops to induce @xmath0 power law divergences should only be pursued to the point where the suppression of the induced effective term is no less than @xmath68 .",
    "any further divergent contribution must be treated as a renormalization to lower order terms , and hence , can only add small finite corrections to the total amplitude . in any case , those diagrams with the smallest scale suppressions are not always the most dominant , as will become clear later when we discuss specific results .",
    "+ in addition to power - law divergences , each loop is also associated with a numerical suppression factor .",
    "this arises from the proper normalization of the loop four - momentum integral as a factor of @xmath69 , the characteristic phase space `` volume '' of a quantum state .",
    "it allows one to view the integral as a coherent sum over all possible intermediate configurations in a consistent way . partially evaluating these integrals for a number of examples ,",
    "one quickly finds that two powers of @xmath70 cancel with the four dimensional euclidian space solid angle @xmath71 .",
    "we introduce a suppression factor of @xmath72 for each diagram loop , which tends to offset enhancements from associated divergent factors .",
    "a quadratically divergent loop diagram is often proportional to the lowest order contribution times @xmath73 to the power @xmath74 ( number of loops in the diagram ) . this contribution is larger than the leading order one if @xmath75 for any number of loops",
    "the situation is often more involved , as many loops turn out to be logarithmically divergent or even convergent .",
    "the important conclusion is that adding loops is not an efficient way to enhance lnv rates at the low scales accessible to future experiments .",
    "this fact is demonstrated by example in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] .",
    "+ finally , as already alluded to , many diagram loops will exhibit logarithmic divergences , as is the standard case in renormalizable theories involving fermion and vector fields .",
    "this occurrence typically reflects the differences between the two characteristic scales inherent to the system , namely @xmath0 and @xmath5 , and are of the general form @xmath76 for some power @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath77 is a small , loop suppressed , dimensionless coupling coefficient . numerically , these logarithms are much softer than their quadratically divergent counterparts seen elsewhere in the diagrams and can safely be neglected .",
    "3 .   _ intermediate states _ : we treat all virtual intermediate states , outside of loops , as if they carry the characteristic momentum of the interaction @xmath44 and neglect dirac structure , unless stated otherwise . in particular ,",
    "goldstone bosons are assigned the propagator @xmath78 and fermions are assigned @xmath79 . in the case of an intermediate neutrino",
    ", this reduces to a simple factor of @xmath80 for all realistic @xmath44 values .",
    "hence , for very low energy processes ( @xmath81  mev ) , neutrino exchange diagrams tend to dominate lnv rates .",
    "lorentz structure _ :",
    "for the purposes of our analysis , we assume that all lorentz contractions between fermions are scalar - like .",
    "as previously mentioned , the absolute magnitude of most lnv amplitudes is robust under this assumption up to order one factors .",
    "the only qualitative exception to this occurs in some cases involving fermion bilinear terms with a tensor lorentz structure ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "this factor , when coupled between two fermions contracted in a loop , will yield a vanishing rate due to its antisymmetry inside of a trace , since @xmath83 .",
    "this can be bypassed by introducing a new momentum vector into the trace , implying the addition of another loop . in most cases ,",
    "this is most efficiently accomplished with a new gauge boson line , which is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence .",
    "the combination of both factors leads to a marginal amplitude suppression ( with respect to the same operator where all fermion bilinears are lorentz scalars ) for all energies of interest .    with these approximations in hand",
    ", it is a simple matter to estimate the amplitude associated to any given diagram .",
    "still , one must wonder about the uncertainty induced onto the calculations by such varied assumptions .",
    "can results obtained by such methods supply valid physical predictions ?",
    "the answer , of course , depends on the question that is being asked . here",
    ", we will only be interested in estimating order of magnitude effects , including what value of @xmath0 is required in order to explain the observed neutrino masses and , once @xmath0 is so constrained , what is the order of magnitude of other related observable effects .",
    "one may wonder whether a more detailed estimate of the effects of each individual operator would lead to more reliable results .",
    "the answer is negative .",
    "it is easy to show that different renormalizable theories that lead to the same effective operator at tree - level will mediate different processes at the loop - level with order one different relative strengths .",
    "furthermore , the derived cutoff scales inherit the uncertainty from the absolute value of the heaviest neutrino mass , which is only loosely bounded between @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the extracted atmospheric mass squared difference @xcite and tritium beta decay kinematic measurements @xcite .",
    "this is an order of magnitude uncertainty that can not be avoided even if one were to perform a detailed computation within a well - defined ultraviolet complete theory .    in summary , given all approximations and uncertainties ,",
    "our results are only valid up to @xmath86 an order of magnitude . in this spirit , one need not explicitly consider order one factors that will necessarily yield negligible corrections by these standards . such a large error tolerance supplies the need for care when interpreting results . in particular , one should not place too much emphasis on any one bound or prediction , unless it is very robust , _",
    "i.e. _ , able to withstand variations of at least a factor of ten . of course , for those operators constrained by several different independent sources one can , and should , take more marginal results seriously .",
    "having defined the set of lnv operators , we now extract the scale of new physics from the direct comparison of radiatively generated neutrino mass expressions to their observed values . since there are three light neutrino masses , we will use the heaviest of these to set the overall mass scale .",
    "neutrino oscillation data , currently providing the only evidence for neutrino masses , constrain the relative magnitudes of the mass eigenstates but not the overall scale @xcite . such data only supply a lower bound on the heaviest neutrino mass , derived from the largest observed mass squared difference @xmath87 , the atmospheric mass squared difference @xcite .",
    "at least one neutrino mass must be greater than @xmath88  ev .",
    "neutrino oscillations also teach us that the next - to - heaviest neutrino weighs at least @xmath89  ev ( the solar mass - squared difference ) , in such a way that the ratio of the heaviest to the next - to - heaviest neutrino masses is guaranteed to be larger than , approximately , 0.2 .",
    "no lower bounds can be placed on the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "an upper bound on the heaviest neutrino mass is provided by several non - oscillation neutrino probes .",
    "cosmology provides interesting constraints on the sum of light neutrino masses , but these are quite dependent on unconfirmed details of the thermal history of the universe and its composition @xcite .",
    "most direct are kinematic measurements of the tritium beta decay electron endpoint spectrum @xcite . both types of probes provide upper bounds near @xmath85 , likely to improve in coming years .",
    "we choose to perform our calculations assuming the mass scale @xmath90  ev , corresponding to the experimental lower bound . in this way , each extracted operator scale @xmath0 , inversely related to the neutrino mass , represents a loose upper bound . since most rates for lnv observables are proportional to some inverse power of @xmath0 , this choice implies the added interpretation that , all else remaining equal , our results for such rates should conservatively reflect lower limit predictions",
    ".    lnv neutrino masses are nothing more than self - energy diagrams evaluated at vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "these must couple together the left - handed neutrino state @xmath91 with the right - handed anti - neutrino state @xmath92 , as shown schematically in diagram @xmath93 of fig .",
    "[ fig : massdiagrams ] . here",
    "the flavor indices @xmath94 and @xmath95 can accommodate any of the three lepton flavors ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the derived majorana masses @xmath96 are generally complex .",
    "the large grey circle in this diagram represents all possible contributions to the neutrino mass .",
    "specifically , it contains the underlying @xmath53 operator along with all modifications needed to yield the correct external state structure .",
    "this includes such objects as loops , additional gauge boson propagators and sm coupling constants .",
    "generally , several diagrams can contribute to this mass generation , but special care must be taken that these are not proportional to any positive power of @xmath44 , the momentum carried by the neutrino legs , as this would not lead to a nonzero rest mass correction .     is representative of all operators that can generate the needed external state neutrinos .",
    "this usually proceeds via loop contractions and other couplings , hidden within the light gray region .",

    "all of these generate effective dimension - five interactions of calculable strength .",
    "see the text for more details . ]",
    "diagrams @xmath97 of fig .",
    "[ fig : massdiagrams ] are examples that serve to illustrate some typical features encountered in our effective operator induced self - energy calculations .",
    "the underlying lnv operators shown in each diagram contain six fermion fields and are therefore of dimension nine or eleven , as are the majority of the analyzed operators .",
    "each of these diagrams generates an effective dimension - five interaction @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a generation dependent coupling constant that is calculable , given the structure of the original operator .",
    "this is easily verifiable via direct power counting , despite differences in dimension , loop number , field content , and helicity structure .",
    "it turns out that most operators , especially those characterized by super - tev scales , possess this property .",
    "we describe each sample diagram in turn to point out important features .",
    "a subset of the subtleties described below is encountered when estimating the neutrino masses @xmath100 for the entire effective operator set .",
    "diagram @xmath101 is a simple two - loop radiatively generated mass term proceeding from dimension - nine operators , such as @xmath102 , containing the fermion structure @xmath103 , where the fields @xmath104 and @xmath105 are contracted into loops with mass insertions that supply the needed field chirality flip .",
    "masses arising from such operators are proportional to two powers of fermion yukawa couplings . strictly speaking , allowed fermions from all three generations traverse the closed loops and contribute to the mass . however , assuming universal new physics coupling constants , third generation fermions will strongly dominate the induced neutrino mass . in cases such as these , one can freely suppress couplings to the lighter two generations without modifying the expected value of @xmath0 .",

    "hence , non - zero neutrino masses only appear at a higher order in perturbation theory ( _ i.e. _ , we need to add another loop ) . to maintain the chiral structure of the diagram",

    "unfortunately , being an @xmath12 singlet , @xmath124 only couples to the neutrino via a charged higgs induced yukawa interaction ; therefore , this amplitude must be proportional to the product @xmath125 to yield a legitimate neutrino mass contribution .",
    "one might imagine that the higgs fields contained in the lnv operator could be used to produce the needed neutrino legs , but this is not possible since the resulting loop would have a structure of the form @xmath126 which vanishes in the `` rest mass '' limit .",
    "it is clear that both higgs fields must again couple to the vacuum and the needed flip must come from the other fermion loops .",
    "the resulting loop integrals can be separated into two convoluted pieces corresponding to both loop / leg pairs .",
    "a little thought reveals that each loop set contains three fermion lines whose associated integral is again proportional to the momentum of the external neutrino , and thus is not a valid mass correction . to fix this last problem without further complicating the chiral structure",

    "tab : allops ] , we list the most favorable modes of experimental observation for each operator .",
    "the different relevant probes are : neutrinoless double - beta decay ( @xmath139 ) , neutrino oscillation and mixing ( mix ) , direct searches for new particles at the lhc ( lhc ) and ilc ( ilc ) , and virtual lnv effects at collider facilities ( helnv ) .",
    "we find it unlikely that other probes of lnv , including rare meson decays , should yield a positive signal in the forseeable future .",
    "this conclusion is strongly based on the fact that , for all of our analysis , we assume that _ all _ new physics degrees of freedom are heavier than the weak scale . while the vast majority of operators is most sensitive to searches for neutrinoless double - beta decay , that is not true of all operators . some lead to relatively suppressed rates for @xmath139 ( mostly because they lead to mass matrices with a very small @xmath515 ) even if they are associated to @xmath828  tev , indicating that , for these scenarios , we are more likely to observe the physics behind neutrino masses directly at colliders than to see a finite lifetime for @xmath139 .",
    "other scenarios naively lead to @xmath139 rates orders of magnitude higher than what is currently allowed by data .",
    "if these are responsible for the generation of neutrino masses , the new physics is constrained to be somewhat decoupled from first generation quarks ( for example ) . in this case , there is hope that lnv phenomena at colliders , which are not restricted to first generation quarks , occur with non - negligible rates .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ tab : allops ] lists the current `` status '' of the operator as either experimentally unconstrained ( u ) , constrained ( c ) , or disfavored ( d ) .",
    "such labels are assigned based only on the experimental probes reviewed in this work . by arbitrary convention",
    ", an ` unconstrained ' operator can safely accommodate all existing data even if one assumes _ all _ its flavor - dependent dimensionless coefficients to be of order one .",
    "a ` constrained ' operator can accommodate all existing data after one allows some of the different flavor - dependent dimensionless coefficients to be suppressed with respect to the dominant ones by a factor of 100 or so ( as described above ) . ` disfavored ' operators can only accommodate all data only if `` tuned '' much more severely than the ` constrained ' ones , and are usually in trouble with more than one `` type '' of constraint .",
    "a glance at column six reveals that 11 out of the 129 operators are disfavored by current data .",
    "the most stringent constraints come from @xmath139 , while all ` disfavored ' operators are associated to cutoffs at or below @xmath491 .",
    "three of the ` disfavored ' operators , @xmath686 , @xmath687 , and @xmath688 , are also in disagreement with the neutrino oscillation data ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : oscillations ] ) .",
    "our results illustrate that , as far as `` explaining '' neutrino masses , the model - building scene is wide open even if one postulates that neutrino masses arise as a consequence of lepton number violating , `` heavy '' physics .",
    "significant progress will only be achieved once more experimental information becomes available .",
    "the observation that neutrinoless double - beta decay occurs with a nonzero rate will help point us in the right direction , but will certainly not reveal much about the mechanism behind neutrino masses . a more complete picture can only arise from combined information from several observables , including other lnv observables and the search for new physics at the electroweak scale .",
    "other important experimental searches , not discussed here , include all lepton - number conserving `` leptonic '' probes , such as precision measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , searches for leptonic electric dipole moments , searches for charged - lepton flavor violation , and precision measurements of neutrino  nucleon and neutrino  lepton scattering .",
    "jj would like to thank michael schmitt for useful insight into the experimental feasibility of some of these analyses , as well as the members of the argonne national laboratory theory group for help in identifying limitations to our assumed operator set .",
    "adg is indebted to kai zuber for discussions on the relevance of probes of lepton number violation beside @xmath139 .",
