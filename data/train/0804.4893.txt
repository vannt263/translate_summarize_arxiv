    "forward particle production in proton - nucleus collisions allows one to investigate the non linear qcd dynamics of high - energy nuclei with a probe well understood in qcd .",
    "indeed , while such processes are probing small - momentum ( small@xmath3 ) partons in the nuclear wavefunction , only high - momentum partons of the proton contribute to the scattering .",
    "for instance , in the case of two - particle production , the longitudinal fraction of momenta probed in the proton ( @xmath4 ) and in the nucleus ( @xmath5 ) are given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xmath10 are the transverse momenta and rapidities of the final state particles .",
    "therefore , with @xmath11 and forward rapities @xmath12 the process features @xmath13 and @xmath14 meaning that the scattering involves a well - known dilute hadron @xmath15 and dense nuclear target @xmath16 whose non - linear qcd dynamics can be studied .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework was quite successful in describing single inclusive particle production at forward rapidities in d+au collisions at rhic @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on forward inclusive two - particle production @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 detected in the proton direction , and in particular on correlations in azimuthal angle between the produced hadrons @xcite .",
    "we argue that the second d+au run at rhic gives the opportunity to carry out these measurements , and check the relevance of the cgc picture of high - energy nuclei at rhic energies .    in the following ,",
    "the @xmath17 cross - section is derived and used in the context of d+au collisions to predict the azimuthal angle distribution .",
    "the kinematic ranges for forward particle measurements at rhic are such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 therefore the dominant partonic subprocess is initiated by valence quarks in the proton and , at lowest order in @xmath22 the @xmath17 cross - section is obtained from the @xmath23 cross - section , the quark density in the proton and the appropriate hadron fragmentation functions .    by contrast , the nucleus @xmath16 whose partons with small fraction of momentum ( mainly gluons ) are described by a cgc , can not be described by a single gluon density .",
    "the @xmath24 cross section is instead expressed in terms of correlators of wilson lines ( which account for multiple scatterings ) , with up to a six - point correlator @xcite . assuming a gaussian cgc wavefunction allows to express all the correlators in terms of a single function @xmath25 related to the variance of the gaussian distribution @xcite . in the large@xmath26 limit",
    ", the non - linear qcd evolution at small@xmath27 is included through the balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) evolution @xcite of @xmath28 .",
    "the cross - section for the production of the quark - gluon dijet ( with respective transverse momenta @xmath29 and @xmath30 and rapidities @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) then reads @xcite : @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 the different components in ( [ cs ] ) are :    * the quark distribution function in the proton @xmath36 ( we are working with @xmath37 ) ; in principle the gluon initiated processes @xmath38 and @xmath39 should also be included , they would contribute for smaller values of @xmath40 * the fourier transform of the two - point ( dipole ) correlator @xmath41 also called the unintegrated gluon distribution function , given by @xmath42 contrary to the dilute proton , the cgc can not be described only by its gluon distribution @xmath41 the @xmath43factorization formula is not applicable @xcite ( it would if there was no other @xmath5 dependence in ( [ cs ] ) , as in single gluon production @xcite ) . *",
    "the @xmath43factorization breaking terms ( whose simple form is due the use of a gaussian cgc wavefunction ) @xmath44 with @xmath45 as the valence quark emits the virtual gluon ( the associated wavefunction is @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 are polarization and spin indices ) it interacts coherently with the dense small@xmath3 gluons in @xmath16 which modifies the @xmath50 splitting .    in practice",
    ", the initial condition @xmath51/4 $ ] is used with the choice @xmath52 and the initial saturation scale @xmath53 then @xmath28 is evolved with the bk equation , allowing to compute ( [ gdis ] ) , ( [ split ] ) and the cross - section ( [ cs ] ) .",
    "we will now use the inclusive two - particle spectrum ( [ cs ] ) to investigate the process @xmath54 with @xmath55 in particular we shall study the @xmath56 spectrum where @xmath57 is the difference between the azimuthal angles of the measured particles @xmath18 and @xmath58 we will study the normalized @xmath56 distribution @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the transverse momenta of the measured hadrons and @xmath62 and @xmath10 are their rapidities .",
    "we take into account both situations where either the quark or the gluon fragments into the most forward hadron . our results do not include convolution with fragmentation functions which should be done eventually , however we except this has little impact on the observable we are considering here ; for @xmath63spectra this would be not be case .    the main features of the @xmath56 spectrum ( [ obs ] ) are the following . first we obtain that the perturbative back - to - back peak of the azimuthal angle distribution is recovered for very large transverse momenta . then , this back - to - back correlation is reduced by the initial state saturation effects included in our cgc approach : as the transverse momenta decrease closer to the saturation scale ( @xmath64 ) , the angular distribution broadens .",
    "finally , we notice that at rhic energies , this does not lead to a complete disappearance of the back - to - back peak .",
    "as can be seen from the kinematics ( [ kine ] ) , the most forward of the two particles essentially determines the value of @xmath65 while the most central one determines the value of @xmath66 in order to quantitatively study the effect of the cgc evolution , the ideal situation would be to keep @xmath65 fixed and to vary @xmath66 in practice , this is better realized by fixing the rapidity and momentum of the most forward particle and by varying the kinematics of the other .",
    "note that doing the opposite would emphasize the @xmath65 evolution of @xmath67 rather than focus on the @xmath5 evolution of @xmath68 moreover , the cross - section ( [ cs ] ) is quite sensitive to choice of factorization scale in the quark density , so it is better to keep @xmath65 constant .",
    "note that varying the rapidities at fixed @xmath69 would keep the product @xmath70 constant , and would force a competition between the evolution of @xmath71 with increasing @xmath65 and the cgc evolution with decreasing @xmath66    in figure 1a , we have studied the @xmath56 spectrum ( [ obs ] ) in the situation in which @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath10 is varied from @xmath75 to @xmath76 as @xmath10 increases , the value of @xmath5 decreases and the suppression of the azimuthal correlation is more important .",
    "however the effect is quite small , because the increase of the saturation scale with decreasing @xmath5 is rather slow . in figure 1b , we investigate the situation for which @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 and @xmath80 is varied @xmath81 to @xmath82 as @xmath80 decreases , it gets closer to the saturation scale @xmath83 ( which also slightly increases as @xmath5 decreases ) , and the suppression of the azimuthal correlation increases .",
    "varying @xmath80 at fixed @xmath10 allows to probe the ratio @xmath84 over a larger range , so the effect is much bigger than when varying @xmath10 at fixed @xmath85    experimental measurements of two - particle correlations in azimuthal angle have been performed in d+au collisions at rhic by the phenix and star collaborations .",
    "the measurements of star @xcite with @xmath86 at forward rapidity and charged hadrons at mid rapidity are qualitatively consistent with a suppression of the back - to - back peak with respect to p+p collisions . by contrast",
    ", the measurements of phenix @xcite do not show any evidence of a suppression of the back - to - back peak , but they probe values of @xmath5 which are bigger than @xmath87 it may very well be that the cgc picture breaks down for values of @xmath5 bigger than @xmath88 and it justifies our choice not to start the small@xmath89 evolution at a higher value .",
    "future measurements of azimuthal correlations between forward particles in d+au collisions , which could be carried out at rhic , will allow quantitative tests of the cgc .",
    "our predictions for the fully differential cross section ( [ cs ] ) are not directly comparable with data : once the cuts used by the experiments become available , integrations over the kinematic variables should be performed .",
    "measurements in p+pb collisions at the lhc would reach @xmath90 and could test even better the qcd evolution at small@xmath91"
