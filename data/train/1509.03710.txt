    "the shape of the sed implies that the ic scenario is not very probable . on the other hand ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung scenario is inconsistent with observations and can be discarded .    from the spatial correlation between the snr and co emission from a molecular cloud , whose presence would be ideal to enhance the gamma - ray luminosity from hadronic interactions , this possibility seems more favorable .",
    "co emission is indeed seen within the best - fit position of the gamma - ray source .",
    "the gev sed of this source is also consistent with a hadronic scenario and , within the uncertainties , the particle population responsible for the emission can be described by either a simple power - law ( index of 2.5 ) or a broken power - law in momentum .",
    "broken power - law distributions have been observed for the particles when the shock of a snr interacts with a mc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the steepening in the distribution might be due to poor particle confinement in regions with low ionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if , as is the case for the leptonic population , a hadronic index of @xmath11.5 is used for the first component of the power - laws , the required index is 3 above a particle momentum break of 3 gev / c , however , these parameters are not well constrained by the data .",
