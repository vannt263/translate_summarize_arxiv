    "it is well - known that standard conservative discretizations of gas dynamics equations in eulerian coordinates generally develop non physical pressure oscillations near contact discontinuities , and more generally near material fronts in multi - component flows .",
    "several cures based on a local non conservative modification have been proposed .",
    "let us quote for instance the hybrid algorithm derived by karni in @xcite and the two - flux method proposed by abgrall and karni in @xcite for multi - fluid flows .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "+ we investigate here a lagrange - projection type method to get rid of pressure oscillations .",
    "the basic motivation lies in the fact that oscillations do not exist in lagrangian computations .",
    "it is then possible to clearly determine which operation in the projection step sparks off pressure oscillations . as in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "a non conservative correction is proposed .",
    "it is based on a local pressure averaging and a random sampling strategy on the mass fraction in order to strictly preserve isolated material fronts and get a statistical conservation property .",
    "numerical results are proposed and compared with the two - flux method @xcite .",
    "we consider a nonlinear partial differential equations model governing the flow of two species @xmath0 and @xmath1 separated by a material interface .",
    "for instance , we focus on two perfect gases and we set @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 respectively denote the pressure , the density , the internal energy , the adiabatic coefficient , the temperature and the specific heats of @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the mixture density is given by @xmath14 and we adopt a dalton s law for the mixture pressure @xmath15 . we assume in addition that the two species evolve according to the same velocity @xmath16 and are at thermal equilibrium , that is @xmath17 .",
    "the mixture internal and total energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then , introducing the mass fraction @xmath22 , straightforward manipulations yield @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 in one - space dimension , the model under consideration writes @xmath26 and for the sake of conciseness , we set @xmath27 the flux function @xmath28 finds a natural definition with respect to the conservative unknowns @xmath29 .",
    "let us mention that ( [ systemec ] ) is hyperbolic with eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , provided that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the characteristic field associated with @xmath36 is linearly degenerate , leading to _ contact discontinuities _ or _",
    "material fronts_. the two extreme fields are genuinely nonlinear .",
    "this section is devoted to the discretization of ( [ systemec ] ) .",
    "as already stated , a specific attention must be paid to the contact discontinuities to avoid pressure oscillations . with this in mind , we first revisit the `` two - flux method '' proposed by abgrall and karni @xcite and then present a new numerical procedure based on a lagrangian approach and a random sampling strategy .",
    "comparisons will be proposed in section [ sec : numexp ] .",
    "+ let us introduce a time step @xmath37 and a space step @xmath38 that we assume to be constant for simplicity .",
    "we set @xmath39 and define the mesh interfaces @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and the intermediate times @xmath42 for @xmath43 . in the sequel",

    "aim of this section is to review the two - flux method proposed by abgrall and karni @xcite .",
    "let us first recall that pressure oscillations do not systematically appear in _ single - fluid _ computations .",
    "abgrall and karni @xcite then propose to replace any conservative _ multi - fluid _",
    "strategy by a non conservative approach based on the definition of two _ single - fluid _ numerical fluxes at each interface .",
    "we first recall the algorithm in details and then suggest a slight modification in order to lessen the conservation errors",

    "* let us consider a two - point numerical flux function @xmath51 consistent with @xmath28 .",

    "two interfacial numerical fluxes @xmath60 and @xmath61 are then defined by @xmath62 where @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 . in some sense , the mass fraction @xmath67 is then assumed to be the same on both side of each interface since @xmath68 is used for the computation of @xmath60 and @xmath69 for @xmath61 . at last , we use @xmath60 , respectively @xmath61 , to update the conservative unknowns @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath70 on the cell @xmath71 , resp . @xmath72 . with clear notations ,",

    "again with clear notations , the vector @xmath81 is then defined @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 with @xmath87 . at last , we set @xmath88 . +   + it is worth noticing that the two - flux method is not conservative on @xmath54 and @xmath55 since the fluxes @xmath60 and @xmath61 defined at each interface are different as soon as @xmath89 .",

    "* it is actually clear from @xcite , @xcite and the references therein that in standard conservative discretizations of ( [ systemec ] ) , only the update formula of the total energy @xmath70 is responsible for the pressure oscillations .",
    "we are then tempted to propose a quasi - conservative variant of the two - flux method such that only the total energy is treated in a non conservative form . for all @xmath41 , we simply replace ( [ mgfs1a ] ) by @xmath90 where again @xmath87 .",
    "the second step is unchanged .      in this section ,",
    "we propose a lagrangian approach for approximating the solutions of ( [ systemec ] ) .",
    "the general idea is to first solve this system in lagrangian coordinates , and then to come back to an eulerian description of the flow with a projection step . under its classical conservative form ,",
    "the lagrange - projection method generates spurious oscillations near the material fronts . in order to remove these oscillations",
    ", we propose to adapt the projection step ( only ) .",
    "we begin with a description of the lagrangian step and then recall , for the sake of clarity , the usual conservative projection step ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "again , an usual @xmath53 cfl restriction is used .",
    "+   + _ the lagrangian step ( @xmath91 ) _ + in this step , ( [ systemec ] ) in written in lagrangian coordinates and solved by an acoustic scheme ( see for instance @xcite ) , which gives @xmath92 where the velocity and the pressure at interfaces are defined by @xmath93 the proposed local approximation @xmath94 of the lagrangian sound speed is @xmath95 but other definitions may be found for instance in @xcite . in this step ,",
    "the grid points @xmath96 move at velocity @xmath97 so that @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 define approximate values of @xmath45 on a lagrangian grid with mesh interfaces @xmath102 .",
    "+   + _ the usual projection step ( @xmath103 ) _",
    "+ aim of this step is to project the solution obtained at the end of the first step on the eulerian grid defined by the mesh interfaces @xmath96 .",
    "usually _ , the choice is made to project the conservative vector @xmath45 in order to obtain a conservative lagrange - projection scheme ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , such a choice writes @xmath104 or , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 * what is wrong with this scheme ? * the lagrange - projection approach allows to precisely reveal the operation that makes the material fronts necessarily damaged by pressure oscillations .",
    "let us indeed consider an isolated material front with uniform velocity and pressure profiles  : @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while @xmath110 if @xmath111 and @xmath112 if @xmath113 .",
    "the density is also set to be uniform for simplicity : @xmath114 .",
    "we first observe that this profile is clearly preserved in the lagrangian step since by ( [ defupintlp ] ) we have @xmath115 and @xmath116 by ( [ defupintlp ] ) .",
    "then , the projection procedure ( [ moyl2phi1 ] ) gives @xmath117 and @xmath118 so that @xmath119 .",
    "after the first time iteration , the velocity profile is then still free of spurious oscillations . at last ,",
    "using the property that this velocity is constant and positive , and focusing for instance on the cell of index @xmath120 , ( [ moyl2phi1 ] ) gives for @xmath121 @xmath122 the pressure is then given after easy calculations by @xmath123 at this stage , there is no reason for @xmath124 to equal @xmath125 from the very first time iteration , a pressure oscillation is then created . as an immediate consequence , the velocity profile will not remain uniform in the next time iteration and the numerical solution is damaged for good .",
    "+   + it is then clear that the way the pressure is updated in the projection step ( only ) is responsible for the spurious oscillations in an usual conservative lagrange - projection scheme .",
    "we propose to modify this step . as for the two - flux method ,",
    "the idea is to give up the conservation property in order to maintain uniform the pressure @xmath56 across material fronts .",
    "let us emphasize that the lagrangian step is unchanged .",
    "+   + _ the quasi - conservative @xmath56-projection step ( @xmath103 ) _ + first of all , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath78 still evolve according to ( [ moyl2phi1 ] ) so that the algorithm remains conservative on these variables .",
    "we will keep on using ( [ moyl2phi1 ] ) for @xmath126 only for @xmath71 not in a subset @xmath127 of @xmath128 defined below . on the contrary , the pressure @xmath56 ( instead of @xmath70 )",
    "is averaged for @xmath129 : @xmath130 for @xmath129 , we then set @xmath81 with @xmath85 , and @xmath88 .",
    "+   + * definition of @xmath127 . * up to our knowledge , the idea of averaging the pressure @xmath56 in a lagrange - projection strategy first appeared in @xcite .",
    "this way to proceed is clearly sufficient to remove the pressure oscillations near the material fronts if @xmath131 .",
    "however , averaging the pressure @xmath56 instead of the total energy @xmath70 for all @xmath41 gives a non conservative scheme that is expected to provide discontinuous solutions violating the rankine - hugoniot conditions , see for instance hou and lefloch @xcite ( note however that here , the lagrangian system associated with ( [ systeme ] ) is actually treated in a _ conservative _ form , while the pressure averaging takes place in the projection step only ) .",
    "this was confirmed in practice when considering solutions involving shocks with large amplitude .",
    "then , in order to lessen the conservation errors , we propose to localize the non conservative treatment around the contact discontinuities setting @xmath132 for a given @xmath133 .",
    "following karni @xcite , we will use @xmath134 in practice .",
    "+   + _ the quasi - conservative @xmath56-projection step with sampling ( @xmath103 ) _ + the quasi - conservative @xmath56-projection step will be seen in the next section to properly compute large amplitude shock propagations .",
    "localizing the averaging process of @xmath56 nevertheless prevents the method from keeping strictly uniform the velocity and pressure profiles of an isolated material front , see * test a * below .",
    "indeed , note that since @xmath135 is generally a _ strict _ subset of @xmath128 due to the numerical diffusion on @xmath67 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath136 ) , an usual conservative treatment is still used on @xmath70 as soon as @xmath71 not in @xmath135 .",
    "this is sufficient to create pressure oscillations . in order to cure this problem",
    ", we propose to get rid of the numerical diffusion on @xmath67 so as to enforce the non conservative treatment ( [ newp ] ) across an isolated material front .",
    "this objective is achieved when replacing the conservative updating formula ( [ moyl2phi1 ] ) for @xmath78 with random sampling strategy applied to @xmath67 ( see also @xcite and @xcite for similar ideas ) .",
    "more precisely , we consider an equidistributed random sequence @xmath137 in @xmath138 ( following collela @xcite , we take in practice the celebrated van der corput sequence ) , define @xmath139 for all @xmath41 and set @xmath140 then , we set @xmath141 so that the conservation of @xmath78 now holds only statistically .",
    "we propose two numerical experiments with @xmath142 and @xmath143 associated with a riemann initial data .",
    "the left and right vectors @xmath144 are denoted @xmath145 and @xmath146 and the initial discontinuity is at @xmath147 . in the first simulation ( * test a * ) , we consider the propagation of an isolated material interface with @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we take @xmath150 and plot the solutions at time @xmath151 . the second simulation",
    "( * test b * ) develops a strong shock due to a large initial pressure ratio .",
    "more precisely , we choose @xmath152 and @xmath153 . we take @xmath154 and plot the solutions at time @xmath155 .",
    "+ we observe that the two - flux method and the lagrangian methods are in agreement with the exact solutions and give similar results .",
    "as expected , note that the lagrangian approach without sampling does not strictly maintain uniform the pressure profile for * test a*. note also that the mass fraction @xmath67 is sharp when a random sampling is used . at last , the relative conservation error on @xmath70 ( see for instance @xcite for more details ) for the lagrangian approach with random sampling is actually less important and swings around 0.2% only .",
    "we have investigated a lagrange - projection approach for computing material fronts in multi - fluid models .",
    "we get similar results to the two - flux method @xcite with less important conservation errors on @xmath70 .",
