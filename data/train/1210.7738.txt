    "mn@xmath7vga has a pseudogap around the fermi level with pbe .",
    "a gap is opened by mbjlda , and the fermi energy is located within the gap .",
    "fe@xmath7val , fe@xmath7vga , and fe@xmath7tisn , three semimetals or zero gap semiconductors within pbe , are predicted to be semiconductors by mbjlda .",
    "ni@xmath7mnsn , cu@xmath7mnal , and cu@xmath7mnsn were included in this study to observe the influence of mbjlda on the magnetic moment and the exchange splitting of ferromagnetic heusler compounds that do not have a gap at all . in all three cases the magnetic moments of pbe and mbjlda are close ; while the agreement with experiment is very good for ni@xmath7mnsn , both approximations underestimate the moment of cu@xmath7mnal and cu@xmath7mnsn .",
    "this is surprising , seeing that mbjlda predicts too large moments for fe ( 2.49@xmath10 ) and ni ( 0.74@xmath10 ) and too large exchange splittings at the same time.@xcite notably , pbe ( and lda ) already predict too large exchange splittings , although the moments are accurate.@xcite the small influence of mbjlda on the magnetic moment in cu@xmath7mnal and cu@xmath7mnsn may be associated with the localized character of the magnetic moment.@xcite thus , an increase of the exchange splitting does not lead to an enhanced magnetic moment . in contrast , fe and ni have more itinerant character , so the moments depend strongly on the magnitude of the exchange splitting .    the inverse heusler compound cr@xmath7coga has been predicted as a nearly fully compensated ferrimagnet.@xcite it has a small gap slightly above the fermi energy . in the mbjlda description",
    ", this gap is further enlarged and the fermi energy moves closer to the gap , thereby further reducing the magnetic moment towards zero . experimentally , a non - zero moment is observed,@xcite which may be due to atomic disorder .",
    "mn@xmath7coal is a ferrimagnet , and it is predicted to be a spin gapless semiconductor@xcite by pbe . this prediction has recently been confirmed experimentally.@xcite this is also the case within mbjlda , and the minority spin gap is only slightly enhanced ( similar to the case of mn@xmath7val ) .",
    "mn@xmath7coge is a half - metal in both approximations , but mbjlda considerably enhances the minority gap .",
    "fe@xmath7cosi is described by pbe as a conventional ferromagnet with a pseudogap in the minority spin channel around the fermi energy .",
    "mbjlda opens a sizeable gap and predicts fe@xmath7cosi to be a half - metal .",
    "we note that the magnetic moments inside the muffin - tin spheres are increased with mbjlda in all cases , which is compensated by an antiparallel interstitial moment ( for ferromagnets ) or by the antiparallel alignment of the muffin - tin moments ( for ferrimagnets ) .",
    "the integer magnetic moments are protected by the half - metallic gaps .      in figure",
    "[ fig : dos ] we compare the dos from pbe and mbjlda calculations for some selected compounds .",
    "we observe that the effect of mbjlda ( compared to pbe ) is very material - dependent and non - trivial . in all cases",
    "we observe that the energy range of the occupied _",

    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig : c_dependence ] ( top ) .",

    "remarkably , the three compounds belonging to the second class are ferrimagnets , whereas the compounds in the first class are ferromagnets or nonmagnetic ( fe@xmath7val ) .",
    "in contrast to semiconductor and insulator gaps,@xcite the half - metallic gap does not necessarily grow monotonously as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "setting @xmath36 nearly restores the pbe values for the gaps in most cases .",

    "a corresponding dos plot is shown exemplarily for co@xmath7mnsi in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_dependence ] ( bottom ) .",
    "this agrees with earlier calculations with the bjlda potential of semiconductor and insulator gaps.@xcite    it is well - known that the local xc functionals ( both lda and gga ) fail to predict the ground state magnetic moment of co@xmath7fesi correctly.@xcite mbjlda does not resolve this problem with the @xmath0 value from eq .",

    "a just half - metallic ground - state can be obtained with the fermi energy at the minority conduction band minimum , and the magnetic moment is @xmath40 , in accordance with experiments.@xcite as we discuss in the following , such a high value of @xmath0 is rather unrealistic .",
    "the experimental determination of the half - metallic gap is notoriously difficult .",
    "only indirect evidence for the presence and the size of such gaps is available .",
    "this evidence comes from tunnel spectroscopy of magnetic tunnel junctions with amorphous barriers@xcite or from x - ray absorption spectroscopy.@xcite for co@xmath7mnsi , a combination of the minority spin flip gap from tunnel spectroscopy of @xmath41ev and the position of the x - ray absorption maximum of co at its l@xmath42 edge of @xmath43ev above @xmath44 gives an upper boundary of @xmath45ev for the minority gap .",
    "note , however , that the co _",
    "_ d__dos maximum is about 0.3ev above the minority conduction band minimum in the pbe and mbjlda calculations ; the gap is therefore smaller than @xmath43ev .",
    "thus , considering the available experimental data , the mbjlda value for the minority gap is considerably too large and the pbe value is slightly too small .",
    "also the spectral shapes of the co l@xmath42 x - ray absorption spectra are not well reproduced by mbjlda .",
    "consider , e.g. , co@xmath7tisn ( fig . [ fig : cms - cts ] left ) , which has a pronounced double - peak structure@xcite arising from a pure co @xmath46 and a co - ti hybrid @xmath47 state , which are separated by 0.9ev in the pbe calculation . due to the excitation process",
    ", a screened core - hole is formed and pulls the localized @xmath46 states down by 0.3ev , so the total separation of the peaks is predicted to be 1.2ev , which is close to the experimental value of 1.3ev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cms - cts ] ) .",
    "note that the experimental spectra are broadened due to finite lifetime effects .",
    "this double - peak structure is clearly visible in the unoccupied pbe dos of co@xmath7tisn in fig .",
    "[ fig : cms - cts ] . in contrast",
    ", the mbjlda moves the @xmath46 peak up , such that it overlaps with the @xmath47 peak , and no double - peak structure would be visible .",
    "a similar but less pronounced structure is also present in the absorption spectra of co@xmath7mnsi ( fig .",

    "data taken from refs . .,width=336 ]    the gaps of fe@xmath7val and fe@xmath7tisn predicted by mbjlda should easily be detectable with optical methods and by electrical transport .",
    "however , both compounds have been characterized as semimetals by experiments.@xcite hence , the overestimation of the heusler compound band gaps by mbjlda is not limited to magnetic cases , where the different spin densities may lead to an error in the determination of @xmath0 , but is also found for paramagnetic materials .    while the band gap ( and actually the entire band structure ) is a property of excited states , the magnetic moments and hyperfine fields are ground state properties .",
    "the total moments were already discussed above and good agreement with experiment was shown for pbe and mbjlda in most cases .",
    "we now turn to the hyperfine fields @xmath48 , which we calculate from the fermi contact term , ignoring other contributions.@xcite as mentioned above , the bjlda potential ( @xmath38 ) provides densities of states that are very similar to those of pbe .",
    "therefore we compare the hyperfine contact fields computed with pbe , mbjlda , and bjlda for five heusler compounds .",
    "the hyperfine fields and the corresponding site - resolved magnetic moments are given in table [ tab : hyperfine ] .",
    "the pbe functional provides reasonable hyperfine contact fields with a mean absolute error ( mean error ) of 64koe ( @xmath4944koe ) for the present test set .",
    "no clear trend towards an over- or underestimation of the hyperfine fields is visible .",
    "the pbe values are similar to those calculated by picozzi _ _ et al.__@xcite mbjlda and bjlda perform less well , with mean absolute errors ( mean errors ) of 133koe ( @xmath4973koe ) and 135koe ( @xmath49101koe ) , respectively , where the mean of the experimental values is @xmath5078koe .",
    "since mbjlda and bjlda produce very different results , the hyperfine fields depend critically on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "again , no clear trend towards an over- or underestimation with respect to experiment or with respect to the other approximations is obvious .",
    "although bjlda and pbe predict similar magnetic moments and dos , there are notable differences in the wavefunctions , particularly those of the _ s _ states , which provide the dominant contribution to the transfered hyperfine contact field .",

    "<S> we have investigated the electronic structures of various potentially half - metallic heusler compounds with the tran - blaha modified becke - johnson ( tb - mbjlda ) potential within the density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the half - metallic gaps are considerably enhanced with respect to values from the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) functional . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the unoccupied densities of states are modified by mbjlda , and agreement with experiment is considerably worse than for pbe . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of the densities of states can be improved by reducing the tran - blaha parameter @xmath0 . however </S>",
    "<S> , ground state properties such as the hyperfine fields are more accurately described by pbe than by mbjlda . despite its success for ionic and covalent semiconductors and insulators , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that mbjlda is not a suitable approximation for half - metallic heusler compounds . </S>"
