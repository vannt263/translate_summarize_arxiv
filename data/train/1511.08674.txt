    "3 we prove that the spectrum determines @xmath0 when @xmath44 .",
    "the proof uses the classification of graphs with least eigenvalue greater than @xmath45 .",
    "+ graphs with the same spectrum are called _ cospectral_. an important property of a pair of cospectral graphs is that they have the same number of closed walks of any given length . in particular",

    "the two cospectral graphs are drawn in figure  1 .    ]    in the next result we obtain more graphs which are nonisomorphic but cospectral with the pineapple graph .",

    "for example , @xmath87 is the generalized line graph of @xmath94 of type @xmath90 , provided a vertex of degree @xmath93 has label  @xmath93 .",
    "[ cd ] let @xmath46 be a connected graph with least eigenvalue greater than @xmath45 .",

    "* @xmath46 has six vertices , and @xmath97 .",

    "[ q=2 ] the pineapple graph @xmath102 is determined by the spectrum of its adjacency matrix .",
    "suppose that @xmath46 is a graph cospectral with @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath46 has @xmath103 vertices , @xmath104 edges and @xmath105 triangles , and the characteristic polynomial @xmath26 of @xmath46 is equal to @xmath106 from this it follows that @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "suppose @xmath46 is disconnected .",
    "if there exist two components with at least one edge , then @xmath109 is an induced subgraph of @xmath46 .",
    "eigenvalue interlacing gives @xmath110 , contradiction .",
    "so only one component of @xmath46 has edges .",
    "the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath59 equals @xmath93 , therefore @xmath46 has two components , one of which is an isolated vertices .",
    "the larger component @xmath111 has characteristic polynomial @xmath112 , so @xmath113 .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ cd ] , @xmath111 has seven vertices .",
    "we know that @xmath111 has @xmath114 edges and @xmath115 triangles .",
    "one straightforwardly checks that there are exactly ten connected graphs on seven vertices with 17 edges , and none has 20 triangles .",
    "this proves that @xmath46 is connected and @xmath116 .",
    "so we are dealing with case @xmath117 or @xmath118 of lemma  [ cd ] .",
    "+ in case  @xmath117 , @xmath46 is the line graph of a unicyclic graph @xmath49 with @xmath103 vertices .",
    "let @xmath119 be a vertex of @xmath49 of maximum degree @xmath120 and put @xmath121 .",
    "when @xmath119 is not in a triangle of @xmath49 , every edge not incident with @xmath119 is incident with at most one neighbor of @xmath119 .",
    "therefore there are at least @xmath122 pairs of disjoint edges in @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath119 is in a triangle @xmath123 then the edge @xmath124 is incident with @xmath125 and @xmath126 and disjoint from @xmath127 edges through @xmath119 .",
    "so we obtain at least @xmath128 pairs of disjoint edges in @xmath49 .",
    "disjoint edges in @xmath49 correspond to pairs of nonadjacent vertices in @xmath46 .",
    "this implies that @xmath46 has at most @xmath129 edges .",
    "thus we find @xmath130 , which leads to @xmath131 .",
    "this implies that @xmath132 , @xmath133 , or @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 , then @xmath49 has at most @xmath136 vertices of degree  @xmath137 ( indeed , the average degree equals @xmath138 , so the number of vertices of degree 1 equals the number of vertices of degree 3 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath46 has at most @xmath139 triangles , and therefore @xmath140 , which gives @xmath141 .",
    "the case @xmath7 is solved in @xcite , and when @xmath142 , @xmath46 has @xmath143 edges and @xmath144 triangles and no @xmath145 ( since @xmath49 has maximum degree @xmath137 ) , which is impossible .    if @xmath146 , then @xmath147 , hence @xmath46 has @xmath148 edges , which is false .    if @xmath149 , then there are just two ways to create an odd cycle in @xmath49 by adding two edges . in both cases",
    "we obtain @xmath150 with one pendent edge attached to a vertex of degree at most @xmath138 which leads to more than @xmath151 triangles in @xmath46 .",
    "suppose @xmath134 .",
    "we get the maximum possible number of triangles in @xmath46 if @xmath49 consist of a triangle with @xmath127 pendent edges in one vertex of the triangle and @xmath152 pendant edges on another vertex . in all three cases",
    "@xmath46 has fewer triangles than @xmath153 .",
    "so we can conclude that there are no graphs cospectral with @xmath153 in case @xmath117 .",
    "+ finally , we consider case  @xmath118 of lemma  [ cd ] .",
    "then @xmath46 is a generalized line graph of a tree @xmath154 with @xmath25 vertices and @xmath72 edges of type @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath49 be the line graph of @xmath154 , let @xmath119 be a vertex of @xmath154 with maximum degree @xmath120 , and define @xmath121 .",
    "then @xmath49 has at most @xmath155 edges , and @xmath46 has at most @xmath156 edges , hence @xmath157 , which leads to @xmath158 .",
    "so @xmath159 , @xmath160 , or @xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath159,then equality holds in the above inequality , which means the two edges of @xmath154 which are not incident with @xmath119 intersect .",
    "this implies that @xmath49 is the coalescence of @xmath162 and a triangle , or the coalescence of @xmath162 with the path @xmath163 at a pendent vertex of @xmath163 .",
    "this leads to seven possible generalized line graphs of type @xmath90 ( depending on which vertex has label  @xmath93 ) .",
    "none of these has @xmath105 triangles .    if @xmath160 , then @xmath49 consists of the complete graph @xmath162 with one pendent edge .",
    "now there are only three possible generalized line graphs of the required type , and none has @xmath105 triangles .    if @xmath161 , then @xmath164 , and @xmath165",
    "there are two generalized line graphs possible , but only @xmath87 has @xmath105 triangles .",
    "so @xmath166 .",
    "for @xmath167 , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath0 is less than @xmath45 , so the proof of theorem  [ q=2 ] does not generalize to larger @xmath1 . moreover , since @xmath16 and @xmath83 are not determined by their spectrum , it will already be difficult to settle the spectral characterization of @xmath0 when @xmath142 and when @xmath168 .",
    "the graphs cospectral with @xmath0 presented in propositions  [ cospectral1 ] and  [ cospectral2 ] have an integral eigenvalue @xmath58 .",
    "so it is conceivable that the pineapple graphs with three nonintegral eigenvalues are determined by their spectrum . for such pineapple graphs the three nonintegral eigenvalues belong to one component ,",
    "so the graph consists of one large component and a number of isolated vertices .",
    "but we doubt if this observation is useful , since the examples of proposition  [ cospectral1 ] also have this structure",
