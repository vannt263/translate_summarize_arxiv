    "a quantitative understanding of the galactic evolution of nuclei heavier than iron has been so far a challenging problem . although some of the basic tools of this task have been presented several years ago , both from an observational ( spite & spite  1978 , 1979 ; sneden & parthasaraty 1983 ; gilroy et al .",
    "1988 ) and a theoretical point of view ( truran  1981 ) , only recently the observational data have grown sufficiently in number and precision to allow a direct comparison with theoretical predictions ( see mcwilliam  1995 for a review ) . in order to reconstruct the evolutionary history of neutron - rich elements in the galaxy one has to disentangle the @xmath0- and @xmath1-contributions of all their isotopes and follow their abundance as a function of galactic age .",
    "the results must then be compared with the available spectroscopic observations of stars at different metallicities , both in the galactic halo and disk , mainly from f and g dwarfs and giants whose surface abundances reflect the composition of the gas from which they formed ( gratton & sneden  1994 ; edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) .    already in the seminal work by burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) , the synthesis of neutron - rich nuclei was attributed to two different mechanisms .",
    "the first ( the @xmath0-process ) is characterized by _",
    "neutron captures and occurs mainly during hydrostatic he - burning phases of stellar evolution . here _",
    "slow _ means that most unstable nuclei encountered along the neutron capture path have time to decay before capturing another neutron . the second mechanism ( the @xmath1-process )",
    "is due to the more _ rapid _ neutron captures and is generally associated with explosive conditions in supernovae ( hereafter sne ) . for a comprehensive review on the astrophysical sites of neutron capture nucleosynthesis , see wheeler , sneden , & truran ( 1989 ) .",
    "the current understanding of the @xmath0-process is supported by many observational and theoretical works ( summarized in sect .",
    "2 ) , indicating that the heavier @xmath0-nuclei , from sr to pb , belonging to the so - called _ main _ component ( clayton & ward 1974 ; kppeler et al . 1982 ) , are synthesized during the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phase of low - mass stars , mainly in the mass range @xmath94  @xmath10  ( see e.g. gallino , busso , & lugaro 1997 ; busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 , hereafter bgw ) .",
    "a different site for the production of @xmath0-process nuclei is required to account for the _ weak _ component , i.e. for @xmath0-nuclei below the sr - peak .",
    "this site was identified in the advanced evolutionary phases of massive stars ( lamb et al . 1977 ; prantzos et al .",
    "1990 ; raiteri et al .",
    "1993 ) .    as for the @xmath1-process ,",
    "the actual astrophysical environment is still a matter of debate ( woosley et al .",
    "1994 ; wheeler , cowan , & hillebrandt  1998 ) .",
    "it has been recently shown that at least two different supernova sources are required for the synthesis of the @xmath1-nuclei below or beyond the neutron magic number @xmath11 ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino  1996 ; see also sneden et al .",
    "for the elements considered here , we make the simplifying hypothesis that their @xmath1-contributions in the solar system can be considered of primary origin ( i.e. with yields independent of the initial stellar metallicity ) . hence , after the @xmath0-contributions at the epoch of the solar formation have been estimated with the use of a reliable model for the chemical evolution of the galaxy , the @xmath1-process abundance fractions can be derived by subtracting the @xmath0-fractions from the solar abundances .",
    "the study of the galactic evolution of elements produced by @xmath0- and @xmath1-processes was addressed in previous investigations only at a semi - quantitative level .",
    "for example , andreani , vangioni - flam , & audouze  ( 1988 ) , and , more recently , pagel & tautvaiien  ( 1997 ) have assumed _ ad hoc _ stellar yields and time delays for representative @xmath0 and @xmath1 elements in order to fit the observational data . with a different approach , mathews , bazan , & cowan  ( 1992 ) , following a preliminary analysis by clayton ( 1988 ) , examined the effects introduced by the primary nature of the @xmath2c  neutron source on the @xmath0-process yields , and inferred that for metallicities @xmath12 the neutron exposure @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the neutron density and @xmath15 the thermal velocity ) roughly scales as @xmath16 . under the crude assumption",
    "that the production ( in mass fraction ) of a given @xmath0-isotope depends on the product of the neutron exposure times the abundance of iron group seeds , mathews et al .",
    "( 1992 ) estimated the stellar @xmath0 yields by simply scaling the solar @xmath0-abundances with metallicity . today the work of mathews et al .",
    "( 1992 ) needs to be revised , as quantitative yields are now available from detailed nucleosynthesis calculations based on tp - agb models for different masses and metallicities , with updated reaction networks and neutron capture cross sections .",
    "in addition , as anticipated by truran ( 1981 ) , at low metallicities the @xmath1-process contribution to the various elements becomes dominant .    in this paper , we concentrate on elements from ba to eu , not only because they belong to a major abundance peak , but also because they contain species of very different origin , ranging from almost pure @xmath1-process production , as is the case for eu , to a dominant @xmath0-process origin , as is the case for ba .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we analyze the neutron capture process in agb stars ; in sect .  3 we describe the adopted model for the chemical evolution of the galaxy and the updates introduced in the present work ; in sect .",
    "4 we show the model results for the elements considered ( ba , la , ce , pr , nd , sm , and eu ) and for their isotopes ; finally , in sect .",
    "5 we summarize the main conclusions and point out a few aspects deserving further analysis .",
    "the first quantitative model for the production of @xmath0-process nuclei with @xmath17 was presented by truran & iben ( 1977 ) and by iben & truran ( 1978 ) .",
    "it was based on the activation of the @xmath6ne(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath7 mg  neutron source in tp - agb stars of intermediate mass ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , subsequent reanalyses showed that the attempts to reproduce the solar main component through the @xmath6ne(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath7 mg  neutron source suffer from major nuclear problems ( despain 1980 ; howard et al .",
    "1986 ; mathews et al . 1986",
    "; busso et al .",
    "1988 ) . on the other hand",
    ", observations revealed that the luminosities of ms , s and c ( n type ) stars are generally much lower than predicted by the above models , thus pointing out that the dominant contributors to the synthesis of carbon and @xmath0-process elements are agb stars of lower mass ( see e.g. clegg , lambert , & bell  1979 ; blanco , mccarthy , & blanco  1980 ; smith & lambert  1986 ; lambert et al .",
    "in low - mass agb stars the maximum temperature reached during thermal instabilties in the he shell is too low ( @xmath19  k ) for @xmath6ne  to be significantly consumed .",
    "consequently , neutron captures must be driven by the alternative @xmath2c(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath5o  reaction ( cameron 1954 ) , which can easily be activated at much lower temperatures ( for the rate of this reaction see caughlan & fowler 1988 and denker et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath2c  left in the he intershell from previous h burning is by far too low to be of any relevance in the neutron production .",
    "a challenging problem is therefore to explain how a sufficient amount of @xmath2c  can be built locally .",
    "the common hypothesis is that some protons can penetrate below the formal convective border of the envelope into the top layers of the he intershell .",
    "at h re - ignition , these protons are captured by the abundant @xmath20c left by partial he burning in the previous convective pulse , giving rise to a tiny layer enriched in @xmath2c ( the so - called @xmath2c pocket ) . the first mechanism considered in order to generate a @xmath2c pocket was the semi - convective mixing of h into the @xmath20c - rich and he - rich intershell , driven by increased carbon opacity in the cool expanding envelope after the quenching of a thermal pulse ( iben & renzini  1982a , b ) .",
    "this process was shown to be relevant for population ii stars ( hollowell & iben  1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "once formed , the @xmath2c  pocket was assumed to be engulfed by the next convective pulse releasing neutrons . the resulting neutron density , originally estimated to be very high ( @xmath21 10@xmath22 n/@xmath23 , see malaney 1986 ) was subsequently shown to be of the order of ( 510)@xmath24 n/@xmath23 ( kppeler et al 1990 ; gallino , raiteri , & busso 1993 ) .",
    "however , semiconvection was found to become inefficient in galactic disk stars ( iben 1983 ) , and no obvious alternative from simple diffusive mixing was found to work ( iben 1982 ) .",
    "the penetration of the convective envelope into the partially he - burnt zone after each pulse ( the so - called _ third dredge - up _ ) leaves a sharp h / c discontinuity between the h - rich envelope and the @xmath20c - rich and he - rich intershell , which is likely to be smoothed by some sort of mixing at the interface , by chemical diffusion , semiconvection , or rotational shear ( langer et al .",
    "1999 ) . to address this point , a rather sophisticated treatment of the hydrodynamic behavior at the h / he boundary would be required .",
    "first attempts with a diffusive approach ( herwig et al .",
    "1997 ) , or with a fully hydrodynamical formulation ( singh , roxburgh , & chan 1998 ) have been recently presented and do show formation of a @xmath2c  reservoir .",
    "indeed , penetration of protons at the top of the @xmath20c - rich intershell appears to be plausible , but the mass involved and the resulting h profile have still to be treated as relatively free parameters .",
    "a dedicated effort on hydrodynamical grounds constitutes a major challenge for agb calculations and @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis studies .",
    "a more indirect approach is to consider different choices for the mass and profiles of the @xmath2c  pocket , and to estimate their effects on the nucleosynthesis results for agb models of various metallicities .",
    "the tp - agb models by straniero et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) showed that any amount of @xmath2c  produced by a proton penetration below the convective envelope border burns radiatively in the interpulse period , at a relatively low temperature ( @xmath25  k ) and neutron density ( @xmath26 n/@xmath23 ) , giving rise to a tiny layer extremely enriched in @xmath0-process isotopes that will be engulfed by the next convective instability .",
    "the resulting pattern of agb nucleosynthesis , and its dependence on the initial metallicity of the star , have been recently discussed by gallino et al .",
    "the changes introduced by these recent studies are important : not only the neutron density is lower by a factor of @xmath27 than in previous estimates , but the distribution of neutron exposures can no longer be approximated by an exponential distribution , as commonly assumed previously , with relevant consequences for the dependence of neutron captures on metallicity ( busso et al .",
    "a thorough analysis of the implications of the new models is presented by bgw .",
    "the stellar evolution results shown in this paper are all based on calculations performed with franec ( frascati raphson - newton evolutionary code , see chieffi & straniero  1989 ) .",
    "stellar models appropriate for population i stars have already been presented in straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; additional models have been computed specifically for the present paper .",
    "our set of agb models includes stars of masses from 1.5 , 2 , 3 and 5  @xmath10 , and metallicity @xmath28 , 0.01 and 0.02 .",
    "mass - loss was taken into account adopting the parametrization by reimers ( 1975 ) with values of the @xmath29 parameter ranging from 0 to 5 .",
    "the franec agb models reproduce self - consistently the third dredge - up episode and the consequent mixing of freshly synthesized @xmath0-processed material ( together with @xmath30he and @xmath20c ) to the surface of the star . according to straniero et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1997 ) and gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the third dredge - up starts after a limited number of thermal pulses , increasing its efficiency up to a maximum while the pulsing mechanism goes on , then decreases as mass loss and the advancement of the h - burning shell reduce the envelope mass , and eventually ceases when the latter decreases below about 0.5 @xmath10 .",
    "the mass and the profile of the @xmath2c  pocket were constrained by busso et al .",
    "( 1995 , see also busso et al .",
    "1999 ) by comparing the results of neutron capture models with spectroscopically determined abundances in population i agb stars and in population ii ba and ch stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath31 ( smith & lambert  1990 ; luck & bond 1991 ; vanture 1992 ; plez , smith , & lambert  1993 ) .",
    "this was done by keeping constant the total mass of the @xmath2c  pocket and parametrically varying the concentration of @xmath2c  by factors from 0 to 2 times the profile indicated as `` standard '' ( st ) by gallino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , corresponding for the choice of the mass of the @xmath2c  pocket made for this work to @xmath32  @xmath10of @xmath2c . as a result of this study ,",
    "the st choice for the @xmath2c  pocket , when used in an agb stellar model of metallicity @xmath33 , was shown to reproduce remarkably well the abundance distribution of the solar main component ( see also arlandini et al . 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "however , agb stars in the galactic disk show a significant spread in their abundances of @xmath0-process elements ( see discussion in busso et al .",
    "1995 and busso et al .",
    "this spread can be attributed , at least in part , to variations in the @xmath2c  profile , since the @xmath0-process efficiency depends strongly and non linearly on the local @xmath2c  abundance . following this indication ,",
    "we have explored different extensions in mass of the @xmath2c  pocket , while keeping for all metallicities the same @xmath2c  profile as in st case .",
    "we will later comment briefly on these choices .",
    "let us mention here that the same choice was found to be appropriate to account for the @xmath0-process isotopic signatures of heavy elements ( among which ba , nd , and sm ) in presolar grains most likely condensed in the circumstellar envelopes of agb stars of solar metallicity ( gallino et al .",
    "1993 ; gallino et al .",
    "1997 ) and recovered in meteoritic material ( ott & begemann  1990 ; prombo et al .  1993 ; zinner  1997 ; hoppe & ott  1997 ) .    at the end of the tp - agb phase ,",
    "the @xmath0-process contributions to the ism are determined by the amount of matter cumulatively dredged - up from the he intershell to the surface and lost by stellar winds .",
    "this quantity is shown in tab .  1 for the 2 , 3 , and 5  @xmath10  stellar models and different metallicities ( for the 5  @xmath34 star we did not compute the model at @xmath28 but we doubled the cumulative dredged - up mass mixed into the envelope with respect to the solar case , in analogy with the results obtained for the 2 and 3 @xmath10  cases ) .",
    "table 1 + cumulative dredged - up mass in the envelope ( in @xmath10 ) for agb stars +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have calculated the evolution of @xmath4-capture elements from ba to eu in the interstellar gas of the galaxy .",
    "the input stellar yields for neutron - rich nuclei have been separated into their @xmath0- and @xmath1-process components .",
    "we have obtained the @xmath0-yields with post - process calculations based on agb models computed with the franec code .",
    "the results of the galactic evolution model , compared with spectroscopic observations of f and g dwarf stars , confirm the basic nucleosynthesis scenario outlined by straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gallino et al .",
    "the @xmath2c neutron source , active during the interpulse phases of low - mass tp - agb stars , accounts for most of the @xmath0-process contribution to elements from ba to eu . in the galactic disk",
    "the abundance of ba is dominated by the @xmath0-process for [ fe / h ] @xmath35 . at lower metallicities ,",
    "the primary @xmath1-process contribution , relatively small at the time of formation of the sun ( 20% of solar ba ) , plays a dominant role .",
    "concerning the enrichment of the galaxy in the @xmath1-process elements , the comparison of the predictions of the galactic chemical model with the available spectroscopic data for population ii stars suggests a production from snii slightly delayed with respect to the main phase of oxygen enrichment .",
    "the overall decline of [ @xmath1/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] in the most metal - poor stars can be explained if the @xmath1-process derives from core - collapse sne at the lowest stellar mass limit , around 810  @xmath10  .",
    "the galactic evolution of the lighter @xmath0-process nuclei ( e.g. sr , y , zr ) as well as of pb will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "spectroscopic determinations of the abundance of these elements in galactic halo stars are currently under way ( see e.g. sneden et al .",
    "1998 for recent hst data ) . concerning pb , preliminary results on the @xmath0-fraction at @xmath36 and on its sharp increase at low metallicities ,",
    "confirm the prediction by gallino et al .",

    "<S> we follow the chemical evolution of the galaxy for elements from ba to eu , using an evolutionary model suitable to reproduce a large set of galactic ( local and non local ) and extragalactic constraints . </S>",
    "<S> input stellar yields for neutron - rich nuclei have been separated into their @xmath0-process and @xmath1-process components . the production of @xmath0-process elements in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operation of two neutron sources : the dominant reaction @xmath2c(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath5o , which releases neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase , and the reaction @xmath6ne(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath7 mg , marginally activated during thermal instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath0-process distribution is strongly dependent on the stellar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> for the _ standard _ model discussed in this paper , it shows a sharp production of the ba - peak elements around @xmath8 . concerning the @xmath1-process yields </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the production of @xmath1-nuclei is a primary process occurring in stars near the lowest mass limit for type ii supernova progenitors . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-contribution to each nucleus is computed as the difference between its solar abundance and its @xmath0-contribution given by the galactic chemical evolution model at the epoch of the solar system formation . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with spectroscopic abundances of elements from ba to eu at various metallicities ( mainly from f and g stars ) showing that the observed trends can be understood in the light of the present knowledge of neutron capture nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss a number of emerging features that deserve further scrutiny . </S>"
