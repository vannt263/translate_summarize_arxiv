    "the gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule  @xcite states that @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the proton(neutron ) anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath2 is the laboratory photon energy , @xmath3 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath4 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the left - hand - side represents the single - nucleon contribution to the spin - flip amplitude , while the right - hand - side involves an integration over the difference of helicity 3/2 and 1/2 @xmath5-nucleon total cross sections .",
    "this relation can be derived on the basis of fundamental principles ( such as gauge and lorentz invariance ) and is expected to be satisfied exactly . while early results  @xcite suggested a possible violation , careful measurements and estimates of the important high - energy contribution have greatly reduced this discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "it now seems unlikely that the sum rule , and the fundamental assumptions used in its derivation , are violated .",
    "early estimates of the gdh integral used phenomenological single - pion photoproduction amplitudes and crude estimates for two - pion and other - meson production . particularly important",
    "are the two - pion production contributions , as they dominate the total photoabsorption cross section over much of the resonance region .",
    "to illustrate this point , the said  @xcite and maid  @xcite single - pion contributions to the total photoabsorption cross section have been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : g1 ] . some of these two - pion channels have been measured separately , and would appear to give a significant contribution to the gdh sum rule over much of the resonance region  @xcite . however , a quite different conclusion results if the measured helicity - dependent total cross section ( @xmath6 ) is compared to its single - pion contribution over the resonance region . single - pion predictions for the said and maid analyses are again plotted for comparison in fig .  [",
    "fig : g2 ] .",
    "the contribution from eta - meson photoproduction is significant near its threshold , due to the dominant n(1535 ) , but is expected to contribute little at higher energies .",
    "its contribution , obtained from a said fit to eta - photoproduction data , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g3 ] .",
    "the contributions from kaon photoproduction are also small , based on fits to the existing data .    in the proton sum rule ,",
    "both the said and maid single - pion predictions account for almost the entire result for photon energies above 1  gev .",
    "the said results extend over a larger energy region , but qualitatively agree with maid where comparisons are possible . the said single - pion contribution to",
    "the neutron sum rule also tends to follow the gdh measurement . here",
    ", however , the maid fit diverges from the data , which ( assuming a correct single - pion part ) would imply a large and increasing two - pion contribution to the neutron .",
    "the dip near 900  mev is seen in both the said and maid single - pion contributions to the neutron sum rule and does not appear to be the result of a problem in the multipole analysis .",
    "however , other quantities predicted by the said and maid fits are often quite different , particularly above 1  gev in the photon energy . in figs .  [ fig : g4](a ) and [ fig : g4](b ) , we compare the said and maid fits to @xmath7 differential cross section and @xmath8 @xmath9 data .    conclusions regarding single - pion contributions to the neutron sum rule are much less solid , as the underlying single - pion photoproduction database is less complete and precise than the available proton - target data . in particular , there is almost no @xmath10 data of any kind .",
    "this component of the neutron sum rule is therefore purely a prediction , based upon amplitudes extracted from the @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath8 channels .",
    "interestingly , these amplitudes conspire to cancel in the said solution , giving a negligible @xmath12 contribution to the neutron sum rule above about 1  gev .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath8 contributions from said and maid are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : g5 ] .",
    "we therefore find that the @xmath8 component mainly responsible for the qualitative agreement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2](a ) . both the said solution and data suggest an upward trend near 2  gev . examining the behavior of our fits at the high energy limit",
    ", we can not claim this to be more than an artifact . comparing our fits sm02 and sm05",
    ", the fit influenced by more recent high - energy elsa and jlab data ( sm05 ) displays a less pronounced upward trend .",
    "if the highest energy measurement is more than a fluctuation , it would signal a resonance contribution not contained in either the said pion - nucleon  @xcite or pion - photoproduction  @xcite analyses . given that a similar trend is not seen in the proton gdh data ,",
    "this resonance contribution would decay to @xmath13 much more readily than @xmath14 .    in summary , data that have been measured to verify",
    "the gdh sum rule may be equally valuable in understanding both resonance physics and the transition between resonance and regge dominated regions .",
    "the apparent cancellation of large multi - pion contributions to the proton gdh sum rule suggests an underlying principle which deserves further investigation .",
    "certainly it would be interesting to extend the single - pion analysis in order to see how high in energy the trend of fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] continues .",
    "work on this project is in progress .",
    "the comparison of proton and neutron gdh data , versus the single - pion photoproduction contribution , suggests the existence of states coupling more strongly to @xmath13 than @xmath14 .",
    "these features should motivate further measurements of two - pion production , and single - meson photoproduction off the neutron .",
