    "continuos advancements in nanofabrication have permitted exploration and discovery new emergent physical phenomena when approaching the meso- and nanoscopic limit.@xcite the stability of the superconducting state under geometrical confinement is now intensively investigated due in part to anomalous mixed state in type - ii superconductors,@xcite as well as for reaching a better performance in their potential applications.@xcite unfortunately , one rarely witnesses the persistence of the non - dissipative regime up to the depairing current density @xmath1 , due to the current induced motion of magnetic flux quantum units ( abrikosov vortices ) and the consequent joule heating for currents above a critical current @xmath2 .",
    "the actual discrepancy between the theoretical expectation and the experimental fact has its origin in the largely neglected non - equilibrium phenomena occurring at the core of swiftly moving abrikosov vortices.@xcite one of these effects , taking place at intermediate current densities @xmath3 , consists of a deformation of the flux quanta core due to the slow healing time of the superconducting condensate after the passage of a vortex singularity in the condensate.@xcite as a consequence , a rapid moving vortex leaves behind a trail of depleted order parameter which further facilitates the motion of other vortices thus forming rivers of flux leading to a net increase of dissipation and triggering an abrupt transition from the abrikosov flux flow regime to the normal state.@xcite no matter which mechanism is responsible for this current instability,@xcite in this work we show that in the mesoscopic regime , the average critical velocity needed to trigger the instabilities is limited by a maximum speed value , that is not observed under no confinement .",
    "we investigate the so far totally unexplored mesoscopic regime where the scenario based on pinning disorder is of no application due to the fact that we use an extremely weak pinning superconducting material , @xmath0ge , in which free flux flow has been recently confirmed.@xcite many studies have been carried out in order to address other possible competing effects such as the influence of pinning properties of the intrinsic material @xcite and the artificially structured superconductors.@xcite neverthelss , in all these cases the geometry of the test sample has been kept on a macroscopic scale . here",

    "in the framework of vortex dynamics we identify the limiting behavior of the abrikosov lattice stability driven at high vortex velocity in the absence of bulk pinning , with the only constrain of confined mesoscopic geometry . the possibility to reach a maximum critical velocity as a function of the applied magnetic field",
    "is naturally explained by the tdgl phenomenological approach , which allows us to give a complete view of nonequilibrium vortex phases tunable by the external magnetic field and/or the bias current in a dynamic phase diagram . in a mesoscopic superconductor the physical meaning of such speed limit to the abrikosov vortex velocity is strictly connected to the presence of a surface pinning , namely an edge barrier , which first hampers and then delays the lattice motion , due to the rearrangement of vortices configuration in rows - like flow rather than keeping the usual ordered triangular vortex lattice in motion . to visualize it , real - space images of the driven lattice show that motion occurs along channels that are aligned with the direction of the driving force and",
    "periodically spaced in the transverse direction .",
    "phase slips , however , occur at the channel boundaries , indicating that channels become uncorrelated at very high driving current , before the instability takes place . in our case",
    "those channels may exist only at a velocity @xmath113 , that is the speed limit for the moving abrikosov lattice .",
    "the sequence in which these dynamical phases appear at high bias currents is usually nontrivial , and the simplified models of vortices as pointlike classical particles seem to have missed what a more realistic approach based on tdgl formalism is able to catch.@xcite    a further comparison of data on weak @xmath0ge superconductor with the bulk pinning effects in nbn surprisingly led to similar results , thus conferring to our findings even more generality .",
    "our results demonstrate that geometric reduction on mesoscopic scale can radically change the dissipative regimes in superconducting materials , thus improving the performance of those devices based on superconducting nanostructures .",

    "<S> we study the instability of the superconducting state in a mesoscopic geometry for the low pinning material @xmath0ge characterized by a large ginzburg - landau parameter . we observe that in the current driven switching to the normal state from a nonlinear region of the abrikosov flux flow , the mean critical vortex velocity reaches a limiting maximum velocity as a function of the applied magnetic field . based on time dependent ginzburg - landau simulations we argue that the observed behavior is due to the high velocity vortex dynamics confined on a mesoscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> we build up a general phase diagram which includes all possible dynamic configurations of abrikosov lattice in a mesoscopic superconductor . </S>"
