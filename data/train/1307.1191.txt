    "pulse propagation through granular media has become a topic of intense theoretical , numerical , and experimental attention because it involves fundamental issues in nonlinear discrete systems , and because at the same time it is of major practical importance .",
    "when a granular chain of equal spherical granules without precompression and without gaps is hit at one end , a solitary wave travels down the chain essentially unchanged in time .",
    "this observation was first made by nesterenko  @xcite , who solved this nonlinear problem using an analytic continuum approximation and successfully compared his analytic solutions to numerical simulation results .",
    "experimental verification followed soon after  @xcite and later in  @xcite .",
    "the way in which a pulse propagates along a chain is strongly dependent on the characteristics of the granules  @xcite . by modifying such a chain in various ways , e.g. , by tapering , including large and small masses , adding impurities to the chain , and other such manipulations , it was soon realized that it is possible to control exactly how the pulse energy behaves as it propagates  @xcite or becomes trapped with slow leakage  @xcite .",
    "this control offers the possibility of designing granular media with carefully chosen shock absorption or signal propagation properties .",
    "other interesting configurations leading to solitary wave train formation were explored  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of optimizing granular configurations for clean reflection of a pulse from a wall was studied as a tool for nonintrusive or nondestructive sensors  @xcite . these and many other applications were discussed and reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the effects of various forms of friction on pulse propagation were analyzed in  @xcite , including the observation of entirely new waveforms as a result of momentum - conserving frictional forces .",
    "on the theoretical front , a quantitatively accurate theory was first developed three decades ago for chains made up of identical spherical granules with no precompression and no gaps  @xcite .",
    "this approach was difficult to generalize to other granular configurations .",
    "as an alternative , we developed a theory based on a binary collision approximation ( bca ) which has been generalized to tapered , and decorated chains in various initial states and even to chains with some random configurational elements  @xcite .",
    "this theory has been quantitatively accurate in many cases , and forms the basis for the discussion in this paper .",
    "experiments on granular chains has been restricted by the constraints of particular experimental setups .",
    "analytic work can overcome such strictures and is helpful in expanding our fundamental understanding of these systems .",
    "the methods we have recently developed  @xcite have proved broadly applicable to chains of a variety of configurations .",
    "our analytic bca works remarkably well not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "even though the bca is restricted to conservative chains ( elastic collisions ) , and real granular collisions are not entirely elastic , the bca is nevertheless able to capture experimentally observed dynamics of chains of very hard spheres moving along very highly polished channels .",
    "this is the case with the experiments in the references cited above .",
    "why would one want to study chains of these particular configurations ( such as tapered or decorated ) ?",
    "in addition to questions of theoretical interest , the reason is that such physical arrangements of granules provide the opportunity to optimize the shock absorption properties of the system , and it is hoped that what one learns in one dimension can guide the inquiries in more realistic higher dimensional systems .",
    "it is quite surprising how exquisitely sensitive the transmittal of energy and/or momentum along a chain can be to details of chain granule configuration .",
    "the characterization of energy and momentum propagation along a granular chain is in itself quite varied .",
    "for instance , one might ask how long it takes the maximum of a pulse to reach a given granule . or one might wish to know how long the pulse maximum resides on a particular granule , or how much energy is focused on that granule during this time of residence .",
    "one might wish to know what happens to the width of a pulse as it travels along a chain , whether or not the pulse retains its integrity , and one might wish to predict whether or not the chain will fragment in the process .",
    "particular quantities of interest in the assessment of shock absorption properties of these simplified one - dimensional granular systems are the momentum and energy with which a pulse that starts at one end of a granular chain would first hit a wall at the other end . in our earlier work we focused on the pulse velocity amplitude and on the time that the pulse spends on each granule before moving on to the next granule .",
    "the bca assumes that the traveling pulse resides on only two granules at a time , so that the many - body problem of a fully interacting chain is reduced to an iterated solution of successive two - body problems .",
    "the approximation is straightforwardly implemented for monodisperse  @xcite and tapered chains  @xcite . for decorated chains , that is , chains of large ( possibly tapered ) grains separated by one or more small granules , it is first necessary to replace the chain by an effective monodisperse or tapered one to which the approximation can then be applied  @xcite .",
    "the approximation relies on the assumption that the traveling pulse is very narrow , which holds for many granular geometries ( including spherical granules ) . within the binary collision approximation",
    ", we were able to make exceptionally good predictions for certain pulse properties",
    ". however , not every prediction of the bca is equally quantitatively accurate . in particular , even though the change of the velocity of the particles , @xmath0 , as a pulse moves along a chain of granules labeled by @xmath1 is predicted extremely accurately , the bca consistently over - estimates the actual value @xmath2 of the velocity amplitude itself .",
    "the reason is that in reality the pulse does not reside precisely on only two granules at a time because the interactions are not hard - sphere .    in this work",
    "we focus on correcting the error made in the calculation of the velocities of the granules during pulse propagation along a chain of initially uncompressed spherical grains that just touch each other , which in turn affects our predictions for momentum and energy propagation .",
    "as we shall see , the corrections are mild but important .",
    "we introduce corrections that are partly analytical and partly numerical , and that provide a set of tools for further quantitative prediction .    before launching into our presentation",
    "we clarify a point that might otherwise appear puzzling .",
    "as the energy pulse travels down our various chains , we observe that the momentum and energy appear not to be conserved . the momentum may grow or decay , and the energy may appear constant or in fact may also decay .",
    "this occurs because we are specifically focusing on the pulse that carries energy forward . at each collision event",
    ", there may also be a backscattering of granules that also carry energy and momentum , and it may also happen that some portion of the energy may lag behind in the grains behind the pulse . when this is taken into account , all is as it should be with energy and momentum conservation .",
    "we organize our presentation as follows . in sec .",
    "[ oldequations ] we briefly recap the equations of motion that form the basis of all the work to follow . in sec .",
    "[ back ] we present the results of our previous calculations for backward tapered chains and in sec .  [ for ] for forward tapered chains . in sec .",
    "[ newresults ] we discuss the corrections that lead to more accurate predictions for energy and momentum propagation along tapered chains .",
    "section  [ collection ] is a summary of our results .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional chain of spherical granules  @xcite of density @xmath3 , labeled by index @xmath1 , with radius @xmath4 and mass @xmath5 .",
    "the equation of motion for the displacement @xmath6 of the @xmath1th granule as a function of time @xmath7 is @xmath8 with @xmath9^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath10 a constant determined by young s modulus and poisson s ratio .",
    "the heaviside function @xmath11 ensures that the elastic interaction between grains only exists if they are in contact .",
    "initially the granules just touch their neighbors in their equilibrium positions , that is , there is no pre compression and there are no gaps , and all but the leftmost particle are at rest .",
    "the initial velocity of the leftmost particle , @xmath12 , is @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to define scaled variables and parameters as follows , @xmath14 with @xmath15    equation  ( [ motion1 ] ) can then be rewritten in the cleaner form , which we use for all subsequent analysis , @xmath16 with @xmath17^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the rescaled initial velocity is unity , @xmath18 , as is the mass @xmath19 and the radius @xmath20 of the first granule .",
    "the velocity of the @xmath1th granule in unscaled variables is simply @xmath13 times its velocity in the scaled variables .",
    "the equations of motion can be integrated numerically .",
    "all of our previous results are obtained beginning from this starting point .    in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we went on to solve these equations of motion using an approximation that we called the binary collision approximation ( bca ) .",
    "the approximation is based on the assumption that the transfer of energy along the chain occurs via a succession of two - particle collisions .",
    "particle @xmath12 of unit velocity collides with initially stationary particle @xmath21 , which then acquires velocity @xmath22 and collides with initially stationary particle @xmath23 , and so on .",
    "the velocities after each collision can easily be obtained from conservation of energy and momentum .",
    "this scheme is straightforward to implement if the chain is monodisperse or if it is tapered forward ( decreasing radii ) or backward ( increasing radii ) .",
    "if the chain is  decorated \" with small grains among large ones , then the decorated chain must first be replaced by a carefully constructed effective chain of the monodisperse or tapered variety to which the bca can then be applied . here",
    "we exhibit the final full analytic bca result , which requires the application of a particular tapering protocol for further implementation in later sections .",
    "the velocity according to the bca is @xmath24 together with the mass @xmath25 this will then yield the pulse momentum @xmath26 and the pulse energy @xmath27 .",
    "as stated above , the bca works very well for some quantities but is not quantitatively correct in its prediction of the pulse velocity .",
    "this quantitative discrepancy between approximate and exact results thus leads to errors in the prediction of the momentum and the energy of the pulse ; the energy dependence on the square of the velocity of course magnifies the problem .",
    "we thus searched for a way to improve the theory .",
    "we call this improvement a  modified \" theory . in the next two sections we simply present , without re - deriving , the results of the original bca ( in scaled variables ) relevant to this discussion .",
    "the modified theory is then presented in sec .",
    "[ newresults ] .",
    "we start with a collection of the results obtained for backward tapered chains using the bca .",
    "backward tapered chains are alignments of granules of progressively increasing size and/or mass .",
    "we assume that the granules are all made of the same material , so that they have the same density and elastic properties .",
    "we study two different rules for the way that the radii @xmath28 increase along the chain , whose granules are labeled by index @xmath1 . in linearly tapered chains , the radii increase arithmetically , @xmath29 while exponential tapering is one in which the radii increase geometrically , @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the tapering parameters . here , the radii of the particles are given in units of the radius of the leftmost granule ( the impacting granule ) .",
    "the subscripts stand for  backward linear \" and  backward exponential \" respectively .      using energy and momentum conservation",

    "the superscript indicates that these are results of the original _ unmodified _ bca theory . on the other hand , since @xmath35 for any configuration , @xmath36 the masses of the granules are given in units of the mass of the leftmost particle .",

    "fig : e - k - exp - log - forward],width=359 ]    we end this section by assessing the behavior of the kinetic energy and momentum for the different tapering configurations .",
    "first we notice that the kinetic energy is almost constant ( after a short transient ) for both linearly tapered chains , while it decays exponentially for both of the exponentially tapered chains .",
    "thus , if one wishes to distribute the energy more uniformly or minimize the energy first arriving at the end of the chain , one should choose an exponentially tapered ( in either direction ) chain .",
    "the momentum , on the other hand , increases for backward tapered chains , but decreases for forward tapered chains .",
    "therefore , if one wants to build a shock absorber , one should choose a forward tapered chain .",
    "moreover , exponentially tapered chains are better candidates for this purpose since they lead to an exponential decrease of the momentum , in contrast with the linear decay in the linearly tapered chains .",
    "although the binary collision approximation correctly captures the trends of increase or decrease of the kinetic energy and momentum , the actual values of these quantities are not always in sufficient agreement with the results obtained from the numerical integration of the equations of motion to be of predictive value . in this section we propose a numerical rescaling of the velocity predicted by the bca which leads to quantitatively satisfactory predictors for the kinetic energy and momentum .",
    "our error estimates are in part , but only in part , numerical in the sense that the dependence of the corrections on the tapering parameters is given analytically .",
    "we thus propose corrections that can then be used for all appropriate situations once the tapering - parameter - independent coefficients and exponents have been determined numerically once and for all .",
    "as noted above , the bca successfully captures the qualitative behavior of the maximum velocity of the grains as the pulse moves along the chain . in proposing a correction that will improve the quantitative agreement with numerical simulations",
    ", we have therefore assumed that the functional dependence ( exponential or power law ) of the velocity @xmath2 on the grain position @xmath1 is correct as given by the theory , and that the quantitative differences arise because the constants that characterize these functional dependences require adjustment .",

    "<S> we study momentum and energy propagation in 1d tapered chains of spherical granules which interact according to a hertz potential . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we apply the binary collision approximation , which is based on the assumption that transfer of energy along the chain occurs via a succession of two - particle collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although the binary theory correctly captures the trends of increase or decrease of kinetic energy and momentum , the actual values of these quantities are not in good quantitative agreement with those obtained by numerically integrating the full equations of motion . to address this difficulty we have developed a mixed numerical / analytical correction algorithm to provide an improved estimate of the velocity of the particles during pulse propagation </S>",
    "<S> . with this corrected velocity </S>",
    "<S> we are in turn able to correctly predict the momentum and kinetic energy along the chain for several tapering configurations , specifically for forward linear , forward exponential , backward linear and backward exponential tapering . </S>"
