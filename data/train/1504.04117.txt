    "a lot of charmonium - like states have been reported in the past decade by the experiment collaborations such as belle , @xmath11 , cdf , d0 , lhcb , besiii , and cleoc .",
    "the underlying structures of many charmonium - like states are not very clear .",
    "sometimes they are called as xyz states .",
    "they decay into conventional chromium , but not all of them can be accommodated into the quark - model charmonium spectrum .",
    "the neutral xyz states include @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , and @xmath17 @xcite etc .",
    "there are also many charged charmonium - like states such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the charged bottomonium - like states @xmath24 and @xmath25 were observed by belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "theoretical speculations of these xyz states include the hybrid meson @xcite , tetraquark states @xcite , dynamically generated resonance @xcite and molecular states @xcite etc . since many of these xyz states are close to the thresholds of a pair of charmed or bottom mesons , the molecular hypothesis seems a natural picture for some of these states .    within the framework of the molecular states",
    ", there exist extensive investigations of the charged @xmath26 and @xmath27 states @xcite . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we explored the possibility of @xmath21 as the isovector molecule partner of @xmath12 and considered the recoil correction and the spin - orbit force in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 system very carefully .",
    "although there exist quite a few literatures on the possibility of @xmath23 as the @xmath30 molecular state and @xmath25 as the @xmath31 molecular state , most of the available investigations are either based on the heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry or derived in the @xmath32 . in other words , the recoil correction and the spin - orbit interaction have not been investigated for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 systems .",
    "since the binding energies of these system are very small , the high order recoil correction and the spin - orbit interaction may lead to significant corrections .    in this work , we will go one step further .",
    "we will consider the recoil correction and the spin - orbit force for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 systems .",
    "with the one - boson - exchange model ( obe ) , we will derive the effective potential with the relativistic lagrangian and keep the momentum related terms explicitly in order to derive the recoil correction and the spin - orbit interaction up to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass of the heavy meson .",
    "we investigate the @xmath31 system with @xmath35 for @xmath25 , and the @xmath30 system with @xmath36 for @xmath23 . for completeness",

    "compared to the @xmath28 case , the expressions of the recoil corrections and spin orbit force are more complicated . there",
    "appear several new structures .",
    "for some systems , the numerical results show that the high order correction is important for the loosely bound heavy - meson states .",
