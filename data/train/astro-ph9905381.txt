    "the systematic study of quasar absorption is a powerful cosmological tool . given a bright enough illuminating source and a combination of observations from the ground and space , the properties of the absorbers can be studied over 90 - 95% of the hubble time .",
    "sharp intervening absorption features are used to locate cold , diffuse and dark components of the universe  the traditional view is that and doublets are tracers of the halos of luminous galaxies ( @xcite ) and  lines are tracers of intergalactic hydrogen ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent work has blurred the distinction between the types of absorbers , and has given us a much more sophisticated and complex view of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the rapid evolution in the subject over a ten year span is amply conveyed by the contents of the two conference proceedings edited by blades , turnshek & norman ( 1988 ) and petitjean & charlot ( 1997 ) .",
    "the study of quasar absorbers is an important complement to galaxy surveys which catalog the luminous content of the universe . for suitable background sources",
    ", quasar absorbers can be detected over the range @xmath14 with an efficiency that is almost independent of redshift .",
    "galaxy surveys are inevitably affected by malmquist bias , surface brightness selection effects , cosmological dimming , and k - corrections . on the other hand",
    ", absorbers can only be surveyed along lines of sight with a suitable quasar , so most measures of large scale structure must use the one dimensional redshift distribution of absorbers .",
    "high redshift quasars show a dense `` forest '' of  absorption lines , first recognized to be discrete intervening absorbers by lynds ( 1972 ) .",
    "the observational situation at @xmath15 has been transformed by the high resolution and sensitivity of the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope .",
    "since the distribution of h i column density is a power law , the demarcation of the   forest is somewhat arbitrary  we adopt @xmath16 @xmath6 , where the absorbers are optically thin in the lyman continuum .",
    "surveys for the c iv doublet show that the metallicity of the hydrogen absorbers is a few percent of solar from 10@xmath17 @xmath6 down to 10@xmath18 @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the metal abundance drops sharply by an order of magnitude below 10@xmath18 @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the clustering properties also depend on column density .",
    "a two - point velocity correlation is detectable above 10@xmath18 @xmath6 ( although well below the level of galaxy - galaxy correlations ) and is much weaker or absent at lower column densities ( @xcite ) .",
    "both of these observations can be understood in the context of cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics .",
    "these supercomputer simulations show that the   absorbers trace a filamentary network of highly ionized gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at @xmath19 , a majority of the baryons in the universe",
    "are contained in the absorbers of the   forest ( @xcite ) . at column densities above 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ,",
    "the absorbers are roughly spherical and trace the skeleton of the large scale structure defined by collapsed objects . at column densities below 10@xmath4 @xmath6 , the absorbers are underdense and form a web of filaments and sheets ( @xcite ) .",
    "a column density of 10@xmath18 @xmath6 corresponds approximately to the transition between these two regimes .",
    "the insights from simulations affect the interpretation of quasar spectra .",
    "it is clear that the idea of a spherical cloud or even a `` characteristic '' size is naive  the absorbers trace a complex topology .",
    "the low column density absorbers are particularly interesting for cosmological studies , because they accurately trace the underlying dark matter potential and may be primitive enough to retain a memory of initial conditions , in contrast to highly non - linear objects like galaxies .",
    "croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum of mass fluctuations can be recovered directly from observations of the  forest ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the hydrogen absorbers at low redshift is not clear . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the   line shifts below the atmospheric cutoff and quasar spectra can only be obtained with the relatively modest aperture of the hubble space telescope .",
    "also , the number density of absorbers drops rapidly with redshift so the line samples are relatively small at low redshift .",
    "the evolution with redshift shows an inflection at @xmath21 ; data from the hst absorption line key project show strong evolution at high redshift and much weaker evolution for the 2/3 of a hubble time since @xmath22 ( jannuzi 1997 ) . in detail",
    ", there is differential evolution at low redshift  strong lines evolve , and lines near a rest equivalent width of 0.24   show no evolution ( dobrzycki & bechtold 1997 ) .    the strong lines at low redshift ( @xmath23 ) appear clustered in velocity space with an amplitude similar to that of galaxy - galaxy correlations ( ulmer 1996 ) .",
    "additional evidence for clustering comes from the hst key project , where  absorbers are clumped around metal line systems ( bahcall et al . 1996 ; jannuzi 1997 ) .",
    "nothing is known about the clustering of the unevolving weak lines , but a few high sensitivity spectra show that there are a large number of lines below 0.24   ( which corresponds to a column density of 10@xmath18 @xmath6 for a doppler parameter of 30 ) . at @xmath24 in the local universe ,",
    "the number density rises from @xmath25 above 10@xmath18 @xmath6 to @xmath26 above 10@xmath27 @xmath6 ( shull 1997 ) .",
    "low redshift absorbers offer the great advantage that galaxy counterparts can be detected directly .",
    "if a single galaxy is responsible , the most plausible counterpart is a luminous galaxy with a small impact parameter to the line of sight and a small velocity separation from the absorber ( lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; chen et al .",
    "1998 , clwb hereafter ) . however , it is difficult to identify a unique counterpart since galaxies cluster in space and there are many faint galaxies for each luminous one .",
    "there is an ambiguity between a luminous galaxy and an invisible dwarf at a smaller impact parameter ( linder 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the velocity resolution of most published hst spectroscopy is only 200 - 300 , leading to an ambiguity between an absorber that samples the velocity dispersion of a halo or the rotation of a massive disk , and an absorber that is part of a quiescent structure like a loose group of galaxies .",
    "this issue is highlighted by the study of quasar pairs , which show common   absorption at intermediate redshift ( @xmath28 ) with zero velocity difference on transverse scales far larger than a galaxy halo ( dinshaw et al .",
    "in addition to looking for a single counterpart , pencil - beam redshift surveys are used to statistically relate the one - dimensional absorber distribution to the three - dimensional galaxy distribution .",
    "morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) made the first detailed study of   absorbers and galaxies along the single line of sight toward 3c  273 .",
    "they concluded that the absorbers were more clustered than a random population but less clustered than galaxies were with each other .",
    "different studies have disagreed on the strength of the relationship that would point to bright galaxy counterparts  an anticorrelation between   equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter ( lanzetta et al . 1995 ; le brun , bergeron , & boiss 1996 ; bowen , blades & pettini 1996 ) . using hst data sensitive to column densities above 10@xmath18 @xmath6",
    ", these authors find that the fraction of absorbers associated with galaxies ( either within a halo or in a correlated structure ) is @xmath29 = 0.3 - 0.7 .",
    "the story is quite different when using hst data that is sensitive to lines of lower column density . at @xmath30 , where galaxy surveys are sensitive and relatively complete , the fraction of weak absorbers that are associated with galaxies is @xmath29 = 0 - 0.2 ( mo & morris 1994 ; shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ; grogin & geller 1998 ) .",
    "low column density absorbers appear to be unclustered and uncorrelated with galaxies .",
    "many questions about the low redshift   absorbers remain unanswered .",
    "are they kinematically linked to galaxies or are they merely tracers of large , unrelaxed structures ?",
    "is there a sharp transition in properties such as metallicity and ionization at a column density of 10@xmath18 @xmath6 ? how are they related to the rapidly evolving population of absorbers at higher redshift ?",
    "some insights have been provided by the first hydrodynamic simulations to predict absorber properties at @xmath31 .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the  forest arises primarily from shock - heated gas associated with the large scale structures surrounding the galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the absorber is governed by the trade - off between the declining recombination rate due to the expansion of the universe and the photoionization rate , which declines sharply due to the fading ultraviolet background at @xmath32 ( see also riediger , petitjean & m@xmath33cket 1998 ; theuns , leonard , & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "absorbers with column densities above 10@xmath18 @xmath6 may sample a population of absorbers that is rapidly evolving as the gas drains onto galaxies and filaments . at low redshifts ,",
    "the residue of this gas would display much of the clustering power of galaxies .",
    "lower column density absorbers may sample gas in void regions , and consequently these slowly evolving absorbers would be less chemically enriched and less clustered .",
    "this paper presents new observations of   absorbers at low redshift ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the approach is to use multiple lines of sight in a single region of sky to thread a large , contiguous volume . in this way",
    ", absorbers can be compared with individual galaxies down to a low luminosity limit .",
    "the target area is the virgo region , chosen because it contains a significant number of background probes and because the galaxy distribution is reasonably well sampled  in addition to the virgo cluster and the southern extension of the coma cluster at @xmath35 , there is a sheet of galaxies at least 150 mpc in extent at @xmath36 ( flint & impey 1996 ) .",
    "we have used the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) to detect 139  absorbers in the redshift range @xmath37 .",
    "the total volume threaded by the 10 pencil beams is 3 @xmath38 mpc@xmath39 .",
    "several other studies have presented low redshift   absorbers along widely separated , and therefore unrelated , sightlines .",
    "the primary comparison sample comes from the hst key project ( bahcall et al . 1996 ;",
    "jannuzi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there have been several other studies of multiple sightlines ( stocke et al .",
    "1995 ; shull , stocke & penton 1996 ; grogin & geller 1998 ) and a couple of sensitive surveys of individual sightlines ( morris et al . 1993 ; tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present the new sample of low redshift  absorbers , summarize their statistical properties , and relate them to the individual galaxies .",
    "a deeper spectroscopic survey is underway to measure galaxy redshift in cones around each of the virgo sightlines .",
    "another eventual goal is to compare the spatial distribution of absorbers and galaxies to the results of hydrodynamic simulations of the local universe . in  2 , we discuss the new hst observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "the line selection and identification process is discussed in  3 . following that we describe in  4 the statistical properties of the  absorbers and compare the data to other published samples . in ",
    "5 we relate the absorbers to the luminous matter distribution defined by galaxies .",
    "the paper ends with a brief discussion of the nature of the low redshift hydrogen absorbers .",
    "most of what we know about  absorbers at @xmath40 comes from studies of single lines of sight .",
    "this information can be combined to produce absorber samples with great statistical power ; this approach is exemplified by the hst key project ( jannuzi et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) .",
    "the transverse scale of the absorbers can be measured by looking for common absorption along adjacent lines of sight .",
    "experiments using gravitational lenses and quasar pairs probe scales from 100 pc up to 1 mpc ( e.g. weymann & foltz 1983 ; fang et al . 1996 ; petry , impey , & foltz 1998 ; dinshaw et al .",
    "however , the low optical depth to lensing and the low surface density of bright quasars mean that these asterisms are rare .",
    "the connection between galaxies and absorbers can be established with galaxy redshift surveys along individual lines of sight .",
    "but the field of view of multi - object spectrographs is too small to relate absorbers to large scale structure in this way .",
    "we favored a hybrid strategy in this study of  absorbers at very low redshift , @xmath34 .",
    "the well - sampled galaxy distribution in the direction of virgo provides an excellent opportunity to study the relationship of  absorbers not only to individual bright galaxies but also to the large scale structure traced by those galaxies .",
    "the virgo region is covered by the large bright quasar survey , ensuring a suitable grid of probes ( @xcite ) .",
    "target quasars were selected by their location on the sky and in redshift , by their estimated 1300   flux , and by the number of galaxies detected along the line of sight .",
    "target quasars were chosen to span a large region centered on the virgo cluster on the sky ( @xmath41 : 12@xmath42 to 13@xmath42 ; @xmath43 ) .",
    "we adopted a lower redshift bound of @xmath44 for the target quasar , to give a pathlength of @xmath45 for galaxy - absorber comparison , and an upper redshift bound of @xmath46 , to avoid the likelihood of lyman limit absorption in quasars without previous ultraviolet photometry or spectroscopy .",
    "the final target list contains one exception of a quasar at @xmath36 whose ultraviolet brightness offset the increased amount of time required to detect the necessary number of  lines in the smaller redshift pathlength .",
    "quasars were selected from the vron catalog ( @xcite ) , with preference given to targets with at least 40 galaxies ( @xmath47 ) within a radius of 2 degrees out to @xmath48 .",
    "this generous criterion chose lines of sight that had a minimum sample of detected galaxies ( i.e. with or without a measured redshift ) within a large volume around each line of sight , taking galaxies from an early version of the cfa redshift catalog ( zcat ) ca .",
    "1994 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath47 was a conservative limit to ensure data existed in the literature , and in fact , using our current galaxy sample from the virgo region ( a combination of zcat version november 1998 , and ned , defined in  5.1 ) , only 12/100 randomly generated lines of sight within our overall region would have @xmath49 out to @xmath48 .",
    "the two exceptions are quasars in the direction of the southern extension of the virgo cluster , where @xmath50 .",
    "the candidate target list was further refined to exclude radio loud quasars which could prove to be variable , as well as those quasars expected to have low ultraviolet flux .",
    "nine of the ten remaining quasars had no uv observations in the literature .",
    "the tenth object , pks  1217 + 1804 , had been observed with iue ( @xcite ) .",
    "eight of the nine objects were observed optically with the multiple mirror telescope in march and april of 1995 to measure an individual spectral index for each object , which was subsequently used to extrapolate to a 1300   flux ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the remaining unobserved object , q1214 + 1804 , is an optically selected quasar and had a high probability of having a reliable extrapolated flux calculated from an average of our optical spectral indices ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we required the quasars to have an expected 1300   flux greater than @xmath53 erg s@xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath2 ,  which was found to be the minimum flux needed to achieve the prescribed data quality . with uv flux level as an overall limitation",
    ", the hst observations were planned to yield a significant number of  absorbers along each line of sight .",
    "the expected number of  lines , @xmath54 , was evaluated using the absorber density relation from the maximum likelihood model of @xcite , assuming a @xmath55 limiting equivalent width and using a snr calculated from the 1300   flux .",
    "integration times were adjusted to maximize observing efficiency versus @xmath54 , yielding an average @xmath56 of 4 for @xmath57 , and an average @xmath56 of 9 over the whole accessible range @xmath3 .",
    "the actual yield was an average of @xmath58 @xmath1 lines per quasar over the 10 lines of sight .",
    "information on the final list of 10 target quasars and details of the observations is summarized in table .",
    "the snr of the ghrs spectra agree well with the predictions , except in two cases , mark  1320 and q  1228 + 1116 , which have very low snr  either the 1300   flux for these objects was underestimated or they are variable sources .",
    "these two objects are not included in the analysis .",
    "a search of the hst archive yielded two additional targets , 3c  273 and j  1230.8 + 0115 , which were observed using the same instrumental configuration .",
    "the snr for these two targets is higher than for the other 10 objects and so they are included in our analysis to enhance the statistics .",
    "the details of these observations are also included in table .",
    "spectroscopy of 10/12 quasars listed in table was obtained with the hubble space telescope ghrs ( post - costar ) using the side 1 digicon detector with the large science aperture ( lsa ) and the g140l grating ( see table for the observational details ) .",
    "this configuration yields a wavelength coverage of 12001480  , which is sensitive to  absorption from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . because the side 1 acquisition mirror of the ghrs only reflects far - ultraviolet light , the targets were too faint to accumulate enough counts over the maximum acquisition integration time , and",
    "so the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) blue - side mirror was used to acquire the objects .",
    "acquisitions were made with the 4.3  fos aperture then followed with a blind offset to the ghrs 2  lsa for observations .",
    "such fos - assisted ghrs acquisitions have a pointing uncertainty of 01 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the g140l grating produces a dispersion of 0.57   @xmath61 and the instrumental fwhm ( ) is 1.40 diodes ( ghrs instrument handbook v6.0 ) . to obtain full nyquist sampling , the observations are substepped into quarter - diode steps , providing 4 pixels per diode and thus a dispersion of @xmath62   pixel@xmath2 , and spectral resolution of @xmath63 pixels or 0.80  .",
    "furthermore , to account for the granularity of the diodes and increase the snr , the observations were split into 4 subexposures , rotating the grating carousel by @xmath64 diodes per subexposure .",
    "the reduced spectra are shown in figure .",
    "the data were re - reduced with the standard ghrs data pipeline , implementing updated calibration files from july 1997 . in particular",
    ", the grating sensitivity and the lsa incidence angles have been recently recalibrated for the g140l , so the newest references were used .",
    "the ghrs reduction pipeline includes a correction to the wavelength scale for heliocentric velocities .",
    "the default wavelength scale , which has proven to be very stable ( @xcite ) , has a maximum rms dispersion of 55 m  for this grating .",
    "the largest source of wavelength error was the thermal variation in the spectrograph , with the g140l showing the greatest temperature sensitivity of all the ghrs gratings .",
    "these variations resulted in significant zero - point shifts , which typically were corrected with intermediate czptne wavelength calibration exposures .",
    "the cross - correlation , however , between these calibration exposures and an artificially created czptne spectrum yielded unsatisfactory offsets and large errors .",
    "the offsets can be calculated independently from the galactic absorption lines present in the spectra using the algorithm described in  3.2 .",
    "this method assumes that the gas causing the galactic absorption is at rest within the lsr ( @xmath65 ) . although some lines of sight may pierce high - velocity clouds , inducing potential variation in @xmath66 on the order of @xmath67 , average lsr velocities measured from hi emission by the hst key project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) are typically on the order of @xmath68 .",
    "however , this is much smaller than the instrumental resolution ( 0.8  , or 195  at 1230  ) , in addition to being smaller than the match window used in the line identification process ( see  3.2 for details ) .",
    "the combined @xmath69 errors in the wavelength solution are well represented by the dispersion in the zero - point offsets for each spectrum , with a typical value of 18 .",
    "these @xmath69 errors ( rms ) of the offset for each individual spectrum are included in table 1 .",
    "line - profile fitting is the simplest and most direct way to detect and measure quasar absorption lines .",
    "line - profile fitting implicitly assumes that the regions causing the absorption are discrete structures in thermodynamic equilibrium which are well described by the chosen profile .",
    "however , supercomputer simulations have shown that the structure of the absorbing regions is complex and filamentary , and the gas is subject to a wide variety of dynamical processes , each of which has an influence on the resultant spectral profile ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the entire notion of a `` cloud '' is inappropriate ; at the lowest column densities the hydrogen distribution tends towards a diffuse and smoothly fluctuating intergalactic medium ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; kirkman & tytler 1997 ) .",
    "absorption features studied in higher resolution ghrs g160 m data ( @xcite ) are well fit by voigt profiles and so their doppler parameters may be inferred . however , at the resolution of the ghrs g140l data ( @xmath70  ) , any thermal or turbulent imprint on the line profiles will not be resolved .",
    "this assumes that the doppler parameter distribution at low redshift is similar to that found found at high redshift using very high resolution spectra ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . at low redshift ,",
    "the number density of absorbers is low enough that the spectral features are isolated and deblending is not an issue .",
    "a key feature of our analysis is the use of an automated line selection and fitting process that is reproducible and quantifiable .",
    "line - profile fitting requires identification of the continuum for the observed flux .",
    "typically , an accurate estimate of the continuum is limited by the cumulative effect of the increasing number of low column density lines which act to depress the continuum . however , at very low redshift this effect is negligible because the line density is low and the continuum can readily be located adjacent to each spectral feature .",
    "a continuum was fit for each of the 12 spectra using software designed for this purpose as well as for fitting line profiles .",
    "the software is a significant elaboration and modification of the algorithm of @xcite , which produces a self - consistent and repeatable result . for details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the continuum is fit by - hand in the region of the damped  absorption and geocoronal  emission features ; no subtraction of these features was attempted and adjacent regions ( @xmath71 ) were omitted from the analysis .",
    "the final continuum fits are overplotted on the reduced spectra in figure .",
    "the limiting equivalent width , @xmath72 , of each spectrum was computed as a function of wavelength in order to assess the quality of the data and to set limits for inclusion of lines in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the computation of @xmath72 is described in  3.2 .",
    "the 4.5@xmath72 detection limit is shown for each spectrum in figure for the wavelength range corresponding to @xmath73 .",
    "for comparison , the completeness level of 0.24   used by @xcite is overplotted and the tickmarks schematically indicate the location of  lines . note that the data for mark  1320 and q  1228 + 116 have detection limits that are too high to use in this study and , although line lists were developed , they were excluded from the analysis .    in order to select and measure the absorption features , we assume that the observed flux profiles are well represented by the convolution of a voigt profile with the line spread function of the ghrs g140l grating . to verify this , subroutines from the program autovp ( @xcite ) were used to generate flux profiles for  absorption lines with lower and upper limits for the expected doppler parameter , @xmath74 , and for a range of column densities , .",
    "the convolution of this intrinsic line profile with the instrumental line spread function is the expected line profile .",
    "if the distribution of doppler parameters at low redshift is similar to that at high redshift , the respective lower and upper limits are approximately 20  and 80  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the line spread function is essentially a gaussian distribution with @xmath75   ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by inspection",
    ", none of the absorption features in the 12 quasars in our sample had a central flux lower than @xmath58% of the continuum level , so we examined profiles computed for values of @xmath74 and  that resulted in this value for the central flux .",
    "we then compared them to a gaussian fit to the profile and found that the difference between the actual and fitted profiles was very small .",
    "in other words , given the the column densities and doppler widths of the absorbers and the resolution of the spectrograph , the instrumental profile dominates the intrinsic line profile in the resultant flux profile .",
    "we conclude that the use of a gaussian profile in fitting absorption features is appropriate for our purposes .",
    "line - profile fitting was performed by software based on the @xcite code .",
    "new algorithms for selecting and fitting lines as well as deblending were implemented , completely automating the process and eliminating `` by - hand '' intervention .",
    "@xcite used this software on a high redshift lensed quasar , where the line density was much higher and the width of the instrumental profile dominated the distribution of doppler parameters , so the fwhm was held constant ( all of the absorption lines are unresolved ) . in this work ,",
    "the intervening  lines are expected to be unresolved but some high ionization galactic lines may be resolved due to inflow and outflow processes ( savage , sembach & lu 1997 ) .",
    "we allow for resolved lines but restrict the minimum allowable fwhm to be , following the hst absorption line key project ( @xcite ) .",
    "even though our methodology differs slightly from that of the key project , similar results are produced in a direct comparison of line lists for the three objects in common .    in the simultaneous fitting phase ,",
    "the algorithm allowed variation of all three parameters which describe the gaussian . after fitting a particular combination of lines ,",
    "the program examined the fwhm for each component , and if any value for the fwhm fell below , the fwhm for that component was reset to .",
    "the fit was then performed again .",
    "this algorithm prevents fits to noise spikes , and sets a minimum allowable fwhm for real absorption lines which can not be narrower than the instrumental resolution .",
    "inspection of the distribution of velocity widths shows that a small fraction of the total number of lines have fwhm larger than 375   13 lines or 3.6% .",
    "six of these are strong lines identified with galactic and extragalactic metal line systems .",
    "the remaining seven lines yield an unphysically broad fwhm most likely due unresolved , blended components or because of the uncertainty in the continuum fit and noise .",
    "this small number of lines has a negligible impact on the analysis .",
    "given the average line density , the probability that two lines will fall close enough by chance to appear as a blend is only 2.6% .",
    "this is evidence that some of the lines with fwhm larger than instrumental resolution are truly resolved and are not the result of individual blended components .",
    "parameters fit for lines selected in each spectrum are listed in table .",
    "blended lines which were fit simultaneously to a feature have identical @xmath76 values .",
    "lines for which the quoted error in the fwhm is exactly zero are considered to be unresolved and were not varied in the final fit .",
    "five lines with significance lower than 3@xmath72 were removed from table .",
    "since a significance level of 3@xmath77 is low , we made a line by line comparison in the case of 3c  273 , the only object in our sample where a higher resolution spectrum is available .",
    "the only lines in the list of morris et al .",
    "( 1991 ) that do not appear in our line list are either very weak lines ( @xmath78 m ) , or they are very close blends that our g140l data could not separate .",
    "therefore , we recover lines as well as would be expected given the signal to noise and resolution .",
    "the lines that appear in our list that do not appear in the morris et al .",
    "list are used to estimate the false detection rate for very weak lines . in 3c  273 , our software recovers 29 lines above three times the 1@xmath77 limiting equivalent width ) .",
    "adopting the morris et al . spectrum as a `` truth '' spectrum ,",
    "five of these lines are false detections .",
    "this is a conservative estimate of our `` false '' detection rate , since these are all weak lines where the exact choice of continuum fit makes a substantial difference to the detectability ( and significance level ) of the line . using these numbers , we estimate that @xmath7910% stronger than 4.5@xmath72 might be false detections and @xmath7950% of the lines between 3@xmath72 and 4.5@xmath72 might be false . as we will see , this projects to no more than 16% possibly false lines in the  sample , a level of contamination that can not affect the main scientific conclusions of the paper .",
    "we include all lines in table 2 in the identification procedure .",
    "the total number of lines above 3@xmath72 is 357 , and the number above 4.5@xmath72 is 272 .",
    "a list of  lines for each quasar was created by removing lines from the observed lists that could be otherwise identified . because the spectra span the redshift range down to @xmath31 , a significant number of features are due to absorption by metal species in the galaxy",

    "lastly , we search for higher order lyman lines in systems which may or may not have associated metal lines .    candidate identifications for absorption lines were made by searching the line lists for matches to the comparison lines .",

    "two heavy element lines are found : the stronger component of the doublet ( the expected strength of the weaker component is below the detection threshold ) and @xmath93977 ( which was superceded by identification as galactic but may possibly be a blend . )",

    "the lines used in the detailed comparison with galaxies are all strong enough that the analysis in  5 is not affected by this issue .",
    "this dataset provides a unique opportunity to examine the properties of the  absorbers in the local universe .",
    "if these absorbers can be characterized by a random distribution , this would suggest that they have maintained their `` primeval '' state , and have not evolved gravitationally from their higher redshift counterparts .",
    "if they are clustered , then the gas may have collapsed into structures that are in some way related to galaxies . in this section",
    "we describe the general properties of the  absorbers , such as their number density and their distribution of equivalent widths .",
    "we also check for consistency with values measured from larger samples of data .",
    "the scale and amplitude of the clustering of the absorbers , compared to similar statistics for galaxies , can give clues to the origin and evolution of the structures .",
    "we use two statistics to address the hypothesis that the  absorbers are randomly distributed : the nearest neighbor distribution and the two - point correlation function ( tpcf ) .",
    "we then test the hypothesis that the  absorbers are clustered in the same way that galaxies are clustered by comparing the  tpcf to the tpcf measured for galaxies .      to check that our sample of  absorbers is representative of its parent population , the number of lines per redshift interval and the number distribution of rest equivalent widths is compared with values derived from a much larger sample of data by @xcite .",
    "the range in wavelength to be included in the analysis is determined at the blue end by obscuration due to the geocoronal  line , @xmath110 , and at the red end by the limit of the data , @xmath111 .",
    "the evolution in the number density of lines is undetectably small over this range , so we assume it to be constant .",

    "we count lines in our sample which are located in regions of the spectra which are complete to 0.24   for 4.5@xmath77 lines , and compute @xmath7 .",
    "the mean is an unweighted average , and the error is computed by combining in quadrature the poisson error in @xmath112 from each line of sight .",

    "the observed number of lines is compared to the number expected for each line of sight with a @xmath113 test and results in a probability of 15% that the @xmath113 would be larger than it is observed .",
    "this indicates that the scatter in the observed number of lines is greater than would be expected from an assumption of poisson errors .",
    "we interpret this marginal evidence for cosmic variance in the number of absorbers among the lines of sight .",
    "the typical transverse separation of any two sightlines is @xmath114 mpc .",
    "variations on such a large scale would be unprecedented for  absorbers , and this issue is worth revisiting with a larger data set .",
    "we note that the simulations of dav et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are not sensitive to structure on this scale due to the limited box size .",
    "evaluation of the significance of the results of the nearest neighbor distribution and the tpcf depends on computing a random distribution of absorbers using a monte carlo technique .",
    "the number of lines chosen for each realization depends on the extrapolation of the fitted distribution of the number of lines per interval redshift per interval rest equivalent width , @xmath115 , to the highest sensitivity limit , @xmath116 , of each spectrum .",
    "we can compare the extrapolated values with the observed values for low redshift @xmath112 measured at higher sensitivity limits from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their points are presented as a function of sensitivity limit , @xmath116 , in figure by solid symbols .",

    "also plotted is our computed value of @xmath112 for a completeness limit of 0.24  .",
    "note that the @xcite and @xcite measurements ( solid symbols ) are slightly higher than the key project extrapolation .",
    "to evaluate whether the extrapolation with @xmath116 breaks down at lower equivalent width thresholds , we compute a second point at a higher sensitivity limit from a subset of our data which has slightly larger errorbars ( open symbol ) .",
    "we also plot points at lower sensitivity limits quoted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that if there is a real increase in the number density of lines in excess of the extrapolation , it occurs only among the very weakest lines .",
    "it is also possible that the @xcite point samples a line of sight with an unusually high number of absorbers .",
    "we chose to use the extrapolation of @xcite in performing the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the nearest neighbor distribution is computed for the observed sample of 139 lines by finding the nearest neighbor in velocity space for every  absorption line along each line of sight , and plotting the frequency distribution of velocity splittings for all the lines of sight combined .",
    "the expected number of pairs in each bin due to a random distribution of  absorbers is determined by monte carlo simulation . even though the number of lines per unit redshift for the sample agrees with that of @xcite for all lines of sight",
    ", there is a variance in @xmath112 among the lines of sight as shown in    figure .",
    "therefore , to obtain the random distribution of velocity separations , the number of expected lines for each simulated line of sight must be drawn from a poisson distribution with a mean given by @xmath121 using fitted coefficients from @xcite , instead of using the observed number of lines per line of sight .",
    "this turns out to affect the amplitude of the nearest neighbor distribution in the smallest bins by about 25% .",
    "the nearest neighbor distribution expected for a random distribution of absorbers is computed 1000 times for a simulated set of 10 quasars having the measured 3@xmath72 detection threshhold .",
    "the number of lines per quasar is initially chosen by scaling @xmath112 using fitted coefficients by @xcite to the most sensitive part of each spectrum , @xmath116 . the finite resolution of the spectrograph is accounted for by not allowing any two lines to be closer than 2.5@xmath80 .",
    "this value was chosen based on simulations performed on the software to quantify the recovery reliability of input line parameters .",
    "we have previously performed this test for lower resolution higher redshift quasar spectra ( @xcite ) , where the recovery rate for input central wavelengths , fwhms and equivalent widths as a function of line strength , separation and snr was evaluated using a monte carlo technique . for a separation of 2.5@xmath80 ,",
    "the central wavelengths of the input lines were recovered to within @xmath122 99% of the time , and the equivalent widths were recovered to within 20% of the input value 95% of the time .    in order to use the maximum number of lines from the sample ,",
    "we account for the varying sensitivity of each spectrum in the simulation .",
    "each line was assigned a wavelength corresponding to a random location in space , then assigned an equivalent width drawn from an exponential distribution , again using the fitted coefficients of @xcite .",
    "for each simulated absorption feature , the assigned equivalent width was compared to the detection limit at its location in the spectrum , and was removed from the list if it was below the detection limit .",
    "this procedure simulates the entire observed line list with randomized locations .",
    "the distribution of velocity separations for the nearest neighbor pairs along each line of sight were computed for every realization and the mean number of pairs for each bin is the expected number for that bin .",
    "confidence intervals were evaluated by summing over the distribution of pairs in each bin .",
    "the bin size is set to be 250 , and the first bin is not meaningful because the resolution of the spectrograph limits sensitivity to about 210 .",
    "the results are shown in figure @xmath123 .",
    "the first two bins , corresponding to a velocity splitting of 250 - 750 , each show a clustering signal with greater than 95% confidence level .",
    "the amplitude of this clustering signal may have been underestimated by as much as @xmath7915% due to the contamination of the weakest lines with ( randomly distributed ) false detections .",
    "another way to evaluate the significance of this signal is to compute the probability that the observed and expected nearest neighbor distributions as a whole are drawn from the same random parent distribution .",
    "this can be estimated by forming the distribution of the variance between the mean expected distribution and each realization and is shown in figure @xmath74 .",
    "the variance for the observed distribution and the expected mean distribution is shown as a dotted line . only two out of the 1000 random realizations have a larger variance .",
    "we conclude that the probability that the observed distribution of nearest neighbor velocity separations is obtained from a random distribution of absorbers is very small .",
    "the tpcf along the line of sight is computed for the observed sample of lines with significance greater than @xmath124 .",
    "the tpcf , @xmath125 , is defined as @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the frequency distribution of observed velocity splittings of all pairs of absorbers along the lines of sight , and @xmath56 is the expected number of velocity splittings in each bin and is determined using a monte carlo technique .",
    "this process for computing @xmath127 is similar to the nearest neighbor distribution computation except instead of only the nearest line contributing a velocity splitting , all possible pairings of lines in a line of sight are computed .",
    "the results from all 10 lines of sight are combined to form @xmath127 .",
    "the distribution expected from a random population of absorbers is computed by monte carlo simulation in the same manner as for the nearest neighbor distribution . because the number of velocity pairings goes as @xmath128 , instead of with @xmath129 as with the nearest neighbor distribution , a slight difference in the normalization of the number of lines per line of sight makes a very large difference in the normalization of @xmath56 .",
    "since we are interested in the relative shapes of the distributions , the random distribution of velocity splittings , @xmath56 , is scaled so both distributions have equal numbers of velocity pairs . because of the finite length of the spectrum , the distribution @xmath56 has a slope due to the fall - off of pairs with larger separations . to account for this aliasing effect in the normalization",
    ", we sum over a velocity range corresponding to half the redshift range under study .",
    "this also corresponds to the velocity splitting where the number of observed pairs is zero in some bins .",
    "the tpcf is shown in figure .",
    "the 68% and 95% , confidence intervals are overplotted and were computed as for the nearest neighbor distribution .",
    "this statistic is , in principle , sensitive to clustering at all scales .",
    "but because all pairings are used , in practice it is not as sensitive as the nearest neighbor test to clustering at the smallest scales . added pairs produce added noise to all bins and any small scale clustering signal is diluted .    in order to test the hypothesis that galaxies are clustered like  absorbers are clustered",
    ", we compare our tpcf to that determined for bright galaxies .",
    "the measured tpcf for galaxies from @xcite is represented in figure for the smallest bins by black dots .",
    "we use a parameter choice of @xmath130 75  kpc in this comparison , appropriate to the observed coherence length of the absorbers at @xmath131 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if galaxies are clustered like  absorbers , they should have the same amplitude .",
    "figure indicates that while  absorbers have a marginal clustering signal for small velocity splittings ( almost 95% confidence level ) , galaxies clearly cluster much more strongly .",
    "the only two previous studies of the clustering of  absorbers at low redshift both use data obtained by the hst key project ( @xcite ) over the range @xmath132 .",
    "@xcite analyzed line lists from the first set of quasar spectra obtained by the key project with the hst s fos , and found no evidence for a strong correlation in the tpcf .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used the line lists from these inital observations plus a second set of line lists ( @xcite ) , for a total sample of 100 lines , to look for a clustering signal with the expanded set of data .",
    "he found a clustering signal that is similar in strength to that of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , @xmath133 , 90% confidence level , for separations of 250 - 500 .",
    "this work is the first observational study of clustering to focus on the local universe , @xmath134 , where the mean redshift corresponds to 15% of the lookback time compared to @xmath135% ( @xmath136 ) in previous work ; our total sample contains 139 lines compared to 15 found in this redshift range in the sample studied by @xcite .",
    "all ten of these lines of sight ( los ) were chosen for their position behind the virgo cluster region which provides an excellent opportunity to explore the galaxy - absorber connection in a well - studied region of varying density environments containing numerous surveys complete to faint limits .",
    "we constructed a sample of galaxies from the literature , using ned ( ca .",
    "october 1998 ) , supplemented with zcat ( version november 1998 ; @xcite ) , with ra from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , and declination from @xmath139to 19 , and radial velocity less than 3000 , which we will call the virgo galaxy sample although it encompasses more than just the virgo cluster proper . fitting a schechter luminosity function to the sample with a flat faint - end slope ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath141 , we find it to be complete to @xmath142 , containing galaxies as faint as smc - type dwarfs ( @xmath143 , adopting the more standard @xmath144 from @xcite ) .",

    "the galaxy distribution can be seen in figure , where the virgo sample galaxies are plotted in units of galaxy per unit magnitude and the schechter function is overplotted in the same units .",
    "the function was arbitrarily normalized to fit the turnover , and the error bars indicated are poisson .",
    "galaxy absolute magnitudes were calculated assuming pure hubble flow , with @xmath147 = 75 , with no virgo - centric infall model applied , since the virgo triple - value problem ( e.g. @xcite ) introduces scatter at all magnitudes and so will not greatly affect the shape of the luminosity function and thus the completeness limit .",
    "the quasar path lengths were likewise limited to  in the range @xmath148  3000 , using the same upper limit as the virgo sample , and excluding all possible lines below 900  due to interference by the geocoronal  emission ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "this yields 11  lines amongst the ten los , satisfying the 3@xmath77  limiting equivalent width criterion ( although they are all at least 4@xmath77  lines ) .",
    "the distribution of galaxies and absorbers can be seen in the pieplots in figure , where the declination range has been split up into three slices of @xmath149  each .",
    "the virgo sample of galaxies , as defined above , are plotted for @xmath143 out to @xmath150  .",
    "the ten lines of sight are also plotted with the open circles indicating the absorber positions ; the large circles are the 4.5@xmath77  lines , and the small circles are the remaining 3@xmath77  lines .",
    "the one - dimensional galaxy distributions along the lines of sight are indicated in figure .",
    "the distribution of @xmath151   galaxies within impact parameters @xmath152   175  mpc of each of the ten lines of sight can be seen as the unshaded histograms , and the galaxies falling within @xmath152   25075  kpc as the shaded histograms . the  lines in this range",
    "are also plotted , with the longer vertical bars representing @xmath1  lines and the shorter vertical bars @xmath0  lines .",
    "while limiting our comparison galaxy volume to the virgo region and to a shortened redshift range greatly diminishes our available spectral path length , it significantly increases the contiguous volume within which to compare to individual galaxies with a uniform luminosity limit . the typical distance between any two lines of sight within this volume is about 5 degrees , or 275  mpc , and",
    "the total volume probed is @xmath153 mpc@xmath154 .",
    "moreover , in addition to probing primarily the field galaxy population , we have the opportunity to probe a galaxy cluster environment down to very faint completeness levels .    in comparing absorbers and galaxies , we make no corrections for peculiar velocities , assuming they will share the same velocity field .",
    "however , the virgo cluster itself ( @xmath155 ; @xcite ) presents a special case , having a large velocity dispersion ( @xmath156 ; @xcite ) , and a possibly non - virialized structure ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this makes identifying an absorber with any galaxy in the virgo core ambiguous .",
    "however , only 3/10 lines of sight intersect the 6  virgo core ( following the definition of @xcite ) , and have no absorbers within the included 1@xmath77 velocity range of 9001700 . of these three los , only pg1211 + 143",
    "has an absorber with @xmath157 , one which falls in the 2@xmath77 tail of the virgo velocity distribution at 2160 .",
    "if absorbers follow the galaxies , one might expect a number of absorbers in the dense virgo core , but the small number statistics of this analysis and the exclusion of the low - velocity end of the core ( namely , 500 - 900 km s@xmath2 ) make the lack of absorbers less compelling",
    ". the remaining lines of sight all fall well beyond the virgo core , but within the maximum angle of influence in the @xcite virgocentric infall model ( 28 ) , the majority falling within 11  of the core . according to the model , the extrema of galaxy peculiar velocities caused by infall within 11   have a dispersion of roughly 350 - 400 . at the lowest velocities , this will only affect comparisons to one absorber ( 3c  273 : 1012 ) , and although this dispersion is on the order of the velocity - space window in the later galaxy - absorber pair analysis , our techniques may not give a reliable result for this one  line .      to pursue the relationship of absorbers to galaxy density , we compared the distribution of galaxy density at the absorber positions to the same distribution for randomly distributed absorbers .",
    "the galaxy number densities were counted in 275 mpc - radius spheres centered on the actual absorber positions .",
    "virgo sample galaxies were placed in three - dimensional space assuming pure hubble flow .",
    "the 275 mpc radius , roughly the abell radius , serves to smooth the small - scale galaxy distribution , although the counts in the spheres are still subject to some shot - noise .",
    "this size of sphere is smaller , but roughly comparable to the gaussian smoothing length of 5@xmath158  mpc used by @xcite to smooth the cfa2 galaxies around 3c  273 , where their simulations demonstrate their density contours are not sensitive to smoothing lengths varied between 2@xmath158  to 10@xmath158   mpc .",
    "artificial absorbers were randomly generated according to a poisson distribution with a mean equal to the mean number of @xmath0  lines found along the path length : 1.1 absorber per los .",
    "we found constant @xmath112   at these low redshifts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy density distribution at the random absorber positions was then determined in the same way , and this was repeated for 50 trials .",
    "we then compared the distributions of galaxy density with both a ks test and a @xmath159  test . the advantage of these tests that they assume no _ a priori _ model for galaxy - absorber correlation , and so are sensitive to a wider range of scenarios .",
    "the distributions of galaxy density can be seen in figure , where the distributions for real and simulated absorbers ( for all 50 trials ) are plotted together , each individually normalized to the total number of absorbers .",
    "figure suggests that the real absorbers seem to correspond to typically higher galaxy densities than the randomly distributed absorbers .",
    "a ks test between the two density distributions yields only a 12% chance the distributions are the same .",
    "however , the reduced @xmath159  is 1.04 , implying the distributions are a good match , but with only a 59% certainty .",
    "although statistically well - motivated , this test can not distinguish between the case where the absorbers trace the galaxy density and where the absorbers are independent of the galaxies .",
    "we tried two different methods to associate absorbers with individual galaxies .",
    "the first method matched galaxy - absorber pairs by finding the nearest galaxy three - dimensionally that was of any luminosity down to our completeness level , assuming pure hubble flow ( referred to as the @xmath160  method ) .",
    "the second method allowed for a velocity window around the absorber to account for the uncertainty in mapping radial velocity into distance , and took the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter that fell within that velocity range , @xmath161 , around the absorber ( referred to as the @xmath162 method ) .",
    "if no galaxy was found within @xmath161 , the matching galaxy was then chosen as the galaxy with the smallest three - dimensional distance , @xmath160  ( although , this was not necessary for any of the 11 observed absorbers in this redshift range ) .",
    "the velocity window @xmath161  =  300  was chosen to allow for cosmic virial scatter and for small - scale peculiar motions , being the approximate velocity dispersion of a poor group of galaxies . with this value of @xmath161",
    ", an absorber counterpart was found for each of the 11 absorbers from @xmath163  .",
    "other groups have chosen a wide range of methods for associating absorbers with galaxies .",
    "variants of the @xmath162  method seem to be the most popular .",
    "this is probably due to the velocity - space uncertainties mentioned above , to the inherent velocity errors when working at high redshift , and to the fact that no assumption is required beyond some degree of symmetry of the absorbing object .",
    "we report the results of both tests .",
    "the @xmath161 chosen by various groups varies enormously .",
    "@xcite considered each absorber more individually , generally considering a galaxy `` associated '' for @xmath164  400 .",
    "le brun et al .",
    "( 1996 ) adopted a higher value of @xmath165  750 , claiming this falls between galaxy rotation and internal velocity dispersions of 100200  and emission - line region velocity variations of up to 900 .",
    "@xcite initially favored @xmath166 , but that group now relies upon @xmath167  and @xmath168  parameters from their galaxy - absorber cross - correlation function , and only consider galaxy - absorber pairs with @xmath164  500 , and @xmath16975 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath165  300 , similar to @xcite , since it encompasses the velocity dispersions of massive galaxy halos , and since dispersions in this region roughly correspond to poor group dispersions of 300 . with the exception of the virgo cluster itself ( @xmath170 ) ,",
    "the volume contains no coma - cluster - like dispersions of @xmath171 .    for each of the two methods ,",
    "the absorbers were paired to the virgo galaxy sample ( as defined in  5.1 ) , but the limiting luminosity of the sample was varied to simulate survey selection effects .",
    "surface brightness selection effects , which could also affect galaxy - absorber pairing , were neglected ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "first , absorbers were matched to the closest @xmath151  galaxy , then matched to the closest @xmath172  galaxy , and lastly matched to the closest @xmath173  galaxy .",
    "the results of these three pairings are listed in tables a and b for the @xmath160  and @xmath162  methods , respectively .",
    "the wavelength , velocity and rest equivalent width of the absorbers for each line of sight are listed with the three - dimensional distance to the partner galaxy in kpc , the impact parameter of the galaxy to the los in kpc , the galaxy name , position and velocity , and the absolute magnitude ( calculated according to a distance from pure hubble flow ) , recessional velocity in , and velocity reference code .",
    "velocity reference codes are described in table c. the pairings using the two methods were not unique , and in fact multiple absorbers along the same line of sight chose the same galaxy as the closest match . for the @xmath174  sample ,",
    "7/11 pairs were different between the two methods , for @xmath172 , 5/11 were different , and for @xmath173 , 7/11 .",
    "in addition , for the @xmath162  method , each luminosity cut had 2 absorbers in one los with the same galaxy as a match .",
    "this degeneracy of pairing demonstrates the inherent difficulties in choosing a single method for pairing up an absorber with an individual galaxy .",
    "it also suggests that there may be no unique and physically reasonable way to identify a galaxy responsible for any particular absorption line .",
    "the impact parameters for the galaxy - absorber pairs can be compared to the impact parameters for galaxy - absorber pairs found in the same way for randomly - distributed , artificial absorbers .",
    "the artificial absorber redshifts were generated by the same method as the previous ks test , consistent with a poisson distribution with a mean of 1.1 absorbers per los , then matched with real galaxies in the virgo sample according to both the @xmath160  method and the @xmath162  method .",
    "for each pairing method , a ks test was performed , comparing the distribution of impact parameters for the real galaxy - absorber pairs and the artificial pairs .",
    "this was repeated for 50 trials of artificial absorbers for each method , and the @xmath175 values were again averaged over those trials , and the probability that the distributions are the same , @xmath176 , was calculated .",
    "this test was repeated for the two extremes of the luminosity cuts in tables a and b , @xmath174  and @xmath177 .    in figure , the distributions of impact parameter for real and simulated absorbers are plotted together , where the simulated absorbers are presented for the sum of 50 trials , normalized to the total number of absorbers . panels a and b show the @xmath174  pairs for the two methods , and panels c and d show the @xmath173  pairs . in the upper panels ,",
    "the differences between the two pairing methods can be seen in the fact that the @xmath162  method is slightly skewed towards smaller @xmath168  than the @xmath160  method , due to the fact that the @xmath160  method chooses the closest galaxy in three - dimensions , which is not necessarily the galaxy with the smallest impact parameter .",
    "however , both methods produce similar results for this test . while in both methods",
    "the real and random distributions appear to be very similar , the real absorbers in both cases tend towards smaller impact parameters and do not have the same high @xmath168  tail as in the random distributions . this can be seen in the resultant ks probabilities where for the @xmath160  method , there is a 36% probability the real and random distributions are the same , and for the @xmath162method we find a 27% probability . in the lower panels ,",
    "it is clear that limiting the analysis to only the most luminous galaxies introduces significant noise .",
    "the ks probabilities bear out the visual impression that the impact parameter distributions are both close to being random , with probabilities of 73% and 60% for the @xmath160  and the @xmath162methods , respectively .",
    "the severity of the duplicity of galaxy - absorber pairings , plus the tendency towards a random distribution of impact parameters for more luminous galaxies highlights the potential severity of survey selection effects , especially with the high - redshift galaxy work .",
    "we then did the complementary experiment of looking for galaxies that fall close to the line of sight but do not produce absorption within the detection limit . to do this , we selected bright galaxies ( @xmath178 or greater ) that fell within @xmath179  50075 kpc of a quasar los , and then searched for an absorber within @xmath180  300  of the galaxy velocity . to ensure complete velocity coverage for this search , the galaxy pathlength searched",
    "was shortened to @xmath181 .",
    "if no absorber is found , we can assign an upper limit to the equivalent width of the possible absorption line using the 3@xmath77  limiting equivalent width at that wavelength in the spectrum .",
    "of the five @xmath182  galaxies falling within @xmath152  50075 kpc of the 10 lines of sight , only one of them matched an absorber within 300 , suggesting a covering factor for @xmath178 of @xmath183% .",
    "for fainter galaxies , @xcite found a covering factor of 50% for @xmath184  for @xmath18575  kpc , and they suggest that for fainter samples it should increase to 100% . for a more direct comparison , we consider galaxies in the virgo sample with @xmath18575  kpc and use @xmath161   = 500 which limits the search pathlength further to @xmath186 . with these new constraints ,",
    "we find 3/8 @xmath184  galaxies to have matching absorbers , giving a similar covering factor of 60% . however , for fainter galaxies , we find that only 4/18 @xmath187galaxies have a matching absorber , yielding a decrease in the covering factor to 22% . despite the small number statistics , we find a number of luminous galaxies in the virgo region that do not cause absorption , even when close enough to be considered a `` physical pair '' .",
    "one of the strongest pieces of evidence to associate absorbers with individual luminous galaxies is claimed to be the observed anticorrelation between rest equivalent width and impact parameter ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in figure , we plot impact parameter , @xmath168 , of the galaxy vs. rest equivalent width , @xmath188 , of the absorber .",
    "the top two panels ( a & b ) show the absorbers when matched to galaxies @xmath174 , for the two methods , @xmath160  and @xmath162 , respectively , and the lower two panels ( c & d ) show the same for pairs matched to @xmath172   galaxies .",
    "our identified absorbers are indicated by triangles , and the bright galaxies ( @xmath189 ) with no detected absorption within @xmath190 are shown as upper limits in equivalent width . the anticorrelation relationship from @xcite",
    "is also plotted as the solid line , and with that group s `` physical pair '' limit of @xmath19175  kpc designated by the dashed line .",
    "we note that for both pairing methods , the upper panels which include fainter galaxy counterparts appear consistent with the anticorrelation line , whereas the lower panels of brighter galaxies are not .",
    "this is interesting because the galaxies originally used to fit the function , from @xcite , only extend to @xmath192 ( with 3/35 exceptions , 2 of which are at the lowest redshifts ) .",
    "if our sample is similarly limited to @xmath172 , as can be seen in figures c and d , for a given @xmath188 line , we identify absorbers with galaxies at impact parameters much larger than the anticorrelation of @xcite would predict .    removing the magnitude restrictions ,",
    "our absorbers are invariably identified with fainter galaxies at smaller impact parameters for both pairing methods ( seen in figures a and b ) . to some degree , this can be expected for randomly distributed absorbers , which in all of our earlier random trials chose galaxies in the more luminous galaxy sample at typically larger impact parameters than in the fainter sample . however , it is difficult to disentangle such random effects from the real physical association of the absorbers and galaxies .",
    "@xcite define a model where the absorption is caused by an extended gaseous halo around the galaxy , and so a `` physical pair '' is an galaxy - absorber pair for which the galaxy - absorber cross - correlation function is greater than 1 , and @xmath18575  kpc ( @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the @xmath188@xmath168  anticorrelation naturally arises for @xmath185  kpc , and an absorber associated with a galaxy at @xmath193  75  kpc is caused by an undetected galaxy at smaller impact parameter that is correlated with the detected galaxy . in panels a and b of figure , 2/11 and 7/11 of our absorbers fall within @xmath194   27075 kpc , respectively , although some of these galaxies still fall at impact parameters too large for such low luminosity galaxies .",
    "the remaining pairs fall above this limit , which according to @xcite means these galaxies are correlated with undetected ( i.e. lower luminosity ) galaxies at smaller impact parameter .",
    "if this physical picture is correct , then roughly one - third to half of our absorbers are caused by galaxies somehow overlooked in our sample or by galaxies falling below @xmath195 .",
    "combining data from the literature on the @xmath188@xmath168anticorrelation in    figure , we see that all data sets mostly find galaxy - absorber pairs at the highest impact parameters , with the exception of @xcite which only find pairs for @xmath196   27075 kpc , by construction . here",
    "again we plot log @xmath188  vs. @xmath168 with the solid line indicating the @xcite best - fit and the large triangles are the data from the @xmath197  method from this paper .",
    "the open triangles are the galaxy - absorber pairs when matching only to @xmath172  galaxies , the filled triangles are the pairs when matching to @xmath174   galaxies , and the dotted line connects the galaxy data points for the same absorber .",
    "the other data included are from the literature , with filled symbols indicating galaxies with @xmath198  and open symbols galaxies with @xmath199 .    at high @xmath168 , there is no measurable anticorrelation between @xmath188and @xmath168 . at high @xmath168 ,",
    "it is easy to select a bright galaxy counterpart when there is in fact a fainter counterpart at smaller @xmath168 , as observed for about half of our absorbers .",
    "however , of all the @xmath200 points plotted , 8/11 from this paper , 4/5 from @xcite , 5/5 from @xcite , and 0/3 from @xcite fall at @xmath20175 kpc , which is too large to be caused by an extended halo of such low luminosity galaxies . with",
    "the @xcite points removed , figure would resemble more of a scatter plot . as pointed out by @xcite",
    ", there are a number of @xmath202 absorbers from @xcite sample with no counterpart galaxies , which could be associated with galaxies beyond their search radius .",
    "if those absorbers fall at large @xmath168 , the anticorrelation would be further weakened .",
    "another feature of figure is upward trend of the @xmath20375 kpc ( @xmath204  kpc ) points , while the @xmath20575 kpc points show no real trend with @xmath188 .",
    "this division has been suggested as an equivalent width effect ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , with weaker lines arising from a different physical process .",
    "however , the division in figure does not correspond to any hard equivalent width cutoff , but could correspond to the @xmath188,@xmath168  position of a predominant transition in gas phase as calculated from simulation ( @xcite ; see the next section of the paper . )    in framing our data in the context of the current literature , we have discovered significant problems with uniquely assigning an individual galaxy as associated with an absorber . in comparing two pairing methods ( @xmath160  and @xmath162 ) , which produce very different galaxy - absorber pairings , we find there is no way to statistically distinguish between the two methods as to which",
    "is a better prescription .",
    "furthermore , each method is also very sensitive to magnitude completeness , since for three different absolute magnitude limits , we could almost always find a fainter galaxy at smaller impact parameters ( an effect predicted by @xcite ) .",
    "this is of particular concern for high redshift   work , since the largest and brightest galaxies tell a different story than going further down the luminosity function .",
    "moreover , these selection effects in luminosity do not address further ambiguities due to surface brightness selection effects ( c.f .",
    "our @xmath206% covering factor for @xmath200  galaxies is consistent with previous estimates , but , contrary to some predictions , yields smaller covering factors for fainter limits .",
    "this is contrary to expectations ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) that by going to faint enough magnitudes , every absorber can be reasonably associated with a galaxy . limiting our data to galaxy - absorber pairs of limiting magnitude similar to those in the literature ( @xmath200 ) ,",
    "our data show no anticorrelation between @xmath188  and @xmath168 .",
    "extending that limit to intrinsically fainter galaxies does induce a @xmath188@xmath168correlation , but these fainter galaxies have correspondingly smaller halo sizes .",
    "nothing in our data would specifically lead us to associate absorbers preferentially with luminous galaxies on halo size scales .",
    "the observation of low column density hydrogen absorbers has emerged as a powerful cosmological tool .",
    "insights from theory and hydrodynamic simulations give the basic picture : the  forest at high redshift is the main repository of baryons in the universe and it is a relatively unbiased tracer of the underlying dark matter distribution ( rauch 1998 ) .",
    "diffuse and highly ionized hydrogen forms a `` cosmic web '' of large scale structure ( bond & wadsley 1998 ) . as the universe expands and evolves , much of the gas is heated and shocked or collapses into galaxies and larger structures .",
    "the number density of absorbers declines toward low redshift , and they can only be studied from space . however ,",
    "at low redshift it is possible to make direct comparisons with the galaxy distribution .",
    "we have studied  absorption along ten sightlines in the direction of the virgo cluster .",
    "the resulting sample of 139 lines above a detection limit of 3@xmath77 is the largest yet studied in the local universe ( @xmath34 ) . at the resolution of the ghrs observations ( 200 ) , essentially all of the absorption lines are unresolved .",
    "the number density of lines above a rest equivalent width of 0.24  , @xmath7 , agrees well with the the measurement from the quasar absorption line key project ( weymann et al .",
    "there is marginal evidence for cosmic variance in the number of absorbers detected among the ten sightlines .",
    "down to a limit of 0.1  , the line statistics are consistent with the study of two sightlines by tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and with an extrapolation of the relationship for @xmath207 fitted to the key project data .",
    "the upturn in line density to @xmath208 above 0.020   observed by shull ( 1997 ) must set in at column densities below 10@xmath4 @xmath6 .",
    "we looked for clustering among the  absorbers by carefully modelling the varying sensitivity and redshift pathlength of the ten different sightlines .",
    "resolution and potential blending effects prohibit a search for clustering on velocity scales less than 250 .",
    "we detect an excess of nearest neighbor line pairs on velocity scales of 250 - 750  at a 95 - 98% confidence level .",
    "there is no significant excess on larger scales that might correspond to the velocity dispersion of a rich cluster .",
    "the hypothesis that the absorbers are randomly distributed in velocity space can be ruled out at the 99.8% confidence level .",
    "no two - point correlation power is detected ( @xmath8 with 95% confidence ) , in marginal disagreement with tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . we do not have the resolution or line statistics to look for the small scale clustering signal predicted by cen et al .",
    "we find  absorbers to be less clustered than bright galaxies , in accord with grogin & geller ( 1998 ) .",
    "absorber - absorber correlation amplitude on scales of 250 - 500  is 45 times smaller than galaxy - galaxy correlation amplitude .",
    "a detailed comparison between absorbers and nearby galaxies produces results that are difficult to interpret .",
    "we restrict the comparison to the eleven  lines in the radial velocity range 9003000 . over the contiguous volume threaded by the ten sightlines , the galaxy sample is complete to @xmath9 .",
    "absorbers lie preferentially in regions of intermediate galaxy density .",
    "it is not possible to uniquely assign a galaxy counterpart to each absorber , even if it is assumed that galaxies are surrounded by spherical halos that can cause absorption ( clwb ) .",
    "ambiguities arise due to the uncertain mapping of redshift into distance and due to the large number of low luminosity galaxies for every luminous galaxy .",
    "we find multiple or non - unique absorber counterparts in 7/11 cases .",
    "the complete galaxy sampling allows us to do the converse experiment  to look for absorbers at small impact parameters from luminous galaxies . a halo covering factor to  absorption of 20%",
    "is deduced for galaxies of @xmath209 and impact parameters @xmath210 kpc . for somewhat fainter galaxies , @xmath211 , with @xmath212 kpc , the covering factor is 60% . in general , there is no behavior in this sample that specifically implicates luminous galaxy halos in causing the absorption .",
    "some insight into the physical state of the absorbers at low redshift comes from a comparison with the recent hydrodynamic simulations of dav et al .",
    "( 1998 ; see also reidiger et al .",
    "1988 ; theuns et al . 1998 ) .",
    "they found that the dynamical state of an absorber  expanding or collapsing , shocked or unshocked  depends mainly on the overdensity of the gas , @xmath213 .",
    "with decreasing redshift and universal expansion , a given column density selects absorbers which are increasingly overdense and which have progressively more advanced dynamical states .",
    "figure 14@xmath123 shows the rest equivalent width distribution of our sample of absorbers . in figure 14@xmath74",
    ", the column density is estimated from rest equivalent width using a curve of growth and assuming a doppler parameter of @xmath214 .",
    "the vertical dashed line marks the column density below which the metal abundance of the absorbers falls sharply ( lu et al .",
    "we can use the relation between gas overdensity and column density from the simulations ( in a @xmath215-dominated cdm model ) to estimate the overdensity of our absorbers , as shown in figure 14c ( the conversion is relatively insensitive to the assumed doppler parameter ) .",
    "the association of overdensity with the phase of the gas  diffuse igm , shocked igm , or condensed  is crude , because we have no estimate of the temperature of the gas and an increasing fraction of the moderate overdensity gas is shocked at decreasing redshift .",
    "because only the weakest lines in the sample have equivalent widths and overdensities that correspond to overdensities of a few , we infer that we are not in general probing the diffuse igm . tracing the evolution of the most diffuse structures from redshifts 3 , 2 , 1 and 0 means examining absorbers with column densities of @xmath216 , 13.8 , 13.2 and 12.7 , respectively . for @xmath217",
    "this corresponds to rest equivalent widths of about 0.39 , 0.21 , 0.075 , and 0.026  .",
    "possibly the sharp rise in @xmath207 seen by shull ( 1997 ) below 10@xmath4 @xmath6 represents this intergalactic population .",
    "most of the absorbers in the virgo sample have overdensities ranging from a few up to @xmath218 and have not yet collapsed into galaxies .",
    "figure 15 revisits the distribution of equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter for our data ( circled ) and other studies in the literature .",
    "the approximate regions of the three absorbing gas phases are superimposed ( dav et al . 1998 ) .",
    "an anticorrelation between @xmath188 and @xmath168 is anticipated because of the way gas traces the underlying mass distribution of large - scale structure .",
    "the strongest absorbers arise from the denser gas near galaxies , the majority of absorbers with 3075 @xmath219  27075 kpc arise from shock - heated gas near galaxies , and absorbers with @xmath220  27075 kpc are associated with a cooler , diffuse gas component",
    ". we can not be sure that the segregation of observations to the upper regions of this plot is physically meaningful , since we have found ambiguities in the assignation of absorber counterparts , and some absorbers identified with luminous galaxies at large impact parameters might just as well be identified with lower luminosity galaxies at smaller impact parameters .",
    "the galaxy counterparts to our limited sub - sample of absorbers with radial velocities of 9003000  are all at @xmath22175 kpc , too far to be bound to a halo potential .",
    "our detection of weak clustering of the absorbers is consistent with gas that loosely traces large scale structure .",
    "this study , and all others to this point , have been limited by the meager statistics of absorbers at low redshift .",
    "future observations will allow us to increase the number of sightlines and revisit the issue of clustering .",
    "it will be very interesting to study the relation between clustering amplitude and gas overdensity",
    ". it may even be possible to identify a set of local absorbers at low column density that are primeval and completely unrelated to the space distribution of bright galaxies .",
