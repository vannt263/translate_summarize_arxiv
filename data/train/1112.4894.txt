    "motivated by the theoretical problems in the standard model ( sm ) , many extended models beyond the sm have been established . among them the large extra dimensions ( led ) model proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali in ref.@xcite may be one of the promising models which can solve the long - standing mass hierarchy problem .",
    "this model used the idea of extra dimensions to bring gravity effects from the plank scale down to the electroweak scale . in the led model ,",
    "the spacetime dimension is @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the dimension of extra space , where the gravity and gauge interactions are unified at one fundamental scale @xmath6 ( the order of the electroweak scale ) .",
    "the graviton propagates in the @xmath7-dimensional spacetime , while the sm particles exist only in the usual ( @xmath8)-dimensions .    taking into account of the bad behavior of quantum gravity in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region ,",
    "it is expedient to construct a low - energy effective theory to describe the gravity - gauge - matter system in the current ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime . in the phenomenological sense",
    ", this can be achieved through the kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction in the brane - world scenario @xcite . after applying this treatment to the led model",
    ", a @xmath7-dimensional massless graviton can be perceived as a tower of massive kk modes propagating in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "it turns out that the weakness of gravitational coupling to the sm particles , suppressed by @xmath9 ( the reduced planck scale @xmath10 ) , can be compensated by summing over numerous kk states .",
    "this scenario can result in distinct effects at the high - energy colliders @xcite .",
    "up to now , many studies on the virtual kk graviton effects up to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the led model have emerged .",
    "these include the processes of fermion - pair , multijet , and vector - boson - pair production @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "the cms collaboration has performed a search for led in the diphoton final state events at the @xmath11 lhc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath12 .",
    "they set lower limits on the cutoff scale @xmath13 in the range @xmath14 at the @xmath15 confidence level .",
    "the dijet angular distribution results from the cms and atlas experiments appeared in ref.@xcite and provide even stronger limits on @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath16 ( cms ) and @xmath17 ( atlas ) .",
    "recently , the production of a @xmath0-pair at hadronic colliders in the led model has been studied up to the qcd nlo by neelima agarwal , _ et al _ @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath0-pair production process at the lhc in the framework of the led model , and improve upon the results of ref.@xcite by including the effects of top - quark mass and the contribution from the @xmath18-fusion channel .",
    "we provide the led effect discovery and exclusion regions , the kinematical distributions up to nlo in qcd by taking into account the subsequential @xmath0-boson leptonic decay .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly go into the related feynman rules in the led model . in sec .",
    "iii , the leading - order(lo ) cross section for the @xmath19 process is described . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the nlo qcd corrections . in sec .",
    "v , we present the numerical results for the lo and nlo qcd corrected integrated cross section for the @xmath0-pair production process and the distributions of final @xmath0-boson decay products .",
    "finally , a short summary is given .",
    "the led model consists of the pure gravity sector and the sm sector . in this model",
    "the manifold , in which gravity propagates , is not the ordinary four - dimensional spacetime manifold @xmath20 , but @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a compact manifold of dimension @xmath5 . for simplicity",
    ", one can tentatively assume that @xmath22 is a @xmath5-torus with radius @xmath23 and volume @xmath24 without loss of physical significance .    in our work",

    "there inevitably exist the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences in the nlo calculations , and we adopt the dimensional regularization scheme in @xmath116 dimensions to isolate and manipulate these divergences .",
    "a. virtual corrections    the feynman diagrams for the virtual corrections to the @xmath117and @xmath118partonic processes are shown in fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] , respectively . in figs.[fig4](3 ) and .[fig4](4 ) the diagrams involving yukawa coupling between higgs boson and top quarks are included , but the diagrams involving yukawa coupling between higgs boson and massless quarks are excluded due to their vanishing contribution .",
    "there exist uv and soft / collinear ir singularities in the calculations of these one - loop diagrams . to remove the uv divergences ,",
    "we need only the wave function renormalization constants for the quark and gluon fields .",
    "we introduce the renormalization constants @xmath119 for massless quark ( q = u , d , c , s , b ) fields and @xmath120 for the gluon field defined as @xmath121 in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath122 ) renormalization scheme the renormalization constants for the massless quarks are expressed as @xmath123 to remove the uv and ir divergences in the @xmath124-fusion subprocess , we need introduce the counterterms for the top - quark field and its mass , i.e. , @xmath125 we use the on - mass - shell scheme to renormalize the top - quark field and mass .",

    "moreover , @xmath139 and @xmath140 refer to the uv and ir divergences , respectively .            then the results for the differential cross sections for the @xmath141 annihilation and @xmath142 fusion partonic channels are uv finite but soft / collinear ir divergent .",
    "the soft / collinear ir singularities can be canceled by adding the contributions of the real emission partonic processes and the corresponding pdf counterterms .",

    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig6 ] , respectively .",
    "we employ the two cutoff phase space slicing ( tcpss ) method @xcite to calculate the contributions from the real gluon emission partonic processes .",
    "an arbitrary soft cutoff @xmath145 is introduced to separate the gluon emission subprocess phase space into two regions , soft gluon and hard gluon regions .",
    "furthermore , another cutoff @xmath146 is introduced to decompose the real hard gluon emission phase space region into hard collinear ( @xmath147 ) and hard noncollinear ( @xmath148 ) regions .",
    "the partonic differential cross section for the real gluon emission subprocess can be expressed as @xmath149            c. real light-(anti)quark emission    in addition to the real gluon emission discussed above , there are contributions from the massless light-(anti)quark ( @xmath150,@xmath151 ) emission partonic processes . in the five - flavor scheme the massless light - quark @xmath152 involves @xmath132- , @xmath133- , @xmath134- , @xmath135- , @xmath137-quarks .",
    "considering the fact that the final ( anti)bottom - quark can be tagged in experiments and the collinear ir singularities of the real ( anti)bottom - quark emission subprocesses are completely canceled by those of the corresponding pdf counter terms , we do not include the contributions of the bottom and antibottom emissions , and adopt the five - flavor pdfs @xcite .",
    "we depict the feynman diagrams for the partonic processes @xmath153 and @xmath154 in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "these partonic processes contain only the initial state collinear singularities . by using the tcpss method described above , we can split the phase space into collinear and noncollinear regions .",
    "the differential cross sections for the partonic processes @xmath155 and @xmath156 can then be expressed as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are finite and can be evaluated by using the general monte carlo method .",
    "d. nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath19 process    combining the renormalized virtual corrections and the real gluon / light-(anti)quark emission contributions , the partonic cross sections still contain the collinear divergence , which can be absorbed into the redefinition of the pdfs at the nlo according to the mass factorization @xcite .",
    "we find that after the summation of all the nlo qcd corrections , the soft and collinear ir divergences vanish .",
    "we can see from above discussion that the final total @xmath160 corrections consist of the two - body term @xmath161 and the three - body term @xmath162 .",
    "the total cross section up to the qcd nlo is expressed as @xmath163 it is uv finite , ir safe , and cutoff @xmath164 independent @xcite , which will further be checked in the numerical evaluations .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results of the integrated cross sections and the kinematic distributions of the final particles for the @xmath19 process in both the sm and led model up to the qcd nlo . in order to verify the correctness of our numerical calculations ,",
    "we made the following checks :    * in table [ tab1 ] , we list our numerical results of the lo and nlo qcd corrected integrated cross sections in the sm for the @xmath19 process by taking the input parameters , pdfs , and event selection criterion from table 4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it shows that our lo and nlo qcd corrected cross sections in the sm are in good agreement with those in ref.@xcite within the integration errors .",

    "we calculate the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath166 process in the sm and led model at the lhc .",
    "we investigate the integrated cross sections , the distributions of some kinematic variables and how they are affected by radiative corrections .",
    "the calculations are compared with previous works , and finally the reliable numerical results are obtained .",
    "we find that the nlo qcd corrected results do not show remarkable reduction of the scale uncertainties of the lo cross sections in both the sm and led model , because the uncertainty of the lo cross section is underestimated .",
    "the scale - dependent @xmath167-factor is found to be the value from @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) to @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) when @xmath172 goes from @xmath173 to @xmath174 at the @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) lhc , with the constraints of @xmath177 and our jet event selection criterion . the @xmath178 discovery and @xmath179 exclusion ranges for the led parameters @xmath180 are also obtained in the nlo qcd .",
