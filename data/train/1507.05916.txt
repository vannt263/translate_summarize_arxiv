    "two transits of hd 189733b were obtained on the two half nights of june 3 and july 4 , 2013 using hires on keck i @xcite .",
    "the approximate resolving power of the observations is @xmath8@xmath168,000 , or 4.4 km s@xmath9 at h@xmath0 .",

    "the observations from june 3 begin at first contact and so add no significance to the pre - transit detection .",
    "in addition , the cadence of the june observations was twice as long , due to intermittent terrestrial clouds and haze , providing less detail on the shape of the transit . for these reasons we do not include the june data in the analysis .",

    "telluric absorption is removed from the h@xmath0 spectra using the telluric fitting program molecfit @xcite .",
    "we first remove the strong h@xmath0 line absorption from a telluric standard .",
    "the telluric absorption in the standard is then fit using molecfit .",
    "the best telluric fit is then shifted appropriately in wavelength , scaled , and subtracted from each individual observation .",

    "telluric removal is not performed for these lines .",
    "the transmission spectrum is defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a single observation and @xmath14 is the master post - transit spectrum . in order to obtain the final transmission spectra all observations must be normalized and aligned in wavelength space .",
    "changes in spectral resolution due to temperature or instrument flexure are minimal and do not affect the spectra over the course of one half night .",
    "all spectra are initially normalized using a 4th order polynomial . a single out - of - transit spectrum is then chosen as the comparison spectrum in order to apply a wavelength correction to all spectra . a number of stellar absorption lines in each spectrum are cross correlated with the same lines in the comparison spectrum .",
    "we tested three different types of fits to the resulting wavelength shifts : constant , linear , and spline fits .",
    "the spline and linear fits perform no better , and in some cases worse , than a constant offset in wavelength .",
    "thus the constant offsets are used to rectify the wavelength vectors for each spectrum relative to the comparison spectrum .",
    "this results in precisely aligned spectra where the largest residuals occur across 12 pixels at the cores of narrow spectral lines .",
    "cores of identified stellar absorption lines in the normalized spectra are ignored when calculating the absorbed flux in each line so these residuals do not contribute to the transmission signal .",
    "once spectra have been normalized and wavelength shifted they are divided by the master out - of - transit spectrum , a co - addition of the selected out - of - transit spectra .",
    "the resulting spectrum is renormalized to remove slowly varying continuum shapes leftover from the division .",

    "values of @xmath15 do not change by more than 25% , for any measurement , if the integration width is extended to @xmath18500 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the in  transit emc distributions are generated by randomly selecting 5000 subsets of in - transit spectra and comparing them to either the master out - of - transit spectrum ( the in - out method ) or the master in - transit spectrum ( the in - in method ) .",
    "the standard deviations of the resulting distributions are taken to be the 1@xmath19 uncertainties for the reported in - transit absorption .",
    "each line is clearly detected at @xmath203@xmath19 .",
    "we note that propagated poisson errors result in very similar estimates ( @xmath120% less than the emc estimates ) for the absorption uncertainties in each line .",
    "we choose to use the uncertainty derived from the emc due to its ability to highlight systematic errors , which can dominate the measurement if not taken into account .",
    "the small number of pre  transit observations ( @xmath21=4 ) does not allow sufficient combinations of spectra to be generated for the emc process described above .",
    "instead , we compare the average pre  transit spectrum to all possible combinations of the nine post  transit spectra ( @xmath21=511 ) . the standard deviation of the resulting distribution , shown in the fifth column of , is taken as the 1@xmath19 uncertainty for the measured absorption .",
    "this process is also used to estimate an average uncertainty for the individual points in .    as an additional test of the emc procedure and to verify that we are actually measuring absorption in the balmer lines , we perform the same in  transit emc analysis for three control lines of ca i. one line is chosen each for h@xmath0 , h@xmath6 , and h@xmath7 from the same spectral order that the balmer line is located in .",
    "ca i is expected to condense out of the atmospheres of hot jupiter exoplanets and thus should not exist in atomic form in large quantities @xcite . if systematics from the reduction procedure are resulting in absorption in the balmer lines we are likely to see similar artifacts in the ca i control lines .",
    "the results of the control line transmission and emc analyses are shown in .",

    "the absorption that we measure is @xmath150% lower than that from @xcite .",

    "the h@xmath7 signal is detected slightly below the 3@xmath19 level .",
    "the pre - transit absorption exhibits a few important properties .",
    "first , the ratio of the absorbed flux between h@xmath0 and h@xmath6 is @xmath25 , which is much lower than in the optically thin limit .",
    "this indicates that the absorbing material is optically thick .",
    "indeed , the line morphologies of the pre - transit observations appear saturated , i.e. , flat bottomed and broad . secondly , the absorption abruptly begins to decrease between @xmath26 and @xmath27 minutes .",
    "this requires that the material causing the pre - transit absorption must begin to exit the stellar disk before the time of first optical contact ( labeled @xmath28 in ) .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of absorbing material is asymmetric with respect to the planet , a point that is supported by the lack of any significant absorption seen at similar times post - transit ( in contrast to gj 436 , for example ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the integrated absorption never exceeds @xmath11.3% which requires that the optically thick absorbing material cover a similar fraction of the stellar surface .",
    "star spot crossings are not unusual for hd 189733b @xcite .",
    "the transit of a star spot or active region can change the relative amount of stellar light being absorbed by the occulting material .",
    "the transit of a spot - free chord can also change the relative amount of stellar light being absorbed , even for specific spectral features , if there is a non - negligible fraction of the stellar surface covered by spots @xcite .",
    "stellar activity can also mimic transit features when comparing spectra from different times : if the star brightens or dims relative to the time of comparison , this signal can appear as the absorption of stellar flux when in truth it is merely variation in the amount emitted by the star . for our case , stellar variability due to time - dependent balmer line emission from active regions can mimic the spectral line absorption :",
    "if the star is more active during the times when the out - of - transit spectra are measured , the filling in of the stellar balmer line cores will appear as an absorption signature for any spectrum measured at a time when the star is less bright .",
    "there is ample evidence that the absorption signatures we measure are not caused by stellar variability . both pre- and in - transit spectra",
    "are compared to the same out - of - transit spectra .",
    "this requires that any absorption signal caused purely by stellar variability have the same absorption strength in both the pre- and in - transit spectra .",
    "this is clearly not the case .",
    "in fact , the pre - transit measurements are significantly stronger than the in - transit measurements despite the fact that the exosphere , by way of the occulting planet , transits an effectively smaller stellar disk than the bow shock",
    ". if the pre - transit absorption is entirely due to stellar variability , the in - transit absorption would necessarily be _ stronger _ than the pre - transit absorption .",
    "since this relationship is not seen in the data , the absorption can not be solely due to stellar balmer line variability .",
    "this means that the pre - transit signal must be caused by absorbing material occulting the stellar disk .",
    "an indicator of stellar activity level is the @xmath29-index measured from the ca ii h and k lines @xcite .",
    "the index , shown in for the july transit , has similar values pre - transit compared to post - transit , although there appears to be a decrease about halfway through the transit .",
    "the similar @xmath29-index values both before and after transit also indicate that the pre - transit absorption is not caused by variable stellar emission .",
    "the strength of spectral features can be affected by the relative contributions of the stellar photosphere and spots or active regions @xcite . while the transiting bow shock , which is transparent to continuum photons , is not subject to this affect ,",
    "the opaque transiting planet certainly is .",
    "if the planet transits a spot - free chord , the stellar spectrum will be weighted towards the spot spectrum and the relative strength of spectral features between in and out - of - transit observations can change , even at the @xmath30 level . as a result ,",
    "this effect is capable of producing spurious in - transit features .",
    "we do not believe this to be the case for our in - transit absorption measurements . in general , spotted active regions will fill in the balmer line cores with emission , causing the line strength to effectively decrease .",
    "when the planet is transiting , this produces weaker absorption lines since the observed spectrum is weighted towards the active spotted regions . when compared to out - of - transit measurements , this will produce in - transit _ emission _ features .",
    "the fact that we see the opposite , i.e. , strong in - transit absorption features , indicates that we are measuring absorption through the atmosphere of the planet .",
    "however , the absolute strength of the measured absorption is almost certainly affected .",
    "the contribution of spotted active regions most likely causes us to underestimate the strength of the in - transit exospheric absorption . this may be the cause of the difference between the in - transit absorption strength measured here and that of @xcite , who measure the in - transit line depth to be two times deeper .",
    "the arguments given above apply to the general features of the absorption time series .",
    "it is difficult , however , to determine how individual absorption measurements are affected by a nonuniform stellar disk .",
    "some absorption measurements may well be affected by spots or bright regions on the stellar surface .",
    "for example , in between 3rd and 4th contact the absorption varies between the expected values from the exiting exosphere and much stronger absorption not accounted for by the model",
    ". these points could be due to the transitory occultation by the exosphere of bright chromospheric regions on the limb of the star .",
    "modeling of these variable features is beyond the scope of this study but they provide a plausible explanation for the departure of individual points from the model estimates .",
    "we model the pre  transit absorption as arising in a thin bow shock orbiting ahead hd 189733 b. the in  transit absorption is modeled as arising in the exosphere of the planet .",
    "we neglect limb darkening in our model calculations since we are measuring the absorption across a very narrow ( @xmath11.0  ) portion of the stellar line .",
    "this portion of the balmer lines forms in a very thin layer in the stellar atmosphere with a small temperature gradient and thus suffers negligibly from limb darkening @xcite .",
    "we construct a simple model of the pre - transit absorption as arising in a bow shock orbiting ahead of the planet . while a bow shock is not the only possible cause of the absorption , it is a plausible one and has been successful at explaining the pre - transit uv observations of wasp12-b and hd 189733b @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to model the full physical conditions of the stellar wind / corona and the resulting bow shock conditions . instead , we assume a bow shock geometry and require that the @xmath31 hydrogen density assigned to the bow shock produce the necessary absorption .",
    "we assume that the standoff distance of the magnetosphere , @xmath32 , is equal to the distance of the nose of the shock from the planet .",
    "the bow shock model is constructed using the shock geometry of @xcite .",
    "a density is assigned to the nose of the shock and then scaled along the bow according to the scaling law    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the linear distance from the planet to the bow shock and @xmath0 is the exponent describing how quickly the density changes with distance from the density at the nose , @xmath35 .",
    "the distance @xmath34 is always greater than @xmath32 so the density decreases monotonically from the nose .",
    "a 3d density grid is then filled according to the prescription of the density law with the chosen value of @xmath0 .",
    "the bow shock is rotated around the z  axis with angle @xmath36 from the tangent to the planet s orbital motion .",
    "the column density of the material covering the stellar disk is then calculated .",
    "the cell size in the grid is 0.01 @xmath2 , the same size as the shock thickness .",
    "we find that a cell size of this magnitude is required in order to reproduce the relatively small absorption values from the data .",
    "larger cells , which necessarily result in a larger shock width , result in too much of the stellar disk being covered by optically thick material .",
    "we find values of @xmath15 to within @xmath15% of the reported values if we decrease the grid cell size to 0.005 @xmath2 , indicating that the shock thickness of 0.01 @xmath2 is not an artifact of the resolution .",

    "we use the optical depth as a function of velocity from line center to approximate an absorption line profile for each grid point using the column density calculated from the 3d bow shock .",

    "we point out that the model seems to poorly reproduce the pre - transit h@xmath7 line profile and absorption values .",
    "we believe this is due to the blending of h@xmath7 with a nearby fe i line which causes the red wavelength side of the h@xmath7 profile to show weaker absorption .",

    "for example , setting @xmath59 results in too large of a projected area of the bow shock and requires the density to become even more highly concentrated at the nose . similarly , smaller values of @xmath0 do not concentrate the material enough at the nose and the absorption values are too large .",

    "the excited hydrogen density we find from our model is thus representative of the physical state of the gas at the nose of the shock .",

    "this likely indicates that the exosphere does not follow a simple hydrostatic pressure law and a more realistic treatment is necessary to more closely match the line ratios .",
    "we note that the exospheric parameters derived here and very similar to those derived by @xcite who give a detailed treatment of the @xmath31 hydrogen level population in the exosphere of hd 189733b .",
    "our measurements can be used to estimate the planetary magnetic field strength by considering some limiting cases of pressure balance between the interplanetary material ( i.e. , stellar wind or corona ) and the planetary magnetosphere . rewriting equation ( 9 ) from @xcite",
    "we see that the magnetic field strength of the planet at the pole is    @xmath81^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath82 is the mass density of the stellar wind or corona , @xmath83 is the relative velocity of the planet and the wind , @xmath84 is the thermal pressure of the wind , and @xmath85 is the interplanetary magnetic field strength ( i.e. , the stellar magnetic field strength at the orbital radius of the planet ) .",
    "all of the pressure terms are the values at the orbital radius of the planet .",
    "equation 4 neglects any pressure from the planetary atmosphere or wind .",
    "the equatorial magnetic field strength , assuming the field is purely dipolar , is one - half the polar value .",
    "we adopt our favored model parameters and assume that the bow shock is mediated by a magnetosphere .",
    "if we neglect the pressure due to the stellar magnetic field , the dipolar magnetic field strength of the planet can be estimated by assuming pressure balance between the stellar wind and the planetary magnetosphere @xcite . by neglecting the stellar magnetic pressure",
    "we are essentially estimating a lower limit for the field since any addition to the pressure will require a larger planetary field strength for the inferred standoff distance . we choose a stellar wind temperature of @xmath86 k",
    "which is roughly consistent with a wind of velocity of @xmath87100 km s@xmath9 at 0.03 au @xcite .",
    "the wind is assumed to be traveling radially at 40 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the azimuthal wind velocity is neglected .",
    "the stellar wind is taken to be an ideal gas composed purely of protons to provide an estimate for @xmath84 .",
    "we also assume that the material in the shock has been compressed by a factor of 4 , i.e. , the shock is adiabatic , resulting in a stellar wind density of @xmath82=2.5@xmath6310@xmath51 g @xmath52 .",
    "we note that this density is very similar to the stellar wind density derived by @xcite ( @xmath13@xmath6310@xmath51 g @xmath52 ) to reproduce observed l@xmath0 absorption in hd 189733b .",
    "given these assumptions we estimate an equatorial magnetic field strength of @xmath88 g for hd 189733b , similar to the upper limit of 24 g derived by @xcite for wasp12-b .",
    "the estimated field strength is @xmath17 times larger than jupiter s equatorial field ( @xmath14 g ) and is driven by the large value of @xmath32 .",
    "the scaling relation of @xcite is used by @xcite to estimate the magnetic field strength of hd 189733b at @xmath114 g. the factor of two difference between our estimates and those from the scaling relation indicate a factor of @xmath18 difference in the internal heat flux used in the scaling relation estimate .",
    "the additional heat source suggested by our estimates could have significant implications for models of hot jupiter interiors .",
    "while we have focused on a planetary bow shock as the mechanism for producing the pre - transit absorption , alternate scenarios exist for producing similar signals .",
    "the effects of charge exchange between a hot stellar wind and a planetary wind are investigated in @xcite .",
    "their model , which has a similar geometry to the bow shock approximation , produces a layer of hot , dense neutral hydrogen at a similar standoff distance ( @xmath110 @xmath2 ) as found in our model and shows decent agreement with lyman @xmath0 absorption measurements .",
    "their model likely predicts too large of an excited hydrogen density over too large a volume to match the low absorption values found here .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation of excited hydrogen absorption in this context would be informative .",
    "indeed , charge exchange may be occurring in the bow shock between stellar wind protons and neutral hydrogen that has escaped from the planet , contributing to the @xmath89=2 hydrogen density .",
    "transiting accretion streams from the planet , which is overflowing its roche lobe , to the star can produce sufficient column density and coverage of the stellar disk to result in pre - transit absorption @xcite .",
    "this scenario , however , should produce red - shifted absorption which is not observed in our data .",
    "in fact , we find no absorption centroids shifted by more than @xmath185 km s@xmath9 from line center .",
    "this suggests that the excited hydrogen has a symmetric bulk velocity along the line of sight .",
    "we have presented our detection of resolved pre - transit line absorption around hd 189733b in the first three members of the hydrogen balmer series .",
    "a bow shock model is able to reproduce the important features of the absorption time series .",
    "the physical parameters derived from our model suggest an equatorial planetary magnetic field strength of @xmath88 g. this large value is driven mainly by the large standoff distance of the magnetosphere @xmath60 @xmath2 , a parameter that is well constrained by the model . for the derived standoff distance ,",
    "this field strength is likely a lower limit due to the multiple simplifying assumptions employed in the estimate .",
    "more detailed models which include the stellar magnetic field pressure and a full treatment of the stellar wind will prove insightful . the expected variability of the bow shock signal can also be tested by observing multiple transits across many epochs .",
    "observations of this type could be useful probes of stellar wind variability for hj hosts .",
    "the magnetic field of a hj plays an important role in determining the planetary mass loss rate : the stronger the magnetic field , the lower the outflow rate @xcite .",
    "planetary magnetic fields also provide a potential source of energy for spis via reconnection events with the stellar corona @xcite .",
    "this energy flux scales as @xmath90 @xcite so larger magnetic field strengths can potentially induce more energetic spis .",
    "if the field strengths estimated above are common for hj exoplanets , this regime needs to be more fully explored by mass loss and spi models which have generally considered field strengths similar to or less than that of jupiter @xcite .",
    "planetary magnetospheres are a revealing diagnostic of planetary interiors and the first line of defense against energetic stellar wind particles which can have a devastating impact on planetary atmospheres and life near the surface of the planet . while considered to be a critical property in understanding a planet , its evolution , and habitability , the prospects of measuring an exoplanetary magnetic field were thought to be remote .",
    "however , if independent measurements can be made of the planet hosts stellar wind , observations such as those presented here may provide important constraints on exoplanetary magnetic fields .",
    "the large field strength we estimate implies that lower magnetic field strengths , as found in our solar system , may not be ubiquitous among other exoplanet systems .",
    "a population study of magnetic field properties of exoplanets that display bow shock - like structures will complement measurements of solar system magnetospheres and be used to better understand planetary interiors and the intertwined relationship of magnetic fields , planetary atmospheres , and habitability .",
