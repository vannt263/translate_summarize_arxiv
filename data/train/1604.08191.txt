    "elections are a general and widely used framework for preference aggregation in human and artificial intelligence applications .",
    "an important negative result from social choice theory , the gibbard - satterthwaite theorem  @xcite , states that every reasonable election system is manipulable .",
    "however , even though every election system is manipulable , it may be computationally infeasible to determine how to manipulate the outcome .",
    "bartholdi , tovey , and trick   introduced the computational study of the manipulation problem and this began an exciting line of research that explores the computational complexity of different manipulative attacks on elections ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of single - peaked preferences introduced by black   is the most important restriction on preferences from political science and economics and is naturally an important case to consider computationally .",
    "single - peakedness models the preferences of a collection of voters with respect to a given axis ( a total ordering of the candidates ) .",
    "each voter in a single - peaked election has a single most - preferred candidate ( peak ) on the axis and the farther candidates are to the left / right from her peak the less preferred they are .",
    "single - plateauedness extends this to model when each voter has multiple most - preferred candidates that appear sequentially on the axis , but are otherwise single - peaked  @xcite .",
    "this standard model of single - peaked preferences has many desirable social - choice properties . when the voters in an election are single - peaked , the majority relation is transitive  @xcite and there exist voting rules that are strategy - proof  @xcite ( i.e. , a voter can not misrepresent her preferences to achieve a personally better outcome ) .",
    "single - peakedness for total orders can also have an effect on the complexity of many different election attack problems when compared to the general case .",
    "the complexity of manipulative attacks often decreases when the voters in an election are single - peaked  @xcite , and the winner problems for kemeny , dodgson , and young elections are in p  when they are @xmath0-complete in general  @xcite .",
    "most of the abovementioned research on the computational complexity of manipulation of elections , both for the general case and for single - peaked electorates , has been limited to the assumption that voters have tie - free votes . in many real - world scenarios",
    "voters have votes with ties , and this is seen in the online repository preflib  @xcite that contains several different preference datasets that contain ties .",
    "there are also election systems defined for votes with ties , e.g. , the kemeny rule and the schulze rule  @xcite .",
    "recent work considers the complexity of manipulation for top - order votes ( votes where all of the ties are between candidates ranked last )  @xcite .",
    "fitzsimmons and hemaspaandra   considered the complexity of manipulation , control , and bribery for more general votes with ties , and also the case of manipulation for a nonstandard model of single - peakedness for top - order votes .",
    "menon and larson   later examined the complexity of manipulation and bribery for an equivalent ( for top orders ) model of single - peakedness .",
    "fitzsimmons and hemaspaandra   use the model of possibly single - peaked preferences from lackner   where a preference profile of votes with ties is said to be single - peaked with respect to an axis if the votes can be extended to tie - free votes that are single - peaked with respect to the same axis . menon and larson   use a similar model for top orders that they state is essentially the model of single - peaked preferences with outside options  @xcite . both fitzsimmons and hemaspaandra   and menon and larson",
    "find that these notions of single - peakedness exhibit anomalous computational behavior where the complexity of manipulation can increase when compared with the case of single - peaked total orders .",
    "we are the first to study the computational complexity of manipulation for the standard model of single - peaked preferences for votes with ties , and for single - plateaued preferences for votes with ties .",
    "in contrast to the recent related work using other models of single - peakedness with ties , we find that the complexity of weighted manipulation for @xmath1-candidate scoring rules and for @xmath1-candidate copeland@xmath2 elections for all @xmath3 does not increase when compared to the cases of single - peaked total orders , and that the complexity of weighted manipulation does not increase with respect to the general case of elimination veto elections .",
    "we also compare the social choice properties of these different models , and state a surprising result on the relation between the societal axis and the complexity of manipulation for single - peaked preferences .",
    "an _ election _ consists of a finite set of candidates @xmath4 and a finite collection of voters @xmath5 .",
    "we will sometimes refer to this collection of voters as a _ preference profile_. an _ election system _ @xmath6  is a mapping from an election to a set of winners , which can be any subset of the candidate set ( the nonunique winner model , our standard model ) , or at most a single candidate ( the unique winner model ) .",
    "each voter in an election has a corresponding vote ( or _ preference order _ ) over the set of candidates .",
    "this is often assumed to be a _ total order _ ,",
    "i.e. , a strict ordering of the candidates from most to least preferred .",
    "formally , a total order is a complete , reflexive , transitive , and antisymmetric binary relation .",
    "we use `` @xmath7 '' to denote strict preference between two candidates .    similarly , a _ weak order _ is a total order without antisymmetry , so each voter can rank candidates as tied ( which we will sometimes refer to as indifference ) as long as their ties are transitive .",
    "we use `` @xmath8 '' to denote a tie between two candidates .",
    "a _ bottom order _ is a weak order where all ties are between top - ranked candidates and a _ top order _ is a weak order where all ties are between bottom - ranked candidates .",
    "notice that a total order is a weak order , a top order , and a bottom order , that a top order is a weak order , and that a bottom order is a weak order .",
    "throughout this paper we will sometimes refer to weak orders as votes with ties .",
    "for some of our results we consider weighted elections , where each voter has an associated positive integral weight and a voter with weight @xmath9 counts as @xmath9 unweighted voters all voting the same .",
    "our election systems include scoring rules , elimination veto , and copeland@xmath2 .",
    "we define each below and the extensions we use to properly consider votes with ties .",
    "given an election with @xmath1 candidates , a scoring rule assigns scores to the candidates using its corresponding @xmath1-candidate scoring vector of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and each @xmath12 .",
    "so , when the preferences of a voter are a total order , the candidate ranked in position @xmath13 receives a score of @xmath14 from that voter .",

    "we use the definitions of scoring - rule extensions for weak orders from our previous work  @xcite , which generalize the extensions introduced for top orders from baumeister et al .   and from narodytska and walsh   which in turn generalizes the extensions used by emerson   for borda .",
    "given a weak - order vote , we can write it as @xmath19 , where each @xmath20 is a set of tied candidates , ( so in the case of a total order vote each @xmath20 is a singleton ) . for each @xmath20 ,",

    "the veto scoring rule is used , the candidate with the lowest score is eliminated , and the rule is repeated on the remaining votes restricted to the remaining candidates until there is one candidate left  @xcite .",
    "we break ties lexicographically , and for comparison with related work our results for elimination veto use the unique winner model , and for votes with ties we use the min extension .",

    "we consider four important models of single - peaked preferences for votes with ties . for the following definitions , for a given axis @xmath65 ( a total ordering of the candidates ) and a given preference order @xmath66",
    ", we say that @xmath66 is strictly increasing ( decreasing ) along a segment of @xmath65 if each candidate is preferred to the candidate on its left ( right ) with respect to @xmath65 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ex - peak ] we present an example of each of the four models of single - peaked preferences , and in figure  [ fig : relation ] we show how the four models relate to each other .",

    "[ def : standard ] given a preference profile @xmath5 of weak orders over a set of candidates @xmath4 , @xmath5 is single - peaked with respect to a total ordering of the candidates @xmath65 ( an axis ) if for each voter @xmath67 , @xmath65 can be split into three segments @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( @xmath68 and @xmath70 can each be empty ) such that @xmath69 contains only the most preferred candidate of @xmath66 , @xmath66 is strictly increasing along @xmath68 and @xmath66 is strictly decreasing along @xmath70 .",
    "observe that for a preference profile of votes with ties to be single - peaked with respect to an axis , each voter can have a tie between at most two candidates at each position in her preference order since the candidates must each appear on separate sides of her peak .",
    "otherwise the preference order would not be _ strictly _ increasing / decreasing along the given axis .",
    "the model of single - plateaued preferences extends single - peakedness by allowing voters to have multiple most preferred candidates ( an indifference plateau )  @xcite .",
    "this is defined by extending definition  [ def : standard ] so that @xmath69 can contain multiple candidates .",
    "lackner   recently introduced another extension to single - peaked preferences , which we refer to as `` possibly single - peaked preferences '' throughout this paper .",
    "a preference profile is possibly single - peaked with respect to a given axis if there exists an extension of each preference order to a total order such that the new preference profile of total orders is single - peaked .",
    "this can be stated without referring to extensions , for votes with ties , in the following way .",
    "given a preference profile @xmath5 of weak orders over a set of candidates @xmath4 , @xmath5 is possibly single - peaked with respect to a total ordering of the candidates @xmath65 ( an axis ) if for each voter @xmath67 , @xmath65 can be split into three segments @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( @xmath68 and @xmath70 can each be empty ) such that @xmath69 contains the most preferred candidates of @xmath66 , @xmath66 is weakly increasing along @xmath68 and @xmath66 is weakly decreasing along @xmath70 .",
    "notice that the above definition extends single - plateauedness to allow for multiple indifference plateaus on either side of the peak .",
    "so for votes with ties , possibly single - peaked preferences model when voters have weakly increasing and then weakly decreasing or only weakly increasing / decreasing preferences along an axis .",
    "another generalization of single - peaked preferences for votes with ties was introduced by cantala  : the model of single - peaked preferences with outside options .",
    "when preferences satisfy this restriction with respect to a given axis , each voter has a segment of the axis where they have single - peaked preferences and candidates appearing outside of this segment on the axis are strictly less preferred and the voter is tied between them . similar to how single - plateaued preferences extend the standard single - peaked model to allow voters to state multiple most preferred candidates , single - peaked preferences with outside options extends the standard model to allow voters to state multiple least preferred candidates .    given a preference profile @xmath5 of weak orders over a set of candidates @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 is single - peaked with outside options with respect to a total ordering of the candidates @xmath65 ( an axis ) if for each voter @xmath67 , @xmath65 can be split into five segments @xmath71 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath72 ( @xmath71 , @xmath68 , @xmath70 , and @xmath72 can each be empty ) such that @xmath69 contains only the most preferred candidate of @xmath66 , @xmath66 is strictly increasing along @xmath68 and @xmath66 is strictly decreasing along @xmath70 , for all candidates @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath66 states @xmath49 , and for all candidates @xmath75 , @xmath66 states @xmath76 .",
    "menon and larson   state that the model of single - peakedness for top orders that they use is similar to single - peaked preferences with outside options .",
    "it is clear from their paper that for top orders these models are the same .",
    "so for the remainder of the paper we will refer to the model used by menon and larson   as `` single - peaked preferences with outside options for top orders . ''",
    ", the solid line is the single - peaked order @xmath77 , the dashed line is the single - plateaued order @xmath78 , the dashed - dotted line is the single - peaked with outside options order @xmath79 , and the dotted line is the possibly single - peaked order @xmath80 . see figure  [ fig : relation ] for the relationships between the four models . ]",
    "we now state some general observations on single - peaked preferences with ties , including how the models relate to each other , as well as their social - choice properties .",
    "it is easy to see that for total - order preferences each of the four models of single - peakedness with ties that we consider are equivalent . in figure",
    "[ fig : relation ] we show how each model relates for weak orders , top orders , and bottom orders .    given a preference profile of votes",
    "it is natural to ask how to determine if an axis exists such that the profile satisfies one of the above restrictions .",
    "this is referred to as the consistency problem for a restriction .",
    "bartholdi and trick   showed that single - peaked consistency for total orders can be determined in polynomial time ( i.e. , is in p ) , and fitzsimmons   extended this result to show that single - peaked , single - plateaued , and possibly single - peaked consistency for weak orders is in p. this leaves the consistency problem for single - peaked preferences with outside options , which we will now show to be in p.    it is easy to see that given a preference profile of top orders , it is single - peaked with outside options if and only if it is possibly single - peaked .",
    "so it is immediate from the result by lackner   that shows that possibly single - peaked consistency for top orders is in p , that the consistency problem for single - peaked preferences with outside options for top orders is in p. for weak orders the construction used to show that single - peaked consistency for weak orders is in p   by fitzsimmons   can be adapted to hold for the case of single - peaked preferences with outside options for weak orders , so this consistency problem is also in p.    given a preference profile @xmath5 of weak orders it can be determined in polynomial time if there exists an axis @xmath65 such that @xmath5 is single - peaked with outside options with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "one of the most well - known and desirable properties of an election with single - peaked preferences is that there exists a transitive majority relation  @xcite .",
    "a majority relation is transitive if for all distinct candidates @xmath81 if @xmath49 and @xmath82 by majority then @xmath83 by majority .",
    "when the majority relation is transitive then candidates that beat - or - tie every other candidate by majority exist and they are denoted the weak condorcet winners .",
    "this also holds when the voters have single - plateaued preferences  @xcite .",
    "it is not the case that the majority relation is transitive when preferences in an election are single - peaked with outside options or are possibly single - peaked .",
    "fitzsimmons   points out that for possibly single - peakedness this was implicitly shown in an entry of table  9.1 in fishburn  , where a preference profile of top orders that violates single - peaked preferences was described that does not have a transitive majority relation , and this profile is possibly single - peaked ( and single - peaked with outside options ) .",
    "cantala also provides an example of a profile that is single - peaked with outside options that does not have a weak condorcet winner , and so does not have a transitive majority relation  @xcite .",
    "for total - order preferences , weighted manipulation for any fixed number of candidates is known to be np  for every scoring rule that is not isomorphic to plurality or triviality  @xcite . for single - peaked total orders ,",
    "faliszewski et al .   completely characterized the complexity of weighted manipulation for 3-candidate scoring rules and this result was generalized by brandt et al .   for any fixed number of candidates . these results both showed that the complexity of weighted manipulation for scoring rules often decreases when voters have single - peaked total orders .    for top - order preferences , dichotomy theorems for 3-candidate weighted manipulation for scoring rules using round down , min , and average",
    "were shown by menon and larson for the general case  @xcite and for the case of single - peaked preferences with outside options for top orders  @xcite .",
    "menon and larson   found that , counterintuitively , the complexity of weighted manipulation for single - peaked preferences with outside options often increases when moving from total orders to top orders .",
    "we also mention that for the scoring - rule extension max , we earlier found that the complexity of 3-candidate weighted manipulation for borda increases for possibly single - peaked preferences when moving from total orders to top orders  @xcite .",
    "we show that for the standard model of single - peakedness and for single - plateauedness that the complexity of weighted manipulation for @xmath1-candidate scoring rules using max , min , round down , and average does not increase when moving from total orders to top orders , bottom orders , or weak orders .",
    "the following results are close analogs to the case for single - peaked total orders due to brandt et al .  .",
    "[ lem : sp - first ] if @xmath57 can be made a winner by a manipulation of top - order , bottom - order , or weak - order votes that are single - peaked , single - plateaued , possibly single - peaked , or single - peaked with outside options for a scoring rule using max , min , round down , or average , then @xmath57 can be made a winner by a manipulation ( of the same type ) in which all manipulators rank @xmath57 uniquely first .",
    "suppose that a manipulator has a vote of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a weak order over @xmath62 ( where @xmath62 can be empty ) , @xmath86 , each of @xmath87 are nonempty groups of tied candidates , and @xmath88 .",

    "case 2 : : :    otherwise , we let @xmath93 be the candidates to the left of    @xmath62 and @xmath94 be the candidates to the right    of @xmath62 with respect to the axis . without loss of    generality",
    "let @xmath95 .",
    "we can then change the vote of    the manipulator to    @xmath96 .",
    "notice that in all of the above cases , for all candidates @xmath97 that @xmath98 does not decrease , regardless of which scoring - rule extension is used .",
    "so if @xmath57 is a winner with the initial vote , @xmath57 is still a winner in the vote that ranks @xmath57 uniquely first .",

    "so , let the societal axis be @xmath100 .",
    "we first consider the p  cases for single - peaked total orders described in lemma  6.6 of brandt et al .",
    "where for all @xmath101 such that @xmath102 it holds that @xmath103 .",
    "the crucial observation in the proof of this lemma is that for every set of single - peaked total order votes @xmath54 , we are in one of the following two cases :    1 .   for all @xmath13 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath13 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .    we will show that this is also the case for single - peaked and single - plateaued orders with ties .",

    "the most surprising result in the work by menon and larson   was that the complexity of 3-candidate cwcm for elimination veto for single - peaked preferences with outside options for top orders using min is np - complete , whereas for single - peaked total orders  @xcite and even for total orders in the general case  @xcite it is in p.    @xcite @xmath1-candidate elimination veto cwcm for total orders is in p  in the unique - winner model .",

    "( though menon and larson do qualify that the conjecture from faliszewski et al .",
    "concerned total orders . )",
    "however , for the standard model of single - peaked preferences and for single - plateaued preferences , elimination veto cwcm for top orders , bottom orders , and weak orders using min is in p  for any fixed number of candidates , thus the counterexample crucially relies on using a nonstandard definition .",
    "@xmath1-candidate elimination veto cwcm for single - peaked and for single - plateaued top orders , bottom orders , and weak orders using min is in p  in the unique - winner model .",
    "the proof of this theorem follows from a similar argument to the proof of the theorem for single - peaked total orders from menon and larson  .",
    "this is because that proof follows from the fact that for total orders the candidate eliminated after each round is on the leftmost or rightmost location of the axis , and the reverse of an elimination order is single - peaked with respect to the axis .",
    "it is easy to see that both of these statements also hold for single - peaked votes with ties , since the only candidates that can be vetoed in each round are still the leftmost and rightmost candidates on the axis .",
    "for single - plateaued preferences it is possible for voters with an indifference plateaued to veto more than two candidates ( after all of the candidates ranked below their indifference plateau have been eliminated ) , but it is easy to see that these votes do not affect which candidate is eliminated since all of the remaining candidates are vetoed by such voters .",
    "it is also clear that lemma  12 from coleman and teague  @xcite still holds which states that if there exists a collection of votes that can induce an elimination order , then this elimination order can be induced by all of the manipulators voting the reverse of the elimination order .",
    "so since we know that the reverse of an elimination order is single - peaked with respect to the axis , and that there are only polynomially many possible elimination orders with @xmath57 first , the manipulators simply try each elimination order with @xmath57 first .",
    "since the elimination order is always a total order , the above argument clearly holds for single - peaked and single - plateaued top orders , bottom orders , and weak orders .",
    "it is known that 3-candidate copeland@xmath2 cwcm for all rational @xmath144 is np - complete for total orders in the nonunique - winner model  @xcite , and when @xmath145 ( also known as llull ) cwcm is in p  for @xmath146  @xcite and the cases for @xmath147 remain open .",
