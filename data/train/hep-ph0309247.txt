    "the qcd lattice calculations support the idea that the confining potential energy in a three quark system can be , at best , simulated by the so - called y - shape potential @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the three pointlike quarks ( located at the apices of a triangle @xmath0 ) , are connected by three flux tubes starting from a junction point ( @xmath1 ) in such a manner that it minimizes the sum of the distances to the three quark positions .",
    "note that effective qcd theories support also this idea @xcite .",
    "if the angle corresponding to an apex is greater than 120@xmath2 , the junction point is precisely at this apex , whereas if all the angles are less than 120@xmath2 , then the equilibrium junction position coincides with the so - called toricelli ( or fermat or steiner ) point ; it corresponds to a point for which the corresponding angles @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are all equal to 120@xmath2 .",
    "thus the genuine string potential in a baryon is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the string tension , in principle a constant of the theory .",
    "this expression has been used in several works ( see for instance refs .",
    "the success of simple quark models using a potential to simulate the confinement without gluonic modes can be justified by the fact the lowest gluonic excitation energy in the three quark system is found to be about 1  gev in the hadronic scale @xcite .",
    "efficient methods to deal with y - shape interaction relies either on monte - carlo algorithms ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) or hyperspherical methods ( see for instance ref .",
    "however it is very difficult to implement in a numerical code , essentially for two reasons : i ) it is a three - body operator which makes the equations very complicated ; ii ) the presence of two different expressions depending upon the configuration makes the integration domain not evident to handle .",
    "this complexity explains why , for practical calculations , the genuine y - shape potential is often replaced by other expressions that are considered as approximants .",
    "the most popular one is to consider half the perimeter of the triangle formed by the three quark coordinates and to define the confining potential as @xmath8 which is also called the @xmath9-shape potential .",
    "however it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the three quark potential energy is better represented by the y - shape interaction than by the @xmath9-shape one . nevertheless , potential ( [ vc ] ) is a two - body operator , free from the complication due to angles ; hence it is much more simple and it is still widely used in practice ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a @xmath10 colour dependence associated with a two - body linear confinement does produce such a 1/2 factor .",
    "although this colour prescription is perfectly relevant in the case of one - gluon exchange , there is no theoretical justification to apply it for the confinement potential .",
    "this 1/2 factor is close to the value 0.53 , predicted by lattice calculation @xcite , if one tries to replace the y - shape by a @xmath9-shape .",
    "it is very important to stress that both the genuine string potential ( [ vy ] ) and the two - body confining potential ( [ vc ] ) are of geometrical essence , depending only on the position of the quarks and independent of their masses .",
    "another approximation , that was suggested , is to replace the true junction point @xmath1 by the centre of mass @xmath11 of the three quark system @xcite . in this case",
    "the corresponding confining operator is simply @xmath12 this approximation is particularly interesting since this potential is a one - body operator free from angle complications ; hence its numerical treatment is quite easy .",
    "in contrast to the previous expressions , this approximation does depend on the system via the centre of mass coordinate .    in this paper , assuming that @xmath13 represents the true physics , we want to study the quality of the approximations ( [ vc ] ) , ( [ vg])and their relevance .",
    "to this end , we propose two approaches : a geometrical one and a dynamical one relying on the hypercentral formalism . with this last technique ,",
    "it is possible to obtain directly an average value of the confining potential energy depending only on one lenght parameter .",
    "then we check their validity with an exact three - body treatment based on a complete hyperspherical treatment ( beyond the hypercentral approximation ) .",
    "a simulation of three - body potential by sums of two - body potentials was performed in ref .",

    "conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "we are interested in the ratio of the potential energy for two forms of confining interactions as function of the configuration of the system .",
    "since this ratio is scale independent and since the dynamical constant @xmath14 disappears in this ratio , it is always possible to rescale the quark triangle putting @xmath15 = 1 and to deal only with the remaining apex of the triangle . denoting by @xmath16 the minimal distance from the junction point @xmath1 , by @xmath17 the distance from the centre of mass @xmath11 , and by @xmath18 half the perimeter of the triangle , we will study the ratios : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    in order to obtain analytical expressions ( already complicated ! ) for these ratios we restrict ourselves to a system with 2 identical quarks of mass @xmath22 located in @xmath23 and @xmath24 and a third one of mass @xmath25 located in @xmath26 .",

    "in fact this study is still too complicated .",
    "one can simplify it a lot noting that there is a symmetry versus the mediating line of @xmath15 , with the consequence that @xmath36 .",
    "this implies that an extremum of those ratios , the only important thing for our consideration , always lies in the mediating line and it is sufficient to restrict the study to isosceles triangles .",
    "thus , we only compute @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    in a quantum mechanical treatment of the confinement ,",
    "the wave function of course explores all the configurations for the triangle so that , may be , the most important physical quantity to be computed is the average of the previous ratios .",

    "this ratio is always larger than 1 , meaning that the genuine string junction potential is always more repulsive than the sum of the two - body confining potentials .",
    "however the ratio is 1 for a flat triangle or for an infinitely stretched triangle , and presents a maximum , @xmath44 , for an equilateral triangle .",

    "it is very instructive to emphasize that for a large domain of masse ratios @xmath76 , the error introduced by replacing the toricelli point by the centre of mass is less than 10% .",

    "( [ by ] ) , while for centre of mass junction and half perimeter confinement one must employ @xmath214 and @xmath213 of formulas ( [ bg ] ) and ( [ bc ] ) respectively .",
    "the numerical results of the various possibilities are of course different although they should be close , within less than 10% .",
    "this property was the conclusion of our two previous sections .    at the light of the behaviour of the curves @xmath80 and",
    "@xmath216 , it is natural to try to simulate the potential @xmath13 by defining a new confining potential @xmath228 with @xmath229 and @xmath230 given respectively by formulas  ( [ vc ] ) and ( [ vg ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize that the unique above definition agrees with both the geometrical approach for the ratio @xmath231 and the hyperspherical approach using @xmath215 .",
    "as the ratios @xmath80 and @xmath216 are very close to 1 , one can hope that the @xmath232 and the @xmath13 will give similar spectra with the same string tension .",
    "the situation is not so favourable for potentials @xmath229 and @xmath230 since the corresponding ratios @xmath100 and @xmath233 can differ from 1 by more than 10% .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to simulate results obtained from the y - shape potential by using a renormalized value of the string tension in potentials @xmath229 and @xmath230 .    indeed ,",
    "let us suppose that we perform an hyperspherical calculation for @xmath1 approximation with a string constant @xmath234 .",
    "now let us perform an hyperspherical calculation for @xmath235 approximation not with an identical string constant @xmath236 , but with a string constant modified in the following way @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "obviously , one recovers the original equation and thus the original results .",
    "in other words , one can simulate the results of a treatment based on an approximation @xmath1 , by performing a treatment based on an approximation @xmath235 , provided we change the string constant in a consistent way .",
    "this conclusion is perfectly exact for the hypercentral approximation .",
    "this does not mean that it must remain exact if we perform a more sophisticated three - body treatment .",
    "the quality of this simulation , as well as the results coming from @xmath232 , are the subjects of this section .    our numerical algorithm to solve the three - body problem with potentials @xmath229 , @xmath230 and @xmath232 is based on an expansion of the wave function in terms of harmonic oscillator functions with different sizes @xcite .",
    "it was checked with other methods and was proved to give results of good accuracy if the expansion is pushed sufficiently far ( let say up to 16 - 20 quanta ) .",
    "moreover it can deal easily with a relativistic kinetic energy operator .",
    "the detail of technical aspects is not the subject of this paper and can be found elsewhere @xcite . for the present purpose ,",
    "it is enough to say that we are able to solve in a very fast and precise way a three - body calculation either with a non - relativistic or relativistic expression for the kinetic energy operator .",
    "one - body and two - body operators are easy to implement , but three - body operators are much more complicated to handle , specially if one must distinguish several integration domains , as it is the case for the y - shape potential . in this paper , the three - body problem with potentials @xmath13 is solved by the hyperspherical method without the limitation of the hypercentral approximation @xcite . at the present stage , only s - wave states can be computed with good accuracy .",
    "this is why the simulation of a three - body operator either with a two - body , a one - body operator , or a mixing of both is important .",
    "we consider a system composed of 3 quarks of type @xmath239 ( for @xmath240 or @xmath241 ) , @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath139 . in this paper , we are only interested in the possibility to simulate the genuine confinement by simpler potentials and , for that purpose , it is enough to restrict the interaction to the confining term only .",
    "forgetting about coulomb , hyperfine and constant potentials , our results can not be compared to physical systems .",
    "but the comparison of the various simulations between themselves are very instructive .",
    "but just to have some connections with the real systems , we put arbitrarily the masses of the quarks at the physical values ( in gev ) @xcite : @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 .",
    "the only potential taken into account is the linear confining potential as defined in the first section . to see the sensitivity of the results versus the kinematics",
    ", we perform two types of calculation : one based on a non - relativistic expression ( schrdinger equation ) , and one based on a relativistic expression ( spinless salpeter equation ) . to test also the sensitivity to excited states",
    ", we performed the calculations not only for ground states ( @xmath248 and @xmath249 ) , but also for the first radial excited state ( @xmath248 and @xmath250 ) , and when it is possible the first orbital excited state ( @xmath251 and @xmath249 ) .",
    "this section does not deal with the y shape potential , but nevertheless it is important because we compare here two treatments that we are able to handle easily , in any physical situation , and with a good accuracy .",
    "the possibility to simulate one treatment by the other is very instructive and can be tested carefully , so that firm conclusions can be drawn .    for a number of systems , exploring a large domain of the @xmath81 parameter , we calculate first the baryon binding energies obtained with the centre of mass junction ( @xmath11 approximation ) and with the half perimeter confinement ( @xmath26 approximation ) using the same value of the string tension @xmath252 gev@xmath253 .",
    "this value is close to the accepted value coming from lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "then we keep this value of @xmath7 , do the calculations for the @xmath11 approximation using a modified value of the string tension based on the arguments of the geometrical approach @xmath254 and on the arguments of the hyperspherical approach @xmath255= @xmath256 , and compare with the @xmath26 calculation with the string tension at the value @xmath7 .",
    "we also perform the reciprocal calculations .",
    "our quantitative results are presented in table  [ tab1 ] for a nonrelativistic kinematics .",
    "note that the definition of the ratio @xmath257 ( see sec .",
    "[ compst ] ) implies that @xmath258 .",
    "this property is not exact for the ratio @xmath259 .",
    "however , the value @xmath260 ( coming from formula  ( [ rcy ] ) ) must be compared with @xmath261 ( formula  ( [ pe ] ) ) .",
    "these values are very close and this gives us confidence to use @xmath262 for all cases .",
    "if we compare column ( 1 ) and column ( 4 ) from table  [ tab1 ] , we can see that , with the same string tension , masses obtained by potentials @xmath229 or @xmath230 are rather different .",
    "the binding energy can differ by about 200 mev or more .",
    "so it is relevant to answer the question :  is it possible to simulate each potential by the other , simply in adjusting the value of the string tension ? \" .",
    "if we look at columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for systems characterized by @xmath31 , we can see that all masses are identical ( actually , they differ at the 6th digit , which is at the limit of the accuracy of our calculation method ) .",
    "it is then possible to simulate perfectly the potential @xmath229 with a string tension @xmath7 by the potential @xmath230 with the string tension @xmath263 .",
    "this property , which is exact at the hypercentral approximation , is also verified for the full calculation for symmetrical systems .",
    "the situation is less favourable for systems with @xmath264 . in these cases",
    ", we can remark that the masses of column ( 2 ) are always greater than the masses of column ( 1 ) . for @xmath265 and @xmath266 baryons ,",
    "the agreement is good , especially for the ground state .",
    "but for very asymmetrical systems such as @xmath267 and @xmath268 baryons , there can exist greater mass differences , up to about 100 mev .",
    "let us remark that , for the ground state , the agreement is still reasonable ( better than 2% ) .",
    "if we compare now data from columns ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , we can see that , in general , the potential @xmath229 is not so well simulated by the potential @xmath230 using @xmath269 instead of @xmath270 .",
    "in particular , masses from these two columns are not identical for systems with @xmath31 ( since an exact simulation is impossible with the geometrical approach , we consider that using @xmath271 instead of @xmath272 in column ( 6 ) do not spoil our conclusions ) . in most cases , masses of columns ( 3 )",
    "are greater than masses of column ( 2 ) .",
    "but for very asymmetrical systems , a peculiar mass in column ( 3 ) can be closer to the one in column ( 1 ) than the corresponding mass in column ( 2 ) .",
    "we retrieve the same features in comparing data from columns ( 4 ) with data from columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "but one can remark that the masses of column ( 5 ) are always smaller of the masses of column ( 4 ) , when they are not identical .",
    "moreover the masses of column ( 6 ) are generally smaller than those of column ( 5 ) .",
    "this situation is the opposite of the one for columns ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 )    some calculations have also been performed with a relativistic kinematics , but the same conclusions can be drawn .",
    "we have just remarked that the agreement between masses is slightly less good than in the nonrelativistic case . to be complete ,",
    "let us mention that , with this kinematics , for systems with @xmath31 , the differences between masses computed with @xmath229 ( @xmath230 ) and those computed with @xmath230 ( @xmath229 ) and the string tension multiplied by @xmath270 ( @xmath273 ) appear at the 5th digit , which can be considered as relevant for the accuracy of our method .    the simulation based on the renormalized string constant originated from the hyperspherical formalism gives generally good results , better than those coming from the geometrical approach .",
    "nevertheless , for very asymmetrical systems , better results can be obtained with this last method .",
    "it is important to emphasize that using renormalized string tensions provides , in any case , much better results ( 6% in the worse case ) than keeping a single value of @xmath7 ( 17% in the worse case , 10% in the best ) .",
    "this study gives a strong confidence to use also a renormalized @xmath7 to simulate the genuine string junction .",
    "we consider the genuine confining three - body potential with a constant string tension @xmath7 and its various approximations .",
    "our quantitative results are presented in table  [ tab2 ] for a nonrelativistic kinematics .    in this paper",
    ", the spectra of the potential @xmath13 is obtained by a hyperspherical formalism containing grand momenta @xmath274 . for the moment , only binding energies of s - wave states have been computed .",
    "they are reported in column ( 1 ) and are used as a reference to test the quality of the various approximations .",
    "all other values have been computed with a harmonic oscillator basis up to 20 quanta .",
    "the accuracy of all binding energies is better than 1% .    in column",
    "( 2 ) , binding energies of the potential @xmath232 are presented .",
    "they are obtained with a value of string tension which is the same that the one used for @xmath13 .",
    "one can see that the numbers of columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) differ generally by less than 20 mev , with only a notable exception , the first excited s - wave state of the @xmath267 system .",
    "we can not say nothing about the p - wave states , but we can expect that the results from the @xmath232 potential are also close to those of the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "thus , it appears that the potential mixing equally the half perimeter and the centre of mass junction simulates quite well the genuine y - shape interaction .",
    "let us now discuss the quality of the spectra obtained with @xmath229 and @xmath230 and with a renormalized string tension as explained previously .",
    "we performed the calculation with a two - body confining potential of type @xmath26 and with a string constant either @xmath275 ( column  ( 3 ) ) or @xmath276 ( column  ( 5 ) ) .",
    "then we redo the calculation with a one - body confining potential of type @xmath11 and with a string constant either @xmath277 ( column  ( 4 ) ) or @xmath278 ( column  ( 6 ) ) .    by comparing data from columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in table  [ tab2 ]",
    ", we can see that the masses for baryons @xmath279 and @xmath280 are the practically the same ( differences are at the level of the 6th digit as described in the previous section ) and very close to the value of column ( 1 ) .",
    "this means that , for this kind of symmetrical systems , the simulation of the potential @xmath13 by interactions @xmath229 and @xmath230 , based on hyperspherical formalism , gives very good results .",
    "the situation is less favourable for asymmetrical systems . for @xmath265 and @xmath266 baryons ,",
    "the agreement between columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is still good , especially for the ground state .",
    "but for very asymmetrical systems such as @xmath267 and @xmath268 baryons , there can exist greater mass differences , up to about 100 mev . again , for the ground state , the agreement is still reasonable .",
    "let us remark that masses in column ( 4 ) are always greater than the corresponding ones in column ( 3 ) .",
    "the values of these two columns are in reasonable agreement with the reference results of column ( 1 ) .    within the geometrical approach ,",
    "the results of the two procedures of simulation are never in perfect agreement , as we can see in comparing columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , but the values obtained generally enclose the value of column ( 1 ) .",
    "let us note that the differences between a mass in column ( 5 ) and the corresponding one in column ( 6 ) are generally of the same order than the gap between values of columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "the renormalization of the string tension as suggested by the geometrical and the hyperspherical formalisms allows to compute with potentials @xmath229 and @xmath230 binding energies which are close to the ones obtained with the potential @xmath13 .",
    "it gives in any case much better results than the ones obtained keeping a fixed value of the string tension .    to be complete",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the same conclusions can be obtained with a relativistic kinematics , although in this case we can not compute the reference energies corresponding to the potential @xmath13 .      up to now",
    ", the analysis has been done for at least two identical particles .",
    "general analytical formulas in the case of three different particles are not available , except @xmath281 and @xmath282 in the hyperspherical formalism . in this case",
    ", we noted that the tensions are expressed by @xmath283    a first possibility to treat easily the problem of three different masses is to use the hypercentral approximation with @xmath284 , with the above expressions for @xmath282 and @xmath281 .",
    "this procedure would avoid a double numerical integration to get @xmath285 , whereas allowing results better than 2% .",
    "another possibility relies on the @xmath232 potential proposed in the previous section .",
    "we have verified that this approximation works well in the case of two or three identical particles .",
    "we can reasonably assume that it will be also good in the case of three different masses .",
    "in this paper , we studied three approximations of the genuine three - body confinement : a two - body potential @xmath229 equal to half perimeter of the triangle formed by the three particles , a one - body potential @xmath230 with the junction point at the centre of mass , and a mixing of both @xmath286 .",
    "two approaches were investigated to test the quality of these approximations : a geometrical one for which the important quantities are the various distances in the plane of the particles , another one based on the hyperspherical formalism . both give very similar and consistent conclusions .",
    "the potential energy @xmath230 overestimates the potential energy of the genuine junction by about 5% in most cases , and about 10% in extreme asymmetrical situation .",
    "the confining potential energy @xmath229 underestimates the potential energy of the genuine junction by about 8% . keeping the same value of the string tension in approximants",
    "can induced a 100 mev error in the calculated masses , as compared to the spectra obtained from the y - shape confinement . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath232 interaction simulates the potential energy of the y - shape interaction to better than 2% .",
    "thus , using @xmath232 with the same string tension than the genuine junction gives very good results at the level of the spectra . to obtain similar quality ( sometimes a bit better or a bit worse ) for the potentials",
    "@xmath229 and @xmath230 , it is necessary to renormalize the string tension by a mass dependent factor that can be analytically computed in the cases of two and three identical particles .",
