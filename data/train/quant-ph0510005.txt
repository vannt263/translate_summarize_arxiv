    "one of the most fundamental applications of non - classical light field states is the improvement of measurement precision beyond the standard quantum limits for classical light sources . of particular interest",
    "is the possible enhancement of phase sensitivity in interferometry @xcite , which could be useful in a wide range of fields , from quantum lithography @xcite to atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the optimal phase resolution @xmath3 that can be achieved using a non - classical @xmath4-photon state is given by the heisenberg limit of @xmath5 .",
    "recently , few photon interferometry at this limit has been accomplished by new methods of generating @xmath4-photon path entangled states using parametric downconversion and post - selection @xcite .",
    "such path entangled states are an equal superposition of the two @xmath4-photon states where all photons are located in the same optical mode , @xmath6 .",
    "they are therefore ideally suited to obtain @xmath4-photon interference fringes with a period of @xmath7 in the optical phase shift between the two paths . in principle",
    ", the generation of path entangled states can be extended to higher photon numbers using the methods proposed and realized in @xcite . in practice , however , the statistical bottlenecks in the post - selection ( or heralding ) used to generate the path entangled states rapidly reduce the probabilities of generating an appropriate output as photon number increases .",
    "it may therefore be useful to consider alternative few photon states that can be generated more efficiently from a given number of downconverted photon pairs .    in this paper",
    ", it is shown that a highly phase sensitive state can be generated by subtracting a single diagonally polarized photon from the @xmath8-photon state generated in collinear type ii downconversion . since",
    "single photon subtraction can be performed with equal efficiency for any number of input photons , this method could be very helpful in achieving phase resolutions at the heisenberg limit for higher photon numbers .",
    "moreover , the coherence induced between two adjacent photon number states ensures that the narrowness of the photon number distribution is maintained under phase shifts of up to @xmath2 .",
    "phase shifts at the heisenberg limit can therefore be observed as nearly deterministic transfers of a single photon between the output modes .",
    "the proposed experimental setup is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .",
    "the initial state generated by collinear type ii parametric downconversion is a superposition of photon number states with equal photon number in the horizontal and vertical polarizations , @xmath9 if it can be assumed that all of the emitted photons will eventually be detected , it is possible to isolate a single @xmath1-photon component by post - selecting only outputs where a total of @xmath1 photons are detected @xcite . effectively , the input state is then given by @xmath10 .",
    "this @xmath1-photon input component is reflected at a beam splitter with a reflectivity of @xmath11 close to one , and one photon is detected in the transmitted light .",

    "it is now possible to measure the diagonal polarization of the transmitted photon using a @xmath14-plate set at @xmath15 and a polarization beam splitter . this measurement projects the state of the transmitted photon onto an equal superposition of horizontal and vertical polarization , resulting in a conditional output state of @xmath16 in the reflected light .",

    "in conclusion , it has been shown that it is possible to obtain highly phase sensitive @xmath0-photon wedge states by photon subtraction from @xmath74 photon pairs generated in collinear type - ii parametric downconversion . since the post - selection condition for the generation of this state can be higher than 18% regardless of photon number , the only limitation in extending this scheme to high photon numbers is the efficiency of the parametric downconversion",
    ". the generation of five photon wedge states should therefore be well within reach of present technological capabilities .",
    "quantitatively , the phase sensitivity of wedge states is comparable to that of the recently realized path entangled states , with the advantage that a phase shift can be related directly to a shift in the photon number distribution observed in the output .",
    "specifically , phase shifts at the heisenberg limit appear as nearly deterministic transfers of one photon between the two output ports .",
    "@xmath0-photon wedge states should therefore be highly suitable for the determination of phase shifts @xmath52 of about @xmath2 .",
    "the generation of polarization wedge states by downconversion and photon subtraction thus provides a simple and effective experimental approach to phase measurements at the heisenberg limit with non - classical @xmath4-photon inputs .",
    "it should be noted that precise photon counting would require special detectors such as the ones described in s.kim , y.yamamoto , and h.h .",

    "are usually avoided by using downconverted light with @xmath105 much smaller than one .",
    "the effects of higher photon number components can then be neglected even if the detectors have limited quantum efficiencies and can not resolve photon number .",
    "however , this method limits the output intensity and makes it difficult to achieve high photon numbers .",
    "it may seem a bit counterintuitive that the subtraction of a photon causes the remaining photons to have the same polarization as the photon removed from the state .",
    "however , the effect can be understood quite clearly if one remembers that photon bunching implies that the photons preferably have the same diagonal polarization .",
    "a similar robustness of bipartite entanglement against the photon losses caused by limited detector efficiencies has recently been investigated in h.s .",
