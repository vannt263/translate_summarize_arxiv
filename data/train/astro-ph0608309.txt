    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; l@xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9l@xmath10 ) , discovered by the _ iras _ all sky survey , radiate the bulk of their luminosities as dust emission in the infrared @xcite .",
    "powerful energy sources , starbursts and/or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , must therefore be present , but hidden behind dust . since these lirgs dominate the cosmic infrared background emission , which is the sum of dust - obscured activity in the universe @xcite , distinguishing their energy sources is closely related to clarifying the connections between obscured agn and starbursts .",
    "the difficulty in disentangling an agn from a starburst as the primary energy source of a lirg comes from the fact that highly concentrated molecular gas and dust in a lirg s nucleus @xcite can easily _ bury _",
    "an agn in all directions .",
    "a luminous agn surrounded by torus - shaped dust is distinguishable from a normal starburst galaxy relatively easily through optical and infrared high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite because emission from the so - called narrow line regions ( nlrs ) , which are well developed along the torus axis above a torus scale height and are photoionized by the central agn s radiation , is visible from all directions @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of a _ buried _ agn in a lirg s core is difficult to unveil with this conventional type of spectroscopy because no significant nlrs are expected to develop .    even if a luminous buried agn is present in a lirg s core , starbursts are likely to coexist , surrounding the central agn . when such a starburst / buried - agn composite lirg is observed at wavelengths of large dust extinction , the observed flux is dominated by the less obscured starbursts , with a small contribution from the more highly obscured buried agn .",
    "it is therefore essential to observe at wavelengths of low dust extinction if we are to properly investigate the presence of a buried agn in a lirg s core .",
    "several useful methods for this purpose currently exist .",
    "the first is to observe in the hard x - ray band at e @xmath4 2 kev .",
    "since an agn is intrinsically a much stronger x - ray emitter than a starburst @xcite , the detection of strong but highly - absorbed x - ray emission can provide evidence of a luminous buried agn in a lirg s core .",
    "the second is millimeter interferometric searches for the chemical effects of the strong x - ray - emitting agn on the surrounding interstellar medium . around a buried agn , x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ; maloney et al .",
    "1996 ) should develop , rather than the photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) usually found in starburst regions .",
    "since the emission mechanism is different , xdrs and pdrs can be distinguished if they show different flux ratios of emission lines .",
    "the feasibility of carrying out this distinction has been demonstrated using hcn ( j = 10 ) ( @xmath11 = 3.3848 mm ) and hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) ( @xmath11 = 3.3637 mm ) emission lines in the millimeter wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the third method is infrared spectroscopy .",
    "while a normal starburst should always show large - equivalent - width polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features in the spectra at @xmath12 = 325 @xmath1 m in the rest - frame , an agn displays a pah - free continuum @xcite .",
    "infrared @xmath0-band ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy can also be used to separate starburst and agn emission , because a normal starburst displays co absorption features at @xmath12 = 2.32.4 @xmath1 m , whereas an agn does not @xcite . since",
    "a buried agn is generally more difficult to find with any method than the surrounding less obscured starbursts , using a combination of these potentially powerful approaches can increase the likelihood of detecting the elusive buried agn and help to draw a quantitatively consistent picture about the energetic importance of the buried agn .",
    "arp 299 ( @xmath13 = 0.010 ) is a nearby well studied lirg .",
    "it consists of three main merging components , the eastern component ic 694 ( arp 299 a ) and the western components making up ngc 3690 ( arp 299 b and c ) @xcite .",
    "the arp 299 b nucleus is divided into subcomponents ( b1 and b2 ) with a separation of @xmath62.5 arcsec in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the arp 299 c region is taken to be a `` non - nucleus''@xcite and consists of the c and c components with a separation of @xmath65 arcsec in the infrared @xcite .",
    "a component d is detected in the radio at 6 cm ( 5 ghz ) @xcite , but is not found in the deepest infrared image @xcite .",
    "the whole merging system has an infrared luminosity of l@xmath7 @xmath6 5 @xmath14 10@xmath9l@xmath10 (= 10@xmath15 ergs s@xmath16 ; see table 1 ) , approximately 60% of which comes from the a ( ic 694 ) nucleus , based on observations using the _ kuiper airborne observatory _",
    "although no explicit agn signatures have been found in any nucleus through optical spectroscopy @xcite , highly - absorbed ( compton - thick ; n@xmath17 @xmath4 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ) but intrinsically strong x - ray emission has been detected at e @xmath4 10 kev @xcite , suggesting the presence of a luminous buried agn .",
    "unfortunately , because of the lack of spatial resolution of the x - ray data at e @xmath4 10 kev , it is unclear which nucleus ( or nuclei ) possesses the buried agn .",
    "while the equivalent width of the 6.4-kev iron k@xmath20 line ( ew@xmath21 ) in higher spatial - resolution x - ray data at e @xmath22 10 kev was used to argue that a putative agn resides in nucleus b1 , at least @xcite , it is unclear whether an agn is present in any of the other nuclei because the 6.4-kev emission can be weak in a compton - thick _ buried _ agn @xcite .",
    "further observational data are required to better understand the role of the putative buried agn in arp 299 .    to spatially separate the subcomponents of the arp 299 merging system , observations with spatial resolution better than a few to 5 arcsec are desirable .",
    "ground - based infrared @xmath0- ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath2-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy using a large ( @xmath43 m ) telescope at a good observing site can achieve sub - arcsec spatial resolution and so is suitable for this purpose . at millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "interferometry is better suited than a single - dish radio telescope to obtain morphological information , by resolving the subcomponents , and to investigate the properties of molecular gas at nuclear regions where agns are thought to exist , by reducing the contamination from extended emission . in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of sub - arcsec - resolution infrared @xmath0- and @xmath2-band spectroscopy and millimeter interferometric maps with @xmath64 arcsec resolution , of the hcn ( j = 10 ) and hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) emission lines for the individual main merging components of arp 299 .",
    "the aim is to identify the location(s ) of the putative buried agn . throughout this paper , @xmath23 @xmath24 75 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16",
    ", @xmath25 = 0.3 , and @xmath26 = 0.7 are adopted , so that the distance to arp 299 is 40.3 mpc and 1 arcsec corresponds to 190 pc .",
    "infrared @xmath0- ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath2-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectra of the arp 299 a ( ic 694 ) , b and c were taken using spex @xcite attached to the irtf 3-m telescope atop mauna kea , hawaii , on 2005 april 27 ( ut ) .",
    "the 1.94.2 @xmath1 m cross - dispersed mode was employed , so that @xmath0- and @xmath2-band spectra were obtained simultaneously . for arp 299 ,",
    "narrowband imaging data centered on the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature were available @xcite and revealed that the 3.3-@xmath1 m pah emission is spatially extended , with a size of 2 to 3 arcsec .",
    "the imaging data can provide a rough absolute observed 3.3-@xmath1 m pah - emission luminosity and its ratio relative to the infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "we therefore chose a relatively narrow 08 wide slit , to pinpoint the continuum emission peak of each merging component where the putative agn may be located .",
    "accordingly , the extended starburst emission is not fully covered with our infrared spectra .",
    "we search for buried agn signatures at the nucleus , based on the _ equivalent width _ of emission and absorption features in the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bands , since these equivalent width values can not be obtained in detail from the narrowband imaging data @xcite . the resulting spectral resolution using",
    "this slit is r @xmath6 1000 in the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bands .",
    "observations of arp 299 a , b ( b1+b2 ) , and c were performed independently .",
    "the position angle of the slit was set along the north  south direction for arp 299 a and c , while for arp 299 b it was 37@xmath27 west - of - north to accommodate the signals from the b1 and b2 nuclei simultaneously @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of arp 299 c@xmath28 was not attempted because its @xmath0- and @xmath2-band fluxes reported in the literature @xcite are more than 1 mag fainter than the other components , and thus it would be difficult to obtain a meaningful spectrum within the limited observing time available to us .",
    "the total net on - source integration times were 60 , 60 , and 30 min for components a , b ( b1+b2 ) , and c , respectively .",
    "the sky conditions were photometric throughout the observations .",
    "the seeing at @xmath0 was measured to be in the range 0@xmath2981@xmath290 in full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) . a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern ) with a throw of 7@xmath295 was employed along the slit .",
    "the telescope tracking was monitored with the infrared slit - viewer of spex .",
    "each exposure was 15 sec , and 2 coadds were made at each position .",
    "the f8v main sequence star hr 4112 ( v = 4.84 ) was observed as a standard star , with an airmass difference of @xmath220.1 to the individual main merging components , to correct for the transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the magnitude of the standard star hr 4112 was estimated to be @xmath0 = 3.49 and @xmath2 = 3.45 , based on its @xmath30-band ( 0.6 @xmath1 m ) magnitude ( v = 4.84 ) and the color of an f8v star ( @xmath31 = 1.35 and @xmath32 = 1.39 ) @xcite . for reference ,",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitude of hr 4112 in the 2mass database @xcite is @xmath0 = 3.64@xmath330.22 mag , consistent with the above estimated value within the uncertainty .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were employed using iraf . initially , bad pixels and pixels hit by cosmic rays were replaced with values interpolated from the surrounding pixels .",
    "then , frames taken with an a ( or b ) beam were subtracted from frames subsequently taken with a b ( or a ) beam , and the resulting subtracted frames were added , then divided by a spectroscopic flat image .",
    "the spectral extraction of arp 299 merging components along the slit was then made by integrating signals over 3@xmath290 ( 0.15 arcsec pixel scale @xmath14 20 pixels ) because the emission is slightly spatially extended . for hr 4112 ,",
    "the actual image size along the slit tended to increase with decreasing wavelength , and was different for the different datasets taken at different times , due to changes in the seeing size .",
    "thus , the pixel number used for the spectral extraction of hr 4112 varied , but was usually smaller than the value of 3@xmath290 employed for arp 299 .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the wavelength - dependent transmission of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectra of arp 299 s individual merging components were divided by that of the standard star hr 4112 , and were multiplied by a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of 6000 k , corresponding to an f8v star @xcite .",
    "appropriate spectral binning was applied to reduce scatter .",
    "flux calibration was made using signals detected inside our slit spectra .",
    "since the employed slit width was comparable to or slightly smaller than the seeing size , our slit spectra may have introduced a small amount of flux ambiguity even for the compact ( spatially unresolved ) emission at the peak of each merging component . however , this ambiguity is not expected to exceed several 10% greatly because of the confirmed tracking accuracy of irtf spex .",
    "hence , our slit spectra can provide a _",
    "rough _ flux estimate for the compact emission .",
    "millimeter interferometric observations of hcn ( j = 10 ) ( @xmath34 = 3.3848 mm or @xmath35 = 88.632 ghz in the rest - frame ) and hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) ( @xmath12 = 3.3637 mm or @xmath36 = 89.188 ghz ) lines were performed with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) at nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) .",
    "the nma consists of six 10-m antennas .",
    "nma observations were performed in the d ( with longest baseline of 82 m ) , c ( 163 m ) , and ab ( 351 m ) configurations .",
    "the observing log is summarized in table 2 .",
    "the backend was the ultra - wide - band correlator , uwbc @xcite , which was configured to cover 1024 mhz with 128 channels at 8-mhz resolution .",
    "the central frequency was set to be 87.99 ghz , to cover the hcn and hco@xmath5 lines simultaneously , redshifted to @xmath687.75 ghz and @xmath688.30 ghz , respectively .",
    "the bandwidth of 1024 mhz corresponds to @xmath63500 km s@xmath16 at @xmath37 @xmath6 88 ghz .",
    "the field of view is @xmath677 arcsec at this frequency .",
    "since the hanning window function was applied to reduce side lobes in the spectra , the actual resolution was broadened to 16 mhz or 55 km s@xmath16 at @xmath37 @xmath6 88 ghz . to calibrate the passband across the 128 channels ,",
    "the bright quasar 0420@xmath38014 was observed at the beginning of each observing day .",
    "the quasar 1150 + 497 was used to calibrate temporal variations in the visibility amplitude and phase .",
    "standard data reduction was performed using the package uvproc - ii developed at nro @xcite .",
    "for all the data , antenna baselines , band - pass properties , and time variations of the visibility amplitude and phase were corrected .",
    "data taken during some parts of observing time showed large phase scatters , owing to bad radio seeing .",
    "these useless datasets were removed from our analysis . after clipping a small fraction of unusually high amplitude data , the data were fourier - transformed using a natural _ uv _ weighting .",
    "the flux - calibration of arp 299 was made by observing the quasar 1749 + 096 , whose flux level relative to uranus and neptune had been measured .",
    "a conventional clean method was applied to deconvolve the synthesized beam pattern . since arp",
    "299 consists of distinct merging components and thus shows a spatially extended structure , the primary beam pattern of the nma antenna was corrected .",
    "the total net on - source integration time of arp 299 was @xmath625 h. the synthesized beam size was 4@xmath292 @xmath14 3@xmath298 ( position angle is 26@xmath27 west of north ) , and the absolute positional uncertainty of the nma map is well below 1 arcsec .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present , respectively , the infrared @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectra of arp 299 a , b1 , and c. although arp 299 b1 and b2 were simultaneously observed , and signals from both the nuclei were recognizable , b2 turned out to be much fainter than b1 . in the literature ,",
    "the nuclear flux of b1 has been reported to be only a factor of 5 and 1.6 brighter than b2 in the @xmath2- and @xmath0-bands , respectively , when measured with a 12-arcsec aperture @xcite .",
    "however , the contrast of the nuclear @xmath2- and @xmath0-band flux of b1 , relative to b2 , is nearly an order of magnitude in our spectra .",
    "reliable spectral extraction of the much fainter b2 component was therefore very difficult . although we do not show infrared @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectra of b2 in this paper , it is less likely that a luminous buried agn is present in b2 because the small b2 to b1 flux ratio at 10 @xmath1 m @xcite suggests that dust emission heated by a putative buried agn in b2 is weak , and the infrared @xmath0-band spectrum of b2 is typical of a starburst galaxy , with no explicit agn signatures @xcite .      the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature is detected clearly at the infrared continuum peaks of the a , b1 , and c components ( figure 1 ) , suggesting the presence of a large amount of starburst activity there . to estimate the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah strength ,",
    "we adopt a template spectral shape for the galactic star - forming regions and nearby starburst galaxies ( type-1 sources ; tokunaga et al . 1991 ) , as we have done previously for other lirgs @xcite .",
    "the rest - frame 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission equivalent widths we measured are summarized in column 2 of table 3 .",
    "table 4 ( column 2 ) tabulates the observed flux of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission from the infrared continuum peaks . as noted in @xmath392.1 , unlike the equivalent width ,",
    "the pah _ flux _ can be subject to the effects of possible slit loss , even for spatially compact components , and so our flux estimates are only approximate .",
    "the @xmath2-band spectrum of b1 displays an absorption feature at the longer wavelength side of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature .",

    "next , the b1 and b2 nuclei were simultaneously observed in our spectra , and yet the @xmath2-band continuum level in b1 relative to b2 is more than 1 mag brighter than expected @xcite . unless the b2 flux has decreased substantially , a flux increase in b1 is strongly suggested .    in table 4 ,",

    "we mainly use the highest quality recent data taken by @xcite for comparison with our data . in the a nucleus ,",

    "the bulk of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission comes from b1 @xcite , and our estimate ( b1 ) and that by satyapal et al .",
    "( b1+b2 ) are similar to each other . in the c region ,",
    "the pah emission is extremely spatially extended @xcite , and the lower flux in our dataset can be explained by our smaller aperture , in addition to the above - mentioned pah flux overestimate from their data .",
    "overall , the comparison of pah flux measurements suggests that our absolute flux calibration is reasonable , and thus the @xmath2-band continuum flux increase in b1 as implied above should be real .",
    "some parts of the @xmath0-band spectra of the individual merging components of arp 299 have been previously obtained @xcite . for the a and c components , the co@xmath46 values , as well as the emission properties of the h@xmath42 s(1 ) and br@xmath44 ( table 5 ) , are similar for our results and older spectra @xcite . for the b1 nucleus , however , the rest - frame equivalent widths of both h@xmath42 s(1 ) and br@xmath44 emission lines in our data ( table 5 ) are a factor of @xmath63 smaller than those estimated from older data @xcite .",

    "an extended tail toward the southeast direction is recognizable in both hco@xmath5 and @xmath60co maps . for the c component ,",
    "an extended hco@xmath5 emission component is detected on the eastern side of the c peak , as was found in @xmath60co and @xmath61co maps @xcite . however , while the @xmath60co emission peaks at c and c , the hco@xmath5 emission , as well as the hcn emission @xcite , has a peak between the c and c components , suggesting that high - density ( n@xmath62 @xmath4 10@xmath63 @xmath19 ) molecular gas , as probed by hcn and hco@xmath5 , is more concentrated in the in - between region than the diffuse ( n@xmath62 @xmath6 10@xmath64 @xmath19 ) gas probed by @xmath60co .",

    "if we adopt a 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratio of @xmath610@xmath68 , typical for starbursts @xcite , then the luminosity of detected starbursts becomes 3.5 @xmath14 10@xmath69 ergs s@xmath16 , which is a factor of 5 below the measured infrared luminosity .",

    "taken at face value , it is quite possible that agn activity can play an important role energetically . in this section , we investigate in detail the nuclei containing buried agn .",
    "the infrared @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectra of the b1 nucleus favor the presence of a buried agn there , based on the following three main arguments .",
    "first , the equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission in the @xmath2-band spectrum is only ew@xmath57 = 7 nm , more than an order of magnitude below typical values found in starburst galaxies ( ew@xmath57 @xmath6 100 nm : moorwood 1986 ; imanishi & dudley 2000 ) .",
    "second , the co index in the @xmath0-band spectrum is co@xmath46 @xmath22 0.03 , much lower than typical values found in starburst galaxies ( co@xmath46 @xmath4 0.15 ; goldader et al .",
    "1997a , b ; ivanov et al .",
    "a strong contribution from a featureless continuum , most likely originating from hot dust heated by an agn , dilutes both the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission and 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption features .",
    "third , an increase in the @xmath2- and @xmath0-band continua is clearly recognizable , compared to old data taken about 510 years ago .",
    "since no major flux variation is expected in a starburst over this time period , an agn is the natural explanation .",
    "we conclude that the b1 nucleus contains a buried agn , as was previously argued based on observations of 210 kev x - ray emission @xcite and of the infrared 516 @xmath1 m band @xcite . assuming a galactic extinction curve of @xmath40/a@xmath41 = 0.0040.007 @xcite and a@xmath70 @xmath6 0.06 @xmath14 a@xmath41 @xcite",
    ", we can roughly estimate the dereddened luminosity of agn - heated dust in the b1 nucleus from the observed @xmath2-band spectrum ( optical depth of dust absorption features and observed continuum flux level at 3 to 4 @xmath1 m ) @xcite , which is 35 @xmath14 10@xmath71 ergs s@xmath16 .",
    "our infrared @xmath2-band spectrum of c displays a strong 3.1 @xmath1 m ice absorption feature with @xmath43 @xmath6 1.4 . for a buried agn",
    "in which the energy source is more centrally concentrated than dust , a foreground - screen dust - absorption geometry is applicable , while a mixed dust / source geometry is at work for a normal starburst in which stellar energy sources and dust are spatially well mixed @xcite . in a normal starburst with mixed dust / source geometry ,",
    "whose radiation density , and therefore the fraction of dust covered with an ice mantle , is similar to the well studied starburst galaxy m82 , the @xmath43 value is @xmath220.3 for any amount of dust extinction of the starburst @xcite . even if all dust is covered with an ice mantle ( @xmath72 = 1 in imanishi & maloney 2003 ) , the mixed dust / source geometry can only provide a maximum of @xmath43 @xmath6 0.7 , assuming the dust properties are similar to the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "this is because the observed flux is dominated by foreground , weakly obscured , less attenuated emission , with a small contribution from obscured , highly attenuated emission at the far side , in this mixed dust / source geometry .",
    "the large @xmath43 value in the arp 299 c component ( @xmath61.4 ) would require a foreground - screen dust geometry . a centrally concentrated energy source , such as a buried agn ,",
    "may be present , in addition to a normal , pah - emitting starburst ( figure 1 ) .",
    "alternatively , if a large amount of foreground - screen dust exists exterior to the normal starburst core ( e.g. , in an edge - on host galaxy ) , then the large @xmath43 can be explained .",
    "however , the ew@xmath57 value is @xmath640 nm in c. in this geometry , the ew@xmath57 value should have the value usually found for normal starbursts ( @xmath6100 nm ) because both pah and continuum emission are attenuated in a similar manner .",
    "dilution of the pah emission by pah - free continuum from an energy source other than a normal starburst is indicated from the @xmath2-band spectrum of c. in the c component , the observed co@xmath46 value ( @xmath60.1 ) is also smaller than expected for a normal starburst ( @xmath40.15 ) .",
    "dilution by the featureless @xmath0-band continuum , possibly from agn - heated hot dust or stars younger than @xmath610@xmath73 yr @xcite , is required to explain this result .",
    "unlike the a and b nuclei , arp 299 c+c@xmath28 is thought to be a non - galaxy nucleus @xcite . under the assumption of an eddington mass accretion rate ,",
    "a more massive black hole is necessary to produce a larger agn luminosity , and supermassive black holes are generally present at galaxy nuclei . whether the c component possesses a sufficiently large supermassive black hole for agn activity is less clear than for the other arp 299 nuclei .",
    "@xcite noticed a weaker co absorption feature in the @xmath0-band spectrum of c , but attributed its weakness to the youth of the starbursts .",
    "if a very active super star cluster with an infrared luminosity of l@xmath7 @xmath6 10@xmath74l@xmath10 @xcite is formed in the innermost regions of dense molecular gas and the radiation density there is so high as to destroy pah molecules @xcite , then a large @xmath43 value and pah - free featureless @xmath2-band continuum @xcite may be produced .",
    "for the nuclei of ultraluminous infrared galaxies with l@xmath7 @xmath4 10@xmath60l@xmath10 , energy sources that are more centrally concentrated than dust would require both large luminosity and high surface brightnesses , for which agns are the natural explanation @xcite .",

    "has long been suggested to be the most probable agn - harboring nucleus , based on near - infrared color @xcite , compact high surface - brightness radio emission @xcite , and starburst modeling @xcite .",
    "however , our infrared @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectra reveal no explicit agn evidence in this nucleus : its ew@xmath76 and co@xmath46 values are typical of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent high - quality infrared data @xcite have also failed to provide clear agn signatures from a. although @xcite inferred the presence of an agn in the a nucleus , based on the presence of 6.7 kev ionized iron emission , their argument is weaker than that based on the 6.4-kev iron k@xmath20 line for the b1 nucleus .",
    "if a luminous buried agn is present in the arp 299 a nucleus , the agn must be more elusive than in b1 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed that agn - dominated galaxy nuclei ( xdrs ) tend to show higher hcn ( j = 10 ) to hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) and hcn ( j = 10 ) to co ( j = 10 ) brightness - temperature ratios than starburst - dominated galaxy nuclei ( pdrs ) , and thus that these ratios can be used to distinguish the two types of galaxies . in particular ,",
    "both the hcn and hco@xmath5 molecules have similarly large dipole moments ( @xmath1 @xmath6 34 debye ; millar et al .",
    "1997 ; botschwina et al .",
    "1993 ) and so probe similarly high - density ( n@xmath62 @xmath4 10@xmath63 @xmath19 ) molecular gas .",
    "hence , the hcn / hco@xmath5 ratios are very useful for distinguishing between the two galaxy types , being unaffected by different dense - to - diffuse molecular gas fractions in different galaxies .",
    "imanishi et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2006b ) applied this method to a few lirg nuclei , and successfully found high hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios in lirgs known to possess luminous buried agns based on previously obtained data at other wavelengths .",
    "an hcn _ abundance _ enhancement in xdr chemistry of dense molecular gas around a strong x - ray illuminating source ( meijerink & spaans 2005 ; their fig.10 , model 4 ) can naturally explain the high hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios in luminous agns , whether the hcn and hco@xmath5 emission is optically thin or thick @xcite .",
    "we use the hcn and hco@xmath5 flux measurements obtained with the nma , to apply this energy diagnostic method to the individual merging components of arp 299 . for arp 299 ,",
    "hcn and hco@xmath5 measurements using a single - dish radio telescope are available @xcite .",
    "however , our interferometric data have the following advantages over the single - dish measurements : although single - dish radio data measure the hcn and hco@xmath5 emission from the combined b+c regions , our interferometric data can clearly resolve b and c because of better spatial resolution . in addition",
    ", we can probe the dense molecular gas for regions confined to the nuclei where putative agns are expected to reside , by reducing the contamination from extended starburst emission .",
    "the xdr volume can be large in a _",
    "pure _ buried agn with no starburst activity .",
    "however , in a starburst / buried - agn composite galaxy , such as the majority of lirgs , strong xdr signatures are expected only in the nuclear region in the close vicinity of a luminous x - ray - emitting agn .",
    "spatially extended molecular gas can be affected by the surrounding starbursts and thus show properties expected from pdrs . for the purpose of finding xdr signatures in starburst / agn composite lirgs , such as arp 299 , investigating the hcn / hco@xmath5 ratios in regions confined to the nuclei , based on high - spatial - resolution interferometric data , is superior to using single - dish data .",
    "furthermore , in the old single - dish data , hcn and hco@xmath5 observations were made at different times , whereas for our nma interferometric data , the hcn and hco@xmath5 lines were simultaneously obtained , so that possible uncertainties due to time - variable observing conditions and intercalibration are minimized , making the discussions of the hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature _ ratios _ reliable .",
    "figure 8 shows the hcn ( j = 10 ) to co ( j = 10 ) ( abscissa ) and hcn ( j = 10 ) to hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) ( ordinate ) ratios in brightness temperature of arp 299 and other galaxies . for the arp 299 merging components ,",
    "the hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios are directly derived from our nma data , while the hcn / co ratios are taken from the older interferometric data of @xcite .",
    "the arp 299 a , b , and c components show low hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios , as observed in starburst - dominated galaxy nuclei .",
    "table 10 summarizes the detection or non - detection of agn signatures based on various methods . since",
    "a luminous buried agn is almost certainly present in the b1 nucleus , we must consider why no xdr signature is found in b based on the hcn / hco@xmath5 ratio .",
    "several explanations are possible , but whichever scenario is correct , we have to conclude that the hcn / hco@xmath5 method may miss some types of buried agn despite their detection at other wavelengths .    first , the dereddened agn luminosity at the b1 nucleus derived from our infrared @xmath2-band spectrum is l@xmath7(agn ) @xmath6 35 @xmath14 10@xmath71 ergs s@xmath16 ( @xmath394.2.1 ) .",
    "the absorption - corrected 210 kev x - ray luminosity is @xmath65 @xmath14 10@xmath77 ergs s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if we apply 210 kev to the bolometric luminosity correction of @xmath61020 @xcite , the estimated agn luminosity becomes roughly similar , within a factor of 23 , to the value quoted above based on our infrared @xmath2-band spectrum .",
    "however , the detected starburst luminosity in the b1 nucleus is estimated to be l@xmath7(sb ) @xmath6 45 @xmath14 10@xmath71 ergs s@xmath16 based on the observed 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission luminosity ( this work ; satyapal et al .",
    "1999 ) and on the ratio of l@xmath78/l@xmath7 @xmath6 10@xmath68 found in starbursts @xcite .",
    "if we assume dust extinction of a@xmath41 = 615 mag for the detected starbursts in b @xcite , the extinction - corrected starburst luminosity can increase to l@xmath7(sb ) @xmath6 710 @xmath14 10@xmath71 ergs s@xmath16 .",
    "thus , in the b nucleus , the starburst luminosity is comparable to the agn luminosity .",
    "the presence of high - density molecular gas strongly affected by this luminous starburst component may hide the signatures of xdrs traced by our hcn / hco@xmath5 method .",
    "second , for the hcn / hco@xmath5 method to work in finding xdr signatures , the high - density molecular gas , as probed by hcn and hco@xmath5 , must be sufficiently close to be affected by the central agn s x - ray radiation . in the double nuclei merging lirg ngc 6240 , the hcn and hco@xmath5 emission peaks are not at individual nuclei , but in the internuclear region where shocks are important @xcite . in arp 299 , although the hco@xmath5 emission peak from b ( b1+b2 ) appears to coincide with the b1 nucleus in our interferometric map with 4@xmath292 @xmath14 3@xmath298 spatial resolution ( figure 4 ) , it is possible that the actual distribution is slightly displaced from the exact position of the b1 nucleus to the b2 side , and shocks may play a major role .",
    "it is known that shock regions show enhanced hco@xmath5 abundance @xcite , which can decrease the hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratio , compared to a pure buried agn .",
    "in fact , shocks driven by starburst superwinds are found to be prominent in the whole area of the arp 299 merging system @xcite .",
    "these spatially extended shocks at the surface of the buried agn may decrease the hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratio measured toward the b1 nucleus .",
    "third , an increase in agn luminosity compared to older data is indicated in our infrared spectra of b1 ( @xmath394.2.1 ) .",
    "some time lag may perhaps occur between the onset of an active agn phase and the stage when the x - ray - emitting agn can chemically affect the surrounding high - density molecular gas .",
    "if the very active agn phase has just started , then the low hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratio may be explained if the surrounding molecular gas has not been subjected to sufficient chemical effects .",
    "finally , the hcn / hco@xmath5 abundance ratio is highly dependent on the density and distribution of molecular gas surrounding a central x - ray - emitting agn @xcite .",
    "the arp 299 merging components may have different molecular gas distributions ( e.g. , density and geometry ) from other lirgs for which our hcn / hco@xmath5 method succeeded .",
    "further detailed chemical calculations are needed to interpret more unambiguously the observed hcn / hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios in galaxies .",
    "we performed infrared @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectroscopy of the arp 299 a , b1 , and c regions to identify the location of the putative compton - thick buried agn , revealed by recent x - ray data .",
    "emission and absorption features found in the @xmath2- and @xmath0-band spectra were used to distinguish between an agn and a starburst .",
    "millimeter interferometric maps of simultaneously taken hcn ( j = 10 ) and hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) molecular lines were also presented for the arp 299 a , b ( b1+b2 ) , and c regions . using the interferometric maps , we determined the spatial distribution of these molecules and derived the hcn / hco@xmath5 ratios in brightness temperature , to search for possible chemical signatures of the putative x - ray - emitting buried agn to the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "we obtained the following main conclusions .    1 .",
    "our infrared spectra strongly suggested that a luminous buried agn is present in the b1 nucleus , based on a very low equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission in the @xmath2-band spectrum , a very weak 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption feature in the @xmath0-band spectrum , and a major increase in the @xmath2- and @xmath0-band continuum fluxes compared to between 5 and 10 years ago .",
    "our results supported previous arguments that the b1 nucleus hosts an agn .",
    "the dereddened agn luminosity from our infrared @xmath2-band spectrum was quantitatively comparable to that based on x - ray observations at e @xmath4 10 kev .",
    "our infrared spectra of the non - galaxy - nucleus arp 299 c showed a large optical depth of 3.1 @xmath1 m ice absorption ( @xmath43 @xmath6 1.4 ) in the @xmath2 band , and a weak 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption feature ( co@xmath46 @xmath6 0.1 ) in the @xmath0 band .",
    "although a buried agn is a plausible explanation , multiple young super star clusters are also a possibility , given the small infrared luminosity of arp 299 c ( l@xmath7 @xmath6 10@xmath75l@xmath10 ) .",

    ", we found no explicit evidence for an agn .",
    "our millimeter interferometric maps confirmed that continuum emission is detected in the a , b , c , and c regions and that hcn ( j = 10 ) emission has a strong peak at the a nucleus .",
    "the flux and spatial distribution of the continuum and hcn emission were similar to those from previously obtained interferometric maps .",
    "we presented the first interferometric map of arp 299 in hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) line emission .",
    "hco@xmath5 emission was clearly detected in the arp 299 a , b , c , and c regions . in the c and c regions , the hco@xmath5 emission peaks between these regions",
    "this spatial distribution is similar to that of hcn , but is unlike the distribution of @xmath60co ( j = 10 ) , which shows peaks in the c and c components .",
    "we conclude that high - density molecular gas , as probed by the hcn and hco@xmath5 lines , has been swept to the in - between regions , while the more diffuse gas traced by @xmath60co has not .",
    "we measured hcn / hco@xmath5 ratios in brightness temperature for the a , b ( b1+b2 ) , and c regions , and compared the ratios with those of agn- and starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "the ratios in the three arp 299 regions , even in the agn - hosting b1 nucleus , were as low as seen in starburst - dominated galaxy nuclei , possibly because of the effects of coexisting starbursts and/or shocks .",

    "<S> we present ground - based infrared @xmath0- ( 22.5 @xmath1 m ) and @xmath2-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy , as well as interferometric observations at @xmath3 3 mm , for the individual merging components ( a , b , and c ) of the luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the presence and location of the putative buried active galactic nucleus ( agn ) inferred from previous x - ray observations at e @xmath4 10 kev . </S>",
    "<S> our sub - arcsec - resolution infrared spectra clearly reveal that the putative buried agn resides in the nucleus b1 ( a subcomponent of b ) , based on a very low equivalent width of 3.3 @xmath1 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission , a weak 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption feature , and a large time variation of the @xmath0- and @xmath2-band continuum fluxes . in component c </S>",
    "<S> , we find strong 3.1 @xmath1 m ice absorption at @xmath2 and weak 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption at @xmath0 , as expected in a buried agn ; however , a centrally concentrated young super star cluster is an alternative possibility because of the modest infrared luminosity and non - galaxy - nucleus nature of this component . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared @xmath0- and @xmath2-band spectra of the infrared brightest nucleus , a , are typical of a normal starburst with no explicit agn signatures . </S>",
    "<S> our interferometric observations simultaneously obtain hcn ( j = 10 ) and hco@xmath5 ( j = 10 ) emission lines with @xmath64 arcsec resolution , and we find the hcn to hco@xmath5 brightness - temperature ratios to be as low as those found in starburst nuclei in all the major merging components of arp 299 </S>",
    "<S> . the low ratio even in the agn - hosting nucleus b may be due to the presence of a large amount of high - density molecular gas whose chemistry is dominated by coexisting starbursts and/or shocks , rather than by the central strong x - ray - emitting agn . </S>"
