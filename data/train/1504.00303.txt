    "we call the resulting lattice the _ dragon lattice_. on this lattice , james propp introduced a family of regions called _ aztec dragons _ @xcite , as an analogue of _ aztec diamonds _ @xcite . figures [ dragonnew](a)(d ) show the aztec dragons of order @xmath5 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 , respectively ( see the shaded regions ) .",
    "james propp conjectured that the number of tilings of the aztec dragon is always a power of @xmath0 ( see problem 15 in @xcite ) .",
    "the conjecture was proven by ben wieland ( in unpublished work , as announced in @xcite ) and ciucu ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 7.2 ) ) .",
    "in particular , they showed that :    the number of tilings of the aztec dragon of order @xmath7 is @xmath8 .",
    "a _ perfect matching _ of a graph @xmath9 is a collection of disjoint edges covering all vertices of @xmath9 .",
    "the tilings of a region @xmath4 can be identified with the perfect matchings of its _ dual graph _ ( the graph whose vertices are fundamental regions in @xmath4 and whose edges connect precisely two fundamental regions sharing an edge ) . in the view of this , we denote by @xmath10 the number of perfect matchings of a graph @xmath9 .",
    "the dual graph of an aztec dragon is called an _ aztec dragon graph_.     for @xmath11.,width=453 ]    a further proof of the aztec dragon theorem was provided by cottrell and young @xcite , by using the domino shuffling method on the aztec dragon graphs .",
    "they also proved a related result for aztec dragon graphs of half - integer order ( see figure [ dragongraph ] ) .",
    "recently , the aztec dragon graphs have been investigated under the relations to cluster algebras ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced a larger family of @xmath0-parameter graphs called _ aztec castles _ and proved that the numbers of perfect matchings of these graphs are always some power of 2 ( see theorem 2.1 @xcite ) .    in this paper , we extend the family of the aztec dragons to two new families of @xmath1-sided regions , which we call _ dragon regions _ ( the precise definition of a dragon region will be provided in section 2 ) . by using kuo s graphical condensation method @xcite , we prove that the number of tilings of a dragon region is always given by powers of @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( see theorem [ dragonthm ] )",
    ". the result generalizes the aztec dragon theorem as well as the related results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 5 we point out that our method can be used to obtain a related result when the tiles of the aztec dragons carry some weights .",
    "moreover , by the same technique , we obtain new families of regions having similar structure whose tilings are also enumerated by powers of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "our goal in this section is to generalize the family of aztec dragons .    the centers of the hexagonal fundamental regions on the dragon lattice form a triangular lattice .",
    "we consider a six - sided contour on this triangular lattice as follows .",

    "we adjust @xmath17 so that @xmath12 and @xmath18 are on the same vertical line . finally , we close the contour by go @xmath19 units down or up depending on whether @xmath18 is above or below @xmath12 ( see the dotted contour in figures [ dragonnew2](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the above choice of @xmath17 requires @xmath20    the vertex @xmath18 is above or below @xmath12 when @xmath13 is less or greater than @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath22 , then the closure of the contour deduces that @xmath23 ; in the case where @xmath24 , the closure implies @xmath25 . thus , we always have @xmath26    next , we consider the region @xmath4 consisting of all fundamental regions that are restricted or intersected by the contour ( see the union of all fundamental regions in figures [ dragonnew2](a ) and [ dragonnew3](a ) ) .",
    "we now remove all the boundary squares of @xmath4 .",
    "we also remove the boundary hexagons and the triangles adjacent to the boundary squares along the @xmath14- and @xmath17-sides as well as the @xmath19-side if @xmath22 .",

    "it implies that @xmath296 on the other hand , by the definition of the functions @xmath268 and @xmath297 , we have @xmath298 therefore , we only need to verify that @xmath299 let us prove the first equality in ( [ check ] ) .",

    "one of these families is the  needle rhombi \" introduced by the author ( see theorem 25 @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ newneddle ] shows the needle rhombus of order @xmath2 .",
