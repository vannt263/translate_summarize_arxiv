    "in a spectrum sharing ( ss ) system , the optimal power allocation ( opa ) should satisfy the maximum allowable interference level at the primary system , additionally to the constraint on the average transmit power , and thereby to guarantee reliable operation for the primary users ( pus ) as presented comprehensively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this additional interference power constraint on the transmit power of the secondary transmitter ( su - tx ) can be assumed either as peak or averaged value , denoted as peak interference power constraint ( pip ) and average interference power constraint ( aip ) respectively . in case of the pip application , the opa results in the conventional method with one lagrange multiplier , which can be iteratively calculated using the widely known water - filling algorithm ; however , in case of the aip application , the opa yields to two lagrange multipliers @xcite , and hence another type of algorithm is required to calculate both multipliers simultaneously . moreover ,",
    "an analysis is required in order to calculate the transmit power and the corresponding performance of multi - user diversity ( mud ) .    to this end ,",
    "the contribution of this paper is two fold : a ) the application of mud with opa in ss systems assuming aip constraint by devising an algorithm based on bisection method in order to jointly calculate the two lagrange multipliers and b ) the end - to - end snr analysis for the rayleigh and nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels with one pu and multiple pus . the benefit of the aip constraint over the pip constraint is depicted through the numerical results .",
    "notably , @xcite has highlighted the benefit of aip over the pip in a single - user application scenario named as interference diversity .",
    "to our knowledge , such an investigation in a multi - user environment has not been provided so far , as we describe in a profound way in the following literature review .    to be specific , ban et al . in @xcite",
    "investigate the effects of mud in an ss system applying pip constraint for the protection of the primary receiver ( pu - rx ) .",
    "based on this model , authors derive the ergodic capacity over rayleigh fading channels for the high power snr regime considering one pu - rx and multiple pu - rx . in @xcite , ekin",
    "investigate the ss system proposed by ban et al . in terms of hyper - fading communication channels for the secondary and primary links .",
    "they also derive the corresponding probability density function ( pdf ) and the cumulative density function ( cdf ) considering pip constraint and peak transmit power .",
    "li in @xcite and @xcite investigates opportunistic scheduling through mud in ss systems with multiple su - rxs over rayleigh fading channels and derives the outage and effective capacities considering pip constraint as well as the uplink scenario in an ss system with multiple su - rxs deriving the achievable bit error rate and mean capacity using an outage capacity formulation .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is presented .",
    "section iii gives the formulation of mud with opa in ss with aip constraint and section iv provides the end - to - end snr over fading channels .",

    "we consider a spectrum sharing ( ss ) system that consists of a secondary network with one secondary transmitter denoted as su - tx and @xmath1 secondary receivers denoted as su - rxs that utilizes a spectral band that is licensed to the primary system .",
    "the primary system is considered with @xmath2 multiple primary receivers denoted as pu - rxs .",
    "the instantaneous channel power gains from the su - tx to the different su - rxs and pu - rxs are denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively with @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "all channel gains are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) exponential random variables with unit means in independent rayleigh and nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels and independent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with random variables denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the primary and secondary links respectively with mean zero and variance @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the su - tx regulates its transmit power through the power control ( poc ) mechanism that provides transmission with power constraints at both secondary and primary links in order to satisfy the requirements for transmission and protection at the su - rxs and the pu - rxs simultaneously .",
    "we assume that the power constraints at the poc of the su - tx are applied for keeping the transmit power budget at the secondary links under a predefined level , which is assumed as an average @xmath10 value , as well as for keeping the interference power at the primary links at a tolerable level , which again is assumed as an average @xmath11 value .",
    "we also assume that perfect channel state information ( csi ) is available at the su - tx from the su - rxs and the pu - rxs through a feedback channel @xcite .",
    "the su - tx provides multi - user diversity ( mud ) in secondary network by which it is able to select for transmitting information among multiple su - rxs to the one with the best received snr .",
    "the received snr at the @xmath12 su - rx is given as @xmath13 , where the interference from the primary network is assumed negligible .",
    "this section provides the analysis of mud with opa in ss .",
    "the opa in ss when both average interference and transmit power constraints are considered is obtained as follows @xcite @xcite : @xmath14 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lagrange multipliers @xmath15 and @xmath16 are related to the aip constraint @xmath11 and the average transmit power constraint @xmath10 respectively .",
    "notably , assuming pip constraint , the opa is related to the lagrange multiplier @xmath15 only @xcite , which is obtained using the well known water filling algorithm @xcite .",
    "the calculation of lagrange multipliers @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be accomplished either separately or jointly using the following inequalities : @xmath17\\leq i_{av}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath18\\leq p_{av}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] elaborating more on these calculations , we denote as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and provide the following details in their analysis : @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\mu}^{\\mathcal{\\infty } } \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\mathcal{\\infty } } x \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\lambda + \\mu x } - \\frac{1}{y } \\right ) f(x ) f(y ) dx dy \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\mu}^{\\mathcal{\\infty } } \\int_{\\lambda}^{\\mathcal{\\infty } } \\left ( \\frac{1}{\\lambda + \\mu x } - \\frac{1}{z } \\right )",

    "this provided by @xcite and @xcite for ss without incorporating mud .",
    "obviously , the end - to - end snr analysis of pdf @xmath24 for mud , where @xmath21 , has not been provided so far and this will be accomplished in this paper , in the following section , for rayleigh and nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels with one and multiple pu - rxs .    regarding the calculation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 lagrange multipliers ,",

    "we assume now multi - user diversity ( mud ) , whereby the su - tx selects the su - rx with best channel quality among all su - rxs .",

    "this was expected since the probability that the su - tx will find an su - rx with the best snr condition using mud technique increases and the probability that the su - tx will find a pu - rx in which the maximum interference level will be reached increases , leading to capacity increase and decrease respectively .",
