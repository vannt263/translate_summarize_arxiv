    "the empirical correlation between black hole ( bh ) mass and bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ) and stellar velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) have stimulated the notion that bhs evolve jointly with their host galaxies , mediated perhaps through feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , di  matteo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "many issues affect our detailed understanding of the relationship between bhs and their hosts , including ( 1 ) the evolution of bh mass , accretion rate , and spin , ( 2 ) the assembly and evolution of galaxies , and ( 3 ) the mutual interaction between bhs and galaxies .",
    "a simple comparison of the mass density of bhs in local galaxies with the integrated energy density of quasars ( sotan 1982 ) leads to the conclusion that radiatively efficient accretion , with an average efficiency of @xmath5 , is the main driver of bh growth ( small & blandford 1992 ; chokshi & turner 1992 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if the angular momentum of the accreting material is aligned with the spin of the bh and remains constant , we expect the bh to spin up to its maximum rate after accreting one - third of its mass , and attain @xmath6 ( thorne 1974 ) , in apparent conflict with the efficiency deduced from sotan s argument .",
    "this inconsistency can be plausibly resolved if bhs are fed by episodic , random accretion ( king & pringle 2006 ) , which has a tendency to spin down the bh over time ( king et al . 2008 ) .",
    "if this , indeed , is the main mechanism for bh growth , we predict that the radiative efficiency of quasars should decrease from high to low redshift .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to test this prediction observationally . by comparing the cosmic history of bh accretion with the better - established cosmic history of the star formation rate",
    ", we can further constrain the purported joint evolution of central bhs and their host galaxies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; croton et al . 2006 ; wang et al . 2007 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we set up a formalism to describe the dependence of @xmath0 on the luminosity density , growth rate , and duty cycle of quasars .",
    "we apply it to survey data and show that @xmath0 evolves strongly with redshift , which we interpret as a signature of bh spin - down as a consequence of episodic , random accretion .",
    "our calculations assume a standard cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "following sotan s argument , we assume that the growth of bhs comes mainly from accretion during their active ( agn ) phases . from its definition ( marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , the radiative efficiency is @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the cumulative increases of the energy and the mass density of bhs from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "we can define the duty cycle as the ratio of the number density of quasars ( @xmath17 ) to that of active and inactive galaxies ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 which can be equivalently expressed as ( wang et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass density of quasar bhs and @xmath22 is the mass density of all gas accreted onto bhs until @xmath15 .",
    "the mass density of quasar bhs can be obtained from @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass function of bhs with the break given by @xmath25 . since quasars can increase their masses only via accretion ( i.e. @xmath26 ) , we have , using the equivalent formulation of the duty cycle , the cumulative increase of the mass density @xmath27 the cumulative energy density can be obtained through @xmath28 where @xmath29 is cosmic time , @xmath30 is the bolometric luminosity density , @xmath31 is the bolometric luminosity function ( lf ) of quasars ( hopkins et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the lower limit @xmath32 , given by the break in the lf , is determined from quasar surveys .",
    "we then have the @xmath10equation : @xmath33 equation ( 6 ) is striking in that it describes @xmath0 in terms of @xmath34 , which combines the growth and the episodic cycles of bhs with the evolution of their host galaxies .",
    "this equation has the advantage of only depending on observables : ( 1 ) @xmath21 , which can be reasonably estimated from empirical relations calibrated against reverberation mapping ; ( 2 ) @xmath35 , which in principle can be estimated from deep galaxy surveys ; and ( 3 ) @xmath36 , which can be directly obtained from quasar lfs .",
    "furthermore , the equation directly gives @xmath0 at any redshift , whereas the usual sotan s argument requires a comparison of the accreted mass density of bhs with the local mass density of bhs to get the averaged radiative efficiency over time ( sotan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "these features allow us to deduce the radiative efficiency as a function of redshift from observables .",
    "equation ( 6 ) can be applied to existing survey data .",
    "we use the duty cycle expressed by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the number densities of quasars and galaxies from their luminosity functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath42 is wavelength - dependent ( wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) , being less sensitive to stellar population changes at longer wavelengths ( ilbert et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath38 from the rest - frame @xmath43band lfs of galaxies up to @xmath1 derived from the deep _ hst _  study of dahlen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ) of ilbert et al .",

    "( 2008 ) , but use the corrected value for @xmath45 and the new value for @xmath46 in kelly et al .",
    "the samples of quasars and galaxies used in these lfs overlap in at least some survey fields , minimizing potential observational biases .",
    "we relate the lower limits of the galaxy lf ( @xmath47 ) and the bh mass function ( @xmath25 ) through the bh - bulge mass relation of mclure & dunlop ( 2002 ) , which we assume to be invariant with redshift ( cf . ho 2007 ) .",
    "the completeness of the bh mass function depends on both the flux limit of sdss and the widths of the broad emission lines . the adopted bh mass function of vestergaard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , complete only for @xmath48  @xmath49 , yields @xmath50 mag , which corresponds to @xmath51 erg  s@xmath52 if bright quasars have an average eddington ratio of @xmath53 ( shen et al .",

    "we fit the variation of @xmath54 with @xmath15 using a polynomial @xmath55 ; the coefficients @xmath56 are given in table 1 .",

    "the large uncertainties in the photometric redshifts for low-@xmath15 galaxies preclude us from deriving @xmath54 directly for @xmath57 ; in this regime , @xmath54 is extrapolated from the analytical fits at higher redshift .",
    "we hope to remedy this situation with future surveys .",
    "our main results are summarized in figure  2_a_. we find ( 1 ) @xmath58 at @xmath1 , and ( 2 ) a strong cosmological evolution , with @xmath0 decreasing to @xmath590.03 by @xmath3 .",
    "the low value of @xmath0 in the local universe agrees with the results from the continuity equation of the bh number density ( merloni & heinz 2008 ) .",
    "the high values of @xmath0 at large @xmath15 are consistent with the estimate from the cosmic x - ray background ( elvis et al .",
    "2002 ) , which is mainly contributed by agns at @xmath60 . at this epoch ,",
    "the spin angular momentum of bhs may originate mainly from the orbital momentum in major bh coalescences ( i.e. bh binaries with mass ratio @xmath61 ; those with mass ratio @xmath62 are referred to as minor coalescences ) ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "the strong evolution in @xmath0 provides important constraints on the accretion history of bhs .",
    "there are two ways for bhs to grow ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) : ( 1 ) major and minor bh coalescences and ( 2 ) accretion of gas . while major coalescences do contribute some angular momentum to bhs ( hughes & blandford 2003 ) , accretion is the main contributor to their masses ( king et al .",
    "an initially non - rotating bh rotates very fast after accreting about one - third of its mass with the same sign of angular momentum ( thorne 1974 ) , and its radiative efficiency approaches the maximum value of @xmath63 .",
    "however , the net angular momentum contributed to accreting bhs depends on whether the accretion is prograde or retrograde , as described below .",
    "supposing that accretion occurs randomly and episodically in quasars , then , at episode @xmath64 with angular momentum @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 , we have ( as in a random walk ) , after @xmath67 episodes , the net angular momentum @xmath68 and @xmath69 , whereas the growth in mass @xmath70 . the specific angular momentum of an accreting bh , @xmath71 decreases with the number of accretion events .",
    "consistent with the numerical simulations of king et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we expect @xmath72 to decrease with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 offers strong observational support for this picture .",
    "the episode number @xmath67 can be estimated by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the episode lifetime and @xmath75 is the age of the universe at redshift @xmath15 . for @xmath1 , we have @xmath76 ( fig .",
    "1_c _ ) , @xmath77gyr , and @xmath78myr as estimated from the proximity effect of @xmath1 quasars ( kirkman & tytler 2008 ) , and hence @xmath79 .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 decreases by a factor @xmath80 from @xmath1 to @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", random accretion may occur through disks whose masses are limited by self - gravity ( king et al . 2008 ) to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the height of the disk at radius @xmath83 .",
    "we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the factor by which the bh mass has been increased due to accretion .",
    "the rough consistency between these two estimates of @xmath67 suggests that the random accretion events originate from a self - gravitating disk .",
    "additionally , the gas accreted onto bhs is only a tiny fraction of the gas content of the entire galaxy ( @xmath87 ) , so the net angular momentum from accretion should be independent of the total angular momentum .",
    "the evolution of the radiative efficiency found here does not favor accretion with consistently prograde angular momentum , as would occur if the typical accretion event has much larger aligned angular momentum than the bh ( volonteri et al .",
    "2007 ; berti & volonteri 2008 ) .",
    "rather , this study strongly favors a picture in which most of the mass in bhs was gained through random accretion .",
    "accretion rates of @xmath88  yr@xmath52 are needed to generate the prodigious luminosities seen in quasars .",
    "such large amounts of fuel can not be sustained by internal sources ( e.g. , stellar mass loss ) ; they almost certainly require external triggers , in the form of major gas - rich galaxy mergers and interactions .",
    "how do major mergers lead to episodic , random accretion ? numerical simulations and direct observations ( see schweizer 1998 for review ) show that gas - rich mergers drive large quantities of gas to the circumnuclear region of the merger remnant , where a large portion of the fuel gets consumed in a starburst . the mechanisms by which gas gets further funneled to smaller scales relevant for feeding agns are unclear ( see wada 2004 for a review ) .",
    "but two things are certain : the gas in the circumnuclear region is clumpy , and in order for the gas to accrete , it must get rid of most of its angular momentum .",
    "this can be accomplished by clump - clump collisions , especially in a turbulent environment .",
    "such a process is inherently random , and the material that manages to fall in carries little or no memory of its original angular momentum .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the original source of gas derives from a major merger , the final , individual accretion events are essentially random , small fragments .",
    "we derive a simple formalism to link the radiative efficiency parameter @xmath0 with the luminosity density , bh mass density , and duty cycle of quasars . applying this formalism to existing survey data of quasars and galaxies ,",
    "we show that @xmath0 evolves strongly with redshift , with values of @xmath89 at @xmath90 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "a straightforward interpretation of this trend is that the bhs in the quasar population begin with high spins at early times , but they gradually spin down to the present day .",
    "we suggest that accretion events onto bhs are inherently random and episodic , and that this mode of accretion naturally reduces their spin .      from the expression for @xmath93",
    ", we can derive @xmath94 , the cosmic history of bh accretion .",
    "figure  2_b _ shows that @xmath95 closely traces @xmath96 , the cosmic history of the star formation rate density . in agreement with earlier studies ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) , this suggests that the history of bh growth generally follows the history of stellar mass build - up in galaxies , at least for redshifts up to @xmath97 .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the generation of strong radio jets in radio - loud agns remains largely a mystery .",
    "bh spin is often implicated as a critical parameter ( e.g. , sikora et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the principal result of this study is that the average spin of bhs in quasars decreases with decreasing redshift .",
    "if a large spin is required to produce strong jets , we would naively expect the fraction of radio - loud quasars to rise toward higher redshift .",
    "this is the opposite of what is actually observed in the sdss sample of quasars studied by jiang et al .",
