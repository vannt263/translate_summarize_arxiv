    "interestingly , there is accumulating evidence for the existence of additional relativistic degrees of freedom .",

    "interestingly , it was recently pointed out that the observed deuterium abundance d / h also favors the presence of extra radiation  @xcite : @xmath15 @xmath16 was derived from the cmb and d / h data  @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing that the cmb data as well as the helium and deuterium abundance favor additional relativistic species , @xmath17 , while they are sensitive to the expansion rate of the universe at vastly different times",
    ".    the extra radiation may be dark radiation composed of unknown particles .",
    "then it is a puzzle why it is relativistic at the recombination epoch , why the abundance is given by @xmath17 , and why it has very weak interactions with the standard - model particles .",
    "in fact , there is a well - motivated particle with the desired properties , namely , the qcd axion .",
    "the axion appears in the peccei - quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , one of the solutions to the strong cp problem  @xcite , in association with the spontaneous breakdown of the pq symmetry .",
    "the axion remains extremely light : its mass is originated from the qcd anomaly and is in the range of @xmath18ev for the pq breaking scale in the cosmological window , @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , in a supersymmetric ( susy ) framework , the saxion tends to dominate the energy density of the universe , and it decays mainly into a pair of axions .",
    "such non - thermally produced axions naturally remain relativistic until present .",
    "thus , the axion is a plausible candidate for the dark radiation . by decaying particles ( e.g. saxion to two axions , and gravitino to axion and axino )",
    "was studied in ref .",
    "the light gravitinos produced by inflaton decay can account for dark radiation in analogous to ref .",
    "see also recent refs .",
    "the possibility that the @xmath20 particle was in thermal equilibrium was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    in this paper we consider the qcd axion as a candidate for the dark radiation , and show that the branching fraction of the saxion into axions naturally falls in the right range , if the axion multiplet is coupled to the higgs superfields as in the dine - fischler - srednicki - zhitnitsky ( dfsz ) axion model  @xcite .",
    "most important , we find that the @xmath0-parameter is bounded from above , namely @xmath1 gev for the saxion lighter than @xmath2 , and @xmath0 less than the saxion mass otherwise , independent of the pq scale @xmath21 . as we shall see later , if the radiative corrections play an important role in the stabilization of the saxion , its mass can be naturally smaller than the soft masses for the susy standard model ( ssm ) particles .",
    "this implies that , even if the other susy particles are so heavy that they are above the reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the higgsino should remain within the reach of the lhc and/or future collider experiments such as international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "this will be of great importance especially if the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is indeed around @xmath22gev as suggested by the recent data from atlas and cms at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the axino production from the decay of both higgsino and saxion . in our scenario ,",
    "the dark matter is made of the axion in the form of non - relativistic coherent field oscillations and the axino lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , while the axion produced by the saxion decay accounts for the dark radiation .",
    "thus , the axion and its superpartners play an important role to account for the dark matter and dark radiation .",
    "let us begin by examining the properties of the saxion in a simple pq extension of the minimal ssm ( mssm ) where the pq sector consists of the axion superfield @xmath23 and @xmath24 pairs of pq messengers @xmath25 forming @xmath26 representation of su(5 ) : w_pq = y_s | .",
    "since the saxion is a flat direction in the supersymmetric limit , its properties are determined by how susy breaking is transmitted to the pq sector .",
    "it is natural to expect that the pq messengers , which are charged under the sm gauge groups , feel susy breaking in the same way as the mssm superfields do .",
    "the pq messengers radiatively generate a potential for the saxion after susy breaking @xcite , as well as an effective coupling of @xmath23 to the gluon supermultiplet that implements the pq mechanism . to see this",
    ", one can integrate out @xmath25 under a large background value of @xmath23 , which results in [ k - s ] l_eff = d^4 z_s(q = y_|s|)|s|^2 .",
    "there then arises a potential , @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the soft scalar mass squared of @xmath23 , and @xmath29 is the renormalization scale .",
    "hence , if @xmath28 is positive at a high scale and the messenger yukawa coupling is large enough to drive it negative through radiative correction , @xmath30 develops a minimum along @xmath31 around the scale where @xmath28 changes its sign . at the minimum",
    ", the khler potential ( [ k - s ] ) gives masses to the saxion and axino m^2_&= & _ y^2_(m^2_+m^2_|+a^2 _ ) ~m^2_soft , + m_a & = & _ y^2_a_~a _ , where @xmath32 is a soft scalar mass squared , and @xmath33 is the trilinear soft parameter associated with @xmath34 .",
    "the saxion acquires a mass suppressed by a factor @xmath35 relative to other superparticle masses @xmath36 , and the axino has a small mass @xmath37 . from the effective khler potential , one can also find the saxion couplings ( ( ^a)_a + ( _ am_a aa + h.c . ) ) , where @xmath38 is the axion decay constant .",
    "the model - dependent parameter @xmath39 is generally of order unity , and the saxion coupling to the axino _ a = .",
    "|_q = c_af_a generically has a value in the range between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    on the other hand , depending on the mediation mechanism of susy breaking",
    ", @xmath30 alone may not be able to stabilize @xmath23 .",
    "this happens , for instance , in gauge mediation , where only those carrying sm gauge charges acquire soft susy breaking masses at the messenger scale @xmath42 .",
    "an interesting way to give a soft mass to the gauge singlet @xmath23 at @xmath42 is to consider mixing between @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) and the messenger fields transferring susy breaking @xcite .",
    "then , there is an additional contribution to soft masses for the pq sector fields , while the mssm sector feels susy breaking only through the gauge mediation .",
    "the additional contribution makes @xmath30 develop a minimum in the same way as discussed above . turning off the mixing",
    ", the saxion potential runs away to infinity , but can be lifted by supergravity effects @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gravitino mass . for a positive @xmath47 of order unity and @xmath46 not so small compared to @xmath36 , @xmath23",
    "is stabilized below @xmath42 by @xmath48 .",
    "the situation is different when @xmath49 , for which the supergravity effects become important at @xmath31 larger than @xmath42 . , where @xmath25 generate a potential for the saxion at the three - loop level @xcite .",
    "this results in that the saxion has a mass of the order of @xmath46 , and the axino acquires a tiny mass @xmath50 , where @xmath51 comes from the pq messenger loops while @xmath52 is due to the supergravity contribution .",
    "the coupling @xmath53 has a value about @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . ]",
    "we close this subsection by stressing that the potential generated by pq messenger loops is naturally expected to play an important role in stabilizing the saxion in models where the pq symmetry is spontaneously broken mainly by a single pq field .",
    "then , the saxion and axino are generally lighter than the mssm superparticles .",
    "let us move to the cosmology of the saxion .",
    "the saxion has a very flat potential lifted only by the susy breaking effect , and so , the saxion potential may be significantly modified during inflation , because susy is largely broken by the inflaton potential energy .",
    "in particular , the so - called hubble - induced mass term generically deviates the saxion from the low - energy potential minimum .",
    "for instance , the saxion may be stabilized at a large field value close to the planck scale in the presence of the negative hubble - induced mass term . in this case , the saxion starts to oscillate with a large initial amplitude when the hubble parameter becomes comparable to the saxion mass @xmath56 .",
    "then the saxion would dominate the energy density of the universe , if the reheating temperature of the inflaton is higher than the saxion decay temperature .",
    "alternatively , the pq symmetry may be restored during and/or after inflation . in particular , since the pq messengers generate a thermal potential for the saxion , @xmath57 at @xmath58 , the saxion could be thermally trapped at the origin if it sits around the origin after inflation . in this case thermal inflation @xcite takes place when the saxion potential energy at the origin ( @xmath59 ) dominates the universe .",
    "thus , it is plausible that the saxion dominates the energy density of the universe . in the rest of the paper , we assume that this is indeed the case , and discuss how the saxion decay proceeds .",
    "if @xmath23 has no other interactions with the mssm sector than the loop - induced coupling to the gluon supermultiplet , the saxion dominantly decays into axions with a branching ratio @xmath60 : b_a = = , where @xmath61 is the total decay width of the saxion .",
    "this is obviously problematic in a scenario where the universe experiences a saxion - dominated epoch .",
    "a natural way to suppress @xmath62 is to introduce a coupling of @xmath23 to the higgs doublets so that a higgs @xmath0 term is dynamically generated after pq symmetry breaking . among various types of couplings , we take the kim - nilles superpotential term @xcite [ kn ] w = h_uh_d , which generates an effective @xmath0 term = , around the weak scale for @xmath63 and @xmath64 gev , and thus naturally explains the smallness of @xmath0 .",
    "problem , one may instead consider the giudice - masiero mechanism @xcite implemented by a khler potential term @xmath65 . in this case , however , the couplings of the saxion to the mssm sector arise at the loop level . ]",
    "the above superpotential term also induces couplings of the saxion to the mssm particles .",
    "these couplings are proportional to @xmath66 , and open up the possibility to obtain @xmath67 from the axions non - thermally produced by saxion decays .",
    "to evaluate @xmath62 , one needs to know interactions of the saxion with the mssm particles . for simplicity , we consider the decoupling limit where the effective higgs sector below @xmath36 consists only of a sm - like higgs doublet and other heavy higgs bosons decouple from the theory .",
    "then , the saxion has the interactions ( 1- ) h h + ( h_u h_d + h.c . ) , both of which are directly induced from ( [ kn ] ) . here",
    "@xmath68 is the cp - even neutral higgs boson , @xmath69 is the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson , and @xmath70 is the higgs mixing soft parameter .",
    "the coefficient @xmath71 reflects the form of the coupling between @xmath23 and the higgs doublets .",
    "in addition , the saxion interacts with other mssm particles as well because there arises mixing between the saxion ( axino ) and neutral higgs ( higgsinos ) after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "these couplings can be read off from the mssm lagrangian by taking the substitution h & & ( 1- ) , where @xmath72 .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the partial decay widths of the saxion into sm particles and higgsinos , which are presented in the appendix .",
    "the important decay channels are those into @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and into a higgsino pair , depending on @xmath56 .",
    "we note that @xmath62 is determined essentially by @xmath0 and @xmath56 , but insensitive to @xmath21 .",
    "the saxion interacts with the sm particles more strongly for a larger @xmath0 , making @xmath62 smaller .",
    "in this section , we examine the condition for the axion dark radiation produced at saxion decays to yield @xmath67 in the presence of the superpotential term ( [ kn ] ) that is responsible for generating a @xmath0 term .",
    "then , we also examine if the axino can constitute the dark matter of the universe with the correct amount of a relic density .",
    "our analysis does not assume any specific mechanism of the saxion stabilization , but the radiative potential induced by the pq messengers may play an important role in fixing the vacuum expectation value of @xmath23 . keeping this in mind , we shall consider the case where the saxion and axino have masses lighter than @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noted that the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath0 , on which @xmath62 crucially depends , does not need to be related to the scale @xmath36 because it is a supersymmetric coupling .",
    "the axions produced at the saxion decays have never been in thermal equilibrium for the saxion decay temperature much lower than @xmath78 @xcite , which is the case we shall deal with . the energy density of non - thermalized axions and thermalized radiation evolves as _",
