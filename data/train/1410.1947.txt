    "to understand the formation of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase and to study the structure of the qcd phase diagram , a beam energy scan ( bes ) program has been carried out in the years 2010 and 2011 at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) facility  @xcite where au+au collisions were recorded at @xmath1 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , and 62.4 gev .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy  @xcite is one of the most important observables in relativistic nuclear collisions for studying the bulk behavior of the created matter . in non - central au+au collision",
    ", the overlap region has an almond shape ( in each event ) with the major axis perpendicular to the reaction plane , which is defined by the impact parameter and the beam direction . due to fluctuations , the participant plane  @xcite in each event",
    "is not necessarily the same as the reaction plane .",
    "as the system evolves , the pressure gradient converts the anisotropy from coordinate space to momentum space .",
    "the produced particle distribution  @xcite can be written as :    @xmath3),\\ ] ]    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle of a particle , @xmath6 is the @xmath7-th harmonic event plane angle reconstructed by the observed particles , which is an estimation of the participant plane , and @xmath8 is the @xmath7-th harmonic event plane resolution .",
    "the second harmonic coefficient @xmath9 reported here is called elliptic flow .",
    "several interesting observations related to @xmath9 have been reported in the past decade by using data from the top rhic heavy - ion collisions energy of @xmath1 200 gev  @xcite . at low transverse momenta ( @xmath10 2.0 gev/@xmath11 ) ,",
    "a mass ordering of the @xmath9 values was observed  @xcite , which could be understood within a hydrodynamic framework . at intermediate @xmath12 , ( 2 @xmath13 6 gev/@xmath11 ) , a number - of - constituent quark ( ncq ) scaling  @xcite of @xmath9 for identified hadrons",
    "was observed .",
    "this observation , coupled with comparable values of the elliptic flow measured for multi - strange hadrons ( @xmath5 and @xmath14 ) and light quark hadrons , was used to conclude that the relevant degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons for the matter formed in the early stage of heavy ion collisions at the top rhic energy  @xcite .    the mass ordering in the low @xmath12 range and the ncq scaling in the intermediate @xmath12 range were also observed in bes experiments  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the blast wave model  @xcite to fit @xmath0 data at @xmath1 7.7  2760 gev to get the energy dependence of the mean radial flow expansion velocity .",
    "the blast wave model is an approximation to the full hydro calculations , which were only done for bes inclusive charged hadron data  @xcite , not for identified particles due to complications of the equation - of - state and the initial conditions .",

    "the nuclear fireball model  @xcite was introduced by westfall",

    "this model assumes that a clean cylindrical cut is made by the projectile and target and leaves a hot source in between them .",
    "protons emitted from this fireball should follow a thermal energy distribution .",
    "later , siemens and rasmussen  @xcite generalized a formula by bondorf , garpman , and zimanyi  @xcite which was valid for non - relativistic velocities , to be fully relativistic assuming an exploding fireball producing a blast wave of nucleons and pions .",
    "two decades ago , schnedermann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a simple functional form with only two fit parameters : a kinetic temperature ( @xmath15 ) and a radial velocity ( @xmath2 ) which was successfully used in fits to @xmath12 spectra .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a third parameter , the difference of the radial velocity in and out of the reaction plane , to describe transverse anisotropic flow generated in non - central collisions .    however , the blast wave fit matched data even better after the star collaboration added a fourth parameter  @xcite to take into account the anisotropic shape of the source in coordinate space .",
    "we use the blast wave parametrization with four parameters mentioned above  @xcite : kinetic freeze - out temperature ( @xmath15 ) , transverse expansion rapidity ( @xmath16 ) , the amplitude of its azimuthal variation ( @xmath17 ) and the variation in the azimuthal density of the source elements ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the blast wave equation we use is :    @xmath19k_{1}[\\beta_{t}(\\phi_{s})][1 + 2s_{2}\\cos(2\\phi_{s})]}{\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\phi_{s } i_{0}[\\alpha_{t}(\\phi_{s } ) ] k_{1}[\\beta_{t}(\\phi_{s})][1 + 2s_{2}\\cos(2\\phi_{s})]}. \\label{lab_bw_func}\\ ] ]    @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are modified bessel functions where @xmath22 $ ] , and @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "it should be noticed that the masses for different particle species only enter via @xmath24 in @xmath25 .",
    "when we perform the simultaneous fits , which will be explained below , the masses for different particle species are the only differences between the fits to different particle species .",
    "the basic assumptions of this blast wave model is a boost - invariant longitudinal expansion  @xcite and freeze - out at a constant temperature @xmath15 on a shell  @xcite , which expands with transverse rapidity exhibiting a second harmonic azimuthal modulation given by @xmath26  @xcite . in this equation",

    "furthermore the fits are separated for the particle group ( @xmath36 and @xmath31 ) and the anti - particle group ( @xmath37 and @xmath33 ) , as we know from the bes experiments that their @xmath9 values at the same @xmath12 are different  @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath5 mesons are used twice for both particles and anti - particles .",
    "all @xmath0 data in each group are fitted simultaneously . for the fits ,",
    "statistical and systematic errors of the data were added in quadrature . as we do not have spectra for most of the energies",
    ", we can not constrain the temperature ; therefore we input a temperature in a reasonable range  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath39 100 mev , 120 mev and 140 mev as input .",
    "the fit lines in the following figures are for @xmath39 120 mev , the other two temperatures are considered to determine the systematic variation and are shown in the summary fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] .",
    "pions are excluded from the fits at energies below @xmath34 2.76 tev , as a significant fraction of the pions at those energies come from resonance decays  @xcite , and therefore might behave differently from the expected blast wave parametrization .",
    "the alice collaboration has reduced the feed - down contributions from long lived particles to their @xmath40 = 2.76 tev results by selecting tracks with a small distance of closest approach to the primary event vertex  @xcite .",
    "other particles , like protons and kaons , are also affected by feed down from heavier particles and would therefore show deviation from the blast wave parametrization . for a correct feed down correction one needs particle spectra , an estimation of resonance production , and a detailed understanding of the kinematic and topological cuts applied . since this information is not yet available , we therefore estimated the feed down effects with a monte carlo ( mc ) calculation . the inputs for the mc were particle and resonance yields estimated from the thermus statistical hadronization model  @xcite , and we used a parametrization  @xcite for the energy dependence of the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath15 and baryon chemical potential @xmath41 .",
    "we further used boltzmann distributions to sample the transverse momenta of the parent particles .",
    "the flow of resonances was estimated using the blast wave fits .",
    "this implies that an iterative process would be needed for a more detailed study .",
    "the decay kinematics of various particles and resonances ( @xmath5 , @xmath31 , @xmath14 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , n@xmath45 , @xmath46 ) was calculated to get the modified flow and transverse momenta of the daughter particles which contribute to the measured @xmath0 . for pions a total feed down contribution from resonances of 60%",

    "figure  [ fig : feeddown ] shows the size of the effect , but for the fits shown in this paper no feed down corrections were applied due to the uncertainties as discussed above . however , to estimate the feed - down effect on the fit results and the @xmath47/ndf we redid all fits by root - mean - square adding to every data point a @xmath9 value of 0.003 for @xmath48 7.7200 gev based on our feed - down studies .",

    "solid lines depict blast wave fits to the data , whereas dashed lines are predictions , for pions , using the parameters from the fits to the other particles .",
    "the data points and fit curves for charged kaons are not shown in the figures as they are similar to the @xmath38 mesons .",
    "a clear mass ordering in data and fits is observed for all energies : for the same radial flow , the heavier particles have larger @xmath12 values and therefore , at the same @xmath12 lighter particles have larger @xmath9 values .",
    "if we assume that this splitting is due to radial flow , then the boost in the @xmath12 direction gets larger with increasing beam energy , which is equivalent to a larger radial flow .    in general a fair description for protons and kaons can be obtained . on the other hand",
    "we observe that for all energies the predicted curves for @xmath109 have similar trends as the data points but are systematically lower .",
    "it can not be excluded that such a behavior for pions is a result from feed down as discussed in section  [ sec_feeddown ] .",
    "the fit curves for @xmath5-meson are higher than the data points for all energies except for @xmath1 62.4 gev .",
    "it is argued that @xmath5-mesons have a small hadronic cross sections  @xcite compared to other hadrons under consideration . in that case , one expects a lower @xmath5-meson @xmath9 and therefore also a deviation from the blast wave fits .",
    "we want to point out that the weight of the @xmath5-meson data in the simultaneous fits is low due to their relatively large error bars .",
    "a fit without @xmath5-mesons included gives almost identical results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] b ) we show the corresponding results for the anti - particle group ( @xmath110 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the @xmath111 data is not shown for the same reason as for the @xmath112 mesons .",
    "the data show a larger spread along the @xmath9 or @xmath12 axes , respectively , compared to the particle group .",
    "the simultaneous fits to all anti - particles are significantly better .",
    "even trends like the negative values for anti - protons in the low @xmath12 range at @xmath113 11.5 gev are reproduced .",
    "similar to the particle group , the pions are systematically above the blast wave predictions for all energies .",
    "the @xmath5-mesons , which are supposed to behave differently from the other particles due to their smaller hadronic cross section , fit into the systematic of the other particles in that group .",
    "in contrast to the behaviour seen in the particle group , the splitting of the data points among different anti - particle species decreases with increasing beam energy . at lower energies , the splitting for the anti - particle group is larger than for the particle group , but the difference between the two groups is decreasing with increasing beam energy . at @xmath113 62.4",
    "gev the @xmath9 data for both groups , and accordingly the fits , are already very similar .",
    "if we assume that the mass ordering in the low @xmath12 region is only due to radial flow , then the difference in the splitting of particles and anti - particles indicates that the transverse expansion velocity is different for particles and anti - particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] depicts the transverse expansion velocity @xmath2 , which is extracted from the blast wave fits , as a function of beam energy with three different input temperatures as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_procedure ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath16 values are shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "the transverse expansion velocities for anti - particles are systematically higher than the ones for particles at all energies below @xmath113 200 gev , whereas the difference between particles and corresponding anti - particles decreases with increasing beam energy .",
    "the latter is equivalent to the observation that the difference of @xmath9 between particles and anti - particles is decreasing with increasing beam energy  @xcite , therefore the transverse expansion velocity extracted from the blast wave fits becomes similar for both groups .",
    "we also observe that the transverse expansion velocity for the particle group increases monotonically with energy , while the transverse expansion velocity for the anti - particle group decreases with energy up to @xmath113 200 gev , but then appears to increase , becoming identical with that of the particle group at @xmath1 200 and 2760 gev .",
    "qualitative explanations for a lower anti - particle @xmath9 compared to particles in the energy range of 7.7 @xmath114 39 gev were discussed recently  @xcite .",
    "various effects , like quark potentials or baryon stopping / baryon chemical potential , might be responsible for the observed difference in @xmath9 . in the following we reconsider possible scenarios for different radial flow patterns for particles and anti - particles .",
    "it is probable that anti - particle production at lower beam energies happens at the very early stage of the collision , where the energy density is high , either via thermal production or in a hard collision .",
    "therefore , the produced anti - particles go through the whole expansion stage and get a larger transverse expansion velocity than the particles which could be produced at a later stage . at higher beam energies",
    "the production processes for particles and anti - particles becomes similar , which results in a smaller difference in @xmath0 ( fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : netp ] depicts the multiplicity rapidity density at mid - rapidity for 0%5% central collisions for protons , anti - protons , and net - protons as a function of the center - of - mass energy @xmath40 .",
    "the anti - proton yield is monotonically rising with increasing @xmath40 , opposite to the net - proton yield ( @xmath115 - @xmath116 ) , which is decreasing .",
    "this is an indication for reduced baryon stopping at higher energies .",
    "the amount of stopped protons at @xmath117 60 gev exceeds the yield of produced protons .",
    "the proton @xmath118 shows a minimum around that energy .",
    "it was speculated that the elliptic flow for produced and stopped particles might be different  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect might be true for radial flow , which could explain the poorer description with the blast wave model of the particle group compared to the anti - particle group .",
    "the deviation between @xmath5-mesons and other particles might also be a result of the baryon stopping effect , which means @xmath5-mesons behave similar to other produced particles ( anti - particles ) .",
    "in other words , the produced protons , which should follow the blast wave description , are contaminated at lower energies by stopped protons .",
    "in that case one should not trust to a certain level the results of a combined fit which includes particles with @xmath119 or @xmath120 quarks .    the few produced anti - protons in the collision center at lower energies might be annihilated due to the large absorption cross section and the large number of surrounding protons . mainly anti - protons produced near the surface , where the radial flow is larger , may survive .",
    "this effect should decrease with increasing @xmath40 , where the @xmath121 ratio is getting larger .",
    "therefore the @xmath2 values for anti - particles are getting closer to the ones of particles .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : netp ] show that the anti - particle @xmath2 ( 0%80% ) is following the trend of the central proton @xmath122 , which indicates a correlation between the two observables .",
    "the proton @xmath2 shows an opposite trend to net - proton .",
    "because the transverse velocity extracted from particles are dominated by net - protons ( stopped protons ) at the lower beam energies , the net - protons show a smaller transverse velocity than produced protons .",
    "proton and anti - proton transverse momenta spectra at the different energies and the use of finer collision centrality bins could shed light on the strength of the anti - proton absorption effect .",
    "the falling trend of @xmath2 for anti - particles from @xmath113 7.7 to 200 gev is opposite to the expectation for a hydrodynamic expanding system , which should show an increasing radial expansion velocity with increasing energy density .",
    "it is furthermore intriguing that the flow dependence on transverse momentum for anti - particles at @xmath113 11.5 ( 0%80% ) and 2.76 tev ( 0%60% ) are almost identical .",
    "the @xmath9 comparison can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2_comparison ] . in between ,",
    "either @xmath9 at constant @xmath12 is rising , or the boost in @xmath12 for constant @xmath9 is decreasing with increasing energy . both scenarios might be directly correlated since @xmath9 is an azimuthal modulation of the radial flow .",
    "there is almost no difference of the @xmath18 and @xmath17 parameters between particles and anti - particles ( shown in table  [ table ] ) .",
    "this is an indication that the driving force behind the difference of the @xmath9 values between particles and corresponding anti - particles in the low @xmath12 region is due to the different @xmath2 parameters . on the other hand a consistent description of all anti -",
    "particles was achieved assuming that the radial expansion velocities for anti - protons and other anti - particles are different . in that case , other blast wave fit parameters than @xmath16 compensate this difference .",
    "a simultaneous fit of @xmath0 and particle spectra would reduce those ambiguities .",
    "the scenario of different flow fields for particles and anti - particles shows the importance of a careful treatment of the initial and final state in future hybrid hydrodynamic calculations in the bes energy region .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter shows an increasing trend with increasing beam energy , which means the @xmath9 values should increase with increasing energy , like already observed in ref .",
    "simultaneous blast wave fits for @xmath0 , separated for particles and anti - particles , from 0%80% ( 0%60% ) central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions at @xmath1 7.72760 gev were presented . in general a reasonable description of the mass ordering of @xmath0 in the low @xmath12 range",
    "was achieved .",
    "we observed that blast wave fits for the anti - particle group are significantly better at @xmath117 62.4 gev compared to the particle group .",
    "feed down effects were discussed , and it was shown that they might have a substantial impact on the observed small deviations form the blast wave expectation . the blast wave expectation for @xmath5 meson",
    "were shown to be systematically above the data for the particle group , whereas a consistent description for the anti - particles was attained .",
    "that might either show that @xmath5 mesons have a smaller radial or elliptic flow due to smaller hadronic cross section in comparison to the particle group , or that they follow the flow pattern of the anti - particle group which could be an indication for a distorted flow pattern in the particle group .",
    "an energy dependent difference of the transverse expansion velocity @xmath2 between particles and corresponding anti - particles was observed at @xmath117 62.4 gev .",
    "@xmath2 is decreasing for anti - particles from @xmath40 = 7.762.4 gev , whereas the expansion velocity is monotonically increasing with @xmath40 for the particle group .",
    "we discussed various effects , like anti - particle absorption , the early production of anti - particles , or the influence of stopped baryons on the radial flow of protons , which might explain the observed pattern . to distinguish those effects",
    "one needs the future particle spectra , finer centralities , and more statistics , especially for @xmath5 mesons at energies below @xmath40 = 19.6 gev .",
    "this will be achieved with the planned beam energy scan ii program at rhic with a focus on energies below @xmath40 = 20 gev  @xcite and an expected increase in statistics of a factor 510 .",
