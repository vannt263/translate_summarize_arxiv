    "this allows us to bound the r - parity violating interactions that appear in extensions to the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we find the relic density of the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) using the standard cosmological model .",
    "we then allow these particles to decay via the hadronic r - parity violating operators .",
    "we employ simple models for the production rate and the propagation of the antiprotons .",
    "we can limit the r - parity violating couplings with observations of the antiproton spectrum in cosmic rays .",
    "our results strictly apply when the lifetime of the neutralino is longer than the age of the universe",
    ". however , there are other cosmological limits based on nucleosynthesis in the early universe , recent structure formation , diffuse photon and neutrino fluxes , and spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background that cover a large fraction of neutralino lifetimes shorter than the age of the universe , and may well completely close the gap between this result and laboratory constraints .",
    "the supersymmetric model we consider is a minimal extension of the standard model with explicit r - parity breaking , defined by the superpotential @xmath10 @xmath11 are generation indices ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the su(2)-doublet lepton and quark superfields ; @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the singlet superfields ; and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the doublet higgs superfields .",

    "a simple parameterization suffices .",
    "we assign a common mass scale @xmath26 to the sleptons and squarks at the electroweak scale , we relate the gaugino mass parameters @xmath27 by means of gut relations , and we keep the trilinear soft terms @xmath28 and @xmath29 only for stop and sbottom",

    "they consist of @xmath34 models that satisfy the experimental constraints reported by the particle data group @xcite , plus the bounds on the higgs sector and chargino masses from lep ( we update to lep2w  @xcite ) and the constraints on the @xmath35 rate from cleo @xcite . the scans span values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 up to 5 tev , of @xmath26 up to 3 tev , of @xmath38 and @xmath39 up to @xmath40 , of @xmath33 up to 1 tev , and of @xmath41 between 1 and 50 .",
    "this range extends even beyond the parameter region usually considered as plausible .",
    "we do not assume that the dark matter is supersymmetric in nature .",
    "given a supersymmetric model , the relic density of neutralinos is fixed and calculable in the standard cosmological model .",
    "we use the relic density computed by edsj and gondolo @xcite , who include all neutralino self - annihilation diagrams , resonance and threshold effects , and chargino - neutralino coannihilations . in every model that is cosmologically allowed ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is a cold relic from the big bang .",
    "being a cold relic , we expect that it is attracted into the gravitational potentials of galaxies , and is at present a component of the cold dark halo .",
    "we use the simple estimate that the dark matter density of the galactic halo at the position of the solar system is 0.3 gev @xmath42 .",
    "neutralinos may make up the entire halo or only some fraction @xmath43 .",
    "this fraction @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the cosmological density of species @xmath46 measured in units of the critical density .",
    "we now need an estimate of @xmath47 .",
    "a common prescription @xcite is to take @xmath48 if @xmath49 , which is the value indicated by dynamical mass measurements of the amount of dark matter in galactic halos . if @xmath50 , this prescription sets @xmath51 .",
    "this procedure is not conservative enough for our purposes because there may be more than one cold dark matter component in the galactic halo .",
    "therefore , we use the constraint that @xmath52 , based on the age of the universe @xcite , to give a lower bound on @xmath53 . in this way",
    "we obtain a conservative limit on the r - parity violating couplings .",
    "this may be overly conservative , and indeed our final results would improve by approximately a factor of five if we used the less conservative fraction .",
    "we consider neutralino decay through both the lepton - number violating term @xmath54 and the baryon - number violating term @xmath55 in the superpotential .",

    "@xcite provide a formalism for calculating hadron spectra from parton spectra in the modified double - logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) .",
    "the full mlla formula for inclusive particle production is too difficult to evaluate , and no numerical expression is available .",
    "it has been shown that the simpler limiting spectrum reproduces the total charged particle spectrum quite well @xcite . however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar ] , neither the limiting spectrum ( long - dashed curves  @xcite ) nor the low energy limit of the full mlla spectrum ( short - dashed curves  @xcite ) fit data for protons in a satisfactory manner . as a theoretical alternative to the mlla formalism , the lund monte carlo  @xcite has been used by several authors , most recently by bottino et al .",
    "however , it also does not match the data for protons satisfactorily ( histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbar ] ) .    inspecting the experimental data and the results of the lund monte carlo , we observe that the ( anti)proton production rate in the high - energy tail of the spectrum increases with jet energy .",
    "this is verified in the data for charged particle production in jets and is a generic prediction of the mlla formalism @xcite .",
    "based on these arguments , we decide to take the value @xmath75 at the momentum @xmath76 gev in which we want the antiproton spectra ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] ) .",
    "this underestimates the production rate of antiprotons , and gives a conservative bound on the r - parity violating couplings .",

    "the top decays before it can hadronize .",
    "we approximate the process @xmath78 using the fact that the low energy proton spectrum is insensitive to the jet energy .",
    "the bottom quark forms a jet .",
    "in addition , we take the hadronic branching fraction of the @xmath79 , @xmath80 , as the probability to form two additional jets in the decay @xmath81 and its charge conjugate .",
    "the final values for @xmath77 are 3 for a @xmath82 decay without top , 4.358 for a @xmath82 with top , 2 for an @xmath83 without top and 3.358 for an @xmath83 with top .",
    "we now obtain the volume production rate of antiprotons by multiplying the flat antiproton spectrum by the number density of neutralinos @xmath84 and the number of jets per decay @xmath77 , and dividing by the lifetime @xmath85 , @xmath86",

    "_ @xcite to describe diffusion of antiprotons through the galaxy .",
    "the flux of antiprotons at the outer solar system is approximated by multiplying the source spectrum by the antiproton velocity and an appropriate diffusion time .",

    "@xmath88 the region of turbulent magnetic fields responsible for diffusion can be approximated as a cylinder about 20kpc in radius and 2kpc high .",
    "this gives a diffusion time for antiprotons of @xmath89 the flux at the outer solar system beyond the influence of the solar wind is now given by @xmath90 this flux is in units of antiprotons s@xmath91 @xmath92 gev@xmath91 sr@xmath91 .",

    "this gives the highest inner solar system flux , thus the conservative bound on the couplings .    the solar modulated flux is now given by @xmath100",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "we choose a data point for the @xmath101 flux at the earth @xcite .",
    "these data have large error bars , but will improve with the next generation of experiments to be done in space @xcite . according to the data from bess , at an energy of 1.4 gev",

    "this is the energy at which we evaluate the diffusion time @xmath104 and the velocity @xmath105 .",
    "we now insist that the flux of antiprotons from neutralino decays be less than the observed flux . including corrections due to solar modulation , the statement is @xmath106    we choose not to make a correction for the spallation production of antiprotons .",
    "the data are consistent with the picture that all cosmic ray antiprotons are made in spallation reactions , but there are a lot of uncertainties .",
    "there is no good model for the amount we should subtract , and we have chosen to ignore it . we thus obtain a conservative bound on the couplings .    using the data we have chosen ,",
    "we obtain a model independent bound on the lifetime of a hadronically decaying relic with mass @xmath107 gev @xmath108 where we choose the mass fraction of neutralinos in the galactic dark halo as @xmath109 . since we assume that the neutralino is in the galactic halo at present , this bound applies for lifetimes longer than the age of the universe @xmath110 . in other words , we can exclude lifetimes in the range @xmath111 provided @xmath112 .    for these long lifetimes ,",
    "our bounds are in general better than those from diffuse photons @xcite , @xmath113 , and diffuse neutrinos @xcite , @xmath114 , except for some supersymmetric models with neutralino masses in the tev range .",

    "we find for the excluded range that @xmath125 if we would further demand that the neutralino be cosmologically interesting , namely @xmath126 , we would expand the excluded range to @xmath127 .",
    "we have plotted the upper bound on @xmath128 as a function of the neutralino mass for 10@xmath129 supersymmetric models in figure  [ fig : llmx ] .",
    "the results are similar for all generations in the r - parity violating couplings , except for @xmath130 which shows the top quark threshold ( see figure   [ fig : lltop ] ) .",
    "when the neutralino is lighter than the top quark , there is no bound on @xmath130 at tree level .",
    "a bound can however be found at the one loop level @xcite .    in our sample of supersymmetric models , we find the absolute upper limits @xmath131 is due to our neglect of one - loop diagrams .",
    "these upper limits depend on the neutralino mass , and improve considerably with higher masses .",
    "we find the following power law fits @xmath132    for comparison , the most stringent laboratory constraints , those from proton decay  @xcite , bound not @xmath133 and @xmath134 separately but their product to @xmath135 , where @xmath26 is the sfermion mass scale .",
    "these bounds are six orders of magnitude weaker than ours . on the other hand , because our analysis only applies to lifetimes longer than the age of the universe , our excluded region spans only 3 orders of magnitude .",
