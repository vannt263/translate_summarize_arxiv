    "particle acceleration is an ubiquitous feature in many classes of astrophysical objects , such as active galactic nuclei , gamma - ray bursts , pulsars . despite several physical processes",
    "are know to be responsible for accelerating particles under different conditions , radiative acceleration has special importance .",
    "@xcite were the first to study the acceleration of charged particles caused by scattering off a radiation beam .",
    "they derived the relativistic equation of motion for the electrons and assumed that the radiative force is applied directly to the electron - ion assembly .",
    "for the typical radiative fluxes produced in type ii supernovae , they found that ions may acquire energies of the order of their rest mass energy .",
    "radiative acceleration was the subject of several further investigations in the 80s , mainly connected with the possibility that this mechanism could drive relativistic collimated outflows , or jets , such as those observed in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and in some galactic sources ( e.g. ss433 ) .",
    "earlier studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) dealt with the radiative acceleration of electrons assuming thomson scattering in the particle frame and adopting a test - particle approach .",
    "this is fully justified when the medium is optically thin ( for a discussion of the optically thick case see @xcite ) and allowed to clarify the role of compton drag in establishing the limiting plasma velocity and the dynamical effects caused by anisotropic compton losses of plasma internal energy ( `` compton rocket '' ) .",
    "the first calculation of the radiative force acting on electrons taking into account the klein - nishina cross section was performed by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite re - addressed the issue of the dynamics of a cold plasma subject to an external radiation field in the klein - nishina regime . in a companion paper @xcite ,",
    "the feedback of pair creation on radiative acceleration was also considered .",
    "contrary to earlier works , the main focus of these investigations is on the dynamics of the fireball expected to energize gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in such a scenario , the mean photon energy is large enough to give raise to copious pair production .",
    "an interesting and related research thread is the acceleration by electrostatic fields generated by space charge separation .",
    "@xcite considered a mechanism suitable for positron acceleration in accreting neutron stars .",
    "he proposed that the radiation field incident on the plasma acts differently on electrons and ions because of the large difference in mass and cross section ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "electrons are separated from ions and an electrostatic field arises to restore charge neutrality .",
    "the net electrostatic potential is able to accelerate positrons , which are limited by pair production and inverse compton , but reach energies of tens of mev .",
    "the calculation has been revised by @xcite , who found that the maximum energy attainable is limited to @xmath5 400 kev . @xcite",
    "and @xcite investigated this scenario in connection with the vacuum breakdown near an accreting black hole , while @xcite studied the case of a supermassive black hole in an agn .",
    "@xcite proposed another version , consisting of infalling blobs of plasma onto a neutron star , in which the electric field is generated by the co - rotation of the strong magnetic field of the star ( cfr .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism has also several applications to particle acceleration in solar flares and planetary bow shocks ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a complete analysis of the acceleration of electrons and ions by electrostatic potential fields that arise in a low density plasma illuminated by a burst of radiation . extending previous works ( in particular that by @xcite ) , the dynamical evolution of the charged particles under the joint action of the internal electrostatic and the external radiation forces is investigated . in   2 we derive the non - relativistic and relativistic equations of motion for the charged plasma particles in presence of a double layer .",
    "our results are presented in  3 and thoroughly discussed in  4 .",
    "conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "in a plasma , any slight deviation from a condition of global electric neutrality gives rise to large restoring forces .",
    "radiation impinging on a plasma acts differently on ions and electrons , because of their large difference in mass , generating a space charge separation .",
    "therefore , an electric field rises to restore global neutrality .",
    "since the resulting electric field is across two opposite space charge layers , it is often called `` double layer '' ( dl ) , particularly with reference to studies in interplanetary bow shocks and solar flares ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    consider a transient , compact source of high energy photons of luminosity @xmath6 surrounded by an optically thin shell of cold plasma .",
    "the plasma is composed of electrons and completely ionized ions of atomic number @xmath7 .",
    "the radiation flux is sufficiently strong that gravity can be neglected and , at the typical distances from the central source considered here , magnetic fields are assumed to be dynamically unimportant .",
    "the equations of motion of the electrons and ions ( in a reference frame @xmath8 at rest with respect to the central source ) under the joint action of the radiative force and the restoring force of the dl are @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lorentz factor , 3-velocity and mass of electrons and ions , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spatial components of the radiative and electric 4-forces acting on electrons and ions . the radiative force acting on the ions",
    "is neglected because it is a factor @xmath16 smaller than that on the electrons .",
    "here we consider mono - energetic particles .",
    "if the charged particles have a momentum distribution , the previous equations must be averaged over the normalized phase - space density @xmath17 .",
    "we checked a posteriori that the radiation - reaction force due to the energy radiated by the accelerated particles is negligible and does not influence the dynamics .",

    "we will investigate radiative acceleration from an isotropic , spherically symmetric source of radiation .",
    "then , the motion of the charged particles is radial and the equations simplify to @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the radial components of the electron and ion velocities , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the radial components of the radiative and electric 4-forces acting on electrons and ions .",

    "if there are no external magnetic fields and the plasma particles move along the radial direction , the radial component of the electric field @xmath46 can be obtained from the gauss theorem . for a ( geometrically thin ) dl , we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the volume density of charged particles and @xmath54 is the displacement between the electron and ion positions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we checked a posteriori that the condition @xmath57 is satisfied .",
    "the newtonian equations for the radial motion of the electrons and ions under the joint action of the radiative force and the restoring force of the dl can be obtained from equations  ( [ e : eqrad1])([e : frad ] ) neglecting terms @xmath58 .",

    "the system is a coupled oscillator with a driving force ( radiation ) .",
    "when the radiation flash hits the plasma shell , electrons are pushed outwards and begin to oscillate . because of the restoring force of the dl , ions are dragged by the electrons .",
    "the whole system oscillates essentially at the electron plasma frequency ( @xmath113 ) and is accelerated outwards .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations of the ions is a factor @xmath114 smaller than that of the electrons . from equation  ( [ e : sol1 ] ) , it is easy to see that the mean acceleration imparted to the whole system by the radiation force is @xmath115 , as one could expect .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation of the electrons relative to the ions is @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the average electric field of the dl is @xmath117 . in the non - relativistic limit , the velocity of the charged particles and the dl electric field increase linearly with @xmath108 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the numerical solution of the relativistic equations ( eqs .",

    "the energy of the input monochromatic radiation spectrum is @xmath121 , sufficiently low that the klein - nishina correction to the scattering force is negligible . during the early evolution ,",
    "the essential properties of the non - relativistic solution are recognizable . however , after a few plasma time - scales , oscillations are significantly damped .",
    "in fact , in the relativistic equations ( e.g. eqs .  [ [ e : rel1 ] ] and  [ [ e : rel2 ] ] ) the radiative term contains a dependence on the electron velocity @xmath122 that gives rise to a force formally similar to a `` viscous '' force .",
    "however , this is not a physical drag exerted by the radiation field onto the electrons because , by assumption , photons are streaming radially .",
    "this effect is simply a consequence of the lorentz transformation for the radiation moments .",
    "in fact , the radiative flux measured in the comoving frame varies with respect to that measured in the system frame according to equation  ( [ e : flusso ] ) . in radial streaming , the term @xmath123 becomes @xmath124 .",
    "this accounts for the decrease ( or increase ) in the flux measured in the comoving frame caused by the electron motion and , ultimately , originates from the finite velocity of propagation of photons .",
    "this effect is already important at fairly modest electron speeds and , when @xmath125 , the decrease of the radiative flux makes radiative acceleration less efficient .",
    "the change in the sign of @xmath122 induced by the plasma oscillations causes a decrease / increase of the radiative force ( as seen in the comoving frame ) that produces the same effect of a viscous force , damping the oscillations of the electrons on a few characteristic plasma time - scales ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] )    for @xmath126  cm , the system approaches the truly relativistic regime . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , during the initial transient phase , the radiative force is so strong that electrons are accelerated rapidly to relativistic speeds while the ions lag behind owing to their larger inertia .",
    "this produces an electric restoring force that accelerates the ions for all the duration of the burst .",
    "oscillations are completely damped . for a short duration flash ,",
    "the final speeds and energies of the charged particles are rather modest . however , as shown in fig .",

    "the dl has already moved significantly from the initial position ( @xmath131 cm ) and the lorentz factor has become so large that the radiative flux in the comoving frame becomes negligible .",
    "radiative acceleration is no longer very efficient and electrons and ions are almost freely streaming , with the electrons oscillating around the ions ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic large amplitude oscillations achieved by the electrons may give rise to strong internal dissipation , thereby increasing the plasma temperature .",
    "models with @xmath132 cm suffer , however , from two major limitations .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath133  cm , the luminosity exceeds @xmath134  erg s@xmath119 and the effective temperature of the radiation is @xmath135  k for a typical source size @xmath136  cm .",
    "the mean photon energy is then sufficiently large that the klein - nishina correction to the radiative force ( see eq.[[e : fradrels ] ] ) starts to become significant .",
    "this is a fortiori true if the primary photon spectrum has a significant high - energy component .",
    "an example of the particles dynamics in this regime is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for monochromatic input photons with @xmath137 .",
    "as expected , the main effect of the reduction in the effective cross - section is to lower the terminal lorentz factor of both ions and electrons , but this does not change the essential features of the acceleration process discussed above .",
    "the second issue concerns the possibility that the wind may become pair - loaded as a consequence of @xmath138 interactions among primary photons or between primary and once - scattered photons .",
    "this effect is bound to increase dramatically the efficiency of radiative acceleration because it reduces the inertia of the plasma , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "charge - separation in a pair - dominated medium is outside the scope of the present investigation , so in the following we restrict to cases with photon energies well below the threshold for pair production . for thermal radiation with effective temperature @xmath139 k , the fraction of photons with energy two times larger than the threshold energy ( @xmath140 mev , at which the cross section for pair - production peaks ) is @xmath141 .",
    "the luminosity from a source of characteristic size @xmath142 cm is @xmath143 erg s@xmath119 , corresponding to @xmath144 cm for @xmath111 cm .",
    "the optical depth for @xmath138 interaction between two primary photons close to the source is @xmath145 , where @xmath146 for large scattering angles and @xmath147 for a burst of duration @xmath148 .",
    "although @xmath149 would be lower for beamed or anisotropic emission , close to an isotropic source it is much larger than unity and all photons above threshold can produce @xmath150 pairs .",
    "however , for @xmath151 k , there are no photons with energy two times larger than the threshold energy ( @xmath152 ) and hence the radiation field is pair - free . as for the photons scattered in an off - radial direction by the plasma electrons at radius @xmath61 ,",
    "their optical depth to primary photons is @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the scattering probability .",
    "the value of @xmath155 can be larger or smaller than unity , depending on the plasma density .",
    "but , even if @xmath156 , for @xmath151 k no additional pair - loading is induced because there are no primary photons above threshold and once - scattered photons did not gain appreciable energy in the scattering .",
    "therefore , for @xmath157 cm the dynamics of the plasma shells is not influenced by pair - loading .",
    "for these values of the parameter @xmath108 , the probability that once - scattered photons collide with another electron is actually larger than undergoing @xmath138 interaction .",
    "if at the time of the second scattering event the electron has already acquired relativistic velocity , in the electron rest frame the energy of the scattered photon is boosted by a factor @xmath158 .",
    "so , if @xmath159 is the probability of the first scattering , the probability that a photon undergoes two scatterings is @xmath160 ( owing to the decrease in the klein - nishina cross section ) .",
    "then , the number of twice scattered photons for a @xmath161 s burst is @xmath162 . in order not to influence significantly the dynamics of the plasma shells ,",
    "this number must be smaller than @xmath163 , which implies @xmath164 @xmath3 for @xmath165 cm . for plasma densities in excess of @xmath166 @xmath3 ,",
    "the dynamics of the plasma shells starts to be significantly influenced by compton up - scattering of off - radial photons ( compton drag ) .",
    "twice - scattered photons are boosted to very large energies .",
    "energy conservation limits their maximum energy to @xmath167 mev , corresponding to a the total luminosity @xmath168 erg s@xmath119 .",
    "compton drag caused by off - radial primary photons may also play an important role in the vicinity of the source . in order to understand qualitatively this effect",
    ", we solved the equations assuming a slight deviation of the radiation field from the perfect radial case ( of the order of @xmath169 ) .",
    "the solution is shown in figure  [ fig9 ] where , in order to avoid the regime of pair - loading , @xmath170  cm .",
    "compton drag decreases the electron lorentz factor attainable during the electrostatic ion acceleration stage .",
    "therefore , once the ions have been accelerated to relativistic energies by the radiation - induced dl electric field , they overtake the electrons and the dl reverses . at this stage",
    "the electrons are re - accelerated at the expense of the electrostatic potential energy of the dl and , ultimately , of the kinetic energy of the ions .",
    "the asymptotic lorentz factors of ions and electrons are about 10 times smaller than those achieved for a perfectly radial radiation field ( point source ) .",
    "placing the plasma shell closer to the central source would end up in a sufficient deviation from radial streaming to cause too a large decrease of the overall efficiency of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "we note that , even if the plasma is initially cold , random internal energy will be imparted to the electrons by the incident hard - x and gamma - rays , because direct energy and momentum transfer results when outward - directed photons are removed from nearly radially streaming radiation field and scattered away . in principle , if a sufficient amount of internal energy is transferred to the electron plasma , it can be effectively converted into bulk motion through the so - called `` compton rocket '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this way ,",
    "the energy lost to heat may be compensated by that gained by the electrons thanks to the additional compton thrust .",
    "although the study of this regime is beyond the scope of the present investigation , the outcome of the electron acceleration process with the additional compton thrust may not be qualitatively different with respect to what found here .",
    "the radiation - induced electrostatic acceleration of the plasma shells is effective if they are quite spatially concentrated and overdense with respect to the surrounding medium . in fact , if the shells are spatially extended , the escaping radiation would accelerate the plasma located at larger and larger radii at progressively lower speeds .",
    "the innermost , high velocity dls would rapidly overtake the outer , low velocity ones , producing shocks and dissipation of kinetic energy into heat .",
    "it is noteworthy that , for intense radiation fluxes ( @xmath171  cm ) , the asymptotic energies achieved by both ions and electrons are larger by a factor 24 ( depending on the burst duration , see fig.[fig9 ] ) with respect to what one could naively expect assuming that the electron - ion system was rigidly coupled with a total mass ( @xmath172 ) and electron scattering cross section @xmath173 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the radiative force is not conservative and hence the dynamical evolution of the system is of fundamental importance in determining the asymptotic energies .",
    "thanks to the prompt response of the electrons , the work done by the radiation field is accumulated in the dl and is later effectively converted into kinetic energy of the ions through the acceleration produced by the dl electric field . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , this process is significantly more effective than radiatively accelerating a rigidly coupled electron - ion system .",
    "in fact , ions become relativistic at @xmath174 and are electrostatically accelerated to large lorentz factors up to @xmath175 , when they catch up with the electrons . in the interval @xmath176 , the average velocity of the electrons is smaller then that of a rigidly coupled system and hence the radiative force is more effective .",
    "the net work done by the radiation field is 24 times larger than it would otherwise be and is stored in the dl as electrostatic potential energy .",
    "the maximum electric field and energy can be estimated assuming that , initially ( @xmath177 ) , the electrons travel at the speed of light while the motion of the ions is approximately non - relativistic .",
    "then , @xmath178 and @xmath179 . integrating this equation with @xmath180 and @xmath181",
    ", we can calculate the time @xmath182 at which @xmath183 and the separation @xmath184 at @xmath182 .",
    "it is : @xmath185 and @xmath186 cm . substituting these expressions in equation  ( [ e : campoel ] ) , we obtain @xmath187 in quite good agreement with the maximum electric field reported in fig .",
    "the distance traveled by the ions during the relativistic acceleration phase ( @xmath188 ) is @xmath189 and then their asymptotic energy is approximately given by @xmath190 ev .    despite the large asymptotic energies achieved by ions and electrons , the overall efficiency of this process is very low .",
    "the final energy acquired by an ion is @xmath191 erg . comparing this energy with the total work done by the radiation field on @xmath7 electrons , @xmath192 erg , we find that the efficiency is not larger than @xmath193 .",
    "we have shown that radiation - induced electric fields can increase significantly the terminal energy of a ion - electron plasma accelerated by a transient radiation source .",
    "the asymptotic lorentz factors are a factor 24 larger than those attainable by radiative acceleration alone .",
    "the effect is maximum when both radiation drag and @xmath138 interactions are negligible , i.e. when the central source is distant ( @xmath194 ) or beamed , the plasma density is low ( @xmath164 @xmath3 ) and the average photon energy is well below the threshold for pair production ( @xmath195 k ) . for @xmath196 cm",
    ", these limitations imply @xmath197 erg s@xmath119 , or @xmath144  cm . decreasing / increasing the initial position of the plasma shell by an order of magnitude results in a corresponding decrement / increment of the maximum allowed luminosity ( @xmath198 erg s@xmath119 and @xmath199 erg s@xmath119 , respectively ) .",
    "however , because @xmath108 remains the same and , for a fixed duration burst , is proportional to the total work done by the radiation field on the ion - electron assembly , the dynamics and terminal energy are similar in all these cases .",
    "although direct astrophysical applications are outside the scope of the present investigation , it is quite interesting to note that giant flares from soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are typically within the parameter range considered here .",
    "the total energy emitted in two giant flares observed from sgr 0525 - 66 and sgr 1900 + 14 was @xmath200 on a timescale @xmath201  s , with an implied luminosity of about the same order ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . in the picture proposed by @xcite",
    "the giant flare is produced by a large - scale instability of the neutron star magnetic field which leads to the formation of an expanding pair fireball .",
    "the radiative acceleration process presented in this paper has no direct connection with the dynamics of the baryon - sheathed pair fireball , whose characteristic size is @xmath202  cm .",
    "however , it is possible that the outflowing radiation front impinges on a low - density ordinary plasma at much larger distances , @xmath203  cm , accelerating protons and electrons to relativistic velocities as illustrated e.g. in fig .",

    "<S> we calculate the dynamical evolution and asymptotic energy of the charged particles accelerated by the photons and the radiation - induced electric double layer in the full relativistic , klein - nishina regime . for fluxes in excess of @xmath0 @xmath1 , the radiative force on a diluted plasma ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> is so strong that electrons are accelerated rapidly to relativistic speeds while ions lag behind owing to their larger inertia . </S>",
    "<S> the ions are later effectively accelerated by the strong radiation - induced double layer electric field up to lorentz factors @xmath4 , attainable in the case of negligible compton drag . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic energies achieved by both ions and electrons are larger by a factor 24 with respect to what one could naively expect assuming that the electron - ion assembly is a rigidly coupled system . </S>",
    "<S> the regime we investigate may be relevant within the framework of giant flares from soft gamma - repeaters . </S>"
