    "compact accreting x - ray sources in nearby galaxies with luminosities exceeding 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath12 are referred to as ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "current evidence suggests that ulxs might be a mixed bag of compact objects including stellar - mass black holes ( stmbhs : 3 - 25 @xmath9 ) powered by super - eddington accretion ( e.g. , king et al .",

    "2015 ) , and neutron stars ( bachetti et al . 2014 ) .",
    "one of the biggest challenges in understanding ulxs is to estimate their compact object masses . because their optical counterparts are faint ( v - band magnitudes of 22 - 24 ; e.g. , gladstone et al . 2013 ,",
    "tao et al . 2011 ) , doppler tracking their optical counterparts to derive their mass functions  as done for galactic stmbhs  has been extremely challenging ( e.g. , roberts et al . 2011 , cseh et al . 2013 ) .",
    "however , in a few ulxs , such optical measurements have yielded mass constraints that suggest lower - mass black holes ( @xmath13 30 @xmath9 ; liu et al .",
    "2013 , motch et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the detection of the 3:2 frequency ratio high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) can resolve the ulx mass problem ( abramowicz et al .",
    "stmbh high - frequency qpos ( frequency range of 100 - 450 hz ; mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) that appear in a 3:2 frequency ratio scale inversely with the black hole mass .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the power density spectra ( pds ) of both the stellar - mass and the supermassive black holes are qualitatively similar .",
    "the pds break timescale of both simply scale with the black hole mass , after accounting for the differences in the accretion efficiency between sources ( e.g. , mchardy et al .",
    "2006 , krding et al .",
    "one can also use this break timescale to estimate black hole masses .",
    "thus , under this black hole variability unification paradigm , 3:2 high - frequency qpo analogs of stmbhs should also be detectable from imbhs , but with centroid frequencies scaled down according to their respective black hole masses ( vaughan & uttley 2005 ) .",
    "for example , a few 1000 @xmath9 imbh should exhibit high - frequency qpos with centroid frequencies in the range of a fraction of hz .",
    "in fact , such a 3:2 ratio qpos have already been detected from the ulx m82 x-1 . in that source ,",
    "the two qpos ( 3.3 and 5 hz ) allowed pasham et al .",

    "as of the writing of this paper , 22 of the 24 _ xmm - newton _ observations of ngc 1313 are public .",
    "the three brightest x - ray sources in this field , the two ulxs , ngc 1313 x-1 ( hereafter , x-1 ) , x-2 and the x - ray bright supernova sn1978k are well separated in the xmm images ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "previous energy spectral studies of x-1 suggest it may host an imbh with a mass of @xmath8 1000 @xmath9 ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2003 , 2013 ) . given the frequency range we are interested in , we used data primarily from epic - pn , utilizing events in the entire 0.3 - 10.0 kev band pass .",
    "both the pn and the mos detectors were operated in the so - called full - frame mode during all the observations . while pn s full - frame data mode offers a time resolution of 73.4 ms , i.e. , nyquist frequency of 6.82 hz , mos data is limited to a nyquist frequency of only 0.19 hz .",
    "we reduced all the observations using the standard data reduction procedures and removed datasets that were severely affected by background flaring .",
    "this preliminary screening left us with fifteen observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "source events were extracted from a circular region of radius 33@xmath14 ( dashed circle around x-1 in figure 1 ) when x-1 was clear of a ccd gap . when x-1 was close to or on a ccd gap we extracted events from a smaller region of radius 25@xmath14 excluding the ccd gap .",
    "circular background regions of the same radius , and free of any point sources , were chosen away from the source s readout column and as close to the telescope pointing as possible .      in order to assess x-1 s variability , we first extracted the source and the background light curves from each of the fifteen observations .",
    "background flaring was prominent for only brief durations in some observations .",
    "we constructed good time intervals ( gtis ) accounting for both the background flares and times when the detector was turned off .",
    "figure 2 contains sample background - subtracted x - ray light curves ( black ) and their respective backgrounds ( red ) from all the observations whose power spectra are described in this article .    using the gtis shown in figure 2",
    ", we constructed a leahy normalized ( poisson noise level of 2 ; leahy 1983 ) pds of x-1 from each of the individual observations .",
    "all the power spectra were sampled only up to 4 hz , a value safely below the nyquist frequency of 6.82 hz , in order to avoid any aliasing affects .",
    "we started our timing analysis with the three longest observations ( obsids : 0405090101 , 0693850501 , and 0693851201 ) during which x-1 was positioned on - axis , giving the best sensitivity for detecting qpos .",
    "the top panel of figure 3 shows the combined epic ( pn+mos ) pds from obsid 0405090101sampled in the frequency range from 0.0022 to 4 hz .",
    "we first extracted a pn - only pds and found a qpo - like feature at 80 mhz , a frequency well below the mos detectors nyquist frequency .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the signal , we used pn+mos data in this single instance .",
    "it is evident that the overall shape of the power spectrum is flat - topped at the lowest frequencies , breaking into a power - law , and white noise at the highest frequencies .",
    "two broad , qpo features at centroid frequencies of roughly 30 and 80 mhz are also apparent .",

( 2002 ) pointed out the problems with applying the f - test in additive models .",

    "\\3 ) after binning these pds in the same way as the original pds , we modeled them with a bending power law .",
    "we then added a qpo to this model , with the qpo frequency constrained to lie between 0.01 and 1 hz .",

    "\\4 ) the significance of the 80 mhz qpo was estimated as 1 - @xmath23/@xmath19 , where @xmath23 is the number of simulated @xmath24 values greater than the observed @xmath25 . for estimating the significance of the 30 mhz qpo",
    ", we assumed the baseline model to be the best - fit continuum plus 80 mhz qpo of the observed pds , and recorded the maximum @xmath26 values by adding an additional qpo to this base model .",
    "this methodology is similar to estimating the significances of spectral lines in energy spectra ( e.g. , tombesi et al .",

    "the maximum @xmath26 was 25 , which is much lower than the observed value of 89 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the 80 mhz feature is significant at least at the 5@xmath6 level .",
    "we ran 200,000 simulations to test the significance of the 30 mhz feature and found that one run exceeded the observed @xmath26 of 40 .",

    "the pds from observation 0693850501 exhibited a strong feature at roughly 0.3 hz ( bottom - left panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "the continuum looks flat because we only sampled up to roughly 0.02 hz .",
    "a flat - topped , followed by a power - law like continuum can be seen when we sample up to 0.001 hz using longer light curve segments .",
    "modeling the continuum with a constant yielded a best - fit @xmath16 of 186 for 127 dof . adding a lorentzian component improved the @xmath16 by 56 with an addition of three parameters ( @xmath16 of 130 for 124 dof ) .",

    "out of the 1.8@xmath210@xmath20 simulations , the maximum @xmath26 improvement was 27 , a value much less than the observed @xmath26 improvement of 56 .",
    "the best - fit centroid frequency , width , normalization and the rms of the qpo were 0.29@xmath40.01 hz , 0.13@xmath40.04 hz , 0.14@xmath40.03 , and 19.0@xmath45.0% , respectively .",
    "we also estimated the significance using another independent method .",
    "first we rescaled the pds ( rescaling factor of 1.01 , and the rescaled power at 0.29 hz  in the highest bin  is 2.173 ) so that the local mean around 0.5 hz is equal to 2 , the value expected from a purely poisson ( white noise ) process .",

    "the confidence contours are marked by horizontal dotted lines in the bottom - left panel of figure 3 .",
    "clearly , the highest bin in the 0.3 hz qpo is significant at greater than the 4@xmath6 level .    after establishing the lower - frequency continuum and qpos , and the 0.3 hz qpo",
