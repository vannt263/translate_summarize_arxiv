    "quasi - one - dimensional  ( q1d ) colloidal systems play an increasingly important role as model systems to study a variety of collective phenomena in low dimensional condensed matter physics .",
    "the well - controlled way in real space and time , and the tunable interparticle interaction potential of colloidal systems lead to insights of a wide range of systems .",
    "most of the studies on q1d colloidal systems focused on stripe structures and crystal defects  @xcite , solid - liquid phase transitions  @xcite , single - file diffusion  @xcite and transport behavior under external driving force  @xcite , including , e.g. , dragged particles  @xcite .",
    "transport properties of colloidal particles driven by an external force in narrow channels became a growing topic during the last decade .",
    "this is by part because the transport behavior might provide a deeper understanding of several biological systems , e.g. , ion - channel transport in cell membranes  @xcite , dna manipulations and separations  @xcite .",
    "also it is a readily available physical model to mimic other types of particles , including different ions and electrons , which might lead to practical use in microdevices and nanodevices  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the transport behaviors are important in real systems of medicine , food production and field - response materials as well .",
    "there are also studies of transport properties of particles which are driven in other shapes of patterned environments  @xcite .    in nature and technology",
    ", many systems are mixtures of different particle types .",
    "the distinction and interaction , mixture and separation of each particle type give rise to an exceedingly rich phenomenology as compared to monodisperse systems .",
    "this motivited a number of studies on complex mixtures and , in particular , binary mixtures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the fundamental problems related to binary mixtures is their separation ( see , e.g. ,   @xcite ) .",
    "this problem is commonly tackled by using different asymmetric potentials for separating , e.g. , interacting binary mixtures driven on periodic substrates   @xcite ) . or ferrofluids  @xcite .",
    "mixtures of particles can be driven either along the symmetry axis of the potentials , or in the transverse direction  @xcite which was demonstrated in the context of separation of macromolecules , dna , or even cells ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "note that in the previous studies a driving force ( e.g. , gravity  @xcite or external field  @xcite ) was applied to _ all _ the particles of the system ( or to one of the species ) , and the separation occurred either due to the different dynamic response of the species to the driving / potentials or due to their different self - diffusion constant .",
    "in contrast to that , here we propose a new mechanism of particle separation .",
    "it is based on injecting special particles which are able to move in the binary mixture and interact with its species .",
    "these can be either particles driven by external forces ( which describes a typical situation in microrheology  @xcite ) or _ self - driven _",
    "particles i.e. , driven by various self - phoretic forces produced by a chemical ( self - chemophoresis ) ( see , e.g. , the recent review paper  @xcite ) , electrical ( self - electrophoresis ) or thermal ( self - thermophoresis ) gradient that the particle generates around itself ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , so - called janus particles ( @xmath0m - sized particles covered by gold on one of the hemispheres ) can move ( `` swim '' ) when being illuminated by light ( details of the mechanism of motion of these artificial `` microswimmers '' ( ms ) are beyond the scope of this work and can be found in  @xcite ) . due to their amphliphilicity , janus particles",
    "are extensively studied as a model of structure - directing amphiphiles ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and in relation to their applications in new functional materials ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . here",
    "we demonstrate that artificial ms , when moving in a binary mixture , are capable of _ selectively driving _ and separating the flows of different species of the binary mixture .",
    "we consider a binary system of paramagnetic colloidal particles confined in a 2d infinitely long narrow hard - wall channel in an external perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the particles ( including the microswimmer  for experimental realization of paramagnetic microswimmers see refs .",
    "@xcite ) interact via a repulsive dipole - dipole potential ( see , e.g. , experiments  @xcite ) @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the `` effective charge '' , @xmath3 is the magnetic moment , and @xmath4 is the coordinate of the @xmath5-th particle ; @xmath6 is the magnetic permittivity .",
    "we assume that there are two types of particles , a and b , which differ by size and charge .",
    "we call them `` small '' ( a ) and `` big '' ( b ) particles .",
    "the system consists of @xmath7 small particles with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 big particles with @xmath10 .",
    "the effective charge of self - driven ms is chosen @xmath11 .",
    "we introduce a unit energy @xmath12 of the inter - particle interaction @xmath13 , where the unit length @xmath14  @xmath15 is on the order of the average distance between particles  @xcite .",
    "thus the inter - particle interaction can be characterized by the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 the ambient temperature . in our simulations , we choose @xmath19 which corresponds to the strongly correlated regime , i.e. , below the melting transition .",
    "correspondingly , the unit force is @xmath20 . for the chosen @xmath19 and room temperature ,",
    "@xmath21  n.    the motion of colloidal particles is investigated using the langevin equations of motion in the overdamped regime , i.e. , the brownian dynamics  ( bd ) method .",
    "this approach neglects hydrodynamic interactions as well as the short - time momentum relaxation of the particles ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the overdamped equations of motion of particles are : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the self - diffusion coefficient , which is chosen as @xmath24  @xmath25 for type a ( and for ms ) and @xmath26  @xmath25 for type b particles , according to the experiment  @xcite .",
    "the first term of the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ bd ] ) is the sum of all repulsive interaction forces acting on each particle , the second term is the `` self - driving force '' acting _ only _ on the ms ( or `` motor '' particle  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , a similar approach has been used for the description of motion of swimming bacteria and self - driven particles  @xcite . note that force @xmath27 entering into the langevin equation ( [ bd ] ) is an effective force which describes the propulsion mechanism on average ( see , e.g. , the recent studies  @xcite on the brownian motion of a self - propelled particle ) . in experiment , this effective `` driving force '' can be tuned by , e.g. , changing the intensity of the incident light ( in case of janus particles ) , the geometry of the experiment  @xcite , or the number of ms particles , etc . ;",
    "we do not discuss here the relation between @xmath27 and those parameters .",
    "furthermore , without loss of generality we consider here only the @xmath28-component of @xmath29 .",
    "this is justified by the fact that the ( average ) _ direction _ of motion of a ms ( i.e. , a janus particle illuminated by light ) can be controlled by , e.g. , direction of the incident light and by using different illumination patterns  @xcite , or by additionally applied drift force  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in our case the motion of a ms across the channel is restricted by the boundaries . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore rotational motion of a ms  @xcite .",
    "the last term is the thermal random force that obeys the following conditions : @xmath30 and @xmath31    as a simulation cell , we use a unit box of length @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and width @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) ( the box dimensions are close to those in the experiments  @xcite )",
    ". periodic boundary conditions  ( pbc ) are imposed in the @xmath28 direction , and hard wall boundaries in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "we use a cutoff  ( @xmath37 ) for the dipole short - range inter - particle interaction .",
    "we also checked that by doubling the length of the simulation cell our results do not change .",

    "note that particles a ( small ) move _ faster _ than their counterpart . depending on @xmath48",
    ", we can distinguish four different regions ( shown in fig .",
    "[ vwithf](b ) as ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) ) .    _",
    "region ( 1 ) : rigid body motion",
    "_    this regime corresponds to very small @xmath48 when the system is in a `` rigid body '' motion , i.e. , velocities @xmath46 and @xmath47 coincide .",
    "the system is in a solid state ( @xmath19 ) , and only elastic deformations are present  @xcite .    _ region ( 2 ) : inverse velocity motion _    this regime is observed for small @xmath48 when the velocity of the ms is high enough to locally melt the solid , however , the velocites are inversed as compared to the broad region ( 3 ) , i.e. , particles a ( small ) move _ slower _ than particles b. this unusual behavior is explained by the stronger interaction of the ms with particles b than with particles a. as a consequence , particles b are carried along by the ms while the dynamical friction due to the particle motion is very small in this case and can be neglected .",
    "this regime is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ trajxdens0.4 ] .",
    "the snapshots ( figs .  [ trajxdens0.4](a - c ) ) show that the system adjusts itself to the slow `` swimming '' of the ms , without appreciable changes in the structure .",
    "however , the local density profile ( fig .  [ trajxdens0.4](d ) ) indicates that the local density of particles b in front of the moving ms is higher than that of particles a. this means that particles b ( big ) are carried along by the ms while particles a ( which interact weaker with the ms ) `` slip '' and thus move slower .    _",
    "region ( 3 ) : strong flow separation _    this regime is observed for a broad range of intermediate @xmath48 : this is the main and the most robust regime . with increasing velocity",
    ", the dynamical friction becomes increasingly important , and , as a result , type a particles ( which are characterized by a larger self - diffusion coefficient ) start to move faster .",
    "the function @xmath52 reaches its maximum at about @xmath53 and then gradually decreases while the function @xmath54 increases only slowly in this region and then decreases .",
    "it is worth noting that in this regime , the function @xmath54 first rapidly decreases .",
    "this decrease is accompanied by a simultaneous sharp increase in the function @xmath52 .",
    "the origin of this behavior is explained by the fact that the motion of the two species ( i.e. , particles a and b ) becomes less correlated as compared to that in regime ( 2 ) .",
    "this loss of correlation in motion of the different species resembles the transition from elastic to plastic motion .",
    "the observed splitting of the average velocities is similar to the splitting in the velocities of adjacent layers found in a `` vortex wigner solid ''  @xcite where the transition to plastic motion was induced by shear stress .",
    "the snapshots and the local density profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ trajxdens1.2 ] illustrate this regime .",
    "in contrast to regime ( 2 ) ( cp .",
    "[ trajxdens0.4 ] ) , the motion of the ms strongly influences the particle distribution : in particular , we observe a pronounced effect of particle separation in real space ( i.e. , not only in velocity space ) , or the formation of _ clusters _ of particles a which `` trap '' the ms and follow it ( see figs .  [ trajxdens1.2](b , c ) ) .",
    "the local density of particles a has a sharp peak in front of the ms ( fig .",
    "[ trajxdens1.2](d ) ) , due to the ms - induced compression of the particle configuration in front of the ms . at the same time , the particles behind the ms are relaxed resulting in no peak in the local density .",
    "_ region ( 4 ) : fast ms motion .",
    "_    this regime corresponds to large @xmath48 : finally , the system undergoes a transition to a `` quasi - rigid body '' regime when the ms moves too fast through the binary solid to produce a responce in form of flow separation .    in order to analyze the role of the width of the channel , we performed simulations for wider channels , and we found that the effect of separation remains qualitatively similar : for a broad range of @xmath55 , the average velocity of small particles , @xmath52 , is larger than that of large particles , @xmath54 .",
    "however , the more gentle effect of velocity inversion can disappear , depending on the concentration of the particles .",
    "the role of imbalance in properties of the particles is discussed in the next section .     and @xmath56 , which corresponds to regime ( 2 ) ( see fig .  1 ) of inverse velocities .",

    "above , we revealed the general features of the separation of the particle flows by the ms `` swimming '' in a binary mixture and explained the mechanisms of the observed effect for the different separation regimes .",
