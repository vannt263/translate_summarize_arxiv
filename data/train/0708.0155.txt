    "recently belle collaboration observed a new resonance @xmath4 in the decay @xmath5 . the resonance has the mass @xmath6 , width @xmath7 , and spin - parity @xmath8@xcite .",
    "they interpret the @xmath9 as a @xmath10 meson , the potential model calculations predict a radially excited @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) state with a mass about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the resonance @xmath4 is consistent with the particle they presented previously in the 33rd international conference on high energy physics ( ichep 06 ) , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and spin - parity @xmath15 @xcite . in the same analysis of the @xmath16 mass distribution ,",
    "babar collaboration observed a broad structure with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which maybe the same resonance observed by belle collaboration @xcite .    in this article , we take the point of view that the vector charmed meson @xmath4 be a tetraquark state , which consists of a scalar diquark and a vector antidiquark , and devote to calculate its mass with the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 lies above the @xmath16 threshold , the decay @xmath19 can take place with the fall - apart mechanism and it is ozi super - allowed , which can take into account the large width naturally .",
    "furthermore , whether or not there exists such a tetraquark configuration which can result in the state @xmath4 is of great importance itself , because it provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of low energy qcd .",
    "we explore this possibility , later experimental data can confirm or reject this assumption .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the mass of the @xmath0 in section 2 ; in section 3 , numerical result and discussion ; section 4 is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation function @xmath20 in the qcd sum rules , @xmath21 we choose the vector current @xmath22 which constructed from a scalar diquark and a vector antidiquark to interpolate the vector meson @xmath0 .    here we take a digression to discuss how to choose the interpolating currents for the tetraquark states .",
    "we can take either @xmath23 type or @xmath24 type currents to interpolate the tetraquark states , they are related to each other via fierz transformation both in the dirac spinor and color space @xcite . in this article , we take the @xmath23 type interpolating current .",
    "the diquarks have five dirac tensor structures , scalar @xmath25 , pseudoscalar @xmath26 , vector @xmath27 , axial vector @xmath28 and tensor @xmath29 . from those diquarks",
    ", we can construct six independent currents to interpolating the charmed tetraquark states with @xmath15 , @xmath30 and the general current @xmath31 can be written as their linear superposition , @xmath32 where the @xmath33 are some coefficients .",
    "the six interpolating currents can be sorted into three types , the currents @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 type , the currents @xmath37 and @xmath38 are @xmath39 type , the currents @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 type .",
    "we expect the three type interpolating currents result in three type of masses for the tetraquark states .",
    "the study with the random instanton liquid model indicates that the diquarks have masses about @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xcite , we expect the currents @xmath40 and @xmath41 interpolate the tetraquark states with masses larger than the ones for the currents @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "instanton induced force results in strong attraction in the scalar diquark channels and strong repulsion in the pseudoscalar diquark channels , if the instantons manifest themselves , the pseudoscalar diquarks will have much larger masses than the corresponding scalar diquarks @xcite , the coupled schwinger - dyson equation and bethe - salpeter equation also indicate this fact @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the one - gluon exchange force leads to significant attraction between the quarks in the @xmath46 channels @xcite .",
    "although the interpolating currents are not unique , the currents @xmath34 and @xmath35 are much better and interpolate tetraquark states with smaller mass , we can choose either one of them .    in the conventional qcd sum rules",
    "@xcite , there are two criteria ( pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion ) for choosing the borel parameter @xmath47 and threshold parameter @xmath48 . for the tetraquark states ,",
    "if the perturbative terms have the main contribution , we can approximate the spectral density with the perturbative term , @xmath49 where the @xmath50 are some numerical coefficients , then we take the pole dominance condition , @xmath51 and obtain the relation , @xmath52 the superpositions of different interpolating currents can only change the contributions from different terms in the operator product expansion , and improve convergence , they can not change the leading behavior of the spectral density @xmath53 of the perturbative term .    for the nonet light scalar mesons below @xmath3 , if their dominant fock components are tetraquark states , even we choose special superposition of different currents to weaken the contributions from the vacuum condensates to warrant the main contribution from the perturbative term , we can not choose very small borel parameter @xmath47 to enhance the pole term . for small enough borel parameter @xmath47 , the perturbative corrections of order @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , maybe large enough to invalidate the operator product expansion .",
    "we can choose the typical energy scale @xmath57 , in that energy scale , @xmath58 .",
    "there are many scalar mesons below @xmath59 @xcite , their contributions are already included in at the phenomenological side .",
    "pole dominance can not be fully satisfied for the tetraquark states with light flavor .",
    "failure of pole dominance do not mean non - existence of the tetraquark states , it just means that the qcd sum rules , as one of the qcd models , may have shortcomings .",
    "we release some criteria and take more phenomenological analysis , i.e. we choose larger borel parameter @xmath47 to warrant convergence of the operator product expansion and take a phenomenological cut off to avoid possible comminations from the high resonances and continuum states @xcite .    if we insist on to retain pole dominance besides convergence of the operator product expansion in the qcd sum rules for the tetraquark states , the hidden charmed and bottomed tetraquark states , and open bottomed tetraquark states may satisfy the criterion in eq.(7 ) , as they always have larger borel parameter @xmath47 and threshold parameter @xmath48 .    for examples , in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors take the @xmath60 as hidden charmed tetraquark state and calculate its mass with the qcd sum rules , the borel parameter and threshold parameter are taken as @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; in ref.@xcite , the authors take the @xmath63 as hidden charmed tetraquark state and calculate its mass with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , furthermore , the authors calculate the corresponding bottomed one , and choose @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) and @xmath68(or @xmath69 ) . in those sum rules , although the windows for the borel parameters are rather small , the @xmath70 is small enough to warrant convergence of the operator product expansion , the relation in eq.(7 ) can be well satisfied .",
    "the correlation function @xmath20 can be decomposed as    @xmath71    due to lorentz covariance .",
    "the invariant functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 stand for the contributions from the vector and scalar mesons , respectively . in this article , we choose the tensor structure @xmath74 to study the mass of the vector meson .    according to basic assumption of current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules @xcite , we insert a complete series of intermediate states satisfying unitarity principle with the same quantum numbers as the current operator @xmath22 into the correlation function @xmath20 to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the pole term of the lowest state @xmath0",
    ", we obtain the following result : @xmath75 where we have used the following definition , @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the polarization vector of the @xmath0 and @xmath78 is the residue of the pole .    in the following , we briefly outline operator product expansion for the correlation function @xmath79 in perturbative qcd theory .",
