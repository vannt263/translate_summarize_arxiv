    "it is a general feature of solutions of partial differential equations ( pde ) that spikes occur  @xcite .",
    "spikes occur in generic solutions of the einstein field equations ( efe ) of general relativity ( gr )  @xcite . indeed , when a self - similar solution of the efe is unstable , spikes can arise near such solutions .",
    "spikes , originally found in the context of vacuum orthogonally transitive ( ot ) @xmath0 models  @xcite , describe a dynamic and spatially inhomogeneous gravitational distortion .",
    "berger and moncrief first discovered spikes in their numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "rendall and weaver  @xcite discovered a composition of two transformations that can map spike - free solutions to solutions with spikes . using the rendall - weaver transformation",
    ", lim discovered an exact ot @xmath0 spike solution  @xcite .",
    "recently , this solution was generalized to the non - ot @xmath0 case by applying geroch s transformation on a kasner seed  @xcite .",
    "the new solution contains two more parameters than the ot @xmath0 spike solution .",
    "the mechanism of spike formation is simple  the state - space orbits of nearby worldlines approach a saddle point ; if this collection of orbits straddle the stable manifold of the saddle point , then one of the orbits becomes stuck on the stable manifold of the saddle point and heads towards the saddle point , while the neighbouring orbits leave the saddle point .",
    "this heuristic argument holds as long as spatial derivative terms have negligible effect . in the case of spikes",
    ", the spatial derivative terms do have significant effect , and the spike point that initially got stuck does leave the saddle point eventually , and the spike that formed becomes smooth again .      in  @xcite , further improved numerical evidence was presented that spikes in the mixmaster regime of @xmath0 cosmologies are transient and recurring , supporting the conjecture that the generalized mixmaster behavior is asymptotically non - local where spikes occur .",
    "it is believed that this recurring violation of bkl locality holds in more general spacetimes .",
    "we have previously shown explicitly that there exist ( @xmath0 ) recurring spikes leading to inhomogeneities and a small residual in the form of matter perturbations  @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in incomplete spikes .",
    "evolving away from the initial singularity , the oscillatory regime eventually ends when @xmath1 is no longer negligible , and some of the spikes are in the middle of transitioning , leaving inhomogeneous imprints on the matter result .",
    "the residuals from an incomplete spike might , in principle , be large and thus affect structure formation .",
    "the incomplete spikes associated with kasner saddles points occur generically in the early universe .",
    "both the incomplete spikes and the recurring spikes are potentially of physical importance .",
    "saddle points , related to self - similar solutions such as the kasner solutions and flrw models , may also occur at late times , and may also cause spikes / tilt that might lead to further matter inhomogeneities , albeit non - generically , which might lead to the existence of exceptional structures on large scales .",
    "belinskii , khalatnikov and lifshitz ( bkl ) @xcite have conjectured that within gr , the approach to the generic ( past ) spacelike singularity is vacuum dominated , local , and oscillatory ( i.e. , mixmaster ) .",
    "studies of @xmath0 and more general cosmological models have produced numerical evidence that the bkl conjecture generally holds except possibly at isolated points ( surfaces in the three - dimensional space ) where spiky structures (  spikes \" ) form @xcite .",
    "these spikes become ever narrower as the singularity is approached .",
    "the presence of such spikes violates the local part of the bkl conjecture .",
    "bkl considered the efe in synchronous coordinates and by dropping all spatial derivatives , which geometrically corresponds to neglecting the ricci 3-curvature of the spatial surfaces of the synchronous coordinate system , as well as all matter terms [ 1 ] .",
    "this procedure leads to a set of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) that are identical to those obtained in the vacuum case by imposing spatial homogeneity and an associated simply transitive abelian symmetry group , which results in the vacuum bianchi type i models whose solution is the well - known kasner solution .",
    "but in the general inhomogeneous context the constants of integration that appear in the kasner solution are replaced by spatially dependent functions , leading to a generalized kasner solution ( even though it is not a solution to the efe , it is a building block when one attempts to construct generic asymptotic solutions ) .",
    "bkl @xcite studied the influence of various kinds of matter upon the behavior of the general inhomogeneous solution of the gravitational field equations in the neighborhood of the initial singularity .",
    "depending on the form of the energy - momentum tensor , there are different possibilities . in a space filled with a perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath2 , for @xmath3 the oscillatory regime , as the singular point",
    "is approached asymptotically , remains the same as in vacuum .",
    "however , if @xmath4 we have the  stiff matter \" equation of state @xmath5 and neither the kasner epoch nor an oscillatory regime can exist in the vicinity of a singular point .",
    "this case has been investigated in @xcite where it has been shown that the influence of the  stiff matter \" ( equivalent to a massless scalar field ) results in ( the violation of the kasner relations and ) the jacobs relations @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an arbitrary three - dimensional function ( with the restriction @xmath8 ) to which the energy density @xmath9 of the matter is proportional ( where we assume that the stiff matter source is realized as a massless scalar field @xmath10 with @xmath11 where its asymptotic form is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 in comoving time ) .",
    "in contrast to the kasner relations , it is possible for all three exponents @xmath14 to be positive .",
    "it has been shown that , even if the contraction of space starts with the quasi - kasner epoch ( [ 4 ] ) during which one of the exponents @xmath14 is negative , the power law asymptotic behavior with all positive exponents is inevitably established after a finite number of oscillations and remains unchanged up to the singular point .",
    "thus , for the stiff equation of state the collapse in the general solution is described by monotonic ( but anisotropic ) contraction of space along all directions @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we wish to extend previous results to the massless scalar field / stiff perfect fluid case . in the next section",
    "we briefly review massless scalar fields and the techniques that have been used to generate exact stiff fluid solutions . as motivation",
    "we first generalize the ot @xmath0 vacuum spike solution to obtain a new exact ot @xmath0 stiff fluid spike solution , and analyse ot @xmath0 stiff fluid spike models both heuristically and numerically  ( see section  [ sec:2 ] ) .",

    "we first obtain a new class of exact non - ot @xmath0 stiff fluid spike solutions .",

    "we derive the evolution equations using different normalizations and gauge choices .",
    "in particular , the discovery of the exact non - ot @xmath0 stiff fluid spike solution motivates the use of the fluid - comoving gauge .",
    "we briefly discuss some of the qualitative properties of these models ( primarily to illustrate any new features of the models ) and discuss their numerical analysis .    in the final section",
    "we discuss the physical consequences of a stiff fluid or massless scalar field in the general relativistic generation of spikes .",
    "scalar fields are ubiquitous in the early universe in modern theories of theoretical physics . in the approach to the singularity",
    "it is known that the scalar field is dynamically massless @xcite . thus including massless scalar fields in early universe cosmology is important .",
    "the field equations of a minimally coupled scalar field with timelike gradient are formally the same as those of an irrotational stiff fluid",
    ".    we shall concentrate on showing how spikes generate matter overdensities in a radiation fluid in general relativity in a special class of inhomogeneous models in the initial regime of general massless scalar field cosmological models . in the initial oscillatory vacuum regime , we recall that spikes recur .",
    "we also wish to study the residual imprints of the spikes on matter inhomogeneities in the early universe in scalar field models . as the spike inhomogeneities form",
    ", matter undergoes gravitational instability and begins to collapse to form overdensities .",
    "we shall _ normalize _ using a @xmath15-normalization ; when utilizing the exact solutions obtained from a geroch transformation , @xmath15 is chosen to be the scale dependent determinant of the metric ( see section 3.1 ) . in the ot case under consideration below ,",

    "the dynamics of the new ( @xmath114 ) non - ot @xmath0 stiff fluid spike solutions is qualitatively different from that of the vacuum spike solution , in that the matter ( stiff fluid ) feels the spike directly and the stiff fluid spike solutions can end up with a permanent spike .",

    "we have been particularly interested in how a fluid , and especially a stiff fluid or massless scalar field , affects the physical consequences of the general relativistic generation of spikes .",
    "let us briefly discuss this further .",
    "in previous work @xcite we explicitly showed that spikes naturally occur in a class of non - vacuum @xmath0 models and , due to gravitational instability , leave small residual imprints on matter in the form of matter perturbations .",
    "we have been particularly interested in recurring and complete spikes formed in the oscillatory regime ( or recurring spikes for short )  @xcite and incomplete spikes , and their imprint on matter and structure formation .",
    "we have obtained further numerical evidence for the existence of spikes and general relativistic matter perturbations  @xcite , which support the results of @xcite .",
    "we have generalized these results to massless scalar field / stiff perfect fluid models in this paper to further illustrate the possible existence of a general relativistic mechanism for generating matter perturbations of physical interest .    with a tilted fluid",
    ", the tilt provides another mechanism in generating matter inhomogeneities due to the non - negligible divergence term caused by the instability in the tilt . in  @xcite we investigated the evolution equations of the ot @xmath0 models with a perfect fluid and we concluded that it is the tilt instability that plays the primary role in the formation of matter inhomogeneities in these models ( while the spike mechanism plays a secondary role in generating matter inhomogeneities ) .    in the early universe",
    "we have explicitly shown that there exist @xmath0 recurring spikes that lead to inhomogeneities and a residual in the form of matter perturbations , that these occur naturally within generic cosmology models within gr , and that they are not local but form on surfaces and give rise to a distribution of perturbations . in @xmath0 models",
    "these spike surfaces are parallel and do not intersect . in general spacetimes however , two spikes surfaces may intersect along a curve , and this curve may intersect with a third spike surface at a point , leading to matter inhomogeneities forming on a web of surfaces , curves and points .",
    "there are tantalising hints that filamentary structures and voids would occur naturally in this scenario .",
    "inflationary cosmology provides a causal mechanism which generates the primordial perturbations which were later responsible for the formation of large scale structures of our universe due to gravitational collapse .",
    "the density perturbations produced during inflation are due to quantum fluctuations in the matter and gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "primeval fluctuations , which are subsequently amplified outside the hubble radius , are then thought to be present at the end of the inflationary epoch . previously , we have speculated @xcite whether recurring spikes might be an alternative to the inflationary mechanism for generating matter perturbations in the early universe .",
    "indeed , there are some similarities with the perturbations and structure formation created in cosmic string models  @xcite ; the inhomogeneities occur on closed circles or infinite lines @xcite , similar to what happens in the case of topological defects .",
    "saddles , related to kasner solutions and flrw models , may also occur at late times , and may also cause spikes / tilt that might lead to further matter inhomogeneities , albeit non - generically .",
    "permanent spikes in ltb models were studied in @xcite , which might offer an alternative general relativistic spike mechanism for naturally generating ( a small number of ) exceptional structures at late times .",
