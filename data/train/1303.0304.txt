    "supernova ( sn ) 2009ip provided a truly remarkable sequence of events , first noted as a sn `` impostor '' or eruption of a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) in 2009 ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ) , and then subsequently observed as a core - collapse sn in mid / late 2012 ( mauerhan et al.2013 ) .",
    "it joins sn  1987a ( walborn et al .",
    "1989 ; rousseau et al.1978 ) as the only sn for which we have a direct detection _ and a spectrum _ of the progenitor star . in the case of sn  2009ip",
    ", however , we have a much more detailed record and higher quality data pertaining to its unstable pre - sn state .",
    "it is reminiscent of the pre - sn outburst seen 2 yr before sn  2006jc ( pastorello et al .",
    "2007 ) , but in that case only one outburst was detected and no spectrum was obtained .",
    "a brief recounting of sn  2009ip s pre - sn activity is as follows :    after the discovery of sn  2009ip as a new transient source in august 2009 ( maza et al .  2009 ) , it was recognized that it was not a true sn , but was instead a non - terminal eruptive transient similar to lbvs .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2010 ) presented archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images , archival ground - based photometry , and new photometry and spectra of the outburst . _ hst _ data revealed that 10 yr prior to discovery , the quiescent progenitor was a luminous supergiant with @xmath8 and a likely initial mass of around 50 - 80 @xmath6 , while the archival ground - based photometry documented a @xmath25 yr long s dor - like lbv phase that preceded the 2009 discovery .",
    "the 2009 outburst itself had a peak absolute magnitude of around @xmath914.5 ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ) , similar to giant lbv eruptions ( smith et al .",
    "spectra of the 2009 outburst showed strong balmer emission lines similar to lbv eruptions ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2011 ) , indicating an expansion speed of order 550 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the 2009 outburst of sn  2009ip was unusual compared to most lbv - like eruptions , however , due to the rapid brightening and fading over a few weeks instead of a few months to years ( smith et al .",
    "foley et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented additional spectra and a reanalysis of the archival _ hst _ data that reinforced these conclusions .",
    "after these first papers on the 2009 outburst , sn  2009ip then had another outburst of similar magnitude in 2010 ( drake et al .",
    "2010 ) , and it has recently been reported ( pastorello et al .",
    "2013 ) that it had additional eruptions of similar brightness since then as well .    on 2012",
    "july 24 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , sn  2009ip was discovered to have yet another outburst ( drake et al .",
    "this new outburst was of similar magnitude to the previous ones , and at first it was assumed that this was yet another lbv - like eruption .",
    "foley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported that an early spectrum obtained on 2012 aug .",
    "24 was consistent with spectra of the previous lbv - like outbursts , with line widths around 600 km s@xmath10 .",
    "however , spectra obtained later on 2012 sep .",
    "7 - 16 ( smith & mauerhan 2012 ) revealed a transformation in the spectrum of sn  2009ip , which now showed very broad balmer emission and absorption lines out to speeds of 13,000 km s@xmath10 .",
    "these broad features indicated that the impostor sn  2009ip was becoming a true core - collapse sn ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2012 ) , since these spectral features had never been seen previously in this object or any lbv eruption .",
    "pastorello et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have pointed out that broad features were seen previously , but these were only seen in absorption ( as noted earlier by smith et al .",
    "2010 and foley et al.2011 ) , while emission - line components of sn  2009ip had always shown narrow or intermediate - width emission lines prior to sep .",
    "small amounts of very fast material have been seen around lbvs , as in the case of @xmath11  carinae ( smith 2008 ) , but the bulk velocity of most of the ejected mass in lbv eruptions is much slower .    the broad emission lines in sn  2009ip were first noted in sep .",
    "2012 , around the time of peak luminosity for the precursor outburst ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the object faded over the next week or so , but then brightened very suddenly , rising @xmath23 mag in a few days .",
    "this very rapid brightening was probably caused by the fast sn ejecta crashing into slower circumstellar material ( csm ) ejected by the precursor eruptions ( mauerhan et al .",
    "prieto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented exceptionally high - cadence photometry of this very rapid brightening phase , also concluding that this was most likely due to the onset of sn - csm interaction similar to other sne iin .",
    "indeed , as it reached peak luminosity , the spectrum took on the character of a normal sn  iin with a smooth blue continuum and balmer lines exhibiting narrow line cores and lorentzian scattering wings ( mauerhan et al.2012 ) .",
    "levesque et al .  (",
    "2013 ) have recently presented additional spectra of the sn , highlighting aspects of its balmer decrement .",
    "sn  2009ip gives vivid confirmation of the idea that very massive and eruptive lbv - like stars can explode to produce sne  iin ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a , 2011 ; gal - yam et al .  2007 ; gal - yam & leonard 2009 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lc ] we also plot the light curve of sn  2010mc for comparison , recently reported by ofek et al .",
    "ofek et al.discussed the remarkable detection of a precursor outburst in this type  iin event as well , but they did not note the uncanny similarity to the light curve of sn  2009ip ( which was still underway as their paper was in preparation ) . figure  [ fig : lc ] emphasizes that _ these two objects are nearly identical _ in terms of peak luminosities and timescales for both the precursor and sn outbursts ( the absolute magnitudes have not been adjusted ) .",
    "since most sne  iin observed thus far have been discovered near peak and lack high - quality pre - sn observations , it may be the case that the erratic pre - sn variability of sn  2009ip is not so unusual .    here",

    "eight exposures were obtained in an abba pattern at an average airmass 1.52 , for a total exposure of 840  s. the nearby a0  v star hd  202941 ( @xmath18 = 7.05 mag ) was observed immediately after for flux calibration and telluric absorption correction , along with internal flat field and arc lamp exposures .",

    "the low - resolution instrumental setup , observations of an a0 v standard , and data reduction procedures were nearly the same as described above for the previous fire epoch , except that we used a different standard star ( hd  219341 ) .",
    "a striking aspect of the spectral sequence in figure  [ fig : irspec ] ( top ) is that the first - epoch spectrum on sep .",
    "22 is substantially different from those on sep .",
    "27 and oct .  14 , which appear qualitatively very similar to each other .",
    "one particular difference is in the continuum shape . for comparison , representative blackbody curves ( blue )",
    "are plotted along with each epoch of the observed spectra , suggesting that the apparent color temperature increases from @xmath23400  k on sep .",
    "22 , to 6000  k and 7500  k on the two later epochs .",
    "continuum slopes matching temperatures of 6000 - 7500  k are typical for sne  iin , and the spectral characteristics ( strong h lines ) are consistent with that range of temperatures .",
    "however , the much lower temperature of 3400  k implicated by the ir continuum slope on sep .",
    "22 is not commensurate with the presence of he i and h emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "therefore , a cooler photospheric temperature is not the likely explanation for the continuum shape ( the 3400  k blackbody underpredicts the flux near 1 @xmath0 m anyway ) .",
    "two possible alternatives involving dust are discussed below .",
    "first , a redder color on sep .",
    "22 than at later times could potentially arise from significant reddening by csm dust , which is destroyed at later epochs as the sn brightens and the shock expands .",
    "the orange curve in figure  [ fig : irspec ] ( top panel ) shows the oct .",
    "14 spectrum reddened by @xmath1=1.0 mag , providing a satisfactory match to the shape of the observed spectrum on sep .  22 .",
    "this is unlikely to be the real explanation for the observed color , however , because the amount of reddening required to match the ir continuum shape would cause even more severe reddening at visual wavelengths .",
    "this is demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : irspec ] , where we plot visual - wavelength spectra taken 1 - 3 days later ( already published by mauerhan et al .",
    "2013 ) alongside the sep .",
    "22 fire spectrum .",
    "the two orange curves ( solid and dashed ) show hot blackbodies ( 7500 and 13,000 k , respectively ) that are reddened to approximate the shape of the near ir continuum , using @xmath1=1.0 and 1.5 mag , respectively .",
    "while these reddened blackbodies seem to match the ir continuum shape , the flux at visual wavelengths fall far below the observed visual wavelength spectra taken only 1 and 3 days later ( note that these visual spectra have been adjusted in flux by a few per cent so that the @xmath29000 fluxes match the ir spectra , correcting for the fact that sn  2009ip was variable ) .",
    "instead of reddening , a more likely explanation for the ir color is an extra contribution from _ emission _ of dust instead of absorption .",
    "the magenta spectrum plotted against the observed sep .",
    "22 spectrum is , once again , the spectrum near peak on oct .  14 , but with an added contribution from hot dust emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : irspec ] , top panel ) . for simplicity",
    ", we used a 2000  k blackbody modified by @xmath19 emissivity . when added to the oct .",
    "14 spectrum , it matches the overall shape of the sep .",
    "22 near - ir continuum very well .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ figlirspec ] shows that the combination ( magenta curve ) of a hot blackbody ( 13000 k , blue ) and the same 2000 k dust component ( green dashed ) can match both the visual wavelength and ir spectra simultaneously .",
    "the fact that the visual - wavelength continuum requires a hotter blackbody ( 13,000 ) than the temperature implied by fitting the ir continuum alone ( 7500k ) merely reflects that fact that ir wavelengths on the rayleigh - jeans tail of a planck function are a less sensitive probe of the underlying hot component .",
    "this ir excess presumably arises from csm dust heated by the luminosity of the precursor transient source , as in an `` ir echo ''",
    ". dust at around this temperature is as hot as dust can be , residing at the innermost radius of the dust shell , inside of which the dust is destroyed .",
    "carinae has a similar high temperature ( smith 2010 ) even though @xmath11 car is known to be severely carbon deficient . for @xmath11 car , the hot dust",
    "is thought to be corundum ( al@xmath20o@xmath21 ) , which condenses at a similar high temperature . ]",
    "this general picture is similar to the ir echoes observed in many sne , particularly common among sne  iin ( see fox et al .",
    "2011 , and references therein ) due to their dense and dusty pre - existing csm .",
    "22 before the rapid brightening , sn  2009ip had a luminosity of roughly @xmath224@xmath410@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "csm dust in equilibrium at 2000  k would then reside at a radius of    @xmath25    ( where @xmath26 is the ratio of the grain absorption to emission efficiency ) , which is around 120 au for large grains that behave like blackbodies ( @xmath27 ) , or somewhat farther from the star for smaller grain sizes that have larger values of @xmath26 . equation ( 1 ) really provides a lower limit to the radius of the dust shell , since it could be farther away if dust is condensing as an ejected shell expands and cools ( e.g. , kochanek et al .  2011 ) .",
    "this is , therefore , probably not dust that formed from the beginning of the 2012 eruption @xmath240 days earlier , because that material would be too close to the star . expanding at around 550 km s@xmath10 ( smith et al .",
    "2010 ) , the implied age is at least 1.1 yr , making it seem quite plausible that this dust formed from ejecta in one of its previous documented outbursts ( see mauerhan et al .",
    "2012 , smith et al .  2010 ; drake et al .  2010 ; pastorello et al .",
    "2013).2100 k dust excess around the lbv - like transient ugc2773-ot .",
    "] in any case , it should be noted that this hot csm dust that contributes to the emission in the ir spectrum on sep .",
    "22 will not necessarily cause any corresponding absorption along our line - of - sight to the sn photosphere , since the geometry may be globally non - spherical or clumpy .    the contribution of this dust emission could weaken as time proceeds , either because some of the nearby csm dust gets destroyed , or because the dust emission simply makes a smaller contribution to the total flux as the brightness of the sn photosphere increases . ) .",
    "this drop in flux from the underlying photosphere would serve to enhance the contrast of the ir excess from dust at this epoch . ] both appear to be happening . by the time sn  2009ip reached its peak , it had a luminosity of roughly 1.3@xmath410@xmath28 @xmath24 .",
    "the same dust that was at @xmath12=120 au and 2000  k would then be heated to an equilibrium temperature of 4800  k ( equation 1 ) , vaporizing dust grains at that radius .",
    "( moreover , the blast wave of the sn itself may have been approaching roughly the same radius by this point . )",
    "this destruction should happen as the sn brightens , but the ir excess might not disappear if there is additional dust at larger radii from previous outbursts that could be heated to the same temperature by the increasing luminosity .",
    "in fact , some ir excess emission does seem to persist .",
    "the magenta spectrum plotted against the sep .",
    "27 spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : irspec ] ( top ) shows the same contribution of hot dust at the same 2000  k temperature , except that the relative contribution of the dust is less .",
    "this smaller relative contribution from hot dust matches the spectral shape very well , especially the excess flux longward of 1.8 @xmath0 m , and mimics the appearance of a cooler photospheric temperature ( 6000  k vs. 7500  k at peak ) .",
    "a smaller contribution of hot dust may also be present even in the oct .",
    "14 spectrum around the time of peak luminosity , since it appears to have a small amount of excess flux beyond 2 @xmath0 m .",
    "the mass of hot dust can be inferred from the ir excess if the grains are small ( @xmath29 m ; following smith & gehrz 2005 and smith et al .",
    "2008b ) , which for grains with a density of @xmath30=2.25 g @xmath31 can be expressed as    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the luminosity of the hot dust component at a temperature @xmath34 .",
    "the 2000 k dust that contributes the ir excess in our pre - sn spectrum on sep 23 has a luminosity @xmath3510@xmath36 @xmath24 , although this comes with a large uncertainty of perhaps @xmath3750% due to possible slit losses in the exposures of sn  2009ip or the standard star .",
    "nevertheless , this provides a very rough estimate of the mass of hot dust of roughly ( 3 - 6)@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "this is , of course , only a lower limit to the total circumstellar dust mass because our near - ir data only trace the hottest dust , while a large additional mass of cooler dust may emit at longer ir wavelengths .",
    "lastly , we note that additional ir flux from free - free emision due to an ionized stellar wind , which often causes ir excess in hot stars ( wright & barlow 1975 ) , can not explain the red color because the slope from free - free emission is too blue at the shortest ir wavelengths . the dashed brown curve in figure  [ fig : irspec ] ( top )",
    "shows the expected free - free ir emission from a constant - speed stellar wind .    10830 , ( b ) pa @xmath38 , and ( c ) pa @xmath39.,width=249 ]",
    "line profiles for the three brightest lines in the ir spectrum are plotted in figure  [ fig : vel ] , showing `` before '' and `` after '' spectra of he  i @xmath710830 , pa  @xmath38 , and pa  @xmath39 taken at the same resolution with the fire spectrograph .",
    "the most notable change in the line profiles is seen in he  i @xmath710830 . in the first epoch before the brightening , this line exhibits a very strong and broad p cygni absorption trough extending to a blue edge of @xmath913,000 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this is the same speed as seen in the blue edge of the p cygni absorption in balmer lines over the preceding week or so ( mauerhan et al .  2012 ) .",
    "this broad he   i absorption then disappears when the sn brightens to peak.50% , depending on wavelength ) of the near - ir continuum comes from hot csm dust in an echo , rather than from the sn itself .",
    "this has the effect of diluting the apparent relative strength of emission / absorption lines . in other words ,",
    "the ir emission / absorption features are stronger than they appear in this spectrum ( i.e. the true intrinsic equivalent width is larger ) . ]",
    "balmer lines show the same disappearance of the broad profiles at peak ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2012 ) , presumably for the same reason ",
    "i.e. , the spectrum becomes dominated by opaque csm interaction .",
    "the narrow emission components of he  i @xmath710830 show little or no change before and after the rapid brightening , relative to the continuum . the metastable nature of he  i @xmath710830 absorption makes it difficult to use it to draw conclusions about the relative he abundance in the fast ejecta , and there are few sne  iin with comparable near - ir spectra for comparison .",
    "pa  @xmath38 and pa  @xmath39 do not show any strong broad p cygni absorption , as is seen in balmer lines and he  i @xmath710830 .",
