    "polarized ( synchrotron ) radio emission is a rich source of information about the relativistic and thermal plasmas and magnetic fields in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "recent observations have revealed an abundance of unexpected features that arise from the propagation of the emission through the turbulent ism @xcite .",
    "arguably the most eye - catching is the pattern of depolarized canals : a random network of dark narrow regions , clearly visible against a bright polarized background .",
    "these canals evidently carry information about the ism , but it is still not quite clear how this information can be extracted .",
    "two theories for the origin of the canals have been proposed ; both attribute the canals to the effects of faraday rotation , but one invokes steep gradients of the faraday rotation measure ( @xmath0 ) across the telescope beam , in a faraday screen @xcite , whereas the other relies on the line - of - sight effects producing differential faraday rotation @xcite . in order to use the canal properties to derive parameters of the ism , one must correctly identify their origin .    in this letter",
    "we briefly discuss a few important aspects of the two theories describing the origin of canals .",
    "detailed discussion of relevant depolarization mechanisms is presented in ( * ? ? ? * and in preparation ) .",
    "canals produced by faraday rotation measure gradients are discussed in section  [ sec : screen ] where we show that these canals require a _ discontinuous _ distribution of free electrons and/or magnetic field ; we further suggest an interpretation of the discontinuities in terms of interstellar shocks .",
    "the case of differential faraday rotation is discussed in section  [ sec : diffrot ] ; in section  [ sec : origin ] we suggest an observational test that can be used to identify the specific mechanism that produces a given canal .",
    "the defining features of the canals are as follows :    1 .",
    "[ itemi ] the observed polarized emission @xmath6 approaches the polarization noise level @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; 2 .",
    "the canal is about one beam wide ; 3 .",
    "the canal passes through a region of significant polarized intensity , say @xmath9 ; 4 .   the canal is not related to any structure in total intensity , and so can not be readily explained by , e.g. , an intervening gas or magnetic filament .",
    "polarized intensity vanishes when emission within the telescope beam consists of two equal parts with mutually orthogonal polarization planes .",
    "thus , feature [ itemi ] most often arises because the polarization angle @xmath10 changes by @xmath3 across the canal .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : screen ] we predict a new type of canal across which the observed polarization angle does not change .",
    "we only consider canals occurring in properly calibrated maps : @xcite argue that the observations we discuss in section  [ sec : meansep ] do not suffer from missing large - scale structure ; @xcite discusses the calibration of radio polarization maps in depth .",
    "polarized radiation is commonly described in terms of the complex polarization , @xmath11 where @xmath12 , the degree of polarization , is the fraction of the radiation flux that is polarized . when polarized emission passes through magnetized and ionised regions , the local polarization angle @xmath13 ( at position @xmath14 ) changes by an amount depending on the wavelength @xmath15 due to the faraday effect @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a constant , @xmath18 is the number density of free thermal electrons , @xmath19 is the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight ( here aligned with the @xmath20-axis ) , and the observer is located at @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is known as the _ faraday depth to a position @xmath20 _ and gives the change in polarization angle of a photon of wavelength @xmath23 as it propagates from @xmath20 to the observer .",
    "the maximum amount of faraday rotation in a given direction is called the _ _ faraday depth _ _ , in our notation .",
    "however , it is more convenient , and physically better motivated , to define the faraday depth , similarly to the optical depth , as a dimensionless quantity , as used by @xcite and @xcite ] @xmath24 the observed amount of faraday rotation , determined by the rotation measure @xmath25 , can not exceed @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is related to @xmath26 , but often in a complicated manner ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simplest is the case of a faraday screen , where the source of synchrotron emission is located behind a magneto - ionic region ( e.g. , because relativistic and thermal electrons occupy disjoint regions ) : then @xmath28 . in a homogeneous region , where relativistic and thermal electrons are uniformly mixed , @xmath29 .",
    "observations of linearly polarized emission provide the stokes parameters @xmath30 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 which are related to @xmath12 and @xmath10 via @xmath31 : @xmath32\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the polarized intensity is @xmath33 . the complex polarization can be written in terms of @xmath34 , @xmath35\\right\\}{\\mathrm d}v\\ ; , \\label{cpf}\\ ] ] where integration extends over the volume of the telescope beam @xmath36 , @xmath37 defines the shape of the beam , a function of position in the sky plane @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the synchrotron emissivity . the total intensity is similarly given by @xmath40 ; the faraday depth is a function of @xmath41 , @xmath42",
    "with respect to transverse distance in the sky plane @xmath43 .",
    "the faraday depth changes by @xmath44 across the distance @xmath45 and by @xmath46 within the beamwidth @xmath47.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]         consider polarized emission from a uniform background source passing through a faraday screen  a layer where no further emission occurs , but which rotates the polarized plane .",
    "if @xmath26 varies with @xmath41 , adjacent lines of sight within the beam are subject to different amounts of faraday rotation and the observed degree of polarization decreases . if the variation of @xmath26 within the beam , @xmath46 ( fig .  [ fig : grad ] ) , produces a @xmath3 difference in @xmath10 , one might expect that the depolarization will be complete as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ screen](a ) , and a canal will be observed along contours defined by @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the situation is more subtle , though .",
    "figure  [ screen](b ) shows @xmath10 changing _ smoothly _ by @xmath3 across a beam , as a result of a monotonic change in faraday depth by the same amount , @xmath50 , as in panel ( a ) .",
    "it is obvious that polarized emission does _ not _ cancel within the beam ; the polarized intensity will be lower than for a uniform arrangement of angles but there will still be a polarized signal detected with a polarization angle of about @xmath51 .",
    "thus , gradients in @xmath26 across the beam can produce complete depolarization in a faraday screen if @xmath26 changes by @xmath52 within a small fraction of the beam width . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin ] ( solid line ) , obtained using eqs  ( [ eq : qup ] ) and ( [ cpf ] ) , the depth of a canal will only be less than @xmath53 of the surrounding polarized emission if the gradient in @xmath26 occurs over one fifth or less of the beam : @xmath54 , where @xmath45 is the extent of the region where the gradient occurs and @xmath47 is the beamwidth .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion in an analysis of the depth and profile of canals observed at @xmath55 ( see their sect .",
    "4.4 ) .    as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ screen](c ) and [ fig : pmin ] ( dotted line ) , a variation in @xmath26 of a magnitude @xmath56 across the fwhm of the gaussian beam ( i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) can also produce strong depolarization but now the change in polarization angle across the beam is @xmath59 .",
    "similarly other gradients in @xmath26 can significantly reduce the degree of polarization ; for example @xmath60 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin ] ) across a region that is about @xmath61 the beamwidth will produce complete depolarization and a change in angle of @xmath62 across the beam .",
    "larger gradients in @xmath26 also result in strong depolarization and when @xmath63 the degree of depolarization is less sensitive to the resolution .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin ] for the case where @xmath64 ( dash - dotted line ) ; complete depolarization occurs when @xmath65 but in the range @xmath66 the degree of polarization remains below the @xmath53 level .",
    "thus an increment of @xmath64 , and more generally @xmath67 , will produce one beam wide canals when the gradient occurs in a region roughly equal to or less than the beamwidth , i.e. where @xmath68 .",
    "other large gradients in @xmath26 , such as @xmath69 , depolarize to around @xmath53 of the background @xmath12 and therefore can also produce canals ; however in this case one beam wide canals will only be formed when @xmath58 .    , as a function of the relative linear extent of the gradient @xmath70 , where @xmath47 is the fwhm of a gaussian beam and @xmath43 is the position in the sky - plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grad ] ) .",
    "different curves represent different increments in faraday depth , @xmath44 ( identified in the legend ) . for @xmath71 ( an unresolved gradient )",
    ", @xmath26 changes over a distance smaller than the beamwidth and @xmath44 is effectively discontinuous for @xmath72.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    so , if @xmath26 is a continuous , random , function of position ( with sufficiently strong fluctuations on the scale of the beam ) we predict the existence of canals with every change in polarization angle @xmath73 across the beam . on the other hand _ a discontinuous change in @xmath26 _ by @xmath74 , will produce canals across which the polarization angle changes by @xmath75 .",
    "this insight is important as to - date all observed canals have @xmath76 .",
    "the only other way in which faraday screens can consistently produce canals with this change in angle is if _ all _ the gradients in faraday depth on the approximate scale of the beamwidth are of the magnitude @xmath77 , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 in this case only produces weak depolarization , as noted above ) ; this is extremely unlikely in a random medium .",
    "if a system of observed canals has @xmath75 and is caused by a foreground faraday screen  see section  [ sec : origin ] for a diagnostic test for the origin of canals  then the distribution of rotation measure in the screen must be discontinuous on the scale of the beam .",
    "@xcite used mhd simulations of mach @xmath80 turbulence to show that @xmath0 gradients can be steep enough to produce depolarized canals on smoothing with a sufficiently large simulated beam .",
    "note that a finite beam size is essential for the production of canals by this mechanism ; with perfect resolution the width of the shock front will be resolved and no canal will appear .",
    "furthermore , these canals will not fill up if the data are smoothed ( solid and dash - dotted curves for @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin ] ) whereas canals produced by gradients other than @xmath67 will disappear under smoothing at a rate shown with dashed and dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmin ] .      an obvious source of faraday depth discontinuities",
    "are shocks in the ism .",
    "then the mean distance between the canals produced by a faraday screen will be related to the distance between the shock fronts .",
    "the expected separation of suitable shock fronts can be derived using the model of interstellar shock - wave turbulence of @xcite and then compared with the separation of canals observed by @xcite , claimed to arise in a faraday screen .",
    "if the frequency distribution of interstellar shocks of mach number @xmath82 is @xmath83 , the mean number of shocks of a strength exceeding @xmath82 that cross a given position in the ism per unit time can be obtained as @xmath84 and the mean separation between the shocks in three dimensions follows as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the sound speed .",
    "the separation in the plane of the sky is reduced by @xmath87 due to projection effects and multiplied by a further factor @xmath88 if the shocks occur in a region of depth @xmath89 . at an average distance to the shocks of @xmath90 , the average angular separation in the sky plane",

    "we then obtain the following expression for the separation of shock fronts with @xmath103 in three dimensions : @xmath104^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the supernovae rate and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the radius and scale height of the star - forming disc .",
    "the term in square brackets is approximately @xmath108 for @xmath95 and @xmath109 .    if the magnetic field is frozen into the gas and the gas density increases by a factor @xmath110 at the shock then so will the field strength ( we neglect a factor @xmath111 due to the relative alignment of the shock and field ) .",
    "a canal forms where @xmath26 increases discontinuously by @xmath48 .",
    "so the required density compression ratio is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the mean value of @xmath26 .",
    "the gas compression ratio depends on the shock mach number @xmath82 as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath114 where we have used @xmath115 for the ratio of specific heats , which yields the value of the shock mach number required to produce a canal : @xmath116    in the field of canals observed by @xcite at @xmath117 , @xmath118 and a by - eye estimate of their mean separation gives @xmath119 .",
    "the most abundant canals are produced by the shocks which can generate @xmath50 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mrm ] ) this requires @xmath120 .",
    "using @xmath121 , taking @xmath95 and the parameter values used to normalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : snshock ] ) , we obtain @xmath122 for shocks with @xmath103 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath123 includes shocks with @xmath124 that will not produce canals , but the strong dependence of @xmath125 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gsnshock ] ) on mach number means that @xmath123 will underestimate the separation of canal generating shocks insignificantly . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lshock2d ] ) , with @xmath122 and @xmath119 , we find that the canals observed by @xcite are compatible with a system of shocks occurring in a faraday screen with a depth of @xmath126 . the maximum distance in this field , beyond which emission",
    "is completely depolarized , is estimated to be @xmath127 by @xcite .",
    "thus this model for the canals origin requires that the nearest @xmath128 in the direction @xmath129 is effectively devoid of cosmic ray electrons ; if the cosmic rays normally spread over a distance @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the alfvn speed and @xmath132 their lifetime , such a condition is difficult to explain .",
    "in section  [ sec : screen ] we discussed the depolarization effects of faraday rotation measure gradients transverse to the line of sight acting on smooth polarized background emission .",
    "now we will consider a uniform layer in which both emission and faraday rotation occur .",
    "this gives rise to the well known effect of differential faraday rotation @xcite , where polarized emission from two positions along the line of sight separated by a rotation of @xmath133 exactly cancel , thus reducing the degree of polarization .",
    "when a line of sight has a total rotation of @xmath134 there is total cancellation of all polarized emission in the layer and the degree of polarization is @xmath135 .",
    "canals produced by this mechanism are discussed by @xcite .",
    "we now investigate how canals produced by differential faraday rotation are affected by deviations from uniformity in the magneto - ionic medium .",
    "first we will discuss the case of a two - layer medium in which the synchrotron emissivity is different in each layer .",
    "then we allow for random fluctuations of @xmath26 ( the latter case produces what is known as faraday dispersion ) .",
    "for a two - layer medium the fractional polarization can be written as @xmath136 where we have assumed @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the synchrotron fluxes from the furthest and nearest layers to the observer respectively , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the faraday depths through the two layers .",
    "[ this is similar to eq .",
    "( 10 ) in @xcite , but with typos corrected .",
    "] we assume that @xmath143 , the condition for canals to form due to differential faraday rotation , and investigate what will happen to the canals if @xmath144 .",
    "we parametrize the difference in the synchrotron emissivity in the two layers as @xmath145 , choose equal faraday rotation through each layer for simplicity so @xmath146 , and substitute these into eq .",
    "( [ eq : twolayer ] ) .",
    "we then obtain the dependence of the minimum degree of polarization on @xmath147 : @xmath148 thus , for a moderate difference in emissivity of @xmath149 between two layers the canals will have a depth of @xmath150 compared to @xmath151 for a strictly uniform medium ; these canals will still be clearly visible and can be interpreted as e.g. contours of @xmath26 or @xmath0 @xcite . where the difference in emissivity is greater , say @xmath152 or more as one might expect viewing distant bright spiral arm emission near the galactic plane",
    ", the canals will more readily fill up , become much less distinct and more difficult to interpret confidently .",
    "now let us consider the effect of random fluctuations in faraday rotation , sometimes called internal faraday dispersion .",
    "we start with eq .",
    "( 34 ) of @xcite : @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the standard deviation of the faraday depth @xmath26 . in order to produce canals we need @xmath156 and",
    "then @xmath157 the term in brackets shows the powerful depolarization resulting from internal faraday dispersion ( see @xcite ) : for large enough @xmath155 depolarization is complete .",
    "however , as long as @xmath158 , canals produced by differential faraday rotation will only fill up by @xmath159 or less .",
    "for example , at @xmath160 the canals will not be destroyed as long as the dispersion in faraday rotation measure is less than @xmath161 .",
    "this is why canals are still visible in the @xmath160 map studied by @xcite which has a dispersion in rotation measure of about @xmath162 , i.e. @xmath163 .",
    "the complex polarization emitted by a layer producing differential faraday rotation can be written as @xcite @xmath164 we can see immediately that if @xmath137 we have @xmath165 and @xmath166 . since the orientation of the coordinate system in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 are defined is arbitrary ( i.e. the reference line from which we measure polarization angles can have any orientation )",
    ", we can always choose a system in which @xmath137 near a canal .",
    "at the axis of a canal @xmath167 , but in the case of a canal produced by differential faraday rotation there exists a reference frame in the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) plane where one of the two stokes parameters changes sign across a canal but the other does not .    if , otherwise , a canal is produced by discontinuities in faraday rotation across the beam ( sect .",
    "[ sec : screen ] ) we have @xcite @xmath168 in the vicinity of a canal and both @xmath1 and @xmath2 will change sign across a canal ( given @xmath137 ) except in the special case @xmath169 .",
    "the change in sign occurs since @xmath170 $ ] on one side of the canal and @xmath171 $ ] on the other : a similar variation occurs in @xmath172 .",
    "therefore the behaviour of the observed stokes parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 across a canal provides a way to distinguish between canals produced by foreground faraday screens and those resulting from differential faraday rotation .",
    "the main points of this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the behaviour of the stokes parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the vicinity of a canal allows one to identify whether a foreground faraday screen or differential faraday rotation is the cause of the canal ( section  [ sec : origin ] ) .",
    "2 .   a foreground faraday screen can produce canals with any polarization angle change across the canal , @xmath173 .",
    "however , discontinuous jumps in the faraday depth will only produce canals with @xmath76 ( section  [ sec : screen ] ) .",
    "3 .   if shocks produce the discontinuities in a foreground faraday screen that generate canals , the mean separation of the canals can provide information about the mach number and separation of shocks in the screen ( section  [ sec : meansep ] ) .",
    "4 .   canals produced by differential faraday rotation are sensitive to non - uniformity in the medium along the line of sight , systematic or random .",
    "however , they will remain recognisable if the synchrotron emissivity varies by less than a factor of about @xmath174 or if the standard deviation of the faraday depth is @xmath158 ( section  [ subsec : diffrot ] ) .",
