    "the recent discoveries of optical counterparts of the @xmath3-ray bursts grb  970228 ( groot  1997 ) and grb  970508 ( bond 1997 ) and the measured emission - line redshift of @xmath8 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) for the latter provide evidence for their cosmological origin .",
    "a possible source for @xmath3-ray bursts ( grbs ) may be the merging of two neutron stars in a close binary ( blinnikov  1984 ) . for cosmologies with no vacuum energy , the brightness distribution of burst intensities expected for a uniform source population",
    "is consistent with the batse distribution if the limiting redshift is about unity ( e.g. dermer 1992 ; mao & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "however , cosmological time - dilation effects in the batse sample indicate that the dimmest sources should be located at @xmath9 ( norris et al .",
    "1995 ) . if this is the actual limiting redshift , a source population with a comoving rate density of the form @xmath10 is compatible with the batse distribution for @xmath11 ( horack et al .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to examine whether the comoving merger rate density of neutron - star binaries evolves in a similar fashion .    by means of population synthesis computations for binary stars the merger rate of neutron - star binaries [ hereafter ] can be computed ( see portegies zwart & yungelson 1998 and references therein ) . using this approach lipunov  ( 1995 ) computed the evolution of mergers as a function of redshift and @xmath12  distributions of grbs for a cosmic population which contains galaxies with a constant star - formation rate and also galaxies with initial bursts of star formation in different proportions .",
    "totani ( 1997 ) computed the evolution of the grbs rate density from  mergers in a model based on the observationally determined history of cosmic star formation and in a model derived from detailed galaxy evolution .",
    "totani assumed a distribution of merging times @xmath13 for  systems  yr . ] .",
    "we go a step further by adopting for all galaxies exponentially decreasing star formation rates ( sfr ) with different timescales depending on galaxy morphology (  sandage 1986 ) .",
    "we apply the distribution of @xmath14 from model b of portegies zwart & yungelson ( 1998 , henceforth pzy98 ) which provides the best fit to the expected birthrate and orbital parameters of the galactic population of high - mass binary pulsars .",
    "the annual  birthrate is proportional to the sfr in the galaxy @xmath15  where @xmath16 is the timescale for star formation .",
    "the sfr adopted is a decreasing exponential , which appears when the sfr is supposed to be proportional to the gas content without taking into account the gas ejected by stars ( e.g.  bruzual & charlot 1993 ) : @xmath17 where the age of the galaxy is given by @xmath18 and @xmath19the time at which the galaxy was formed . at any time @xmath20 the  merger rate",
    "@xmath21 has a contribution from systems that are formed at different epochs @xmath22 in the history of that galaxy .",
    "it can thus be expressed as a convolution integral of the birthrate of stars @xmath23  and the distribution of merging times @xmath24 : @xmath25    the results of the population synthesis computations give @xmath24and the normalization coefficient @xmath26 . the function @xmath24from pzy98 is approximated by a gaussian with @xmath27 as a parameter , the maximum at @xmath28 and with @xmath29=1 ( @xmath30  is the age of the galaxy at @xmath31 ) .",
    "we assume that the distribution function @xmath24 , normalized to unity , is time - independent and the same for all galaxies .",
    "for the normalization of @xmath21  we require that in a reference galaxy similar to the milky way ( type sb , @xmath32 , with a current astration rate of @xmath33)the current rate of  mergers is @xmath34 , which is the merger rate obtained for the galaxy by pzy98 .    for simplicity , we split the hubble sequence into three types of galaxies : e to so , sa to sb and sc to sd . for our selected mixture of hubble types , two sets of characteristic star formation timescales are used ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "this parameterization is rather simplistic ; the fraction of e / s0 galaxies may differ considerably from 20% ( dressler 1980 ) and the star formation history in spirals of the same morphological type may be a function of their mass ( gallagher 1984 ) . if indeed most stars in the universe formed in dwarf star - burst galaxies (  babul & ferguson 1996 ) at @xmath35 , this may affect our results considerably .",
    "star formation is assumed to occur continuously according to eq .",
    "[ expdec ] in all galaxies .",
    "we also investigate the case of an initial burst of star formation during the first gyr in e - so galaxies and no star formation thereafter .",
    "the latter models are denoted as sets  1b and  2b .",
    "lrrcc type & & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + & set  1 & set  2 & & [ @xmath38 + e - so & 1 & 1 & 20 % & 10 + sa - sb & 4 & 6 & 40 % & 5 + sc - sd & 10 & 15 & 40 % & 2 +    the comoving rate density can be related to @xmath39 via the b - band luminosity density from the universe @xmath40 ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ) where @xmath41 : @xmath42 here the summation is taken over all morphological types and @xmath36 is the contribution of each type of galaxy to the b - band luminosity of the universe , @xmath43 is in solar units ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the comoving rate density depends on the cosmological parameters @xmath44 and on the redshift of formation @xmath45 , via the relation for the age of galaxies relative to redshift : @xmath46 .",
    "we consider two cosmological models with @xmath47 and no vacuum energy : @xmath48 and ( 0.75 ,  0.2 ) for which @xmath30=12.16 and 9.92  gyr , respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows the redshift dependence of @xmath0 for several of our models .",
    "we normalize the merger rate density to unity at @xmath49=0 .",
    "the gray shaded area demonstrates that the results are basically consistent with the estimates derived from the grb source distribution as observed by batse ( horack et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the computed merger rate falls roughly in the allowed region for @xmath50 .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior of @xmath0 is easily understood from fig .  2 which shows the relative contribution of galaxies of different types to the merger rate ( for set 1 ) .",
    "at high @xmath49  it is dominated by early - type galaxies with initially a high time - averaged sfr . in set ib ( upper solid line )",
    "the sudden drop at @xmath51 reflects the cessation of star formation in ellipticals in one gyr after formation and the relatively short typical  merger time of @xmath52  gyr ( pzy98 ) .",
    "the more gradual decline of @xmath0  in set 1 reflects the continuous star formation in both elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "comparison of sets 1 with 2 suggests that the evolution of @xmath0  is better described by the models with longer star - formation time scales .",
    "the lower solid line uses the same merger - time function @xmath24 as totani ( 1997 ) .",
    "this model predicts a lower  merger rate .",
    "the upper and lower dashed lines in fig .  1 ( set  2 ) demonstrate the effect of the age of galaxies on the comoving merger rate , i.  e. ; the influence of the cosmological parameters .",
    "figure  2 gives the relative contribution to the  merger - rate density for each selected subclass of galaxies .",
    "the majority of events which are potentially detectable by gravitational - wave observatories ( ligo / virgo ) are located in early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "if grbs originate from  coalescence the dimmest bursts are expected to be hosted in elliptical galaxies .    following the standard procedure ( e.g. horack et al .",
    "1996 ) we compute the number of bursts @xmath53 with a peak flux greater than @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that bursts are standard candles and the intrinsic luminosity does nt evolve .",
    "the spectral form of the burst similar to that observed is adopted : @xmath54 , where @xmath55=350 kev is a characteristic energy . for comparison",
    ", we use the observed integral brightness distribution from the batse 3b catalog in the energy range 50 - 300 kev measured at a timespan of 1024 ms ( meegan et al .",
    "figure 3 shows the expected brightness distributions computed for sets of parameters  1 and  1b , superimposed on the batse data .",
    "the curves are normalized at the peak flux threshold @xmath4=0.4 photons  @xmath5  s@xmath6 .",
    "figure  4 provides the results of a kolmogorov - smirnov test of the batse 3b catalog to the results of our computations .",
    "only data above the peak flux of 0.4 photons  @xmath5  s@xmath6 are used to avoid threshold effects . the highest confidence level ( cl )",
    "is obtained for sets  1 and  1b if the limiting redshift @xmath56 at the peak flux threshold is @xmath57 2.4 and 3.0 respectively . for other values of the star formation timescales and cosmological parameters @xmath56",
    "is found to range from 1.9 to 2.7 ( with a cl@xmath58 ) for the models with a burst of star formation in elliptical galaxies ( models 1b and 2b ) . without an initial burst of star formation @xmath56 ranges from 2.9 to 3.3 .",
    "similar results are found for @xmath55 in the range 300  -  400 kev .",
    "note that for higher limiting redshift , fig.4 shows the existence of other possible fits with a lower cl ( i.e. model 1b , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the primary peak at @xmath60 corresponds to the first change of the slope of the comoving rate density ( fig.1 ) . for higher redshifts ,",
    "the sudden increase of the merger rate would require the same behavior of the batse data for consistency . as a consequence , the secondary peak at @xmath59 , although providing a good fit for peak flux values near the threshold , tends to depart more and more with the data for higher values of @xmath4 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "therefore , the redshift range related to an assumed initial burst of star formation in elliptical galaxies is likely to be beyond the actual limiting redshift for grbs .    finally , it has to be pointed out that the models can hardly reproduce the peak flux values of batse s faintest bursts ( see also totani 1997 ) .",
    "as shown by reichard & mszros ( 1997 ) , this feature results from the assumption that grbs are standard candles .",
    "the computed relative merger rate as a function of redshift is in agreement with the detected rate of @xmath3-ray bursts up - to the limiting redshift of batse . for the models where elliptical galaxies experience an initial burst of star formation the occurrence rate of  coalescence increases suddenly by more than a factor two at a redshift of 2.5 , which is beyond our current detection limit .",
    "the synthetic @xmath61  distribution is compatible with the observations down to the completeness limit of @xmath3-ray catalogues .",
    "the same is true for models based on observationally inferred cosmic star formation history ( see  sahu  1997 ) and for models based on galactic evolution ( totani 1997 ) .",
    "they , however , predict a different behavior if star bursts occur at high @xmath49 .",
    "the absolute value of the  merger rate is found to be @xmath62  100 times larger than the grbs frequency .",
    "escape from this conundrum is obtained if the opening angle of the observed phenomenon is a few degrees , which is consistent with fire - ball models where leptons are converted into bulk barionic motion ( mszros & rees 1992 ) .    if @xmath3-ray bursts indeed originate from  mergers and our model for star formation is correct , interesting implications follow .",
    "the progenitors of bright grbs or bursts at low redshift ( @xmath63 ) most likely belonged to early - type spiral galaxies whereas the progenitors of the dimmest bursts and those at high redshift ( @xmath64 ) were located in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the majority of the bursts of gravitational waves in this model are expected to originate from early - type spiral galaxies . if most stars in the universe formed in dwarf star - burst galaxies , a substantial fraction of the parental population may originate from them .",
    "suggested by current observational data the decline in the star formation rate beyond @xmath65   (  connolly  1997 ) , if real , will show - up as a turn over in the @xmath61  distribution for grbs .    as noticed by tutukov & yungelson ( 1994 ) and confirmed by pzy98 ( their figs . 6 and 8) , space velocities of  binaries",
    "may well exceed escape velocities of dwarf as well as giant galaxies and they may travel up to @xmath7mpc before coalescence .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of the sites of grbs may not be directly associated with star forming regions .",
