    "an analysis of spin dynamics involves calculations of spin correlators .",
    "spin operators do not satisfy the wick theorem , and various methods have been used to still enable the use of perturbative ( diagrammatic ) methods .",
    "one of the approaches is based on the majorana - fermion representation of spin operators .",
    "this approach has a long history and was applied recently to condensed - matter problems .",
    "@xcite    in this approach one introduces three majorana fermions @xmath0 ( per spin ) and expresses the spin ( or pauli ) operators via these fermions : @xmath1 obviously , an analysis of spin - spin correlations based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) requires calculations of a four - fermion correlator . in this note",
    "we show that spin correlators coincide with certain two - fermion ( i.e. , one - particle ) correlators .",
    "we discuss under which conditions this identity may simplify the analysis and discuss its particular applications .",
    "majorana fermions satisfy the anti - commutation relations : @xmath2 for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and are real : @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "these properties ensure that the representation ( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) reproduces the commutation relations of the spin algebra .",
    "an important feature of the representation ( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) is the fact that the spin operators are bilinear ( ` bosonic ' ) combinations of dirac ( annihilation / creation ) fermionic operators .",
    "one may construct the three majorana fermion operators ( for a spin ) out of three different dirac fermions , @xmath7 , each annihilation operator acting in its own two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this ensures the anticommutation relations and the property @xmath8 .",
    "the whole hilbert space is then 8-dimensional .",
    "the dimensionality of the hilbert space may be reduced if two majorana fermions , e.g. @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are constructed as linear combinations of a single dirac fermion @xmath11 and its conjugate @xmath12 : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "another dirac fermion @xmath15 is still needed to construct the third majorana fermion @xmath16 . in this mixed majorana - dirac picture",
    "@xmath17 this ` drone - fermion ' representation was used for the analysis of magnetic systems in the 60s ( see refs .",
    "the whole hilbert space in this representation is 4-dimensional .",
    "depending on the rotational symmetry , this representation may be more convenient than ( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) .",
    "we have described this construction in the hilbert space of two dirac fermions @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "alternatively one can view it as two replicas of the original spin .",
    "indeed , let us label the basis states in the following way : denote the state without @xmath11- and @xmath18-fermions by @xmath19 , and also @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "for the state @xmath23 the first index @xmath24 denotes the spin component , while the second @xmath25 labels the spin copy .",
    "one notices that the spin operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 do not mix the @xmath29- and @xmath30-subspaces , i.e. , they operate in the same way on the two ` copies ' of the spin .",
    "further , one may view the index @xmath25 as an isospin and introduce the respective pauli isospin operators @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , @xmath32 is the ` copy - switching ' operator : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the fermionic operators can be expressed as @xmath35 further , @xmath36 , for any @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , in terms of the fermionic operators we have @xmath38 .",
    "the operator @xmath32 commutes with ` all other ' operators : with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath11 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "a physical hamiltonian depends on the spin operators @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath28 ( and on other degrees of freedom , e.g. , the electrons in the kondo problem ) .",
    "thus the operator @xmath32 commutes with any hamiltonian and we obtain @xmath43 here we have used the fact that @xmath32 is time - independent , commutes with the majorana fermions , and that @xmath44 . for example , we obtain @xmath45\\,[f(t')+f^{\\dag}(t')]\\rangle \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in certain situations the identity ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) may simplify the calculations .",
    "indeed , if the majorana representation ( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) , ( [ eq : majorana_representation_2 ] ) is used for a calculation of spin - spin correlations , a four - fermion correlator needs to be evaluated . in a typical situation ,",
    "the lowest - order contribution is given by a loop - like diagram which involves two fermionic propagators .",
    "a straightforward evaluation of higher - order contributions requires an analysis of the self - energy corrections to these propagators as well as of the vertex corrections .",
    "the use of the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) reduces the task to the evaluation of a single self - energy .    in general , evaluation of this self - energy to all orders in the perturbative expansion",
    "involves complicated diagrams and , in particular , other self - energies and vertex corrections .",
    "hence an involved calculation may still be needed .",
    "nevertheless , the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) may be useful if the needed self - energy part can be estimated reliably , for instance , by calculating the low - order contributions .",
    "we discuss two examples in section  [ sec : example ] .",
    "note also that the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) may be straightforwardly generalized to multi - spin correlators , the evaluation of which then reduces to multi - fermion correlators .",
    "further , in a problem , that involves many spins represented via majorana fermions , ( e.g. , a lattice spin model ) the @xmath32-operators for different spins ( sites ) may be involved in a relation similar to ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) . in this case",
    "their product does not drop out of the calculation ( unlike @xmath44 for one spin ) .",
    "one might be concerned by the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) reduces a correlator of physical quantities to a correlator of `` unphysical '' operators .",
    "another way of expressing this concern is to invoke the gauge symmetry . indeed the majorana representations ( [ eq : majorana_representation_3 ] ) and ( [ eq : majorana_representation_2 ] ) possess the discrete @xmath46-symmetry @xmath47 . as an operator which realizes the symmetry transformation one may choose @xmath48 ( cf",
    ".  ref .",
    "for example , @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the forth majorana fermion allowed in the hilbert space of the representation ( [ eq : majorana_representation_2 ] ) generates the symmetry transformation .",
    "one can as well use as a generator @xmath50 , which just flips the sign of the wave function of the @xmath30-spin , keeping that of the @xmath29-spin intact .",
    "consider now a time - dependent gauge transformation , which transforms a wave function @xmath51 to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "it transforms the operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "thus the operator @xmath32 is now time - dependent and no longer commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , the gauge - transformed hamiltonian reads @xmath57 and the last ( gauge ) term does not commute with @xmath32 .",
    "thus we find that @xmath58 i.e. , the single - fermion correlators are not gauge - invariant .    the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] )",
    "is written in a fixed gauge , in which @xmath59 . in an arbitrary gauge",
    ", the factor @xmath60 should be added on the rhs making the identity gauge - invariant . in path - integral calculations the integration is performed over all configurations ( all gauges ) .",
    "if a saddle - point solution breaks the @xmath46-symmetry ( and hence has a counterpart ) fluctuations which involve switching between two mean - field solutions play an important part and need special attention .",
    "@xcite however , for perturbative calculations around a trivial saddle point , e.g. above the kondo temperature , the ` fixed - gauge ' relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) might be quite useful .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) can simplify calculations , since to evaluate a single - fermion green function one needs only to evaluate a self - energy . in a perturbative regime , when one may restrict oneself to evaluating the lowest - order contribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) simplifies the task .",
    "one example of such a problem is dicussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where continuous measurement of the state of a spin ( qubit ) by a quantum detector is analyzed and the ouput noise of the detector as well as the spin dynamics is studied . a calculation of a spin - spin correlator in the majorana representation requires an evaluation of a two - fermion loop and involves the analysis of two self - energy parts and a vertex correction .",
    "it turns out that the vertex correction is important already in the lowest order and may even cancel one of the self - energy contributions .",
    "this fact may be understood and the calculations are considerably simplified if the relation  ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) is invoked .",
    "the obtained result coincides with an alternative calculation , in which instead of using the majorana representation to enable the use of the wick theorem one follows the dynamics of the spin directly .",
    "this approach  @xcite may be useful if the problem involves only a small number of spins ( or other ` non - wick ' degrees of freedom ) .",
    "here we consider another example : the dissipative dynamics of a spin coupled to an environment , for instance , the spin - boson model .",
    "consider the case of a purely transverse coupling : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a fluctuating bosonic observable of the bath , whose hamiltonian @xmath63 determines the statistics of fluctuations .",
    "we consider gaussian , but not necessarily equilibrium , fluctuations .",
    "using the keldysh technique we perform a calculation considering the bath - spin coupling ( the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hspin - bath ] ) ) as a perturbation .",
    "below we use the notations of ref .",
    "let us introduce the matrix green function of the bath : @xmath64 its keldysh component @xmath65 and the difference between the retarded and advanced components @xmath66 are related to the symmetrized and antisymmetrized correlators : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in equilibrium",
    "they are related by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem : @xmath70 . here",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , for the majorana fermion @xmath73 we define @xmath74 .",
    "the bare green functions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for the @xmath11-fermion we use the bogolubov - nambu spinors @xmath77 and @xmath78 and define a matrix @xmath79 .",
    "calculation of the spin propagators ( in a stationary state ) reduces due to the relation ( [ eq : bubble_to_line_reduction ] ) to the evaluation of the fermion green functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these functions can be found from the the dyson ( kinetic ) equations : @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the self - energies .",
    "all the quantities in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dyson_psi ] ) are @xmath86 matrices ( with the nambu and keldysh components ) . in the frequency domain the operator @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 while for @xmath89 we obtain @xmath90 we disregard infinitesimal imaginary terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g_psi_0 ] , [ eq : g_eta_0 ] ) since they are superseded by the self - energy parts in eqs .",

    "the lowest - order contributions to the self - energies @xmath91 are shown in fig .",
