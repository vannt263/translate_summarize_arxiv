    "considerable attention during the last decade has been devoted to the investigation of systems with long - range interactions . in particular ,",
    "the interest in films and quasi - two - dimensional systems have attracted attention mainly due to their technological applications as , for example , in electronics , data storage , catalysis in the case of metal - on - metal films , biotechnology , and pharmacology in the case of molecular films .",
    "the magnetic size unit and its thermal stability are essential points to be considered in order to obtain a good performance in magneto - optical recording@xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of these films depend on the subtle interplay between the long - range antiferromagnetic dipolar interaction , the short - range rotational invariant exchange , and the magnetic surface anisotropy .",
    "the presence of antiferromagnetic domains ( af ) was observed in epitaxial thin films by the polarization - dependent x - ray magnetic linear dichroism spectra microscopy@xcite .",
    "a possible intrinsic mechanism leading to af domains is the competition between anisotropy and dipolar interaction@xcite .    in two - dimensional lattices and for spins with rotational symmetry",
    ", long - range order does not occur at any finite temperature , for quantum and classical models with short - range interactions@xcite .",
    "that is the case when only short - range exchange interactions are present , for the xy and heisenberg models , for example .",
    "for all real systems there is a long - range dipolar interaction , with the important property that it breaks the symmetry between out - of - plane orientation of the spins and the in - plane orientation of the spins in the ordered state .",
    "the presence of dipolar interactions in systems with rotational symmetry ( exchange ) may stabilize long - range order at finite temperatures , for both classical and quantum models@xcite .",
    "the competition between long - range antiferromagnetic dipolar and short - range ferromagnetic exchange interactions in two - dimensional uniaxial ( ising ) spin systems is responsible for a very rich phenomenological scenario concerning both their equilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite and non - equilibrium dynamic properties@xcite . by means of monte carlo simulations and analytical calculations of the ground state ,",
    "macisaac et al.@xcite studied the two - dimensional spin-@xmath0 ising model with ferromagnetic exchange and antiferromagnetic dipolar interactions , and have shown that for @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the strength of exchange and dipolar interactions , respectively , the antiferromagnetic state is stable . for @xmath13 the af state",
    "becomes unstable with respect to the formation of striped domain structures , i.e. , to state configurations with spins aligned along a particular axis forming a ferromagnetic stripe of constant width @xmath14 , forming a superlattice in the direction perpendicular to the stripes .",
    "monte carlo results @xcite at low temperatures give further support to this proposal , at least for intermediate values of @xmath5 .",
    "there are few numerical results concerning the equilibrium statistical mechanics of quantum models with competitive exchange and dipolar interactions in two - dimensional lattices@xcite .",
    "the two dimensional antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model has been investigated by many authors to explain , for example , the magnetic mechanism of high @xmath6 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations are believed to play an important role in the superconductivity of the cuprates@xcite , such as la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 , which is well described by a quasi - two - dimensional quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg af model .",
    "chandra and doucot@xcite have studied the square - lattice heisenberg model at @xmath9 with next - nearest - exchange coupling and suggested that the af order is destroyed due to the competition between the nearest and next - nearest exchange interactions .",
    "although frustration effects are very effective to destroy the af order in general , they may not be effective in high @xmath6 materials , considering the extended nature of the holes which destroy the af order .",
    "a good example of quasi - two - dimensional af materials in which the dipolar interaction ( with presence of frustration ) is comparable to the exchange coupling are the so called high-@xmath6 superconductors rba@xmath15cu@xmath17o@xmath18 ( where @xmath19 stands for rare earth)@xcite .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , the double - time green s function ( gf ) theory@xcite is both a convenient and an effective theoretical framework for interpretation and forecasting of various characteristics of matter at all temperatures .",
    "the development of approximation schemes for the gf approach has focused on decoupling their equations of motion .",
    "this decoupling is usually chosen for convenience or for reasons which are essentially _ ad hoc_. the consistency of the basic decoupling approximation with relevant operator identities is not always assured .",
    "several first - order decoupling have been proposed in the literature : firstly , the random phase approximation ( rpa ) was applied to the quantum spin-@xmath0 heisenberg ferromagnetic@xcite , and extended to include a long - range interaction @xmath20 , which depends on the distance @xmath21 between spins as an inverse power law @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( dimension)21,22,23 . this rpa decoupling predicts the absence of magnetic order in finite temperature and low - dimensionality ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath25 , in accordance with the generalized mermin and wagner theorem@xcite .",
    "the quantitative results of the phase diagram in the ( @xmath26 ) plane in the @xmath27 region obtained by rpa @xcite are in accordance with quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the results of the competition between the exchange and dipolar interactions in the two - dimensional quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg model . in sec .",
    "ii , the model is presented and treated by the double - time gf technique in the rpa decoupling . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the phase diagram in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "conclusions and remarks are summarized in sec .",
    "in order to study the consequences of both quantum effects and frustration , we propose here a spin model to describe the destruction of the f order , represented by the following hamiltonian@xmath29where @xmath30 is the spin-@xmath0 operator at site @xmath31 .",
    "the first term , @xmath1 , is the strength of the exchange interaction , and the sum is over all nearest - neighbor pairs , @xmath32 , on a square lattice .",
    "the second term , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the land factor , @xmath35 the bohr magneton , @xmath36 the lattice constant ) , represents a long - ranged dipole - dipole interaction and the sum is over all possible pairs of atoms on the square lattice .",
    "the dipolar interaction tends to align the spins in the f system at low temperatures ( @xmath37 ) , while the exchange interaction ( antiferromagnetic , @xmath38 ) tends to destroy the long - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "consequently the ground state of a system determined by the dipolar interaction alone differs from the ground state of a system determined by the exchange interaction alone . in the absence of the dipolar interaction ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) , the isotropic heisenberg model is regained and in two - dimensional lattices it does not present long - range order at @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) .",

    "an infinite set of coupled equations is generated .",
    "therefore , an approximation ( decoupling ) is used to obtain the green function .",

    "the key problem of a first - order decoupling procedure is essentially to express the green s function @xmath64 in terms of lower - order green s functions , which enables one to solve the infinite chain of  equations of motion in an approximate way , and that can be expressed in the following form : @xmath65    using the decoupling ( 6 ) in eq .",

( 4 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) , we obtain the correlation function @xmath77 ; for spin @xmath78 we have @xmath79 and , therefore , the magnetization is written in the form : @xmath80 ^{-1}.   \\label{13}\\ ] ]",

    "numerical results for @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the parameter @xmath5 is a measure of the strengthen of the frustration ; therefore , long - range order decreases as @xmath5 increases .",

    "the point @xmath99 corresponds the to kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , and with the presence of the af nearest - neighbor interaction the critical temperature vanishes at @xmath100 . for @xmath101 ,",

    "we observe that @xmath102 is null when we reach the critical value @xmath103 .",
