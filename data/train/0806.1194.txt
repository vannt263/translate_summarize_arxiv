    "<S> wormholes allowed by the general theory of relativity that are simultaneously traversable by humanoid travelers are subject to severe constraints from quantum field theory , particularly the so - called quantum inequalities , here slightly extended . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , self - collapse of such wormholes can only be prevented by the use of  exotic matter , \" which , being rather problematical , should be used in only minimal quantities . </S>",
    "<S> however , making the layer of exotic matter arbitrarily thin leads to other problems , such as the need for extreme fine - tuning . </S>",
    "<S> this paper discusses a class of wormhole geometries that strike a balance between reducing the proper distance across the exotic region and the degree of fine - tuning required to achieve this reduction . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the degree of fine - tuning appears to be a generic feature of the type of wormhole discussed . </S>",
    "<S> no particular restriction is placed on the throat size , even though the proper thickness of the exotic region can indeed be quite small . </S>",
    "<S> various traversability criteria are shown to be met .    </S>",
