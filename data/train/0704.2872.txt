    "hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) , i.e. stars moving with speeds sufficient to escape the gravitational field of the milky way ( mw ) , were first recognized by hills ( 1988 ) as an unavoidable byproduct of the presence of a massive black hole in the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "we now know of seven hvss in the mw halo traveling with galactic rest - frame velocities @xmath1 in the range between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( brown et al .",
    "2005 , 2006a , b ; hirsch et al .",
    "2005 ; edelmann et al .",
    "most are probably b - type main sequence halo stars with galactocentric distances of 50 - 100 kpc , and have travel times from the gc consistent with their lifetimes . only a close encounter with a relativistic potential well",
    "can accelerate a 3 - 4 @xmath4 star to such extreme velocities , and at least three different ejection mechanisms from the dense stellar cusp around sgr a@xmath0 , the massive black hole in the gc , have been proposed :    1 .   the scattering of stars bound to sgr a@xmath0 by an inspiraling intermediate - mass black hole ( `` imbh model '' , yu & tremaine 2003 ; levin 2006 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2006 ; sesana et al .",
    "2006 , 2007b ) .",
    "2 .   the tidal breakup of a tight stellar binary by sgr a@xmath0 ( hereinafter the `` tb model '' ) .",
    "this interaction leads to the capture of one star and the high - speed ejection of its companion ( hills 1988 ; yu & tremaine 2003 ; gualandris etal . 2005 ; ginsburg & loeb 2006 ; bromley et al .",
    "3 .   the scattering of ambient stars by a cluster of stellar - mass black holes that have segregated around sgr a@xmath0 ( oleary & loeb 2006 ; miralda - escud & gould 2000 ; hereinafter the `` bhc '' model ) .    in theory , the observed frequency , spectral properties , and spatial and velocity distributions of hvss should all shed light on the ejection mechanism and the stellar environment around sgr a@xmath0 . in practice , however , different scenarios can reproduce the inferred rate of removal from the gc simply by changing , within the observational constraints , the stellar mass function and/or the fraction of stellar binaries .",
    "travel times estimates for the known hvss are spread uniformly between 30 and 160 myr , and there is as yet no evidence for a burst of hvss from the gc ( brown et al .",
    "both models tb and bhc predict hvss to be expelled isotropically at an approximately constant rate , while in model imbh hvss are ejected preferentially within the orbital plane of the black hole pair in a short burst lasting a few myr ( levin 2006 ; sesana et al .",
    "2006 , 2007a , 2007b ) . even in the latter case , however , the observed hvs population would plausibly be produced by a series of imbh inspiral events ( at a rate that could be as high as 10@xmath5 yr@xmath6 , see portegies zwart et al .",
    "2006 ) with randomly oriented orbital planes .",
    "hvss would then be distributed isotropically in the halo of the mw , and the imprint of a single burst on their spatial distribution would be hardly recognizable .    in this _",
    "letter _ we use numerical simulations of the propagation of hvss in the milky way halo to compare the radial and velocity distributions predicted by the three models to the brown ( 2006a , b ) sample of unbound and bound hvss .",
    "hvss are assumed to be ejected from the gc at a steady , arbitrary rate , and their velocities are obtained as follows :    1 .   in model imbh , hvss",
    "are produced according to the velocity distribution of scattered stars found in scattering experiments ( sesana et al .",
    "2006 , 2007b ) . in sesana",
    "2007b , we study the inspiral of an imbh onto a mbh surrounded by a cusp of bound stars .",
    "motivated by recent n - body simulations ( matsubayashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , we assume that the imbh starts to eject stars when the total stellar mass inside the binary semimajor axis @xmath7 is @xmath8 , the mass of the secondary . for sgr a@xmath0 ,",
    "this translates into @xmath9 pc .",
    "we further assume a black hole binary mass ratio @xmath10 , an initial orbital eccentricity @xmath11 , and a stellar cusp ( bound to sgr a@xmath0 ) with density profile @xmath12 . the imbh is found to stall after loss  cone depletion at @xmath13 pc .",
    "while the ejection rate depends on the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , neither the binary mass ratio nor its eccentricity have a large effect on the average ejection velocity ( see also fig",
    ". 6 of sesana 2006 ) .",
    "we checked that either assuming @xmath16 or @xmath17 , does not affect significantly the predicted velocity distribution .",
    "as the ejection velocity in a scattering event is a function of binary separation , the velocity distribution used here is averaged during the entire shrinking phase of the binary : the imbh decays fast at large separations ( where stars gain relatively little energy after an encounter ) , and ejects stars at higher and higher speeds as it approaches the hardening radius .",
    "2 .   for models",
    "tb invoking the tidal break - up of stellar binaries by a close encounter with sgr a@xmath0 , we use the results of the scattering experiments performed by bromley ( 2006 ) . there ,",
    "randomly oriented circular binaries are launched towards sgr a@xmath0 from a distance of several thousands au at an initial approach speed of 250 @xmath18 .",
    "the high - speed ejection of a binary member depends on the binary semi - major axis @xmath19 , the closest approach distance between the binary and the hole , @xmath20 , and the masses of the three bodies .",
    "a gaussian distribution of ejection speeds with 20% dispersion around the mean provides a reasonable characterization of the numerical results .",
    "we use this simple gaussian model , assuming both a flat distribution in log @xmath19 ( heacox 1998 , hereinafter tbf model ) , and a lognormal distribution in @xmath19 ( duquennoy & major 1991 , hereinafter tbln model ) .",
    "we randomly sample the closest approach distance @xmath20 between 1 and 700 au , and neglect any preference in the ejection of either members of the binary .",
    "both binary member masses are generated according to a salpeter initial mass function in the range 1 - 15 @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   finally ,",
    "in model bhc , hvss are generated from the conservative distribution of oleary & loeb ( 2006 , see their figure 1 ) , including encounters that results in physical star - black holes collisions .",
    "this is because the typical relative speed of the stars and the black holes is much larger than the surface escape velocity of the star : such encounters do not lead to coalescences and could also result in hvss .",
    "all black holes have a mass of @xmath21 , are distributed isotropically , and follow a cuspy density profile with slope @xmath22 ( oleary & loeb 2006 ) .",
    "compared to model imbh in which a single scatterer slowly sinks inward , in model bhc many scattering centers are present at any given time around sgr a@xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of stellar ejection velocities at infinite distance from sgr a@xmath0 ( and in the absence of other gravitational sources ) is shown in figure [ fig1 ] for the three scenarios discussed above , in the range @xmath23 .",
    "mechanism imbh clearly produces a more numerous population of high - speed events with @xmath24 compared to mechanisms tb and bhc .",
    "note that , while in both models imbh and bhc the ejection velocity is independent of stellar mass ( for model bhc this is actually true only as long as the star is lighter than the scattering hole ) , in model tb the ejection velocity of the primary ( secondary ) component of a @xmath25 stellar binary scales as @xmath26 [ @xmath27 ( hills 1988 ) .",
    "to generate a simulated catalog of hvss in the mw halo , we sample the distributions in figure [ fig1 ] and integrate the orbits of ejected stars in a spherically symmetric potential using the fourth - order runge - kutta routine dopri5 ( dormand & prince 1978 ) .",
    "the fractional tolerated error , in position and velocity of the star , is set to @xmath28 per step , allowing a ( fractional ) total energy conservation accuracy @xmath29 .    the galactic potential ,",
    "the main - sequence lifetime of the stars @xmath30 , and its ejection time relative to the present all determine the distribution of observable velocities as a function of galactocentric distance . for each star",
    "we randomly generate a time @xmath31 since ejection between zero and the main sequence lifetime @xmath30 , integrate its orbit for a time @xmath31 , and then store its final distance and velocity . while stars ejected with lower speeds can not reach large distances within a time @xmath32 and will only populate the inner halo , the high - velocity tail can reach more distant regions of the mw within the stellar main - sequence lifetime ( bromley 2006 ) .",
    "stars are assumed to be injected in the gc at a constant rate according to a salpeter imf , @xmath33 .",
    "the scattering rate of stars having mass between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is then given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the characteristic timescale between encounters .",
    "since the orbits of stars of mass @xmath34 are only followed for at most a main - sequence timescale @xmath38 , we must normalize the total number of events according to @xmath39 the number of stars ejected in the same mass interval is then @xmath40 , where the dimensionless function @xmath41 takes into account the mass dependence of the ejection mechanism ( as in model tb the ejection probability is larger for low - mass binaries , hills 1988 ) . note that , in all models , the stellar lifetime introduces an explicit dependence on stellar mass in the spatial distribution of observable hvss , since more massive stars need higher ejection speeds to reach large galactocentric distances .    to bracket the uncertainties in the mw potential , we have used 5 different models for the mass distribution in the galaxy .",
    "one is the single - component default model used by bromley et al .",
    "2006 ( hereinafter potential bdef ) , a cored power - law @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the central density , and the core radius is @xmath44 pc .",
    "the other four are multi - component models , formed by a power - law stellar bulge , an exponential disk , and an nfw ( navarro , frank & white 1997 ) dark matter halo . in model wda , the disk and halo are chosen according to model mwa of widrow & dubinsky ( 2005 ) , and the bulge mass is set to @xmath45 . in models db2d and db4d , disk and halo are chosen according to models 2d and 4d of dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) , and the bulge mass is @xmath46 .",
    "finally , a variant of model wda is constructed where the disk has the same mass but a smaller scale length @xmath47 kpc , and the halo has a larger scale length ( 19 kpc ) and is more massive ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "such model , termed  deep \" , is characterized by a large local escape speed . for simplicity , in all models",
    "the bulge is spherically symmetric and the disk mass is added as a spherical component to the bulge and halo .",
    "the disk contribution to the potential is significant only in models db2d and deep , and only in the inner 3 - 8 kpc . table [ tab1 ] list several observable quantities for the five assumed mw mass distributions .",
    "the potential gets shallower from top to bottom , with extreme models deep and db4d bracketing the range allowed by the observations .",
    "combining the different ejection mechanisms with the mw gravitational potentials yields a total of twenty different models for the distributions observable speeds and distances of hvss .",
    "these are shown in figures [ fig2amod ] and [ fig2apot ] for stars with @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc .",
    "the velocity distribution shows a broad peak for @xmath51 , and different ejection scenarios are clearly recognizable .",
    "for the same ejection mechanism , the effect of the different mw potentials is relatively weak ( fig .",
    "[ fig2apot ] , left panel ) .",
    "the distribution of galactocentric distances is instead quite sensitive to both the ejection and the potential model , particularly for stars within 100 kpc of the gc .",
    "note that a steady rate of ejection of hvss from the gc would result in a flat @xmath52 curve .",
    "the excess at @xmath53 kpc is due to the many low - mass stars that are scattered into the halo on bound orbits .",
    ".the five different models of mw mass distribution discussed in the text .",
    "the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , respectively , the mass enclosed in 10 pc in units of @xmath56 , the mass enclosed in 100 kpc in units of @xmath57 , the circular velocity at 8 kpc in @xmath18 , the oort constants , the escape velocity from sgr a@xmath0 in @xmath18 ; the escape velocity at 8 kpc in @xmath18 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     slowly - moving , short - lived massive stars can only populate the inner halo , and ejection mechanisms like tbln and tbf that produce many low - speed events will generate a spatial distribution with an  excess \" of stars within @xmath5850 kpc of the gc .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the mean observable speed of 3 - 4 @xmath4 hvss as a function of galactocentric distance .",
    "this is an increasing function of @xmath59 because of stellar lifetime effects .",
    "model imbh appears to produce an excess of extremely fast - moving stars compared to the observations .",
    "we stress that this result does not depend on the values assumed for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , we tested that increasing @xmath14 and/or decreasing @xmath15 do not suppress the high velocity tail .",
    "hvss are in principle a powerful probe of the mw dark matter halo .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] shows that , for any given ejection mechanism , the currently available statistics is far too low to constrain the mw potential ( cf .",
    "bromley 2006 ) .",
    "the situation will change dramatically with future astrometric ( gnedin 2005 ) and deep wide - field surveys . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we focus here on _ large synoptic survey telescope _",
    "( _ lsst _ , claver et al . 2004 ) .",
    "lsst _ is being designed to survey an area of 20,000 deg@xmath60 with 15 secs pointings , down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath61 . to assess the impact of the _ lsst _ on studies of hvss",
    ", we first assign a survey volume to the theoretical models discussed in the previous sections and use the brown et al . sample to estimate the expected number of hvss detectable by the _",
    "lsst_. assuming that the model distributions do indeed describe the parent population of hvss , we then extract randomly from each of them a mock catalogue of hvss .",
    "we then apply k - s statistics to quantify the ability of the _ lsst _ to distinguish between different scenarios .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we show in figure [ fig2amod ] the distribution of observable speeds and distances predicted by the different ejection scenarios , for all @xmath62 and @xmath50 kpc hvss in the _ lsst _ survey volume . at a magnitude limit of @xmath61 ,",
    "a @xmath63 star can be detected at a distance of @xmath64 kpc , and the distance distributions drop rapidly at larger distances . assuming a salpeter initial mass function and ejection model tbln in a db2d potential , we estimate that the _ lsst _ should detect @xmath65 hvss with @xmath66 , in the mass range @xmath67 .",
    "we find that the detection of @xmath68 hvss may be enough to identify unambiguously the ejection model _ and _ the galactic potential .",
