    "our analysis reveals previously unchartered behaviour .",
    "only two sublimits are intuitively obvious : the first ( iiib , @xmath328 ) arises when the reaction is so fast that advection can be neglected , so that the front speed is the familiar bare speed , dimensionally @xmath329 , obtained in the absence of flow .",
    "the other obvious sublimit ( ia , @xmath330 ) arises when the reaction is slow enough that the front spreads across many flow cells ; in this case , homogenisation results which describe the combined effect of advection and diffusion through an effective diffusivity @xmath123 apply , and the front speed is estimated by replacing @xmath14 by @xmath331 in the bare speed to obtain @xmath332 .",
    "these two explicit expressions provide estimates for @xmath18 for extreme values of @xmath5 , but since their ratio @xmath333 is asymptotically large , they provide little indication ( bar a lower bound for @xmath334 ) for the front speed for @xmath1 away from these extremes . our asymptotic results , in contrast ,",
    "pinpoint the behaviour of @xmath18 .",
    "they describe , in particular , the very slow growth of @xmath18 with @xmath1 in regime iib / iiia where , to the lowest order ignoring logarithmic corrections , @xmath335 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "this scaling , proposed heuristically in @xcite , is here derived in two ways , from the integral eigenvalue problem of regime ii and from the optimisation approach of regime iii .",
    "it can be traced to the behaviour of fluid - particle motion near the cell corners : the front in this regime is controlled by motion along the separatrix which is fast along most of the separatrix but very slow near the corners since these are stagnation points . as a result , the motion of particles determining the front is akin to a random walk on the lattice of stagnation points . it is not difficult to show that the relevant waiting time , namely the typical time by diffusion to move particles across the stagnation point scales like @xmath209 , thus explaining the form of @xmath18 .",
    "a more complex dependence on @xmath209 holds in the entire regime ii , reflecting the same physical phenomenon although complicated by a non - trivial behaviour between stagnation points .",
    "we conclude by noting that most of the rigorous work on the asymptotics of fkpp front speed focuses on a single large parameter , namely the pclet number , assuming either that @xmath336 @xcite or that @xmath337 @xcite .",
    "our analysis and numerical work demonstrates the richness of the problem when the damkhler number is allowed instead to take a broad range of value .",
