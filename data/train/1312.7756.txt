    "the possibility of dibaryon states was first proposed by f. j. dyson and n. xuong  @xcite in 1964 . however , this topic got considerable attention only after r. jaffe s prediction of the @xmath4 particle in 1977  @xcite .",
    "all quark models , including lattice qcd calculations , predict that in addition to @xmath5 mesons and @xmath6 baryons , there should be multiquark systems @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , quark - gluon hybrids @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and glueballs  @xcite .",
    "a worldwide theoretical and experimental effort to search for dibaryon states with and without strangeness lasts for a long time .",
    "the @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 dibaryon , which is hard to be explained by quark models  @xcite , was claimed by experiments in 1993 and disappeared years later  @xcite .",
    "our group showed that the @xmath12 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 is a tightly bound six - quark system rather than a loosely bound nucleus - like system of two @xmath18s  @xcite .",
    "an @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath22 state was proposed as a high strangeness dibaryon candidate  @xcite .",
    "kopeliovich predicted high strangeness dibaryons , such as the di-@xmath23 with @xmath24 , using the flavor @xmath25 skyrmion model  @xcite .",
    "zhang @xmath26 suggested to search for the di-@xmath23 in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "la france and lomon predicted a deuteron - like dibaryon resonance using @xmath27-matrix theory  @xcite and measurements at saclay seem to offer experimental support for its existence  @xcite . despite numerous claims ,",
    "there has not been a well - established experimental candidate for these dibaryon states .",
    "however , the interest in the @xmath4 particle have been revived recently by lattice qcd calculations of different collaborations , nplqcd  @xcite and halqcd  @xcite .",
    "these two groups reported that the @xmath4 particle is indeed a bound state at pion mass larger than the physical one .",
    "then , carames and valcarce examined the @xmath4 particle within a chiral constituent quark model and obtained a bound @xmath4 dibaryon with @xmath28 mev  @xcite .",
    "recently , a pronounced resonance structure has been observed in @xmath29 collisions leading to two - pion production in the reaction @xmath3 , which suggests the presence of an @xmath30 subthreshold @xmath0 resonance , called henceforth @xmath17 , with a resonance mass @xmath31 gev and a width @xmath32 mev  @xcite .",
    "the relatively large binding energy of this state shows that it is much closer to these interesting multiquark states than a loosely bound system such as the deuteron .",
    "however , the width is remarkably smaller than that given by a naive model estimate @xmath33 , where @xmath34 mev .    according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in addition to @xmath17 , one should also have a state with mirrored quantum numbers for spin and isospin , @xmath35 @xmath36 , called @xmath37 in ref .",
    "recently , m. bashkanov @xmath26 further pointed out that the observation of the @xmath17 resonance state raises the possibility of producing other novel six - quark dibaryon configurations allowed by qcd and showed the @xmath37 state could be regarded as manifestations of hidden - color six - quark configurations in qcd  @xcite . to what extent such kind spin - isospin",
    "symmetry exists in hadron spectroscopy ?",
    "it should be an interesting check of the goldstone boson exchange model where the isospin triplet @xmath38 exchange interaction has the spin - isospin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , many former quark model calculations showed that the mass of @xmath30 @xmath0 state was much smaller than that of @xmath36 @xmath0 state because these models include the effective gluon exchange . in the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm ) the @xmath30 state",
    "is bound by 320 mev , while the @xmath39 state is bound by only 48 mev  @xcite ; by using the standard confinement and one gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction model , maltman found the @xmath30 state is bound by 260 mev , while the @xmath36 state is bound by only 30 mev  @xcite .",
    "both results are in qualitative agreement with the results of oka and yazaki  @xcite , cvetic  @xcite , valcarce  @xcite and z. y. zhang  @xcite .",
    "this situation calls for a more quantitative study of the @xmath36 state .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is widely accepted as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction . however , the direct use of qcd for low - energy hadronic interactions , for example , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath40 ) interaction , is still difficult because of the nonperturbative complications of qcd .",
    "qcd - inspired quark models are still the main approach to study the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the most common used quark model in the study of baryon - baryon interaction is the chiral quark model ( chqm )  @xcite , in which the @xmath41 meson is indispensable to provide the intermediate - range attraction .",
    "another quark - model approach is the quark delocalization color screening model ( qdcsm )  @xcite , which has been developed with the aim of understanding the well - known similarities between nuclear and molecular forces despite the obvious energy and length scale differences . in this model ,",
    "the intermediate - range attraction is achieved by the quark delocalization , which is like the electron percolation in the molecules .",
    "the color screening is needed to make the quark delocalization possible and it might be an effective description of the hidden color channel coupling  @xcite . therefore to study",
    "the @xmath37 state with qdcsm is especially interesting because its special relation to the hidden color channel effect .",
    "we have showed both qdcsm and chqm give a good description of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 wave phase shifts of @xmath40 @xmath44 scattering and the properties of deuteron  @xcite despite the difference of the mechanism of the @xmath40 intermediate range attraction .",
    "recently , the @xmath17 resonance in @xmath40 @xmath43-wave scattering were re - studied with the qdcsm and chqm  @xcite .",
    "both models give an @xmath30 @xmath0 resonances reasonable well .",
    "therefore we will use these two models to calculate the mass and decay width of the @xmath37 dibaryon , and compare the result with the @xmath17 resonance , to check if there is a @xmath37 dibaryon state .",
    "the hidden color channels are added to the chqm to check their effect in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "a brief introduction of two quark models is given in section ii .",
    "section iii devotes to the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the last section is a summary .",
    "the salamanca version of chqm is chosen as the representative of the chiral quark models .",
    "it has been successfully applied to hadron spectroscopy and @xmath40 interaction .",
    "the model details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . only the hamiltonian and parameters are given here .",
    "the chqm hamiltonian in the nucleon - nucleon sector is      where @xmath46 is quark tensor operator , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are standard yukawa functions , @xmath50 is the kinetic energy of the center of mass , @xmath51 is the chiral coupling constant , determined as usual from the @xmath38-nucleon coupling constant .",
    "all other symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "the parameters of chqm are given in table [ parameters ] .",
    "the model and its extension were discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "its hamiltonian has the same form as eq.(1 ) , but without @xmath41 meson exchange and a phenomenological color screening confinement potential is used , @xmath52+v^{c , ls}_{ij } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "f(r_{ij } ) & = &   \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll }   r_{ij}^2 &   \\qquad \\mbox{if } i , j\\mbox { occur in the same } \\\\   & \\qquad \\mbox{baryon orbit } , \\\\   \\frac{1 - e^{-\\mu r_{ij}^2 } } { \\mu } & \\qquad   \\mbox{if } i , j\\mbox { occur in different } \\\\   & \\qquad \\mbox{baryon orbits}.   \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath53 is the color screening constant to be determined by fitting the deuteron mass in this model . the quark delocalization in qdcsm",
    "is realized by allowing the single particle orbital wave function of qdcsm as a linear combination of left and right gaussian , the single particle orbital wave functions in the ordinary quark cluster model , @xmath54 the mixing parameter @xmath55 is not an adjusted one but determined variationally by the dynamics of the multi - quark system itself .",
    "this assumption allows the multi - quark system to choose its favorable configuration in the interacting process .",
    "it has been used to explain the cross - over transition between hadron phase and quark - gluon plasma phase  @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are fixed as follows : the @xmath56-quark mass difference is neglected and @xmath57=@xmath58 is assumed to be exactly @xmath59 of the nucleon mass , namely @xmath57=@xmath58=@xmath60 mev .",
    "the @xmath38 mass takes the experimental value .",
    "the @xmath61 takes the same values as in ref.@xcite , namely @xmath61=4.2 @xmath62 .",
    "the chiral coupling constant @xmath63 is determined from the @xmath64 coupling constant as usual .",
    "the other parameters b , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are determined by fitting the nucleon and @xmath18 masses and the stability of nucleon size .",
    "all parameters used are listed in table [ parameters ] . in order to compare the intermediate - range attraction mechanism , the @xmath41 meson exchange in chqm and quark delocalization and color screening in qdcsm , the same values of parameters :",
    "@xmath68 are used for these two models .",
    "thus , these two models have exactly the same contributions from one - gluon - exchange and @xmath38 exchange .",
    "the only difference of the two models is coming from the short and intermediate - range part , @xmath41 exchange for chqm , quark delocalization and color screening for qdcsm .",
    ".parameters of quark models [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ be30 ]    first , from table [ be03 ] and table [ be30 ] , we can see that both the individual @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath0 are bound in qdcsm and chqm , which indicates that the attraction between two @xmath18s is strong enough to bind two @xmath18s together .",
    "however , the mass of @xmath1 state is smaller than that of @xmath2 state , due to the oge interaction as mentioned above .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the results of our previous study  @xcite , oka and yazaki  @xcite , cvetic  @xcite , valcarce  @xcite and z. y. zhang  @xcite as mentioned above .",
    "for the decay width , take the qdcsm results as an example , the inelastic width @xmath69 of @xmath1 state is 79 mev smaller than that of @xmath2 state , because of the smaller mass of @xmath1 state .",
    "although the @xmath1 state can decay to @xmath70 state , the decay width is only 14 mev .",
    "so the total decay width of the @xmath1 @xmath0 is 110 mev , which is still 65 mev smaller than that of the @xmath2 state .",
    "so the mass and width of the @xmath1 state are both smaller than that of the @xmath2 state .",
    "the resonance mass and decay width of the @xmath1 state indicate that this resonance is a promising candidate for the observed isoscalar abc structure recently reported by the celsius - wasa collaboration  @xcite and wasa - at - cosy collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 state is another possible six - quark dibaryon state and it might be observed in proper experiments as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "secondly , the similar results are obtained in chqm . however",
    ", both @xmath1 and @xmath2 states have smaller mass and decay width in qdcsm than in chqm .",
    "our hidden color channel coupling calculation in the @xmath40 scattering shows that the color screening assumed in qdcsm is an effective description of the hidden - color channel coupling effects  @xcite . to check the effect of hidden - color channels coupling in chqm",
    ", the hidden - color channels are added to chqm . for the @xmath1 state",
    ", the six hidden - color channels coupling lowers the chqm resonance mass by 20 mev . for the @xmath2 state ,",
    "the one hidden - color channel coupling lowers the chqm mass by 10 mev . after including the hidden color channel coupling the resonance masses in chqm are closer to that in qdcsm .",
    "so in the @xmath0 system the hidden - color channel coupling effect is also to increase the attraction , which is consistent with our previous conclusion that the hidden - color channel coupling might be responsible for the intermediate - range attraction of @xmath40 interaction  @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we perform a dynamical calculation of the @xmath0 dibaryon candidates with @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the framework of qdcsm and chqm .",
    "our results show that the attractions between two @xmath18s is strong enough to bind two @xmath18s together for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . however , the mass and width of the @xmath1 state are smaller than that of the @xmath2 state due to the oge interaction .",
    "the resonance mass and decay width of the @xmath1 state indicate that this @xmath0 resonance is a promising candidate for the recent observed one in the abc effect .",
    "the @xmath2 @xmath0 is another possible six - quark dibaryon state and it might be observed in proper experiments , such as @xmath71 , which can be done at cosy and jparc  @xcite .    the naive expectation of the spin - isospin symmetry is broken by the effective one gluon exchange between quarks .",
    "the @xmath72 and @xmath37 states searching will be another check of this gluon exchange mechanism and the goldstone boson exchange model .",
    "qdcsm and chqm obtained similar results .",
    "however , the mass and decay width of @xmath1 and @xmath2 dibaryons in qdcsm are smaller than that in chqm . by including the hidden - color channels in chqm ,",
    "the resonance masses are lowered by 10 - 20 mev .",
    "this fact shows once more that the quark delocalization and color screening used in qdcsm might be an effective description of the hidden color channel coupling .",
