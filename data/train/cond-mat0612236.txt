    "recently , ultrathin graphite films including monolayers@xcite and bilayers @xcite have attracted considerable attention because of their novel properties . in single - layer graphene ,",
    "the @xmath0 sublattice to @xmath1 sublattice hopping amplitude vanishes at two inequivalent points @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the edge of the honeycomb lattice brillouin zone ( bz ) ; away from these points , the hopping amplitude grows linearly with the wave vector and has a phase which winds along with the orientation of the wave vector measured from the high - symmetry points .",
    "the band structure of an isolated graphene layer is therefore described at low energies by a two - dimensional massless dirac equation with linear dispersion ; this property gives rise to a half integer quantum hall effect@xcite and to a quantized spin hall effect@xcite and dominates the low - energy physics .",

    "[ fig : bilayer ] modifies this electronic structure in an interesting way.@xcite at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the states localized at the @xmath5 and @xmath1 sites , are repelled from zero energy by interlayer tunneling ; only states localized at @xmath0 and @xmath6 are present at zero energy .",
    "when tunneling is included , the @xmath0 to @xmath6 hopping is a second - order process via a virtual bonding or antibonding state at @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "the chirality of the low - energy bands is therefore doubled .",
    "most intriguingly , an external potential which induces a difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath6 site energies will open up a gap@xcite in the spectrum .",
    "band gaps controlled by applying a gate bias have been studied experimentally using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy@xcite and shubnikov - de haas analysis@xcite of magnetotransport .",
    "this unique property of bilayer graphene has created considerable interest in part because it suggests the possibility of switching the conductance of a graphene bilayer channel over a wide range at a speed which is limited by gate - voltage switching , as illustrated schematically in fig .",

    ", we report on an _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) study of the influence of an external potential difference between the layers on the electronic structure of a graphene bilayer .",
    "we compare our results with the phenomenological tight - binding and continuum model schrdinger - poisson calculations used in previous theoretical analyses.@xcite dft predicts , in agreement with these works , that the external potential difference is strongly screened with a maximum energy gap value of @xmath70.3 ev .",
    "there are , however , quantitative differences .",
    "in particular , the enhanced screening which occurs for weak external potentials is stronger in the dft calculations . in an effort to improve the quantitative agreement ,",
    "we have estimated the influence of crystalline inhomogeneity in a tight - binding model self - consistent hartree calculation .",
    "this effect strengthens intralayer coulomb interactions because the charge is spatially bunched , and therefore increases screening in a hartree calculation , but does not fully account for differences between the two calculations .",

    "the difference between the coulomb energies of the two layers in the presence of an external electric field is closely related to the gate - voltage induced energy gap .",
    "figure [ fig : band](a ) shows the dft energy band structure of bilayer graphene in the absence of an applied external electric field . when @xmath20 ev , the low - energy band dispersion is nearly parabolic at two inequivalent corners , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , of the hexagonal bz , as predicted by the @xmath21-orbital tight - binding and continuum model phenomenologies.@xcite the valence and conduction bands meet at the fermi level .    in the absence of an external electric field , bilayer graphene , like single - layer graphene , is a zero - gap semiconductor . at finite @xmath15 ,",

    "the rate of increase is , however , ten times smaller than estimated in a recent experimental study@xcite of a doped bilayer systems , possibly suggesting significant differences between doped and undoped systems .",
    "the intralayer nearest - neighbor @xmath21-electron hopping amplitude @xmath26 and the interlayer @xmath0-@xmath27 coupling @xmath28 were fitted to reproduce the band dispersion around the @xmath29 points at low energies .",

    "a nonzero value for @xmath28 has a noticeable quantitative influence on the bands .",

    "we have used a gaussian form factor @xmath106 corresponding to @xmath107 , where @xmath108 @xmath109 was obtained by fitting to the dft valence orbitals .",
    "this two - body hamiltonian can be used to account for crystalline inhomogeneity in a graphene bilayer system with arbitrary electronic correlations . to compare with the _ ab initio _ dft calculations , we consider interactions in a mean - field hartree approximation in which the interaction contribution to the single - particle hamiltonian is @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 denote layer and sublattice degrees of freedom . here , @xmath113 where @xmath114 including spin degeneracy and @xmath115 with @xmath116 a triangular lattice reciprocal - lattice vector .",
    "as explained in the introduction , interlayer tunneling in graphene leads to high - energy bands which favor the @xmath4-@xmath1 sites and low - energy bands that favor the @xmath0-@xmath27 sites .",
    "since the low - energy bands respond most strongly to the external potential , we can expect that the charge transfer occurs more strongly on the @xmath0-@xmath27 sites , and that the screening potential should be larger on these sites . instead of a single - interlayer hartree screening potential ,",
    "two hartree potentials for low and high bands must be calculated separately : @xmath117 when only the @xmath118 term is retained in the reciprocal - lattice vector sum , @xmath119 and eq .",

    "our dft calculations of external potential induced gaps in the electronic structure of graphene bilayers confirm the simple picture provided by phenomenological tight - binding models .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations include a number of effects not contained in the model calculations .",
    "for example , the occupied @xmath112 orbitals within each graphene plane , which are neglected in the @xmath21-orbital tight - binding model , will be slightly polarized by the external electric field and contribute to screening . in the dft calculations , not only hartree potentials but also exchange - correlation potentials will be altered by an external electric field and influence the screening process . since the exchange potential is attractive , its contribution to the total potential will lower energies in a layer more as the density is increased .",
    "the exchange potential therefore makes a negative contribution to the screening ratio .",
    "the quantitative discrepancies between the dft and phenomenological model reflect the combination of these and other additional effects contained in the dft calculations , and strong sensitivity to intralayer and interlayer tunneling amplitudes which may not be evaluated with perfect accuracy by dft .",
    "we also note that the low - energy eigenstates in bilayer graphene are coherent combinations of amplitudes on both layers , which implies that interlayer exchange interactions will be substantial .",
    "this kind of effect is absent in the exchange - correlation potentials commonly used in dft .",
    "indeed , it is entirely possible that dft calculations do not predict accurate values for the screening ratio .",
    "we believe that there is strong motivation for capacitive studies of the interlayer screening properties of graphene bilayers using an experimental arrangement similar to that in fig .",
