    "the triangular lattice has gained interest in modern condensed matter physics due to several reasons .",
    "first the triangular lattice continues to be important in the study of frustration effects in spin models , and is a promising candidate for the occurrence of spin - liquid phases@xcite .",
    "then there are organic superconductors like the @xmath5-(bedt - ttf ) materials that may be described by an anisotropic triangular lattice and whose phase diagrams show some resemblance to those of the high-@xmath6 cuprates@xcite .",
    "very recently superconductivity was discovered at critical temperatures of 5k@xcite in na@xmath7coo@xmath8h@xmath0o . in this compound edge - sharing octahedra of coo@xmath0 form two - dimensional layered triangular networks . a one - band hubbard model on the two - dimensional triangular lattice may be the simplest approach to describe the motion of the charge carriers in the layers .    in the cobalt oxides",
    "there are signs of electronic correlations like weak ferromagnetism and high temperature curie behavior of the susceptibility@xcite .",
    "therefore it is natural to ask whether the superconductivity in these materials arises due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "the experimental findings have immediately spurred several theoretical suggestions@xcite that rvb ( resonating valence bond ) superconductivity@xcite might be realized in these materials .",
    "the rvb theories in the framework of the @xmath4-@xmath2-model consider the case of strong on - site repulsion on the co sites . an alternative approach is to start from weak coupling .",
    "a very flexible way to investigate superconductivity arising from weak to moderate electron - electron interactions is to use renormalization group ( rg ) techniques .",
    "modern functional rg studies have proved useful in the analysis of the hubbard model on the two - dimensional square lattice@xcite and give results that are in agreement with experiments and other theoretical approaches . in particular , on the square lattice for densities close to one electron per site , various strong coupling approaches@xcite and weak coupling rg calculations@xcite agree on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the hubbard model on the triangular lattice has been analyzed using rg techniques by tsai and marston@xcite .",
    "these authors were mainly concerned with the half - filled case and could not find any relevant superconducting tendencies for the isotropic triangular lattice . vojta@xcite and dagotto studied superconducting instabilities due to paramagnon - exchange and found that the @xmath9 channel dominates for most densities less than 1 electron / site .",
    "in addition they obtained an odd - frequency @xmath10-wave pairing as dominant channel close to half band filling .",
    "the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) method was also applied to search for superconductivity on the anisotropic triangular lattice@xcite . in this paper",
    "we study two cases :    \\a ) we analyze the parameter case that is , based on lda ( local density approximation ) calculations for naco@xmath0o@xmath11@xcite , currently believed to be relevant for the coo@xmath0 compound where superconductivity was found .",
    "naco@xmath0o@xmath11 has 1.5 electrons per co site in the @xmath12-@xmath13 band close to the fermi energy . for more details",
    "see the papers of singh@xcite and wang et al.@xcite .",
    "the superconducting samples ( na@xmath7coo@xmath8h@xmath0o ) should have 0.15 electrons less per co atom than in the naco@xmath0o@xmath11-layer , i.e. @xmath14/co site .",
    "if we want to describe the lda band structure with a tight binding dispersion , the hopping amplitude @xmath4 should be chosen negative .",

    "the case @xmath16 is obtained by interchanging particles and holes . then the superconducting samples correspond to @xmath17/site .",

    "the chemical potential is chosen corresponding to @xmath30 and the fermi energy is at the van hove density . ]    next we briefly describe the rg formalism that is used to obtain the effective interactions at low temperatures .",
    "we apply the so - called temperature - flow rg scheme introduced recently  @xcite in a @xmath22-patch implementation that covers the full fermi surface .",
    "similar to the approaches in refs .",
    "the @xmath32-flow scheme is derived from an exact rg equation .",
    "however , no low energy cutoff is introduced .",
    "instead of integrating out modes we use the temperature @xmath32 itself as flow parameter and follow the evolution of the fermionic vertex functions as @xmath32 is varied . as was argued recently@xcite the procedure allows an unbiased comparison between af and fm tendencies .",
    "in contrast with that , rg schemes with a flowing ir cutoff artificially suppress particle - hole excitations with small wave vectors , e.g. long wavelength density fluctuations . for a derivation and discussion of the @xmath32-flow rg scheme the reader",
    "is referred to ref .  .",
    "the rg formalism@xcite produces a hierarchy of differential equations for the one - particle irreducible @xmath33-point vertex functions , @xmath34 , as functions of the temperature .",
    "integration of this system of equations gives the temperature - flow .",
    "as initial condition we assume that at a high temperature @xmath35 , the single - particle green s function of the system is simply @xmath36^{-1 } $ ] and the interaction vertex is given by a local repulsion , @xmath37 , or some other short range interaction .",
    "the initial conditions are justified if @xmath35 is sufficiently large .",
    "we truncate the infinite system of equations by dropping all vertex functions @xmath34 with @xmath38 . in the present treatment",
    "we also neglect selfenergy corrections and the frequency dependence of the vertex functions .",
    "this restricts the scheme to one  loop equations for the spin - rotation invariant four - point vertex @xmath39 . starting with weak to moderate interactions",
    ", we follow the @xmath32-flow of @xmath39 as @xmath32 decreases .",
    "the four - point vertex @xmath39 is determined by a coupling function @xmath40 @xmath41 ( see refs .  ) . the initial condition for pure on - site",
    "repulsion is @xmath42 .",
    "the numerical implementation follows the work of zanchi and schulz  @xcite and was already explained in refs .   and .",
    "we define elongated phase space patches around straight lines from the origin to the boundaries of the bz",
    ". next we approximate @xmath43 by a constant for all wave vectors in the same patch .",
    "we calculate the rg flow for the discrete subset of interaction vertices with each fs patch represented by a single wave vector .",
    "most calculations were performed using 48 patches .",
    "we have checked the consistency of the discretization by comparing with up to 96 patches . together with the flow of the interactions we calculate the flow of several static susceptibilities , as described below .",
    "this allows us to analyze which classes of coupling functions and which susceptibilities become important at low @xmath32 . in many cases",
    "we observe a flow to strong coupling , i.e. at sufficiently low temperature some components of the coupling function @xmath44 become larger than the bandwidth .",
    "the approximations mentioned above fail when the couplings become too large .",
    "therefore we stop the flow when the largest coupling exceeds a high value larger than the bandwidth , e.g. @xmath45 .",
    "this defines a _ characteristic temperature _ @xmath46 of the flow to strong coupling . for superconducting and magnetic instabilities",
    "@xmath46 can be interpreted as estimate of the transition temperature if ordering is made possible , e.g. by including coupling in the third lattice direction .    as in previous papers@xcite",
    "we discuss the temperature flow at fixed chemical potential and not at fixed particle density .",
    "since the relevant part of the flow only occurs at low temperatures we do not expect significant qualitative differences between the two possibilities .",
    "first let us consider band fillings where the fermi surface is well inside the first bz with particle densities around half filling and less .",
    "we start the temperature - flow rg at higher initial temperatures @xmath47 with local on - site interactions @xmath48 or @xmath49 and follow the flow down to low scales . in figs .",
    "[ psplot85 ] and [ psplot60 ] we display the behavior of the most repulsive and most attractive coupling constants .",
    "although there is some flow , the coupling functions remain within the oder of the bandwidth @xmath28 , even if we go down to very low scales . above @xmath50 no tendency towards a flow to strong coupling , i.e. a divergence of the coupling constants ,",
    "is observed .    quite generally , for a non - nested fermi surface away from van hove singularities",
    ", superconductivity is the only possible instability at low scales in a weakly coupled system .",
    "kohn and luttinger@xcite gave an argument why superconductivity arises even in the presence of repulsive interactions .",
    "although in our case we do not find a singularity over a wide scale range , it is still interesting to investigate which pair - scattering channel is most attractive .",
    "this channel can in principle become unstable at even lower temperatures . however in real systems these weak instabilities with non-@xmath10-wave pairing symmetries may be wiped out easily by impurity scattering .",
    "for the two different densities in figs .",
    "[ psplot85 ] and [ psplot60 ] we plot the pair scattering @xmath51 at low temperatures together with basis functions of the most attractive pairing channels .",

    "for the half - filled case in fig .",
    "[ psplot85 ] there are two harmonics that grow together more strongly than all other pairing channels .",

    "we expect that a possible superconducting pair amplitude will be proportional to a time - reversal symmetry - breaking superposition @xmath3 of these two basis functions as this maximizes the condensation energy .",
    "lee and feng@xcite applied the gutzwiller approximation scheme and variational monte carlo to the heisenberg model on the triangular lattice . among the paired paramagnetic states they found the @xmath3-wave state to have the lowest energy@xcite .",
    "remarkably this is the pairing symmetry as the one suggested - albeit with extremely low @xmath6 - by the weak coupling rg at small to moderate @xmath60 .",
    "the same type of superconducting pairing was also found near half band filling by various rvb theories@xcite .",
    "we note that in this perturbative treatment of the on - site repulsion no precursors of a mott transition at stronger @xmath37 are visible .",

    "[ psplot60 ] ) .",
    "the dominant pair scattering is in an odd - parity triplet pairing channel with angle dependence @xmath69 , corresponding to the @xmath70 representation of ref . .",
    "comparing the basis function with the actual pair scattering rendered by the rg scheme , we notice that only two of the three repulsive portions of the @xmath69 around the fs are reflected in the pair scattering .",
    "thus even though this representation is the most attractive pairing channel , is does not fully match the effective interactions which mix in other symmetries at this scale .",
    "the second strongest components are @xmath71 and @xmath9 , the first component is clearly visible for @xmath62 close to a maximum of @xmath71 in the right plot in fig .",

    "we repeat that for our parameters and purely local interactions @xmath72 we do not observe flows to strong coupling in the density range around and less than half filling . from the weak coupling perspective",
    "the reason simply is that the fs is relatively round and in the lack of nesting or van hove singularities near the fs the one - loop corrections to the pair scattering do not generate any sufficiently attractive component in the pair scattering .",
    "similar low energy scales for kohn - luttinger superconducting instabilities are found in the weakly repulsive hubbard model on two - dimensional square lattice for a poorly nested fermi surface away from the van hove filling .",
    "we note that with our rg scheme which neglects the frequency dependence of the interaction vertices , it is difficult to investigate odd - frequency pairing .",
    "this unconventional type of pair formation@xcite was suggested by calculations by vojta and dagotto@xcite for the hubbard model on a triangular lattice for larger @xmath60 .",
    "although we can not rule out this possibility for the time being , it is difficult to see how this type of instability should arise for the given rather generic situation unless drastic strong coupling effects are at work .",
    "as has become clear , on - site repulsion alone does not give rise to superconductivity at reasonable energy scales for these band fillings .",
    "therefore we extend our analysis and consider exchange interactions between nearest neighbors , @xmath73 with @xmath74 . in principle",
    "these interactions will be generated by virtual hopping processes for local repulsion @xmath75 .",
    "since we treat all interactions perturbatively , this regime is not accessible with our rg method .",
    "we will therefore just assume that the initial action contains such an exchange term and analyze the consequences .",
    "first let us consider the case @xmath76 and @xmath77 at half band filling .",
    "now the interactions flow to strong coupling at @xmath78 , and an analysis of the coupling functions and susceptibilities shows that the divergence is a very clean cooper instability with again dominant @xmath3 character .",

    "the same picture occurs for general band fillings .",
    "it turns out that at least for @xmath77 , @xmath76 , the @xmath3-wave instability occurs over a wide density range from @xmath95/site up to @xmath96/site ( see lower right plot of fig .",

    "note however that this temperature scale depends exponentially on @xmath2 and the density of states close to the fermi level .",
    "we expect that an additional @xmath1 does not change the leading instability for these densities .",
    "we have checked this for @xmath98 , @xmath99 . of course , our weak coupling analysis is not capable of describing a mott state at half filling for large @xmath60 .",
    "it is interesting to observe the difference between the square lattice and the triangular lattice with nearest neighbor hoppings near half - filling . on the square lattice",
    "the flows to strong coupling and the suggested phases , mainly antiferromagnetic order and @xmath100-wave superconductivity come out of the weak coupling rg very similarly for pure on - site @xmath37 or nearest neighbor exchange @xmath2 . on the triangular lattice",

    "filling we find a ferromagnetic instability .",
    "for chemical potential @xmath104 or @xmath19 band filling , the non - interacting fermi surface forms a hexagon .",
    "its corners coincide with the van hove singularities at the center points of the 6 flat sides of the bz .",
    "therefore we may expect some kind of infrared instability giving rise to a flow to strong coupling of a certain class of coupling constants .",
    "in addition to the diverging density of states , the flat sides of the fermi surface are perfectly nested , and this can cause a rg flow to strong coupling as well . the situation is reminiscent of the simple nearest - neighbor - hopping fermi surface of the 2d square lattice at half filling , where two pairs of nested fs sides meet at the van hove points at @xmath105 .",
    "however on the triangular lattice we expect that the nesting between the three pairs of opposite flat sides is somewhat less effective .",
    "the three nesting wavevectors ( after addition of a reciprocal lattice vector ) point to the three inequivalent centers of the bz sides .",
    "thus they do not correspond to the same wavevector as in the square lattice case .",
    "therefore the low energy phase space weight gets distributed on three different spots in the bz .    in fig .",

    "we have used a @xmath22-patch temperature - flow renormalization group scheme in the one - loop approximation that has been found useful@xcite in the analysis of the weakly coupled hubbard model on the 2d square lattice . starting with a weak to moderate on - site repulsion @xmath136 at high temperatures , we have investigated possible magnetic and superconducting instabilities when",
    "the temperature is lowered . for most fillings and purely local initial interactions , especially for densities less than @xmath1371.4 electrons per lattice site ( for hopping parameter @xmath15 )",
    ", the interactions remain within the order of the bandwidth . down to very low temperatures",
    "@xmath50 no flows to strong coupling are observed . replacing the pure on - site hubbard interaction by an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath2",
    ", the rg flow leads to a superconducting instability towards a time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath3-wave state at sensible scales for a wide density range between @xmath138/site and @xmath139/site .",
    "this state has the same pairing symmetry as the superconducting rvb states found in recent theories for strong on - site repulsion@xcite .",
    "it may also be obtained by ordinary mean - field theories that do not invoke spin - charge separation .    near the van hove density @xmath140/per site",
    ", we observe a flow to strong coupling also for purely local hubbard interactions .",
    "the rapid growth of the interactions at low temperatures is driven by umklapp processes between the van hove regions and nesting between the flat parts of the ( nearly ) hexagon - shaped fermi surface . in the immediate vicinity of the van hove filling",
    "the spin susceptibility near the wavevector @xmath141 and two symmetry - related wavevectors diverges most strongly , signalling magnetic ordering tendencies at these wavevectors .",
    "it may be interesting to investigate whether the systems tends to order ( if we allow coupling between layers ) by choosing one wavevector or by forming a superposition of the three . slightly away from the van hove filling ( outside the range @xmath142/site for @xmath123 ) , the flow in the spin density wave channel is cut off , and the dominant instability occurs in a singlet pairing channel with symmetry @xmath143 , having 12 nodes and 12 extrema when the angle @xmath144 moves around the fermi surface .",
    "this superconducting instability occurs on both sides of the van hove filling and the characteristic temperature @xmath46 falls of rapidly with increasing distance to the van hove density . since the superconducting state has nodes in the vicinity of the van hove points , it may be susceptible to further instabilities at lower temperatures which try to remove the large density of states at zero energy .    turning to the reported superconductivity in the layered cobalt oxides",
    ", we have to keep in mind that it is far from settled that these materials can be described by a simple one - band hubbard model on the triangular lattice .",
    "neither is it clear that they can be treated using weak - coupling techniques .",
    "in fact estimates@xcite of the bandwidth and hubbard @xmath37 for naco@xmath0o@xmath11 seem to show that the material is strongly correlated",
    ". nevertheless it may be helpful to know the weak coupling picture .",
    "band structure calculations for naco@xmath0o@xmath11 by singh @xcite indicate that the main fermi surface is hole - like and centered around the @xmath145 point .",
    "angular resolved photoemission data support this picture@xcite .",
    "translated into the language of a tight - binding model this case corresponds to a negative hopping parameter @xmath16 for electrons .",
    "the superconducting samples may be at @xmath1371.35 electrons / co site , or , with our sign convention @xmath15 that interchanges electrons and holes @xmath146/site .",
    "this case is investigated in section [ boringfs ] . for a purely local hubbard repulsion @xmath1 without additional exchange interactions",
    "no sizable superconducting tendencies can be detected with our weak coupling technique .",
    "antiferromagnetic exchange interactions @xmath131 generate a superconducting instability towards a @xmath3-wave state over a wide density range . in this respect , weak coupling rg and rvb theories for the strongly correlated @xmath4-@xmath2 model@xcite give similar predictions at least as far as the symmetry of the pairing is concerned .",
    "thus the time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath147 state may be the primary candidate for experimental checks .",
    "this state has a fully gapped single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "the phase structure of the order parameter may give rise to observable effects@xcite such as subgap andreev bound states at surfaces similar to those in @xmath102-wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work was to investigate possible superconducting states on the triangular lattice at weak to moderate interactions .",
    "further work is needed in order to clarify the relevance of the weak coupling physics to real materials like the cobalt oxides .",
