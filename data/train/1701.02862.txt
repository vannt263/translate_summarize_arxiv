    "if we simply apply multiplication on the expressions in the formulas ( 2.11 ) , we get the two elements @xmath144 where @xmath136 .",

    "consider e.g. the two expressions : @xmath145 where @xmath136 .",
    "the first expression above is obtained by applying the canonical map @xmath51 to the first of the two expressions in ( 2.11 ) .",
    "so this gives an element in @xmath40 and we know that it is @xmath146 as we can see from the formula ( 2.6 ) above .",
    "similarly , the second expression above is obtained by applying the canonical map @xmath52 to the second of the two expressions in ( 2.11 ) . we know that this is @xmath147 as we see from the formula ( 2.7 ) above .",
    "remark that @xmath148 and @xmath147 belong to @xmath40 because by assumption @xmath149 , but that on the other hand , it is not obvious ( as we see from the above arguments ) that the expressions that we obtain for these elements belong to @xmath40 .",
    "\\iv ) finally , as a consequence of the above statements , also the four expressions @xmath150 are well - defined in @xmath151 for all @xmath136 .",

    "once again , in all these cases , the sweedler notation is just used as a more transparent way to denote expressions .",
    "we refer to the coverings just to indicate how the formulas with the sweedler notation can be rewritten without the use of it .",
