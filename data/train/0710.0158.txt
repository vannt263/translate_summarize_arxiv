    "the last two years have witnessed tremendous progress in simulations of black hole binaries , starting with the first stable simulation of orbiting and merging black holes  @xcite , development of the moving puncture method  @xcite and rapid progress by other groups  @xcite . since then , an enormous amount of work has been done on the late inspiral and merger of black hole binaries , among them studies of the universality of the merger waveforms @xcite , investigations into black hole kicks @xcite and spin dynamics  @xcite , comparisons to post - newtonian models @xcite , and applications to gravitational wave data analysis  @xcite .    compared to the intense activity focusing on simulations close to merger , there have been relatively few simulations covering the inspiral phase . to date , only three simulations  @xcite cover more than five orbits .",
    "long inspiral simulations are challenging for a variety of reasons : first , the orbital period increases rapidly with separation , so that simulations must cover a significantly longer evolution time .",
    "in addition , the gravitational waveform must be extracted at larger radius ( and the simulation must therefore cover a larger spatial volume ) because the gravitational wavelength is longer .",
    "furthermore , gravitational wave data analysis requires small _ absolute _ accumulated phase uncertainties in the waveform , so the relative phase uncertainty of the simulation must be smaller .    gravitational wave detectors provide a major driving force for numerical relativity ( nr ) . the first generation interferometric gravitational wave detectors , such as ligo  @xcite , geo600  @xcite and virgo  @xcite , are now operating at or near their design sensitivities . furthermore , the advanced generation of detectors are entering their construction phases .",
    "this new generation of interferometers will improve detector sensitivity by a factor of @xmath4 and hence increase expected event rates by a factor of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising sources for these detectors is the inspiral and merger of binary black holes ( bbhs ) with masses @xmath6@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "these systems are expected to have circularized long before their gravitational waves enter the sensitive frequency band of ground - based detectors  @xcite .    a detailed and accurate understanding of the gravitational waves radiated as the black holes spiral towards each other will be crucial not only to the initial detection of such sources , but also to maximize the information that can be obtained from signals once they are observed .",
    "when the black holes are far apart , the gravitational waveform can be accurately computed using a post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion .",
    "as the holes approach each other and their velocities increase , the post - newtonian expansion is expected to diverge from the true waveform .",
    "it is important to quantify any differences between theoretical waveforms and the true signals , as discrepancies will cause a reduction of search sensitivity .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to address the problem of the breakdown of the post - newtonian approximation  @xcite , but ultimately , the accuracy of the post - newtonian waveforms used in binary black hole gravitational wave searches can only be established through comparisons with full numerical simulations .    unfortunately , comparing post - newtonian approximations to numerical simulations is not straightforward , the most obvious problem being the difficulty of producing long and sufficiently accurate numerical simulations as explained above .",
    "in addition , post - newtonian waveforms typically assume circular orbits , and most astrophysical binaries are expected to be on circular orbits late in their inspiral , so the orbital eccentricity within the numerical simulation must be sufficiently small .",
    "another factor that complicates comparisons is the variety of post - newtonian approximants available , from several straightforward taylor expansions to more sophisticated pad resummation techniques and the effective one - body approach ( see e.g.  @xcite , as well as section  [ sec : taylor - approximants ] below ) .",
    "while all post - newtonian approximants of the same order should agree sufficiently early in the inspiral ( when neglected higher - order terms are small ) , they begin to disagree with each other during the late inspiral when the post - newtonian approximation starts to break down  exactly the regime in which nr waveforms are becoming available .    finally , agreement ( or disagreement ) between nr and pn waveforms will also depend very sensitively on the precise protocol used to compare the waveforms .",
    "are pn and nr waveforms matched early or late in the inspiral ?",
    "is the matching done at a particular time , or is a least - squares fit performed over part ( or all ) of the waveform ?",
    "does one compare frequencies @xmath8 or phases @xmath9 ?",
    "are comparisons presented as functions of time or of frequency ? up to which cutoff frequency does one compare pn with nr ?    despite these difficulties ,",
    "several comparisons between nr and pn have been done for the last few orbits of an equal - mass , non - spinning black hole binary .",
    "the first such study was done by buonanno _",
    "et al _  @xcite based on simulations performed by pretorius  @xcite lasting somewhat more than 4 orbits ( @xmath10 gravitational wave cycles ) .",
    "this comparison performs a least - squares fit over the full waveform , finds agreement between the numerical evolution and a particular post - newtonian approximant ( in our language taylort3 3.0/0.0 for more details . ] ) and notes that another approximant ( taylort4 3.5/0.0 ) will give similarly good agreement .",
    "however , as the authors note , this study is severely limited by numerical resolution , sizable initial eccentricity ( @xmath11 ) , close initial separation of the black holes , and coordinate artifacts ; for these reasons , the authors do not quantify the level of agreement .    more recently , baker et al .  @xcite performed simulations covering the last @xmath12 cycles before merger .",
    "these simulations have an orbital eccentricity @xmath13  @xcite , forcing the authors to use a fitted smooth ( `` de - eccentrized '' ) gravitational wave phase to obtain a monotonically increasing gravitational wave frequency . comparing to taylort4 3.5/2.5",
    ", they find agreement between numerical and post - newtonian gravitational wave phase to within their numerical errors , which are about 2 radians .",
    "the authors also indicate that other post - newtonian approximants do not match their simulation as well as taylort4 , but unfortunately , they do not mention whether any disagreement is significant ( i.e. , exceeding their numerical errors ) .",
    "al _  @xcite performed a more comprehensive analysis of the numerical waveforms computed by pretorius  @xcite and the goddard group  @xcite , confirming that taylort4 3.5/0.0 matches the numerical results best .",
    "the most accurate inspiral simulation to date was performed by the jena group and presented in husa et al .",
    "@xcite and hannam et al .",
    "this simulation covers 18 cycles before merger and has an orbital eccentricity of @xmath14  @xcite . discarding the first two cycles which are contaminated by numerical noise , and terminating the comparison at a gravitational - wave frequency @xmath15 ( see eq .",

    "this paper presents a new inspiral simulation of a non - spinning equal mass black hole binary .",
    "this new simulation more than doubles the evolution time of the simulations in refs .",

    "the orbital eccentricity of our simulations is @xmath17 ; this low eccentricity is achieved using refinements of techniques described in  @xcite .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of various effects which might influence our comparisons to post - newtonian waveforms for non - spinning black hole binaries on circular orbits .",
    "these effects result in an uncertainty of @xmath18 radians out of the accumulated @xmath19 radians .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the largest uncertainty arises from the residual orbital eccentricity , despite its tiny value .",
    "the second largest effect arises due to a potential residual spin on the black holes , which we bound by @xmath20 .",
    "we compare the numerical waveforms with four different time - domain post - newtonian taylor - approximants  @xcite and we match pn and nr waveforms at a specific time during the inspiral .",
    "we explore the effects of varying this matching time .",
    "when matching @xmath21 cycles after the start of our evolution , all post - newtonian approximants of 3.0pn and 3.5pn order in orbital phase agree with our simulation to within @xmath22 radians over the first 15 cycles .",
    "this agreement is better than the combined uncertainties of the comparison , thus validating our simulations in a regime where the 3.5pn truncation error of post - newtonian theory is comparable to the accuracy of our simulations .",
    "lower order post - newtonian approximants ( 2.0pn and 2.5pn order ) , however , accumulate a significant phase difference of @xmath23 radians over this region .    extending the comparison toward merger ( as well as when matching closer to merger ) , we find , not surprisingly , that the agreement between pn and nr at late times depends strongly on exactly what post - newtonian approximant we use  @xcite .",
    "typical accumulated phase differences are on the order of radians at frequency @xmath15 .",
    "one particular post - newtonian approximant , taylort4 at 3.5pn order in phase , agrees with our nr waveforms far better than the other approximants , the agreement being within the phase uncertainty of the comparison ( 0.05 radians ) until after the gravitational wave frequency passes @xmath15 ( about 3.5 cycles before merger ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this agreement is fundamental or accidental , and whether it applies to more complicated situations ( e.g. unequal masses , nontrivial spins ) .",
    "we also compare the post - newtonian gravitational wave amplitude to the numerical amplitude , where we estimate the uncertainty of this comparison to be about @xmath24 .",
    "restricted waveforms ( i.e. , 0pn order in the amplitude expansion ) are found to disagree with the numerical amplitudes by 67% .",
    "an amplitude expansion of order 2pn shows significantly better agreement than the expansion at order 2.5pn .",
    "a newly derived 3pn amplitude  @xcite is found to give much better agreement than the 2.0pn amplitude .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : nrgeneration ] discusses our numerical techniques .",
    "in particular , we describe how we construct binary black hole initial data , evolve these data for 15 orbits , extract gravitational wave information from the evolution , and produce a gravitational waveform as seen by an observer at infinity .",

    "[ sec : summaryerrors ] .",
    "the comparisons between nr and pn are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "this section is split into two parts : first , we compare each pn approximant separately with the numerical simulation .",
    "subsequently , we show some additional figures which facilitate cross - comparisons between the different pn approximants .",
    "finally , we present some concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the impatient reader primarily interested in nr - pn comparisons may wish to proceed directly to table  [ tab : errors ] summarizing the uncertainties of our comparisons , and then continue to sec .  [",

    "[ fig : nr - taylort1 ] .",
    "in order to do a quantitative comparison between numerical and post - newtonian waveforms , it is important to have a code capable of starting the black holes far enough apart to be in a regime where we strongly believe the post - newtonian approximation is valid , track the orbital phase extremely accurately , and do so efficiently so the simulation can be completed in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "furthermore , the gravitational waves from such a simulation must be extracted in such a manner that preserves the accuracy of the simulation and predicts the waveform as seen by a distant observer , so a comparison with the post - newtonian waveform can be made . in this section",
    "we describe the techniques we use to do this , as well as the results of a simulation starting more than 15 orbits prior to merger .",
    "when discussing numerical solutions of einstein s equations , we write all dimensioned quantities in terms of some mass scale @xmath25 , which we choose to be the sum of the irreducible masses of the two black holes in the initial data : @xmath26 the irreducible mass of a single hole is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the surface area of the event horizon ; in practice we take @xmath28 to be the surface area of the apparent horizon . more generally , it is more appropriate to use the christodoulou mass of each black hole , @xmath29 instead of the irreducible mass . here",

    "figure  [ fig : ahmass ] demonstrates that the irreducible mass is conserved to a fractional accuracy of about @xmath48 .",

    "we thus estimate that for taylort1 , to achieve 1-radian phase coherence with the early inspiral may require matching more than 10 cycles before merger",

    "[ fig : pnvsnr_byorder ] suggests that the remarkable agreement between our numerical results and the 3.5pn taylort4 approximant may be simply due to luck ; clearly , more pn - nr comparisons are needed , with different mass ratios and spins , to see if this is the case .",
    "we have described numerical simulations of an equal mass , non - spinning binary black hole spacetime covering 15 orbits of inspiral just prior to the merger of the two black holes .",
    "using a multi - domain pseudospectral method we are able to extract the gravitational wave content measured by a distant observer with a phase accuracy of better than 0.02 radians over the roughly 30 cycles of gravitational radiation observed . we demonstrate that in order to achieve this accuracy it is necessary to accurately extrapolate the waveform from data obtained at extraction surfaces sufficiently far from the center of mass of the system .",
    "when comparing to zero - spin , zero - eccentricity pn formulae , our phase uncertainty increases to 0.05 radians because the numerical simulation has a small but nonzero orbital eccentricity and small but nonzero spins on the holes .    judging from the case",
    "in which we match at @xmath112 , our numerical simulations are consistent ( within our estimated phase uncertainty ) with all pn approximants ( at the highest pn order ) from the beginning of our inspiral until about 15 gravitational wave cycles prior to the merger of the binary .",
    "this agreement provides an important validation of our numerical simulation .",
    "it also establishes a regime in which the 3.5-th order post - newtonian waveforms are accurate to this level , at least for an equal mass , non - spinning black hole binary .",
    "after this point , the various pn approximants begin to diverge , suggesting that the approximation is beginning to break down .",
    "since there are many different pn approximants ( including pad  @xcite and effective - one - body  @xcite which were not discussed in this paper ) it may be possible to find a clever way to push the pn expansion beyond its breaking point .    indeed , we find that one approximant , taylort4 at 3.5pn in phase , works astonishingly well , agreeing with our numerical waveforms for almost the entire 30-cycle length of our runs .",
    "given the wide scatter plot of predictions by various pn approximants , it is likely that taylort4 3.5/3.0 simply got lucky for the equal mass non - spinning black hole binary .",
    "in fact , the assumption of adiabaticity ( _ i.e. , _ circular orbits ) is known to lead to much larger phase differences relative to a non - adiabatic inspiral ( see fig .",
    "4 of @xcite and  @xcite ) than the phase differences between nr and taylort4 we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr - taylort4 ] .",
    "thus it seems that the uncontrolled higher order terms of taylort4 3.5/3.0 balance the error introduced by the adiabaticity assumption to a remarkable degree .",
    "it remains to be determined whether similar cancellations occur when the black hole masses are unequal or when the holes have nonzero spin .",
    "regardless of the robustness of taylort4 , it seems evident that numerical simulations are needed in order to know which , if any , pn approximant yields the correct waveform after the various approximants begin to diverge . for",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason why taylort4 should be a better choice than taylort1 as they differ only in whether the ratio of gravitational wave flux to the derivative of the orbital energy with respect to frequency is left as a ratio of post - newtonian expansions or re - expanded as a single post - newtonian expansion .",
    "the surprising accuracy of taylort4 3.5/3.0 in the gravitational frequency range from @xmath172 through @xmath173 , for the equal mass , non - spinning inspiral of two black holes , in principle could form a basis for evaluating the errors of numerical simulations . instead of worrying about errors due to different formulations , initial data , boundary conditions , extraction methods , etc .",
    ", perhaps a long inspiral simulation could be compared with taylort4 3.5/3.0 in order to get a direct estimate of the phase error . similarly ,",
    "because of its good agreement , taylort4 3.5/3.0 could also be used to address questions that require much longer waveforms than currently available , for instance the question of when lower order post - newtonian waveforms become unreliable .",
    "we find that the 3pn contributions to the amplitude of the @xmath164 modes improve their accuracy with respect to the numerical waveforms .",
    "this suggests that for accurate parameter estimation , it may be desirable to compute the full 3pn amplitude for the polarization waveforms . despite the formidable nature of the calculation required",
    ", it would also be interesting to see how the inclusion of 4pn order corrections to the phasing would affect our comparisons .",
    "much work still needs to be done to improve the comparison between nr and pn .",
    "our primary goal is to push our simulations through merger and ringdown so that we may compare various resummed pn approximants and the effective - one - body approximants during the last cycle of inspiral and merger , as well as test taylort4 3.5/3.0 closer to merger .",
    "we also intend to do long inspirals with arbitrary masses and spins in order to test the robustness of pn over a range of these parameters .",
    "furthermore we wish to improve our initial data .",
    "there is a large amount of junk radiation present in the initial data that limits how early we can match pn and nr waveforms .",
    "reduction of this junk radiation  @xcite would improve the accuracy of our simulations as well .",
    "finally , we have done just a simple comparison between nr and pn , without including any treatment of effects that are important for real gravitational wave detectors such as limited bandwidth and detector noise . in order to more directly address the suitability of pn formulae for analyzing data from gravitational wave detectors",
    ", it will be necessary to fold in the properties of the detector , to consider specific values for the total mass of the binary , and to fit for the mass from the waveforms rather than assuming that the pn and nr waveforms correspond to the same mass .",
