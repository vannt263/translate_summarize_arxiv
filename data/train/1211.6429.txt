    "<S> all massive galaxies likely have supermassive black holes at their centers , and the masses of the black holes are known to correlate with properties of the host galaxy bulge component@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several explanations have been proposed for the existence of these locally - established empirical relationships ; they include the non - causal , statistical process of galaxy - galaxy merging@xcite , direct feedback between the black hole and its host galaxy@xcite , or galaxy - galaxy merging and the subsequent violent relaxation and dissipation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical scaling relations are thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models of galaxy evolution@xcite , and they further form the basis for all black hole mass measurements at large distances . in particular , observations have shown that the mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of the galaxy@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the small galaxy ngc4486b currently has the largest published fraction of its mass in a black hole at 11 per cent @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we report observations of the stellar kinematics of ngc 1277 , which is a compact , disky galaxy with a mass of @xmath0 . from the data , </S>",
    "<S> we determine that the mass of the central black hole is @xmath1 , or 59% its bulge mass . </S>",
    "<S> five other compact galaxies have properties similar to ngc 1277 and therefore may also contain over - sized black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is not yet known if these galaxies represent a tail of a distribution , or if disk - dominated galaxies fail to follow the normal black hole mass scaling relations@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    direct black hole mass measurements often rely on obtaining spatially resolved stellar or gas kinematics within the region over which the black hole dominates the gravitational potential , the so - called sphere - of - influence . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained long - slit spectroscopy of 700 nearby galaxies with the marcario low resolution spectrograph@xcite on the hobby - eberly telescope to find suitable targets for direct black hole mass measurements ( see si ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in table  [ tab : properties ] , six of these galaxies have very peculiar properties ; they have velocity dispersion @xmath2  and half - light radii @xmath3kpc . </S>",
    "<S> it is unusual for such small galaxies to have such large dispersions , signifying an unusually high central mass concentration : a simple virial mass estimate indicates that the central 200 parsec contains more than 10 billion solar masses which is one hundred times more than typical for galaxies of the same size .    </S>",
    "<S> black hole masses can be measured directly by fitting self - consistent schwarzschild models@xcite to spatially resolved spectroscopy and high resolution imaging . incidentally , </S>",
    "<S> archival hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) imaging is available for one of these six dense galaxies , ngc1277 . based on the _ hst _ imaging ( figure  [ fig : ngc1277pretty ] ) and the stellar kinematics ( figure  [ fig : ngc1277slit ] ) we constructed 600000 orbit - based models using iterative refinement to search parameter space@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit model is then found by marginalizing over all parameters : the stellar mass - to - light ratio , the black - hole mass , and the dark halo@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the confidence intervals are determined with the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a black - hole mass of 17@xmath5  and total stellar mass of @xmath6 , with @xmath7 confidence intervals based on @xmath8 after marginalizing over the dark halo parameters ( see si . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole in ngc1277 is one of the most massive black holes to be dynamically confirmed , and moreover has a mass fraction of 14 per cent of the total stellar mass in this galaxy .        </S>",
    "<S> no galaxy has previously been seen with such a large ratio of black - hole mass to stellar mass . due to the strong disk - like rotation ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ngc1277slit ] ) and the lack of an unambiguous bulge in ngc1277 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ngc1277pretty ] ) , it is difficult to place it on the relation between black - hole mass and bulge luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the central pseudo - bulge contains 24% of the light ( see figure  [ fig : ngc1277pretty ] ) and black hole - to - bulge mass fraction is 59 per cent . as shown in fig  [ fig : scaleml ] , ngc1277 is a significant outlier from the black - hole - bulge relation by two orders of magnitude . at a fixed bulge luminosity of @xmath9@xmath10 l@xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> dynamical black - hole - mass measurements now range over four orders of magnitude , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , showing that ( pseudo-)bulge luminosity is not a good predictor for black - hole mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we now place ngc1277 on the relation between black - hole mass and velocity dispersion ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average velocity dispersion inside the half - light radius ( 2.8 ) and outside the sphere - of - influence ( 1.6 ) for ngc1277 is @xmath14 , based on a reconstruction of the best - fit orbit - based model . </S>",
    "<S> for this @xmath15 , the most recent inferred relation@xcite predicts a black - hole mass of @xmath16 , so the measured value is almost one magnitude higher , or a @xmath17 outlier relative to the intrinsic scatter in the  relation@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties , except for the ngc1277 bulge luminosity , where we use its total luminosity as a conservative upper limit . ]    besides ngc1277 , ngc4486b@xcite and henize2 - 10@xcite are known to lie significantly above the relations . at the same time , at least 3 galaxies are known to lie significantly below the relations , too@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not yet know if these over - massive and under - massive black holes are just the tail of a relatively narrow distribution of joint black - hole  </S>",
    "<S> galaxy properties , or if they demonstrate non - universality . only through more black hole measurements , including those in the other five compact galaxies with high velocity dispersions , we will be able to establish the cause of the black - hole  </S>",
    "<S> galaxy connection .    a stellar population analysis of ngc1277@xcite indicates there are only old ( @xmath18gyr ) stars present and </S>",
    "<S> there has not been any recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the black hole must thus have been in place since that time , as a scenario where black hole accretion happens without significant star formation or the formation of a ( classical ) bulge is highly unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is no strong evidence that ngc1277 has been tidally stripped , as its isophotes are extremely regular and disky and appears to have a normal dark matter halo inferred from the dynamical model , and at large radii the rotation curve is flat out to five times the half - light radius .    </S>",
    "<S> whereas the six compact galaxies presented in table  [ tab : properties ] are unusual and rare in the present - day universe , they are , interestingly enough , quantitatively similar to the typical red , passive , galaxies at much earlier times ( at redshifts @xmath19 ) : those are also found , on average , to be smaller than similarly massive galaxies in the present - day universe@xcite , possibly possess high velocity dispersions@xcite , and generally have a disk - like structure@xcite . perhaps the compact systems we found are local analogues of these high - redshift galaxies .     </S>",
    "<S> error bars , were measured@xcite at 31 locations along the major axis of ngc1277 ( see si . ) . </S>",
    "<S> panels a , b , c and d , from top to bottom , show the mean velocity , velocity dispersion , and higher - order gauss - hermite velocity moments@xcite @xmath20 and @xmath21 , representing skewness and kurtosis , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics show a remarkably flat rotation curve and a dispersion profile that strongly peaks toward the center . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit schwarszchild model ( black line ) has a @xmath22  black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between black - hole mass and host luminosity predicts a @xmath23  black hole , but the corresponding model ( red dot - dashed line ) does not fit the data at all . </S>",
    "<S> the telescope resolution ( seeing 1.6  fwhm ) is indicated in panel b and is sufficient to resolve the sphere - of - influence of the black hole . </S>",
