    "<S> we study the magnetic properties of two types of one dimensional @xmath0 spin @xmath1 chains . </S>",
    "<S> the first type has only nearest neighbor interactions which can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic and the second type which has both nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor interactions , but only antiferromagnetic in character . </S>",
    "<S> we study these systems in the presence of low transverse magnetic fields both analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of results show a close relation between the two systems , which is in agreement with results previously found in heisenberg chains by means of a numerical real space renormalization group procedure . </S>"
