    "two - parameter scaling functions can be written for various observables and , for a finite system , these involve two dimensionless variables : the ratios @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "however we consider only edge magnetic fields .",
    "we monitor the induced dimerization and spin moments at the center of the chain as the chain length @xmath6 is enlarged via the dmrg algorithm .",

    "@xmath36 the induced dimerization scales as a power - law with possible multiplicative logarithmic corrections : @xmath37 a similar expression holds for the induced spin moment at the center of the chain , @xmath38 , with the replacement of the exponents @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the name `` density - matrix renormalization - group '' is something of a misnomer as the method is most accurate away from critical points , when there is an energy gap for excitations .",
    "it is helpful to think of the dmrg algorithm as a systematic variational approximation for the calculation of the ground state and/or low - lying excitations , principally in one dimension .",
    "the hilbert space of a quantum chain generally grows exponentially with the chain length , and eventually must exceed available computer memory .",
    "the dmrg algorithm is an efficient way to truncate the hilbert space ; as the size of the space retained can be varied ( up to machine limits ) it is possible to ascertain the size of errors introduced by the truncation .    for simplicity",
    ", we use the so - called `` infinite - size '' dmrg algorithm@xcite . as the algorithm has been described in some detail by white ,",
    "we just sketch the essentials of the method .",

    "for quantum spin chains @xmath42 , thus @xmath43 for the spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "the chain is then cut through the middle into two pieces , one half of which is interpreted as the `` system '' and the other half as the `` environment , '' the two parts combined being thought of as the entire `` universe '' of the problem , see fig .",
    "[ dmrg1 ] . at this point the reduced density matrix for the system , of size @xmath44 is constructed by performing a partial trace over the environment half of the chain .",
    "it is defined by : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the real - valued matrix elements of the eigenstate of interest ( the `` target '' which is often the ground state ) projected onto a basis of states labeled by unprimed roman index @xmath47 which covers the system half of the chain and primed index @xmath48 which covers the environment half of the chain .",
    "the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix are real , positive , and sum up to one ; these are interpreted as probabilities .",
    "we keep only the @xmath49 most probable eigenstates corresponding to the largest eigenvalues , and discard the remaining @xmath50 eigenstates .",
    "the retained states form a new basis for the problem .",
    "next , two new sites are added to the middle of the chain and the pieces are connected , yielding a chain of size @xmath51 .",
    "the process is then repeated by finding the targeted state of this chain , constructing the new reduced density matrix and again projecting onto the @xmath49 most probable states .",
    "as the chain length grows in steps of two , the total hilbert space dimension grows by a multiplicative factor of @xmath52 .",
    "none of the hilbert space is thrown away until the chain grows large enough that its hilbert space exceeds the space that is held in reserve , in other words until @xmath53 .",
    "the truncation process damages the outer regions of the chain the most , and the central region is treated most accurately .",
    "= 4.5 in    one advantage of the method presented in this paper is that critical exponents are extracted from ground - state correlations only .",
    "excited states are not needed for these exponents and there is no need to calculate the excitation gap .",
    "furthermore , the finite size analysis described in the previous subsection takes advantage of the fact that the dmrg algorithm works best with open chains and treats the central region of the chain most accurately .",
    "the use of the more complicated finite - size algorithm might yield even more accurate results .",
    "however , we show below that we can calculate critical exponents to an accuracy of a few percent or better with the infinite - size algorithm .",
    "as a simple first illustration of our finite - size scaling method we study the ordinary tight binding model of spinless fermions hopping from site - to - site along a chain at half - filling . obviously , the dmrg algorithm is not needed in this case as we can solve the quadratic problem exactly via a fourier transform .",
