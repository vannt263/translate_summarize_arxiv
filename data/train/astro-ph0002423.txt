    "the homogeneity of photometric characteristics of stars in a cluster and their dynamics indicate that the cluster stars should have formed from one and the same primordial cloud within a relatively short time scale . therefore , almost all member stars in a cluster should have roughly same age and chemical composition . furthermore",
    ", open clusters can be used to understand both the formation and kinematics of the galactic disk due to their wide age and mass distributions . for these reasons ,",
    "open clusters constitute one of the most important research fields in observational and theoretical astronomy .",
    "ages , distances , masses , luminosity functions and mass functions of open clusters are their basic researches .",
    "the region of the open cluster ngc1750 has been paid more and more attention mainly because it is a complex area including two open clusters ( ngc1750 and ngc1758 ) and the taurus dark clouds , which located in the anticenter direction of the galaxy .",
    "cuffey(1937 ) was the first one to study this area systematically , obtaining extensive photographic photometry of stars in blue and red photometric bands to a limiting magnitude about @xmath4mag .",
    "however he did not clearly point out the existence of two open clusters in this region .",
    "he considered the whole area as ngc1746 with distance about 590pc and @xmath50.30mag .",

    "the density measurements of the whole areas of individual plates were done on the photometric data systems ( pds ) model 1010 automatic measuring machine at the dominion astrophysical observatory ( dao ) of canada .",
    "the reductions of @xmath9,@xmath10 magnitudes were carried out according to the method presented by stetson ( 1979 ) . because the range of candidate stars on each plate covers more than 7 magnitudes , the images of bright stars are generally saturated when the densities of faint stars can be measured .",
    "the fits of gaussian point - spread - functions ( psf ) to the unsaturated stars are good .",
    "however , the difference between the real psf and gaussian distribution of saturated stars are obvious , especially for stars in the cluster center region .",
    "fortunately , stetson ( 1979 ) has already concerned these two kinds of situations .",
    "the photographic magnitude index @xmath15 can be defined by the following equation    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is a measure of the total density of each star on a plate .",
    "the magnitude indices for each band are averaged together among all plates , and the individual plates are transformed to this average plate by the least - squares method .",
    "at the same time , these fittings permit the standard error of a magnitude index on a typical plate to be estimated from the transformation residuals .",
    "the johnson - system _ bv _ photometric magnitudes are obtained by means of 141 secondary standard stars in this region with _ bv _ ccd photometry presented by gjtr before their paper was published . the magnitudes of these stars are all brighter than magnitude 14 in both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands . in addition , we choose about 40 standard stars fainter than magnitude 14 from table 5 of gjtr , which have a homologous distribution on our plates .",
    "our photographic magnitude transformation equations are cubic polynomials in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with a linear color term in each band .",
    "generally , the candidate stars of the photometric standards should obey two principles ( see shu et al .",
    "1998 for details ) : ( 1 ) the photometric standards should be distributed as homogeneously as possible along the magnitude interval covered on the plates ; ( 2 ) they should be well isolated .",
    "the number of the standard stars used in the transformation of each plate and the residual rms are listed in column 6 and 7 of table  1 respectively .",
    "the total number of stars we measured in the present study is 789 .",
    "their @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes extend down to about 16.5@xmath18mag with accuracies estimated by both averaging the individual measurements of each star and considering the weighted internal error of the profile fitting .",
    "because the centers of the available photographic plates are not exactly the same , some stars with large fitting errors must be discarded .",
    "at the same time , it is worthy noting that _ bv _ magnitudes of some stars are taken from only one or two plates . as a result",
    ", all 789 stars have @xmath10 magnitudes , with 540 stars among them measured on three or four plates , and only 653 stars have @xmath9 magnitudes , among which 481 were measured on three or four plates .",
    "the final accuracy for the stars which are measurable on at least three plates is given as a function of apparent visual magnitude in table  2 and illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "one can see that average accuracies are almost the same for different magnitudes except for the faint end , which show larger scatters .",

    "number of stars observed ( n ) and + averaged accuracy @xmath19 at different magnitude + intervals + [ 0.05 mm ] [ tabwater2 ] @xmath20 *    the accuracies of the derived magnitudes depend on the film of the plates and its homogeneity , the magnitude range of the standard stars used in the reductions , and the uncertainty resulting from transforming to the standard system . in general , it is difficult to obtain an accuracy of photographic photometry better than 0.1@xmath18mag . in the present study",

    "it can be found clearly that this mean difference is small than the internal accuracy of stars available on at least three plates .",

    "it is because that our result is reduced from that of gjtr which has a very good accuracy .",
    "furthermore , this also implies that the reduced method we adopted is reasonable .",
    "in fact , the mean difference of the 540 and 481 stars available on at least three plates in @xmath9 and @xmath10 band respectively are larger than above we estimated in table 2 .",
    "it is consistent with the normal principle that the external accuracy must be worse than the internal accuracy .",

    "although the proper motion in the present work is slightly larger than that of gjtr in both directions , which is due to the different reference frames adopted , it can be concluded that the two sets of results are consistent with each other , and there will be no significant difference in the results of membership determination because of the linear transformation .",
    "in order to investigate the basic astrophysical parameters of these two clusters , we must construct samples of members with positions , kinematics , membership probabilities and photometries available for individual stars . in the present work , there are 504 stars with both @xmath9 , @xmath10 photometry and proper motion data , for which positions , proper motions and membership probabilities can be obtained from our previous work ( tzss ) . @xmath9 and",

    "the sums of the membership probabilities for these 504 stars belong to ngc1750 and ngc1758 are 314 and 28 respectively .",
    "meanwhile , the numbers of stars with membership probabilities higher than 0.7 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 are 311 and 23 .",
    "we reasonably choose these 311 and 23 stars as our selected samples to analyze the cm diagram of the two clusters , in order to obtain the distances , ages and the kinematics of the individual clusters .",
    "on the other hand , all 504 stars are used to study the luminosity functions and mass functions ( see below ) .",
    "the cm diagram offers a powerful diagnostic of the evolutionary state of an open cluster . because the locations of open clusters tend to be close to the plane of the galaxy , their cm diagrams are liable to be heavily contaminated by unrelated field stars , and some caution",
    "must be taken into account to minimize this contamination by selecting stars on the basis of their kinematics , or by selecting only those stars with colors that are consistent with objects that have been reddened by the dust between us and the cluster .",
    "figure 4 shows the observed cm diagrams of ngc1750 and ngc1758 , respectively , based on the sample described above .",
    "the dots denote stars with @xmath9 and @xmath10 taken from the present work and the open circles denote the stars with photometries from gjtr .",
    "it can be seen that both observational color - magnitude diagrams show fairly clear main sequences . toward the bottom of the diagram ,",
    "the main sequence becomes boarder for ngc1750 , with a width too large to be attributed to observational errors , which reflects the containination of field stars    in general , we do not know the cluster distances , so we can not plot the cmds on an absolute - magnitude scale .",
    "however , most cluster sizes are sufficiently small relative to their distance , so we can assume as usual that all stars belonging to a cluster lie at the same distance . to reduce contamination of field stars as much as possible , we trace the cm diagrams obtained by selecting stars with membership probabilities larger than 0.90 , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . it can be found that fig.5 is much tighter than fig.4 .",
    "a careful discussion of the color excess due to dust absorption in front of these two clusters has been presented by gjrt .",
    "they found that the interstellar medium is relatively transparent toward the two clusters and the johnson color excess for both of them is @xmath30mag , which corresponds to an extinction value of @xmath31 mag .",
    "based on these observational properties and the empirical zams ( mermilliod 1981 ; schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , we can derive the distance modular of 8.60mag for ngc1750 and 9.50mag for ngc1758 , which correspond to the distances of ( @xmath0pc ) for ngc1750 and ( @xmath1pc ) for ngc1758 with core radii of 2.6@xmath18pc and 0.5@xmath18pc respectively(tzss ) .",
    "the age distribution of open clusters plays an important role in many astrophysical researches , which can be used to estimate the lower limit for the age of the galactic disk ( grenon , 1989 ) , investigate the formation and evolution , especially the star formation history of our disk , as well as its dynamics ( janes & phelps , 1994 ; shu et al 1996 ) .",
    "there are various methods to estimate ages of open clusters , which can lead to a significant scatter of the results for individual cluster .",
    "this is because of the differences among isochrone fitting , conversion from theoretical to observed stellar parameters , and so on .",
    "the most popular method adopted up to today is the fitting of theoretical isochrones to the observed cm diagram .",
    "the age determination of ngc1750 and ngc1758 in the present study is relatively difficult because of the relatively small number of photographic plates and some bright stars over - saturated , i.e. , it is difficult to determine the turn - off points of these two clusters .",
    "another reason is the relatively poor precision of the photographic photometries . here , the same as gjtr did",
    ", we assume that the brightest stars on the main sequences of fig .",
    "5 denote the turn - off points of these two clusters , which are to be compared to the isochrones . after comparing the observed color - magnitude diagrams with those of theoretical results given by schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for solar metallicity , we get the estimated ages of @xmath2yr for ngc1750 and @xmath3yr for ngc1758 , which are shown in fig .  5    the lifetimes of main sequence stars as a function of their absolute visual magnitudes @xmath32 are also presented by meynet et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "the brightest star , for ngc1750 , which is assumed to be on the ms , is at @xmath33 mag , which corresponds to an age of about @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the fact that the brightest star on the ms for ngc1758 has @xmath35mag leads to its age of @xmath36yr . according to the relation among stellar mass ,",
    "lifetime and its @xmath32 given by miller & scalo ( 1979 ) , we can also obtain @xmath37yr and @xmath38yr for the ages of ngc1750 and ngc1758 , respectively .",
    "if the relation between @xmath32 and lifetime is chosen as that presented by mermilliod ( 1981 ) , the ages of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 are inferred respectively . all adopted relations in present work are the average results .",
    "the main reasons for these different results are : ( 1 ) the different evolution tracks for stars resulted from different stars evolutionary model ; ( 2 ) the different weight of metalliaities .",
    "combining all these results , we get the average age estimations for ngc1750 and ngc1758 should be @xmath41yr and @xmath42yr , respectively .",
    "it is important to study luminosity functions ( lfs ) and mass functions ( mfs ) of individual open clusters because they can provide information about both the initial mass function ( imf ) and cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "conceptually , the simplest estimation of a cluster luminosity function is to count stars within the cluster . in order to reduce the contamination of field stars ,",
    "the sum of stars membership probabilities in different magnitude bins is one of the best to determine the luminosity functions @xmath43 for individual clusters , i.e. , @xmath44        where @xmath45 is the membership probability of star @xmath46 within the magnitude range of v to @xmath47 .",
    "table  5 and fig .",
    "6 show the lfs for ngc1750 and ngc1758 , respectively .",
    "one can see that there exists a peak for either clusters lfs , which to some extent reflects the complete magnitudes of the samples .",
    "the lf of the core region , which is within the center of @xmath48 , of ngc1750 is also given in fig .",
    "6 as a dotted line .",
    "we did no do the same thing for the ngc1758 because of its small number of member stars within the core .",
    "it is clear that the profiles of luminosity functions in the central and whole observed region for ngc1750 are quite similar , i.e. , there does not exist obvious mass segregation for ngc1750 .",
    "the fact that the dynamical relaxation has not undergone thoroughly is consistent with its relatively young age ( see last subsection ) . combining the observed luminosity functions derived above and the mass - luminosity relations for main sequence stars given by miller and scalo ( 1979 )",
    ", we can infer the present - day mass functions of these two clusters , and the results are listed in table  6 and also shown in fig .",
    "7 respectively . here",
    "the average masses in individual mass bins are weighted by membership probability , and @xmath49 is summed over the stars in each bin as we did for their lfs , i.e. @xmath50 with @xmath51 , here @xmath52 is the star mass with membership probabilities @xmath53 in the mass bin @xmath54 .        * table 5 .",
    "the luminosity functions of + ngc1750 and ngc1758 + [ 0.05 mm ] [ tabwater5 ] @xmath55 *    the slopes of the present - day mass functions of the two clusters are obtained by the least - squares linear regression .",
    "the results are shown by means of log - log plots in figure 7 .",
    "the slopes are @xmath56 and @xmath57 with the correlation coefficients of 0.83 and 0.66 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 respectively.both clusters show the negative slopes .",
    "this also implies that they have not suffered the dynamical relaxation , which is consistent with the previous results .",
    "furthermore , based on the m / l relation given by miller & scalo ( 1979 ) , the observed masses in the cluster region can be estimated to be about 390 @xmath58 and 40@xmath58 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 , respectively . here ,",
    "binary stars are not considered , so these results are probably underestimated .    * table 6 .",
    "the mass functions of ngc1750 and ngc1758 + [ 0.05 mm ] [ tabwater6 ] @xmath59 *      we might hope that direct studies of the kinematics of stars in ngc1750 and ngc1758 would reveal the effect of mass and space segregation . a reliable method for studying the kinematics of open clusters",
    "is based on proper motions of the member stars , which are comparatively easy to be obtained . in our sample ,",
    "the average accuracy of proper motions is @xmath60(tzss ) , which corresponds to 1.7@xmath18km@xmath18s@xmath61 for the distance of ngc1750 and 2.5@xmath18km@xmath18s@xmath61 for the distance of ngc1758 .",
    "considering the stars with membership probabilities greater than 0.70 , we estimate the intrinsic proper motion dispersions based on all the stars in the sample using the method outlined by sagar & bhatt ( 1988 ) .",
    "the dependences of the intrinsic velocity dispersions on stellar masses and distances from the cluster centers are listed in table  7 and table  8 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 respectively , where the radial distances of each star is measured from the centers of the two clusters determined by tzss , and n denotes the star number we used .",
    "one can see in table  7 that there is no statistically significant radial dependence of the intrinsic proper motion dispersion @xmath62 .",
    "the values of @xmath62 for different radial shells are almost the same within their uncertainties .",
    "it can also be seen from table  7 that the intrinsic velocity dispersions @xmath63 of different mass groups are almost the same .",
    "this means that the present data provide litter evidences of mass segregations in these two young open clusters , which is consistent with the results we obtained above .",
    "even so , we can find from table 7 that in the core region of ngc1750 @xmath64 , the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the stars with larger mass are smaller than the intrinsic velocities of the stars with smaller mass , there exists some degree of both space and velocity mass segregation in the center region of ngc1750 , where the dynamical relaxation is easy to undergo .",
    "but it is not clear for ngc1758 due to its small number of member stars .    * table 7 .",
    "dependence of intrinsic dispersion in proper motion on stellar mass and radial distance for ngc1750 + [ 0.05 mm ] [ tabwater7 ] @xmath65 *    * table 8 .",
    "dependence of intrinsic dispersion in proper motion on stellar mass and radial distance for ngc1758 + [ 0.05 mm ] [ tabwater8 ] @xmath66 *    to gain information about the isotropy or anisotropy of the velocity distribution , the radial and tangential components @xmath67 , @xmath68 of the intrinsic dispersions of proper motions as a function radius are calculated and listed in table 9 , where the units of radial distance @xmath69 and of proper motion dispersions @xmath62 have been converted into pc and @xmath70 respectively . the computation has been made for stars in the ngc1750 and ngc1758 regions with membership probabilities higher than 0.7 .",
    "it can be found for both clusters that the ratios @xmath71 fluctuate around unity , which implies the absence of any significant evidence of velocity anisotropy . on the other hand , because the number of member stars is small , we can not get any certainly statistical results for ngc1758 , but at least we can conclude that except the center region of ngc1750 , there is no obvious velocity mass segregation or spatial mass segregation among the member stars of ngc1750 , which suggests that this young open cluster has not reached energy equipartition .    *",

    "in the present paper , based on the proper motions , photometries and membership probabilities of individual stars in the region of ngc1750 ( tzss , gjtr ) , we investigate basic astrophysical properties for two dynamically independent open clusters , ngc1750 and ngc1758 .",
    "after detailed discussions on the photometric data and membership probabilities , the analysis samples with star number of 311 and 23 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 are constructed respectively . comparing zams ( mermilliod 1981 ; schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , we obtain the distances for these two clusters of @xmath73pc for ngc1750 and @xmath74pc for ngc1758 with their extinction being considered .",
    "furthermore , many methods for the age determination are adopted to estimate the average ages of @xmath75 and @xmath76 with the observed masses 390@xmath18m@xmath77 and 40@xmath18m@xmath77 for ngc1750 and ngc1758 respectively .    according to the results of membership determination ,",
    "luminosity functions and mass functions are given at the same time .",
    "it can be concluded that there exist no significant mass segregation effects for both clusters , which is consistent with the fact that their dynamical relaxation have not undergone thoroughly .    finally , the velocity distributions of member stars for these two clusters are also discussed .",
    "it is found that both clusters seem to be isotropy in velocity space .",
    "moreover , it is worth nothing that our statistical results could not be enough certain for ngc1758 because of its small number of member stars observed .",
