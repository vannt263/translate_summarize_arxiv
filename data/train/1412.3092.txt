    "i.e. _  the measurements at a fixed time for all @xmath0 positions .",
    "we are now interested in correlations between the time and position series . to study generic features we make an ensemble approach and model these correlations by the doubly correlated wishart model @xcite that depends on two empirical correlation matrices , one for the correlations of the time series and another one for those of the position series .",
