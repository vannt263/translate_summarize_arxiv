    "the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite@xcite states that any analytic solution of einstein s equations in @xmath8-dimensions can be locally embedded in a @xmath9-dimensional ricci - flat manifold .",
    "it was noted@xcite@xcite that this theorem provides a mathematical support to the @xmath10-dimensional space - time - matter ( stm ) theory@xcite@xcite in which the @xmath4 manifold is ricci - flat with @xmath11 while the @xmath1 matter is induced from the @xmath4 vacuum .",
    "many solutions of this type have been studied within the framework of the stm theory . here",
    ", in this paper , we are going to study a class of @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological solutions which was firstly presented by liu and mashhoon@xcite and restudied latter by liu and wesson@xcite .",
    "this class of solutions is algebraically rich because it contains two arbitrary functions of the time @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown@xcite that two major properties characterize these @xmath4 models : firstly , the @xmath1 induced matter could be described by a perfect fluid plus a variable cosmological term , and by properly choosing the two arbitrary functions both the radiation and matter dominated standard frw models could be recovered .",
    "secondly , the big bang singularity of the @xmath1 standard cosmology could be replaced by a big bounce at which the size of the universe is finite and the universe contracts before the bounce and expands after the bounce .",
    "many further studies could be found in literature such as those about the embeddings of the @xmath4 solutions to brane modelsseahra@xcite , about the accelerating expansion and dark energy of the @xmath4 universe@xcite@xcite , and about the isometry between the @xmath4 solutions and @xmath4 black holes@xcite .",
    "we aware that it is the two arbitrary functions that makes the @xmath4 solutions mathematically rich in giving various cosmological models and various normal and non - normal induced matters .",
    "therefore , it is useful to look for physical constraints to fix these two arbitrary functions and to study physical properties of various different solutions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will use the @xmath0 split technique to derive the @xmath1 induced matter . in section iii , we will use four known energy conditions ( strong , weak , null , and dominant ) to study properties of the @xmath1 induced matter .",
    "section iv is a short conclusion .",
    "the @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological solutions read @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two arbitrary functions , @xmath18 is the 3d curvature index ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "because the @xmath4 manifold ( [ line element])-([b ] ) is ricci - flat , we have @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and@xmath23so @xmath20 is related to the @xmath4 curvature .",
    "the general @xmath0 split in stm theory has been given in ref .",
    ", where it was shown that the @xmath24 @xmath4 equations @xmath11 decompose into @xmath25 @xmath1 equations : ten for the @xmath1 ricci tensor , four for the gauss - codazzi equations , and one for the scalar field . for our @xmath4 metric ( [ line element ] )",
    "we see that the @xmath1 hypersurfaces @xmath26 are @xmath27 constant and the normal vectors to @xmath26 are@xmath28so the projection tensor is @xmath29the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath30 , which describes the rate of changes of @xmath26 as it moves in the normal direction , is defined by @xmath31where @xmath32 is the @xmath4 covariant derivative operator . meanwhile , the lapse function @xmath33 and the shift vector @xmath34 .",
    "these greatly simplifies the calculations for @xmath30 . using ( [ n - a ] ) and ( h - ab ) we find@xmath35with @xmath36the @xmath1 ricci tensor @xmath37 on the @xmath1 hypersurface @xmath26 can be expressed in terms of @xmath38 by @xmath39where @xmath40 . substituting the exact @xmath4 solutions ( [ line element ] ) - ( [ b ] ) into ( [ kab3 ] ) to calculate @xmath41 and then using @xmath38 in ( [ 4dricci ] )",
    ", we obtain the non - vanishing components of @xmath37 being @xmath42   .",
    "\\label{r0123}\\end{aligned}\\]]so the @xmath1 einstein tensor @xmath43 @xmath44 become @xmath45according to einstein theory of general relativity , this @xmath46 implies an effective or induced @xmath1 energy - momentum tensor @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 and suppose @xmath49 being described by a perfect fluid with density @xmath2 and pressure @xmath3 , @xmath50where @xmath51 is the @xmath52-velocity with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , then we find @xmath55thus we rederived the same results for the @xmath1 induced matter as those in ref .  . from the @xmath4 solutions ( [ line element ] ) - ( [ b ] ) one can see that if the two arbitrary functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 are specified , the two scale factors @xmath58 and @xmath59 and then the evolution of the universe are fixed immediately .",
    "then the cosmic induced matter @xmath2  and @xmath3 can be calculated with use of ( [ rho , p ] ) . meanwhile ,",
    "the @xmath1 bianchi identities @xmath60 lead to the @xmath1 conservation laws @xmath61 which give@xmath62as is in the standard @xmath1 cosmology .",
    "the energy conditions of einstein s general relativity are designed to extract as much information as possible from the field equations .",
    "they were used in deriving many theorems such as the singularity theoremshowking , the censorship theorem@xcite and so on . in this section ,",
    "we wish to use the energy conditions to study the properties of the induced matter of the @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological solutions ( [ line element ] ) - ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the standard classical energy conditions are the null energy condition ( nec ) , weak energy condition ( wec ) , strong energy condition ( sec ) , and dominant energy condition ( dec ) .",
    "basic definitions of these energy conditions can be found in ref .  .",
    "for the case in cosmology they are@xcite@xcite @xmath63here , for simplicity , we are not going to discuss models which contain more than one components of matter .",
    "we just consider the case where the universe is dominated by just one fluid with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    without loss of generality , we write the equation of state as@xmath64because both @xmath2  and @xmath3 are functions of @xmath5 and @xmath65 in the @xmath4 model , so @xmath6 is , in general , a function of @xmath5 and @xmath65 as well , @xmath66 . substituting ( [ eos ] ) into the four energy conditions ( [ nec ] ) - ( dec ) , we get@xmath67    following previous usage ( see , for example , ref .  - )",
    "we call matter that satisfies all the four energy conditions `` normal '' and call matter that specifically violates the sec `` abnormal '' . and we call matter that violates any one of the four energy conditions `` non - normal '' . in the following",
    "we will discuss both the normal and non - normal matter separately .      for normal matter",
    "all the four standard energy conditions should be satisfied .",
    "we can easily show that ( [ nec - w ] ) - ( [ dec - w ] ) are equivalent to@xmath68with use of these constraints in the @xmath4 induced matter ( [ rho , p ] ) we obtain@xmath69meanwhile , with use of the definition of the proper time , @xmath70 , and the relation @xmath71 , the hubble and deceleration parameters of the @xmath4 solutions are found to be@xmath72using ( [ h , q ] ) in ( [ mu-1 ] ) - ( [ mu-3 ] ) we get@xmath73we find that all the results in ( [ nm ] ) and ( [ hq-1 ] ) - ( [ hq-3 ] ) are completely the same as those in @xmath1 standard fwr cosmology for models dominated by normal matter . and",
    "we also arrive , from ( [ hq-2 ] ) , at a conclusion that _ the expansion of the universe is decelerating if the universe is dominated by normal matter , and so the gravitational force of normal matter is attractive_. this conclusion valid for both the @xmath1 standard frw cosmology and the @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmology .",
    "as we mentioned above that @xmath6 in ( [ eos ] ) is in general not a constant .",
    "now we assume @xmath6 being a constant for simplicity .",
    "( [ rho , p ] ) lead to@xmath74integrating with respect to @xmath5 , we obtain@xmath75and the conservation law([conserv ] ) gives@xmath76let us return to the two arbitrary functions  @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the @xmath4 solutions . from the @xmath4 solution ( [ a ] )",
    "we can see that the second arbitrary function @xmath57  can always be solved out in terms of @xmath77 if we substituting ( [ mu2+k ] ) in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this leaves us a freedom to consider the equation ( [ mu2+k ] ) alone .",
    "recall that the campbell - magaard theorem just says that the @xmath1 solutions of einstein equations can be embedded in a @xmath4 ricci - flat manifold _ _",
    "locally ( _ _ not_globally)_. this reminds us to choose the time @xmath5 in such a way that the coordinate time @xmath5 approaches to the proper time asymptotically for a very large @xmath5 .",
    "consider the @xmath78 case for simplicity .",
    "then , to make @xmath79 , we must have , from ( [ mu2+k]),@xmath80then we get an approximate @xmath4 metric@xmath81this is a class of approximate solutions of the @xmath4 ricci - flat universe while the corresponding exact solutions are given in ( [ mu2+k ] ) and ( rho - a ) .",
    "now we calculate the deceleration parameter @xmath82 .",
    "we find that for both the exact ( with @xmath78 ) and approximate solutions , we get the same result,@xmath83as we mentioned above that the constant @xmath6 takes values from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for normal matter for which @xmath82 takes the values from @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "so the expansion of the universe is decelerating for normal matter",
    ". we should also point out that this approximate solution is actually valid for any values of @xmath6 as we will discuss in the next subsection .",
    "thus we see from ( metricapp ) that the @xmath1 part of the @xmath4 universe asymptotically approaches to that of the standard frw cosmology in the case for a normal induced matter .",
    "let us consider the @xmath4 approximate solution ( [ mu - t ] ) - ( [ metricapp ] ) and their corresponding exact solutions in ( [ mu2+k ] ) and ( [ rho - a ] ) where @xmath6 takes values from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for normal matter .",
    "now we discuss the case for @xmath88 , for which at least one of the four energy conditions must be violated and so the induced matter is non - normal .    from the four energy conditions ( [ nec - w ] ) - ( [ dec - w ] ) we can see that if @xmath7 , sec is violated while nec , wec , and dec are satisfied .",
    "this kind of matter is usually called abnormal matter .",
    "we can also see that if @xmath89 , all the four energy conditions , nec , wec , sec , and dec , are violated . in what follows",
    "we will discuss these two cases separately .",
    "for this case , eq .",
    "( [ q - nonnor ] ) gives that @xmath90 .",
    "so the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "thus we recover the @xmath4 cosmological scaling solution@xcite in which the @xmath1 induced matter is of a quintessence model of scalar field . in the quintessence dark energy model@xcite@xcite , @xmath6 is in the range [ @xmath91 , @xmath85 ] .",
    "so quintessence might be a normal matter if @xmath93 or abnormal matter if @xmath94 .",
    "this conclusion valid in both the @xmath1 standard and @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological models .",
    "for this case we have @xmath95 . note",
    "that from ( [ mu - t ] ) we find that @xmath96 is negative and @xmath97 is decreasing , contrary to the assumption for an expanding universe . to resolve this problem , we find that , without violating their correctness as an approximate solution , the forms of ( [ mu - t ] ) and ( [ metricapp ] ) can be changed to@xmath98and@xmath99thus we recover the @xmath4 attractor solution@xcite in which the @xmath1 induced matter is described by a phantom model of the dark energy . as @xmath5 tends to @xmath100 , the scale factor @xmath77 tends to infinity implying that the universe will undergo a big rip and will expand to infinity within a finite time . here",
    "we see that all the four energy conditions are violated for phantom ,      the @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological models are characterized by having a big bounce instead of a big bang .",
    "now we wish to know what kind of non - normal matter dominated the universe before and during the bounce . to make the discussion easier , we list an exact solution@xcite in the following .",
    "@xmath101    where @xmath102 is a constant . substituting this equation into ( [ a ] ) , ( b ) and ( [ rho , p ] ) , we obtain @xmath103 , \\label{abounce}\\]]@xmath104 ^{2}% \\left [ 1+\\left ( \\frac{y+t_{c}}{t}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] ^{-1 } ,   \\label{bbounce}\\]]and @xmath105 } , \\label{rhobounce}\\]]@xmath106 } -\\frac{1}{% t^{2}\\left [ 1+\\left ( ( y+t_{c})/t\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] } .",
    "\\label{pbounce}\\ ] ]    from eq.([abounce ] ) we can show that the scalar factor @xmath107 has a minimum point at @xmath108at which we have @xmath109here @xmath110 is the big bounce singularity .    in this solution , the time @xmath5 is defined in the range @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "generally , @xmath5 is not the proper time .",
    "however , when @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "so the coordinate time @xmath5 tends to the proper time for very large @xmath5 .",
    "the bounce is at @xmath116 . before the bounce means for @xmath117 .",
    "when @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 and @xmath120 . when changed to the proper time @xmath121 , we find @xmath122 .",
    "so @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath123 and @xmath119 .    from this solution",
    "we can show that before the bounce ( for @xmath117 ) we have@xmath124we find that before the bounce all the four energy conditions , nec , wec , sec , and dec , are violated .",
    "meanwhile , because @xmath125 and @xmath126 , so @xmath127 .",
    "so , before the bounce , the non - normal induced matter has a large negative value and generates a repulsive force .",
    "then the bounce could be explained as due to this repulsive force and the induced matter could be explained as a phantom .",
    "we can also shown that for @xmath128 , we have @xmath125 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "so nec , wec and sec are satisfied while dec is violated . during this period ,",
    "the induced cosmic matter is perhaps a super - luminal acoustic matter .",
    "in this paper we have used the @xmath0 split to derive the @xmath1 induced energy - momentum tensor of the @xmath4 ricci - flat cosmological solutions .",
    "then we have used the four energy conditions , nec , wec , sec , and dec , to discuss the physical properties of the induced matter and the various solutions of the @xmath4 models .",
    "firstly , we have shown that if the universe is dominated by normal matter , the expansion of the universe is decelerating and the @xmath1 part of the @xmath4 ricci - flat universe approaches asymptotically to the @xmath1 standard frw models in late times of the universe .",
    "if the universe is dominated by quintessence , the induced matter could be normal or abnormal , depending on the value of @xmath6 . if @xmath133 , all the four energy conditions are satisfied and the quintessence is a normal matter . if @xmath134 , only the sec is violated and so in this range the quintessence is abnormal and the expansion of the universe is accelerating . for phantom , all the four energy conditions are violated .",
    "we also find that before the bounce all the four energy conditions are violated , and so the induced matter could be explained as phantom and the bouncing could be explained as due to the repulsive force of the phantom . in the early time after the bounce , dec is violated while the other three are satisfied , so the induced cosmic matter in this period could be explained as a super - luminal acoustic matter .",
