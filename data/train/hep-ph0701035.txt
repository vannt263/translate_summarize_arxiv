    "nature may contain many more particles than are implied by what we consider at first thought to be well - motivated ideas of new physics .",
    "this is especially true if our mindset is entirely on trying to understand electroweak symmetry breaking in the most minimal framework that we can devise .",
    "there are many things to explain in nature beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is merely one of them .    in the search for beyond standard model ( sm ) physics , hidden sector sm singlet fields",
    "are ubiquitous in many existing theories , such as in string - inspired particle physics models containing many more gauge groups and corresponding scalar sectors than would otherwise be needed to describe or contain the sm . even without these more practical motivations , it is always reasonable to imagine such a ` phantom ' world and how it can influence the physics of our sm world , since no present experimental data rules out its existence , and we know so little definitively about the higgs sector .    it would be interesting to pursue whether we can find evidence for the hidden sector at the lhc .",
    "in many scenarios , hidden sector fields couple to the sm fields only through non - renormalizable terms or loop effects . in these cases , the discovery of these fields seems not very promising and they may end up to be truly ` hidden ' at colliders .",
    "fortunately , there are two renormalizable interactions between the hidden sector and the sm fields .",
    "the first one is the mixing between @xmath0 and the @xmath1 through the kinetic term @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the field strengths of the two abelian fields , respectively .",
    "this consideration leads to @xmath4 physics , which has been well studied@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the phenomenology of the other possibility which applies to more general hidden gauge structure ( not just abelian groups ) : the renormalizable interaction of the sm higgs with the hidden sector higgs .",
    "there are few ways that the sm fields can interact with the hidden sector or phantom sector fields , and the higgs boson , which can form a gauge - invariant dimension-2 operator all on its own , is a prime candidate to pursue this connection  @xcite .    concretely , the analysis in this paper is based on the model presented in @xcite , where the sm higgs @xmath5 couples to a hidden scalar @xmath6 through the renormalizable term @xmath7 .",
    "we also assume that the hidden sector has a rich gauge theory structure which is at least partly broken by @xmath8 .",
    "a nontrivial vev of @xmath6 is necessary for the mass mixing between the sm higgs and @xmath6 , which results in two mass eigenstates , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "it is this mixing that brings in the two possible distinct signatures at the lhc which are of primary interest in this paper : a narrow width trans - tev higgs boson and the observable @xmath11 decay .",
    "here is the outline of what follows . in section 2",
    ", we give a brief review of the model we will analyze . in section 3 , we study the bounds on higgs masses for this model , based on the considerations of perturbative unitarity , triviality and precision electroweak measurements .",
    "we find that the canonical constraints on the upper limit of the higgs mass do not apply for the heavier higgs boson @xmath10 because of the mixing effect .",
    "based on the results of the earlier sections , we propose two possible intriguing features to be probed at future colliders : narrow trans - tev higgs boson and @xmath11 decay width . in section 4",

    "however , for the heavier higgs boson in the spectrum , the bound is loosened : for small mixing it can be as high as 15 tev given our parameter ranges ( in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we cut the upper limit at 2 tev to reduce the size of the graph as well as improve the presentability of the graph ) , for medium mixing can be above 1 tev  both are well above the canonical upper limit of the higgs boson mass based on unitarity considerations . for large",
    "mixing limit , the canonical 700 gev bound applies for both of the physical higgs .",
    "these observations agree with our intuition .",
    "the intermediate mixing region is of significant phenomenological interest , since it can not only generate a heavy higgs boson  especially a trans - tev higgs which is not well anticipated by the experiments , yet may be worth attention  but also can produce the heavy higgs boson at a considerable production rate at colliders ( we know that the coupling of @xmath10 to sm particles is proportional to @xmath75 ) .",
    "that is why we amplify the plot for the medium mixing region in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to demonstrate the bound shape more clearly . meanwhile , the small mixing region can also be interesting , since as @xmath75 decreases , the decay width narrows down which is good for detection , although the production rate gets lower .",
    "based on the considerations described above , we choose 3 typical points from those that are allowed by all the perturbative unitarity bounds and can generate a trans - tev higgs : points a , b and c , as we listed in table 1 at the end of section 2 .",

    "point a and b are from medium mixing region ( @xmath77 for point a is actually the maximum mixing angle that can allow a @xmath78 larger than 1.1 tev among all the points that satisfy unitarity constraints ) , point c is from the small mixing region .",
    "we will make precision electroweak analysis for these 3 points in section 3.3 and study the collider physics of trans - tev higgs bosons in section 4.1 .      besides perturbative unitarity ,",
    "triviality and vacuum stability are two additional concerns which impose theoretical constraints on the higgs mass .",
    "now we want to see if they would put more stringent bounds on the higgs mass than those given by unitarity . in the sm ,",
    "both of them are actually relevant to the properties of the parameter @xmath79 at the high scale , which are analyzed using the rg equation of @xmath79 .",
    "the triviality bound is given based on the requirement that the landau pole of @xmath79 from the low - scale theory perspective is above the scale of new physics .",
    "the vacuum stability bound is given based on the requirement that @xmath79 remains positive up to the scale of new physics .",
    "now we already can see that the bounds derived from these two considerations are not definite , as they depend on the scale of new physics .",
    "in the sm , the bounds for the value of @xmath79 at the electroweak scale are equivalent to the upper and lower limits for higgs boson because of the simple proportion relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 . as reviewed in  @xcite , for a @xmath82 new physics scale , @xmath83 .",
    "( this is actually a rough estimation based on 1-loop rge and without taking into threshold corrections .",
    "more accurate analysis would be subtle . )",
    "however , it is easy to tell that these constraints do not apply for our model where the physical higgs spectra are determined by four input parameters @xmath84 , not just @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , we need to first derive the rg equations for all these four parameters and see what we can say for the higgs mass bounds based on them .    here",
    "we give the 1-loop results . for convenience , we suppose that the rges run above the ewsb scale , so that all the masses are zero and we can safely work with gauge eigenstates .",
    "( actually , as is well known , the rges of dimensionless couplings are independent of mass parameters , which supports the validity of our assumption . )",
    "1-loop rge for @xmath79 in the sm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the addition of the hidden sector higgs boson contributes another term to the rge , which results from the mixing term in the lagrangian @xmath85 ( @xmath86 runs in the loop ) .",

    "the first term comes from the interaction between @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath38 , there is also a 1-loop contribution from the graph where @xmath92 runs in the loop .",
    "the other terms in the rge of @xmath38 come from the self - interactions in the hidden sector , e.g. the coupling between @xmath91 and the hidden sector matter  we denote all these terms by @xmath39 .",
    "the result is @xmath93    the rge of @xmath94 involves only two graphs : with @xmath92 or @xmath91 running in the loop .",
    "we eventually get : @xmath95 \\label{eta}\\ ] ] we can see from eqs.([lambda])-([eta ] ) that the perturbative properties of @xmath79 , @xmath38 and @xmath94 can be nice although they are model dependent . however , we can hardly draw any quantitative conclusions regarding , especially , the higgs masses bounds ",
    "they depend on four unknown parameters , the detailed content of hidden sector matter represented by parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 , threshold corrections , etc .",
    "all of these uncertainties make the prediction for the triviality and stability bounds quite model dependent .",
    "meanwhile , such large freedom allows us to reasonably expect that the points that satisfy the unitarity conditions are also allowed by triviality and stability constraints in a large region of full parameter space ( with parameters for hidden sector itself included ) .",
    "a practical application of this observation is that now we can reasonably assume that the points from section 3.1 can also pass the test of triviality and vacuum stability .",
    "precision electroweak measurements also give indirect bounds on the higgs boson mass based on the fact that the virtual excitations of the higgs boson can contribute to physical observables , e.g. w boson mass , considered in precision tests of the sm .",
    "for the one doublet higgs boson in the sm , precision ew analysis puts a 200 gev upper limit at @xmath96 c.l  @xcite .",
    "here we do not plan to make a full analysis to derive the mass bounds in a general way .",
    "alternatively , we focus on the point a , b and c , of which we have made an @xmath97 analysis to see if they can satisfy the constraints from experiments .",
    "this is actually a way to check for our model the ` existence ' of the points allowed by precision ew measurements .",
    "the relevant calculations are analogous to those for the sm higgs boson .",
    "we just need to double the number of involved graphs , since there are two higgs bosons now , and put @xmath75 or @xmath98 on some vertices .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for points a , b and c are consistent with @xcite :  ( s , t)=(0.05,-0.10 ) ,   b :  ( s , t)=(0.02,-0.06 ) ,   c :  ( s , t)=(-0.01,-0.01 ) and  ( s , t)=(0.01,-0.03 ) ,   2 :  ( s , t)=(0.05,-0.07 ) ,   3 :  ( s , t)=(0.06,-0.09 ) where we have chosen @xmath101 gev as the sm reference point where @xmath102 .",
    "we compare these results with the @xmath97 contour in @xcite which gives the constraints on @xmath103 from the most recent precision electroweak measurements . point c is on the boundary of the allowed region , and therefore satisfies the precision ew constraints .",
    "points 1 - 3 , a and b seem to be mildly out of the 68% c.l .  allowed region . according to the direction of their shifts relative to the center of the contour",
    ", they have the same effects as a heavy higgs in the sm .",
    "however , contributions from the unspecified elements of the model  in particular the @xmath4 contributions  can compensate the effect of a heavy higgs by pulling the @xmath103 back towards the center@xcite .",
    "it is easy to tell that such a solution could also apply to our model by the @xmath4 from its @xmath1 hidden sector gauge symmetry .",
    "therefore , now we can come to the conclusion that all the three interesting points can satisfy all the known theoretical bounds on higgs mass under a few reasonable assumptions .",
    "the next step is to send them to the collider physics analysis so that we can tell whether we can discover such interesting phenomenology in future experiments .",
    "in this section , we consider phenomenological implications for new physics searches at the lhc . in our framework , we have two higgs bosons that are in general mixtures of a sm higgs boson and a higgs boson that carries no charges under the sm gauge groups .",
    "thus , no state is precisely a sm higgs boson and no state is precisely of a singlet nature . more importantly , by construction , neither @xmath10 nor @xmath9 have full sm higgs couplings to any state in the sm .",
    "production rates are therefore always reduced for @xmath9 or @xmath10 compared to the sm higgs .    reduced production cross - sections present a challenge for lhc discovery and study .",
    "depending on the mass of the sm higgs boson , there are already significant difficulties for discovery without the additional worry of reduced couplings .",
    "nevertheless , opportunities present themselves as well . for one",
    ", the reduced production cross - section also correlates with a more narrow - width scalar state .",
    "the width of the sm higgs boson grows so rapidly with its mass ( by cubic power ) that by the time its mass is above @xmath104 the higgs boson width is so large that it begins to lose meaning as a particle .",
    "reduced couplings , and therefore a reduced width , of a heavy higgs boson can bring it into the fold of familiar , narrow - width particles .",
    "we study this point below to demonstrate that even a higgs boson with mass greater than @xmath82 ( i.e. , a trans - tev higgs boson ) can be searched for and found at the lhc in this scenario .",
    "another attempt at turning a negative feature into a new angle for searching , is to accept that two heavily mixed higgs states could exist , and search for the decay of the heavier one to the lighter .",
    "these @xmath105 decays could be copious enough that the first discovery of the higgs boson would be through the simultaneous discovery of @xmath10 and @xmath9 via @xmath10 production followed by @xmath105 .",

    ", we have investigated a renormalizable interaction between the sm higgs boson and a higgs boson of a hidden sector .",
    "this gives us one of the most incisive methods to probe the existence of states that have no sm gauge charges .",
    "the phenomenological challenge to this scenario is that all couplings of the mixed higgs bosons are less than the would - be sm couplings for a sm higgs boson of the same mass .",
    "however , small compensating advantages were exploited here : a reduced coupling means a reduced width , which turns a trans - tev higgs boson into a definable narrow - width state to search for , and the existence of two higgs bosons enables us to search for decays of the heavier higgs boson to the lighter one . in both cases",
    ", we were able to study examples from the parameter space of discovery .",
    "we therefore like to emphasize the importance of doing searching for a higgs boson in standard channels well into the trans - tev mass region .",
    "we also like to reemphasize , from the point of view of these hidden sector ideas , that there is a potential opportunity to discover both a heavy higgs boson and a light higgs boson through @xmath105 decays .",
