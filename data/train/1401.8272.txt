    "it is a great honor for me to be invited at the seventh international conference on geometry and topology of manifolds , dedicated to the mathematical legacy of charles ehresmann .",
    "i enjoyed with great pleasure the hospitality of the mathematical research and conference center of the polish academy of sciences , and i address my warmest thanks to the organizers and to the supporting institutions .    around 1923 , lie cartan  @xcite introduced the notion of an _ affine connection _ on a manifold .",
    "that notion was previously used , in a less general setting , by h.  weyl  @xcite and rests on the idea of parallel transport due to t.  levi - civita  @xcite .    at the very",
    "beginning of @xcite , even before defining explicitly affine connections , lie cartan explains how that concept can be used in newtonian and einsteinian mechanics .",
    "he shows that the _ principle of inertia _ ( which is at the foundations of mechanics ) , according to which a material point particle , when no forces act on it , moves along a straight line with a constant velocity , can be expressed locally by the use of an affine connection . under that form ,",
    "that principle remains valid in ( curved ) einsteinian space - times .",
    "cartan even shows that by a suitable adjustment of the connection , a gravity force ( that means , an acceleration field ) can be accounted for , and becomes a part of the geometry of space - time .",
    "that result expresses the famous _ equivalence principle _ used by einstein for the foundations of general relativity . as shown by cartan",
    ", it is valid for newtonian mechanics as well .",
    "then lie cartan presents a thorough geometric study of affine connections ; he defines their curvature and torsion , and discusses the parallel displacement of a frame along a closed loop .",
    "he introduces euclidean , galilean and minkowskian connections , for which the group of affine transformations is replaced by a suitable subgroup . in @xcite he introduces more general types of connections associated to transformation groups which are no more subgroups of the group of affine transformations .",
    "cartan s ideas were fully formalized by charles ehresmann in the framework of connections on fibre bundles , which he introduced in @xcite .    in section  2",
    "we briefly present cartan s intuitive ideas about connections .",
    "then in section  3 we describe ehresmann connections on fibre bundles , and in section  4 cartan connections as seen by ehresmann . in section  5",
    "we present with more details examples of cartan connections , including affine , projective and conformal connections . in section  6 , following cartan , we show how a gravitational force can be included in the geometry of space - time by the use of a suitable connection , and we briefly present other applications of connections : geometric quantization , phases in mechanics , nonholonomic or active constraints , maxwell s equations , yang - mills fields .",
    "cartan writes in @xcite : une varit  connexion affine est une varit qui , au voisinage immdiat de chaque point , a tous les caractres dun espace affine , et pour laquelle on a une loi de reprage des domaines entourant deux points infiniment voisins  : cela veut dire que si , en chaque point , on se donne un systme de coordonnes cartsiennes ayant ce point pour origine , on connat les formules de transformation ( de mme nature que dans lespace affine ) qui permettent de passer dun systme de rfrence  tout autre systme de rfrence dorigine infiniment voisine .",
    "approximate translation : a manifold with an affine connection is a manifold whose properties , in the neighborhood of each point , are those of an affine space , and on which there is a law for fitting together the neighborhoods of two infinitesimally nearby points : it means that if , on a neighborhood of each point , we have chosen cartesian coordinates with that point as origin , we know the transformation formulae ( of the same nature as those valid in an affine space ) which allow to go from a reference frame to another reference frame with an infinitesimally nearby origin .    in fact , given a smooth manifold @xmath2 ,",
    "it is not on a neighborhood of each point @xmath3 that cartan considers a local affine structure .",
    "rather , at each point @xmath3 , he considers the tangent space @xmath4 endowed with its natural affine space structure . and he writes : la varit sera dite  _ connexion affine _",
    "lorsquon aura dfini ,",
    "dune manire dailleurs arbitraire , une loi permettant de reprer lun par rapport  lautre les espaces affines attachs  deux points infiniment voisins quelconques @xmath5 et @xmath6 de la varit ; cette loi permettra de dire que tel point de lespace affine attach au point @xmath6 correspond  tel point de lespace affine attach au point @xmath5 , que tel vecteur du premier espace est parallle ou quipollent  tel vecteur du second espace . en particulier le point @xmath6 lui - mme sera repr par rapport  lespace affine du point @xmath5 @xmath7 .",
    "approximate translation : the manifold will be said to be endowed with an _ affine connection _ once we have defined , in an arbitrary way , a law allowing to localize one with respect to the other the affine spaces attached to two infinitesimally nearby points @xmath5 and @xmath6 of that manifold ; that law will tell us which point of the affine space attached to @xmath6 corresponds to a given point of the space attached to @xmath5 , and will tell us whether a vector living in the first space is parallel , or equipollent , to a vector living in the second space ; in particular , the point @xmath6 itself will be localized in the affine space attached to @xmath5 @xmath7 .",
    "cartan then explains with more details how to define an affine connection on a @xmath8-dimensional manifold @xmath2 ; of course his definition extends easily to manifolds of any dimension .",
    "he considers , at each point @xmath3 , an affine frame of the affine tangent space @xmath4 , with as origin the point @xmath5 itself ( identified with the null vector at @xmath5 ) , and with the linear basis @xmath9 as basis . in order to define the law which links the affine spaces tangent to the manifold @xmath2 at two infinitesimally nearby points @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    ", he write the relations @xmath10    these equations mean that the point @xmath6 , origin of @xmath11 , infinitesimally near @xmath5 , must be identified with the point @xmath12 of the affine space @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the vectors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 of @xmath11 must be identified with the vectors @xmath16 of @xmath4 .",
    "equations @xmath17 must be understood as equalities between differential @xmath18-forms on a @xmath19-dimensional space with , as coordinates , the @xmath8 coordinates which specify a point on @xmath2 , and @xmath20 more coordinates on which depend the affine frames of a @xmath8-dimensional affine space .",
    "in fact , these differential @xmath18-forms live on the principal bundle of affine frames of the affine tangent spaces to the maniflold @xmath2 .",
    "the meaning of equations @xmath17 is the following : let @xmath21 be an affine frame of the affine tangent space @xmath4 and let @xmath22 be a vector tangent at @xmath23 to the space of affine frames .",
    "the infinitesimal displacement of that affine frame defined by the vector @xmath22 is parallel , with respect to the connection , if and only if @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the @xmath18-form of the connection ( in the sense of ehresmann , as introduced later ) .",
    "equation @xmath24 , when explicitly written , leads to the @xmath20 scalar equations @xmath17 because the @xmath18-form @xmath25 takes its values in the @xmath20-dimensional lie algebra of the group of affine transformations of @xmath26 .",
    "this will become clear with the works of charles ehresmann  @xcite .",
    "euclidean connections , galilean connections , minkowskian connections , @xmath7 , considered by cartan , appear as special cases of affine connections , obtained by replacing the group of affine transformations of an affine space by an appropriate subgroup .",
    "for example , on a @xmath8-dimensional manifold @xmath2 endowed with a riemannian metric @xmath27 , instead of general affine frames @xmath21 with the contact point @xmath5 as origin of the affine tangent space @xmath4 , cartan considers only orthonormal frames , which satisfy @xmath28 now the dimension of the space of orthonormal affine frames is 9 ( instead of 15 for the space of general affine frames ) . by differentiation of the above relations we see that the @xmath18 forms @xmath29 and @xmath30 of equations @xmath17 must satisfy @xmath31 only 6 of the 12 scalar equations @xmath17 are now independent ( in agreement with the dimension , 6 , of the lie algebra of the group of affine orthogonal transformations of @xmath26 ) .",
    "other types of connections were defined and discussed by  .",
    "cartan  @xcite , with transformation groups which are no more subgroups of the group of affine transformations : conformal connections , projective connections , @xmath7 the general idea underlying the notions of such connections on a manifold @xmath2 is to use , as a local model of that manifold , an homogeneous space of the same dimension as @xmath2 .",
    "a copy of that homogeneous space is attached at each point of the manifold , and considered as tangent  at that point to the manifold .",
    "the connection is essentially a law which indicates how these homogeneous spaces are glued together .",
    "of course , affine connections appear as the special case in which the homogeneous space which is attached to each point of the manifold is an affine space , more precisely the affine space tangent to the manifold at that point .    for conformal connections on an @xmath32-dimensional manifold ,  .",
    "cartan  @xcite writes : attachons  chaque point @xmath33 de cette varit un espace conforme  @xmath32 dimensions , @xmath7 la varit sera dite _  connexion conforme _",

    ", cartan writes : lide fondamentale se rattache  la notion de _ paralllisme _ que m.  t.  levi - civita a introduite de manire si fconde .",
    "les nombreux auteurs qui ont gnralis la thorie des espaces mtriques sont tous partis de lide fondamentale de m.  levi - civita , mais , semble - t - il , sans pouvoir la dtacher de lide de _ vecteur_. cela na aucun inconvnient quand il sagit de varits  connexion affine @xmath7 mais cela semblait interdire tout espoir de fonder une thorie _ autonome _ de varits  connexion conforme ou projective .",

    "the many authors who genralized the theory of metric spaces all started from the fundamental idea of m.  levi - civita , but , seemingly , without freeing it from the idea of _ vector_. that does not matter as long as one deals with manifolds with affine connections @xmath7 but that seemed to forbid any hope to build an _ autonomous _ theory of manifolds with conformal or projective connections .",
    "in fact , the main thing in m.  levi - civita s idea is that it allows to glue together two small , infinitesimally nearby pieces of a manifold , and it is that idea of gluing which is most fruitful .",

    ", the parameters vary slowly , describe a closed loop in the space of values of the parameters , and after taking again their initial values , remain constant .",
    "the motion of the system becomes again quasi - periodic on the same lagrangian torus , but with a change of phase ( the hannay and berry phase ) .",
    "this change of phase is interpreted as the holonomy of an ehresmann connection in the works of marsden , montgomery and ratiu  @xcite .",
    "several different approaches have been used for the mathematical description of mechanical systems with constraints . in one of these approaches",
    ", the configuration space of the system is a smooth manifold and the constraints are described by a vector ( or sometimes an affine ) sub - bundle @xmath42 of the tangent bundle @xmath428 .",
    "the admissible motions of the system are smooth curves @xmath48 in @xmath345 such that , for all @xmath56 , @xmath429    j.  koiller  @xcite considered systems where the configuration space @xmath345 is the total space of a principal bundle over a base @xmath36 , with a lie group @xmath0 as structure group , and where the constraint @xmath42 is a connection on that principal bundle .",
    "let us consider a mechanical system in which some geometric constraints can be acted on , as a function of time , in order to control the motion of the system .",
    "for example , a cat in free fall can change the shape of her body to try ( generally with success ) to reach the ground on her feet .    for the mathematical description of such systems  @xcite",
    ", we use a manifold @xmath345 as configuration space , and a smooth submersion @xmath430 onto another manifold @xmath431 ( the space of shapes of the cat s body , or more generally the space of possible states of the active constraint ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of the system ( other than those used to change the value of the active constraint ) are described by a lagrangian @xmath432 .",
    "let @xmath433 be the dual bundle of the vertical sub - bundle @xmath434 .",
    "we can identify @xmath433 with the quotient bundle @xmath435 .",
    "let @xmath436 , @xmath437 and @xmath438 be the projections . when the lagrangian @xmath439 is @xmath440 there is on the bundle @xmath441 an ehresmann connection ( called the dynamical connection ) which can be used to determine the way in which an infinitesimal change of the state of the active constraint , represented by a vector tangent to @xmath431 , affects the motion of the mechanical system .",
    "let us call _ kinetic connection _ the ehresmann connection , on the bundle @xmath430 , for which the horizontal lift at @xmath442 of a vector @xmath443 is the unique @xmath444 , orthogonal ( with respect to @xmath27 ) to the vertical subspace @xmath445 , such that @xmath446 .",
    "the dynamic connection is characterized by the two properties :    ( iii )    the horizontal lift at @xmath447 of a vector @xmath448 with respect to the dynamical connection projects on @xmath345 onto the horizontal lift at @xmath449 of @xmath334 with respect to the kinetic connection ;    the horizontal lift to @xmath433 of any smooth vector field on @xmath431 , with respect to the dynamical connection , is an infinitesimal automorphism of the poisson structure of @xmath433 .",
    "the famous maxwell s equations are usually written ( see for example  @xcite ) @xmath450 where @xmath451 is the electric field , @xmath452 the magnetic induction , @xmath453 the diplacement current , @xmath454 the magnetic field , @xmath455 the electric charge density and @xmath456 the current density .",
    "moreover there are constitutive equations which link @xmath451 and @xmath453 , @xmath452 and @xmath454 , @xmath457    let us introduce the @xmath458-form on space - time ( in which @xmath459 are the coordinates , with respect to some galilean reference frame , some chosen units of time and length and some orthonormal frame in space ) @xmath460 and @xmath461 let us set @xmath462    then we have @xmath463 where @xmath464 is the hodge operator on the @xmath465-dimensional pseudo - riemannian manifold space - time .    the velocity of light in vacuum is @xmath466    maxwell s equations become @xmath467    maxwell s equations can be made even more beautiful : the electromagnetic @xmath458-form @xmath37 on space - time can be considered as the curvature form of a connection on a principal bundle , with space - time as base and the circle @xmath468 as structure group ( this idea was first introduced by h.  weyl  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath458-form @xmath37 should then be considered as taking its values in the lie algebra @xmath469 of @xmath470 .",
    "the connection form @xmath471 such that @xmath472 , is not unique : we may add a closed @xmath18-form ( gauge transformation ) .",
    "the first maxwell s equation , @xmath473 , is automatically satisfied .",
    "the second maxwell s equation becomes @xmath474 where @xmath318 is the covariant exterior differential operator .",
    "gauge theories generalize maxwell s theory of electromagnetism written in terms of connections .",
    "they use a principal bundle with space - time as base and a non - abelian group as structure group ( @xmath475 in the so - called _ standard model _ ) .",
    "they introduce a connection @xmath18-form @xmath471 on that bundle and lead , for the curvature form @xmath37 of the connection , to field equations similar to maxwell s equations : @xmath476 and @xmath477 where @xmath478 is the covariant differential with respect to the connection @xmath471 and @xmath479 a current  which generalizes the @xmath465-dimensional current density of maxwell s theory .",
