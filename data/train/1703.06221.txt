    "the importance and utility of the cgl fluid model derived by chew goldberger and low @xcite that represents the simplest but nevertheless rigorous generalization of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) for collisionless plasmas , is often underestimated and misunderstood by the heliospheric community in general and by the solar wind community in particular . based on an over - simplified analysis of only the mean quantities ( where the dispersion relations for the fluctuations are disregarded ) , it is often erroneously claimed that the cgl model predicts an extremely large proton temperature anisotropy far from unity , contradicting observational data showing that the solar wind plasma is bounded by the kinetic firehose and mirror instabilities .",
    "it is then typically concluded that fluid models , such as the cgl model and its generalizations are not particularly useful in studying plasmas with anisotropic temperatures .",
    "this erroneous claim - that the cgl model predicts extremely large temperature anisotropies - is so omni - present in the solar wind literature , that we are inclined to call it the myth of the cgl description .",
    "the motivation for this paper is to dispel this myth and to show briefly that the simple cgl fluid model is actually a very useful first - order description for plasmas with anisotropic temperatures such as the solar wind , since the model captures many first - order anisotropic effects and in fact does not allow extremely large temperature anisotropies .",
    "here we concentrate only on the parallel and oblique firehose instability , which are two of the four basic instabilities typically considered in solar wind observational studies and in numerous theoretical developments and numerical simulations , the other two being the mirror instability and the ion - cyclotron anisotropy instability ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "that the cgl model contains the correct parallel and oblique firehose instability threshold is already known from the work of @xcite and the cgl dispersion relations were further studied for example by @xcite .",
    "the mirror instability and the ion - cyclotron anisotropy instability , are not considered here . from a fluid perspective",
    ", a lot of attention has been paid especially to the mirror instability , where the cgl description is known to have a factor of 6 error in the temperature threshold for high plasma beta values .",
    "the mirror instability is typically a highly oblique instability and the modern landau fluid description ( @xcite , and references therein ) that incorporates landau damping and sophisticated finite larmor radius ( flr ) corrections captures the entire mirror instability growth rate with excellent accuracy .",
    "considering only the mirror threshold ( and not the full wavenumber dependent growth rate ) , the erroneous mirror threshold in the cgl model can also be corrected by simpler fluid models that contain the fluctuating heat flux equations and do not contain landau damping @xcite .",
    "the parallel and oblique firehose instabilities , even though present in the above cited modern landau fluid description , are usually addressed only very briefly . for quasi - parallel propagation directions",
    "the higher - order ion - cyclotron damping ( in contrast to first order landau damping ) becomes an important collisionless damping mechanism and even sophisticated landau fluid models that are very precise for a more oblique propagation angles , can describe the the growth rate of the firehose instability only approximately .",
    "here we consider only very simple fluid models based on the cgl description without any form of collisionless damping , the only extensions are the hall - term and the flr corrections , both of which allow us to explore the firehose instability in sufficient detail .",
    "the firehose instability in a fluid formalism was also investigated by @xcite and references therein .",
    "the nonlinear hall - cgl model that we use here reads @xmath1 where the proton pressure tensor @xmath2 .",
    "since we consider that only protons contribute to the pressure , we dropped the usual proton index p. the @xmath3 is the unit vector in the direction of the local magnetic field and the @xmath4 is the finite larmor radius ( flr ) pressure tensor . if the flr tensor is neglected and only the first term on the right hand side of the induction equation ( [ eq : cgl_b ] ) is considered , the classical cgl model is recovered . like mhd",
    ", cgl is length - scale invariant .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of the induction equation represents the hall term and introduces dispersive effects .",
    "the dispersive effects are further refined by the flr pressure tensor .",
    "the model is based on numerous approximations .",
    "it is assumed that the plasma consists of only protons and electrons , that it is charge neutral , that the displacement current is neglected , the electrons are cold , electron inertia is neglected , and the proton heat flux is neglected . the flr stress forces that enter the pressure equations nonlinearly and that are responsible for stochastic heating are neglected .",
    "nevertheless , this very simplified fluid model is completely sufficient to demonstrate our point . with the hall - term present in the induction equation , the pressure equations ( [ eq : pparcgl_cl ] ) , ( [ eq : pperpcgl_cl ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the convective derivative .",
    "if the hall term is absent in the induction equation , the right hand sides of ( [ eq : cgl_c1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cgl_c2 ] ) are zero , which corresponds to the most often cited form of the cgl pressure equations with its representation of the adiabatic invariants . obviously , the pressure equations ( [ eq : pparcgl_cl ] ) , ( [ eq : pperpcgl_cl ] ) are preferred , since these do not depend on the induction equation and are valid regardless of whether the hall term is present or not . moreover , ( [ eq : pparcgl_cl ] ) and ( [ eq : pperpcgl_cl ] ) are much easier to linearize and to work with in general .",
    "it is useful to define the usual alfvn speed @xmath7 , the parallel and perpendicular proton plasma beta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the parallel and perpendicular thermal speeds ( importantly , containing the factor of 2 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 superscript is used to emphasize the mean quantities ( i.e. to distinguish between the mean pressure @xmath12 and the fluctuating pressure @xmath13 ) .",
    "we use the usual convention that the boltzmann constant @xmath14 and define the temperature as @xmath15 . at long wavelengths (",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 ) , i.e. by neglecting the hall - term and the flr corrections , the linearized ( @xmath18 ) cgl model yields forward and backward propagating oblique alfvn modes satisfying the dispersion relation @xmath19 when the expression under the square root becomes negative the _ oblique firehose instability _ is obtained and the threshold can be rewritten in many forms , for example @xmath20 the necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the instability to develop is @xmath21 .",
    "the first expression directly implies that if @xmath22 , no firehose instability can exist ( at these long spatial scales ) .",
    "the firehose instability therefore exists only for relatively high plasma beta values @xmath23 and only if the background parallel temperature @xmath24 is higher than the perpendicular temperature @xmath25 .",
    "the _ parallel firehose instability _ is the instability of the quasi - parallel whistler mode , and in the parallel propagation limit the threshold is identical to ( [ eq : firehose ] ) . for simplicity , here we first consider only the parallel firehose instability for strictly parallel propagation since the quasi - parallel case requires a longer discussion and will be discussed later in the text .",
    "the `` hard '' firehose instability threshold ( [ eq : firehose ] ) obtained from the cgl model is equivalent to the one found from linear kinetic theory , which is well known ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the parallel firehose instability is usually a propagating instability ( i.e. has a nonzero real frequency ) and the oblique firehose instability is usually a non - propagating instability . in the following figures , where we compare the solutions of linear",
    "kinetic theory obtained with the whamp code and the solutions of the hall - cgl fluid model , we arbitrarily choose @xmath26 .",
    "this choice is not very convenient since for such a high plasma beta a strong ion - cyclotron damping is found ( which is absent in the fluid models that we discuss ) which leads to a less precise match between fluid and kinetic results . however , we want to demonstrate our point without resorting to specially tuned cases .",
    "the choice of @xmath26 is convenient in that the firehose threshold is nicely defined with @xmath27 .",
    "without loss of generality , we consider propagation in the x - z plane , where the mean magnetic field @xmath28 is in the z - direction .",
    "propagation in the x - z plane prescribes that in all expressions @xmath29 .",
    "here we additionally consider strictly parallel propagation for which @xmath30 .",
    "for parallel propagation the sound / ion - acoustic mode decouples from the rest of the system with the dispersion relation @xmath31 , and the parallel sound speed @xmath32 .",
    "the dispersion of this mode does not depend on the hall - term .",
    "the dynamics of the other two modes , the ion - cyclotron and the whistler mode , are coupled .",
    "it is useful to define the long - wavelength ( cgl ) phase speed of the parallel alfvn mode as @xmath33 for isotropic temperatures ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 .",
    "linearization of the hall - cgl system in the x - z plane and transformation to fourier space shows that for the parallel propagation @xmath36 and the zero determinant requirement can be conveniently rearranged as @xmath37 of the four solutions , two are @xmath38 and the other two are obtained by substituting @xmath39 with @xmath40 in the above expression . here",
    "we consider only solutions with positive wavenumbers that yield positive frequencies , and which two solutions to pick depends on if the system is in the firehose - stable or in the firehose - unstable region .",
    "if the quantity @xmath41 , i.e. if the system is in a firehose - stable regime , the above solution with the plus sign is the whistler mode ( depicted by the blue dashed line in figures that follow ) and the solution with the minus sign is the ion - cyclotron mode ( red dashed line in the following figures ) .",
    "if the quantity @xmath42 , i.e. if the system is in a firehose - unstable regime , the dispersion relation ( [ eq : hall - w1 ] ) for the whistler mode is still correct , but the ion - cyclotron mode solution ( [ eq : hall - w1 ] ) has to be changed to the mode that was previously backward propagating with @xmath40 , i.e. , solutions in the firehose - unstable region satisfy @xmath43 where the solution with the plus sign is the whistler mode ( blue ) and the solution with the minus sign is the ion - cyclotron mode ( red ) . for isotropic temperatures @xmath34 , the dispersion relations do not depend on the value of @xmath44 , which is a consequence of neglecting the flr pressure corrections , as we discuss later .",
    "the second term in the dispersion relation ( [ eq : hall - wu ] ) is a purely complex number in the region where @xmath45 which can be regarded as a modified hall - cgl firehose instability threshold that is now length - scale dependent . at long spatial scales ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the above criterion is simply the cgl firehose condition . in the region where ( [ eq : hallcgl - firehose ] ) is satisfied , both modes ( [ eq : hall - wu ] ) propagate with the same real frequency , the first term @xmath47 , and both modes have the same absolute value of the imaginary frequency , the second term @xmath48 , and the total frequency @xmath49 .",
    "the important difference is that the whistler mode has a positive growth rate and is unstable , and the ion - cyclotron mode has negative growth rate and is stable and damped . the unstable whistler mode represents the parallel firehose instability . above some critical wavenumber",
    "the left hand side of ( [ eq : hallcgl - firehose ] ) will become positive and the frequency of both modes is then purely real .",
    "the hall - term therefore stabilizes the firehose instability at sufficiently high wavenumbers ( small spatial scales ) .",
    "the results of fluid models are often compared to those from a kinetic description . in discussing `` resonances '' ,",
    "fluid models are typically formulated in a way that singularities are `` removed '' from the dispersion relations ( usually as a consequence of eliminating the electric field when calculating the dispersion relations , although fluid models can be naturally derived also through the electric field eigenmatrix , see for example @xcite ) . the dispersion equation ( [ eq : hall - parf ] ) for parallel propagation is easily expressed as @xmath50 which for the isotropic temperatures ( @xmath34 ) or in the cold plasma limit ( @xmath51 ) simplifies to @xmath52 making it obvious that the simplest ion - cyclotron resonances are present in the hall - cgl description as well .    to better understand what effects are present and what effects are absent in the hall - cgl model , figure 1 shows solutions of the full linear kinetic theory obtained with the whamp code ( assuming a bi - maxwellian distribution function ) . from now on we drop the superscript @xmath11 for the background temperature .",
    "the proton temperature is assumed to be isotropic @xmath53 and the electrons to be cold with @xmath54 ( in the whamp code the value is chosen to be @xmath55 ) . in the whamp code it is necessary to prescribe the ratio of the parallel proton thermal speed to the speed of light ( because the displacement current is present ) and we choose @xmath56 .",
    "the solid lines are the solutions of the kinetic theory with different values @xmath57 .",
    "the blue curve is the whistler mode and the red curve is the ion - cyclotron mode . for isotropic temperatures the solutions of the hall - cgl model",
    "are completely @xmath44 independent and are shown by two dashed curves .",
    "the kinetic solutions for the whistler mode are almost @xmath44 independent and only the mode with @xmath26 deviates from the other whistler solutions , and only between @xmath58 . on the other hand , the ion - cyclotron mode is strongly @xmath44 dependent , partially because of the flr corrections and partially because the mode is strongly ion - cyclotron damped , which is not captured in the fluid models considered here . in the next section , we consider the simple flr corrections and the solutions are shown in figure 1 right ; discussed below .",

    "evidently , for sufficiently low wavenumbers , the hall - cgl model accurately reproduces the real frequency of both modes",
    ". for high wavenumbers only the whistler mode is reproduced reasonably accurately by the hall - cgl model and the ion - cyclotron mode strongly deviates from the kinetic results ( similarly to figure 1 the behavior can be partially reproduced by introducing flr corrections , which we do not show ) . in figure 3 , the temperature anisotropy is varied so that the modes are in a firehose unstable regime and the imaginary phase speed is plotted .",
    "the ion - cyclotron mode is damped and the whistler mode is unstable . at low wavenumbers , the hall - cgl model reproduces the imaginary phase speed very accurately for both modes for all the values of @xmath60 considered . at higher wavenumbers",
    "the firehose instability of the whistler mode is stabilized and in the hall - cgl model this is a consequence of the hall - term .",
    "the stabilization can be improved by considering first - order flr corrections , which is shown in figure 4 . at higher wavenumbers the ion - cyclotron mode experiences strong ion - cyclotron damping in the kinetic description , whereas in the fluid models considered here the damping of the ion - cyclotron mode vanishes at a wavenumber where the whistler firehose instability is stabilized .",

    "the kinetic contours we use here for @xmath96 are the same kinetic countrours as in the left figure 1 of @xcite and the contour values were kindly provided to us by petr hellinger ( private communication ) .",
    "the differences between the fluid and kinetic models can be understood from figure 4 right , where the kinetic solution close to the threshold with @xmath97 shows a large `` bump '' around @xmath98 that deviates significantly from the fluid solution .",
    "we do not present the maximum growth rate associated with the second order flr corrections since the accuracy is not improved by much .",
    "the following discussion applies only to the strictly parallel firehose instability .",
    "the important point that is apparent from figure 4 right is that in the hall - cgl model the imaginary phase speed reaches its maximum at long spatial scales or wavenumbers @xmath99 , and for higher wavenumbers the imaginary phase speed decreases .",
    "this means that the long wavelength limit can be used to decide if the firehose instability exists or not .",

    "right we plotted another solution with @xmath101 , i.e a solution that technically lies in a firehose - stable regime .",
    "the solution is indeed stable ( with zero growth rate ) at small wavenumbers both in the kinetic theory and in the fluid model .",
    "however , the difference is that while the fluid model remains stable for higher wavenumbers , the kinetic solution still develops the firehose instability .",
    "the consequence of this is that kinetic marginally stable states with small @xmath0 can lie below the `` hard '' cgl firehose threshold , further implying that the kinetic firehose instability can exist at finite wavenumbers for plasma beta values slightly below @xmath102 . that kinetic contours for @xmath103 can fall below @xmath102 is clearly visible in figure 7 ( also in figure 1 of @xcite or figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the parallel firehose instability for quasi - parallel propagation angles ( not strictly parallel ) in the hall - cgl model ( and models with flr corrections ) can also reach its maximum imaginary phase speed at a finite range of wavenumbers ( i.e. the imaginary phase speed can be higher than the phase speed obtained in the long - wavelength limit ) , and this is briefly addressed in the next section .",
    "the parallel firehose instability usually reaches its maximum growth rate at @xmath104 .    to clearly show that for a high plasma @xmath44 the stabilization mechanism is mainly due to the flr corrections and not the hall term , in figure 8 we plotted the parallel firehose instability for @xmath105 .",
    "it is shown that even though the hall term in the hall - cgl model ( blue dashed lines ) eventually stabilizes the firehose instability at sufficiently high wavenumbers , the solutions are very far from the kinetic solutions .",
    "in contrast , the hall - cgl - flr1 model ( green dashed lines ) stabilizes the solutions reasonably well .",
    "interestingly , for such a high plasma beta , the strong `` bump '' that was shown in the kinetic imaginary phase speed for @xmath26 ( figure 4 right , when close to the firehose threshold ) is not present here .",

    "are written in steady - state as @xmath142 for a radially expanding solar wind , the density @xmath143 with heliocentric distance @xmath144 , and the radial or azimuthal magnetic field is either @xmath145 , or @xmath146 .",
    "on choosing the radial magnetic field profile , we have @xmath147 the azimuthal magnetic field profile yields @xmath148 there is also a curious case",
    "if the magnetic field profile is assumed to be @xmath149 , i.e. intermediate to @xmath150 and @xmath151 , which yields @xmath152 in ( [ eq : tempcrit ] ) , the temperature anisotropy stays constant .",
    "the results ( [ eq : tempone ] ) and ( [ eq : temptwo ] ) are often interpreted as that the cgl model yields extremely large temperature anisotropies in the radially expanding solar wind .",
    "this simple interpretation is erroneous . for @xmath143 , an interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) dependence steeper than @xmath153 will evolve the system towards the firehose threshold and an imf dependence flatter than @xmath153 towards the mirror threshold . despite not exhibiting all the complexities of the kinetic model ,",
    "the cgl model captures both firehose instabilities properly at sufficiently long spatial scales , and both instabilities are stabilized with the inclusion of the hall term and flr corrections .",
    "although the mirror instability was not addressed here , and despite the simplest mirror threshold being incorrect with respect to kinetic theory ( more elaborate models can rectify the difference with the inclusion of the heat flux ) , a threshold is indeed still present .",
    "therefore , the cgl model will not allow large temperature anisotropies in the expanding solar wind and , regardless of the dominant heating processes , the developing temperature anisotropies will be bounded , if not completely by the same thresholds , just as the kinetic description is bounded .",
    "the same erroneous conclusion would be obtained if the time derivative @xmath154 were neglected in the vlasov equation , i.e. by considering kinetic theory in a steady - state .",
    "instabilities are found from the dispersion relation and prescribing @xmath155 simply implies that the frequency @xmath156 .",
    "the zero frequency condition can be useful in determining some thresholds for nonpropagating instabilities , but one has to specifically derive these solutions from the dispersion relations .",
    "most importantly , instabilities refer to _ fluctuating _ quantities",
    ". the fluctuations will become unstable - with a positive growth rate - when the _ mean _ values of these fluctuations satisfy some relations / thresholds .",
    "for example the oblique alfvn wave ( [ eq : alf ] ) in the cgl description becomes unstable when the firehose threshold ( [ eq : firehose ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is the fluctuations that become unstable , and an analysis of mean / global quantities can not reveal an instability . the very simple calculations ( [ eq : tempone ] ) and ( [ eq : temptwo ] ) above therefore have to be approached with caution , since these calculations can not reveal , by a definition , any instability .",
