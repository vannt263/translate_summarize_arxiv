    "the nature of the interface separating two equilibrium phases , or more generally any two distinct bulk states of matter , is a problem of continuing interest .",
    "while there is in most cases some fuzziness in the transition region , giving rise to an intrinsic structure , the width of this is usually much smaller than ( and therefore separable from ) the fluctuations in the location of the interface .",
    "these fluctuations are fairly well understood both microscopically and macroscopically in ( simple ) equilibrium systems @xcite , but much less is known about them in the larger context of nonequilibrium situations @xcite .",
    "an important advance in the latter case was the introduction of equations of the edwards - wilkinson @xcite and kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite type to describe fluctuations in dynamically moving interfaces .",
    "solutions of these equations appear to describe in a quantitative manner the macroscopic fluctuations of a large class of such interfaces @xcite .",
    "it is probably fair to say , however , that there are few microscopic systems ( even simple ones ) for which one can argue a priori , with mathematical rigor , that their behavior will be described by these equations .",
    "several years ago two of us ( jll and es ) , together with b. derrida and h. spohn @xcite , introduced and studied the behavior of the low - noise - limit sharp interface separating the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases in a simple model nonequilibrium system  the 2d toom cellular automaton .",
    "our semi - infinite interface was situated in the third quadrant of the square lattice and was anchored at the origin .",
    "its precise location could be specified by a spin configuration on the positive semi - infinite one - dimensional integer lattice @xmath4 .",
    "fluctuations of the location of the interface at a distance @xmath5 from the origin are then directly transcribed into fluctuations of the magnetization @xmath6 in the stationary state of the one - dimensional model .",
    "the dynamics of the semi - infinite 1d spin model are as follows : starting with some initial configuration ( containing a mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath3 spins ) we pick a site @xmath7 with rate 1 if @xmath8 , and with rate @xmath9 if @xmath10 , and exchange @xmath11 with the spin @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the first site to the right of @xmath7 such that @xmath14 .",
    "remarkably , the model inherits the unidirectional nature of information flow in the toom model and the stationary state for the first @xmath5 spins can be obtained exactly ( no finite size effects ) by restricting the dynamics to a system with l spins , with the provision that if site @xmath7 is in the last block of spins , i.e. , if @xmath15 , then the spin @xmath11 is flipped , i.e. , changed to @xmath16 ( with rate 1 or @xmath17 ) .",
    "the model can be classified into two cases , the unbiased case with @xmath18 , and the biased case with @xmath19 .",
    "quantities of interest in the model include the average of the magnetization @xmath20 and its variation @xmath21 as functions of the system size @xmath5 . by symmetry ,",
    "@xmath22 in the unbiased case , and a simple computation , using the well justified assumption that spins far from the origin are statistically independent , shows that in general @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "the fluctuations have not been calculated exactly .",
    "simulations reported in @xcite gave @xmath25 with @xmath26 in the unbiased case and @xmath27 for @xmath28 , but in fact approximate treatments discussed there suggested that the true exponents are @xmath29 in the unbiased case , possibly with logarithmic corrections , and @xmath30 in the biased case .",
    "two approximation methods were introduced in @xcite .",
    "the first , the _ collective variable approximation _ ( cva ) , gives @xmath31 in the unbiased case and @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 a computable constant ) in the biased case .",
    "the second approach was based on a description of the interface by a non - linear stochastic diffusion equation of the ew @xcite and kpz @xcite type .",
    "analysis of this equation predicts how fluctuations of a ( doubly ) infinite uniform interface will grow in time ; in the semi - infinite problem , the fixed boundary at the left of the system and the positive velocity of excitations convert this growth to a corresponding @xmath5-dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "this approach predicts @xmath35 in the biased case ( here @xmath36 is the usual kpz exponent ) . in the unbiased case",
    "the prediction depends on the growth of excitations in a modified kpz equation with a third order , but no second order , nonlinearity ; a subsequent renormalization group analysis of this problem ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) leads to the prediction @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation results of @xcite did not include sufficiently large systems to distinguish the logarithmic behavior in the unbiased case from behavior @xmath38 , with @xmath39 a power slightly higher than @xmath40 , or to verify the power @xmath36 in the biased case .",
    "simulations of @xcite and @xcite support the renormalization group conclusions for a uniform system but , since the passage from the uniform to the semi - infinite system is somewhat heuristic , provide only indirect guidance for the latter . in the present note",
    "we describe new simulations on our original model for @xmath41 both for @xmath42 and @xmath28 .",
    "we also did simulations on modified models and models with different bias values .",
    "our results on the unbiased case give support to the predictions of @xcite .",
    "our results for the biased case seem to suggest that the cva is a very good approximation .    for computational efficiency",
    ", we used a type of `` multi - spin coding '' , similar to the technique applied for simulating the repton model in @xcite .",
    "the computationally intensive part of the code is written in bit operations like and ( @xmath43 ) , exclusive or ( @xmath44 ) and not ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "this allows one to run 32 or 64 independent simulations in parallel by applying bit operations to four - byte or eight - byte integers of which each bit corresponds to an independent simulation .",
    "we introduce a coding variable @xmath46 . to implement the algorithm ,",
    "we first choose ( as described below ) a marker @xmath47 , whose nonzero bits select the simulations in which updating will take place , then pick a random site @xmath13 and flip the selected spins at this site : @xmath48 next we walk along the chain , starting at @xmath49 and incrementing @xmath50 by one at each step .",
    "in each simulation we flip the spin @xmath51 if it differs from @xmath52 and if so we set the corresponding bit in the marker to zero : @xmath53 we continue walking until either our marker @xmath47 equals @xmath54 or we have reached the end of the chain . to insure that simulations running in different bits do not become identical , we initialize @xmath47 as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a random bit - sequence with each bit taking the value 1 with probability @xmath40 , and then repeat with a different starting site @xmath13 and with @xmath57 .",
    "this generates a large degree of independence between simulations corresponding to different bits .    to obtain the mask @xmath47 we use the random number generator _",
    "@xcite , which has good randomness properties for all the bits ; for the site selection we use the random number generator _ ranmar _",
    "@xcite , which has a long sequence and good spectral properties .    in the absence of a bias ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the thermalization time @xmath58 required was determined to be @xmath59 spin exchanges .",
    "the autocorrelation time of the magnetization in the steady state is much smaller , growing as @xmath60 , as found also in @xcite , although the thermalization time suggests that some correlations must grow as @xmath61 .",
    "the presence of a bias increases the required thermalization time ; for @xmath28 , @xmath62 and for @xmath63 .",
    "for @xmath64 we took again @xmath62 as thermalization , although we could have taken a bit less .",
    "one run typically starts with a random spin configuration , which is evolved over time @xmath65 .",
    "the magnetization in each simulation ( corresponding to a bit ) is measured every @xmath5 moves ; for each interval of length @xmath58 a separate histogram of the magnetization m , including all bit simulations , is constructed .",
    "the first histogram is discarded ( thermalization ) and from the remaining @xmath66 histograms we obtain moments of the magnetization .",
    "reported statistical errors in these moments are one standard deviation errors based on the assumption that these @xmath66 histograms are statistically independent . note that even if simulations in different bits are correlated , we still obtain a reliable error estimation",
    "in the absence of bias ( @xmath18 ) we now have data for sizes @xmath67 , presented in table i. two analytic descriptions of the growth of fluctuations have been proposed : in @xcite it was suggested that : @xmath68 with @xmath69 ; on the other hand in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , a formula based on the dynamical renormalization calculation was proposed : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in this section",
    "we will argue that this data supports the conclusion of @xcite , although we disagree on the identification of the constant @xmath73 .",
    "clearly it is difficult to distinguish between the behavior ( [ power ] ) and ( [ log ] ) .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath74 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath5 throughout the range of our simulations and @xmath75 is monotonic increasing for @xmath76 , suggesting asymptotic behavior ( [ log ] ) for some intermediate value of @xmath77 , but in fact the same is true if @xmath34 is replaced by @xmath78 , the behavior found in @xcite .    as a qualitative criterion for comparison of fit",
    ", we ask for what minimal value @xmath79 of the system size various proposed forms ( all having two free parameters ) can provide a good fit over interval @xmath80 $ ] , rejecting a fit as bad if it fails the standard @xmath81 test at a 99% confidence level . the asymptotic form ( [ power ] ) , computed as a linear fit @xmath82 , yields @xmath83 , while the forms ( [ log ] ) , again as linear fits @xmath84 , yield @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath40 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "this analysis thus provides evidence to prefer ( [ log ] ) , which describes the data over a wider range of system sizes , although it does not conclusively rule out ( [ power ] ) .",
    "we now consider ( [ log ] ) and ask whether our data can determine the exponent @xmath77 .",
    "the difficulty is that the three parameters in ( [ log ] ) provide a great deal of freedom , allowing for good fits for a range of values of @xmath92 , if we vary the values of @xmath73 and @xmath33 .",
    "the test discussed above is indefinite , and in fact mildly favors a value of @xmath40 , as opposed to the renormalization group calculation of @xmath90 .",
    "we now turn to a different line of argument which does provide evidence for the latter value , and begin with a review of the second approximate approach of @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the application of the renormalization group depends on consideration of our dynamical model on the doubly infinite line , viewed as a height interface growth model .",
    "such interface growth models may be described by non - linear stochastic diffusion equations of the ew and kpz type ; for our model the symmetries in the problem lead to the equation @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a stochastic noise term .",
    "the term in ( [ kpz3 ] ) with coefficient @xmath95 is usually eliminated by a galilean transformation , but this is not possible in the semi - infinite system and in fact this term has important consequences , discussed below . if @xmath96 then ( [ kpz3 ] ) is the edward - wilkinson growth model , which leads to interface growth @xmath97 .",
    "the full equation ( [ kpz3 ] ) can be analyzed using dynamical renormalization techniques @xcite ; in this analysis the higher order terms are irrelevant and the cubic term is marginally irrelevant , giving @xmath98 the parameter @xmath95 is positive , so that fluctuations in @xmath99 travel to the right .",
    "we can compute the velocity @xmath100 of infinitesimal density perturbations in the ( bernoulli ) steady state , via @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the current at density @xmath103 , to find @xmath104 @xcite . to apply these observations to the original model on the half open system",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that excitations created at the closed end of the system grow according to ( [ time ] ) as they travel towards the open end at speed @xmath100 ; this leads to ( [ log ] ) with @xmath71 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "( see also @xcite , although there it is tacitly assumed that @xmath107 ) .    in order to understand the exact form of the logarithmic corrections and",
    "check the validity of the above prediction , we studied a class of modifications of the original model , with dynamics defined as follows : we choose a site at rate @xmath108 , then exchange the spin at that site with the @xmath109 spin of opposite sign to the right .",
    "the original model is obtained by taking @xmath110 .",
    "these models all share the symmetries of the original , so we expect that they will belong to the same universality class and hence have similar behavior of fluctuations ; thus the variance @xmath111 in these models should satisfy ( [ log ] ) with the same value of @xmath77 but with possibly different constants @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "we obtained data for models with @xmath114 ( see table i ) .",
    "again , we can fit ( [ log ] ) to the individual data sets for a range of values of @xmath77 if we choose appropriate @xmath115 and @xmath113 ; to proceed further , we would like some a priori argument determining how these values depend on @xmath50 .",
    "now we propose a heuristic argument which describes how the constant @xmath113 might vary with @xmath50 . on the one hand ,",
    "a computation in the steady state determines that the current in this model is proportional to @xmath50 and hence that the velocity @xmath116 of excitations satisfies @xmath117 . on the other hand , the model for parameter @xmath50",
    "can be thought of as a modification of the original model in which , during one time step , @xmath50 exchanges rather than one spin exchange take place .",
    "now these @xmath50 exchanges take place in correlated positions .",
    "these correlations are certainly significant on the microscopic scale ( e.g. , the distance between two successive moves would definitely be affected by these correlations ) , but as seen from the computation of the current and the velocity these correlations are apparently not important on the hydrodynamic scale .",
    "hence there should be some length scale below which the correlations are significant .",
    "we have two parameters in ( [ log ] ) which could be affected by these correlations , @xmath113 and @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 ( along with @xmath77 ) determines the behavior to leading order at large @xmath5 , and @xmath112 is significant only at higher orders .",
    "if we assume that the correlations are not important at least to the order determining @xmath113 , then for a computation of @xmath113 , the model for parameter @xmath50 would correspond to the original model with the time rescaled by a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath118 , and hence that @xmath119 .",
    "another way of saying this , which does not make any reference to the time dependent problem , is to write @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath121 as @xmath122 , we must have @xmath123 .",
    "now if the leading order term in @xmath124 is also independent of @xmath50 ( which seems not unreasonable ) then we would also have @xmath113 independent of @xmath50 and vice versa .",
    "to study the @xmath50-dependence of @xmath113 , we plot in figure 1 @xmath125 versus @xmath126 for @xmath127 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 ; according to equation ( [ log ] ) this curve is approaching a straight line with slope @xmath128 and offset @xmath129 . only for @xmath71 can a data collapse be obtained by vertically shifting the curves ( which corresponds to a change in @xmath130 ) , indicating that @xmath50-independence of @xmath113 holds only for @xmath71 .",
    "results of least - squares fit for all data on the interval @xmath131 $ ] , in the form @xmath132 , are given in table 2 ; the approximate constancy of @xmath133 verifies the conclusion .",
    "thus under the assumption made above , this provides independent justification of the conclusion @xmath71 .",
    "we also observe from table 2 that @xmath134 and hence @xmath112 depends strongly on @xmath50 for all @xmath77 .",
    "we interpret this as indicating that the correlations are important on the scale of @xmath73 and hence we can not use the above argument to determine the @xmath50 dependence of @xmath112 .",
    "to summarize , we now have numerical evidence for logarithmic corrections , and our data , when supplemented by a heuristic argument , supports the prediction ( [ log ] ) ( with @xmath71 ) obtained with the help of dynamical renormalization techniques @xcite .",
    "in the biased case we generated data for @xmath135 for @xmath28 . as compared to the data reported in @xcite , this provides much better evidence for the asymptotic form @xmath136 predicted by both the kpz and cva approximations .",
    "we note that for the biased model the differential equation for the height evolution is the usual kpz equation @xmath137 where now the the non - linear quadratic term is relevant and it changes the power of the growth of fluctuations in time from 1/2 to 2/3 .",
    "we now compare the simulation results more closely with those obtained analytically for the asymptotic case of the cva ( the continuum limit ) : @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath139 vanishes at @xmath140 and has a maximum at @xmath141 . as shown in figure 2",
    ", the values obtained from the cva seem to be strikingly close to the simulation values in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the data suggests that the constants of proportionality @xmath142 for the variance in the two cases are extremely close if not identical . to check whether the cva was close only for this particular value of @xmath17 , we studied two more values of bias @xmath143 .",
    "as shown in figure 2 for both the cases , we observed that the cva seemed to give values which are extremely close to the actual values .    in order to have a better estimate of the accuracy of the cva",
    ", we also studied the whole distribution of magnetization .",
    "the continuum limit cva gives for the distribution of the magnetization values the fourth power of an airy function @xcite , with a somewhat ad hoc cutoff suggested by the discrete cva ( the simulations and the cva both give a gaussian distribution for @xmath42 ) .",
    "this function has an asymmetry about the mean value . in figure 3",
    "we compare this cva limiting distribution with the distribution of magnetization determined from simulations , with all distributions normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the actual distribution shows the same characteristic features as the cva result ; moreover , looking at the distributions for different l values suggests a slow approach of the distribution towards the airy function with increasing size l. however , if we look at the leading measure of asymmetry in the distribution the normalized third moment @xmath144  then we observe ( see figure 3 inset ) that the actual values and that obtained from the cva are quite different .",
    "we also studied the values of average magnetization obtained for finite size systems .",
    "as noted in @xcite the exact asymptotic value and that obtained from the cva coincide and are given by @xmath145 , where @xmath24 .",
    "in figure 4 , we plot the approach of the average magnetization to the asymptotic value . both the approach for the cva and",
    "that for the actual data show very similar behavior .    at the end of this analysis ,",
    "we are left with the somewhat puzzling result , that though the cva does not reproduce , even qualitatively , the results for the unbiased case , it seems to be an extremely accurate description for the biased case .",
