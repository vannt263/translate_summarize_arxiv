    "the prevailing ` mode ' of star formation in the distant universe , namely merger - driven starbursts versus isolated star - forming gas - rich disks  with their h@xmath10 gas as traced by its carbon monoxide ( co ) line emission  is now a topic of intense interest after the discovery of numerous galaxies at high redshifts with gas fractions above 50% that seem to follow the latter mode ( e.g.  daddi et al .",
    "2010 ; tacconi et al .",
    "nevertheless , the indicators used in such studies , namely the near galactic value of the @xmath12 factor , and low - excitation low-_j _ co spectral line energy distributions ( sleds ) are strongly degenerate when it comes to the star formation mode ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2012 ) and thus can not be used to securely argue for a bi - modal distribution of star formation modes . moreover using ratios of single co line luminosities ( used as measures of total molecular gas mass ) to infrared luminosity ( used as star formation rate proxy ) as mode indicators",
    "is fraught with uncertainty because the value of the @xmath12 remains both highly uncertain and dependant on galaxy type , molecular gas surface density and kinematic state , as well as average star formation activity ( see narayanan et al .",
    "2011 for a recent exposition ) .    in the local universe the star formation ` mode ' seems to be very well ( i.e.uniquely ) indicated by the fraction of the total gas reservoir residing in the dense phase : @xmath13 , a fact that can be easily exploited in high redshift galaxy surveys .",
    "in this article , we explore practical means of determining the star formation mode of galaxies , using low-_j _ co or [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)and hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) line surveys as the most effective tool for determining @xmath0=@xmath14 as a function of redshift . selecting galaxies through @xmath0",
    "is independent of the various selection criteria used in traditional galaxy surveys , and is unaffected by degeneracies of co sleds in determining @xmath0 ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2012 ) .    for the purposes of this work we seek good proxies of the dense gas mass fraction and investigate their observational prospects in the distant universe , especially in survey mode , but will not delve into the details of how such proxies can be translated into actual @xmath0 values .",
    "multi-_j _ and multi - species molecular line observations are needed for this ( e.g. greve et al .",
    "2009 ) , which will soon become routine for the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "we note that the prize from actual estimates of @xmath0 values and direct measurements of turbulent line widths in the molecular gas of distant star - forming galaxies with sensitive imaging interferometers like alma ( see swinbank et al .",
    "2011 for an example for a gas - rich starburst at @xmath15 ) will be to properly investigate proposed universal turbulence - regulated star formation theory for galaxies ( krumholz & mckee  2005 ) .",
    "finally we outline some of the unique discovery possibilities that very deep low-_j _ co ( @xmath16 ) surveys with the square kilometer array ( ska ) can offer when it comes to gas - rich systems with very low @xmath0 values that can only be discovered with blind surveys .",
    "such galaxies will have negligible hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and co @xmath19 line emission , and would be extreme outliers of the schmidt ",
    "kennicutt relation ( kennicutt  1998 ) , unselected by current high - redshift galaxy surveys as these are based , directly or indirectly , on the star formation rate ( sfr , e.g.  optical / near - ir lines from hii regions , ( sub)mm dust thermal continuum , and cm non - thermal continuum ) .",
    "this population would be valuable for extending our understanding of the gas properties and early star formation histories of massive galaxies .",
    "where relevant , we assume a flat cosmological model , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 .",
    "paper i presented a model for the abundance of molecular and atomic line - emitting galaxies seen across cosmic time , using a ` minimal ' model for the cold molecular interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "we envision that future surveys will assemble large samples of high-_z _ systems with bright molecular line mission , be it in a totally blind sense , or by ( sub)mm / cm spectroscopic follow - up of a sfr ( most likely proxied by the submm continuum ) or stellar mass limited sample ( achievable with deep optical / near - infrared surveys ) .",
    "a survey of the star formation mode would be a powerful probe of galaxy evolution , since it would perform the dual task of measuring the evolution of the total gas fraction of star - forming galaxies , the nature of the star formation ( burst or secular ) , and a more accurate prediction of the rate of consumption of the cold gas reservoirs .",
    "a prominent bi - modality of the @xmath0 values in merger - driven versus isolated disk star formation is actually expected as a general characteristic of supersonic turbulence because of the much larger ( @xmath24530@xmath25 ) turbulent line widths observed in co line emission in mergers / ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) than in isolated spiral disks ( downes & solomon1998 ) .",
    "this difference is expected to be _ a general characteristic of merger versus isolated disk systems _",
    "( narayanan et al .  2011 ) .",
    "the resulting difference in the corresponding 1-dimensional average mach numbers @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 ) leads to much higher dense gas mass fractions in the ism of mergers than in isolated disks given that the probability distribution function of the molecular gas density in supersonic turbulence is well approximated by a log - normal distribution with a dispersion of @xmath28 ( padoan & nordlund 2002 ) .",
    "the very enhanced dense gas mass fractions molecular gas mass fraction expected to be in structures with overdensities @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the gas density ) is then given by    @xmath32.\\ ] ]    the typically large velocity dispersions of @xmath33@xmath24(30140)kms@xmath23 in the molecular gas disks of the merger systems found in ulirgs ( and recently even in a molecular gas disk fueling star formation in an spectacular starburst at @xmath34 , see swinbank et al .",
    "2011 ) , with corresponding large @xmath35 will dramatically extend the gas density probability distribution function towards high values where much of the molecular gas mass will lie , quite unlike the less turbulent molecular gas in isolated disks ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "thus for giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in typical spiral disks only @xmath243% of their mass is expected to be at overdensities @xmath36 ( 5@xmath2510@xmath37@xmath38 for a typical gmc with @xmath39@xmath38 ) while for the highly turbulent gas in mergers this is @xmath2445% , and can be even higher ( e.g. greve et al .",
    "2009 ) .      in the following we consider various combinations of molecular and atomic lines as proxies of @xmath0 .",
    "a summary from available line data for mostly local galaxies can be found in figure  2 where we plot normalized line ratios for a sample of observations of ( i ) quiescent star forming disks and dark clouds and ( ii ) galactic nuclei , mergers and starburst galaxies , compiled from the literature ( gao & solomon  2004 , israel et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 , 2003 , barvainis et al .",
    "1997 , white et al .",
    "1994 , petitpas & wilson  1998 ) .",
    "we define the normalized ratios as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to ( for example ) the line brightness luminosities of the dense and total gas tracers hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and",
    "co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)with @xmath43 representing the average over the entire sample .",
    "it is clear from figure  2 that carefully - picked line diagnostics can sensitively distinguish between ` disk ' and ` burst ' mode , with @xmath44 dividing the two classes .",
    "individual @xmath45 tracers ( e.g.  hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)line ratios ) can be even more sensitive than what the distribution in figure  2 indicates , with factors of @xmath2410 difference between ` disk ' and ` burst ' mode ( see  2.2.1 ) . moreover , the sample presented in figure  2 is dominated by local systems while high redshift observations present more of a challenge as global line measurements may represent wide spatial averages ( smearing out the line ratio for composite systems ) , but also because the observed frequencies of lines available in the local universe will be redshifted out of the current range of sensitive facilities for certain important cosmological spans of time .",
    "we now will now discuss several of these tracers in more detail , highlighting their relative merits with a view to identifying diagnostic tools that will be suitable for practical surveys of the star formation mode of galaxies over large spans of cosmic time .",
    "this is the cleanest @xmath0 indicator available , with local studies showing a clear bi - modality for the ism in merger - driven starbursts versus isolated disks with lower sfrs in the local universe ( gao & solomon  2004 ) , with hcn tracing the dense , star - forming gas mass , and low-_j _ co tracking the total gas reservoir . arguably this line combination is the most direct tracer of @xmath0 ; extensive observations of local galaxies show this line ratio to be an excellent way to discriminate between different modes , with high values of @xmath47@xmath48 found exclusively in compact , merger - driven , extreme starbursts while @xmath49@xmath50 for isolated spiral disks with extended star formation ( e.g.solomon et al .  1992 ; gao  & solomon  2004 ) .    observing hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)(@xmath51ghz ) and co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)(@xmath52ghz )",
    "has the disadvantage that , although this line combination will be accessible with alma for local systems ( important for an even more robust calibration in terms of @xmath0 ) , by @xmath53 co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)is redshifted out of the alma bands and remains inaccessible until @xmath54 in the cm bands ( and accessible with other cm - wave facilities ) .",
    "in addition , due to the broad telluric absorption feature at @xmath55ghz , there will be a broad hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)`desert ' in the @xmath56 interval , limiting the use of this tracer for intermediate redshift work .    due to the aforementioned shortcomings",
    ", this particular indicator will only be effective for probing very local galaxies rather than those at cosmologically significant redshifts of @xmath57 , and thus can not satisfactorily measure @xmath0 over the peak of the global star formation rate density in a well - sampled , tomographic manner .",
    "however , given the small range of both co and hcn @xmath58@xmath17 , the @xmath59 transition of these two molecules can also be used to the same effect .",
    "this allows alma to survey @xmath60 up to @xmath61 as the rest frequencies of co_j_(@xmath46@xmath3@xmath17)and hcn_j_(@xmath46@xmath3@xmath17)are at 230.538ghz and 177.264ghz respectively .",
    "hcn_j_(@xmath46@xmath3@xmath17)can be accessed by alma out to @xmath53 , and hcn_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)out to @xmath62 . given the order of magnitude differences expected for the @xmath60-type of ratios between mergers and isolated disks it is very likely that even hcn_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)and ratios such as hcn_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)/co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)or hcn_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)/co_j_(@xmath46@xmath3@xmath17)will remain practical proxies of @xmath63 out to @xmath64 using alma .",
    "moreover , given the tremendous sensitivity boost at ( sub)mm wavelengths that alma represents , the necessary calibration of such ` hybrid ' hcn / co ratios in terms of @xmath0 will be trivial for large numbers of star - forming galaxies in the local universe .      this is a potentially powerful tracer of @xmath0 , with  as mentioned above  the hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and hcn_j_(@xmath46@xmath3@xmath17)line luminosities proportional to the dense star - forming gas mass , and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)scaling with total molecular gas mass , but with many advantages over low-_j _ co lines ( see paper  i ) .",
    "the higher rest frequency of [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)(@xmath65ghz ) , compared to hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)means that the corresponding [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)observations would be conducted with alma bands 6 and lower .",
    "local data support the notion of the ratio of hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)lines as a @xmath0 proxy , with @xmath66}$]@xmath240.552.2 observed in ulirgs ( [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)data presented in papadopoulos  &  greve  2004 ; greve  et al.2009 , and hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)data from gao  &  solomon  2004 ) . in comparison , for disk - dominated quiescent galaxies , @xmath66}\\sim 0.06 - 0.10 $ ] , although it can rise up to @xmath240.5 for vigorously star - forming disks like that of ngc1068 ( using hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)data from gao & solomon [ 2004 ] and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)data from israel et al .  [ 2009 ] ) .",

    "the @xmath72 ratios are not proxies of @xmath0 but rather of the turbulent velocity fields of giant molecular clouds in star - forming galaxies .",
    "numerous studies have shown that @xmath73 in disks , with low values found in milky way type systems and larger ones in vigorously star - forming disks ( e.g.  casoli et al .",
    "1992 ; aalto et al .  1995 ; papadopoulos & seaquist  1999 ) .",
    "ratios @xmath74 are found _ exclusively _ in merger systems and are thought to be the result of the highly turbulent ism and the enhanced gas temperatures produced by the dissipation of their supersonic turbulence ( aalto et al .  1995 ; greve et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "the advantage of using isotopologue line ratios as proxies of merger versus isolated - disk star formation modes , even if such ratios are not proxies of @xmath0 , is obvious : the convenience yielded by their frequency proximity .",
    "wide bandwidth receivers allow the possibility of deep surveys with simultaneous co and @xmath68co line observations .",
    "objects with @xmath75 would be considered as harbouring merger - driven star formation , while all the rest would be in the disk mode .",
    "this method can safely be used up to @xmath76 , partly because of lack of local @xmath68co_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)or higher-_j _ line data ( the @xmath68co_j_(@xmath4@xmath3@xmath46)line lies precariously close to an atmospheric absorption feature ) but also because higher-_j _ co lines will progressively cease to be good tracers of the _ average _ velocity fields of molecular clouds and begin tracing their self - gravitating , dense regions ( ossenkopf  2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless recent measurements of a large @xmath77 in a distant ulirg - hosting qso ( henkel et al .",
    "2010 ) indicate that such a diagnostic may remain a good star formation mode indicator up to @xmath78 .",
    "finally we note that a competing explanation for the very high @xmath79 ratios observed in all ulirgs exists , attributing them to much higher @xmath80 $ ] abundances in such systems ( casoli et al .",
    "1992 ; henkel & mauersberger  1993 and references therein ) , possibly caused by a different stellar initial mass function in merger / starburst systems .",
    "if this is true it would make @xmath81 a less ` clean ' star formation mode indicator unless a strong link can be proven between such isotopic enhancements and merger - driven star - forming systems .",
    "the @xmath82}$ ] ratio has the key advantage that the lines used have similar rest frequencies , ( @xmath83ghz , and thus similar beams for a given aperture ) , while both remain accessible to alma across a large span of cosmic time .",
    "it is assumed that co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)traces mostly dense star - forming gas , an expectation borne out both by observations ( e.g.petitpas & wilson 1988 ; nieten et al .",
    "1999 ; papadopoulos et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as models of emergent co line emission from turbulent molecular clouds ( ossenkopf  2002 ) .",
    "finally , both lines benefit from a positive _ k_-correction with respect to lower-_j _ lines making them suitable for ( h@xmath10 mass)-sensitive high-_z _ work .",
    "unfortunately , their relatively high frequencies and the lack of multi - beam receivers at such frequencies has prevented the assembly of a large body of co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line data in the extragalactic domain . nevertheless , enough data is assembled to examine if a significant bi - modality of @xmath82}$ ] indeed exists for starburst environments dominated by large dense gas reservoirs ( typical of merger - driven systems ) versus low - sfr environments in disks . in this comparison",
    "we also consider co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)data obtained for galactic nuclei ( e.g.  ngc  253 ) including that of the galactic center as representative of the _ average _ molecular ism properties of the merger - driven starbursts in ulirgs ( the high turbulence yielding also very high @xmath84 values in galactic centers ) .",

    "these include the galactic center , the nuclei of various nearby galaxies ( ngc 253 , maffei2 , m83 ) , a distant strongly - lensed qso ( the cloverleaf at @xmath86 ) and a local ulirg / qso ( mrk231 ) . for disk - dominated star - forming environments , the available literature data yield @xmath87}\\rangle\\sim0.45$]@xmath88 with the lowest value ( @xmath240.43 ) found for the outer galaxy and a quiescent cloud in m31 ( @xmath890.45 ) .",
    "somewhat higher values are obtained for the inner galaxy ( @xmath240.83 ) and star - forming spirals such as ngc4826 and ngc3079 ( @xmath241.3 , and see figure  2 ) .",
    "thus it is seems that the @xmath90}$ ] ratio _ can _ be a practical star formation mode indicator in the alma regime , with differences up to factors of @xmath2410 between mergers and disk - dominated systems .",
    "we note however that the intense cosmic ray fluxes expected in starburst environments can significantly boost the [ ci / h@xmath10 ] abundance ratio ( e.g.papadopoulos et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) , reducing the @xmath91}$ ] ratio in extreme starbursts .",
    "this may be happening in the inner 500pc of m82 where a rather low @xmath91}=1.5 $ ] is measured ( white et al .",
    "chemical models of [ ci / h@xmath10 ] as a function of average cosmic ray energy densities ( @xmath92sfr density ) are necessary to account for such effects as well as reducing the [ ci / h@xmath10 ] abundance uncertainties ( also needed for @xmath93(h@xmath10 ) estimates when using the the [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line luminosity ) .",
    "we expect that even crude models of a sfr - dependant ( i.e.  cosmic ray - dependant ) [ ci / h@xmath10 ] average abundance will yield @xmath91}$](cosmic ray@xmath94galactic ) ratios ( i.e.  referenced to a common galactic cosmic ray energy density ) that will be even more sensitive to @xmath0 ( and thus the star formation mode ) by much reducing the little overlap that exists for this currently cosmic ray - uncorrected star formation mode proxy ( and @xmath66}$ ] ) in figure  2 .      in light of the distinct advantages that this diagnostic offers for high-_z _ studies , in figure  3 we plot the fluxes of the [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)and co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)lines for a @xmath95 galaxy at @xmath8 undergoing a burst ( @xmath96 ) and disk - mode star formation ( @xmath97 )",
    ". to calculate the line fluxes , we use our minimalist ism model presented in paper i , assuming the ` supervirial ' and ` virial ' versions of the model for the burst and disk mode respectively ( see  3 of paper i for further details ) .",
    "the [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line flux is estimated from the total gas mass following equation 11 of papadopoulos , thi & viti  ( 2004 ) , adopting an excitation value of @xmath98 ( where @xmath99}$ ] is the ratio of the column density of gas in level @xmath5 to the ground state , appropriate for the lower temperature and excitation conditions when averaged over a global gas reservoir .",
    "the line ratios predicted from our model are @xmath100 for @xmath97 and @xmath101 for @xmath96 ; in agreement with the normalized values presented in figure  2 .",
    "we compare the predicted line fluxes to the 5@xmath102 sensitivity ( for channels of 300kms@xmath23 ) of full - power alma ( assumed to be 50 antennas ) in integrations of 1 , 10 and 24hours .",
    "this highlights the suitability of this line combination as a tool for surveys of the star formation mode , with both co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)lines detectable in realistic times for relatively normal galaxies over the full span of cosmological time pertinent to galaxy evolution in both disk and burst modes .",
    "the similarity of the line frequencies are key , because they provide nearly spatially matched beams ( for a given dish , and in the case of interferometers , array configurations ) , and this can be critical in mitigating the effect of any structural bias in the interpretation of such line ratios due to the ` mixing ' of line emission from systems with different star formation modes that may exist in relative close proximity in merger configurations ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "moreover , in the cases of well - resolved individual systems the @xmath103 ratio can give a quick approximate ` reading ' of the @xmath104 gas surface density ratio as a function of position within the galaxy .",
    "this level of detail , while certainly of interest to other types of studies concerning , for example , the detailed gas dynamics and its inward transport in galactic disks , will still be valuable for uncovering ` milder ' merger systems where the original disk is not destroyed but its @xmath105 is nevertheless enhanced by minor merger events .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of deep blind molecular line surveys is their potential to discover gas - rich systems with very low levels of star formation ; i.e.  very low @xmath0 .",
    "this could be a new class of objects that may be currently omitted by even the deepest galaxy surveys as these depend always on the sfr either directly ( e.g.  optical / near - infrared lines from hii regions ) or indirectly ( non - thermal cm continuum , ( sub)mm dust continuum ) .",
    "the ska and its pathfinders can search for the hi phase of such systems while deep low-_j _ co and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line observations ( the latter with alma ) can reveal their molecular gas reservoir .",
    "of course the existence of the latter and its detectability via co and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)lines assumes some significant metal enrichment of its ism ( so h@xmath10 can form within reasonable time and co , [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)can be there to trace it ) and thus some initial star formation episode .",
    "this need not contradict very low sfrs in the subsequent evolution of such systems , as a combination of structural properties ( e.g.  large thin disks ) , star formation feedback , and very different average ism properties ( very low density molecular clouds with little molecular cooling ) may act to suppress sfrs over long periods of time .",
    "this has already been shown possible , albeit for short periods of time , for gas - rich and metal - poor disks with otherwise typical structural characteristics ( papadopoulos & pelupessy  2010 ) . during such periods",
    "these systems can undergo ` bursts ' of very inefficient sf ( as well as ` bursts ' of very efficient star formation ) that would place these systems as extreme deviants of the local schmidt - kennicutt ( s  k ) sfr / gas density scalings . regardless whether h@xmath10-rich galaxies with ultra - low sfrs are simply a ) short ( s  k)-deviant periods over much longer lifetimes of otherwise normal sf galaxies ( e.g.  ` pre - starbursts ' : gas - rich systems seen just prior to a burst of intense star formation ) , or b ) a completely new class of objects widely spread across cosmic epoch , deep low-_j _ co and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)blind line surveys are the way to find them .",
    "the [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line is particularly promising because of its large positive _ k_-correction ( with respect to low-_j _ co lines ) yet easy excitation , and its potential to trace the metal - poor ism with much of co dissociated by far - uv radiation ( or simply never formed in sufficient abundances ) leaving [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)and [ cii]as the dominant form of carbon . on the other hand , the ska will have the sensitivity and field of view making it favourable for searching for low-_j _ co at high - redshift compared to [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)in the alma bands .",
    "we note that the [ cii]line can trace such ism much more sensitively than [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)but unfortunately it becomes accessible to sensitive alma bands only for @xmath106 ( figure  2 in paper  i ) , and it can not be easily   translated   to total molecular gas mass like the latter .    here",
    "we consider a nave model , where it is assumed that every star - forming galaxy goes through a brief pre - starburst phase prior to the onset of star formation , such that the abundance of sources is simply proportional to number of galaxies contributing to the infrared luminosity density used in our abundance model ( paper  i ) : @xmath107 .",
    "we assume a pre - starburst ` duty cycle ' of @xmath108% and ` low ' mode of @xmath109 , such that the majority of gas is in the cold , quiescent phase .",
    "clearly the ska with its sensitivity , wide field of view and access to low-_j _ co lines at @xmath110 is the most suitable facility for a search of pre - starburst galaxies .",

    "indeed it is only for the dense gas phase that the latter have the intended meaning as the duration of the observed star formation event , though in the literature the longer timescales of @xmath117 are often used , a rather poor choice as not all of the molecular gas is relevant to star formation , only the dense phase .",
    "in this work we use our minimal molecular and atomic line emission model presented in paperi ( where it was used to assess the practicality of blind galaxy surveys using ism molecular and atomic lines ) , to discuss practical surveys of the star formation ` mode ' of galaxies , i.e.  isolated disks versus mergers , using the mass fraction @xmath0 of the dense star - forming gas phase versus the total molecular gas mass residing in star - forming galaxies .",
    "we argue that theoretical expectations as well as local molecular line studies point to @xmath0 as a very sensitive , extinction - free , measure of the star formation mode , independent of any galaxy morphological criteria .",
    "moreover @xmath0 does not suffer from well - known degeneracies of low-_j _ co lines and the values of the so - called @xmath118 factor which make them poor star formation mode indicators of galaxies . among the various proxies of @xmath0 we discuss , including hcn / co ( @xmath71 ) , hcn_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18)/[ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) , ratios , we find that the co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)/co_j_(@xmath17@xmath3@xmath18 )  ratio currently offers the most immediately practical path to star formation mode surveys using alma , with the similarity of the lines frequencies offering observing efficiency , and the nearly matched beam size for a given telescope ( the most suitable being alma for galaxy evolution studies ) being an important advantage .",
    "sensitive @xmath70co/@xmath68co for @xmath71 line ratio surveys are another promising route maintaining the latter advantage , though such ratios are not direct proxies of @xmath0 rather than of the average turbulence levels in the ism environments of disks ( with low @xmath70co/@xmath68co ratios ) and mergers ( with high @xmath70co/@xmath68co ratios ) .",
    "we note that for uniquely parametrizing the @xmath0 in gas - rich star - forming systems in the distant universe , the specific high - density gas tracers used are not important .",
    "as sensitivities dramatically improve in the era of alma , other tracers will become available ; for example , cs lines will also become suitable , with the same merger - versus - disk bi - modality expected for the corresponding @xmath119 and @xmath120}$ ] ratios .",
    "of course before any foray into the high redshift universe any proxy of @xmath0 must be calibrated locally with large samples of star - forming galaxies , a task easily performed with the vastly improved sensitivities of alma for all typical dense ( and total ) molecular gas mass tracers .",
    "finally we comment on the capabilities of upcoming observing facilities in searching for h@xmath10-rich galaxies with ultra - low star formation rates in the distant universe .",
    "these would be extreme outliers of the local ( sfr density)-(gas mass ) schmidt - kennicutt ( s  k ) relations , and deep low-_j _ co and [ ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7)line observations with the ska and alma are the only way to discover them .",
    "the [ cii]line can also be used to trace such systems very effectively with alma , especially if they are metal - poor , but only at very high redshifts where the line is redshifted into the sensitive alma bands ( paper  i ) , while its luminosity can not be straightforwardly assigned to total molecular gas mass .",
    "future cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution that include their molecular gas phase can inform on such possibilities , but it must be emphasized that such a putative population of ( s  k ) relation outlier gas - rich galaxies with ultra - low sfrs represents pure discovery space for deep molecular and atomic ism line surveys using alma , ska and its precursors , and thus should certainly be undertaken",

    "<S> we make use of our ` minimal ' cold interstellar medium ( ism ) emission line model that predicts the molecular and atomic line emission per unit dense , star - forming gas mass ( geach & papadopoulos  2012 ; paper  i ) to examine the utility of key line ratios in surveys of the so - called star formation ` mode ' as traced by @xmath0=@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that @xmath0 and its proxies provide very sensitive , extinction - free discriminators of rapid starburst / merger - driven versus secular quiescent / disk - like stellar mass assembly , with the most promising diagnostic to be applied in the near - future being co_j_(@xmath2@xmath3@xmath4)/[ci](@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) . </S>",

    "<S> in addition to their diagnostic power , another advantage of this combination is the similar observed frequencies ( @xmath9ghz ) of the lines , resulting in nearly spatially  matched beams for a fixed aperture , thus mitigating the effects of resolution / morphology bias in the interpretation of galaxy - averaged line ratios . </S>",

    "<S> . these could be the progenitors of starburst galaxies seen prior to the onset of star formation ; such galaxies could be a class of extreme outliers from local ( gas surface density)(star formation rate ) scaling laws , which would exclude them from current star formation or stellar mass selected samples . </S>",
