    ", it is expected that the novel properties recorded here by explicit calculations following directly from field theory , which is based on the principle of relativity and quantum theory , will lead to new experiments on polarization correlations monitoring speed in the light of bell s theorem .",

    "dynamical _ calculations in testing bell - like inequalities is critically important .",
    "an intriguing and very recent reference @xcite , which appeared after the submission of our paper for publication , discusses the role of relativity in quantum information , in general , and traces the historical development of its role , and most importantly , in the light of our present investigations , emphasizes the need of quantum field theory as necessary for a consistent description of interactions .",
    "most earlier analyses dealing with relativistic aspects , relevant to information theory and bell - like tests are kinematical of nature or deal with basic general properties of local operators associated with bounded regions of spacetime setting limits on measurements and localizability of quantum systems .",
    "these probabilities are well documented in some of the recent monographs @xcite@xcite on the subject .",
    "notable important other recent references on such general aspects which are , however , non - dynamical of nature are @xcite@xcite , and a paper by czachor @xcite indicating how a possible decrease in violation of bell s inequalities may occur . in the present work , we are interested in dynamical aspects and related uniquely determined probabilities ( intensities ) of correlations based on qed , as a fully relativistic quantum field theory ( i.e. , encompassing quantum theory and relativity ) that meet the verdict of experiments .",
    "qed is a non - speculative theory and as feynman @xcite puts it , it is the most precise theory we have in fundamental physics .",
    "the closest investigation to our own is that of ref.@xcite , a reference we encountered after the submission of our paper for publication , which considers spin - spin interactions , in a qed setting , for non - relativistic electrons and , unfortunately , does not compute their polarizations correlations which are much relevant experimentally . in the present paper , exact fully relativistic qed , computations , to the leading order , of polarizations _ correlations _ are explicitly carried out for initially polarized and unpolarized particles .",
    "the importance of also considering unpolarized spin stems from the fact that we discover the existence of non - trivial correlations , in the outcome of the processes , even for such mixed states ( since one averages over spin ) and not only for pure states arising from polarized spins , leading , in particular , in both cases to speed dependent probabilities .",
