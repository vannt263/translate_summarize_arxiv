    "the quantities @xmath20 and  @xmath21 , are asymptotically exact indicators of the errors @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the navier - stokes problem  ( [ onetwo])([ic ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the key observation in the present paper is that ( @xmath24 ) is also the mfe approximation to the solution @xmath25 of the stokes problem ( [ eq : stokes ] ) .",
    "consequently , any available procedure to a posteriori estimate the errors in a stokes problem can be used to estimate the errors @xmath26 and  @xmath21 which , as mentioned above , coincide asymptotically with the errors  @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the evolutionary ns equations .",
    "many references address the question of estimating the error in a stokes problem , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . in this paper",
    "we prove that any efficient or asymptotically exact estimator of the error in the mfe approximation @xmath27 to the solution of the _ steady _ stokes problem ( [ eq : stokes ] ) is also an efficient or asymptotically exact estimator , respectively , of the error in the mfe approximation @xmath27 to the solution of  the _ evolutionary _ navier - stokes equations ( [ onetwo])([ic ] ) .    for the analysis in the present paper we do not assume to have more than second - order spatial derivatives bounded in @xmath28 up to initial time @xmath29 , since demanding further regularity requires the data to satisfy nonlocal compatibility conditions unlikely to be fulfilled in practical situations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the errors @xmath30 and @xmath31 follows closely @xcite where mfe approximations to the stokes problem ( [ eq : stokes ] ) ( the so - called postprocessed approximations ) are considered with the aim of getting improved approximations to the solution of ( [ onetwo])([ic ] ) at any fixed time @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "we will also refer to ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) as postprocessed approximations although they are of course not computable in practice and they are only considered for the analysis of a posteriori error estimators .",
    "the postprocessed approximations to the navier - stokes equations were first developed for spectral methods in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also developed for mfe methods for the navier - stokes equations in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in the present paper we also analyze the use of the computable postprocessed approximations of  @xcite for a posteriori error estimation .",
    "the use of this kind of postprocessing technique to get a posteriori error estimations has been studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for nonlinear parabolic equations excluding the navier - stokes equations .",
    "we refer also to @xcite where the so - called stokes reconstruction is used to a posteriori estimate the errors of the semi - discrete in space approximations to a linear time - dependent stokes problem .",
    "we remark that the stokes reconstruction of @xcite is exactly the postprocessing approximation ( @xmath33 ) in the particular case of a linear model .    in the second part of the paper we consider a posteriori error estimations for the fully discrete mfe approximations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 for @xmath37 ) obtained by integrating in time with either the backward euler method or the two - step backward differentiation formula ( bdf ) . for this purpose",
    ", we define a stokes problem similar to ( [ eq : stokes ] ) but with the right - hand - side depending now on the fully discrete mfe approximation  @xmath38 ( problem  ( [ posth0n])([posth1n ] ) in section  [ sec:4 ] below ) . we will call time - discrete postprocessed approximation to the solution @xmath39 of this new stokes problem . as before , @xmath40 is not computable in practice and it is only considered for the analysis of a posteriori error estimation .",
    "observe that in the fully discrete case ( which is the case in actual computations ) the task of estimating the the error  @xmath41 of the mfe approximation becomes more difficult due to the presence of time discretization errors @xmath42 , which are added to the spatial discretization errors @xmath43 .",
    "however we show in section  [ sec:4 ] that if temporal and spatial errors are not very different in size , the quantity @xmath44 correctly esimates the spatial error because the leading terms of the temporal errors in @xmath45 and  @xmath38 get canceled out when subtracting @xmath44 , leaving only the spatial component of the error .",
    "this is a very convenient property that allows to use independent procedures for the tasks of estimating the errors of the spatial and temporal discretizations .",
    "we remark that the temporal error can be routinely controlled by resorting to well - known ordinary differential equations techniques .",
    "analogous results were obtained in @xcite for fully discrete finite element approximations to evolutionary convection - reaction - diffusion equations using the backward euler method .    as in the semidiscrete case , a key point in our results is again the fact that the fully discrete mfe approximation @xmath46 to the navier - stokes problem  ( [ onetwo])([ic ] ) is also the mfe approximation to the solution  @xmath47 of the stokes problem  ( [ posth0n])([posth1n ] ) . as a consequence , we can use again any available error estimator for the stokes problem to estimate the spatial error of the fully discrete mfe approximations @xmath46 to the navier - stokes problem  ( [ onetwo])([ic ] ) .",
    "computable mixed finite element approximations to  @xmath47 , the so - called fully discrete postprocessed approximations , were studied and analyzed in @xcite where we proved that the fully discrete postprocessed approximations maintain the increased spatial accuracy of the semi - discrete approximations . the analysis in the second part of the present paper borrows in part from  @xmath48 .",
    "also , we propose a computable error estimator based on the fully discrete postprocessed approximation of @xcite and show that it also has the excellent property of separating spatial and temporal errors .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . in section 2",

    "we deduce again from the values of the efficiency indexes that the a posteriori error estimates are very accurate , all the values are remarkably close to @xmath543 , which is the optimal value for the efficiency index .",
    "more precisely , we can observe that the values of the efficiency index in the @xmath11 norm for the velocity in this experiment belong to the interval @xmath544 $ ] .",
    "the values in the @xmath12 norm for the velocity lie on the interval @xmath545 $ ] and , finally , the values for the pressure are in the interval @xmath546 $ ] .    to conclude , we show a numerical experiment to check the behavior of the estimators in the fully discrete case .",

    "we use the mini - element with always the same value of @xmath548 .",
    "we use solid lines for the errors in the galerkin method and dashed lines for the estimations , as before .",
    "the @xmath11 norm errors are marked with asterisks while the @xmath12 norm errors are marked with circles .",
    "we estimate the errors using the postprocessed method computed with the same mini - element over a refined mesh of size @xmath551 . we observe that the galerkin errors decrease as @xmath485 decreases until a value that corresponds to the spatial error of the approximation . on the contrary ,",
    "the error estimations lie on an almost horizontal line , both for the velocity in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 norms and for the pressure .",
    "this means , as we stated in section 4.2 , that the error estimations we propose are a measure of the spatial errors , even when the errors in the galerkin method are polluted by errors coming from the temporal discretization . in this experiment",
    "the error estimations are very accurate for the spatial errors of the velocity in the @xmath12 norm and for the errors in the pressure .",
    "as commented above , the fact that postprocessing linear elements does not increase the convergence rate in the @xmath11 norm is reflected in the precision of the error estimations in the @xmath11 norm .",
    "on the right of figure  [ ulti ] we have represented the errors obtained when we integrate in time with the two - step bdf and fixed time step .",
    "the only remarkable difference is that , as we expected from the second order rate of convergence of the method in time , the temporal errors are smaller for the same values of the fixed time step @xmath485 .",
