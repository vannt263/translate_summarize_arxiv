    "glitches are sudden increases in rotation rates of pulsars , with @xmath0 , usually accompanied by jumps in the spin - down rate , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these changes tend to relax fully or partially on long timescales ( days to years ) , attributed to superfluid components of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic signals of pulsars do not change at glitches , indicating that there is no change in the external torque , so that glitches reflect angular momentum exchange between the observed crust and interior components of the neutron star ( see @xcite for a notable exception ) .",
    "the energy source of large glitches is rotational kinetic energy , which is the minimal free energy source available for the large and frequent exchanges of angular momentum .",
    "if additional free energy sources like elastic or magnetic energy were involved , the accompanying energy dissipation would exceed the observational bounds on glitch associated thermal radiation @xcite .",
    "starquake models can account for the smaller glitches typified by the crab pulsar .",
    "starquakes also act as triggers for the large glitches @xcite .",
    "a superfluid with quantized vortices which can be pinned will explain the exchange of angular momentum discontinuously as seen in the glitches @xcite , if large numbers of vortices unpin in an avalanche which can be self - organized @xcite , or triggered by a starquake .",
    "the vortex pinning and creep model @xcite explains glitches and postglitch response in terms of moments of inertia and relaxation times of the neutron superfluid in the neutron star crust s crystal lattice , where vortex lines can pin to nuclei .",
    "pinning leads to a lag @xmath2 between superfluid and crustal angular velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as vortex lines pin and unpin continually by thermal activation ,",
    "the lag @xmath5 drives an average vortex current radially outward from the rotation axis .",
    "this `` vortex creep '' allows the superfluid to spin down .",
    "the system evolves towards a steady state at which superfluid and the crust spin down at the same rate , @xmath6 , achieved at the steady state lag @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the continual spindown by vortex creep , if @xmath5 reaches a critical value @xmath8 beyond which pinning forces can no longer sustain the lag , a sudden discharge of the pinned vortices occurs .",
    "the resulting angular momentum transfer to the crust is observed as a glitch .",
    "the superfluid rotation rate decreases by @xmath9 and the crust rotation rate increases by @xmath10 , so that the lag decreases by @xmath11 at the glitch .",
    "this glitch induced change in @xmath5 offsets the creep , leading to very slow relaxation of the spindown rate by creep as thermal activation has a nonlinear dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "there is also a linear regime of creep leading to prompt exponential relaxation from some parts of the superfluid .",
    "the superfluid core of the star is already coupled to the crust tightly @xcite , on timescales short compared to the glitch rise time , which is less than 40 seconds for the vela pulsar @xcite . when the interaction between vortex lines and flux lines is included",
    "the crust - core coupling timescale becomes even shorter @xcite .",
    "the core superfluid is thus effectively included in the observed spindown of the outer ( normal matter ) crust and magnetosphere .",
    "the effective crust moment of inertia @xmath12 includes the core superfluid , so that @xmath13 , the total moment of inertia of the star .",
    "the jump and relaxation in the observed spindown rate of the crust indicates that the moment of inertia fraction in crustal superfluid participating in the glitch and postglitch relaxation is @xmath14 .",
    "the observed @xmath15 is consistent with the crustal superfluid moment of inertia fraction for neutron stars .",
    "this was proposed as a potential constraint for the equation of state ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "superfluid neutrons in the inner crust are in bloch states of the crust lattice .",
    "their effective mass @xmath16 is larger than the bare neutron mass @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this `` entrainment '' leaves only a fraction of the neutron superfluid to be effectively free to store and exchange angular momentum with the lattice @xcite .",
    "the fractional change in the observed spindown rate must be multiplied by the enhancement factor @xmath18 .",
    "the total moment of inertia in pinned superfluid sustaining vortex creep , @xmath19 , must be large enough , such that @xmath20 .",
    "the required moment of inertia in components of the star with pinning / creep then exceeds the moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid , @xmath21 , for reasonable neutron star equations of state @xcite .",
    "this suggests the involvement of the core superfluid in glitches and postglitch relaxation .    in the core",
    ", protons are expected to form a type ii superconductor with a dense array of flux lines @xcite .",
    "if present at all , type i superconductivity exists near the star s center , at @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "vortices can pin to flux lines by minimization of condensation and magnetic energies when vortex and flux line cores overlap @xcite .",
    "arguments for type i superconductivity based on putative precession @xcite are invalidated by the possibility of vortex creep ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the work of @xcite based on vela glitches , concluding for either weak flux - vortex pinning or type i superconductivity also does not take creep into account .",
    "type ii superconductivity with flux - vortex pinning and creep will accommodate the observed glitch and postglitch behavior .",
    "the bulk of the core proton superconductor - neutron superfluid region is likely to carry a uniform or poloidal array of flux lines .",
    "the associated moment of inertia fraction is too large , beyond the requirement of the entrainment effect .",
    "furthermore , a uniform or poloidal arrangement of the flux lines offers easy directions for vortex line motion without pinning or creep .",
    "this will make the effect of pinning and creep in the core dependent on the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes , making the moment of inertia fractions involved highly variable among different pulsars .",
    "a toroidal arrangement of flux lines , by contrast , provides a topologically unavoidable site for pinning and creep , and can have conditions similar to those of pinning against nuclei in the crustal lattice @xcite .",
    "we discuss the toroidal arrangement of flux lines in neutron stars as a site of vortex pinning and creep and its implications for pulsar glitches .",

    "is found to have a field strength of 10@xmath37 g corresponding to a surface magnetic field of @xmath38 g , typical for radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "simulations of upper main sequence stars @xcite and neutron stars with superconducting cores @xcite have common features .",
    "the toroidal field component is confined within closed field lines of the poloidal field .",
    "the poloidal field strength is maximum at the stellar center , while toroidal field attains its largest value in the outer regions , at @xmath39 .",
    "the toroidal field is confined within the neutron star crust for poloidal fields @xmath40 g @xcite ; but electron differential rotation in the crust will wind the poloidal field to generate strong toroidal flux @xcite , which is not likely to remain confined to the crust , and will extend into the core . for a stable configuration , the ratio of the toroidal and total magnetic field energies , @xmath41 can not be less than about 10 percent @xcite . in a model with superconducting core and",
    "proton fluid crust , this energy ratio is found to be as large as 90 percent when crustal toroidal fields are included @xcite .",
    "thus , simulations indicate a strong toroidal magnetic field of 10@xmath37 g @xcite , which will be carried by the flux lines . the toroidal field is maximum at @xmath42 , confined within an equatorial belt of radial extension @xmath43 @xcite . plausible neutron star models with relatively hard equations of state , have radii @xmath44 km , insensitive to the mass in the @xmath45 range . the density in the outer core is approximately uniform , @xmath46 g/ @xmath35 .",

    "depending on the radial extent of the toroidal field , the moment of inertia of the associated region can be comparable to and even larger than that of the inner crust superfluid .    , effected by vortices creeping against the toroidal flux . for simplicity",

    "the observed spindown rate @xmath48 typically displays several distinct postglitch relaxation terms with different moments of inertia and relaxation modes , including exponentially decaying transients and permanent changes in rotation and spindown rates . depending on the pinning energy @xmath49 and the interior temperature @xmath50 , vortex creep can operate in linear or nonlinear regimes @xcite . in the linear regime ,",

    "vortices unpinned at a glitch move through some nonlinear creep regions .",
    "these parts of the superfluid are deeply affected by the resulting sudden decrease in the superfluid rotation rate with @xmath62 .",
    "creep temporarily stops , decoupling these regions from angular momentum exchange with the crust , so that the external torque now acts on less moment of inertia .",

    ", can be integrated using eq ( [ ncreep ] ) .",
    "if the density of unpinned and repinned vortices is taken to be uniform throughout some superfluid regions of total moment of inertia @xmath68 , representing a mean field approach , then the integrated contribution to @xmath69 is characterized by a constant second derivative @xmath70 with which @xmath71 recovers its preglitch value after a waiting time @xmath72 corresponding to the maximum initial postglitch offset @xmath73 in these unpinning - repinning regions @xcite .",

    "this behavior prevails in the interglitch timing of the vela pulsar , and its healing signals the return to preglitch conditions , providing an estimate of the time of occurrence for the next glitch . such constant @xmath70 is common in older pulsars @xcite , and scales with the parameters of the vortex creep model @xcite .",
    "part of the glitch in @xmath4 , associated with moment of inertia @xmath74 , never relaxes back .",
    "this corresponds to vortex free regions @xmath75 interspersed with the unpinning - repinning creep regions @xmath76 .",
    "the vortex free regions @xmath75 are analogous to capacitors in a circuit : they do not support continuous vortex currents and do not contribute to the spindown , transferring angular momentum only at glitches when the unpinned vortices pass through .",

    "taking the range of the pinning force as @xmath92 and the average length between junctions as the spacing between flux lines , @xmath93 , the maximum lag @xmath8 that can be sustained by pinning forces is given by the magnus equation @xmath94 .",
    "the temperature at the crust - core boundary can be estimated for cooling via the modified urca process @xcite , or by relating the inner crust temperature to surface temperature measurements @xcite .",
    "both methods give interior temperatures of @xmath95 k. with these ranges of @xmath49 and @xmath96 , vortex creep will be in the nonlinear regime . the nonlinear creep relaxation time does not have the uncertainties of the @xmath97 estimate when divided by @xmath8 , giving , scaling with vela pulsar parameters , @xmath98 with @xmath99 g/@xmath35 and @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 days .",

    "this response of the nonlinear creep against toroidal flux lines is of the same form as the linear creep response of inner crust superfluid associated with postglitch exponential relaxation , eq.([lcreep ] ) , but with the nonlinear relaxation time and offset time given by eqs.([tau ] ) and ( [ offset ] ) .",
    "the entrainment effect for the crustal superfluid requires more moment of inertia in extra - crustal superfluid regions with pinning and creep in order to account for the observed glitch related changes in the spindown rates of pulsars .",
    "the toroidal configuration of flux lines in the outer core can provide the site for this .",
    "creep response in this region provides an exponentially relaxing contribution to the glitch in the spindown rate .",

    "this range accounts for a density range @xmath121 g/@xmath35 in the inner crust @xcite . it should be noted that calculations of the enhancement factor assume a bcc lattice that may not be valid @xcite ; uncertainties about defects and impurities as well as `` pasta '' structures may also lead to smaller enhancement factors @xcite .",

    "the response of the toroidal field region can account for these as well : in regions without glitch associated vortex motion the response would still be exponential relaxation , and the toroidal flux line region would contribute a similar response , providing the extra moment of inertia . in older pulsars ,",
    "the linear creep regions of the crustal superfluid progressively become nonlinear creep regions , and relaxation times calculated by eq.([tau ] ) become longer . in this case glitches",

    "we have given a proof of principle about the role of vortex pinning and creep response from the toroidal flux region in the outer core of the neutron star .",
    "the superfluid controlled by pinning and creep in this region can complement the crust superfluid to accommodate the moment of inertia requirements of entrainment .",
    "the vortex creep relaxation times are consistent with analysis of postglitch response in the vela glitches and scaling of the model to other pulsars .",
