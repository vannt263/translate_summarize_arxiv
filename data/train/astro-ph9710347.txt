    "peculiarly enough , the first binary pulsar to be discovered , psr   b1913 + 16 ( hulse & taylor 1975 ) , turned out to contain two neutron stars one of which is visible as a recycled pulsar and the other is not visible .",
    "the majority of about thirty recycled pulsars discovered so far in the galactic disc are found to have white dwarf companions .",
    "four of these systems may have a neutron star companion instead , as is suggested by their mass .",
    "an adequate model of the population of galactic neutron star binaries is highly desirable , as their mergers are currently considered as the most viable sources of detectable bursts of gravitational wave radiation ( @xcite ) and possibly @xmath2-rays (   1986 ) .",
    "estimates of the merger rates of the galactic binaries which contain two neutron stars based on observations are strongly biased by the uncertainties in the pulsar lifetime , beaming factor and the fraction of unobserved low - luminosity pulsars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is useful to investigate the galactic population of neutron star binaries by simulating their formation and the subsequent orbital decay due to gravitational wave radiation and to fit the orbital parameters to observations .",
    "the population of binary neutron stars is a part of the more general family of descendants of massive binaries .",
    "hence , an adequate model has to comply with observations also in the stages preceding the formation of neutron stars ( see meurs & van den heuvel 1989 for an example of this approach ) .    after the pioneering studies of clark et al .",
    "1979 , kornilov & lipunov ( 1984a , b ) and @xcite the formation of single and binary neutron stars and the merger rate of the latter are modelled by , among others tutukov & yungelson ( 1993a , b ) , portegies zwart & spreeuw ( 1996 ) , lipunov ( 1996 , 1997 ) , bagot ( 1996 ) .    since the paper by flannery & van den heuvel ( 1975 )",
    ", a lot of effort was spent on reproduction of the parameters of psr  b1913 + 16 .",
    "but surprisingly , the rest of the family did nt attract much attention .",
    "the primary aim of most studies was to constrain the orbital parameters of _ immediate _ progenitors of high - mass binary pulsars ( hmbp , hereafter ) and kicks imparted to neutron stars ( see  wijers et al .",
    "1992 , yamaoka 1993 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ; bagot 1997 ; lipunov et al .",
    "no attempts were made to restrict the models by simultaneous confrontation with all observed systems and to understand how typical they are in the total inferred population of double neutron stars .",
    "though only four hmbp are definitely known a better understanding of their formation is helpful , as it may provide additional constraints on the probable rate of events accompanying their merger .    in sect .",
    "2 we discuss the formation scenarios for hmbp .",
    "( we use the terms `` neutron star '' as a generic term for the remnant of a high mass star and `` pulsar '' for a neutron star which is observable in radio . )",
    "particular attention is given to the revision of the `` standard '' scenario suggested by brown ( 1995 ) .",
    "section 3 gives the results of our population synthesis computations and the inferred orbital - period  eccentricity diagram for binary neutron stars .",
    "this probability diagram provides a unique opportunity to compare the combined results of evolutionary computations and population synthesis with observations of hmbp .",
    "a requirement for pulsars to be located in the regions of this diagram with high likelihood also allows to constrain the progenitor population and its evolution .",
    "we derive the estimate of the merger rate of the galactic neutron stars from the model which fits best to the observed population .",
    "discussion follows in sect .  4 and conclusions are summarized in sect .  5 .",
    "neutron stars are believed to be born in the supernova explosions triggered by the iron - core collapse in massive stars .",
    "the range of progenitor masses of neutron stars in isolation assumed in the present paper is 8 to 40 .",
    "however , the lower limit may be actually even higher than 10 ; ritossa ( 1996 ) demonstrated that a 10  star ends its evolution as 1.26  oxygen - neon white dwarf .",
    "this would require a reduction of the model occurrence rate of supernovae from single stars by @xmath3 .",
    "if a star is stripped from its hydrogen envelope due to roche - lobe overflow in a close binary the lower mass limit for the formation of a neutron star increases to about 12  .",
    "the necessary condition for the formation of a neutron star is the requirement for the helium star remnant of a binary component to have a mass in excess of about 2.2 to 2.5  ( tutukov & yungelson 1973 ; habets 1985 ) , which enables the formation of a carbon - oxygen core of a chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the upper limit is less well known .",
    "the main factors contributing to this are uncertain stellar mass - loss rates , poor understanding of mixing processes in stellar interiors , the processes during the supernova itself and the uncertainty concerning the equation of state of the compact object which results from the supernova ( see  brown et al .",
    "the `` standard '' assumption is that neutron stars are formed in binaries by stars initially less massive than 40  ( van den heuvel & habets 1984 ) .",
    "however , this limit may be as high as @xmath4    if helium stars have very strong stellar winds ( woosley 1995 ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are indications from theory as well as from observations that this limit may be as low as 20 - 25  ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "1997b and timmes et al .",
    "1996 ) the wide spread in the mass of observed candidate black holes in binaries suggests that there may be factors other than the progenitor mass alone which determines the fate of a star ( ergma & van den heuvel 1997 ) .",
    "the chain of events resulting in the formation of a bound pair of neutron stars is known now for more than 20 years , starting from studies by van den heuvel & heise ( 1972 ) , tutukov & yungelson ( 1973 ) , de loore et al ( 1975 ) , flannery & van den heuvel ( 1975 ) and van den heuvel ( 1976 ) .",
    "let us introduce the notation , , , ,  and , for a main - sequence star , giant , stripped helium core or helium star , the stripped carbon - oxygen core of a helium star , neutron star and a black hole , respectively ( see @xcite for an extended description ) .",
    "a bullet above a stellar type indicates that this star is to experience a supernova explosion in the next evolutionary step .",
    "a subscript @xmath5  means that the orbit of the system is eccentric .",
    "a bound pair is indicated by symbols enclosed by round brackets : two main - sequence stars in a circular orbit are denoted as ( , ) and an eccentric binary neutron star as ( , ) .",
    "a square bracket by the symbol indicates that this star fills its roche lobe and stably transfers mass onto its companion . if the binary experiences a phase of unstable mass transfer the symbols are placed within braces . using this notation",
    "the `` standard '' scenario for the formation of an ( , )  is : @xmath6 actually , all other scenarios for the formation of hmbp differ from scenario  i  in the number of roche - lobe overflow and common envelope events experienced by the binary",
    ". the stages [ , ) and \\ { , } typically are absent for helium stars more massive than @xmath7  which do not expand much beyond @xmath8 after core helium exhaustion (   1971 ; habets 1985 ; woosley 1995 ) .",
    "the strong stellar wind of helium stars may also prevent the occurrence of both phases of mass transfer from the helium star .    a peculiar case are binaries with a primary star initially more massive than @xmath9  and a secondary less massive than 25 to 40  .",
    "they may avoid the first  at all due to their strong stellar wind which may 1 ) prevent them from expanding to a radius exceeding several hundred solar radii and blow away most of their envelopes during the wolf - rayet phase , and 2 ) increase the orbital separation via loss of angular momentum .",
    "however , the secondary star may overflow its roche lobe when it evolves onto the giant branch .",
    "the orbital period subsequently reduces as a result of the spiral - in and the second supernova occurs in a short - period binary .",
    "note that a kick can also decrease the orbital separation upon the formation of the first neutron star .",
    "scenario  i  involves stages when the neutron star is immersed into a common envelope ( the \\ { , } stages and , on some occasions , also \\ { , } ) .",
    "recently certain doubts were expressed concerning this phase based on the work of zeldovich ( 1972 , see also chevalier 1993 ; brown 1995 ; fryer 1996 ) which have shown that neutrino cooling allows hypercritical accretion onto neutron stars , which is o(@xmath10 ) higher than the canonical photon eddington limit of @xmath11   .",
    "common envelopes in massive binary systems may provide suitable conditions for hypercritical accretion ; the net outcome may be the collapse of the neutron star into a black hole . whether or not the binary survives the common envelope and a ( , )  binary forms or the spiral - in continues until both stars merge into a single object is nor clear .",
    "the radical conclusion ( brown 1995 ; wettig & brown 1996 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ) is that the binaries in which neutron star enters a common envelope are not able to produce hmbp .",
    "this reduces the wealth of scenarios for the formation of hmbp to the following one : @xmath12 in scenario ii  both binary components must initially have almost equal mass ( within @xmath13 ) and a primary with a relatively shallow convective envelope .",
    "this allows almost conservative mass exchange in the [ , ) phase .",
    "due to the large amount of mass which is accumulated by the secondary star its evolution raps - up considerably and it can overfill its roche lobe before the primary star explodes as a type ib supernova . the first - born  is subsequently recycled in the stellar wind of its companion helium star .",
    "the stellar wind prevents the helium common envelope phase .",
    "as the outcome of hypercritical accretion is yet not clear , we consider below two options : the formation of a single black hole or the formation of a ( , ) binary for the case where both components do not merge within the common envelope formalism",
    ".    finally , there exist `` wide '' binaries which avoid mass exchange altogether .",
    "both components may evolve independently , if the initial orbital period is @xmath14  days or if the initial mass of the components exceeds 3040  and stellar wind drives the starts apart and prevents . the initial eccentricity is not affected by tidal effects and it is conserved until the first supernova event occurs .",
    "the eccentricity increases the survival probability for the binary when the primary and the secondary subsequently explode in supernovae .",
    "it is likely that kicks prevent formation of ( , )  pairs for ( most of the ) wide binaries .",
    "if one or two are formed anyway , both pulsars will be young and the binary will be visible as two single pulsars which happen to be spatially close for about 10 myr .",
    "detection of binarity of pulsars is possible for orbital periods below @xmath15 yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "binarity might be confirmed for very wide binaries if the proper motion of two stars are the same within about a  ( latham  1984 ) .",
    "detection of a young pulsar in a wide binary may be an _ experimentum crucis _ for the hypothesis claiming that single stars and components of wide binaries do not produce radio pulsars because of the slow spin of the pre - supernova stars ( tutukov  1984 ; iben & tutukov 1996 ) .",
    "it will argue even against the occurrence of kicks within a few tens of   ( portegies zwart  1997a ) .",
    "the neutron star in the close binary which was not disrupted by the first supernova can not be detected as a radio pulsar due to free - free absorption of radio emission in the wind of its companion .",
    "within 10myr to 20myr , before the second supernova occurs , the pulsar passes away .",
    "this first - born `` dead '' pulsar may be posthumously recycled in the stellar wind of its companion and/or during the common envelope phase ( bisnovatyi - kogan & komberg 1975 ; smarr & blandford 1976 ; bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) . the interaction in a binary system is hypothesized to result in a sharp decrease of the magnetic field strength down to @xmath16  g ( see bhattacharya 1996 for a list of suggested hypotheses and their classification ) .",
    "a weak field results in a prolonged lifetime for the recycled pulsar , about two orders of magnitude longer than for a `` regular '' pulsar born with a high magnetic field and with the same pulse period ( see  fig . 1 in @xcite ) .      the crucial stage in the formation of a hmbp in scenario  i  is the common envelope stage in which the envelope of the donor star is expelled from the binary system through the interaction with its companion .",
    "the net result of the common envelope phase is a dramatic reduction in the orbital separation .",
    "estimates of this reduction may be obtained from a comparison of the binding energy of the common envelope @xmath17 with the change of the orbital energy of the binary @xmath18 ( see  iben & livio 1993 ; livio 1996 for discussion ) .",
    "the measure of this ratio is the _ common envelope parameter _ @xmath19 .",
    "tutukov & yungelson ( 1979 ) suggested the following equation for the variation of the separation of binary components in the common envelope ( the donor mass is @xmath20 and its companion has mass @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 where subscripts @xmath23 and @xmath24 refer to the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "this equation is based on the assumption that the spiral - in starts when the envelope surrounding the two cores has dimension of @xmath25 and the envelope is ejected from the gravitational potential of both components .",
    "recent 3-d calculations for the initial stage of formation of common envelopes ( @xcite ) confirm such an assumption , at least qualitatively , by showing that very little mass is expelled during this stage and that the envelope expands considerably .",
    "on the other hand , webbink ( 1984 ) suggested a more straightforward equation for @xmath26 variation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a structural constant which depends on the density profile in the star [ @xmath29 for polytropical models with index @xmath30 ; the usual assumption is @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the common envelope parameter and @xmath33   is the fractional radius of the roche - lobe of the donor .",
    "actually we handle the product  as a single parameter .    for completely non - conservative common envelopes , both equations result in equal @xmath26 for @xmath34 .",
    "confrontation of population - synthesis calculations with observations does not provide very rigorous constraints on the common envelope parameter .",
    "nevertheless , population synthesis of galactic symbiotic stars ( yungelson 1995 ) , be / x - ray binaries ( portegies zwart 1995 ) , supersoft x - ray sources ( yungelson 1996 ) , close binary white dwarfs ( iben 1997 ) and low - mass millisecond pulsars ( tauris 1996 ; tauris & bailes 1996 ) confirms that using a high value of the common - envelope parameter gives a better agreement with the observations . van den heuvel ( 1994 ) finds a reasonable evolutionary scenario with @xmath35 for psr   j2145 - 0750 , a low mass binary pulsar , while for @xmath36   the spin - up of the neutron star in this particular case is problematic .",
    "increasing @xmath37 to values larger than unity decreases the discrepancy between the predicted and observed ratios of the birthrates for neutron star and black hole low - mass x - ray binaries ( see fig .  4 in  1997b ) .",
    "on the basis of 3-d  calculations @xcite claim that the deposition of energy into the common envelope must be highly efficient",
    ". taken at face value , for eq .",
    "[ eqw ] values of @xmath38  mean in that additional energy for the expulsion of the common envelope must come from sources other than the orbital energy .",
    "however , eqs .",
    "[ eqty ] and [ eqw ] are by no means anything more than indicative order of magnitude estimates .",
    "we argue below that reproduction of the distribution function for : the orbital period , the eccentricity and the relative birthrate of observed hmbp are reconciable with high values for the common envelope parameter .      for the present study we used the population synthesis code seba described by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) .",
    "the basic difference with the tutukov & yungelson ( 1993a , b ) code is that they use eq .",
    "[ eqty ] instead of eq .",
    "[ eqw ] which is used by portegies zwart & verbunt for the treatment of binaries which evolve non - conservatively in the semi - detached and common - envelope phases .",
    "a detailed comparison of evolutionary sequences for models with similar initial parameters ( @xcite ) shows that the sets of assumptions in the two codes result in reasonably similar configurations prior to the second supernova explosion in the system ( although the stages in between can be quite different ) .",
    "moreover , the enhancement of the amount of angular momentum loss during non - conservative mass transfer in the present model [ @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 , see eq .",

    "comparison of synthesis studies with the observed population of be / x - ray binaries supports this choice for loss of angular momentum ( portegies zwart 1995 ) . for the present study the mass - loss law in the stellar winds from the helium stars was accepted after langer ( 1989 ) : @xmath42 , which is about twice the value used by @xcite .    after the initial conditions for each binary are selected it",

    "the zero - age parameters of the simulated binary population are selected from independent distribution functions .",

    "for the semi - major axis distribution we explored two options which are consistent with observational data : flat in @xmath48 between 0.1  and @xmath49  ( abt 1983 ) and a gaussian with a mean of @xmath50  and a dispersion of @xmath51   ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) . the eccentricity for a binary was chosen between 0 and 1 from the thermal distribution : @xmath52 .",
    "observations of the space velocities of single radio pulsars suggest that neutron stars may receive a kick at birth ( gunn & ostriker 1970 ) . a clear summing up of arguments for asymmetric kicks is given by van van den heuvel & paradijs ( 1997 ) . following hansen & phinney ( 1996 ) and hartman ( 1997 ) we used the distribution for isotropic kick velocities (   1990 ) @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "when the detectors become sensitive to the events at cosmological distances this population may give an important contribution . * the rate of ( , ) mergers is consistent with the estimated rate of @xmath2-ray bursts if the latter are beamed into an opening angle of @xmath128 .",
    "* the scenario for the evolution of close binary stars which assumes hypercritical accretion and the subsequent collapse of the neutron star into a black hole in the common envelope is able to reproduce binary neutron stars with large orbital periods ( @xmath86days ) , but fails to reproduce the short period systems .",
    "* in the scenario in which a neutron star accretes hypercritically and the binary avoids merging , the galactic population of binaries which contain a black hole and a neutron star might well exceed the number of double neutron stars .",
    "the merger rate of these binaries is then approximately @xmath141 * the number of observed single radio pulsars has to increase to about 2000 , before one can hope to find a young radio pulsar accompanied by a black hole . *",
    "a considerable fraction of the binary neutron stars escape from the tidal field of the galaxy and travel up to @xmath142mpc distances before they coalesce . *",
    "short period neutron star binaries are , due to the high velocities received upon the supernova , virtually all ejected from the shallow potential well of globular star clusters .",
    "high - mass binary pulsars in globular clusters are therefore likely to be formed by a dynamical interaction .",
