    "in recent years , many adaptive filtering algorithms have been used for beamforming , which is a promising and widely investigated technology for rejecting interference and improving the performance of high capacity mobile communications systems @xcite .",
    "many methods have been presented in different communication systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in contrast to fixed beamforming techniques , an adaptive beamformer has the ability of rejecting interference and pointing its mainbeam in the desired direction with the change of scenarios .",
    "blind adaptive beamforming , which is intended to form the array direction response without knowing users information beforehand , is an important topic that deals with interference cancellation , tracking improvement and complexity reduction .",
    "the blind adaptive sg method , which is commonly employed in the blind adaptive beamforming area , is a well - known technique for solving optimization problems with different criteria , e.g. , minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) @xcite , minimum variance ( mv ) @xcite and constant modulus ( cm ) @xcite .",
    "the mv algorithm is a computational efficient approach to estimate the input covariance matrix .",
    "the results in @xcite prove that the mv criterion leads to a solution identical to that obtained from the minimization of the mean squared error ( mse ) .",
    "the cm algorithm for beamforming exploits the low modulus fluctuation exhibited by communications signals using constant modulus constellations to extract them from the array input .",
    "it is well known that the performance of the cm method is superior to that of the mv .",
    "a disadvantage of both two methods is that they are sensitive to the step size .",
    "the small value of the step size will lead to slow convergence rate , whereas a large one will lead to high misadjustment or even instability .",
    "besides , the cm cost function may have local minima , and cm receivers do not have closed - form solutions .",
    "xu and liu @xcite developed a sg algorithm on the basis of the ccm technique to sort out the local minimum problem and obtain the global minima .",
    "but the problem incurred by the step size can not be solved properly .",
    "for accelerating the convergence , recursive least squares ( rls ) algorithms were introduced by xu and tsatsanis using the constrained minimum variance ( cmv ) criterion @xcite and then developed by de lamare and sampaio - neto with the ccm approach @xcite .",
    "the latter , which improves the performance significantly , optimizes a quadratic cost function based on the cm criterion subject to linear constraints for the array weight adaptation .",
    "combining with the constrained condition , this method reaches an optimal solution .",
    "nevertheless , the rls based beamformers can not avoid complicated computations caused by the required correlation matrix inversion .    comparing sg algorithms , which represent simple and low - complexity solutions but subject to slow convergence , with rls methods , which possess fast convergence but high computational load , it is preferable to adopt sg beamformers due to complexity and cost issues . for this reason",
    ", the improvement of blind sg techniques is an important topic and has been investigated for several decades . in this research area , the works in @xcite and @xcite employ standard sg methods with fixed step size ( fss ) that are not efficient with respect to convergence and steady - state performance .",
    "the performance of the beamformer is strongly dependent on the choice of the step size @xcite .",
    "it reflects a tradeoff between misadjustment and the convergence rate . actually , the communication systems are non - stationary environments , which make it very difficult to predetermine the step size .",
    "it is necessary to make the step size track the change of the system automatically and so obtain good convergence behavior .",
    "previous researches have focused on this aim and some good results have been reported .",
    "the adaptive step size ( ass ) mechanism was employed in both the mv @xcite , @xcite and the cm @xcite criteria for improving the performance .",
    "because of requiring an additional update equation for the gradient of the weight vector with respect to the step size , which increases the extra computational load , the applications of these algorithms are limited .",
    "the authors of @xcite propose two novel variable step size mechanisms for mv algorithms .",
    "the simulation experiments show that the new mechanisms are superior to previously reported methods and have a reduced complexity .",
    "this paper proposes two blind ccm beamformers based on two novel adaptive step size mechanisms .",
    "the origins of these mechanisms can be traced back to the works of @xcite and @xcite where low - complexity adaptive step size mechanisms were developed for lms algorithms .",
    "in contrast to @xcite-@xcite , the mechanisms here are designed for ccm algorithms , since it is well - known that they outperform the cmv algorithms @xcite .",
    "because of this reason , the simulations here just compare the algorithms related to the ccm criterion .",
    "the additional number of operations of the proposed algorithms does not depend on the number of sensor elements .",
    "in addition , the results are presented for stationary and non - stationary environments , proving that the new mechanisms could reach better performance and faster convergence behavior than those of previous methods .    the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present a system model for smart antennas .",
    "based on this model , the blind adaptive ccm beamformer design using the sg method is presented in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "the proposed adaptive step size mechanisms are derived .",
    "simulation results are provided in section v , and conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "in order to describe the system structure , let us make two simplifying assumptions for the transmitter and receiver models @xcite .",
    "first , the propagating signals are assumed to be produced by point sources ; that is , the size of the source is small with respect to the distance between the source and the sensors that measure the signal .",
    "second , the sources are assumed to be in the `` far field , '' namely , at a large distance from the sensor array , so that the spherically propagating wave can be reasonably approximated with a plane wave .",
    "besides , we assume a lossless , nondispersive propagation medium , i.e. , a medium that does not attenuate the propagating signal further and the propagation speed is uniform so that the waves travel smoothly .    let us consider the adaptive beamforming scheme in fig . [",
    "fig : model4 ] and suppose that @xmath0 narrowband signals impinge on the uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) sensor elements from the sources with unknown directions of arrival ( doas ) @xmath3,  ,@xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5th snapshot s vector of sensor array outputs can be modeled as @xcite    @xmath6      @xmath16    where @xmath17^{t}\\in\\mathcal{c}^{m\\times 1}$ ] is the complex weight vector , and @xmath18 stands for the hermitian transpose .",
    "the purpose of sg algorithms is to get an acceptable output performance and reduce the complexity load by avoiding the correlation matrix estimation and inversion .",
    "we describe the ccm algorithm on the basis of the sg method , which is called ccm - sg .    for the ccm - sg algorithm",
    ", we consider the cost function as the expected deviation of the squared modulus of the array output to a constant , say 1 .",
    "the ccm cost function is simply a positive measure of the average amount that the beamformer output deviates from the unit modulus condition @xcite . by using the constraint condition ,",
    "the cost function of ccm - sg can be expressed as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the steering vector of the desired signal .",
    "the constrained optimization means that the technique minimizes the contribution of the undesired interferences while maintaining the gain along the look direction to be constant .",
    "the sg blind adaptive algorithm optimizes the lagrangian cost function described by    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is a scalar lagrange multiplier",
    ". the solution can be obtained by setting the gradient terms of ( [ 4 ] ) with respect to @xmath23(i ) equal to zero and using the constraint .",
    "thus , we obtain    @xmath24 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 here is the step size , which is a fixed value for fss and a variable value for ass and @xmath26 denotes complex conjugate .    because of the shortcomings introduced before for both fss and ass algorithms , it is necessary to develop other methods for improving the performance of sg method .",
    "in this section , two novel adaptive step size methods are described for adjusting the step size following the change of the communication system .",
    "the step size adjustment is controlled by the square prediction error , which means that a large error will cause the step size to increase for providing fast tracking while a small error will result in a decrease of step size to yield smaller misadjustment .",
    "the computational complexity is not a problem in these mechanisms .",
    "the first proposed algorithm based on the mass mechanism employs the prediction error and uses the update rule    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the same as that in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the rationale for the mass is that for large prediction error the algorithm will make the step size increase to track the change of the system whereas a small error will result in a decrease of the step size .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is an independent variable for controlling the prediction error and scaling it at different levels .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the step size @xmath32 should be limited in a range as follows    @xmath33    where @xmath34 .",
    "the constant @xmath35 is chosen as a compromise between the satisfying level of steady - state misadjustment and the required minimum level of tracking ability while @xmath36 is normally selected close to the point of instability of the algorithm for providing the maximum convergence speed .",
    "the mass is the result of several attempts to devise a simple and effective mechanism .",
    "the second mechanism , which is called taass , uses a time average estimate of the correlation of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the update rule is    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the limits on @xmath32 , @xmath42 and @xmath31 are similar to those of the mass algorithm .",
    "the exponential weighting parameter @xmath43 governs the averaging time constant , namely , the quality of the estimation .",
    "previous samples , in stationary environments , contain information that is related to determine an accurate measure for the proximity of the adaptive beamformer coefficients to the optimal ones .",
    "here , @xmath43 should be close to @xmath44 . for non - stationary environments ,",
    "the time averaging window should be small for deleting the deep past data and leaving space for the current statistics adaption , so , @xmath45 .",
    "there are two objectives for using @xmath46 here .",
    "first , it rejects the effect of the uncorrelated noise sequence on the step - size update @xcite . in the beginning , because of scarcity of transmitters information , the error correlation estimate @xmath47 is large and so @xmath48 is large to increase the convergence rate and to track the change of input data .",
    "as it approaches the optimum , @xmath47 is very small , resulting in a small step size for ensuring low misadjustment near optimum .",
    "second , the error correlation is generally a good measure of the proximity to the optimum .      in this part",
    ", both the computational complexity and the convergence behavior of the proposed mechanisms based on the ccm criterion are investigated .",
    "the computational complexities of the proposed mass and taass mechanisms are analyzed .",
    "it is well known that the computational complexity of the ass algorithm is a linear monotonic increasing function of the number of sensor elements ( in awgn model ) , i.e. , the complexity will increase following the increase of the number of sensor elements .",
    "therefore , the computational complexity becomes very large if the array size is big .",
    "an important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they only require a few fixed number of operations for updating the step size compared with that of the ass method , which is proportional to the number of sensor elements .",
    "the additional computational complexity of the proposed adaptive step size mechanisms is listed in table [ tab : complexity ] .",
    ".additional computational complexity of proposed algorithms [ cols=\"^,<,^,<,^ , < \" , ]      considering the space limitation , we just give the range of the step size for convergence .",
    "for further analysis , we assume that @xmath48 varies slowly around its mean value .",
    "this assumption is approximately true if @xmath31 is small and @xmath42 closes to one , which will be shown in the simulations . under this condition , according to @xcite , we have    @xmath49\\\\ & = e[\\mu(i)]e[(|y(i)|^{2}-1)y^{\\ast}(i)[\\boldsymbol x(i)-\\boldsymbol a^{h}(\\theta_{0})\\boldsymbol x(i)\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_{0 } ) ] ] \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath50\\boldsymbol w(i)=e[\\mu(i)]\\boldsymbol r_{ccm}\\boldsymbol w(i)\\ ] ]    where @xmath51\\in\\mathcal c^{m\\times m}$ ] .",
    "now , the weight vector update equation ( [ 5 ] ) of the blind adaptive ccm beamformer can be written as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 .",
    "define the weight error vector @xmath54 and substitute ( [ 11 ] ) into the expression , we get    @xmath55    employing ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) and taking expectations on both sides of ( [ 12 ] ) , we get    @xmath56=(\\boldsymbol i - e[\\mu(i)]\\boldsymbol r_{vx}(i))e[\\boldsymbol e_{w}(i)]\\ ] ]    where @xmath57=(\\boldsymbol i-\\boldsymbol a(\\theta_{0})\\boldsymbol a^{h}(\\theta_{0}))\\boldsymbol r_{ccm}$ ] and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath59\\rightarrow \\boldsymbol w_{opt}$ ] or equivalently , @xmath60 $ ] represents the stable condition if and only if @xmath61\\boldsymbol r_{vx})\\rightarrow 0 $ ] . following the idea of the eigenstructure @xcite with respect to the correlation matrix @xmath62 , the sufficient condition for ( [ 13 ] ) to hold implies that    @xmath63\\leq \\frac{2}{\\lambda^{vx}_{max}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 is the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath62 .",
    "the performances of the proposed mass and taass algorithms are compared with other existing algorithms , namely fss and ass , in terms of output signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "an ula containing @xmath65 sensor elements with half - wavelength spacing is considered .",
    "the noise is spatially and temporally white gaussian noise with power @xmath66 . for each scenario ,",
    "@xmath67 iterations are used to get each simulated curve . in all simulations ,",
    "the desired signal power is @xmath68 .",
    "the bpsk modulation scheme is employed to modulate the signals .",

    "[ fig : vssmismatch](a ) shows the output sinr of each method versus the number of snapshots , whose total is @xmath69 samples .",
    "there are five interferers in the system , one interferer with @xmath70 db above the desired user s power level , one with the same power level of the desired one and three with power @xmath71 db lower than that of the desired user . in this environment ,",
    "the actual spatial signature of the signal is known exactly .",
    "we set the first element of the initial weight vector @xmath72 equals to the corresponding element of steering vector of soi @xmath20 .",
    "other parameters are optimized with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for mass and @xmath73 , @xmath78,@xmath74 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath77 for taass .",
    "we claim that the parameters for the fss and ass are tuned in order to minimize the performance , allowing for a fair comparison with the proposed algorithms .",
    "the results show that the proposed algorithms converge faster and have better performances than the existing algorithms .",
    "the steering vector mismatch scenario is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vssmismatch](b ) .",
    "we assume that this steering vector error problem is caused by look direction mismatch .",

    "[ fig : vssmismatch](a ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : vssmismatch](b ) indicates that the mismatch problem leads to a worse performance for all the solutions .",
    "the convergence rate of all the methods reduces whereas the devised algorithms are more robust to this mismatch , especially for the taass approach , which reaches the steady - state very quickly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vssmoreusers ] , the system starts with @xmath70 interferers , two of which have the same power as that of the desired signal and the rest of them with the power @xmath71 db lower than the desired one .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , sinrs of all the algorithms reduce at the same time .",
    "it is clear that the performance degradation of the proposed ones is much less significant than those of the other methods .",
