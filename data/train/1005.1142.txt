    "<S> a reproducing cell is a difficult problem ; however , it is essential to fully understand this relationship to unveil the origin of life , to establish a theory for a living state , and to experimentally synthesize protocells@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical attempts to understand the relationship have been made by using catalytic networks@xcite . for reproduction of cells , </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to replicate functional polymers . at a primitive stage of life , </S>",
    "<S> however , errors in the sequence of polymers are inevitable during their replications , which prevent the transfer of information through replications . </S>",
    "<S> this was pointed out by eigen and schuster as an error catastrophe@xcite . to resolve this error - catastrophe problem , they@xcite proposed a hypercycle in which different molecular species mutually catalyzed the replication of each other . </S>",
    "<S> this hypercycle , however , introduced another problem , i.e. , it led to the emergence of parasitic molecules that are catalyzed by other molecules but do not in turn catalyze other molecules . </S>",
    "<S> because such parasitic molecules are in a majority , the reproduction of mutually catalytic molecules can not be sustained .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible way to resolve the problem of parasitism is to use compartmentalization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when molecules are compartmentalized in a protocell , the unit of selection is shifted from a molecule to a protocell . </S>",
    "<S> then , the protocells dominated by parasites are selected out , leaving behind protocells without parasites . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a compartmentalization introduces further complexity to the primitive form of life . it might be beneficial to use other molecules that act as a membrane </S>",
    "<S> ; however , these molecules also need to be replicated . </S>",
    "<S> a specific reaction - diffusion mechanism to create compartments is also proposed@xcite . to avoid the further introduction of complexity , it is important to develop a simple mechanism for compartmentalization of a protocell .    </S>",
    "<S> another important issue associated with protocells is the origin of heredity , i.e. , the existence of specific molecules ( such as dna in the present cell ) that are well preserved in the offspring cells and also control the behavior of the cells . by considering a simple hypercycle with only two chemicals , we have previously shown that the chemical with a slower synthesis rate and ( as a result ) that in minority plays the role of a heredity - carrier molecule . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the relevance of such minority molecules in the hypercycle for evolvability and for the elimination of parasites is demonstrated@xcite . here again , reaction in a compartment and the division of such a protocell was assumed .    here , we address the following questions . </S>",
    "<S> can we explain the origin of a protocell with compartmentalization and its growth - division cycle , in terms of a reaction - diffusion process with minority molecules ? how does the division process of protocells maintain synchrony with the replication of such minority molecules ( i.e. , what is the relationship between cell division and replication of dna ? ) ? </S>",
    "<S> we address these questions by simply introducing spatial diffusion of molecules and catalytic reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we use the physicists golden rule to study one the most simplest systems , i.e. , a system consisting of only two chemical species that mutually catalyze the replication of each other , with the brownian motion of molecules . from the results of a stochastic simulation , we show that the difference between the synthesis speed of the two molecular species leads not only to the formation of compartments as a cluster of such molecules but also to their recursive division with a certain cell size , even though no complicated mechanisms are assumed . here , the localization of molecules around a minority molecule leads to compartmentalization , whereas infrequent replication of such a minority molecule induces the division of a compartment . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the reproduction of a protocell , which is essentially a cluster of molecules , progresses in synchrony with the replication of a minority molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that this reproduction process tenaciously resists parasites .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two molecular species that mutually catalyze the replication of each other . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction processes are expressed as follows : @xmath0 @xmath1 the first process represents mutual catalytic replication with rate @xmath2 , where the synthesis fractions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the second process represents the natural decomposition of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .    because it is necessary to ensure discreteness in a molecular number , we adopt stochastic simulations rather than reaction - diffusion equations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the importance of ensuring discreteness in the molecular number has been discussed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also take into account crowded molecules , and we assume that both @xmath3 and @xmath4 molecules have a spherical shape with the same diameter ( @xmath9 ) . these molecules are confined to a box with dimensions @xmath10 , with elastic boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> further , these molecules have the same mass and diffusion constant ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> their motions obey the overdamped langevin equations , which are numerically integrated by the ermak - mccammon algorithm@xcite , such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a gaussian white noise such that @xmath14 with temperature @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the boltzmann constant . in the simulation , </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath17.the interaction potential @xmath18 between molecules is a hertzian potential , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 with an energy unit @xmath21 , and the characteristic length scale @xmath9 ( i.e. , the diameter ) of molecules and @xmath22 is a heaviside step function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we start our simulation with the initial condition in which a single molecule @xmath4 is surrounded by @xmath3 molecules@xcite .    at each time step , if the distance between every pair of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is shorter than @xmath9 , the replication reaction occurs with a probability @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , @xmath2 denotes the rate of replicating molecules per unit time under a crowded condition , i.e. , when a pair of @xmath3 and @xmath4 overlaps . </S>",
    "<S> if the reaction occurs , a new molecule @xmath3 or @xmath4 is added to the system , with probability @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the reaction rate for the replication of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a single reaction pair is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the new molecule is chosen as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the center between the reaction pair and @xmath28 , which is randomly chosen from @xmath29 , by also avoiding overlap with other molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the decomposition process is carried out to remove all @xmath3(@xmath4 ) molecules , with a probability @xmath30 at each step . here </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the parameters as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and study the behavior of the system against the changes in the independent parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , while @xmath5 is set as @xmath34 without loss of generality .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we examine the formation of a cluster by considering a single @xmath4 molecule and suppressing its replication and decomposition ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath7 is large , none of the @xmath3 molecules remain to exist , whereas a stationary cluster of @xmath3 molecules is formed around the single @xmath4 molecule when @xmath7 is sufficiently small . for it , we fix @xmath36 in the following . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we have computed the density distribution function @xmath37 of @xmath3 as a function of distance @xmath38 from the single @xmath4 . the tail of the function for a large @xmath38 is fitted well by the isotropic steady - state solution of the diffusion equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 . for a small @xmath38 , the value of the function is suppressed without @xmath41-divergence owing to crowded molecules . under the crowded condition , @xmath3 and @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> continuously overlap each other in the replication reaction . </S>",
    "<S> then , the replication rate of @xmath3 by a single @xmath4 molecule , denoted as @xmath42 , is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the average number of @xmath3 molecules that overlap with the single @xmath4 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> in the present simulations , @xmath45@xcite . under the present crowded condition , </S>",
    "<S> the number of @xmath3 molecules , @xmath46 , in a steady cluster is estimated by the balance between the replication and decomposition of @xmath3 molecules , as @xmath47 . by using @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , we then estimate @xmath46 as @xmath48 , which is consistent with numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we consider the replication of @xmath4 molecules with a rate that is slower than that of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> first , in fig . [ fig:1 ] , we show an example of the growth - division process of a cluster and provide the condition for it later . </S>",
    "<S> this process occurs as follows . for most of the time , </S>",
    "<S> the cluster maintains itself by replicating the @xmath3 molecules , whereas the replication of the @xmath4 molecule rarely occurs . </S>",
    "<S> once the @xmath4 molecule replicates , the distance between the two @xmath4 molecules is increased by diffusion , and these molecules contribute to the replication of @xmath3 molecules . as the two @xmath4 molecules gradually move away from each other , the spatial distribution of @xmath3 , synthesized by each @xmath4 , starts to elongate in the direction of the two @xmath4 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> since the decomposition of the @xmath3 molecule is dominant because it is located away from a @xmath4 molecule , the cluster of @xmath3 molecules forms a dumbbell shape , and it finally splits into two ( see also supplementary movies in @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for this growth - division cycle to repeat , there is a restriction on the values of several parameters . </S>",
    "<S> first , the replication of @xmath4 should be sufficiently slow . after the replication of a new @xmath4 molecule , it takes some time for the two @xmath4 molecules to be separated at a distance of the size of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> if another replication of @xmath4 occurs during this time , the cluster of @xmath3 molecules can not split into two because the replication of @xmath3 molecules by the third @xmath4 molecule already begins . </S>",
    "<S> second , the decay rate of @xmath4 should be sufficiently low . </S>",
    "<S> if this is not the case , the @xmath4 molecules would completely disappear before the division of a cluster . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it should be noted that the cluster splits by the decomposition of @xmath3 so that its rate @xmath7 is higher than @xmath8 .    . </S>",
    "<S> the green semitransparent particles represent the @xmath3 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the red particles represent the @xmath4 molecules , located deep within the clusters . </S>",

    "<S> the parameter values are @xmath50 , @xmath36 , and @xmath51 . , height=207 ]    by taking several parameter values for @xmath6 and @xmath8 , we have plotted the time evolution of the total number of molecules by starting from a single-@xmath4 initial condition in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have found the following three typical behaviors : extinction , division , and explosion . in the extinction phase , all the molecules decay , and </S>",
    "<S> finally no molecules remain . in the parameters shown in this figure , </S>",
    "<S> extinction is initiated by the decomposition of a single @xmath4 molecule , followed by the extinction of @xmath3 molecules because there are no more replications . here , first , the number of molecules fluctuates at around a constant value , corresponding to a single cluster , and then , it suddenly decreases with the disappearance of the @xmath4 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> ( when @xmath7 is considerably larger than @xmath8 , the extinction of @xmath3 molecules precedes that of @xmath4 . )    in the division behavior , a stepwise increase in the total number of molecules is observed . for reference </S>",
    "<S> , we also plot dotted lines in fig.2 at the level of several multiples of the number of molecules in a single cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of molecules fluctuates around one of the dotted lines and gradually increases , as is consistent with the division process of a certain size of a cluster . in the explosion case , </S>",
    "<S> the number of molecules show an exponential increase without a step - like behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the number of molecules increases by maintaining a single cluster . </S>",
    "<S> typical snapshots of the division and explosion cases are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , where the green particles represent the @xmath3 molecules .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] , a phase diagram of these three behaviors is plotted on the @xmath52-@xmath8 plane by fixing the decay rate of @xmath3 at @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the three phases are separated in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the division phase lies at smaller @xmath52 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in @xmath8 leads to extinction , whereas an increase in @xmath52 leads to explosion . </S>",
    "<S> near the boundary between the division and the extinction phases , the corresponding two behaviors coexist , depending on each sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries between the phases are estimated as follows . in the case of the boundary of the extinction phase , we note the balance between the replication and the decay of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the replication rate of a @xmath4 molecule in the cluster is estimated by @xmath53 , and the decay rate is estimated by @xmath54 . in the case of the division phase , the replication rate of @xmath4 should be greater than its decay rate so that the region satisfies @xmath55 this boundary is plotted in the @xmath52-@xmath8 plane , which is consistent with our simulation results .    </S>",
    "<S> the boundary between the division and the explosion phases is estimated by the balance between the replication rate of @xmath4 and the size of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the linear size of a single cluster , @xmath56 , is estimated by @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the division process starts by the replication of @xmath4 and is completed when the two @xmath4 molecules diffuse approximately to the distance @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the typical timescale of dividing processes by @xmath58 , and we obtain @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the effective diffusion constant of @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath60 is slightly increased from @xmath61 because of the repulsive interactions with @xmath3 molecules , and it is estimated as @xmath62 from the simulations for fig.3 ..    at the phase boundary , only a single replication of @xmath4 should occur during this time @xmath58 to complete the division , so that @xmath63 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the boundary is expressed as @xmath65 the estimated boundary is plotted in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters are @xmath33 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the plane is divided into the following three regions : extinction ( @xmath66 ) , division ( @xmath67 ) , and explosion ( @xmath68 ) . at the parameters with @xmath69 points , two behaviors of the adjacent regions </S>",
    "<S> coexist . </S>",
    "<S> we also plot the theoretically estimated boundaries given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ b2]).,width=302 ]    in summary , we have studied a simple reaction system of two mutually catalytic molecules that diffuse under a crowded condition . when the replication speed considerably differs between the two molecular species , the molecule with a slower replication rate becomes a minority molecule , and the minority molecule leads to the formation of a cluster of molecules and its division into two clusters as a result of replication of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> this division is repeated to produce protocells of a certain size . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented the simulation results for a three - dimensional case ; however , we have confirmed the existence of the present three phases , in particular , the division of a protocell in a two - dimensional case .    to further examine whether the present protocell resists parasitic molecules , </S>",
    "<S> we have also extended our model to include parasitic molecules @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are catalyzed by other molecular species but can not catalyze the replication of other molecules . if the variety and/or replication rates of the parasites are large , they would dominate . </S>",
    "<S> protocells dominated by parasites , however , stop growing and eventually disappear , whereas cells that are not infected by parasites continue to grow and divide ( see supplementary material and movie@xcite ) . in particular , it is observed that when parasite @xmath71 appears , it is spontaneously emitted from the cluster , so that @xmath71 parasites are eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath71 can not synthesize @xmath3 ; therefore , it can not remain at the center of the cluster , and it diffuses out of the cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the reaction scheme given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rep ] ) is extremely simplified . for such reactions to progress , some resources are necessary for the synthesis of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . if such resources are sufficiently supplied , the original model ( eq . ( [ rep ] ) ) is derived . in reality , however , these resources have to be supplied from the outside@xcite . as the size of the cluster increases , </S>",
    "<S> their supply can not be penetrated deeper into the cluster ; therefore , replication is limited only at the periphery , whereas decomposition occurs in a bulk . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the growth of a cluster without division stops when the cluster achieves a certain size . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when the cluster divides into two before it reaches the size threshold , the molecules continue to replicate .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the formation of a compartment and its growth - division cycle are shown to be a natural outcome of mutually catalytic reactions with a minority molecule species . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , this division of a protocell is synchronized with the replication of the minority molecule . </S>",
    "<S> as already discussed , the minority molecule @xmath4 can act as a carrier of heredity , as it is preserved well , controls the characteristic of the protocells , and gives evolvability@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the replication of this minority molecule is synchronized with the division of a protocell . </S>",
    "<S> these characteristics of the minority molecule @xmath4 agree well with those required by genetic information , played by dna in the present cell . </S>",
    "<S> the question about the origin of genetic information from catalytic reactions , addressed by dyson@xcite , is thus answered .    </S>",
