    "a great deal about galaxy evolution can be learned by studying their broadband properties .",
    "broadband observations give an immediate impression of the spectral energy distribution and thereby information on stellar and dust content .",
    "even though integrated magnitudes of galaxies can be used to study global properties of galaxies , even more can be learned from examining the detailed distribution of their light and colors .",
    "the star formation history in galaxies seems to be related to their surface density properties ( kennicutt  @xcite ; ryder and dopita  @xcite ; de jong  @xcite ) , and therefore it is imperative to have a statistical knowledge of surface brightness distributions in galaxies to understand galaxy evolution .",
    "the image data set presented here was collected to study the surface brightness distribution of spiral galaxies .",
    "of especial interest was the question whether disks in spiral galaxies have a preferred central surface brightness value as proposed by freeman  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were made in such a way that they were suitable to study this central surface brightness effect , but this might make the observations less useful for some other studies due to two limitations .",
    "( 1 ) disk central surface brightnesses are in general determined from one - dimensional ( 1d ) luminosity profiles , constructed by some kind of azimuthal averaging of the light distribution .",
    "no effort was made to obtain images with high signal - to - noise per pixel , as large numbers of pixels were to be averaged in the process of creating luminosity profiles .",
    "furthermore the  depth \" of the optical images were matched to the near - ir observations , which are more limited by the high sky background level than by signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "a considerable fraction of the images have too low signal - to - noise per pixel to allow detailed morphological studies of non - axisymmetric structures ( ie .",
    "bars and spiral arms ) except in the highest surface brightness regions .",
    "( 2 ) the used telescope / camera combinations had a limited field - of - view , especially in the near - ir .",
    "often only the major axis was imaged of the larger galaxies , as this was sufficient to measure the radial luminosity distribution of the galaxy .",
    "this again limits the usefulness of the images to study non - axisymmetric light distributions in the outer part of galaxies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : the selection of the sample is described in section  2 and the observations in section  3 .",
    "section  4 explains the different data reduction techniques used . in section  5",
    "i describe the format of the fits images on the cd - rom , in section  6 the format of the luminosity profiles and in section  7 the format of the bulge / disk decomposition files . a more detailed description of the selection , observations and data reduction can be found in paper  i. the bulge / disk decomposition methods",
    "are explained in more detail in paper  ii .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the uppsala general catalogue of galaxies ( ugc , nilson  @xcite ) .",
    "only spiral galaxies in the range s1-dwarfsp were selected , excluding galaxies with classifications as s0-s1 , sb0-sb1 , s3-irr , irr and dwarf irr .",
    "ideally one would like to have a volume - limited sample of galaxies for a statistical study of galaxy properties , but this is impossible due to selection effects . to create a sample that is correctable for selection effects , the galaxies were selected to have ugc red diameters of at least 2 .",
    "the galaxies have red ugc minor over major axis ratios larger than 0.625 to reduce problems with projection effects and dust extinction .",
    "this axis ratio range corresponds to inclinations less than approximately 51 .",
    "only galaxies with an absolute galactic latitude @xmath6  were selected , to minimize the effect of galactic extinction and to reduce the number of foreground stars .",
    "these selection criteria resulted in a sample of 368 galaxies .",
    "the final sample of 86 galaxies observed was selected on the basis of hour angle and declination only , in such a way that we had about equal number of observable galaxies during the whole night in the granted observing time .",
    "the total selected areas cover about 12.5% of the sky .",
    "all global parameters of the observed galaxies are listed in table  [ globpar ] .",
    "nearly all _ bvri _ images were obtained with the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at la palma , equipped with a 385x578 gec ccd camera , in march and september 1991 and april 1992 .",
    "the kitt peak _ bvri _ filter set ( rgo / la palma technical notes  @xcite ) was used , the pixel size was 0.3 .",
    "the ccd camera was used in both its normal imaging mode as well as in its driftscan mode . in driftscan mode ,",
    "optimal use is made of the way ccds are designed : while the telescope is tracking the object , the ccd camera is shifted under the telescope at the same speed as the image is shifted down the columns of the ccd while it is read out .",
    "typical exposure times were 600s in @xmath0 and 400s for the other optical passbands .",
    "twilight flatfields were obtained at the beginning or at the end of the night and globular cluster fields with standard stars were observed at regular intervals through the night for calibration .",
    "a small number of optical observations were obtained from the la palma archive .",
    "the near - ir @xmath4 and @xmath5 passband observations were made at the united kingdom infrared telescope at hawaii with ircam  ii containing a 58x62 insb array . during the february 1992 run standard @xmath4 and @xmath5 filters were used , but a @xmath7 filter was used in september 1991 .",
    "the pixel size was 1.2 .",
    "for accurate sky subtraction and flatfielding sky frames were obtained before and after every two object frames at a position offset a few arcmin from the object .",
    "images were taken in a strip along the major axis of the galaxies , spending about twice as much time on the outer part of galaxies than on the central region to increase signal - to - noise in these low surface brightness regions .",
    "calibration stars from the list of elias et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were imaged at regular intervals .",
    "dark frames with exposure times equal to the object exposure times were also obtained at regular intervals .",
    "the full observing log with observing method ( driftscan , mosaic ) , exposure times , photometric quality and seeing estimates can be found in paper  i. these values are also store in the fits headers of the images .",
    "the normal data reduction procedure for ccd data was followed to create calibrated images from the direct imaging data obtained with the jkt .",
    "a bias value was subtracted from the images using the average value in the overscan region .",
    "the images were divided by normalized flatfields created by averaging several twilight frames .",
    "no dark current was subtracted as this was found to be insignificant for this ccd . in general two observations at the same position of an object were made , which allowed cosmic - ray removal when they were averaged .",
    "the data reduction of the driftscans was more elaborate .",
    "a driftscan image consists of a ramp up part ( rows that were not exposed for a full chip length before being read out ) , a flat fully - exposed part and a ramp down part ( rows that are read out after the shutter has closed ) .",
    "the first rows of the ramp up part showed a gradient in the bias level in the cross - scan direction .",
    "therefore , the bias level was determined by fitting the first half of the ramp up part of each column , giving a bias level for each column at the first row .",
    "the images were flatfielded by flatlines created averaging normal flatfields in column direction .",
    "the ramp up and down parts were corrected for the shorter exposure times , extending the field - of - view beyond the area that was exposed to the sky for a full chip length .",
    "careful attention had to be given to flatfielding of the near - ir images , as flux levels 5@xmath8 times below the sky level were measured .",
    "we first subtracted the dark current from all near - ir images ( object and sky ) using the average of the two dark frames obtained nearest in time .",
    "a normalized flatfield image was created for each galaxy by taking the median of the 4 - 5 sky frames observed around the galaxy .",
    "after flatfielding , known  hot \" and  dead \" pixels were set to  undefined \" by a bad pixel mask and remaining dubious pixels were set to ",
    "undefined by hand .",
    "these  undefined \" pixels were not used in further analysis .",
    "the different object frames of a galaxy were mosaiced together to create a full image along the major axis .",
    "the spatial offset between frames was determined by a cross - correlation technique or by using the telescope offsets if no structure was available to be used in the cross - correlation technique .",
    "the relative spatial offsets between all overlapping frame combinations were determined and a least - square - fit determined the relative offset of all frames with respect to the central frame . zero point ( due to sky fluctuations ) and intensity scaling factors ( only for non - photometric observations ) were determined in a similar fashion .",
    "all zero point ( and when necessary intensity ) offsets between overlapping frames ( using the just determined spatial offsets ) were calculated and a least - squares - fit through all relative offsets provided the intensity offset with respect to the central frame .",
    "all frames were mosaiced together using these spatial and intensity offsets , taking the average in the overlapping areas .",
    "the images were calibrated using the standard star fields observed during each night under different airmasses .",
    "the optical standard star fields we used were calibrated to landolt ( @xcite ) stars , and therefore our system response has been transformed to johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 and kron - cousins @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the near - ir was calibrated to @xmath4 and @xmath5 standard stars of elias et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , using the corrections of wainscoat and cowie  ( @xcite ) to transform the @xmath7 passband to the @xmath5 passband .",
    "instrumental magnitudes ( -2.5log(number of counts ) ) of the different stars in the calibration fields were measured with daophot ( stetson  @xcite ) .",
    "all photometric calibration measurements of one observing run were combined to least - square - fit equations of the form : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the standard star magnitudes , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 the instrumental magnitudes per second , @xmath15 the airmass of the observation and @xmath16 the unknown transformation coefficients . the results of these fits can be found in tables  [ mag0tab ] and [ mag0tabir ] and in the fits headers of the images .",
    "non - photometric observations were calibrated with aperture photometry from the literature when available .",
    "we first determined magnitudes in synthetic apertures of the size of the literature photometry using the calibration of a photometric night .",
    "if our magnitude differed more than the expected error from the literature value , all magnitude parameters were corrected for this difference ( indicated by header item corr in the fits files ) .",
    "the optical pixel size was determined to be 0.303@xmath170.004 , using images of globular clusters which contained accurately known star positions .",
    "this pixel size agreed to within its uncertainty to the instrumental specification , and therefore a value of 0.30  was adopted .",
    "the near - ir pixel size was derived from the scaling factor to align the near - ir images with the optical images ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "the near - ir pixel size was 1.20  per pixel .",
    "we determined the sky background level on the fully reduced images using the box method .",
    "average sky values were measured in small boxes around the galaxies .",
    "sky level was set to the median value of these measurements .",
    "the uncertainty in the sky value was taken to be half the difference between the maximum and minimum average sky values found in these boxes .",
    "this uncertainty will reflect errors due to imperfect flatfielding and mosaicing .",
    "we aligned the images in the different passbands using foreground stars in common between the different frames .",
    "images obtained during the same observing run were only allowed to shift , between different runs also rotation and scaling was allowed .",
    "the near - ir data was regridded to the much smaller pixel scale of the optical images , which means that nothing smaller than the original pixel size ( 1.2 ) should be trusted on these images .",
    "a linear interpolation was used for regridding and therefore the new smaller pixels contain values that are representative of the original surface brightness in the pixels of the original size .",
    "total flux in the image is not conserved in this process , but the original number of counts in an area can easily be calculated by multiplying the new number of counts in an area with the ratio of the square of the pixel sizes , ( pixelsize@xmath18/pixelsize@xmath19)@xmath20 .",
    "all aligned images are stored in fits format on the cd - rom in the directory images/ , with a separate directory for each galaxy .",
    "the aligned near - ir images in these directories have been compressed with gzip , but the `` raw '' near - ir images ( ie .  before aligning and regridding to the optical images )",
    "are available in uncompressed fits format in the directory irimages/. the fits headers contain all the essential information for analysis .",
    "the images are in analog - to - digital - units ( adu ) , which corresponds approximately to the number of detected photons for the optical images and to 50 detected photons in the near - ir images .",
