    "discovered as the first star to show balmer line emission in its spectrum @xcite , @xmath0cas   has long been held out as _ the prototype _ for what became known by the mid-20th century as a large class of  classical be \" variables.cas  stars \" is distinct from the definition given in the general catalog of variable stars , e.g. , @xcite , and is framed within the context of x - ray characteristics , as discussed herein .",
    "] however , with the discovery of anomalously high x - ray flux from the direction of this star @xcite , it eventually was revealed that it is not a typical be star after all - be stars at large emit at most a few times more soft x - ray flux than normal b stars @xcite , ostensibly due to shock interactions in their intermediate latitude hot winds .",
    "as we will see , the study of the generation of hard x - rays from a class of so - called ",
    "@xmath0cas  stars \" links a wide field of astrophysical subdiscipines . in addition , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  n13  ) have noted that @xmath0cas  stars contribute very significantly to the x - ray flux emitted from galactic massive stars .",
    "this makes them relevant to an understanding of the energy budget of the interstellar medium ( ism ) as well as the evolutionary consequences of noncataclysmic expulsions of matter from be binary systems .",
    "the saga begins with the discovery that @xmath0cas  is not just an x - ray source but a copious emitter of hard x - rays @xcite .",
    "this realization started something of a cottage industry aimed to develop an understanding of the mechanisms behind its surprising x - ray properties .",
    "the initial concept , which had been successfully applied to the generation of high energy for almost all high mass x - ray be binary stars , is that the x - rays result from synchrotron emission ( for a strongly magnetic secondary ) and/or thermalization of accreted matter onto the surface , accretion column , or accretion disk hosted by a degenerate companion . in any of these scenarios the high energy emission ultimately results from the deep gravitational potential of the degenerate secondary .",
    "white et al . professed ",
    "little doubt \" that @xmath0cas  is a be - ns ( neutron star ) system similar to the well known x - ray pulsar xper .",
    "the reason for this judgment was that the light curve showed in their words a  factor of 2 quasi - periodic variations on a timescale similar to the pulsations from xper .",
    "\" here they anticipated a timescale of 13.9 minutes , which is the pulse period in this x - ray pulsar .",
    "in addition , white et al . rejected coronal and white dwarf ( wd ) accretion mechanisms . in the latter case they made this judgment because the x - ray luminosity was considered too high for wd accretion , according to the mass loss rate estimated for @xmath0cas .   despite these arguments",
    "it soon became clear that @xmath0cas   is not just another example of a be - ns system .      by the end of the 20th century new generations of x - ray   satellites",
    "provided data with improved spectral and time resolution .",
    "these data clarified the x - ray properties of @xmath0cas  and a small number of  analog \" members of this class and also established that the spectra were thermal and optically thin in nature .",
    "also , the amassing of new light curves could not corroborate claims of persistent periodicities .",
    "breakthroughs in evaluating the x - ray characteristics came from the advent of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite , with its design purpose of providing reliable high time resolution light curves through the use of its six detectors comprising the _ proportion counter array ( pca ) _ , and from the appearance of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ satellites equipped with high resolution spectrometers sensitive to soft - to medium band flux ( which we define somewhat arbitrarily as @xmath63kev , i.e. , @xmath74 ) .",
    "the new generation light curves demonstrated that flux variability occurs on four basic timescales : rapid ( seconds to a minute ) , intermediate ( a few hours ) , long ( a few months ) , and episodic ( years ) .",
    "meanwhile , results from turn - of - the - century x - ray spectrometers have indicated that the x - ray spectra are _ basically _ thermal .",
    "we clarify the qualifier  basically \" as follows .",
    "first , one finds the continuum and the lyman@xmath5 lines of fexxv ( 1.85 ) and fexxvi ( 1.78 ) can be fit well to a primary optically thin plasma component described by a single hot energy temperature , which we will call @xmath8 .",
    "second , the soft x - ray domain x - ray continuum suffers photoelectric absorption , which can be modeled by the equivalent of a hydrogen column density ( hereafter @xmath9 ) , which is mainly attributable to the ism as well as a local one    @xmath10 along the sight line to the hot plasma component .",
    "in addition , a number of emission lines in the soft x - ray waveband indicate the presence of additional cooler optically thin plasma components . if the spectral coverage is limited only to the hard x - ray region the continuum alone , one can determine a reasonably accurate value of @xmath8  but not necessarily also model the absorption column density .",
    "this is particularly true if one does not anticipate the possibility of multiple absorption columns . in such cases both",
    "the determination of @xmath8 and the description of the column absorptions can be badly compromised ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  s04  ) .    given these properties ,",
    "@xmath0cas has become a compelling mystery object with more than enough surprises to attract considerable interest within the stellar x - ray community @xcite . in the intervening time",
    "only some of the answers we now have as to how and where the hard x - rays are created can be attributed to the latest generation of x - ray satellites .",
    "rather , crucial new information has come with temporal correlations of contemporaneous x - ray , optical , and uv data .",
    "apart from its x - ray emission , @xmath0cas  appears to be a typical b0.5ive star .",
    "its luminosity class iv is consistent with its being a field main sequence b star and having an age of @xmath111520 myr .",
    "herein we will assume that @xmath0cas  has a mass near @xmath12 , a revised hipparcos distance of 168pc @xcite , a radius of @xmath13 , and an effective temperature @xmath14 = 28kk .",
    "with these parameters the uniform stellar disk diameter on the sky corresponds to 0.44 milliarcseconds @xcite .",
    "robotic observations with the 16-inch  t3 \" automated photometric telescope ( apt ) using the johnson @xmath15 and @xmath16 filters consistently for more than 15 years indicate the presence of a robust signature with a period of 1.215811@xmath17 days ( * ? ? ?",

    "the emission has been present for most all of its nearly 150 year observed history .",
    "a chronicle of the variations during the early and mid-20th century has been given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors noted that the star s h@xmath5 emission has not always been detectable , and in fact it disappeared during 19421946 after a brief period of  spectacular variations \" ( sv ) .",
    "although many astronomers believe these variations are due to internal instabilities rising to the be star s surface , @xcite has attributed them to the precession of the be disk that is tilted with respect to the star s equatorial plane .",
    "however for such an explanation to hold , the orientation of the disk would have to change , and thus depart from the rotational plane , at the start and end of the sv era .",
    "the observational techniques needed to determine disk coplanarity were not developed at that time .    in recent history",
    "this emission has been more or less slowly building since a sudden outburst in 1969 .",
    "documentations of the h@xmath5 emission have been carried out , albeit with heterogeneous instruments since 1991 , and with a single stable low - resolution spectrographic - ccd system since late 1994 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  s12  ) .",
    "these observations showed the existence of a quasi - periodicity of the violet / red emission ratio extending over the last three decades of the 20th century , but this cyclicity had disappeared by 2000 .",
    "@xcite have published a self - consistent model for the @xmath0cas  disk that assumes both radiative - equilibrium and an axisymmetric geometry .",
    "these authors found a volume density at the equatorial disk base of 35@xmath2010@xmath21 g@xmath22 , similar to earlier results by @xcite .",
    "the latter paper gives a vertical column density at the base of 0.2 g@xmath23 ( 10@xmath24 atoms@xmath23 ) .",
    "the circumstellar disk of @xmath0cashas been resolved by a number of lboi studies .",
    "the best models for the visibility functions are consistent with the geometry of an ellipsoid with a gaussian drop - off in density .",
    "in addition to lboi observations centered on the h@xmath5 line , observations have been carried out across various continuum bands , including @xmath16 ,  near h@xmath5 , \" and infrared @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands ( 1.85@xmath27 m and 2.1@xmath27 m , respectively ) .",
    "brief histories of lboi studies of this star / disk system can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these studies give important constraints on the structure of the inner disk of @xmath0cas ,   including its opening angle and density drop - off with radius .",
    "these results also demonstrate that the spatial extent of @xmath0cas s disk in the sky increases at long wavelengths .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation that infrared continuum radiation of the disk is dominated by bound - free emission and thus become more optically thick at these wavelengths .",
    "@xcite used time - resolved lboi in h@xmath5 to track prograde precession of a one - arm density wave embedded in the disk .",
    "in addition , lboi observations attached to a high dispersion spectrograph have shown that the disk obeys a keplerian rotation law around the be star out to the outer limits of its detectability @xcite .",
    "note , however , that these data do not constrain the rotation rate of the inner disk , that is to within about one stellar radius of the surface of the be star .",
    "the radial velocity curve for the @xmath0cas  binary system has been determined from monitoring the wavelengths of selected points on the h@xmath5 profile .",
    "subtle changes in this profile can produce errors in the shape of the rv curve , making it challenging to measure the star",
    "s radial velocity accurately .",
    "nonetheless , it is now clear that the system has an orbital period of 203.55@xmath28 day , a full velocity amplitude 2k = 7kms@xmath4 , an eccentricity of @xmath290.03 , and a secondary mass near @xmath30 @xcite . given these parameters the orbital separation of the two stellar components is 36.5r@xmath31 and the roche lobe of the be star is 21.4r@xmath31 , i.e. , well beyond the observable outer edge of the circumstellar disk .",
    "it is also thought that the outer disk edge is truncated by 3:1 period resonances with the secondary star @xcite .",
    "the practical effect of this is not to create a sudden cut - off at this radius but rather to greatly steepen the density distribution beyond this point @xcite . from this consideration",
    "the accretion of matter will be at least somewhat diminished , thereby arguing against an explanation involving x - ray emission from an accreting degenerate companion ..",
    "we begin our detailed description of the phenomenological properties of the x - ray emitting plasmas , by discussing the analysis of high resolution spectroscopic data .      prior to the launches of _",
    "tenma , _ _ ginga , _ and _ bepposax _ during the period 19831996 , various studies had lacked the energy coverage and resolution to differentiate a thermal from a power law model in the @xmath0cas   energy spectrum .",
    "these instruments as well as _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ that followed them in 1999 showed the dominant plasma component has an energy temperature @xmath8 @xmath1 1214kev ( i.e. , 1.41.6@xmath2010@xmath32k ) .",
    "significantly , ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  m86  ) discovered the presence of the fexxv and fexxvi lines in the x - ray spectrum , which although they are blended is important because they strongly suggest the spectrum is thermal and optically thin , and therefore that it is not formed by accretion onto a ns .",
    "the first high resolution spectrum of @xmath0cas  was obtained in august 2001 , through the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( s04 ) .",
    "this spectrum covered the wavelength range 1.625  and immediately revealed surprises .",
    "foremost among them was its steep gradient with wavelength .",
    "this was due only partly to the already high expected energy temperature of the dominant plasma .",
    "the remaining cause of this steep slope was the intervening high local column density that was present at this time .",
    "the low photon count rate near the short wavelength edge and the absorption column rendered an accurate determination of the temperature uncertain , so a value of 12.3kev was adopted from an earlier analysis of the _ bepposax _ spectrum @xcite .",
    "however additional optically thin thermal components were needed in the modeling to explain the presence of lyman@xmath5 emission lines arising from even - z intermediate elements .",
    "in particular , towards longer wavelengths it became necessary to add plasma components of lower temperatures . in all s04 found that four components were required for a spectrum obtained in 2001 , as s12 also found for spectrum obtained in 2010 .",
    "had a slight preference for three components for a spectrum taken in 2004 .",
    "the hot component , with @xmath8@xmath112.3kev , was found to be responsible for 8088% of the x - ray flux in the 0.210kev energy band.1kev , respectively . throughout this review we use these terms for these energy ranges , as well as @xmath33 @xmath347kev for  hot . \" ] recent _ xmm / epic _ ( european photon imaging camera ) spectra , which provide moderate resolution coverage for wavelengths 141 , have pointed to similar @xmath8 values , in particular 13.515.7kev for four observations distributed over 40 days in 2010 ( s12 ) . however , it is not clear that the plasma temperature is changed over this short timescale because @xcite found a similar range of values , @xmath8 = 12.414.3kev , for a single _ xmm _ observation made in 2004 , though modeled with different analysis software . in all , while there may be some variation of the temperature of the primary plasma component , its documented variation is no larger than 2kev .",
    "additional _ xmm _ spectra of @xmath0cas  were obtained in february 2004 ( l10 ) and july  august , 2010 ( s12 ) .",
    "importantly , these observations were not just made through the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) @xmath35 system ( and in the latter case also the mos1/mos2 camera ) .",
    "the two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1/rgs2 ) , which cover emission over 6.238  at high resolution .",
    "also , the long - wavelength limit of the rgs system allows generous coverage of the soft x - ray regime .",
    "this means a better modeling of photoelectric absorption columns than _ chandra / hteg _ as well as the inclusion of emission lines arising from hydrogenic cno ions as well as so - called _  rif \" _ triplets discussed in @xmath36[rifdns ] .",
    "these studies also showed a preference for three , or more probably four , optically thin plasma components .",
    "s12 also found that a continuous differential emission measure ( dem ) model gave a poorer fit to the data , meaning that the spectrum could indeed be best fit with plasmas having 34 discrete plasmas having different temperatures  not a single broad distribution of temperatures .",
    "similar to earlier colorimetric monitoring studies using the _ rossi x - ray time explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite by ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  src98  ) and ( * ? ? ? *  rs00  ) , the temperature of the dominant ( hot ) plasma from @xmath0cas exhibits little epoch - to - epoch variation . of the components found for a four component model , the third ( having @xmath37 = 2.54kev ) usually has the smallest emission measure .",
    "even so , its presence is essential for the formation of fel shell and other lines .",
    "s12 found that the temperatures and emission measures of the second and third ( `` warm '' ) components may well be variable on timescales of weeks .",
    "there is contradictory evidence of whether thermal components alone are altogether sufficient to describe the x - ray spectrum of `` @xmath0cas  stars . '' in their recent study of @xmath0cas , @xcite , combined _ suzaku _ and _ integral _ data .",
    "this extended the energy range under study to 100kev .",

    "the shrader et al .",
    "fit to the continuum is shown in figure1 and supports this conclusion .",
    "however , in their studies of high resolution spectra of @xmath0cas ,   s04 , l10 , and s12 found the presence of relatively strong ly@xmath38 , nex and oviii lines in the spectrum of @xmath0cas  to be incompatible with a thermal model that fit the fexxv / fexxvi lines and surrounding continuum . at the high energy end of the spectrum the hinted existence of a relatively strong fexxvi ly@xmath38 line in the spectrum of the first known and brightest @xmath0cas  analog hd110432 was first noted on by @xcite and discussed further by ( *",

    "this value is roughly consistent with wind - shock plasma temperatures of other early b - type stars .",
    "however , the volume emission measure is a few times larger than shocks caused by b star winds ( s04 , l07b )",
    ". this fact casts some doubt that we are observing the canonical b - star wind in this spectrum .",
    "subsequent analyses by l10 and s12 of more recent _ xmm _ soft x - ray spectra has reinforced this doubt , for example because of their non - negative radial velocities and the short - term variations of only the soft x - ray flux .",
    "there is some ambiguity here because of the fact that the wind density varies as a function of latitude among be stars .",
    "also , the wind density for @xmath0cas  has been known to vary with precessional phase of the disk - embedded density wave by about an order of magnitude @xcite .    in our view the question of whether the fourth plasma component is due to the star s wind is still open because we do not know whether the x - ray generation mechanism might influence the generation of winds .    to unpack the spectroscopic diagnostics revealed by each plasma component",
    ", we exhibit an  unfolded spectrum \" of @xmath0cas  as in figure2 .",
    "the component spectra are computed with the xspec modeling program for an _ xmm / rgs _ observation on august 2 , 2010 ( s12 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum is depicted by a dashed black line at the top .",
    "note that the @xmath8 component already almost matches the observed continuum spectrum , though not the line spectrum in the long wavelength range indicated .",
    "the figure clarifies how the emission line spectrum at longer wavelengths imposes the requirement that cooler plasmas be included in the overall spectrum model .",
    "[ unfld ]    from these models one point should be stressed : _ even at long wavelengths the flux of the hottest component dominates the continuum .",
    "_ then , for example , the attenuation of the soft x - ray flux is the sign of photoelectric absorption due to an intervening cold gas column along the line of sight to the hot site(s ) situated in background .",
    "one of the fortuitous aspects of the modeling of these @xmath0cas  data is the recognition that the broad range of continuum wavelengths allows one to determine that two separate absorption columns to the x - ray sources are required .",
    "the density for the first column , @xmath41 , alone is consistent with the uv - derived ism column .",
    "thus , it is assumed to be nonlocal and unrelated to processes prevailing near the be star .",
    "the additional column , @xmath10 , affects only the hot plasma component , at least so far as current quality x - ray spectra allow us to know .",
    "it exceeds the ism value typically by a large , time - variable factor ( 2740@xmath20 ) , but it covers only one quarter of the hot plasma site(s ) , a fraction that s04 expected based on the assumption that the emission sites are distributed randomly across and close to the be star s surface and also on the inclination of @xmath0cas  to our line of sight ; @xmath42 is the ratio of the visible areas in the star s  northern \" and  southern \" hemispheres .",
    "the upper part of figure3 depicts for @xmath0cas  the effects of attenuation on the soft x - ray region due to the ism ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath10 columns ( i.e. , as observed ) , and also flux corrected as if only the @xmath10 column were present .",
    "additionally , it shows the correction to the flux as if neither column were present .",
    "the lower part of the figure highlights the effect for the @xmath0cas   analog hd110432 with the single absorption column , @xmath41 , present ( as observed ) and also corrected for the effects of this absorption .",
    "thus , the highest two flux spectra in this figure ( spectra _ b _ and _ e _ ) represent what the spectra would look like without any intervening absorption .",
    "[ gchd ]      the density - sensitive _ rif _ ( resonance / intercombinational / forbidden ) triplet lines are widely used in x - ray spectroscopy to estimate the volumetric density of a hot emitting plasma . for the @xmath0cas spectrum",
    "the absence of the forbidden component and the near equality of the _ r _ and _ i _ line components arising from he - like ions sixiii and neix could itself indicate a high density ( @xmath710@xmath43@xmath22 ) for the  warm \" plasma components .",
    "however , the implied dominance of collisions setting these ratios could just as easily be caused by quenching due to collisional deexcitation due to far - uv radiation from the nearby be star .",
    "therefore , the triplets turn out not to be decisive indicators of the local plasma densities . nonetheless , s12 pointed out that the observed ratios of certain l - shell fe ion lines is consistent with even higher densities ( 10@xmath4410@xmath45@xmath22 ) for the  warm \" components , according to the models of @xcite .",
    "the typical density of the @xmath8 plasma is at least this high ( see @xmath36[xrfl ] ) .",
    "a surprise from these analyses was that the strengths of several important spectral lines and their possible correlations with the @xmath10 column are evident over time .",
    "of particular note , varying line strengths are those for which fe , ne , and n abundances are derived , and these often lead to nonsolar abundances .",

    "after @xcite.,width=245 ]      several attributes of the resolved flares have been determined for @xmath0cas  and hd110432 .",
    "first , in a statistical analysis of a number of short - lived flares with high - quality _ rxte _ light curves , src98 found that their profiles are symmetrical , suggesting that their decay times are shorter than the detectable fwhm lifetime limit of 4s .",

    "this is true for flares observed in hd110432 . on the other hand ,",
    "slm12 point out that a power law distribution could _ appear _ log - linear if the range of flare energies sampled is truncated by instrumental constraints , as is the case for our sources .",
    "third , the upper limit to resolved flare lifetimes is about 150s for @xmath0cas  and about 100s for hd110432 .",
    "most flare lifetimes lie well within low and high limits , namely 1030s .",
    "mean flare lifetimes and energies can be different at different times ( slm12 ) .",
    "fourth , a comparison of the flare rates of @xmath0cas  and hd110432 - using both _",
    "rxte / pca _ and _ xmm _ data showed that once account is taken of hd110432 being 11 times fainter in the 0.212kev x - ray band than @xmath0cas ,   the flare rates of the two stars are equal to well within measurement errors ( slm12 ) .",
    "this rate is 0.0090.012 flaress@xmath4 . according to studies of flare rates at different epochs ,",
    "the variance within this range is caused mainly by actual changes in the flare rate with time .",
    "fifth , slm12 studied the interval of time between successive flares and found the distribution was consistent with their occurring randomly .",
    "statistically , x - ray colors of flares are typically rather close to colors of neighboring basal flux . for @xmath0cas  and hd110432 small inequalities of colors do sometimes occur and with either sign .",
    "generally , the @xmath0cas   flares tend to be systematically softer or harder than the basal flux for hours or more at a time ( rs00 ) .",
    "however , it is occasionally the case , particularly for hd110432 , that flare to basal colors can reverse in even several minutes , according to slm12 .",
    "these authors found that 75% of the time the flare strengths are comparable in soft and hard x - ray bands . for 1520% of events in their study soft x - ray flares were stronger than their hard counterparts , while in the remaining 5 - 10% of the cases the reverse was true .",
    "these studies demonstrate in the main that the flare - producing energy reservoirs are fairly constant in terms of their mean injected energy , though they can at times vary dramatically .      since we know a great deal about the release of x - rays from magnetic activity on the sun , it is worthwhile comparing the phenomenology of solar flares with what we observe in the rapid x - ray events in @xmath0cas .",
    "actually , a comparison of true solar flares with flare - like events in the light curves of @xmath0cas  and hd110432 show more differences than similarities .",
    "an energetic flare on @xmath0cas  can be up to 10@xmath3 ergs@xmath4 , which is orders of magnitude more than an energetic solar flare ( although in rare cases solar flares have been observed releasing this energy ) .",

    "even so , studies of @xmath0cas  flaring distributions over time indicate that their slopes vary , and this is not a data sampling artifact . nor",
    "is it a characteristic of typical solar flare distributions .",
    "another difference with flares in small active regions on the sun is that flares in @xmath0cas  are typically well spaced in time from one another ( * ? ? ?",

    "they do not occur as on the sun and active cool stars in clusters or cascades @xcite .",

    "in contrast , flares on @xmath0cas   and hd110432 give every indication of being triggered independently of one another ( slm12 ) .",
    "this seems to be a fundamental difference from true flares on the sun and related active cool stars . also , src98 pointed out that the presence of flares is correlated with the introduction of matter ( co - rotating clouds ) over areas over the surface .",
    "+      in the first statistical analysis of flare properties of @xmath0cas ,   src98 found a strong correlation between the flare ( upper ) and basal ( background ) flux envelopes as the x - ray light curvesk varied over timescales of an hour or longer .",
    "this result , the observation that the basal and flare colors are usually almost indistinguishable from one another , all combined with the argument that the creation of basal flux _ results _ from the flares imply that the flare energy decays adiabatically ( src98 ) .",
    "that is , the flare duration is essentially set by the flare parcel expansion time and not the cooling timescale .",
    "applying these inferences , and the fact that the x - ray emission is optically thin , src98 showed that the exploding flare parcels are typically small ( radius @xmath475000 km ) . also , _ they arise in plasma densities of @xmath710@xmath45 @xmath22 .",
    "_ this last conclusion arises mainly from the observed lifetimes of the most short - lived flares and is therefore venue - independent : the density and volume estimates derived for the hot plasma sites pertain to whatever the physical mechanism for x - ray generation .",
    "this argument reinforces , though is much stronger than , results from spectroscopic diagnostics of density discussed in @xmath36[rifdns ] .",
    "+      src98 investigated the creation of basal x - ray flux for @xmath0cas   as a follow - up to their examination of plasma cooling properties of x - ray flares .",
    "they found that after an initial injection of high energy , gas parcels with typical sizes of a few thousand kilometers , expand explosively on a timescale of 5s .",
    "typically some 4% of their energy is lost during this adiabatic phase .",
    "eventually radiative cooling dominates the expansion , but only after further expansion is halted by overpressure from an external mechanism . in view of the presumed role of magnetic fields in enforcing corotation of uv - observed clouds , src98 attributed the confinement to the anchoring of field line loops emanating from the be star s surface .    during the post - flare cooling stage",
    "one should expect to detect emission from a continuum of temperatures if the gas expansion continues unabated .",
    "l10 and s12 tested the idea of _ in situ _ cooling by searching for the presence of a dem , that is by plasma emission over a continuous range of temperatures instead of one or more discrete ones .",
    "their work showed that the dem description did not result in a model that gave an acceptable fit to the x - ray emission line spectrum and thus argued against a continuous and unconstrained plasma cooling .    in their discussion of the generation of basal flux",
    ", src98 adopted a characteristic volumetric density of 10@xmath43@xmath22 based on the timescale of changes in the basal flux and also the frequency where the power spectrum tends to departs from a linear @xmath53 relation ( figure5 ) . using this value and using flare - canopy plasma models developed for solar flare regions , these authors found that an individual flare expands into a canopy with projected area of @xmath470.002 of the star s and a height of @xmath470.05r@xmath31 above the star s surface .",
    "these numbers are self - consistent in the sense that they predict the generation of the observed x - ray emission measure of @xmath473@xmath2010@xmath58 @xmath22 .",
    "they also assume that at any moment we observe a total of 1020 flare and basal emitting regions . src98",
    "estimated the mean magnetic fields within these confined regions to be @xmath47200gauss .",
    "we stress that these estimates ultimately hinge on the assumption that the immediate post - flare expansion is abruptly braked within a magnetically confined volume .",
    "the result is that the basal and flare temperatures are about equal . in @xmath36[msddesc ] we will discuss initial conditions that might lead to the creation of surface flares .",
    "the least understood of the x - ray emitting components in @xmath0cas  and hd110432 are the one or two so - called warm plasmas ( defined again with @xmath8@xmath12.56kev ) .",
    "this is because these components are visible mainly through their line spectra ; their continuum emission can be interpreted only roughly through an x - ray colors defined across short and long wavelength subdomains .",
    "a few studies @xcite comparing rapid time series behavior between soft and hard x - ray light curves indicate that they often do not coincide , and this has been taken as evidence that the warm plasmas are not cospatial with the hard x - ray sites . as noted in @xmath36[rifdns ] , the _ rif _ ratios arising from he - like ions do not advance the issue .",
    "the observation of certain fel lines noted in the same previous discussion could lead to densities as low as 10@xmath44 @xmath22 .",
    "this is consistent with the base density of the disk .",
    "another interesting diagnostic is the local turbulent velocity measured from the ( symmetric ) lines arising from the warm plasma .",
    "this broadening is of the order of 500kms@xmath4 @xcite , although in one case , possibly an outlier , a value as high as 950kms@xmath4 was reported .",
    "the salient point here is that velocities derived from warm plasma lines are inconsistent with the higher values of thermal broadening of the hot plasma ( @xmath71500kms@xmath4 ; src98 ) .",
    "in addition , in their _ hst / ghrs _ time series spectra sr99 found no correlation between the presence of hot plasma lines of fev shifted by the same velocities at which siiii 1417   ( a warm plasma line ) features were found .",
    "these discoveries validate the conclusion from the x - ray color curves noted just above that the warm plasmas are in emitted in another place  even if the their formations are associated ( that is , generally correlated ) with one another .",
    "s04 speculated that the warm plasma could be created either by collisions of hot plasma , or perhaps by an initial accelerated electron beam , into disk material or as an attribute of the slowing of the plasma cooling as the losses move through plateauing cooling curves due to certain dominant metallic ions in the plasma .",
    "however , the improved accuracy of the component determinations in the @xcite study also indicates the absence of plasma emission between the emitting components .",
    "this suggests to us by now that the continuously cooling scenario is a less likely explanation .    as for the companion cool ( @xmath59 ) plasma component , in addition to the arguments mentioned in @xmath36[dscvr ] one should emphasize the fact that this component shows lines leading to solar ( at least for [ c ] ) abundances indicates that the soft spectrum is formed in an optically thin plasma .",
    "in general , it must be said that the location of the warm and cool plasmas and their role in local energetics near the be star are not yet understood .",
    "the high throughput of the envisaged athena x - ray satellite , and in particular the high spectral resolution capabilities of its planned x - ifu instrument , will allow exquisite time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "line ratios , profiles and velocities will provide key diagnostics on the location and properties of the hot , warm and soft thin thermal emitting regions .",
    "in addition , future observations with a larger aperture x - ray telescope can tell us whether the emission lines emitted by the warm plasma are attenuated or not by the n@xmath60 column , which so far is defined mainly for the hot plasma sites in the @xmath0cas  spectrum .",
    "if n@xmath60 affects the warm sites too they are probably be located near the hot sites , even if they are not cospatial with them .      using the then novel capabilities of the _ rxte / pca _ and _ asca _ detectors , src98 and ( * ? ? ?",

    "analyzing 15 years of simultaneous _ asm / rxte _ x - ray data and @xmath16 band apt observations , mls15 found that on many occasions the regularly sampled x - ray and optical light curves were very well correlated on time scales of several months ( see their fig .",

    "the @xmath0cas  case is particularly edifying , once again , because the changes in the soft x - ray spectrum can be modeled by variations of more than 300@xmath20 in the local @xmath10 absorption column for @xmath42 of the x - ray site(s ) . according to slm12",

    "in the latter case they assumed their short lifetimes arise from cooling in a high density medium .",
    "the permitted region in the flare - emitting blob s radius is consistent with a wd s radius , and this was used in support of the wd accretion hypothesis .",
    "the problem with the latter argument is that it is a necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "many individual flares may occur over an extended surface area , but this does not mean they are generated one at a time over the same contiguous surface , e.g. , of a wd . to the contrary , one can argue that the occasional confluence of flares , including individual flares having different colors , indicates it is likely that they are distributed over a projected area larger than a wd .",
    "k98 amplified the wd argument from analysis of moderate dispersion _ asca _ spectra of @xmath0cas .",
    "their results confirmed that the x - ray light curve typically contains ubiquitous short - lived flares while its spectrum is hard and contains the fexxv and fexxvi emission lines .",
    "moreover , these authors took the absence of x - ray pulses to indicate that any existing wd can not be strongly magnetic .",
    "k98 noted dissimilarities of the x - ray spectrum of @xmath0cas   with x - ray coronae in late - type active or t tauri stars , which exhibit a continuum and emission line pattern consistent only with cooler plasma .",
    "they also contended against the contemporary src98 picture as they understood it and argued further against any  coronal \" model .",
    "however , src98 had not argued for a coronal model because they emphasized the x - ray flux is generated in a much denser medium .",
    "in addition , k98 argued that src98 did not consider that the light curves of dwarf nova binaries such as sscyg could in principle also exhibit an uv / x - ray anticorrelation such as that found in figure6 .",
    "however , sscyg is actually a close low - mass binary ( @xmath88 = 6.6 hours ) , consisting of a roche lobe - overflowing k5v star and a wd that hosts an accretion disk .",
    "the system undergoes irregular uv / euv outbursts lasting on the order of a week .",
    "typically , just before an euv outburst the x - ray flux decreases and its hardness changes as well .",
    "an analogous mid - uv outburst occurs shortly thereafter .",
    "thus , importantly , the changes in these bands do not occur simultaneously .",
    "in fact , the asynchrony of changes across the energy range is explained well by the accretion disk dissipation model for dwarf novae .",
    "according to this model when an outburst begins , an instability results from the accumulation of matter at the outer edge of the accretion disk and migrates to its inner edge .",
    "this causes sequential brightening in one waveband after another .",
    "none of these properties is shared by the synchronous anti - correlation exhibited in figure6 and figure9 .",
    "k98 also argued that because flares can be excited on some active wds , their existence on @xmath0cas  does not exclude a be - wd accretion scenario .",
    "the best example of wds with flares in their light curves , so - called  intermediate polars . \" intermediate polars are binary systems consisting of an evolutionarily - driven , expanding main sequence star and a magnetic wd .",
    "mass from the primary is transferred by angular momentum conservation to an accreting disk around the wd .",
    "matter is then guided by magnetic fields to an accretion column at the disk - star interface . initially falling into this column as blobs ,",
    "these structures are stretched vertically by tidal forces .",
    "they shock and emit high energy radiation when they eventually brake at high densities , emitting flares .",
    "flares are observed primarily only at certain orbital phases .",
    "studies by @xcite and @xcite have found that x - ray colors of flares can be quite different among various polars .",
    "they attribute this difference to the characteristic blob size of a particular polar . in the case of amher small blobs shock near the top of the accretion column , where they can be observed by an external observer as moderately hard ( @xmath473kev ) individual flares . in other cases , such as v1309ori , the blobs are larger and their infalls survive the fall through most of the column to the wd s surface .",
    "the overlying column absorbs the emitted x - ray flux , and all that is observed , if visible at all , are aggregates of unresolved soft x - ray events .",
    "( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "however , notice the near equality of the colors of most basal and flare fluxes in @xmath0cas  and hd110432 is in direct contrast to the diversity of flare colors observed among polars .",
    "in addition , the observation of ubiquitous flaring in the @xmath0cas  stars light curves is in disagreement with the observed phase - dependent events in polar light curves . in summary , the flare characteristics of @xmath0cas  are not a good fit to the characteristics of polars .",
    "@xcite discovered that be - ns binaries follow a strong correlation between rotational and orbital periods , where the latter were determined from their x - ray pulse rates .",
    "they also showed that this correlation can be predicted by orbiting particles around a strongly magnetized neutron star being balanced between centrifugal and magnetic forces at points where the corotation and alfvn radii are equal .",
    "the determination of periods for additional be - ns systems over the years has confirmed mason & corbet s results , and thus the so - called corbet relation has been a useful tool in predicting one period or the other when only one is known . building on this result ,",
    "@xcite has applied the corbet relation for be x - ray binaries with shorter pulse periods .",
    "his reasoning was that shorter pulse periods might be expected for be - wd systems because of the larger radii and weaker field strengths of white dwarfs .",
    "apparao found that two binaries in his sample fell on a line in the p@xmath89p@xmath90 plane well to the left ( towards shorter orbital periods ) where most be - ns systems reside .",
    "he argued that the shorter orbital periods occur because the degenerate secondary stars have weaker fields than ns do , and he took these as possible be - wd binaries .",
    "@xcite found next that the 204day orbital and @xmath471 day _ rotational _ periods of @xmath0cas  fall close to the putative be - wd relation and therefore that systems falling along it can be considered candidate be - magnetic wd systems . in assessing this hypothesis , one can point out that no evidence has since been uncovered to confirm that apparao s sample of two are in fact be - wd systems .",
    "indeed , in the intervening years no be - wd systems have been found that emit hard x - rays . also , in a review of the status of the corbet relation @xcite find a similar subpopulation to apparao s .",
    "however , they judge it to be secondary population of be - ns , not be - wd , systems .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again that recent evidence demonstrates that robust ",
    "pulses \" are not present in the x - ray light curves of @xmath0cas  or its analogs .      according to the theoretical models of @xcite , @xmath4770% of all",
    "be stars could be formed during late stages of binary evolution as a result of angular momentum - rich material migrating through the roche lobe , accreting to and spinning up the surface layers of the be star .",
    "if so the typical secondaries are white dwarfs with @xmath14 @xmath4740kk .",
    "the fact that such secondaries are so much fainter than b stars , even in the uv , is one reason for the general failure to find such systems .",
    "if so , one asks : what would they look like in the x - ray domain ?",
    "might be - wd systems be , for example , a subclass of so - called super - soft x - ray sources ( sss ) ? could these be related to or confused with @xmath0cas  stars ?",
    "sss are thought to represent a broad class of very soft x - ray emitters that are detected at energies only below 1kev @xcite .",
    "they occur mainly in binaries , including subclasses of novae and polars , but they can be found also among evolved single stars ( nuclei of planetary nebulae and cooling ns ) . under the right conditions nuclear burning occurs when matter from an evolving primary falls and accumulates onto the wd surface .",
    "upon thermalization of the released potential energy a  super - soft \" ( @xmath39 t @xmath91 100ev ) black body spectrum - like is emitted .",
    "the x - ray flux is strongly attenuated by a dense accretion disk around the wd .",
    "although this makes it difficult to determine the intrinsic l@xmath87 of the source accurately , typical estimates lie in the range of 10@xmath9210@xmath93ergss@xmath4 .",
    "recently survey work has uncovered one sss associated with an early - type star in each of the magellanic clouds , detailed as follows .",
    "@xcite discovered the source xmmuj052016.0 - 692505 in the _ xmm / epic _ public archive and identified its optical counterpart as the large magellanic cloud star lmcv2135 .",
    "optical spectroscopy revealed that this to be an early be giant star that hosts an extensive disk .",
    "moreover , uv filter magnitudes from the _ xmm _ optical monitor are consistent with a photometic spectral type of a b0-b3iii star and a mass near @xmath94 . at the time of this discovery",
    "a be star with a super - soft x - ray spectrum was a novelty .",
    "thus , they concluded that this sss be system is unique and that its x - rays resulted from thermal runaway of matter steadily accreted onto the surface of a wd .",
    "if so , it has become the first known be - wd system .",
    "the authors bolstered their argument by showing that the evolutionary - determined ages and the masses estimated for the binary components are consistent with evolutionary scenarios predicted by @xcite models for high mass binaries . in sum , these authors argued that sss objects are a logical channel for be stars that have been spun up by binary mass transfer . indeed",
    "the spinning up of be stars in close binaries appears to be a common occurrence , according to a study of be stars observed in open clusters @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite conducted a survey for sss in the small magellanic cloud and discovered the sss object xmmuj010147.5 - 715550 and determined its optical counterpart to be azv281 , an o7iiie  b0ie star . using arguments similar to those of @xcite , they concluded that this is another be - wd system .",
    "in addition , x - ray monitoring of the object disclosed the unique circumstance that its soft band ( 0.2 - 1.0kev ) flux decreased by a factor of @xmath740@xmath20 in roughly a year .",
    "neither of these authors suggested a connection between @xmath0cas  and sss objects .",
    "indeed @xcite drew a contrast between the two on the basis of the very softness of sss star spectra .",
    "in addition , the principal sculpting agent of x - ray spectra of sss be star binaries is the dense accretion disk surrounding the secondary star ; there is no apparent role for the decretion disk of the be star .",
    "altogether , there is scant if any evidence for a connection between the two groups of objects .    to conclude this section ,",
    "the ns accretion hypothesis has lost its early luster in favor of the still - surviving wd one .",
    "the surviving appeal of the wd picture lies in the similarity of its spectrum to certain types of active white dwarfs ( especially intermediate polars ) and the absence of pulses in either @xmath0cas  itself or its analogs .",
    "a lingering problem with the wd accretion scenario , as noted by @xcite , has been the question of whether the powering of the observed l@xmath87 @xmath4710@xmath3 ergss@xmath4 can be accomplished from matter accreted from a wd in a @xmath0cas - like orbit .",
    "estimates in the recent x - ray binary literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest a range of 10@xmath9510@xmath3 ergss@xmath4 .",
    "the upper limit to this range assumes rapid expulsion of matter in the plane of the disk by a discrete ejection - since it must be orders of magnitude above a wind mass loss rate .",
    "part of the issue has been the uncertainty of the outflow velocity that discrete ejections have .",
    "this is important because the mass loss and hence putative accretion - powered l@xmath87 increases as 1/@xmath96@xmath97 , according to the bondi - hoyle accretion formalism .",
    "probably a more relevant question is how efficiently the outer edge of the disk of a @xmath0cas  star is truncated by the tidal interactions with a binary companion ( see @xmath36[binry ] ) and whether discrete mass ejections can cross such a barrier rapidly enough before dispersing to the ism or returning to the be star .",
    "although this issue is not yet decisively resolved , so far the evidence does not favor rapid crossings , if such crossings occur at all ( e.g. , mls15 ) .",
    "in any case , the optical variations resulting from a strong be outburst are seldom events .",
    "they do not occur in a continuously - repeating or sustained manner , e.g. , @xcite , such as would be required to power the full observed x - ray luminosity of @xmath0cas .",
    "much of the advocacy for the picture of accretion onto a degenerate companion has been made by attempting to tie the @xmath0cas  case to other classes of x - ray be binary systems for which the accretion model has been so successfully applied . in this section",
    "we argue that overall this is insufficient because the @xmath0cas  stars comprise a unique class , one which associates x - ray properties to the immediate environment of the be star rather than to a binary companion . with this as context , we introduce the so - called magnetic star - disk interaction picture .",
    "we preface our discussion by pointing out that this is a hypothesis built on the empirical data alone .",
    "it is supported by a few conjectures , as we will see , and it is not yet capable of making predictions .",
    "the original hypothesis drew its support from correlations of properties of x - ray and uv / optical diagnostics . the first multi - wavelength correlated event was an x - ray flare in the _ copernicus _ light curve of @xmath0cas   reported to @xcite in 1978 .",
    "this coincided with short - lived emissions in the uv resonance lines of mgii and siiv and also an h@xmath5 emisson  flare \" @xcite .",
    "however , this was a single event .",
    "the best contnuing array of events was the simultaneous uv / x - ray campaign in 1996 .",
    "the x - ray / uv correlations reproduced in figures68 suggested a picture of short - lived corotating cloud complexes ejected from active sites on the be star ( see @xmath36[hdbas ] ) .",
    "next , the discovery that the 5091 day cycles are present in both the optical and x - ray region ( figure10 ) , together with their amplitudes being about larger in the red than the blue , suggested that the cycles originate in the cool be decretion disk ( rsh02 ) .",
    "as noted , mls15 showed that this initial finding can be broadened to demonstrate that optical and x - ray variations of even a year or longer are well correlated , with zero delay and with the same scaling factor applying to this broadened range .",
    "importantly , the zero delay is at variance with the several year delay expected in the accretion scenario between the optical outburst , marking ejection of matter from the be star and the corresponding x - ray surge due to accretion onto the remote companion .",
    "since the optical variations are well understood to arise from the development of the inner regions of the be decretion disk , a reasonable conclusion is that the reservoir responsible for hard x - ray energy generation is associated with this structure .",
    "_ from this inference the concept of a magnetic interaction between the be star and its disk was born , a picture that is sure to evolve further with new discoveries . _    in brief , the scenario is as follows . by hypothesis , magnetic field lines",
    "extend from points on the be star s surface , at first in the form of small - scale loops .",
    "consider next that the angular rotation rate at the star s surface is greater than the keplerian rate of layers within the inner decretion disk .",
    "magnetic field lines embedded in the disk interact with the stellar field lines , at first gently .",
    "they quickly become entangled and stretched because the two fields are anchored to their respective sources .",
    "the stretching continues until eventually the lines sever and reconnect .",
    "they attempt to come to equilibrium by springing back to a lower magnetic potential and in so doing accelerate particles embedded in them ( see @xcite for a readable discussion of these processes in the solar context ) . in the @xmath0cas  environment , they are expected to be accelerated in various directions , including toward the be star and probably also the disk .",
    "figure13 depicts this action as a cartoon .",
    "[ asm ]    cas  and its decretion disk as seen from the equatorial plane .",
    "the cartoon shows the acceleration of matter following reconnection of field lines after their initial entanglement and severing .",
    "particle accelerations may be directed toward the star or the disk .",
    "after @xcite.,width=377 ]    by hypothesis the field reconnections occur as discrete events , propelling some of the particles toward the star at a few thousand kilometers per second .",
    "they impact points on the star , and thermalize there , causing the impacted gas parcels to expand explosively .",
    "we interpet these events as x - ray flares . in their analysis of flare dynamics",
    "src98 showed that the emission measures and durations of the overwhelming fraction of flares expand adiabatically , thereby maintaining their temperature during this expansion phase .",
    "note that src98 did not have to specify the source of the high energy .",
    "rs00 took the next step by following the theory of @xcite and constructing thick target bombardment simulations of electron streams having an energy temperature @xmath39 t of 200kev onto a boundary having parameters of the photosphere of a b star . with these parameters they found a braking depth of the stream that corresponds to a gas density of nearly 10@xmath45 @xmath22 and a characteristic energy temperature of @xmath39 t @xmath47 10kev .",
    "these are precisely the parameters that src98 had derived from their observations of flares for @xmath0cas .   to put some numbers into this concept , consider the case of an exemplar flare with an emission measure of 10@xmath58@xmath22 .",
    "the flare is formed in an exploding surface parcel with a radius of 5@xmath2010@xmath98 km .",
    "rs00 s high energy ( 200 kev ) electron beam would yield an energy of @xmath14@xmath2010@xmath2 ergss@xmath4 across the parcel s surface .",
    "this is sufficient to power the flare for about a second .",
    "note that this is a lower limit because it neglects the high energy tail of the electron distribution that rs00 thought might also be necessary in the real case .",
    "it also neglects the virialization of the initial energy of the input beam . additionally , the value of @xmath8 now generally agreed upon for @xmath0cas  is at least 50% higher than the value of 100mk ( 8kev ) rs00 used .",
    "thus , we know the energy numbers of rs00 are low .",
    "this work also demonstrated that an electron beam with a monoenergetic distribution leads to a flare parcel temperature slightly in excess of the temperature of a large magnetically - constrained volume that emits background ( basal ) flux .",
    "if a power law rather than a monoenergetic distribution is assumed for the injected beam , the inequality is reversed : t@xmath99 @xmath91 t@xmath100 .",
    "both inequalities have been observed , sometimes within tens of minutes of one another in the x - ray light curves of both @xmath0cas  and hd110432 ( src98 ; slm12 ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the existence of magnetically constrained volumes leading to this basal emission is suggested by the existence of corotating clouds .",
    "if particle streams are directed to the star from instabilities near the inner disk , one can seek to observe them .",
    "sr99 reported such evidence in their analysis of spectral time series of 1045 _ ghrs _ spectra in the march 1996 campaign on @xmath0cas .",
    "these moderate resolution spectra had a very high signal to noise ratio , thereby allowing analyses of variations of even weak spectral lines .",
    "the authors constructed a computer program that searched through the time series for similar responses in absorption features separated by wavelength separations corresponding to several pairs of  related \" spectral lines .",
    "related line pairs could be members of a multiplet or they might arise from two ions having similar ionization potentials .",
    "cross - correlations were carried out for fluctuations of all spectra in the time series and across a broad velocity domain .",
    "the result was a velocity - time map in which ",
    "excess \" cross - correlations could be identified and compared with correlations for fluctuations at random wavelength spacings , which served as controls .",
    "the results showed two interesting patterns .",
    "first , the excess cross - correlations occurred , with one exception , only for narrow bands centered at positive velocities .",
    "the exception was the strong correlation discovered at a range of negative velocities for the siiv resonance line doublet  this is expected for these well - known diagnostics of an outflowing hot - star wind .",
    "the second pattern was that the best cross - correlations were found at positive velocities that increased according to the excitation ion state of the lines .",
    "for example , for pairs of fev and siiv lines corresponding to a hot gas , excess correlations occurred preferentially for velocities @xmath7 + 2000kms@xmath4 while for a pair of low excitation niii and siii lines excess correlations occurred for positive velocities of only @xmath47 + 200kms@xmath4 .",
    "all told , this analysis argued that the excess correlations were real and constitute evidence of high velocity matter expelled toward the be star .",
    "moreover , velocities of @xmath342000km@xmath4 are much greater than the escape velocity at the surface of a b0.5iv star .",
    "this fact rules out an interpretation that the features arise as returning matter from an earlier failed ejection .",
    "the only reasonable scenario is that the matter had been accelerated toward the star by some intervening structure in our line of sight .",
    "the concept of a disk dynamo was suggested on the basis of the correlation between the optical and x - ray @xmath4770 day cycles . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first suggestion for a dynamo for any stellar disk . according to this idea",
    ", a dynamo is set up in any disk in which the following conditions are met : ( 1 ) a seed magnetic field is present within the disk , ( 2 ) the angular velocity of the kepler disk around the star decreases with increasing distance , and ( 3 ) no external field intrudes into the disk and disrupts its field . in such disks particle motions will be subject to a magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , in which a a positive feedback loop is set up that increases the disk seed field and gas turbulence .",
    "orbiting gas parcels respond in a dynamo cell by alternately moving inwards and outwards during a cycle ( as specific angular momentum does the opposite ) . during the phase when particles approach their innermost radius ,",
    "the gas is compressed .",
    "this increases the local emission measure , which goes as electron density squared , thereby adding to the luminosity of the star - disk complex .",
    "the upshot is that particles and field lines in the inner disk experience cycles , and as they do the instances of entanglement with stellar field lines are modulated as well .",
    "this produces cyclic variations in the numbers of accelerated particle streams and generation of flares .    in considering the conditions in which a disk dynamo might operate",
    ", a keplerian rotation law fulfills the orbital velocity - distance requirement . in practice",
    ", seed fields can be assumed to exist already ( shv06 ) .",
    "the requirement that internal disk fields are not distorted by external ones can not yet be evaluated . in evaluating the practicality of this mechanism , the overriding question is not so much whether dynamo actions exist in the disk of @xmath0cas  but rather whether the instabilities of individual cells become organized into a coherent , disk - wide dynamo .",
    "otherwise , local chaotic motions result without a clearly observable global effect .",
    "another issue is that the mechanism is _ ad hoc _ - it is constructed so far entirely from the phenomenology . however , one clear inference is that energy from magnetic stresses will be periodically exhausted in the inner disk , thereby mediating the production of accelerated particles .",
    "in addition , the picture suggests injections of streams distributed at more or less random times such that particles will be accelerated towards all possible longitudes on the be star surface . otherwise , quantitative predictions are not yet possible . in particular , the natural period of dynamo cycles is the orbital period of the inner disk , which in this case is no more than a few days , not 70 days . in sum",
    ", this hypothesis needs confirmation , including both continued theoretical and laboratory work .",
    "it is promising , but it may or may not be the correct instability underlying the observed disk variations .",
    "ultimately , it must be understood why this mechanism would work only for some be stars .",
    "one can also ask how the magnetic fields on @xmath0cas  might be generated because we know that organized low - order fields do not exist on the star s surface : if they did , their spectral uv resonance lines would show a telltale , regularly changing pattern of emission and absorption features due to clouds frozen into the stellar dipole field .",
    "recent magnetic surveys of be stars have disclosed that organized , low - order magnetic fields are not detected ( wade et al .",
    "mls16 have pointed out that of the 18 be stars for which rotational / disk obliquities are known from long baseline optical interferometry , the angular rotation rates of @xmath0cas  and hd110432 are the ones most likely to be close to their critical limits .",
    "the effects of destabilizing hydrostatic equilibrium are the greatest in the outer equatorial envelopes of such stars . in the fastest rotating stars the otherwise thin convective envelopes of these stars ( which owe their existence to large opacities from fe peak ions ) can increase dramatically @xcite .",
    "therefore , particularly in the case of differential rotation , local dynamos in the stellar envelope could develop that would spawn disorganized , nonpermanent fields  see @xcite .",
    "such fields could well elude spectropolarimetric surveys such as @xcite , even though their field lines could reach out to the inner regions of the be disk .",
    "while this last argument is speculation , we note from variations in the waveform of the 1.2-day photometric signature that the surface  patch \" corresponding to an embedded structure on the surface of @xmath0cas   has been observed to change on a timescale of two years ( hs12 ) . during the same time interval the amplitude of the photometric signature diminished by factor of 34 . the amplitudes and",
    "waveforms were constant to within errors during the few years before and after this interval .",
    "however , by the 20132014 season the 1.2 day signature was only marginally present in only one of two - filter apt light curves . by the following season",
    "it had disappeared altogether @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with a constantly - evolving , chaotic , but active field anchored not far under the star s surface , again following the cantiello & braithwaite prescription .",
    "we have no evidence as to how , or indeed whether , the @xmath0cas  stars have been  spun up . \"",
    "it may be due to a single massive star s having an especially large angular momentum , or it may be that the spin up occurs from a prior mass transfer thanks to a evolved , now passive degenerate companion .",
    "one argument favoring the latter hypothesis is that three of the @xmath0cas  analogs are probably blue stragglers ( table2 ) .",
    "could most or even all of them be blue stragglers ?",
    "this is a subject for much more research .",
    "we recapitulate this section by listing the observational underpinnings of the magnetic star - disk interaction picture .",
    "most of these have been introduced already .",
    "we summarize them in rough order of their chronology of the discovery that the star is a hard x - ray source .    1",
    ".   x - ray correlations / anticorrelations are evident in the intermediate - timescale variations of uv diagnostics .",
    "the key point is that in the be / disk / binary complex only the be star emits enough uv continuum and line fluxes for variations to be easily observed .",
    "the time coverage of the simultaneous 1996 _ rxte / hst _ observations was too long ( figs.57 ) , and both the number of up / down flux excursions and the pattern too self - consistent , to have occurred by chance .",
    "one concludes that the x - rays are created close to the be star .",
    "x - ray flares of @xmath0cas  and hd110432 must be emitted in a high density ( @xmath710@xmath45 @xmath22 ) environment .",
    "this limit is set by their short lifetimes ( @xmath36[flrprop ] ) and the ratios of spectral emission lines arising from fel - shell ions ( @xmath36[rifdns ] ) .",
    "only the photospheres of the two binary components could be the site of these flares . from the consideration of bullet 1 one",
    "is left with the be photosphere as the site of flare production .",
    "an attenuation of soft x - rays was observed that coincided precisely with the optical be outburst of @xmath0cas  in 2010 ( @xmath36[epchl ] and figure3 ) . as this outburst proceeded over the 40 days of the _ xmm _ observations , the spectra showed progressive attenuations of the soft x - ray flux , thereby requiring an increased local absorption column @xmath10 to fit the spectrum . at visible wavelengths",
    ", an optical outburst generally unfolds as a brightening and reddening of the flux from the star - disk complex .",
    "again , figure12 showed the relation between @xmath101 ) color and the determined @xmath10 column .",
    "the figure overplots the same parameters during the 2001 and 2004 x - ray observations , so we can see a common relation between these variables during different these times . because the emission of the hot primary plasma dominates at both short and long x - ray wavelengths , the column obscuring the soft x - rays also obscures hot x - ray emitting sites in the background .",
    "since the column represents an injection of matter from the be star to its circumstellar environment , this pattern indicates that the hot plasma sources are situated at the foot of the column , i.e. , just above or even at the surface of the be star .",
    "no delays are observed in integrated x - ray variability relative to optical variations of @xmath0cas .   the mls15 extension of the rsh02 and shv06 work that the scalings of correlated x - ray and optical variations over a timescale from tens of days to a year or so is important because it demonstrates that only a small ( dense inner ) region of the @xmath16-emitting decretion disk is involved in the optical / x - ray correlations .",
    "mls15 also investigated the possibility that discrete be ejections could transit across the binary system and accrete onto a degenerate companion such as a wd",
    ". however , they recognized that such ejecta would take a finite time to travel past the outer truncation and roche lobe radii before falling onto the putative wd .",
    "these authors found no delay in the x - ray variations behind the optical ones . using monte carlo techniques to noise to their _ apt _ and _ asm _ data , the authors estimated errors on this null result of one month . in contrast",
    ", they pointed out that two well known x - ray be binary systems with comparable orbital separations are _ observed _ to show a delay of a few years of x - ray responses following optical outbursts of the be primaries .",
    "on this basis , the authors argued that any x - ray generation mechanism requiring accretion onto a degenerate secondary in the orbit known for the @xmath0cas  companion is inadmissible .",
    "long - cycle variations are mediated by conditions in the inner part of the be disk .",
    "the good correlation of x - ray and optical long cycles noted by shv06 and mls15 demonstrates that the circumstellar be disk is somehow _ associated _ with x - ray generation . according to the star - disk interaction scenario , the disk provides a storage medium for pent up magnetic energy that is released at semi - periodic intervals . in this sense",
    "it represents an intermediate link in a chain of processes leading to particle acceleration and ultimately x - rays .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the study of x - ray properties of @xmath0cas  to date .",
    "work over the last several years has clarified that this star is actually the prototype of a class of peculiar x - ray emitters among those associated with massive hot stars . to the extent that observations of fainter stars can unveil them ,",
    "these studies reveal remarkably similar properties in the x - ray , uv , and optical domain .",
    "part of this review has been an evaluation of candidate mechanisms for the emission of the hard x - rays , including one in which accretion onto a degenerate companion , with its deep gravitational well , could release x - rays .",
    "the be - ns scenario , favored for a decade or more after @xcite , became disfavored following a consensus that the x - ray spectrum can be fit not by a sum of black body spectrum with an additional nonthermal ( compton ) tail but rather by the combined emission of multi - component , optically thin thermal plasmas .",
    "in particular , emission lines from the fek complex at @xmath62  and others arising from light - element ions in the soft x - ray regime are present in the spectra of @xmath0cas  stars .",
    "in addition , the x - ray light curves of be - ns systems are dominated either by strictly periodic pulses , as in highly magnetized be x - ray pulsar systems , or semi - regular outbursts tied either to the orbital period or unpredictable optical be star events .",
    "it took some additional time for a consensus ( albeit perhaps still not unanimous ) to arise that the be - wd systems can not fit the observed multi - band phenomenology .",
    "it is still the case that the efficiencies of mass transfer and thermalization must be exquisitely fine - tuned to match the x - ray luminosities of these systems , particularly with what we now understand the mass loss rates of @xmath0cas  and other classical be stars to be .",
    "furthermore , searches for be - wd systems have consistently come up either as altogether negative @xcite or as hypothetical suggestions of special cases , such as super - soft x - ray systems , that do not mimic the x - ray characteristics of @xmath0cas  stars .",
    "in addition , the simultaneous array of multi - component thermal plasmas with ubiquitous ,  gray \" flaring are attributes that are rare in active wd systems , if present at all .    the strongest arguments for the magnetic star - disk interaction picture - which is undoubtedly incomplete at some level - are corroborative , rather than exclusionary .",
    "as detailed in @xmath36[undrpn ] these arguments pertain to x - ray variations and their correlations on a wide variety of timescales with uv or optical diagnostics . here",
    "it should be understood that these diagnostics are to be expected to be formed over the surface of a @xmath47b0.5 star .    in the following",
    "we will pose the most relevant questions that can at last be asked about this class of stars .",
    "we follow with a few desiderata on what needs yet to be done .",
    "we do this with trepidation because the history of this subject has been that progress has often come from very unexpected sources .",
    "_ can we easily recognize a @xmath0cas  star ? _    in principle , yes . given that optical spectra show that an early b star is a be star neither embedded in a star - forming region or a component of an interacting binary , the work of l07a and g15 have strongly suggested that if its x - ray spectrum exhibits the full fek line complex and a nearby continuum slope that supports the energy temperatures ( i.e. , @xmath77kev ) needed to maintain the strength of these lines as well as an l@xmath87 of 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 ergss@xmath4 , the star may be reasonably advanced as a @xmath0cas  analog .",
    "these circumstances favor a wholesale discovery that has been so successful in the last few years in expanding the class , particularly thanks to cross - correlations of _ xmm / epic _ surveys with optical or even infrared catalogs .",
    "the sample as now recognized is probably complete out to a distance of @xmath472kpc , at least for the area covered by the _",
    "_ surveys .",
    "the coverage can be furthered by continued cross - correlation of hard x - ray and infrared catalogs in the galactic plane .",
    "+ _ do we have a large enough sample of @xmath0cas  stars yet to constrain the range of their x - ray characteristics ?",
    "_    from the sample of stars in table2 we now have a well defined parameter space which helps to constrain the x - ray generation mechanism resides .",
    "some areas where improvement could be required are covered by the following questions : can a late - type oe star assume the x - ray properties of @xmath0cas  stars during the much briefer times their decretion disks are maintained ? is there truly no overlap at b2 with the bp stars , where both ordered and disordered fields could exist simultaneously on a star s surface ?",
    "also , what is the lowest energy temperature an x - ray plasma hosted by in a @xmath0cas  star may have ? at the moment it appears to be about 67kev .",
    "the physical conditions setting this limit will be relevant to understanding the geometry and magnetic topology of the x - ray producing environment , possibly including the status of the be inner disk .",
    "a primary issue to resolve is the role of binarity in the setting up of the x - ray generation mechanism in @xmath0cas  stars .",
    "this question comes up first because of the known binarity of @xmath0cas  itself and second because of the likelihood that at least three analogs are old blue stragglers in galactic clusters .",
    "an answer to this question will disclose critical details about their past evolution , their current intrabinary interactions and , most especially , whether binarity is an essential element that causes the be star to spin up to criticality .",
    "thus , we recommend radial velocity monitoring in order to define the binary status of @xmath0cas  stars  the only known @xmath0cas   binary so far being @xmath0cas  itself .",
    "the questions to be asked are : what are the ranges in semimajor axes and orbital eccentricities ?    we have speculated that an early be star s rotating at near the critical velocity is important in setting up local envelope dynamos that create unstable local magnetic fields .",
    "there are three approaches to test this idea .",
    "the first is to explore the efficacy of diffusing excess angular momentum deposited on the star s surface by transfers of matter from a putative companion .",
    "this question can be addressed theoretically or by an empirical study of angular rates inside a b star determined from rotational splitting of nonradial pulsation modes .",
    "the second approach is to address the critical rotation question observationally by confirming that a near - critical rotation rate is important to the creation of the needed surface conditions for the mechanism to develop , as suggested by mls15 .",
    "improvements in lboi instrumentation ( or increases in the total integration time ) would help refine estimates in the obliquity angles of the rotation planes of some of the brighter analogs .",
    "the third approach is to survey binarity of a bright subsample of @xmath0cas  analog stars from long - term studies of their radial velocity curves .",
    "for example , a single , compelling nondetection of a nonvariable rv curve of an @xmath0cas  suspected to viewed edge - on ( from the presence of double - peaked emission profile as well as absorption  shell \" lines ) would go a long way to refuting the question of binarity .",
    "the report by @xcite that the rotational signature in the light curve of @xmath0cas  has disappeared now invites the expectation that it will return .",
    "further apt observations will tell us how long it takes to reappear , grow to full strength and indeed whether the patch responsible for it will reemerge on the surface at the same place ( longitude ) .",
    "a remaining important question is whether the presence of a stable be decretion disk , as measured by some minimum ew of h@xmath5 emission , is indeed necessary for the production of hard x - rays . over the coming period , whether it be measured in years or a few decades , astronomers should be able to monitor the h@xmath5 variability enough to catch the transition of one of the @xmath0cas  stars in table2 as it slips into a non - be phase .",
    "when this happens it will be of great interest to verify whether the x - ray emission quickly subsides and , assuming this to be so , to examine how the specific spectroscopic x - ray diagnostics change during the transition to the quiet phase .",
    "our final rhetorical question is whether a search for faint reflection and emission nebulae similar to ic59 and ic63 , which are spatially correlated with @xmath0cas  @xcite , might reveal nebulosities in the disk planes of other @xmath0cas  stars .",
    "one wonders : are such nebulosities common around @xmath0cas  stars but absent from other active be stars ?",
    "in addition , these authors suggested that a light echo could be observed in such nebulae some years after a large optical outburst of the be star ( as would be expected now after three years in the case of @xmath0cas .",
    "all these investigations are aimed at answering the key question : how does the hard x - ray emission from @xmath0cas  star form ? clearly the development of the ",
    "@xmath0cas  phenomenon \" requires the emergence of a complicated chain of processes .",
    "we have identified a number of observational disciplines and studies that are necessary for this development .",
    "they include x - ray and optical spectroscopy and photometry , long baseline optical interferometry , as well as a comparison of characteristics of @xmath0cas   analogs to accretion - related phenomena known to occur on other evolved binary systems .",
    "however , these disciplines alone are unlikely to reveal the _ linkages _ in the chain of processes that produce hard x - rays , and so new ones will be needed .",
    "foremost among them will be theoretical investigations , especially of magnetic dynamos in the envelopes and disks of be stars .",
    "these can lead to requirements for their maintenance and predictions of their durability .",

    "<S> long considered as the  odd man out \" among x - ray emitting be stars , @xmath0cas  ( b0.5eiv ) is now recognized as the prototype of a class of stars that emit hard thermal x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> our classification differs from the historical use of the term  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0cas  stars \" defined from optical properties alone . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity output of this class contributes significantly to the hard x - ray production in massive stars in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0cas  stars have light curves showing variability on a few broadly - defined timescales and spectra indicative of an optically thin plasma consisting of one or more hot thermal components . by now 913 galactic @xmath1b0 - 1.5e main sequence stars are judged to be members or candidate members of the @xmath0cas  class . </S>",
    "<S> conservative criteria for this designation are for a @xmath1b0 - 1.5e iii - v star to have an x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath210@xmath3 ergss@xmath4 , a hot thermal spectrum containing the short wavelength ly@xmath5 fexxv and fexxvi lines and the fluorescence fek feature all in emission . if thermality can not be demonstrated , for example from either the presence of these ly@xmath5 lines or curvature of the hard continuum of the spectrum of an x - ray active be star , we call them @xmath0cas  _ candidates . </S>",
    "<S> _ we discuss the history of the discovery of the complicated characteristics of the variability in the optical , uv , and x - ray domains , leading to suggestions for the physical cause of the production of hard x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> these include scenarios in which matter from the be star accretes onto a degenerate secondary star and interactions between magnetic fields on the be star and its decretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> the greatest aid to the choice of the causal mechanism is the temporal correlations of x - ray light curves and spectra with diagnostics in the optical and uv wavebands . </S>",
    "<S> we show why the magnetic star - disk interaction scenario is the most tenable explanation for the creation of hard x - rays on these stars .    </S>",
