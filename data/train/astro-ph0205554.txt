    "high resolution imaging at optical , near - infrared , and millimeter - wave wavelengths have conclusively demonstrated that circumstellar disks are ubiquitous around young solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the long - held notion that planets may frequently form in these disks has been dramatically confirmed with the increasing number of planets detected around nearby main - sequence stars @xcite . while a consensus has not yet been reached on how planets form in circumstellar disks , current theories propose that gas - giant planets form either as gravitational instabilities in an accretion disk @xcite , or from the more gradual build up of planetesimals to form a rocky core followed by accretion of gaseous material @xcite . in both class of models",
    ", the accretion disk lifetime sets an important time scale on the planet formation process by constraining the time available for a gravitational instability to develop or the rocky core to form before the gas and dust are dissipated .",
    "circumstellar accretion disks around young stars are commonly inferred based on the presence of infrared emission in excess of the stellar photosphere . in many stars the excess infrared emission from 1 - 100  can be modeled with a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk @xcite , although inner disk holes , flaring , and other refinements to this basic model are often needed to reproduce the observations in detail @xcite .",
    "detailed spectral energy distributions from the near- to far - infrared have been compiled for only a few nearby star forming regions ( e.g. strom et  al .",
    "1989 ; wilking , lada , & young  1989 ) , but @xmath11- , @xmath12- , @xmath13- , and @xmath14-band imaging studies provide an efficient means to search for near - infrared excesses in hundreds of stars ( often in clusters ) of various ages .",
    "recent results indicate that at least 50% of solar mass stars at an age of @xmath31  myr exhibit a near - infrared excess , but that the percentage decreases to @xmath1510% for ages 3 - 10  myr @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with the notion that the lifetime of accretion disks around most solar mass stars is @xmath33 - 10  myr .",
    "strictly speaking , a near - infrared excess is diagnostic of only hot dust with temperatures of @xmath31000  k. for a solar mass star , these temperatures are found only within @xmath30.1  au of the star .",
    "most of the dust mass , and presumably the majority of planet formation , will be located at larger radii and have temperatures too cool to radiate in the near - infrared .",
    "further , some disks are thought to have inner holes such that stars without near - infrared excesses may still contain substantial disk masses .",
    "( although 10   observations suggest that the transition from an optically thick to an optically thin disk occurs on time scales of @xmath30.3  myr , in which case near - infrared observations may in fact provide an indirect probe of the larger scale disk ; skrutskie et  al .",
    "1990 , see also haisch , lada , & lada 2001a ) .",
    "an additional limitation of near - infrared studies is that the emission is optically thick and provides little meaningful constraints on the disk mass ( see , e.g. , wood et  al .",
    "longer wavelength observations are needed to establish the disk lifetime at large orbital radii and to provide measures on how disk masses evolve with time .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter continuum emission are the best available tracers of dust in the cool , outer disk .",
    "the most comprehensive continuum surveys to date have been toward young stars in taurus @xcite , @xmath16  oph @xcite , lupus @xcite , chamaeleon  i @xcite , and serpens @xcite .",
    "these observations have shown that at an age of @xmath31  myr , @xmath320 - 30% of the stars possess a circumstellar disk with a mass greater than the minimum mass of the solar nebula ( @xmath30.01m@xmath4 ; weidenschilling 1977 , hayashi 1981 ) , and that the median disk mass is @xmath150.004m@xmath4 .",
    "further insights into disk evolution can be obtained by using rich clusters as a tool to empirically measure the mass of disks as a function of stellar mass and age in much the same manner near - infrared studies have used clusters to establish the frequency of inner accretion disks @xcite .",
    "continuum surveys of clusters are also important since an appreciable fraction of stars in molecular clouds are found in rich clusters @xcite , and the high ultraviolet radiation fields produced by o - stars in clusters may influence disk evolution @xcite .",
    "the main observational challenge to studying clusters in the millimeter continuum is that high angular resolution is required to resolve the stars and distinguish disk emission from the more extended molecular cloud .",
    "the only rich cluster surveyed to date by interferometric techniques has been the orion nebula cluster @xcite .",
    "however , these observations were 10 - 50 times less sensitive to dust mass than the observations of taurus and @xmath16  oph and did not place stringent limits on the amount of circumstellar mass around individual stars .",
    "given the limitations in inferring disk evolution from near - infrared excesses , it is important to conduct millimeter continuum observations of additional star forming regions in order to understand the evolution of disk masses at young stellar ages when planets are in their formative stages .",
    "to further measure the circumstellar disk masses in different star forming environments , i obtained @xmath173 mm continuum observations of the young cluster ic  348 with the ovro millimeter wave interferometer .",
    "based on statistical analysis of near - infrared star counts , the ic  348 cluster contains @xmath3400 stars distributed over a @xmath3@xmath18 region ( @xmath19 at the assumed distance of 320  pc ; de zeeuw et  al .",

    "a cluster age of @xmath32  myr ( luhman 1999 ; see also herbig  1998 ) has been inferred by placing the low mass stars on the hr diagram and using theoretical pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks from @xcite .",

    "the conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "a @xmath0 region toward the ic  348 cluster was mosaicked in the @xmath173 mm continuum using the ovro millimeter - wave interferometer between september 2001 and january  2002 .",
    "continuum data were recorded simultaneously in four , 1  ghz wide continuum channels centered at 96.48  ghz , 97.98  ghz , 100.98  ghz , and 102.48  ghz .",

    "the data were calibrated using the ovro mma data reduction package @xcite . the adopted continuum flux for j0336 + 323 , calibrated by observing neptune and/or uranus , was 1.60  jy .",
    "the rms dispersion in the measured flux for j0336 + 323 is 0.10  jy as computed from observations on 12 separate nights in which both the calibrator and the planets were observed .",
    "the mosaic consists of 64 pointing centers arranged in a @xmath25 grid as shown in figure  [ fig : gain ] .",
    "the pointing centers along a row are separated by 40@xmath26 ( compared to the primary fwhm beam size of 72@xmath26 ) .",
    "adjacent rows are also separated by 40@xmath26 but with pointing centers shifted by 20@xmath26 in right ascension . the mosaicking sequence consisted of obtaining a 3 minute integration on the phase calibrator followed by observing 5 positions in the mosaic for 3 minutes each .",
    "this sequence was repeated until all 64 positions in the mosaic were observed .",
    "the mosaic was observed in the ovro compact , low , equatorial , and high configurations both to increase the uv sampling and to decrease the rms noise .",
    "the top few rows in the mosaic were often observed at high airmass with lower sensitivity .",
    "additional observations of these rows were obtained to provide more uniform sensitivity across the mosaic .",
    "the 64 individual points were formed into an image using the mosaicking routines in miriad .",
    "the data were averaged using natural weighting to maximize sensitivity , resulting in a beam size of @xmath27 .",
    "unit gain was achieved over a @xmath3@xmath0 area as shown by the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : gain ] .",
    "the average rms noise within the unit gain region is 0.75  mjybeam@xmath2  and is spatially uniform over the mosaic to within 10% .",
    "before using the ovro observations to constrain the circumstellar disk masses in the ic  348 cluster , i review the stellar properties of the ic  348 cluster members located within the mosaic boundaries . the stellar and substellar membership list of the ic  348 cluster was compiled from the spectroscopic observations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and the narrow band imaging survey by @xcite .",
    "to ensure a reliable list of cluster members , only sources brighter than @xmath28=14.5 were considered cluster members for this study , as the field star contamination becomes appreciable at fainter magnitudes @xcite . in total , 95 cluster members brighter than @xmath28=14.5 have been identified within the ovro mosaic .",
    "astrometry for these sources was adopted from 2mass . the astrometric uncertainty ( @xmath150.2@xmath26 )",
    "is 20 times less than the synthesized beam size .",
    "stellar masses and ages for 92 of the 95 cluster members have been estimated using the @xcite theoretical pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks and published spectroscopic and photometric data as described in @xcite .",

    "the mean age of the stellar population is @xmath32  myr .",
    "the properties of this subsample agree well with the properties of the entire ic  348 population identified so far @xcite .    to investigate the frequency distribution of inner accretion disks in this subsample of the ic  348 cluster , figure  [ fig : ccd ] shows the @xmath29 vs. @xmath30 and @xmath29 vs. @xmath31 color - color diagrams .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath28 photometry are from 2mass , and the @xmath14-band photometry is from @xcite . only sources with no processing flags in the 2mass database are shown . in figure",

    "however , for each of these four stars , the magnitude of the apparent @xmath30 excess is less than the 1@xmath5 photometric uncertainties and therefore may be attributed to photometric noise .",
    "the fraction of stars with an infrared excess is higher in the @xmath29 vs. @xmath31 diagram since @xmath14-band shows larger contrast between the disk and photospheric emission . of the 47 stars with available @xmath11 ,",

    "therefore , a minimum of @xmath3 15% of the 95 ic  348 members within the ovro mosaic have near - infrared colors indicative of an optically thick , inner accretion disk . by comparison ,",
    "@xcite estimate that the @xmath365% of the stars in the ic  348 cluster brighter than @xmath13=12 have a @xmath21 excess .",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] shows gray scale and contour maps of the ovro mosaic . in the contour map ,",
    "the dotted curve shows the unit gain boundary of the mosaic , and the open circles indicate the positions of the 95 known members of the ic  348 cluster within the unit gain boundary .",

    "visual inspection of the contour map shows that none of the known ic  348 cluster members have been detected in the @xmath173 mm continuum at the 3@xmath5 level or greater . over the entire mosaic ,",
    "the brightest observed flux is only 3.9@xmath5 above the noise , and the frequency distribution of fluxes are consistent with gaussian noise as shown by the solid circles in figure  [ fig : flux ] .",
    "therefore there are no definitive continuum detections in the mosaic .",
    "circumstellar disks in taurus typically have diameters of @xmath15300  au as measured in the @xmath173 mm continuum @xcite . assuming that the disks in ic  348 are similar , the disks can be considered point sources at the resolution of these observations ( 1600  au@xmath331300  au ) when computing upper limits to the continuum flux .",
    "a histogram of the observed fluxes toward the 95 cluster members is shown in figure  [ fig : flux ] .",

    "these results indicate that while the flux distribution is consistent with gaussian noise , there is a positive bias to the average flux at the 2.8@xmath5 confidence level .",
    "the ovro continuum observations can be used to place constraints on the circumstellar disk masses . in reality",
    ", most disks will contain a range of dust temperatures with decreasing temperatures with increasing radial distance from the star .",
    "the data obtained here do not permit sophisticated modeling of the disk structure , however , and a single dust temperature was assumed .",
    "following @xcite , the disk mass ( i.e. sum of the dust and gas components ) can then be estimated as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the mass opacity coefficient , @xmath37 parameterizes the frequency dependence of @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the observed flux , @xmath40 is the dust temperature , and @xmath41 is the planck function . for consistency with prior studies ,",

    "if this lower value of @xmath37 is more appropriate for circumstellar disks , the assumptions adopted here will overestimate the disk masses by 50% .",
    "the appropriate dust temperature for calculating the disk masses was estimated using the circumstellar disk models from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these studies fitted radial power - law distributions for the dust temperature and disk mass surface density to the observed infrared and millimeter spectral energy distribution for well - studied stars in taurus - auriga . from the disk mass derived by these model",
    "fits , i computed a single component dust temperature for each star that reproduces the disk mass given the observed @xmath171.3 mm flux .",
    "a histogram of these ` effective' dust temperatures is shown in figure  [ fig : tdust ] .",
    "( four stars with effective temperatures greater than 100  k are not shown in this figure . ) of the 44 stars in taurus - auriga with model disk masses from @xcite and @xcite , the median dust temperature derived in this manner is @xmath320  k. if this dust temperature is then assumed for all of the taurus stars , the model - derived dust masses can be reproduced to within a factor of 2 for 60% of the stars , and within a factor of 3 for 70% of the stars .",
    "( for sources with effective dust temperatures substantially greater than 20  k , the single component dust model will overestimate the disk mass since @xmath43 ) . assuming that the disk temperatures in the ic  348 cluster are not vastly different than in taurus , adopting a dust temperature of 20  k , while simplistic , should reproduce the disk masses within a factor of a few for the majority of the stars .",
    "for these assumptions , the 3@xmath5 upper limit to the circumstellar disk mass around an individual star in the ic  348 cluster is 0.025m@xmath4 . treating the 95 cluster members as an ensemble",
    ", the observed average flux corresponds to an average disk mass of @xmath10m@xmath4 .",
    "the limits on the disk masses in the ic  348 cluster can be compared to disk masses in other star forming regions as a step toward determining the evolution of disk masses as a function of time and environment ( e.g. `` clustered '' vs. `` isolated '' star formation ) .",
    "the taurus star forming region provides a meaningful comparison since it has been thoroughly studied in the millimeter continuum ( beckwith et  al .",
    "1990 ; osterloh & beckwith  1995 ; see also skinner , brown , & walter  1991 and henning et  al .",
    "1998 ) , and the stellar population has an age similar to ic  348 as shown below . since the ic  348 sample has been identified largely based on spectroscopy , only stars in taurus with spectral types and sufficient photometric information to place the stars on the hr diagram were used for this comparison . from the database of spectral types and photometry compiled from the literature by @xcite ,",
    "117 stars were identified in taurus that met these criteria and have a published @xmath171.3 mm continuum flux measurement .",
    "the main source of incompleteness in the taurus sample are deeply embedded iras sources which are not detected at optical wavelengths @xcite , and recently identified low mass stars and brown dwarfs @xcite that have not yet been surveyed in the millimeter continuum .",
    "the open histograms in the top panels of figures  [ fig : mass ] and [ fig : age ] show the mass and age distributions respectively for the taurus comparison sample .",
    "( the bottom panels show the analogous distributions for the ic  348 sample as already discussed . )",
    "the mean stellar mass of the taurus sample is log@xmath44 ( mass / m@xmath4 ) = @xmath45 with a dispersion of 0.27 . by comparison , the ic  348 sample",
    "has a mean log@xmath44 stellar mass of @xmath46 with a dispersion of 0.44 .",
    "therefore , the stellar mass distribution in ic  348 is skewed toward smaller stellar masses compared to the taurus sample . similarly , the mean stellar age of the taurus sample is log@xmath44 ( age / yr ) = 6.0 with dispersion of 0.6 , while the mean log@xmath44 age and dispersion for ic  348 are 6.3 and 0.6 respectively .",
    "thus the stellar ages for ic  348 are skewed toward older values than stars in taurus .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the distances to the star forming regions , which is at least @xmath310% , @xcite , will produce a @xmath30.09 dex uncertainty in the mean age @xcite .",
    "at best then the difference in the mean ages between taurus and ic  348 are significant at the @xmath32@xmath5 confidence level .",
    "disk masses for stars in taurus were re - computed from published @xmath171.3 mm fluxes and using the isothermal dust model adopted here for consistency .",
    "the hatched histograms in figures  [ fig : mass ] and [ fig : age ] show the distribution of stellar masses and ages for stars in taurus that have disk masses in excess of 0.025m@xmath4 , which is the 3@xmath5 upper limit to the disk masses toward individual stars in ic  348 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows that in this taurus sample , such disks masses are found only around stars more massive than 0.27m@xmath4 . while the lack of such massive disks around lower mass stars may simply be due to the relative lack of sources , only stars more massive than 0.27m@xmath4  are used in the following comparison between taurus and ic  348 . in the taurus sample , 14 of the 99 stars with stellar masses greater than 0.27m@xmath4",
    "have disk masses in excess of 0.025m@xmath4 . in ic  348 ,",
    "none of the 48 stars in the same stellar mass range have such disk masses .",
    "using the two - tailed fisher exact test , the probability that the frequency distribution of massive disks in ic  348 and taurus have been drawn from the same parent population is 0.0028 .",
    "this probability is independent of the assumed values of @xmath42 and @xmath47 used to compute the disk masses to the extent that the disk properties in the two regions are similar . however ,",
    "if the value of @xmath37 is as low as 0.5 on average @xcite as opposed to the assumed value of @xmath37=1 , then the disk masses in ic  348 will be systematically overestimated compared to taurus , and the difference in the frequency of massive disks will be enhanced .",
    "thus despite the similar stellar ages of the star forming regions , the ic  348 cluster lacks the massive disks found in the taurus at the @xmath33@xmath5 confidence level .",
    "the cause of this apparent difference can not be due to an photoevaporation of the disks in ic  348 from a high ultraviolet radiation field ( e.g. johnstone , hollenbach , & bally  1998 ) since the spectral type of the most massive cluster member in ic  348 is b5 @xcite .",
    "whether or not the difference in disk masses can be attributed to the affects of a `` cluster '' vs. `` isolated '' environment remains speculative given the limited sample of star forming regions , although continuum surveys of additional clusters are possible with current interferometers .",
    "the ic  348 results can also be compared to the disk masses in orion  nebula cluster using the 86  ghz continuum survey by @xcite . again using a 20  k dust temperature for consistency with the assumptions adopted here , the 3@xmath5 upper limit to individual disk masses in orion",
    "is 0.17m@xmath4 . @xcite",
    "derived a 95% upper limit to the characteristic flux at 86  ghz of 1.1mjy , which corresponds to a disk mass of 0.03m@xmath4 .",
    "thus the results from @xcite exclude the presence of massive disks in orion , but do not set as stringent limits as the ic  348 observations for disk masses in cluster environments .",
    "similarly , @xcite derived a 3@xmath5 upper limit of 0.015m@xmath4  to the disk mass around 5 proplyds in the orion nebula cluster for an assumed dust temperature of 50  k. if a 20  k dust temperature is instead adopted , the corresponding upper limit is 0.047m@xmath4 .    finally , the ic  348 results can be contrasted with the minimum disk mass needed to form the solar system . summing the mass contained in the planets and assuming an interstellar gas to dust ratio , the minimum mass of the primitive solar nebula is @xmath30.01m@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this minimum mass reflects primarily the mass needed to form a jupiter - mass planet .",
    "the actual mass of the primitive solar nebula may of course be higher depending on the efficiency in converting dust and gas in the primitive solar nebula into planets .",
    "the upper limit to the typical disk mass in ic  348 is comparable then to the minimum mass of the solar nebula , and the average mass is @xmath35 times lower than minimum mass of the solar nebula . given that the disk masses are uncertain by at least a factor of 3 due the mass opacity coefficient ( @xmath42 ) , these results suggest either that the formation of planets with masses greater than a few jupiter masses is relatively rare around 0.2 - 0.5m@xmath4  stars in ic  348 , or that the formation of gas - giant planets has significantly depleted the disk of small dust grains on a time scale of @xmath152  myr , the mean age of the ic  348 cluster .",

    "<S> a @xmath0 region toward the young cluster ic  348 has been imaged in the millimeter continuum at @xmath1 resolution with the ovro interferometer to a rms noise level of 0.75mjybeam@xmath2  at 98  ghz . </S>",
