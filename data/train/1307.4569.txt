    "over the past 20 years the _ gabor transform _ has become a very valuable and widely used tool in signal processing .",
    "the finite , discrete _ short time fourier transform _",
    "( stft ) for a given signal @xmath0 of length @xmath1 is computed by testing @xmath0 against shifted and modulated copies of a window function @xmath2 @xmath3 the gabor transform is a sampled version of the stft and both provide the possibility to extract temporal frequency information from the signal .",
    "the space spanned by the two variables @xmath4 is called the _ time - frequency plane _ ; more precise information can be found in section [ sec : prelims ] .",
    "a family of translations and modulations of a window function is called _",
    "gabor family _ or _",
    "gabor system_.    there exist a continuous counterparts of the stft and the gabor transform .",
    "the time frequency plane is @xmath5 in this case and general sampling sets have received attention , e.g. @xcite . sampling this plane on a discrete subgroup , also called _ lattice _",
    "@xcite admits rich structure , as described in the next section .",
    "it has recently been conjectured that for a standard gaussian window the best sampling strategy is a regular hexagonal pattern @xcite .",
    "geometric arguments have also lead to the same sampling strategies in undersampled systems for pulse shape design in wireless channel estimation @xcite .    in the discrete setting efficient algorithms exist almost exclusively for sampling on separable or rectangular lattices @xcite , the most important ones discovered quickly after finding the fast fourier transform algorithm @xcite .",
    "the two approaches that are most commonly used are the _ overlap - add algorithm _ , @xcite and the _ weighted overlap - add algorithm",
    "both of these algorithms require that the window is _ finite impulse response _ ( fir ) , i.e. the size of its support is much smaller than its length .",
    "fast , but less well known algorithms without this requirement have also been found @xcite .    it is a natural question how to generalize existing algorithms for the gabor transform and its inverse to the case of nonseparable lattices . in the early years of this century",
    "there has been a series of papers and investigations on this subject @xcite and more by the same authors , also collected in  @xcite .",
    "earlier studies focus on the computation of dual gabor windows on nonseparable lattices , using iterative methods  @xcite or harnessing the block structure of gabor analysis and frame operators directly and reducing nonseparable sampling sets to a union of product lattices  @xcite .",
    "another contribution came some years later further investigating the discrete theory of _ metaplectic operators _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present approaches from these works and propose an improved algorithm , which allows for more efficient computation .",
    "there are two fundamentally different ways of realizing computations that we will investigate and improve upon .",
    "the first one uses a decomposition of a nonseparable lattice into the union of co - sets of a sparser separable lattice similar to @xcite .",
    "this will allow to write the gabor family as a union of gabor families on this sparse lattice with different windows .",
    "we call such a system _ multiwindow gabor _ family , since it shares much of the structure from standard gabor systems @xcite .",
    "the details can be found in subsection [ ssec : multiwin ] .",
    "the second method under consideration uses the fact that any lattice can be written as the image of a rectangular lattice under an invertible lattice transform . for a special subset of these transforms , so called _ symplectic operators _ on the signal space exist that allow to reduce all the computations for gabor systems on nonseparable lattices to gabor systems on rectangular lattices .",
    "it turns out that in the @xmath6 dimensional setting the transformation to the separable case is always possible @xcite .",
    "this method has first been described for the continuous case , a summary can be found in @xcite and then translated into the finite discrete setting , where it takes more effort to obtain the results due to number theoretic considerations .",
    "the algorithms presented in subsection [ ssec : snf ] are based on the results in @xcite and improved in [ ssec : shears ] .    in higher dimensions",
    "the class of lattices that can be reduced to a rectangular sampling strategy is expected to be a strict subset of all lattices . while the class of lattice transforms that admit a symplectic operator , called _",
    "symplectic matrices _ , can be determined explicitly it is not easy to see whether a given lattice can be transformed to rectangular shape using this class of matrices .",
    "in contrast to the difficulties with generalizing the metaplectic approach to higher dimensions , the multiwindow decomposition can be extended directly .",
    "however , the description of the multidimensional case is beyond the scope of this contribution .    after introducing the necessary basic concepts in section [ sec : prelims ]",
    ", we mainly present the different approaches in section [ sec : nonseplatts ] .",
    "section [ sec : implementation ] describes the implementation of the different algorithms and compares their computational complexity and running time .",
    "we use the `` @xmath7 '' notation in conjunction with the dft to denote the variable over which the transform is to be applied .",
    "we recall some basics from gabor analysis , frame theory and the theory of metaplectic operators on @xmath8 .",
    "a _ gabor system _ in @xmath8 is a set of functions of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote a time shift by @xmath13 and a frequency shift ( or modulation ) by @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 with @xmath16 considered modulo @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a gabor system is a set of time - frequency shifts of a fixed function @xmath2 .",
    "for some given @xmath13 and @xmath14 we introduce also the notation of a time - frequency shift operator @xmath17    the gabor coefficients of some @xmath18 , with respect to @xmath19 are given by the samples of the short - time fourier transform @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to know if the signal @xmath0 can be reconstructed from its transform coefficients @xmath22 .",
    "if so , we call the gabor system @xmath19 a frame .",
    "it turns out that this is equivalent to the invertibility of the so - called frame operator defined as @xmath23 from here on , we will use the shorthand notation @xmath24 whenever there is no confusion as to the gabor system @xmath19 used . by inversion of this operator",
    "we can give an explicit inversion formula @xmath25 the family @xmath26 is called the ( canonical ) dual gabor system .",
    "if @xmath27 is a subgroup of the phase space , then we know from standard gabor theory that the dual system is a gabor system itself , given by @xmath28 , see e.g. @xcite . in the following we will only consider this structured case and denote the subgroup relation by @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to see that for any matrix @xmath30 the set @xmath31 forms a subgroup of the time - frequency plane .",
    "the following proposition shows that the converse is also true .",
