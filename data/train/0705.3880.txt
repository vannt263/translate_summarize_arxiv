    "during the last few years , there are intensive studies on the optical properties of single semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) , since they exhibit atom - like energy spectrum and sharp lines in photoluminescence as well as the advantage that they can be conveniently manipulated by the external fields .",
    "semiconductor qds have been been demonstrated as one of the candidates for the single - photon or entangled two - photon sources , which make them very attractive for applications in the fields of quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation .",
    "@xcite in the first proposal for a qd - based source of polarization entangled photon pairs , a necessary condition is that the intermediate monoexciton states for the biexciton radiative decay are energetically degenerate .",
    "@xcite however , the iii - v self - assembled semiconductor qds tend to be elongated along the @xmath0 $ ] crystal axis and the monoexciton states are split by the anisotropic electron - hole exchange interaction .",
    "@xcite consequently , much effort is devoted to the reduction of the fine - structure splitting of the intermediate exciton states , e.g. , thermal annealing and external field tuning .",
    "@xcite    neglecting the electron - hole exchange interaction , the exciton ground state is four - fold degenerate . for in@xmath1ga@xmath2as qds with @xmath3 or lower symmetry , however , the electron - hole exchange interaction splits the exciton ground state into bright and dark doublets , which are separated by about few hundred @xmath4ev .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the bright doublets are split into two linearly polarized states separated by about tens of @xmath4ev .",
    "@xcite at zero external field , the fine - structure splitting of the bright doublet mainly depends on the anisotropy and size of qds .",
    "@xcite if a magnetic field is applied in a voigt configuration , the bright states are mixed with the dark states through the zeeman term and the dark exciton states become optically active .",
    "@xcite due to the zeeman splitting induced by the magnetic field , the fine - structure splitting of bright doublet could be tuned to zero by the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite in addition , thermal annealing  @xcite and an in - plane electric field  @xcite could lead to a significant reduction of the fine - structure splitting .",
    "recently , with the development of high - quality qd structures , it is possible to fabricate either vertically- or laterally - coupled self - assembled qds , namely `` quantum dot molecule '' ( qdm ) .",
    "@xcite the exciton ground states exhibit fine structures induced by the electron and hole tunnel - coupling between the two dots .",
    "@xcite the exciton states and interdot coupling could be manipulated by the electric field in either vertically- or laterally - coupled qdm .",
    "@xcite significant stark effect  @xcite and pronounced anticrossing of different excitonic transitions  @xcite have been observed in the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra .",
    "according to several numerical calculations ,  @xcite interdot coupling as well as the symmetry between the two dots strongly influence the exciton levels and optical properties .",
    "previously , we found that fine - structure splitting of the exciton ground state in laterally - coupled qdm could be tuned to zero by applying an in - plane electric field of only few kv / cm , which might overcome the deficiency in a single qd .",
    "@xcite polarization entangled photon pairs might be prepared in a qdm through the biexciton radiative decay . thus clarifying the mechanism of the variation of fine - structure splitting in qdms with various interdot separations is very important . in this paper",
    ", we study the symmetry and tunnel - coupling effects on the fine - structure splitting of exciton states in qdms . exciton levels of symmetric and nonsymmetric qdms without the electron - hole exchange interaction are given , and we note that the exciton level spacing is much larger than the electron - hole exchange energies .",
    "fine - structure splittings of the two - lowest exciton levels are contributed from the intra- and interdot exchange interactions .",
    "symmetry and tunnel - coupling in qdm strongly influence the exciton envelope functions , and therefore it is interesting that intra- and interdot exchange interactions might be strongly dependent on the symmetry and tunnel - coupling .",
    "moreover , the variations of the fine - structure splittings of exciton ground and excited states are compared and discussed .    in sec .",
    "ii , a microscopic theory of exciton levels and fine - structure splitting in qdm is formulated . in sec .",

    "<S> exciton levels and fine - structure splitting in laterally - coupled quantum dot molecules are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the electron and hole tunneling energies as well as the direct coulomb interaction are essential for the exciton levels . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that fine - structure splittings of the two - lowest exciton levels are contributed from the intra- and interdot exchange interactions which are greatly influenced by the symmetry and tunnel - coupling between the two dots . </S>",
    "<S> as the inter - dot separation is reduced , fine - structure splitting of the exciton ground state is largely increased while those of the excited states are decreased . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dependence of the fine - structure splitting in quantum dot molecules on the coulomb correlation is clearly clarified . </S>"
