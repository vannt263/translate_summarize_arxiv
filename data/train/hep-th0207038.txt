    "the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel proves to be important in a series of physical applications .",
    "its coefficients specify the divergences and conformal anomalies taking place in a concrete field theory model  @xcite , the high temperature behaviour of the thermodynamic functions  @xcite and so on  @xcite .    for a flat manifold with a smooth boundary",
    "the heat kernel coefficients are determined by local characteristics of the boundary  @xcite .",
    "if the boundary has discontinuities ( for example , it is piecewise smooth ) , then the latter give additional contributions to the heat kernel coefficients  @xcite .",
    "usually in physical applications one assumes that the boundary is smooth .",
    "however there is a series of problems where such assumption is certainly not acceptable .",
    "a typical example here is supplied by fields defined between two plates which cross at a given angle , i.e. , inside a dihedral angle .",
    "such a configuration is considered when calculating the casimir effect for a conducting wedge  @xcite .",
    "if the fields inside a dihedral are subjected to periodicity condition with respect to the angular variable then one is concerned in fact with the fields on a cone , and the point where the boundary has discontinuity becomes an internal point of the cone surface .",
    "however the origin of this singularity is the same as in the case of fields inside the wedge .",
    "the conical singularity proved to be very important in many areas of mathematical physics  @xcite and lately it is investigated in connection with studies of quantum fields on the background of black holes  @xcite and cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "the general consideration of the boundary nonsmothness in terms of the heat kernel expansion lacks till now  @xcite .",
    "such contributions to the heat kernel coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been investigated in papers  @xcite . for a plane domain",
    "the contribution to @xmath2 generated by an edge of the boundary is known  @xcite and by its limiting configuration , by cusp .",
    "it is interesting to note that a cusp pointing outward , with respect to the domain under study , leads to change of the power of the asymptotic variable ( time ) in the heat kernel expansion @xcite in comparison with the standard case . in references  @xcite",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel with allowance for the boundary nonsmothness has been built by calculating the relevant green function of the heat conduction equation .",
    "the present paper seeks to show the effectiveness of applying the spectral zeta functions for the calculation of the contributions to the heat kernel coefficients caused by such boundary discontinuities as the corners . for this goal we shall use the technique for constructing the zeta functions developed in  @xcite and extended in  @xcite",
    "this method proves to be very effective for calculating the heat kernel coefficients for different boundary conditions given on a sphere and cylinder  @xcite .",
    "a close approach has been used in @xcite .",
    "we shall consider internal and external parts of a plane sector formed by two infinite radial rays emerging from the center of a circle of radius @xmath3 at angle @xmath4 to one another ( see figure 1 , where i is the internal circular sector and ii is the external circular sector ) .",
    "the choice of such domains with nonsmooth boundary is caused by the possibility of constructing for them the global zeta functions .",
    "the latter can not be done , for example , for an open angle ( figure  1 without circular arc inside the angle ) .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail in section  ii . in both the sectors",
    "the laplace operator is defined acting on scalar real functions subjected to the dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions .",
    "if we substitute in figure  1 the radial rays by crossed planes and the circular arc 1  2 by an appropriate part of a cylinder surface we arrive at the boundary value problems which have the same heat kernel coefficients as in the plane case .    identifying the points of the boundary with the polar coordinates @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. , imposing the periodicity condition with respect to the angular variable @xmath7 with a period @xmath4 , we arrive obviously at the spectral problem for the laplace operator on two parts of lateral surface of a cone @xmath8 : internal part @xmath9 and external part @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "we can , as before , impose the dirichlet or neumann conditions",
    ".    in the present paper , six coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for the boundary value problems specified above will be calculated by making use of the relevant zeta functions .",
    "it will be shown that each of these coefficients , starting from the third one , is the sum of contributions generated by the corners of the boundary and by the curvature of the arc 12 .",
    "analysis of the obtained results enables one to reveal some regularities obeyed by the contributions of the boundary nonsmoothness to the heat kernel coefficients , namely : i ) the corner contribution substantially depends on whether the corner is made up by crossing two straight lines or two lines with nonzero curvature ; ii ) contributions of adjacent angles to the heat kernel coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 have opposite signs in the same way as the contributions of a circular arc to the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the internal and external regions . in the case of a polygon or its cylindrical generalization",
    "the rules are formulated for obtaining all the heat kernel coefficients for the minus laplace operator .",
    "the implications of the obtained results in the casimir energy calculations with employment of the zeta function technique are also considered . in particular",
    ", it is shown that nonsmoothness of the boundary does not make always worse the situation with calculation of the vacuum energy in the framework of the zeta regularization method .",
    "for example , the corner contributions can simply be mutually cancelled in the same way as the contributions of the curved boundary are cancelled when taking into account the internal and external regions .",
    "besides , the analysis conducted enables one to infer that it is very unlikely to get a finite and unique result for the vacuum energy by smoothing the boundary singularities , e.g. , by taking into account the atomic structure of the boundary or quantum fluctuations of the boundary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the detailed discussion of the choice of the domains with piece - wise smooth boundary ( internal and external circular sectors ) , for which the complete spectral zeta functions can be constructed . in section",
    "3 the heat kernel coefficients are calculated for internal circular sector by making use of the counter integral representation for the corresponding zeta functions @xcite . in section  4 the contributions to the heat kernel coefficients of the individual boundary discontinuities ( corners of different angles )",
    "are identified .",
    "further ( in section 5 ) the heat kernel coefficients for the union of both the sectors are calculated and the coefficients for the external sector are obtained as the regarding differences .",
    "technically it turns out to be simpler in comparison with calculation of the heat kernel coefficients for the external sector alone .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for the union of internal and external sectors is constructed by differentiation of the logarithm of the function specifying the frequency equation  @xcite . in section 6 the identification of the individual contributions of boundary nonsmoothness to heat kernel coefficients for external sector",
    "is carried out . some general rules for these contributions",
    "are revealed here for both sectors . in section  7",
    "we conclude with a few summarizing remarks .",
    "when choosing the domain for investigating the contribution to the heat kernel coefficients of the boundary discontinuities we pursue two goals : the boundary of a domain should have a sufficient number of discontinuities and at the same time for this domain one can construct the spectral zeta function . in order to investigate the corner singularities of the boundary one should at first sight take the most simple configuration , namely , the angle on plane formed by two radial unrestricted rays or dihedral in space .",
    "however , for these domains the global zeta functions can not be constructed .",
    "let us explain this point in detail .",
    "we consider the laplace operator @xmath16 acting on the scalar functions defined inside the dihedral of opening angle @xmath17 ( wedge of an angle @xmath4 , @xmath18 ) and subjected to the dirichlet conditions on the wedge sides . in cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath19 )",
    "the eigenfunctions in this problem are @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bessel function .",
    "the operator @xmath23 has the following eigenvalues @xmath24 these eigenvalues do not depend on the quantum number @xmath25 , i.e. , there is a degeneracy with respect to this number , the multiplicity of this degeneracy being infinite and @xmath26 is a nonisolated point .",
    "in fact , the spectrum is continuous according to the terminology of spectral theory of operators in hilbert space  @xcite and @xmath27 are not eigenvalues as the eigenfunctions are not square integrable . ]",
    "@xmath28    the global spectral zeta function of the operator @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is determined as the trace of the operator  @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath34th eigenvalue of the operator @xmath29 , and @xmath35 is the degeneracy of this eigenvalue .",
    "obviously , this definition does not work when @xmath35 is infinite .",
    "in order to remove this degeneracy we put inside a dihedral a cylindrical boundary as it is shown in figure  1 ( the arc 12 ) . on the internal and external sides of this boundary",
    "the scalar field will obey the dirichlet or neumann conditions .",
    "thus , we are considering the internal ( i ) and external ( ii ) sectors .",
    "certainly , the union of these two sectors is not identical to unrestricted dihedral ( to a wedge ) , because now the values of the field on the arc 12 are not arbitrary but they are determined by the corresponding boundary conditions . in the new configuration there appear additional discontinuities of the boundary at the points 1 and 2 .",
    "however at these points the angle , at which the involved boundary surfaces intersect , is fixed ( it is equal to @xmath36 ) .",
    "it will be shown below that the contribution of such boundary singularities to the heat kernel coefficients can be easily separated from the contribution of the corner at the origin .",
    "the latter is proportional to the difference @xmath37 , because at @xmath38 the singularity at the origin disappears .",
    "we shall concern with the standard asymptotic expansion of heat kernel @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the dimension of the manifold under study and es stands for the exponentially small corrections as @xmath41 .",
    "this definition leads to the same heat kernel coefficients @xmath42 for a dihedral and for corresponding plane problem obtained by crossing of the dihedral by a transverse plane .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath43 in these two problems obey the relation @xmath44 hence @xmath45 taking into account the definition ( [ eq2 - 5 ] ) one easily deduce from ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) that the heat kernel coefficients @xmath42 in two eigenvalue boundary problems , mentioned above , are equal . here",
    "one should bear in mind that the heat kernel @xmath46 and its coefficients are referred to a unite length along the oz axes . in view of this , when calculating the heat kernel coefficients we shall consider either the spectral problem on a plane @xmath47 or in the space @xmath48 , pursuing only simplicity of calculation .",
    "at first we consider only internal sector ( the region i in figure 1 ) for @xmath49 , i.e. , for internal sector of a dihedral or a wedge .",
    "we employ here the technique developed in  @xcite and extended to the generalized bounded cone in  @xcite ( see also book  @xcite ) . in this approach",
    "the spectral zeta function @xmath50 should be constructed in the beginning , and then the relevant heat kernel coefficients are calculated through the relation  @xcite @xmath51    for the dirichlet boundary conditions the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath52 in the region i are defined by equation ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) , with @xmath26 being the roots of the equations @xmath53 here the subscript @xmath54 numbers the nonzero roots of these equations for fixed @xmath25 .",
    "the relevant eigenvalues are defined by equation  ( [ eq2 - 2 ] ) with @xmath55 @xmath56 in view of the behavior of the bessel function near zero @xmath57 it follows that the frequency equation  ( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) has the zero root of ` multiplicity ' @xmath58 .",
    "such roots should be removed from the definition of the spectral zeta function ( [ eq2 - 4 ] ) .",
    "therefore instead of equation  ( [ eq3 - 2 ] ) we shall use the following frequency equation @xmath59 according to the general definition ( [ eq2 - 4 ] ) the zeta function in the problem under study is given by @xmath60 as usual we substitute the sum over @xmath61 in this formula by the contour integral in the plane of a complex variable  @xmath26 @xmath62\\,{,}\\ ] ] where the contour @xmath63 encloses counter clockwise the positive roots of equations  ( [ eq3 - 4 ] ) .",
    "on deforming the contour @xmath63 in an appropriate way and integrating with respect to @xmath64 by means of the formula @xmath65 we arrive at the result @xmath66\\,{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the analytical continuation of ( [ eq3 - 8 ] ) into the left half - plane of the complex variable @xmath68 is accomplished by making use of the uniform asymptotic expansion of the function @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the known polynomials in @xmath73 .",
    "their explicit form and the corresponding recurrent relations can be found in references  @xcite . keeping in this expansion all the terms proportional to @xmath74 with @xmath75 one can write @xmath76 where @xmath77    in accordance with this expansion we represent the zeta function in equation  ( [ eq3 - 9 ] ) as the following sum @xmath78 where @xmath79 in these formulas @xmath80 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath81    substituting ( [ eq3 - 9a ] ) into equation  ( [ eq3 - 12 ] ) and taking into account the value of the integral @xmath82 we obtain for the function @xmath83 the final expression @xmath84 the product @xmath85 has simple poles at the points @xmath86 , and @xmath87 with the respective residua @xmath88 multiplying these residua by @xmath89 we obtain , according to equation  ( [ eq3 - 1 ] ) , the contributions of the function @xmath90 to the heat kernel coefficients @xmath91 , and @xmath14 , respectively .    by making use of the table integral  @xcite @xmath92 we recast equation  ( [ eq3 - 13 ] ) to the form",
    "@xmath93 the expression @xmath94 has simple poles at the points @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the residua @xmath97 which give the respective contributions to the heat kernel coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath14 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "calculation of the functions @xmath99 , defined in equation  ( [ eq3 - 14 ] ) , can be carried out with hardly any trouble .",
    "their contribution to the heat kernel coefficients are given in table 1 . in order to get the complete values of these coefficients one should sum all the elements of respective rows .",
    "in this case the operator @xmath100 has the following eigenfunctions in internal circular sector i ( see figure  1 ) @xmath101 @xmath102 here @xmath103 are the roots of the equations @xmath104 taking into account the behavior of the derivative of the bessel function at the origin @xmath105 , we multiply equation([eq3 - 23 ] ) by @xmath106 in order to exclude the zero multiple roots @xmath107    by making use of the frequency equations ( [ eq3 - 24 ] ) we can write immediately the integral representations for the zeta function in the problem at hand analogous to equation([eq3 - 8 ] ) @xmath108{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the coefficient @xmath109 is has been defined in equation([eq3 - 15 ] ) .",
