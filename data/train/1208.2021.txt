    "in experimental investigations of the pion , a great deal of experimental data concerning its electromagnetic structure , as its electromagnetic form factor @xmath0 , has been reported  @xcite . in the theory of light mesons , relevant problems considered in the literature concern , for instance , the calculation of the mass and decay constant of the pion in a relativistic potential model of independent quarks  @xcite , the study of masses and electroweak properties of light mesons in a relativistic quark model  @xcite and the study of a relativistic treatment of pion wave functions in the annihilation @xmath1  @xcite , beside a lot of other works in which are considered calculations involving light mesons , as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical ways for describing so many experimental data is to adopt the light - front field theory formalism  @xcite . a model inspired by qcd",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a particular description based on a nonsymmetrical vertex model , as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in it ,",
    "the light - front formalism is applied to the electromagnetic form factor , calculated with the @xmath2 components of the currents of the quark - antiquark bound states of the pion .",
    "methods based on the light - front formalism have been successful in the description of the electromagnetic properties of the hadronic wave functions  @xcite .    in the following",
    ", the light - front model with the nonsymmetrical vertex ( nsv model ) for the pion is briefly described , followed by the numerical results for the pion electromagnetic form factor and electromagnetic radius .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor in light - front field theory can be performed in the covariant form as : @xmath3 in which @xmath4 and the matrix elements of the electromagnetic current @xmath5 are given by @xmath6\\gamma(k , p^{\\prime})\\gamma(k , p ) ,   \\label{current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the quark propagator and @xmath8 is the number of colors .",
    "we adopt in our calculations the breit frame , by considering initial momenta @xmath9 , final momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 . as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , the electromagnetic form factor of the pion receives only a valence contribution to the plus component of the electromagnetic current . in the case of the nsv model , @xmath12 is the regulator vertex function known as nonsymmetrical vertex , which can be written as  @xcite : @xmath13 the form factor @xmath14 in the nsv model , using the @xmath2 component of the electromagnetic current , can be expressed with the light - front wave function , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , according with : @xmath15 in which @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the fraction of the carried momentum by the quark .",
    "the light - front wave function with the nonsymmetric vertex can be written as : @xmath19 here , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the free mass operator .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath22 obeys the condition @xmath23 .",
    "in the numerical calculations , we initially considered the parameters @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 gev . for the input data cited , we obtained for the pion charge radius the value @xmath27 fm , with an error about 2% smaller than the experimental value ( @xmath28 fm )  @xcite . in order to improve the description of the experimental data",
    ", we explored the variation of the regulator mass @xmath29 and studied its influence on the form factor for low and intermediate momentum range .",
    "-.25 cm    we show in figure [ lcp1 ] the numerical results obtained in the nsv model for the electromagnetic form factor of the pion , up to 10  @xmath30 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "by analyzing the curves in figure [ lcp1 ] , we conclude that @xmath31 gev provides the best value to describe with more precision the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "values of the regulator mass smaller than @xmath32 gev and above @xmath33 gev do not show good agreement with the experimental data for a wide range of momenta . in order to confirm the best value of @xmath29",
    ", one can calculate the electromagnetic radius .",
    "in fact , we have calculated it for all of the values considered and , for @xmath31 gev , we obtain @xmath34 fm , with a 0.2% deviation of the experimental value . in order to check our model",
    ", we also calculated the pion decay constant for @xmath31 gev , obtaining @xmath35 93.1 mev , very close to the experimental value @xmath36 92.2 mev .",
    "-.2 cm we conclude that the best value of the regulator mass for the nonsymmetrical vertex model in the light - front formalism is @xmath37 1.0 gev . with that value , it is possible to describe with the best precision the experimental data for the electromagnetic form factor of pion .",
    "we also studied the dependence of the model on the regulator mass .",
    "the numerical results show that the model significantly breaks down for @xmath38 0.8 gev and also fails for higher values , above 1.3 gev .",
