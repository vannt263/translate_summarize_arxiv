    "this symmetry allows to develop @xmath87 @xcite as an expansion in powers of momenta and masses of the lightest mesons ( that acquire mass through explicit chiral symmetry breaking ) , over a typical hadronic scale which can be identified with the lightest resonances or the chiral symmetry breaking scale",

    "this , in turn , results in a decrease of the branching ratio of @xmath135 for @xmath183 and @xmath200 for @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , it is essential to include this contribution in the muon decay channel .",
    "this explains why the @xmath177 normalized invariant mass distribution was peaked in the @xmath102 mass region for either channel , since the @xmath196 form factor is proportional to the isovector component of the electromagnetic di - pion form factor .",
    "a future study of the data corresponding to the @xmath3-dominated part of the spectrum will also allow to test the hadronization proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath201 decays .",
    "in particular , in that reference it was found that @xmath202 with @xmath203 for a photon energy threshold of @xmath204 mev . the @xmath3 part , whose contribution was found to be @xmath205 , could be tested through the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) decays considered in this paper .",
    "this knowledge can also be extended to the computation of the radiative corrections to the ratio @xmath206 @xcite , relevant for lepton universality tests @xcite .    finally , the study of radiative tau decays is also important for a faithful modelling of backgrounds in lepton flavour violation searches , as it was noted for the @xmath201 decays in the case where the pion is missidentified as a muon and resembles the @xmath207 @xcite signal .",
    "the standard simulation of the radiative decay is performed with photos @xcite , which only includes the scalar @xmath2 contribution neglecting the @xmath3 parts .",
    "analogously , the @xmath208 ( @xmath1 ) decays under consideration might also mimick the @xmath209 processes .",
    "although it seems that the inclusion of @xmath4 contributions for the @xmath185 case will be important ( as the @xmath3 part gives the bulk of the branching ratio ) , a devoted study is needed to confirm this , because the involved processes are three- and four - body decays , which complicates things with respect to the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the kinematics of @xmath207 is completely fixed selecting the photons with almost maximal energy in @xmath201 decays as the relevant background .",
    "we have studied for the first time the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) decays .",
    "we have evaluated the model - independent contributions by using @xmath2 and have obtained the structure - dependent part ( @xmath210 vertex ) using @xmath211 .",
    "this approach ensures the low - energy limit of @xmath61 and includes the lightest resonances as active degrees of freedom worked out within the convenient antisymmetric tensor formalism .",
    "we have been able to predict all the couplings involved in the relevant lagrangian term using short - distance qcd constraints ( in the @xmath27 limit and restricting the spectrum to the lowest - lying spin - one resonances ) on the related green functions and form factors and considered the error stemming from this procedure in a conservative way .    within this framework",
    "we predict @xmath5 and @xmath212 $ ] . we find that while the @xmath183 decays should be within discovery reach at the future super - flavour facilities",
    ", this will only be possible for the @xmath185 decays if they happen to be close to the upper limit of the range we have given .",
    "the studied hadronic currents are ready for installation in the @xmath211 based version @xcite of tauola , the standard monte carlo generator for tau lepton decays .",
