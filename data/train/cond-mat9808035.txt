    "the formulation of wave propagation by using the huygens principle was investigated some years ago by the transmission line matrix modeling method ( tlm )  @xcite .",
    "this method retrieves the maxwell equations by introducing current and voltage impulses which propagate along the bonds and are scattered on the nodes of a mesh of transmission lines .",
    "refinements lead the tlm method to describe complex boundary conditions , gain or losses and propagation in inhomogeneous media for electromagnetic waves  @xcite .",
    "such an idea was renewed recently for studying time - dependent wave propagation for scalar waves in inhomogeneous media  @xcite . instead of considering currents or voltage pulses",
    ", the authors introduced some arbitrary scalar quantities that propagate on a cartesian lattice .",
    "both approaches include the action - by - proximity of the pulses , or of the scalar quantities , when they propagate from node to node in one time step and the emission of secondary waves at each node by means of a scattering process which emits the incident energy in all directions .",
    "since voltage and current impulses are equivalent to electric and magnetic fields on a two - dimensional mesh , it is not surprising that the tlm method applies to the maxwell equations .",
    "nevertheless , the nature of the wave equations which result from such a formulation applied to scalar quantities propagating on a cartesian lattice remains unclear .",
    "a beginning of answer arises in the work of sornette _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who have enlarged the scalar model to construct the klein - gordon equation and the schrdinger equation .",
    "however , the results were limited to homogeneous media and the schrdinger equation was ill - defined in the continuum limit . in order to generalize this attempt ,",
    "a constructive approach was explored recently  @xcite to recover various kinds of scalar waves in an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "starting from basic principles and incorporating fundamental symmetries to the scattering nodes , the authors derived in a systematic way time - dependent scalar wave equations in inhomogeneous media .",
    "they exhibited a unified equation which properly tuned by a unique parameter yields either the klein - gordon equation or the schrdinger equation with a well defined continuum limit .",
    "this derivation offers a general framework , including the related tlm approach and opens up possible generalizations to describe spinor or vector wave propagation .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend this previous work to the description of discrete wave propagation equations for free spinor fields . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict the presentation to the derivation of the dirac equation on a one - dimensional regular lattice but the proof can be worked out on any underlying discrete lattice . throughout the paper ,",
    "we call currents the scalar quantities which obey a simple dynamics of propagation and scattering . the problem being linear , we define naturally the two scalar components of the spinor field as linear superpositions of those currents . in order to derive coupled propagation equations linking together both components of the spinor field , we first require closure conditions compelling the form of the matrices which describe the scattering processes . finally , by taking into account appropriate space - time relativistic symmetries , the discretized dirac equation in @xmath0 dimensions is recovered .",
    "the current model is constructed for the two usual representations of the dirac equation in @xmath0 space - time dimension , i.e. the majorana - weyl representation and the standard representation .",
    "independently from the above approach , different kinds of microscopic models describing spinor wave equations have been proposed in the literature .",
    "those models belong to two distinct classes  : they are either based on a random walk description , leading to euclidean - invariant spinor wave equations , or they rely on a complex hopping - type dynamics on a lattice , leading to relativistic - invariant spinor wave equations . the first class of microscopic probabilistic models deals with critical behavior of the free majorana spinor field where the time variable @xmath11 is turned into a parameter that controls the approach to a critical point ( the system is at criticality when @xmath12 ) .",

    "@xcite have constructed a probabilistic model , based on binomial processes , to describe the spinor field in @xmath0 space - time dimensions .",
    "as the dirac equation is recovered from real stochastic processes , their method applies only to the real majorana representation of the dirac equation .",
    "another random walk approach , including a spin factor , is developed in  @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on three - dimensional lattices and exhibits different critical behavior depending on the value of the spin .",
    "the second class of models deals with the dirac equation itself .",
    "the paradigm of those lattice models are the susskind fermions  @xcite which have been extensively used in lattice gauge theories .",
    "a different but closed approach is exposed in  @xcite , where the model describes the dynamics of point - like spinless particles on a three - dimensional square lattice in the presence of complex hopping rates of modulus unity .",
    "related works have been applied to study condensed matter topics such as the ground state of the heisenberg antiferromagnet in two or three dimensions  @xcite , or the energy spectrum of flux states  @xcite .",
    "the construction in terms of currents presented in this paper can be considered as belonging to that second class of models .",
    "the backbone of the paper are sections  [ maj ] and  [ sta ] , where we describe the construction of the dirac equation in the majorana - weyl and standard representations respectively",
    ". sections  [ dyna_maj ] and [ dyna_sta ] introduce the basis of the current model in both representations .",
    "sections  [ eq_maj ] , [ eq_sta ] , deal with the derivation of the discrete coupled propagation equations .",

    "the current model is achieved by computing the scattering matrices in section  [ scatt_maj ] . on the contrary",

    "a current propagates between two neighboring nodes in one time step .",
    "all the currents propagate simultaneously , i.e. the outgoing currents , denoted @xmath18 , @xmath19 , leave the nodes at some time @xmath11 and become incident currents on the neighboring nodes at time @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : scatt_scalar ] ) .    since our aim is to describe the two chiral fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 , two kinds of currents , @xmath26 and @xmath27 currents , are naturally introduced , leading to four currents propagating simultaneously on each bond . for clarity",
    ", the one - dimensional lattice can be pictured by two sublattices carrying the @xmath26 and @xmath27 currents respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modele_maj1 ] ) .    due to the structure of the dirac equation  ( [ eq : contdirac ] ) which displays a coupling term between the two chiral components @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 , we also introduce additional currents which propagate between the two sublattices in one time step as depicted in figure  [ fig : modele_maj2 ] .    these additional currents , which are called the @xmath26 or @xmath27 node - current in the following , do not propagate along the chain but remain located on the same node .",
    "they can be considered as propagating along a internal time axis which couples the @xmath26 and @xmath27 sublattices at each node of the chain . moreover , these node currents participate in the same scattering process as the propagating currents ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modele_maj3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the scattering process reads    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the complex entries of the scattering matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 attached to each node .",
    "the ensemble of all the scattering matrices belonging to the chain defines the medium or the `` background '' in which the currents live .",
    "once the scattering matrices are known , the evolution of the system at any time is completely determined given any initial values of the currents . throughout the paper",
    "the scattering matrices are chosen to be identical from node to node indicating that the medium is uniform .",
    "however , the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 do not need to be identical .",
    "the dynamics includes all the features of a discrete counterpart of the well - known huygens principle .",
    "namely , the principle of action - by - proximity from one node to the nearest - neighboring nodes is taken into account by the propagation step , while the interferences and the radiation of the energy in all directions are taken into account by the scattering process .",
    "let us introduce some convenient notations .",
    "the bonds attached to a given node are numbered as displayed in figure  [ fig : modele_maj3 ] : @xmath33 for the left bond , @xmath34 for the right bond and @xmath35 for the node bond .",
    "now consider a current @xmath36 leaving the node @xmath37 along the bond @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : def_bond ] ) . at the next time step",
    ", this current becomes an input current @xmath40 on the neighbor node along the @xmath41 direction .",
    "this neighbor node is labelled @xmath42 .",
    "note that this notation implies @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , viewed from node @xmath42 , the bond on which lies the input current @xmath40 is denoted @xmath44 , leading to labelling this current as @xmath45 .",
    "this notation implies @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "hence , the relations linking the outgoing and the incident currents during the propagation step read    @xmath49    the propagation rules ( [ eq : proprule_chiral2 ] ) take into account a transmutation of the node currents @xmath50 and @xmath51 into @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively . figure  [ fig : difprop_chiral ] summarizes the two steps defining the dynamics of the @xmath54 currents .    to pursue the construction of the dirac equation within this two - species current model , the chiral fields need to be defined .",
    "the fields @xmath24 , @xmath25 are complex valued functions which are defined on the nodes of the chain .",
    "the linearity of the problem compels the choice for each chiral field @xmath24 or @xmath25 to be a linear superposition of the @xmath26 or @xmath27 currents respectively . as the outgoing currents can be expressed as a function of the incident currents according to the scattering equations  ( [ eq : scatt_majl ] ) , ( [ eq : scatt_majr ] ) it is sufficient to define the chiral fields in terms of the incident currents solely  :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 are complex numbers .      [ eq_maj ] under certain assumptions , which we call thereafter closure conditions , we show that the two chiral fields , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , satisfy the following discrete propagation equations    @xmath58    where the fields , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , on node @xmath37 and at time @xmath20 are functions of both chiral fields on the same node and/or on nodes @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , at previous times @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath61 equations ( [ eq : wave_field_l ] ) , ( [ eq : wave_field_r ] ) are closed equations in the fields",
    "this means that @xmath64 are functions involving the two chiral fields only and do not depend explicitly on the incident currents of both kinds .",
    "moreover , the number of terms in the right hand side of equations  ( [ eq : wave_field_l ] ) , ( [ eq : wave_field_r ] ) must be finite .",
    "those two closure conditions strongly constrain the form of the scattering matrices @xmath65 , so that one finds    @xmath66    where    @xmath67    and @xmath68 denotes the complex numbers appearing in the definitions of the chiral fields .",
    "the @xmath69 and @xmath70 are complex numbers to be determined . as usual @xmath71",
    "denotes a diagonal matrix .",
    "the discussion leading to the form  ( [ def : chiral_scatt_a ] ) , ( [ def : chiral_scatt_b ] ) of the scattering matrices is exactly the same as for scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have only quoted the result here . according to equations  ( [ def : chiral_scatt_a ] ) and  ( [ def : chiral_scatt_b ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to check that the outgoing current @xmath72 for each species splits into a term proportional to the incident current @xmath73 of the same kind on the same bond @xmath38 and into a term proportional to the field of the same kind    @xmath74    as the constructions of the equations  ( [ eq : wave_field_l ] ) , ( [ eq : wave_field_r ] ) obeyed by @xmath75 and @xmath76 are carried out in the same way , we only consider the equation for @xmath24 in the following .",
    "an analogous equation can be derived for the field @xmath25 .",
    "we fix the space - time units , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , to unity .",
    "let us consider the @xmath26 field on node @xmath37 at time @xmath77 which is defined as ( eq .

    "for example , the definition of the @xmath26 field ( eq .",
    "( [ def : chiral_comp_a ] ) ) , @xmath80 , is represented schematically as sketched below    whereas equation ( [ eq : psil_int_1 ] ) is sketched    at time @xmath11 , the outgoing bond currents appearing in equation ( [ eq : psil_int_1 ] ) were instantaneously scattered by @xmath31 matrices .",
    "hence , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are linear superpositions of @xmath26 incident currents on nodes @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively , whereas @xmath51 is scattered by an @xmath32 matrix on node @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting linear superpositions are given by the specific form ( [ eq : outcurrent ] ) .",
    "schematically , this scattering process is represented as follows    which reads analytically    @xmath85    according to the propagation step , the current term of equation ( [ eq : psil_int_2 ] ) , which is the sum involving only the incident currents and not the chiral fields , is deduced from three outgoing currents at time @xmath86 .",
    "those outgoing currents are all defined on node @xmath37 , as sketched in figure [ fig : prop_chiral ]    which translates analytically through the following equation    @xmath87    again , the outgoing currents appearing in the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : psil_int_3 ] ) are deduced from incident currents on the same node according to the scattering process  ( [ eq : outcurrent ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following equation    @xmath88    the new current term in the last equation is schematically depicted in figure  [ fig : psil_3mod ]    plugging the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : psil_int_4 ] ) into equation ( [ eq : psil_int_2 ] ) leads to    @xmath89    equation  ( [ eq : psil_int_5 ] ) is almost in the closed form we are looking for but still contains a current term . in order to get an equation which involves solely @xmath54 fields without any @xmath54 currents , it is sufficient to impose the following relations    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is a constant parameter .",
    "the relations  ( [ eq : condsufl ] ) have been chosen in such a way that the last term of equation ( [ eq : psil_int_5 ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "the insertion of equations  ( [ eq : condsufl ] ) into  ( [ eq : psil_int_5 ] ) leads to a discrete propagation equation of the type of equation ( [ eq : wave_field_l ] )  :    @xmath93    the discrete propagation equation obeyed by the @xmath27 field is directly deduced from the equation for the @xmath26 field by exchanging all the subscripts @xmath26 and @xmath27  :    @xmath94    where equation ( [ eq : field_r ] ) has been supplemented by sufficient conditions of the type of equations ( [ eq : condsufl ] )    @xmath95    the comparison of the second equations in both systems  ( [ eq : condsufl ] ) , ( [ eq : condsufr ] ) leads to the equality  : @xmath96 . in the rest of this section , we will denote this constant by @xmath97 .",
    "now , if the matrix parameters appearing in equations ( [ eq : field_l ] ) , ( [ eq : field_r ] ) are chosen according to the following relations    @xmath98    then a first - order discretized time derivative appears    @xmath99    on the same ground , the sums @xmath100 entering equations ( [ eq : field_lmod1 ] ) , ( [ eq : field_rmod1 ] ) can be turned into first - order discretized spatial derivatives by an appropriate choice of the products @xmath101 , for @xmath102 . with this assumption ,",
    "the two coupled discretized wave propagation equations ( [ eq : field_lmod1 ] ) , ( [ eq : field_rmod1 ] ) can be identified with the dirac equation in the majorana - weyl representation .",
    "however , we do nt need this last assumption at this step of our derivation . in the next section",
    "we show that implementing some suitable symmetries on the scattering process constrains even more the @xmath54 matrix coefficients and turns the terms @xmath100 into first - order discretized spatial derivatives .",
    "[ symet_maj ] our goal is now to prove that a few well chosen assumptions on the symmetries of the scattering process leads to the unique determination of the @xmath54 scattering matrices and to the discrete propagation equations ( [ eq : field_lmod1 ] ) , ( [ eq : field_rmod1 ] ) in a form very close to the dirac equation ( [ eq : contdirac ] ) .",
    "the symmetries are implemented both on the currents and on the fields . in this model ,",
    "the scattering process is described by matrices which are unitary due to time - reversal invariance and reciprocity .",
    "this property insures the local conservation , at each time step , of the `` flux '' of the @xmath54 currents  : @xmath103 , which is a stability condition on the dynamics of the @xmath54 fields at large times .",
    "finally , the last symmetry required to complete the construction is reflection symmetry ( @xmath104 ) which is known to connect the two chiral fields .",
    "time - reversal invariance for the currents can be formulated by stating that the two scattering processes , sketched in figure [ fig : it_chiral ] , are equivalent under a time - reversal transformation    note that the @xmath26 and @xmath27 currents are exchanged in this transformation .",
    "this corresponds to the exchange of the spinor components @xmath24 and @xmath25 when considering the time - reversal transformation in the dirac equation .",
