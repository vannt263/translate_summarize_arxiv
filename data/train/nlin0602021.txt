    "elucidating cooperative behavior of synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators has important biological implications and potential engineering applications from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints , and it is also essential for the understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms at both molecular and cellular levels . so far many researchers have studied the synchronization in genetic networks from the aspects of experiment , numerical simulation and theoretical analysis . for instance , in @xcite , the authors experimentally investigated the synchronization of cellular clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) ; in @xcite and @xcite , the collective dynamics of synchronization are theoretically studied in synthetic biological networks of identical genetic oscillators ; and in @xcite , the mechanism of synchronization in a population of identical hysteretic genetic oscillators is analyzed .",
    "biologically , the genetic oscillators , even in the same species , are usually nonidentical possibly due to asymmetrical nutrition conditions and fluctuated environments , and the nonidentical property can be modelled as parametric mismatches among oscillators .",
    "for example , in the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) , the periods of the circadian oscillators are not exactly the same , and it has been observed that isolated individual neurons are able to produce circadian oscillations with period ranging from 20 to 28 hours @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the synchronization for nonidentical genetic oscillators is examined numerically .",
    "although many mathematical models have been developed to study the cooperative behaviors of cellular oscillation , there is no general theoretical method in analyzing the dynamics of the coupled genetic oscillators due to their inherent nonlinearity .",
    "genetic networks are biochemically dynamical systems , in which the nodes indicate the biochemicals , and the couplings represent the biochemical interactions @xcite .",
    "mathematically many genetic oscillators can be expressed in the form of multiple additive terms , each of which particularly is of linear , michaelis - menten or hill forms , such as the well - known goodwin model @xcite , repressilator @xcite , toggle switch @xcite , and the circadian oscillators @xcite . from the synthetic biology viewpoint , genetic oscillators with only linear , michaelis - menten and hill form terms",
    "can also be implemented easily . in this paper",
    "we explore such special structure of gene networks to show that these genetic oscillators can be transformed into lure form and can be further analyzed by using lure system method in control theory @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a general theoretical method for analyzing the synchronization of coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators with the above - mentioned structure . in studying the synchronization of genetic oscillators ( and other nonlinear systems ) , a general idea is to study the stability of the error equations among oscillators .",
    "however , there are two main difficulties for such method : ( 1 ) the difference of the oscillator dynamics usually can not be written into a function of the state error ; ( 2 ) due to the nonlinearity , there is no general efficient analysis method for the stability of the error system .",
    "we show in this paper that for genetic oscillators with the above - mentioned structure , we can overcome both of the above difficulties .",
    "since coupled nonidentical oscillators usually can not achieve complete synchronization , a synchronous error is required to evaluate the quality of the synchronization . in this paper , we present a theoretical result , which can not only guarantee the synchronization , but also estimates the bound of the synchronization error . besides , the obtained conditions can be represented in terms of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) @xcite , which are very easy to be verified .",
    "recently , it was found that many biological networks are complex networks with small - world and scale - free properties @xcite .",
    "our method is also applicable to genetic oscillator networks with complex topology , directed and weighted couplings . to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results , we present two simulation examples of coupled goodwin oscillators with linear and michaelis - menten couplings , respectively . finally , several remarks on the extensions of the proposed method are discussed .",
    "notation used in this paper as well as the detailed theoretical analysis are given in the appendix .",
    "mathematical modelling provides a powerful tool for studying gene regulation processes in living organisms . basically , there are two types of genetic network models , i.e. , the boolean model ( or discrete model ) and the differential equation model ( or continuous model ) @xcite . in boolean models ,",
    "the activity of each gene is expressed in one of two states , on or off , and the state of a gene is determined by a boolean function of the states of other related genes . in the differential equation models ,",
    "the variables describe the concentrations of gene products , such as mrnas and proteins , as continuous values , which are more accurate and can provide detailed understanding of the dynamical behaviors of the gene regulation systems . in this paper , by adopting the differential equation models , we consider the following form of a general genetic oscillator : @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the concentrations of proteins , rnas and chemical complexes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are matrices in @xmath4 , @xmath5^t$ ] with @xmath6 as a monotonic increasing or decreasing regulatory function , which usually is of the michaelis - menten or hill form . undoubtedly , many well - known genetic system models can be represented in this form , such as the goodwin model @xcite , the repressilator @xcite , the toggle switch @xcite , and the circadian oscillators @xcite . in synthetic biology , genetic oscillators of this form can be implemented experimentally @xcite . to make our method more understandable and to avoid unnecessarily complicated notation , we consider the following simplified model , in which there are only one increasing and one decreasing nonlinear terms in each equation of the genetic oscillator .",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 includes the degradation terms and all the other linear terms in the genetic oscillator , @xmath9^t$ ] with @xmath10 as a monotonic increasing function of the hill form @xmath11 and @xmath12^t$ ] with @xmath13 as a monotonic decreasing function of the following form @xmath14 in the above equations , both @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the hill coefficients . to avoid confusion , we let the @xmath17th column of @xmath18 be zeros if @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 by letting @xmath21 , we can rewrite ( 2 ) as follows : @xmath22 obviously , @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfy the following sector conditions @xmath25 or equivalently , @xmath26",
    "\\leq 0,\\\\ ( g_i(a)-g_i(b))[(g_i(a)-g_i(b))-k_{2i}(a - b ) ] \\leq 0,\\\\ \\forall a , b\\in r\\ , ( a\\neq b ) ; i=1,\\cdots , n , \\end{array}\\ ] ] it follows from the mean value theorem that for differentiable @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the above sector conditions correspond to @xmath27    recall that a lure system is a linear dynamic system , feedback interconnected to a static nonlinearity @xmath28 that satisfies a sector condition @xcite .",
    "hence , the genetic oscillator ( 3 ) can be seen as a lure system , which can be investigated by using the fruitful lure system method in control theory . in the following ,",
    "we first consider coupled identical genetic oscillators , and then extend the result to the nonidentical case .",
    "we first analyze the following @xmath29 linearly coupled genetic oscillators , in which each genetic oscillator is identical .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the state vector of the @xmath32th genetic oscillator ( corresponds to @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) , @xmath34 defines the coupling between two genetic oscillators .",
    "@xmath35 is the coupling matrix of the network , in which @xmath36 is defined as follows : if there is a link from oscillator @xmath17 to oscillator @xmath32 @xmath37 , then @xmath36 equals to a positive constant denoting the coupling strength of this link ; otherwise , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 .",
    "matrix @xmath40 defines the coupling topology , direction , and the coupling strength of the network .",
    "since in biological networks , the genetic oscillators are usually nonidentical , there are parametric mismatches among oscillators .",
    "next , we consider the following network of @xmath29 coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the mismatch matrices , which can be time - varying .",
    "we assume that the mismatch matrices @xmath43 can be estimated by the following bounds , which are also reasonable for general biological systems .",
    "@xmath44 we also assume that @xmath45 since in genetic oscillators , @xmath46 usually denotes the concentrations of _ m_rna , protein , neurotransmitter , etc .",
    ", which are of limited values , and @xmath28 and @xmath47 are usually monotonic functions with saturated values , the above assumptions are also reasonable .",
    "the other parameters are defined as the same as those in the identical case .    for the above two network ,",
    "i.e. eq . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we mainly use wu s method to analyze the synchronization @xcite , which can separate the effects of the coupling and the individual genetic oscillator dynamics . based on lyapunov method ,",
    "we can obtain the following sufficient conditions for the synchronization of coupled identical genetic oscillators ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) ) and coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators ( eq .",

    "is defined as an irreducible matrices with zero row sums , whose off - diagonal elements are all non - positive . @xmath51 and",

    "theorem 2 _ : if there are matrices @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and a positive real constant @xmath61 such that the following matrix inequalities hold @xmath62<0,\\\\ ( ug\\otimes pd+u\\otimes q)^t+(ug\\otimes pd+u\\otimes q)\\leq 0 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] then the network ( 7 ) is asymptotically synchronous with error bound @xmath63 where @xmath64    the proof of the above theorems are somewhat technical , and we defer the details to the appendix . in theorem 2 , we not only give a sufficient condition for the synchronization , but also provide an estimation of the synchronization error bound .",
    "in this error bound estimation , we can select the form of the matrix @xmath65 beforehand to obtain different error combinations . specifically ,",
    "if we choose the following form of @xmath65 @xmath66\\ ] ] we can obtain the following synchronous error estimation : @xmath67    it should be note that , since in each step , we used conservative estimations of the bounds , the estimated error bound may be much larger than the actual error .",
    "in other words , if accurate information on the parametric mismatches is known , we can have a better error estimation .",
    "the first matrix inequality in ( 8) ( or ( 9 ) ) is an lmi , which can be easily verified by using convex optimization techniques , e.g. , the interior point method @xcite , and by software packages , e.g. , the matlab lmi toolbox . if we choose the matrix @xmath65 beforehand , the second matrix inequality in ( 8) ( or ( 9 ) ) is also an lmi .",
    "furthermore , for two special cases , we have the following results @xcite :    \\(1 ) when @xmath40 is symmetric : letting @xmath68 , the second matrix inequality in ( 8) ( or ( 9 ) ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 which is equivalent to @xmath70    \\(2 ) when @xmath71 is symmetric and commutable with @xmath40 : letting @xmath72 , the second matrix inequality in ( 8) ( or ( 9 ) ) can be rewritten as @xmath73 which is equivalent to @xmath74    thus the second matrix inequality in ( 8) ( or ( 9 ) ) is also a lower dimensional lmi , which together with the first lmi can be verified easily .",
    "next , we use numerical examples to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results .",
    "to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical methods , we study a population of coupled scn neuron model oscillators .",
    "the single cell or genetic oscillator is described by the classical goodwin model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a clock gene mrna ( @xmath75 ) produces a clock protein ( @xmath76 ) , which activates a transcriptional inhibitor ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "@xmath77 inhibits the transcription of the clock gene , thus forming a negative feedback loop . in this paper",

    "similar to @xcite , the evolution equations for a network of @xmath29 coupled nonidentical oscillators are given below : @xmath79 where @xmath80 are positive constants , and @xmath81 is the coupling strength .",
    "the variables @xmath82 describe the dynamics of the oscillator in the @xmath32th neuron , and @xmath83 describes the evolution of the neurotransmitter in the @xmath32th neuron .",
    "the release of the neurotransmitter is supposed to be fast with respect to the 24-h timescale of the oscillators and becomes homogeneous to establish an average neurotransmitter level , or a mean field @xmath84",
    "@xcite @xmath85    clearly , the individual goodwin model is of the form ( 3 ) , in which @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88^t$ ] , @xmath89 is a @xmath90 matrix with all zero entries except for @xmath91 , and all the other terms are in the linear form . by plus and minus",
    "@xmath92 in the first equation of ( 10 ) , we can get the coupling term @xmath93 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical method , instead of mimicking the real scns .",
    "we consider a small size of network with @xmath94 coupled oscillators , although there are @xmath95 neurons in the scns .",
    "the concentrations are expressed in @xmath96 , and the standard parameters are set as @xmath97 for all @xmath32 , so that the period of the oscillator is approximately 24h , and the coupling strength is @xmath98 .",
    "it is known that the period of the goodwin model is sensitive to the parameters @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the mismatches of @xmath99 are randomly distributed in @xmath100 around the above values of @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "1 , when starting from the same initial values , we show the oscillation dynamics of the mrna concentrations of the 10 uncoupled oscillators , which indicate that the periods of the oscillators are quite different . submitting the above parameters to the corresponding matrices in the matrix inequalities ( 9 ) of theorem 2 , letting @xmath68 and using matlab lmi toolbox , we can easily find feasible solutions for ( 9 ) , which indicate that the above all - to - all coupled network can achieve synchronization although it is not a complete synchronous state . in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) , when starting from different initial values , we plot the time evolution of the mrna concentrations ( @xmath101 ) of all the oscillators . fig . 2 ( b ) shows the synchronization error @xmath102.\\ ] ] which is gradually reduced with time evolution .",
    "since there is a maximal activity of fully active promoters , in @xcite , the authors considered a michaelis - menten form of coupling term , that is , in ( 10 ) replacing @xmath103 by @xmath104 .",
    "our theoretical results in theorems 1 and 2 are also applicable for this case .",
    "specifically , we may have different methods to treat the coupling term .",
    "one of the simplest ways is explained as follows : since the coupling term @xmath104 is the same for all oscillators and @xmath65 is zero row sums , it is easy to show that the product of @xmath105 and the vector of the coupling terms ( containing the coupling terms of all the oscillators ) is zero . by using the same analysis as that of theorem 2 , it is easy to show that the synchronization condition is only the first lmi in theorem 2 with @xmath106 . for the michaelis - menten coupling , figs .",
    "3 ( a ) and 3 ( b ) show the time evolution of the @xmath107rna concentrations and the synchronization error , respectively . figs .",
    "2 and 3 indicate that the coupled oscillators are indeed synchronized with small error bounds , which confirms the theoretical results .",
    "in this paper , we presented a theoretical method for analyzing the synchronization of coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators based on control theory approach .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not to provide a general theory for all genetic oscillator networks , but provide an efficient method for genetic oscillator networks that can be expressed in the form of ( 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the sufficient conditions for the synchronization were also derived based on lmi formalism , which can be easily verified numerically . although the method is proposed for genetic oscillator networks ,",
    "it is also applicable to other biochemical and neuronal networks of the form . to make the theoretical method more understandable and to avoid unnecessarily complicated notation , we discussed only on some simplified forms of the genetic oscillators , but more general cases and extensions regarding this topic can be studied in a similar way , for example :    1 .   the theoretical results can be easily extended to the general form of genetic oscillators with more than 2 nonlinear terms in each equation as shown in ( 1 ) .",
    "2 .   the genetic oscillator model ( 3 )",
    "can be extended to a more general case such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , the components of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , are functions of @xmath33 , instead of @xmath112 . for this case",
    ", we only require that @xmath113 where @xmath114 are arbitrary nonzero real vectors .",
    "moreover , @xmath108 and @xmath109 can be of more complex forms ( non - hill form ) and non - differentiable provided that they satisfy sector conditions .",
    "genetic oscillators who have a few terms that are not in linear , michaelis - menten and hill forms , can also be analyzed similarly by using our method .",
    "for example , in the mammalian circadian clock model @xcite , there are a few product terms ( of the form @xmath115 ) besides the three kinds of terms .",
    "we can treat these terms as follows : since @xmath116 then we can treat these terms similarly as those that satisfies the sector condition .",
    "although such manipulation introduces additional conservation , the conservation is assumed to be limited since most terms in the model are of the three kind of terms .",
    "in addition to the nonlinear and coupling properties , genetic networks are intrinsically noisy @xcite , and with significant time delays @xcite .",
    "future works regarding this topic also include the extension of our method to the case with noise perturbations and time delays .",

    "<S> the study on the collective dynamics of synchronization among genetic oscillators is essential for the understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms at both molecular and cellular levels . </S>",
    "<S> genetic oscillators are biochemical networks , which can generally be modelled as nonlinear dynamic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show in this paper that many genetic oscillators can be transformed into lure form by exploiting the special structure of biological systems . by using control theory approach </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a theoretical method for analyzing the synchronization of coupled nonidentical genetic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> sufficient conditions for the synchronization as well as the estimation of the bound of the synchronization error are also obtained . to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results , a population of genetic oscillators based on the goodwin model </S>",
    "<S> are adopted as numerical examples . </S>"
