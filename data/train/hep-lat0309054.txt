    "most studies of lattice field theory are performed in the well - known _ lagrangian _ formalism , discretizing both space and time .",
    "we feel that it is important not to neglect the _ hamiltonian _ formalism @xcite , which affords , e.g. , a more immediate approach to the mass spectrum and to the implementation of fermions ; numerical methods are quite different in the lagrangian and in hamiltonian formalism , and comparison between the two can provide important test of the methods as well as of universality .",
    "we chose to study an hamiltonian lattice version of the two - dimensional wess - zumino model , described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the model enjoys an exact 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebra @xmath0 , which suffices to preserve a few key properties of the continuum model ( which has a full 2-dimensional supersymmetry ) : the energy spectrum is non - negative ; states of nonzero energy appear in boson - fermion doublets ; spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is equivalent to a strictly positive ground - state energy @xmath1 .",
    "the model is parametrized by the _ prepotential _ , an arbitrary polynomial in the bosonic field @xmath2 ; the model is superrenormalizable , and the only renormalization needed is the normal ordering of @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the strong - coupling expansion predicts supersymmetry breaking if and only if the degree of the prepotential @xmath3 is even , while perturbation theory predicts supersymmetry breaking if and only if @xmath3 has no zeroes ; the two contitions are quite different in the case , e.g. , of quadratic @xmath3 , and it is interesting to study the crossover from strong to weak coupling .",
    "a standard numerical simulation technique that can be applied to the model we are interested in is the green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the interested reader may find a description of gfmc applied to the present problem in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we only remark here that the gfmc algorithm generates a stochastic representation of the ground - state wavefunction , from which expectation values of observables can be computed ; the variance of observables can be kept under control by the introduction of a population of @xmath4 _ walkers _ ( field configurations ) , and an extrapolation to @xmath5 of the result is required .    another numerical approach which has been applied with success to 1-dimensional hamiltonian models is the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite ; the parameters of the algorithm are the dimension @xmath6 to which the local ( 1-site ) hilbert space is truncated , and the number @xmath7 of eigenstates of the density matrix of the full system that are retained ; extrapolation to @xmath8 and @xmath9 is needed .",
    "dmrg is a deterministic algorithm and does not suffer from the sign problem ; it is possible to obtain directly infinite - volume results .",
    "the most interesting property of the model is the pattern of supersymmetry breaking , especially in the case of quadratic prepotential ; we study the case of even prepotential @xmath10 , for which the strong - coupling expansion predicts supersymmetry breaking for all values of @xmath11 , while perturbation theory predicts unbroken supersymmetry for @xmath12 .",
    "the model enjoys an approximate @xmath13 , @xmath14 symmetry ( `` parity '' ) ; supersymmetry breaking is incompatible with parity breaking  @xcite , and it is reasonable to expect only two phases : unbroken supersymmetry and broken parity for @xmath15 , broken supersymmetry and unbroken parity for @xmath16 .",
    "an analysis of the approach to the continuum limit , along a trajectory of `` constant physics '' in the phase of broken supersymmetry was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper , we study the model varying @xmath11 at fixed @xmath17 .",
    "we monitor supersymmetry breaking by looking at the ground - state energy density @xmath18 .",
    "infinite - volume dmrg results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg_e0 ] ; we remind that they must be extrapolated to @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "gfmc results are extrapolated to @xmath19 and @xmath5 by a best fit to the form @xmath20 which gives a good @xmath21 ( at least for @xmath22 ) ; the fit gives @xmath23 , signaling a slow convergence to @xmath5 ( to stabilize the fit , we ran with @xmath4 up to 5000 for our smallest lattice @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfmc_e0 ] , together with dmrg results for the highest values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; the agreement is remarkable .",
    "we study parity symmetry breaking looking at the binder cumulant @xmath26 where the sum excludes sites closer to the border than ( typically ) 6 ; a good estimate of the transition point is the intersection of the curves @xmath27 vs.  @xmath11 obtained at different values of @xmath28 .",
    "gfmc results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : b_k200 ] and [ fig : b_k500 ] ; they are quite sensitive to @xmath4 and not very precise .",
    "therefore , we follow a different strategy and consider the connected correlation function @xmath29 averaged over all @xmath30 pairs with @xmath31 , excluding pairs for which @xmath32 or @xmath33 is closer to the border than ( typically ) 6 ; since we are using staggered fermions , even and odd @xmath34 may correspond to different physical channels .",
    "the correlation function is quite different in the two phases : for @xmath35 , there is a marked difference between even and odd distances , and @xmath36 is short - ranged ; for @xmath37 , even and odd distances are equivalent , and @xmath36 appears to be long - ranged .",
    "we fit @xmath36 to the form @xmath38 , separately for even and odd @xmath34 ; the best fits give a good @xmath21 if we remove the smallest distances , typically @xmath39 for the odd channel and @xmath40 for the even channel .",
    "the difference between the two phases is apparent , e.g. , in the plot of @xmath41 vs.   @xmath11 , presented in fig .",
