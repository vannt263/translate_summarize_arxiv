    "bosonic open string field theory ( sft ) possesses classical solutions describing a tachyon vacuum where d - branes with attached open strings completely annihilate .",
    "a numerical tachyon vacuum solution was first constructed using level truncation approximation in the siegel gauge @xcite .",
    "then , an analytic classical solution has been constructed by schnabl @xcite and it has been found that the solution has several properties of the tachyon vacuum .",
    "the vacuum energy of the nontrivial analytic solution exactly cancels the d - brane tension , and the cohomology of the kinetic operator around the vacuum is trivial @xcite .    in sft",
    ", there is another type of analytic solution that was constructed earlier on the basis of the identity string field instead of wedge states used in schnabl s solution @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an identity - based solution discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite has some properties of the tachyon vacuum .",
    "moreover , for the identity - based solution , there is a possibility of understanding the existence of closed strings on the tachyon vacuum .    in  2",
    ", we will briefly summarize the identity - based solution .",
    "in  3 and  4 , we will present new results for vacuum structure around the identity - based solution @xcite .",
    "then , we propose that the solution can be regarded as the analytic tachyon vacuum solution .",
    "the identity - based solution can be expressed as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the identity string field associated with the star product , and the half string operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined using the brst current @xmath7 and ghost field @xmath8 as follows , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes the contour along a right semi - unit circle from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , which conventionally corresponds to the left half of strings . the function @xmath13 is defined on the whole unit circle . for the function",
    "@xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the equations of motion , @xmath16 , hold .",
    "hereafter , we consider the identity - based solution derived from the function @xmath17 where @xmath18 . for the solution to satisfy the reality condition , the parameter @xmath19 is larger than or equal to @xmath20 .",
    "this function gives the simplest example to capture typical feature of the identity - based solution .",
    "\\i ) it has a well - defined universal fock space expression : if we expand the solution by fock space states @xmath21 the coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are finite for all @xmath19 .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath1 , the solution can be expressed as a pure gauge form connecting to a trivial configuration , but at @xmath2 , the solution can be given as a type of singular gauge transformation of the trivial configuration @xcite : we can rewrite the solution for generic @xmath19 as @xmath25 but @xmath26 becomes singular at @xmath2 .",
    "these facts suggest that the solution for @xmath1 is a trivial pure gauge , but it becomes a non - trivial configuration at @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , if we expand the string field as @xmath27 , we can obtain the action for the fluctuation around the identity - based solution . in the expanded theory ,",
    "the kinetic operator can be written as @xmath28 where we expand the brst current and ghost field as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the following facts have been known for the expanded theory for @xmath1 :    1 .",
    "the action obtained by expanding around the solution can be transformed back to the action with the original brst charge @xcite .",
    "2 .   the new brst charge gives rise to the cohomology , which has one - to - one correspondence to the cohomology of the original brst charge @xcite .",
    "3 .   the expanded theory reproduces ordinary open string amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these are consistent with the expectation that the solution for @xmath1 corresponds to a trivial pure gauge . on the other hand",
    ", we find completely different properties in the expanded theory around the solution with @xmath2 :    1 .",
    "the new brst charge has vanishing cohomology in the hilbert space with the ghost number one @xcite .",
    "2 .   the open string scattering amplitudes vanish and the result is consistent with the absence of open string excitations @xcite .    from these facts",
    ", it would be reasonable to expect that the identity - based solution at @xmath2 indeed corresponds to the tachyon vacuum solution .",
    "hence , we expect that the identity - based solution corresponds to a trivial pure gauge form for almost all the parameter region and it can be regarded as the tachyon vacuum solution at @xmath2 .    to prove our conjecture , we have to calculate the vacuum energy of the identity - based solution directly .",
    "formally , the vacuum energy can be calculated as @xmath31 namely , the vacuum energy is given as an indefinite quantity . to calculate the vacuum energy ,",
    "it is necessary to apply a kind of canonical regularization to fix the ambiguity .",
    "indeed , the level can be regarded as a regularization parameter for the numerical solution in the siegel gauge .",
    "hence , the difficulty of calculating the vacuum energy seems to arise from the lack of such a regularization method for the identity - based solution .",
    "however , we can provide indirect evidence that supports the possibility of calculating the vacuum energy .",
    "the vacuum structure in the theory expanded around the identity - based solution has been analyzed using level truncation approximation and then we have found the following results :    1 .",
    "a numerical analysis shows that the nonperturbative vacuum found for @xmath1 disappears as @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "2 .   the energy of the nonperturbative vacuum for @xmath1 becomes closer to the value appropriate to cancel the d - brane tension as the truncation level increases @xcite .",
    "these imply that the theory around the identity - based solution for @xmath1 has the tachyon vacuum , but the theory at @xmath2 is stable . from consistency with the theory before expanding a string field , it follows that the vacuum energy of the identity - based solution itself is zero for @xmath1 and it is equal to the tachyon vacuum energy at @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the tachyon vacuum in the expanded theory around the identity - based solution .",
    "the expanded theory has a gauge symmetry under @xmath32 where @xmath33 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : expkin ] ) . to find classical solutions in the theory , we impose the siegel gauge condition on the fluctuation string field ; @xmath34 . under the siegel gauge condition",
    ", the potential can be expressed as @xmath35 where it is normalized as @xmath36 for the tachyon vacuum solution at @xmath37 . here",
    ", the operator @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a total virasoro generator and @xmath41 is a mode of the ghost number current .. it can be rewritten only using ghost twisted virasoro operators as in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "if the identity - based solution corresponds to a trivial pure gauge for @xmath1 and then to the tachyon vacuum for @xmath2 , the potential ( [ eq : expaction ] ) should be illustrated as in fig .",
    "[ fig : vac ] . for @xmath1 , the tachyon vacuum configuration @xmath42 should minimize the potential , since the expanded theory for @xmath43 is still the theory on the perturbative open string vacuum .",

    "in addition , the theory at @xmath2 should have an unstable solution corresponding to the perturbative open string vacuum of the unexpanded original theory .",
    ", the theory should have a nontrivial vacuum solution , the vacuum energy of which cancels the d - brane tension .",

    "then , the vacuum energy @xmath45 is given as a function of the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "if the potential has such a structure as previously expected , the vacuum energy is @xmath36 for @xmath1 but the solution @xmath42 becomes trivial and therefore its vacuum energy annihilates at @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vacenergy1 ] ) .",
    ".,width=188 ]    now , let us consider the stable solution @xmath42 by level truncation calculation to confirm the above conjecture .",
    "since the level truncation is a good approximation , the vacuum energy for the truncated solution is considered to approach the step function in fig .",

    "we apply an iterative approximation algorithm as used in refs .",

    "[ fig : vacenergy2 ] . we can find that , for various @xmath19 , the resulting plots approach the tachyon vacuum energy @xmath36 as the truncation level is increased .",
    "then , for decreasing @xmath19 to @xmath20 , the vacuum energy increases rapidly to zero from @xmath36 . as a whole , the plots become closer to the step function as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacenergy1 ] as the truncation level increases .",
    "these results support our expectation for the vacuum structure associated with the stable solution @xmath42 .",

    ", the vacuum energy of the unstable solution should be equal to the d - brane tension ( not the _ minus _ d - brane tension ) .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy of @xmath46 is expected to behave as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vacenergy4 ] .",
    "@xmath47 is trivially zero for @xmath1 , but it should be increased to @xmath48 owing to the emergence of the unstable solution at @xmath2 .",

    "the vacuum energy is about 19% over , although it is about 260% at level @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , the gauge invariant overlap also takes around the expected value of @xmath36 .",
    "these results suggest that the level truncation approximation is also applicable to the analysis of the unstable solution .",

    "for these solutions , we have evaluated the vacuum energy in terms of level truncation approximation up to level @xmath49 . in our paper @xcite , we have also evaluated the gauge invariant overlap for these solutions . as the truncation level is increased , the plots of the gauge invariants for the parameter @xmath19 become remarkably closer to the behavior expected from the vacuum structure in fig .",
