    "[ sect.i ] for its simplicity and predictive power , the light - front constituent quark model(lfqm ) appears to be a useful phenomenological tool to study various electroweak properties of mesons  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the light - front(lf ) quantization  @xcite is essentially attributed to the suppression of the vacuum fluctuations with the decoupling of complicated zero - modes and the conversion of the dynamical problem from boost to rotation .",
    "the suppression of vacuum fluctuations is due to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation which correlates the signs of the lf energy @xmath6 and the lf momentum @xmath7 .",
    "however , the zero - mode(@xmath8 ) complication in the matrix element has been noticed for the electroweak form factors involving a spin-1 particle@xcite .",
    "a growing concern  @xcite is to pin down which form factors get the zero - mode contributions .",
    "the zero - mode contributions can be interpreted as residues of virtual pair creation processes in the @xmath9 limit  @xcite . in the absence of zero - mode contributions",
    ", the hadron form factors can be obtained rather straightforwardly by just taking into account only the valence contributions ( or the diagonal matrix elements in the lf fock - state expansion ) .",
    "thus , it is quite significant to resolve the issue related to the zero - mode contribution to the hadron form factors .    in an effort to clarify this issue , jaus  @xcite and we  @xcite independently investigated the spin-1 electroweak form factors in the past few years .",
    "jaus  @xcite proposed a covariant lf approach involving the lightlike four vector @xmath10 as a variable and developed a way of finding the zero - mode contribution to remove the spurious amplitudes proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "our formulation , however , is intrinsically distinguished from this @xmath12-dependent formulation since it involves neither @xmath11 nor any unphysical form factors .",
    "our method of finding the zero - mode contribution is a direct power - counting of the longitudinal momentum fraction in @xmath13 limit for the off - diagonal elements in the fock - state expansion of the current matrix@xcite .",
    "since the longitudinal momentum fraction is one of the integration variables in the lf matrix elements ( _ i.e. _ helicity amplitudes ) , our power - counting method is straightforward as far as we know the behaviors of the longitudinal momentum fraction in the integrand .",
    "when the manifestly covariant model for the vector meson vertex @xmath14 is available , we have confirmed that the results found our way coincide with the ones from the manifestly covariant calculation .    for a rather simple ( manifestly covariant ) vertex @xmath15 , both jaus and we agree on the absence of zero - mode contributions to the spin-1 electroweak form factors .",
    "however , jaus and we do not agree when @xmath14 is extended to the more phenomenologically accessible ones given by [ eq1 ] ^=^- , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the relative four momenta for the constituent quark 1 and anti - quark 2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    ".,width=144 ]    although jaus s calculation and our calculation used the same denominator @xmath2 in eq.([eq1 ] ) , they led to the different conclusions in the analysis of the zero - mode contribution .",
    "even if @xmath2 is chosen in such a way to get the manifestly covariant @xmath14 , the difference in the conclusions does nt go away .    for the spin-1 elastic form factor calculations ,",
    "jaus s conclusion@xcite is that the matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 both get the zero - mode contributions so that one can not avoid the zero - mode contributions to the form factor @xmath20 for the vector meson .",
    "however , we recently  @xcite found that only the matrix element @xmath19 gets the zero - mode contribution so that we can avoid the zero - mode contribution to @xmath20 without using the matrix element @xmath19 . while this calls for a clarification whether the @xmath12-dependent formulation adds the more complication in the effect of zero - modes , our finding of zero - mode contribution only in @xmath19 is quite significant in the lfqm phenomenology .",
    "it opens up a possibility to make reliable predictions on the spin-1 elastic form factors as we presented in the example of the @xmath21 meson@xcite .",
    "similarly , for the weak transition form factors between the pseudoscalar(p ) and vector(v ) mesons , jaus@xcite concluded that the form factor @xmath22[or @xmath0 ] receives the zero - mode contribution since the zero - mode contribution to the bad(- ) current is not unexpected .",
    "here , we discuss the zero - mode contribution to the good(+ ) current matrix elements only . ] .",
    "our aim of this work is to examine the zero - mode issue of this form factor @xmath0 using our method .",
    "as we show in this work , we again do not agree with his result but find that @xmath0 is free from the zero - mode contribution if the denominator @xmath2 in eq.([eq1 ] ) contains the term proportional to the lf energy @xmath3 with the power @xmath4 .",
    "the phenomenologically accessible lfqm satisfies this condition @xmath4 .    in this work",
    ", we shall compute the weak transition form factors between pseudoscalar and vector mesons in three typical cases of the vector meson vertex , _",

    "( 3 ) , however , @xmath33 does not yield a manifestly covariant @xmath14 and thus we can not compute the nonvalence contribution involving the non - wavefunction vertex beyond the two - body fock state . the non - wavefunction vertex which satisfies the requirement that the physical observables must be lorentz",
    "invariant has not yet been realized in the case ( 3 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lessons from the manifestly covariant cases ( _ e.g. _ ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) provide a significant constraint on the non - wavefunction vertex , namely the power @xmath34 of the lf energy @xmath35 should be common both in the valence and nonvalence contributions .",
    "we do nt see any reason why this constraint can not be applied to the case ( 3 ) .",
    "the continuity of the power @xmath34 between the valence and nonvalence contributions is sufficient for us to show the absence of the zero - mode contribution using the power counting of the longitudinal momentum fraction in @xmath13 limit .",
    "the absence of zero - mode contribution assures that our valence result in @xmath36 frame is the full result in the case ( 3 ) .",

    "the zero - mode contribution to @xmath160 in @xmath31 frame is distinguished from that appears in the purely longitudial @xmath211 frame . in the purely longitudinal frame",

    "this difference between jaus s and ours is caused by the different treatment of @xmath181 term as we have illustrated in the previous section(sec.iii ) .",
    "now , in the case ( 3 ) with @xmath109 , we compared the result @xmath199(circle ) in the @xmath31 frame with the valence results obtained in the purely longitudinal @xmath133 frame with @xmath200(dotted line ) and @xmath201(dot - dashed line ) , respectively . as we discussed in the previous section using the power - counting rule ,",

    "in this work , we have analyzed the zero - mode contribution to the weak transition form factors , in particular @xmath0 , between pseudoscalar and vector mesons . for the phenomenologically accessible vector meson vertex @xmath225 , we discussed the three typical cases of the @xmath2-term which may be also classified by the differences in the power - counting of the lf energy @xmath118 , _ i.e. _ : ( 1 ) @xmath226 , ( 2 ) @xmath227/m_v\\sim ( k^-)^1 $ ] , and ( 3 ) @xmath228 . our main idea to obtain the weak transition form factors is first to find if the zero - mode contribution exists or not for the given form factor using the power - counting method . if exists , then the separation of the on - mass - shell propagating part from the off - mass - shell part is useful since the off - mass - shell part is responsible for the zero - mode contribution .",
    "we found that the form factors @xmath60 and @xmath158 are immune to the zero - mode contribution in all three cases .",
    "however , the existence / non - existence of the zero - mode in the form factor @xmath0 depends on the cases . while the zero - mode contribution exists in the case ( 1 ) with @xmath107 , the other two cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , are immune to the zero - mode contribution .",
    "this contrasts to jaus s approach  @xcite .",
    "although jaus and we both agree on the vanishing zero - mode contribution to the form factors @xmath60 and @xmath158 , the two approaches led to different conclusions on the form factor @xmath0 .",
    "while jaus concluded that @xmath0 receives the zero - mode contribution for any @xmath2-term , we showed that the validity of his prescription on @xmath181-term is limited to the case ( 1 ) with @xmath107 .",
    "this is also supported by our confirmation that the two approaches coincide if and only if @xmath224 ( not by his presciption @xmath185 ) for the cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) with @xmath229 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "all of these findings stem from the fact that the zero - mode contribution to the form factor @xmath0 is absent if the denominator @xmath2 of the vector meson vertex @xmath230 contains the term proportional to the lf energy @xmath3 with the power @xmath4 .",
