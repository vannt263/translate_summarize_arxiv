    "the most luminous galaxies in the local universe are luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs ) which emit the vast majority of their radiant power in the far - infrared .",
    "these are gas - rich systems which are in the late stages of collisions or mergers , and extrapolation from the properties of lower luminosity starburst galaxies suggests that the ligs should be active star forming systems ( see sanders & mirabel 1996 for a review ) .",
    "the ligs also show many characteristics of agn and their luminosities reach values comparable to those of luminous qsos . much effort has been focused on whether the power from the ligs is principally from starburst or agn activity , although both types of activity may be present , frequently in the same system .",
    "the discussion has been framed around a scenario proposed by @xcite in which a merger of gas - rich disk galaxies stimulates a massive nuclear starburst , which in turn feeds a coalescing agn core in the galaxy nucleus .",
    "as the agn turns on , radiation pressure drives out the shroud of dust , revealing a nascent quasar .",
    "other authors @xcite have proposed variations on the theme of compact , luminous starbursts giving rise to agn activity .",
    "the goal must be not only to understand the dominant source of energy in ligs , but to understand the relationship between starburst and agn activity , and other galaxy characteristics , and to place them into an evolutionary context .",
    "we have for some time been approaching this problem by investigating the characteristics of a complete sample of ligs defined by condon _",
    "( 1991 ; chyt ) ; this work has concentrated on vlbi observations which offer unique agn / starburst diagnostics in one of the few wavelength regimes where the optical depths to the active regions may fall below unity .    in a non - imaging 18-cm vlbi survey of luminous infrared galaxies from the chyt sample for compact ,",
    "high - brightness temperature emission commonly associated with agn activity , lonsdale , smith , and lonsdale ( 1993 ; paper i ) showed that milli - arcsecond scale emission with @xmath4 is common , perhaps universal in ligs .",
    "furthermore , the ligs follow a similar relationship between core radio power and bolometric luminosity to radio - quiet qsos @xcite",
    ". this work lends support to the interpretation of ligs as dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "on the other hand , in a detailed analysis of our vlbi survey data , smith , lonsdale and lonsdale ( 1998 ; paper ii ) investigated a starburst origin for ligs in which the compact , high-@xmath5 emission is produced by luminous radio supernovae ( rsn ) .",
    "this analysis indicates that most , but not all , lig vlbi - scale emission may be modelled with starburst - generated rsn , provided the rsn are _ extremely luminous_. the predictions of this analysis were confirmed with the detection of luminous rsn in the nuclei of arp 220 , consistent with a starburst origin for the infrared luminosity of this lig @xcite .",
    "we are continuing a monitoring program of the arp 220 lrsn allowing refinement of the characteristics of lrsn in the extreme lig environment ; preliminary results @xcite suggest that decay timescales are longer than for `` normal '' lrsn with a concomitant reduction in our estimate of the rate of luminous rsn  but not total rsn  frequency .",
    "other radio supernova candidates have since been suggested in galaxies studied here  4 near the nucleus of mrk 231 @xcite and 1 in the starburst ring around the nucleus of ngc 7469 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present 18 cm vlbi imaging of mrk 231 , ugc 5101 and ngc 7469 , ligs which had vlbi detections in our survey of a character which can not be adequately fitted by multiple , luminous radio supernovae  either isolated or in clumps .",
    "all three galaxies have also commonly been interpreted as agn based on optical spectroscopic data .",
    "these continuum imaging observations are designed to determine the nature of the central radio cores in mrk 231 , ugc 5101 , and ngc 7469 , to investigate the relationship between agn and starburst within these 3 ligs , and to investigate the relationship between these galaxies and other agn and lig systems .",

    "since we expect the agn component to be warmer in the infrared , this represents a lower limit to the starburst fraction and luminosity .",

    "such a solution is implausible given the mir core luminosities detected directly in each of the 3 ligs @xcite .",
    "one obvious way to reconcile the low @xmath144 values is to assume that some of the radio emission on larger size scales , which we have attributed to the starburst , in fact arises ultimately from the agn instead , either from unrecognized jet structure or energy pumped into the dense ism from the central agn in a more spatially distributed manner which is unrecognized in the vla maps . to follow this argument to a logical limit we derived the total radio flux that must be attributed to the agn instead of the starburst in order to raise @xmath144 to 2.34 ;",

    "it is thought that radio power is a function of black hole mass and accretion rate @xcite and we certainly might expect accretion rate to be high in these dust and gas rich objects . or are they unusually luminous in the radio because a low power agn radio source is running into unusually dense ism in the circumnuclear starburst ?

    "the mir luminosity of seyfert galaxies and quasars is potentially a good indicator of both the blue luminosity and the x - ray luminosity , for agn with modest n@xmath149 columns , and presumably also the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "the near - ir luminosity is less well correlated with the x - ray luminosity than is the mir luminosity , probably due to a combination of increased effects of extinction , but is still a useful diagnostic .",
    "the analysis of the extinction to these regions is a highly complex topic .",

    "a detailed analysis of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "here we address the specifics of the nir and mir emission and extinction for our 3 ligs , insofar as it can help to constrain the underlying agn luminosity .",
    "the pg qsos investigated by @xcite display a remarkably uniform distribution of jhk colors .",
    "this is illustrated in the tight and parallel relations between j , h and k absolute magnitudes as a function of integrated uv - fir luminosity in figure 6 , where we have restricted the pg sample to objects with z@xmath190.2 so that the nir part of the rest frame spectrum is being sampled .",
    "this behavior allows a meaningful comparison to the lig colors , even though the path and extinction law of any extinction to the lig agn cores may not be well understood .    in figure 6",
    "we have plotted the core j , h and k sources of each lig twice : once against the total near- to far - ir luminosity of the object @xcite , and once with the agn luminosity fraction listed in table 5 .",
    "there is a quantitative difference in the location of mrk 231 and the other two ligs in this figure : mrk 231 displays the same colors as the pg qsos .",
    "this indicates that it has the same sed shape as these relatively unreddened qsos , and is therefore probably itself essentially unreddened in the nir . for a galactic extinction law",
    ", the reddening measured in the optical , a@xmath1512.0 mag , corresponds to a@xmath1520.2 mag , which is unmeasurable against the dispersion of the pg colors in figure 6 .",
    "the other two ligs show larger relative separations between the bands , and moreover [ mag@xmath153mag@xmath154 at the luminosity of the lig increases from k to h to j , in the sense expected for the effect of reddening .",
    "these two ligs therefore probably display reddening in the nir to the nuclear point source , that is to the core of the agn .",
    "note , however , that an analysis of the mir core flux in section 4.3 may amend this conclusion .",
    "if the nuclear point source in mrk 231 is unreddened in the nir then it must also suffer little extinction unless the extinction is grey .",
    "we can therefore use the measured nir absolute magnitudes to fit mrk 231 horizontally to the pg qso relations , thereby estimating the true luminosity of the agn in this source , as given in table 5 : @xmath155 ( l@xmath21 ) with agn luminosity fraction 40% .",

    "we have attempted fits using a galactic extinction law @xcite .",
    "this analysis should only be considered indicative of luminosities and extinctions for several reasons .",
    "first , the instrinsic uncertainty in the extinction due to the dispersion in the qso relations is large : @xmath00.7 mag .",
    "also , we can not rule out ( a ) a different reddening law from galactic ; ( b ) scattering which could blue the colors ( _ eg .",
    "_ ngc 7469 ) ; or ( c ) emission from hot dust which could redden the @xmath35 $ ] color , as suggested by @xcite for ugc 5101 .",
    "furthermore we may have underestimated the bolometric luminosities of either the pg qsos or the ligs by excluding x - ray emission , therefore introducing uncertainty in the horizontal separation of the ligs from the qsos .    for ugc 5101 , with an assumed agn luminosity of 11.44",
    ", we find a consistent fit across the three bands with a@xmath156=8.9 @xmath1431.0 . for ngc 7469 , with an assumed agn luminosity of 11.3 , however , the apparent extinction required to correct the j , h and k bands to the pg qso sequence is a@xmath156 = 3.2 , 3.9 and 5.9 respectively , which displays inconsistency in the extinction law .",
    "the discrepancy from the galactic extinction law is in the sense of the de - reddened lig colors being too blue .",
    "if we take a smaller value for the agn luminosity the extinction correction decreases in size and shifts to better agreement with the galactic law ; an optimum value occurs at about l@xmath157=11.2 and a@xmath156=1.9 .    finally in figure 7",
    "we show the relation between integrated uv - fir luminosity @xcite and core 12@xmath10 m power . for the pg qsos",
    "we take the total iras flux as reported by @xcite , limiting the sample to z@xmath190.4 so that the 12@xmath10 m filter does not shift shortward of the 7@xmath10 m mir bump . for the ligs we plot the @xmath19100pc - scale 12@xmath10 m core source ( solid symbols ) @xcite , taking as the agn power the luminosity given in table 5 column 4 .",
    "also shown ( open symbols ) are total iras 12@xmath10 m powers vs total luminosity ( column 2 of table 5 ) .",
    "the pg qso power could be overestimated if there is substantial star formation within the large iras beam @xcite .",
    "the pg qsos show a very tight relation in this figure , with 12@xmath10 m power @xmath01% of total power ( neglecting the x - ray range ) .",
    "the effects of a factor of 2 extinction in figure 7 are shown .",
    "since the source of the mir emission is thought to be a dusty torus which can become optically thick in the mir , a detailed radiative transfer model is required to describe the source .",
    "silicate absorption features are indicative of overall extinction , however the equivalent width of such features depends not only on the intrinsic equatorial optical depth of the torus , but on the inclination to the line of sight , the torus height , and the dust temperature .",
    "inclination is the biggest overall factor in mir extinction , with edge - on disks being strongly attenuated in observed luminosity .",
    "the absorbed mir luminosity of such an inclined torus is not necessarily detected at longer ir wavlengths after absorption and re - emission from more distant , cooler dust grains , because the torus does not emit isotropically .    in figure 7",
    "we see that the uncorrected 12@xmath10 m core power of ugc 5101 is low by a factor of 22.5 compared to the pg qsos ( though the qso relation is not strongly defined in this luminosity range ) and that ugc 5101 is more under - luminous compared to the qsos than the other two ligs .",
    "this could either mean that there is considerable extinction at 12@xmath10 m or that the uv - fir agn luminosity has been over - estimated .",
    "we favor the first interpretation because in large aperture iso spectra , ugc 5101 shows the deepest water ice absorption at 6.0@xmath10 m among the seds reported by @xcite , coupled with a very strong silicate absorption and pah emission . also , the core jhk colors are significantly redder than for ngc 7469 and mrk 231 , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "thus a consistent picture arises in which the agn core of ugc 5101 is more heavily absorbed throughout the nir and mir than the other 2 ligs , and in which the 12@xmath10 m core luminosity in figure 7 ( filled circle ) is an underestimate of the agn mir luminosity .",
    "although the 12@xmath10 m agn luminosity is underestimated in figure 7 , the _ total _ luminosity of the ugc 5101 agn ( horizontal axis ) is not necessarily affected since it is an independently inferred parameter .",
    "however the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy may have been underestimated due to mir extinction , depending on where the extinction occurs , and this would affect the analysis of section 4.1 and the inferred total agn luminosity . specifically ,",
    "if the extinction occurs in front of the torus in the starburst medium , the absorbed mir flux will have been accounted for in the total far - infrared emission detected by iras ( open circle in figure 7 ) and the section 4.1 analysis is unaffected .",
    "however , if the observed mir extinction occurs within a torus inclined partly into our line - of - sight , it is possible the some of the missed flux is beamed out of our line - of - sight altogether . in that case",
    "the total galaxy luminosity is underestimated by iras ( column 2 of table 5 ) , the starburst vs agn luminosity fraction would decrease in the analysis of section 4.1 ( columns 5 and 6 ) , and the total agn luminosity of column 4 would increase .",
    "thus both data points in figure 7 would shift up and to the right .",
    "ngc 7469 is more consistent with the qso relation in figure 7 , though perhaps a little under - luminous . @xcite",
    "have modelled the nir and mir emission of ngc 7469 with the torus models of @xcite , finding that the flat sed requires a viewing angle @xmath1930@xmath71 , _ ie . _ close to face on . in that case",
    "little of the mir emission would be lost to extinction ( see figure 9 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is generally consistent with the small , but detectable , nir extinction inferred from the nuclear nir colors ( figure 6 ) .",
    "in contrast , for mrk 231 the core 12@xmath10 m power is somewhat over - luminous unless we have underestimated the bolometric agn luminosity by a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "it s unlikely that this missing luminosity is represented by the total uv - fir measurement ( open triangle ) because that would leave nothing over for the starburst , therefore this missing luminosity would need to be attributed to power missed by the iras measurements , _ eg .",
    "_ high frequency uv - x - ray flux beamed away from the line - of - sight .",
    "there is indeed evidence for a very high x - ray absorbing column to the core of mrk 231 @xcite , which is probably sufficient to hide a nuclear hard x - ray source of @xmath158 10@xmath159 erg@xmath73s@xmath29 , as implied by the mir power by figure 17 of @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mir sed of mrk 231 is probably significantly absorbed , exacerbating the apparent underestimation of the core agn power deduced from figure 7 .",
    "mrk 231 has a very similar 220@xmath10 m sed shape to ngc 7469 @xcite , except for the significant silicate absorption feature .",
    "to reproduce such a feature there could be foreground extinction by the starburst medium , or the torus could be significantly more inclined to the line - of - sight , or of higher equatorial optical depth , in which case the mir luminosity of the torus that we observe may underestimate the face - on luminosity by a factor of 2 or significantly more .",
    "such a result would seem at face value to be inconsistent with the conclusion from figure 6 that the nir core source is relatively unreddened .",
    "however such a flat 1@xmath1607@xmath10 m sed @xcite can instead be explained as additional warm dust emission from the agn cone , as modelled for ngc 1068 @xcite .    in summary",
    ", there is evidence from the nir and mir observations that the agn power of mrk 231 may be underestimated in table 5 ( column 4 ) by a ( highly uncertain ) factor of about 5 .",
    "similarly the agn power for ugc 5101 may be underestimated by a factor of two and overestimated by a similar factor for ngc 7469 though a factor of two is well within the uncertainty of this analysis .",
    "this agn power may be unaccounted for in the total galaxy luminosities listed in column 2 also ; this is almost certainly the case for mrk 231 .",
    "this unaccounted agn power in mrk 231 may be enough to bring it into line with the most luminous radio quiet qsos in figure 5 ( open symbols ) , but ugc 5101 and ngc 7469 remain radio - loud in that plot .",
    "detailed hard x - ray spectroscopy and modelling will be required to resolve this question .      among oh megamaser sources which have been studied at milliarcsecond resolutions , mrk 231",
    "is currently unique in the lack of compact structures .",
    "well - studied sources such as arp 220 @xcite and iiizw35 @xcite have compact maser structures which account for many tens of percent of the total oh luminosity .",
    "darling and giovanelli ( 2002a ) report temporal variability in one distant oh megamaser , and cite further evidence for widespread saturated ( and thus compact ) maser emission in @xmath161 megamaser galaxies @xcite .",
    "clues to this unique lack of compact oh megamaser emission in mrk 231 may come from understanding other ways in which mrk 231 is unusual .",
    "the most obvious one is that the agn core is relatively unobscured in the optical - nir , suggesting that it lies further along the presumed starburst - agn evolutionary track .",
    "we speculate that as the agn injected copious quantities of both mechanical and radiative energy into the original dense circumnuclear shroud , as evidenced by the bal wind and the radio jets , much of the cool molecular environment most conducive to the formation of compact masers was destroyed .",
    "this destruction is likely to have been complete in the agn outflow cones .",
    "mrk 231 may be a rare transition object in which the compact masers have been destroyed , but some diffuse maser clouds in the outer disk have so far survived .",
    "however a strong circumnuclear starburst remains , which is extemely luminous in its own right and which might be expected to contain compact masers like those found in the arp 220 starburst region .",
    "this region , roughly perpendicular to the agn outflow axis , and of @xmath0 400 pc dimension , has not been cleared out by the agn ; indeed a dense optically thick molecular torus is thought to still exist , along with a high column , low ionization bal wind at smaller radii .",
    "thus the lack of detectable oh emission coincident with the northern continuum lobe is particularly surprising , since the starburst disk geometry proposed by other workers suggests that part of the disk should lie in front of that lobe , which exhibits strong free - free absorption .",
    "one factor which might influence the existence of compact maser clouds is the overall density in the mrk 231 starburst . unlike arp 220",
    ", it extends about @xmath0400pc in diameter , and thus has a star - formation surface density of @xmath162m@xmath163yr@xmath29pc@xmath164 , a factor of approximately 16 less than arp 220 .",
    "these lower density conditions in the later stages of a starburst may inhibit the formation or pumping of compact maser clouds .",
    "additionally , the lack of amplified continuum vlbi structures may be explained by the liklihood that the cooler , outer regions of the disk will harbor most of the oh maser clouds .",
    "these outer regions may lie , in projection , to the north of all the continuum vlbi - scale structure .",
