    "these aspects are investigated in the next two subsections .",
    "the two following general results hold ( see appendices  [ sec : operator_as_pol_spin_col ] and  [ sec : reduced_density_matrix_spin_coll ] )  : any symmetric operator of an @xmath1-qubit system can be written as a polynomial of degree at most @xmath1 in the collective spin observables and the matrix elements of the @xmath17-qubit reduced density matrix @xmath50 of any symmetric state @xmath16 can be written as a polynomial of order @xmath17 in the expectation values of collective spin observables in the state @xmath16 .",

    "they are the only states to verify @xmath55 , or , equivalently , @xmath56 the expectation value of the collective spin vanishes for mes states and only for them .",
    "this also implies that these states coincide with spin-@xmath57 order-1 anticoherent states .",
    "a spin-@xmath57 state is said to be anticoherent to order @xmath17 if @xmath58 is independent of @xmath59 for @xmath60 , where @xmath59 is a unit vector  [ @xcite .",

    "actually , this generalizes to any order  : order-@xmath17 anticoherence is equivalent to maximal mixedness of @xmath62 in the symmetric subspace  @xcite , and consequently to @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the @xmath65-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "for instance , the two - qubit reduced density operator @xmath66 can be expressed in the two - qubit dicke state basis @xmath67 as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 .",

    "any pure symmetric state of @xmath1 qubits can be anticoherent at most to order @xmath80 .",

    "this interpretation can be pursued to higher orders of anticoherence .",
    "an anticoherent state to order 2 will be characterized by vanishing dipole and quadrupole moments of its husimi function .",

    "some of these points can be superimposed on each other ( in the case of equality of the corresponding individual states ) , yielding a single distinct point on the bloch sphere with a multiplicity larger than 1 .",
