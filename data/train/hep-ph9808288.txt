    "many theories , like composite models  @xcite , technicolor  @xcite , and grand unified theories  @xcite , predict the existence of new particles , called leptoquarks , that mediate quark - lepton transitions . in this work",
    "we focus our attention to scalar leptoquarks ( @xmath1 ) that couple to pairs @xmath2@xmath3 or @xmath4@xmath3 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 . at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , leptoquarks can be pair produced by gluon ",
    "gluon and quark  quark fusions , as well as singly produced in association with a lepton in gluon ",
    "quark reactions .",
    "therefore , the production of third generation leptoquarks can lead to multilepton signals accompanied by jets and missing @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) since the heavy quark decay can give rise to further leptons and jets .",
    "this means that third generation leptoquarks can , in principle , mimic the multilepton supersymmetry ( susy ) signals  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we investigated the importance of the multilepton signatures for such leptoquarks at the lhc .    in our analyses we considered the following multilepton topologies :    @xmath9 one lepton topology ( 1l ) which exhibits one lepton ( @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) in association with jets and @xmath8 ;    @xmath9 opposite - sign dilepton events ( os ) which contain a pair of leptons of opposite charge in addition to jets and @xmath8 ;    @xmath9 same - sign dilepton topology ( ss ) which presents a pair of leptons with the same charge , jets and @xmath8 ;    @xmath9 trilepton events ( 3l ) which possess 3 charged leptons , jets , and @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , we employed the cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite which studied the multilepton signals for supersymmetry in the framework of the minimal supergravity model ( msugra ) .",
    "the use of these cuts not only reduces the standard model ( sm ) backgrounds , but also allow us to compare the leptoquark signals with the msugra ones .    in principle",
    ", leptoquark events possess the striking signature of a peak in the invariant mass of a charged lepton and a jet , which could be used to further reduce backgrounds and to establish that an observed signal is due to leptoquarks .",
    "this is an important feature of the signals for first generation leptoquarks  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , third generation leptoquarks exhibit cascade decays containing heavy quarks and/or @xmath12 , which give rise to neutrinos , and consequently wash out the lepton - jet invariant mass peak .",
    "since leptoquarks are an undeniable signal of physics beyond the sm , there have been several direct searches for them in accelerators . at the tevatron collider",
    "it was established that leptoquarks coupling to @xmath4@xmath7 pairs should be heavier than 99  gev  @xcite . moreover , low - energy experiments lead to indirect bounds on the couplings and masses of third generation leptoquarks .",
    "leptoquarks may give rise to flavor changing neutral current processes if they couple to more than one family of quarks or leptons  @xcite . in order to avoid these bounds",
    ", we assumed that the leptoquarks couple only to one quark family and one lepton generation .",
    "the effects of third generation leptoquarks on the @xmath13 physics through radiative corrections lead to limits on leptoquarks that couple to top quarks  @xcite . as a rule of a thumb ,",
    "the @xmath13-pole data constrain the masses of leptoquarks to be larger than @xmath14@xmath15 gev when their yukawa coupling is equal to the electromagnetic coupling @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "a natural hypothesis for theories beyond the sm is that they exhibit the gauge symmetry @xmath17 above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath18 , therefore , we imposed this symmetry on the leptoquark interactions .",
    "in order to evade strong bounds coming from the proton lifetime experiments , we required baryon ( @xmath19 ) and lepton ( @xmath20 ) number conservation .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian for leptoquarks satisfying the above requirements and electric charge and color conservation is given by  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( @xmath3 ) stands for the left - handed quark ( lepton ) doublet , and we omitted the flavor indices of the leptoquark couplings to fermions .",
    "the leptoquarks @xmath24 and @xmath25 are singlets under @xmath26 , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are doublets , and @xmath29 is a triplet .",
    "the multilepton samples due to leptoquarks were obtained using the monte carlo event generator pythia  @xcite .",
    "we assumed in our analyses that the leptoquarks decay exclusively into a single quark - lepton pair .",
    "the general case can be easily obtained by multiplying the signal cross section by an appropriate branching ratio , which can be read from the lagrangian  ( [ e : int ] ) .",
    "the cross sections for leptoquark ( @xmath30 ) pair production via @xmath31 or @xmath32 are model independent because the leptoquark ",
    "gluon interaction is entirely determined by the @xmath33 gauge invariance . on the other hand , the single production through @xmath34 is model dependent once it involves the unknown yukawa coupling of leptoquarks to a lepton ",
    "quark pair . however , this last process is important only for third generation leptoquarks coupling to @xmath4 quarks since the top quark content of the proton is negligible at the lhc energy .    in this work",
    "we focused our attention on leptoquarks decaying into @xmath4@xmath3 or @xmath2@xmath3 pairs , with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "we generated samples containing 10000 events for each leptoquark type and production mechanism , assuming two values for the masses : 300 and 500 gev .",
    "since the @xmath4 content of the proton is rather small , we assumed that the leptoquark yukawa coupling to be 10 times de electron electric charge for the single production of @xmath4@xmath7 , @xmath4@xmath6 , or @xmath4@xmath16 leptoquarks .    in our analyses , we applied the following cuts used in ref .",
    "@xcite :    * clusters with @xmath35  gev and @xmath36 are labeled as jets ; however , for jet - veto only , clusters with @xmath37  gev and @xmath36 are regarded as jets ; * muons and electrons are classified as isolated if they have @xmath38  gev , @xmath39 and the visible activity within a cone of @xmath40 about the lepton direction is less then @xmath41  gev ; * jet multiplicity , @xmath42 , with @xmath43  gev ; * transverse sphericity @xmath44 , * @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath8 @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a parameter that one can vary , see the figures below ;",
    "* we required the leptons to have @xmath49  gev and @xmath50@xmath8)@xmath51  gev for the one lepton signal and @xmath52  gev for @xmath53 lepton signals .    in our analyses , we simulated a simple calorimeter using the subroutine lucell , which is part of jetset / pythia package , adopting the same parameters employed in ref .",
    "we should also point out that the effect of cracks , edges and other detector inefficiencies have not been taken into account here .",
    "in the following figures we present our results for the leptoquark cross sections after the above cuts as a function of the parameter @xmath48 . for the sake of comparison , we also exhibit in our figures the sm backgrounds ( bg ) and msugra cross sections for two sets of parameters chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite , which correspond to the extreme cases analyzed in this work . in case 1",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath54 gev , @xmath55 gev , and @xmath56 gev , while , in case 6 , @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev , and @xmath59 gev .",
    "both scenarios employ @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 gev .",
    "the production cross section for @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath4@xmath16 leptoquarks are the same .",
    "moreover , this is also true for the production of @xmath2@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath6 leptoquarks .",
    "therefore we present our results only for @xmath4@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath16 leptoquarks which are equal to the ones for @xmath4@xmath6 and @xmath2@xmath6 leptoquarks respectively .",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "1ljets](a ) the leptoquark production cross sections into the 1l topology as a function of @xmath48 for scalar leptoquarks decaying into @xmath4@xmath16 and @xmath4@xmath7 with a mass of 300 gev .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath4@xmath16 signal is immersed in the sm backgrounds since the @xmath0 cuts affects strongly the signal . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath4@xmath7 signal is well above the background for all values of the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquarks lead to cross sections with values between the two msugra cases for @xmath63 gev . in fig .  [ 1ljets](b ) we present the results for the 1l topology in the case of @xmath2@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath7 leptoquarks with masses of 500 gev . in this case",
    ", the signals are always above the background and are also between the two msugra cases .    in fig .",
    "[ osjets](a ) we present our results for scalar @xmath4@xmath16 and @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquarks with a mass of 300  gev into the os topology .",
    "we observe again that the signal for @xmath4@xmath16 leptoquarks is practically always immersed in the sm backgrounds due to the same reason pointed out in the previous case .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquark signal is above the background for @xmath64 gev .",
    "this type of leptoquark leads to a cross section with values between the two msugra cases independently of the @xmath48 cut applied . in fig .",
    "[ osjets](b ) the results for the same topology but for @xmath2@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath7 leptoquarks with a mass of 500 gev are displayed .",
    "for @xmath65 gev these two signals are above the expected bg and their cross section values are between the two msugra extreme cases even if one imposes a large @xmath48 cut .    the production cross sections for third generation leptoquarks into the ss topology as a function of @xmath48 are shown in figs .",
    "[ ssjets ] . in fig .",
    "[ ssjets](a ) one sees that the signal of @xmath4@xmath16 leptoquarks is above the background for @xmath66 gev while @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquark signal is above the background for @xmath14 gev @xmath67 gev .",
    "the @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquark can probably only be distinguished from the msugra case 6 if one demands @xmath68 gev . in fig .",
    "[ ssjets](b ) @xmath2@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath7 leptoquarks with a mass of 500 gev are shown to be well above the background and to lay between the msugra cases .    finally in figs .",
    "[ 3ljets ] the behavior of the cross sections for the 3l topology as a function of @xmath48 is presented for the scalar leptoquarks as well as for the msugra cases and sm backgrounds .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath4@xmath16 leptoquarks of 300 gev shown in fig .  [ 3ljets](a ) are above the background only for @xmath66 gev .",
    "the the production cross section of @xmath4@xmath7 leptoquarks is always above the background and it presents a flat plateau in the region where @xmath69 gev @xmath70 gev . in fig .",
    "[ 3ljets](b ) we see again that @xmath2@xmath16 and @xmath2@xmath7 leptoquarks of 500 gev are above the background and right in between the msugra extreme cases .",
    "in our analyses we observed that third generation leptoquark cross sections are generally above the sm background in all multilepton topologies we have investigated .",
    "moreover , the leptoquarks signals are of the same magnitude of msugra cross sections , making it rather difficult to distinguish susy events from leptoquark ones .",
    "it is clear that one has to investigate more carefully the possibility of mistaken third generation leptoquarks for susy in the multilepton channels .",
    "observation of the signal in several multilepton channels is crucial to try to identify the source of new physics but this may turn out to be a great challenger .",
    "in this work , we analyzed the multilepton signals for third generation leptoquarks .",
    "we showed that the analyses designed to discover gluinos and squarks via multilepton events are also rather good to select third generation leptoquarks .",
    "we concluded that for third generation leptoquarks with masses of several hundred gev , the leptoquark signal is not only above the standard model backgrounds , but also of the same order of the expected msugra cross sections .",
    "therefore , the observation of an excess of multilepton events accompanied by jets and missing @xmath0 can be due to leptoquarks or supersymmetric particles . since the leptoquark mass reconstruction is usually not efficient , due to the presence of neutrinos in many decays ,",
    "there is no clear footprint of leptoquarks in this class of events .",
    "therefore , the origin of the multilepton events can only the establish looking at other topologies , for instance , multilepton events without the presence of jets , which are characteristic of @xmath71@xmath72 production in some regions of the msugra parameter space  @xcite .",
    "it seems that unless nature is extremely kind to us exhibiting signals of new physics in many different channels , an observed signal in any of the four discussed channels at the lhc can not be uniquely interpreted as due to the production of susy particles .",
    "even if observation is accomplished in all four channels analyzed in this work , it may still not be possible to distinguish between leptoquarks and supersymmetric particles .",
