    "the pion s elastic electromagnetic form factor is accessible via a properly constructed six - point quark schwinger function , a fact exploited with modest success in lattice - qcd simulations , e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "this schwinger function is also the basis for continuum studies , among which those employing the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite are efficacious @xcite .",
    "the proton s form factors are accessible through an analogous eight - point quark schwinger function , which is the starting point for lattice simulations , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . the fruitful extension of dse methods to the calculation of this schwinger function is a contemporary goal .",
    "as we will explain , a simple truncation that corresponds to a spectator approximation is currently in widespread use @xcite .",
    "manifest covariance is a strength of this approach for it has long been apparent that in order to obtain an internally consistent understanding of proton form factor data at spacelike momentum transfers @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the proton s mass , a poincar covariant description of the scattering process is necessary @xcite .",
    "this has recently been reemphasised in the context of constituent - quark models @xcite .",
    "the same interaction which describes the structure and properties of colour - singlet mesons also generates a quark - quark ( diquark ) correlation in the colour antitriplet ( @xmath3 ) channel @xcite .",
    "such correlations have recently been observed in simulations of lattice - qcd @xcite . while diquarks do not survive as asymptotic states @xcite ; viz .",
    ", they do not appear in the strong interaction spectrum , the existence of strong quark - quark correlations provides a foundation for viewing the nucleon as a quark - diquark composite .",
    "this picture can be realised via a poincar covariant faddeev equation @xcite , in which two quarks are always correlated as a @xmath4-diquark , and binding in the nucleon is effected by the iterated exchange of roles between the dormant and diquark - participant quarks , and through the action of a pion `` cloud '' @xcite .    upon solving the faddeev equation one obtains the nucleon s mass , and also its faddeev amplitude which is a valuable intuitive tool .",
    "it is noteworthy that even a rudimentary covariant faddeev equation model , based on the presence of diquark correlations within the nucleon , yields a matrix - valued amplitude that , in the nucleon s rest frame , corresponds to a relativistic wave function with a material lower component ; i.e. , a wave function with `` @xmath5-wave , '' and , indeed , `` @xmath6-wave '' correlations , too @xcite .",
    "nonzero quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon is a straightforward outcome of a poincar covariant description .",
    "while some issues remain unresolved @xcite , contemporary data @xcite suggest that a single dipole mass can not simultaneously characterise the @xmath7-dependence of both the proton s electric and magnetic form factors .",
    "this possibility was evident in the faddeev - amplitude - based calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , as emphasised in ref .",
    "moreover , it can be inferred from ref .",
    "@xcite that this experimental result is an essential consequence of a nonperturbative and poincar covariant representation of the proton as a bound state .",
    "this may be exemplified through the role played by pseudovector components of the pion s bethe - salpeter amplitude , which are connected with the presence of quark orbital angular momentum in the pion .",
    "these pseudovector amplitudes are necessarily nonzero @xcite and responsible for the large-@xmath7 behaviour of the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite .",

    "it may nevertheless be worth noting that quark dressing disappears with increasing spacelike @xmath0 in qcd .",
    "hence , in the ultraviolet , the dressed - quark s dirac form factor must approach one ( with only @xmath89 corrections ) and its pauli form factor must vanish ; viz . , the interaction becomes pointlike in this limit . with the parameter values in eq .",

    "one may ask whether it _ can _ supply an accurate description of the nucleon s electromagnetic form factors . _ a priori _ , the answer is unknown but it is supplied by straightforward calculations .    a more important question , however , is whether the model _ should _ be accurate . in this case",
    "the answer is _",
    "no_. reference @xcite emphasises that no picture of the nucleon is veracious if it neglects axial - vector diquark correlations and the nucleon s pion `` cloud . ''",

''",
    "while the leading nonanalytic contribution to @xmath131 can alone repair the discrepancy @xcite , that does not alter the quiddity of our scheme because the scale of the effect is clear and redistributing strength between complementary contributions can be achieved merely by fine - tuning the model s parameters .     left panel ",

    "however , the remaining values point to the deficiencies of a model that retains only a scalar diquark correlation .",
    "they confirm that in this case one is unable to obtain a quantitatively accurate picture of the nucleon .",
    "this is reassuring because , in contributing to nucleon observables , axial - vector diquark correlations primarily interfere constructively with the pion cloud ; e.g. , they both provide additional binding and hence act to reduce the nucleon s mass @xcite , and they both act to increase @xmath134 , @xmath135 @xcite . hence a model that ignores these contributions but succeeds in fitting experimental data is likely to possess spurious degrees of freedom .. in this case it misses important cancellations and hence we report anomalously large values for @xmath136 .",
    "a realistic description requires a more complex current which includes fully - fledged seagull terms @xcite .",

    "[ calcpgegm ] .",

    "however , what might be considered success in that endeavour could easily be achieved through results for @xmath155 and @xmath156 individually which both disagree with the data .",
    "we calculated the proton s elastic electromagnetic form factors using a rudimentary _ ansatz _ for the nucleon s poincar covariant faddeev amplitude that represents the proton as a composite of a confined quark and confined nonpointlike scalar diquark .",
    "all such models give a faddeev wave function that corresponds to a nucleon spinor with a sizeable lower component in the rest frame .",
    "this study indicates that on the domain of @xmath0 accessible in modern precision experiments these form factors are a sensitive probe of nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "the calculated pointwise forms express a dependence on the length - scales that characterise nonperturbative phenomena , such as bound state extent , dressing of quark and gluon propagators , and meson cloud effects .",
    "this is precisely analogous to the current status of the pion s electromagnetic form factor , for which the behaviour predicted in a straightforward application of perturbative qcd is not unambiguously evident until @xmath157gev@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath154 is particularly sensitive to infrared dynamics because , as @xmath0 increases , @xmath158 is a difference of small quantities .",
    "however , this ratio should not be considered in isolation because it is possible to reproduce the experimental data using a model that simultaneously provides a poor description of the individual form factors .",
    "that is also true of the ratio @xmath159 but this combination is less responsive to model particulars because the dirac and pauli form factors are positive and fall uniformly to zero , with a momentum dependence at asymptotically large momenta given by perturbative qcd @xcite . in the absence of a veracious theoretical understanding of the nucleon , we view the latter ratio as a more sensible constraint on contemporary studies .",
    "it is apparent that much can be learnt about long - range dynamics in qcd from existing and forthcoming accurate data on nucleon form factors . in constraining systematic qcd - based calculations , one can hope , for example , to see an evolution from the domain on which meson cloud effects are important to that whereupon observables are dominated by the confined quark core .",
    "this could be elucidated by improving the present study ; viz . , basing it on a solution of the poincar covariant faddeev equation with axial - vector diquark correlations , instead of using an _ ansatz _ for the faddeev amplitude , and explicitly including meson cloud contributions .",
