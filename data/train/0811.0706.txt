    "in this paper , we will consider the benjamin - bona - mahony ( bbm ) @xcite like equation ( @xmath1 ) with a fully nonlinear dispersive term of the form @xmath2 this equation is similar to the nonlinear dispersive equation @xmath3 , @xmath4 which has been studied in detail by p. rosenau and j.m .",
    "hyman @xcite . in the literature",
    "there are many studies dealing with the travelling wave solutions of the @xmath3 and @xmath1 equations , but in general they are restricted to the case @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath0 , the solutions of @xmath3 were investigated in @xcite .",
    "our aim here is just to search for solutions of the equations @xmath1 , with @xmath0 , by means of the factorization method .",
    "we remark that this method @xcite , when it is applicable , allows to get directly and systematically a wide set of solutions , compared with other methods used in the bbm equations .",
    "for example , the direct integral method used by c. liu @xcite can only be applied to the @xmath6 equation .",
    "however , the factorization technique can be used to more equations than the direct integral method and also , in some cases , it gives rise to more general solutions than the sine - cosine and the tanh methods @xcite .",
    "this factorization approach to find travelling wave solutions of nonlinear equations has been extended to third order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) by d - s .",
    "wang and h. li @xcite .    when we look for the travelling wave solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) , first we reduce the form of the @xmath1 equation to a second order nonlinear ode and then , we can immediately apply factorization technique . here , we will assume @xmath7 , since the case @xmath8 has already been examined in a previous article following this method @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce factorization technique for a special type of the second order nonlinear ode s .",
    "then , we apply straightforwardly the factorization to the related second order nonlinear ode to get travelling wave solutions of @xmath1 equation in section 3 .",
    "we obtain the solutions for these nonlinear ode s and the @xmath1 equation in terms of weierstrass functions in section 4 . finally , in section 5 we will add some remarks .",
    "let us consider , the following nonlinear second order ode @xmath9 where @xmath10 is constant and @xmath11 is an arbitrary function of @xmath12 .",

    "when eq . ( [ 1.3 ] ) has the travelling wave solutions in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are real constants , substituting ( [ 15 ] ) into ( [ 1.3 ] ) and after integrating , we get the reduced form of eq .

    "( [ 16 ] ) are @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an integration constant .",

    "the rest of equations ( [ e23])-([e3nn ] ) can be dealt with a similar way , but they will not be worked out here for the sake of shortness .    first , we will give some properties of the @xmath80 function which will be useful in the following @xcite .",
