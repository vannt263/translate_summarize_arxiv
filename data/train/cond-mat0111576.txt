    "the phenomenon of fomp ( first order magnetization process ) was discovered during last years in many intermetallic compounds . here",
    "belong a number of practically important compounds of transition metals with rare - earths ( re ) like r@xmath4fe@xmath5b @xcite ,",
    "nd@xmath4co@xmath5b @xcite , r@xmath0fe@xmath1 @xcite , rfe@xmath2ti @xcite , rmn@xmath3sn@xmath3 @xcite , sm@xmath6nd@xmath7co@xmath8 @xcite , and also some ferrites @xcite . in some directions , magnetization jumps with increasing external magnetic field are observed in these systems .",
    "usually this effect is treated phenomenologically as a result of competition of magnetic anisotropy ( ma ) constants @xmath9 of different order @xcite .",
    "presence of large high - order constants enables one to obtain local minima of free energy and thereby first - order transitions .",
    "however , such an approach meets with a number of difficulties .",
    "large values of @xmath10 required are not confirmed by crystal - field calculations ( see refs.@xcite ) . besides that , high order @xmath9 are proportional to high powers of magnetization and should rapidly decrease with increasing temperature @xmath11 .",
    "this effect should be stronger in the case where @xmath9 come mainly from re sublattice : the rare - earth moments can become rather small at @xmath11 well below the curie temperature @xmath12 the reason is that the exchange interaction @xmath13 which acts on re ions from the transition metal ( tm ) system , may be considerably smaller than the interaction @xmath14 which determines @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , the local minima explaining fomp should exist only at low temperatures .",
    "however , fomp is observed as a rule in a wide temperature region @xcite .",
    "the dependences @xmath16 fitted from magnetization curves turn out to be rather complicated and sometimes seem to be artificial .",
    "the data discussed lead to the conclusion that effects of many - sublattice structure are important in systems demonstrating fomp @xcite .",
    "it is known that in a number of intermetallic re systems ( tm@xmath4fe@xmath17 rfe@xmath18ti , tbmn@xmath3sn@xmath3 ) temperature - induced orientational transitions are caused by competing anisotropy of re and tm sublattices ( in hexaferrites bazn@xmath19co@xmath7fe@xmath20o@xmath21 @xcite , competition of fe and co sublattices plays a similar role ) .",
    "it is natural to suppose that this factor is essential for the field - induced transitions too .",
    "although the many - sublattice case was considered earlier @xcite , these treatments were also based on the idea of competion of high - order constants .    in the present work we propose a new mechanism of fomp in a multisublattice magnet , which is connected with the formation of a non - collinear spin structure .",
    "the corresponding theoretical model is formulated in sect.2 . in sect.3",
    "we consider the fomp picture in various cases and discuss experimental situations .",
    "we start from the heisenberg model of uniaxial multisublattice crystal with inclusion of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the ma constants in the problem are usually treated as phenomenological parameters which are obtained by fitting magnetization curves . when describing fomp one introduces as a rule large high - order constants , @xmath22 . to avoid the difficulties discussed above , we include only leading - order ma constants for different magnetic sublattices , @xmath23 . using the mean - field approximation we write down the expression for the total energy @xmath24 here @xmath25 are sublattice indices , @xmath26 are the corresponding magnetic moments which make the angles @xmath27 with the @xmath28 axis , @xmath29 are exchange parameters",
    ", @xmath30 is the external magnetic field . for the sake of convenience",
    ", we have included the dimensionless factors of @xmath31 into @xmath32 so that @xmath33 the crystal and magnetic structures contain tm and re sublattices which are coupled by the exchange interaction @xmath34 .",
    "the tm subsystem yields usually main contribution to magnetic moment , and the re one to ma .",
    "the most strong interaction @xmath14 plays the role of a mean field in the tm subsystem and needs not to be included explicitly .",
    "as demonstrate crystal - field considerations , formation of non - collinear magnetic structures is possible in multisublattice structures , e.g. , for the systems r@xmath4fe@xmath5b @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of a two - sublattice magnet was analyzed earlier in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that , in the case where @xmath35 and @xmath36have opposite signs ( competing anisotropy ) , the sublattice moments become non - parallel provided that    @xmath37    if the absolute values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are close , this condition can hold even for rather strong exchange @xmath40    the two - sublattice problem with non - collinear magnetic structure enables one to obtain a local energy minimum with including magnetic field , but for one field direction only . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we have to introduce , instead of one re subsystem , _ two _ equivalent re sublattices , ri and rii , with @xmath41 , @xmath42 this model preserves the correct axial symmetry and yields the energy minimum for both field directions",
    ". of course , for real compounds with complicated crystal structures each ` sublattice ' corresponds to several crystal positions . to stabilize the non - collinear structure with split re sublattice",
    "we include the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the sublattices , @xmath43",
    ". the @xmath34 and @xmath44 values can not be reliably obtained from existing experimental data , but for the long - range rkky exchange interaction @xmath45 may be assumed not small .",
    "the essential property of such a model is the presence of metastable states already at @xmath46 .",
    "owing to this fact , first - order phase transitions are possible which occur at crossing the energy levels in the external magnetic field .",
    "the idea of the fomp mechanism can be illustrated on a simple toy model where the tm moment is rigidly fixed by strong ma in the @xmath47 direction ( or in the @xmath48 plane for the three - dimensional problem ) .",
    "the re ions which possess more weak easy - axis ma tend to incline to the @xmath28 direction , each ion having two local minima .",
    "the interaction @xmath49 results in that the degeneracy of the minima is lifted , so that the moments of re sublattices deviate in opposite directions ( fig.1a ) .",
    "with increasing magnetic field along the @xmath28 axis , a first - order transition occurs to the configuration where re moments are almost parallel ( fig.1b ) .",
    "a smooth transition does not occur because of the influence of ma of re ions .",
    "now we pass to a more realistic situation of finite ( and even small ) ma of tm subsystem .",
    "first we consider the situation where @xmath50 and the easy - axis ma of re sublattice predominates .",
    "this is the case for the systems tm@xmath4fe@xmath1 and tbmn@xmath3sn@xmath51 as follows from the existence of easy - axis - easy - plane spin - reorientation transitions with increasing temperature ( @xmath52 decreases more rapidly than @xmath53 ) .",
    "two possible metastable states are shown in fig.2 , the exchange @xmath34 being supposed antiferromagnetic , which corresponds to heavy rare - earth ions , e.g. , to tb and tm . in the case where @xmath54 which occurs for light rare - earths , e.g. , for nd and pr , the picture differs by the opposite direction of re moments .",
    "in the zero magnetic field the first state ( fig.2a ) is realized with the collinear spin configuration along the @xmath28 axis ( easy direction for the re sublattice ) . at increasing the field",
    "@xmath55 , the magnetization vector starts to rotate with retaining the nearly antiparallel orientation of tm and re moments . for simplicity , we neglect in the analytical treatment the non - collinearity of tm and re moments for this state , which is weak due to large value of @xmath56 .",
    "then the energy in the state ( a ) is expressed in terms of the angle @xmath57 beween the tm moment and @xmath28 axis ,    @xmath58    the sign @xmath59 corresponding to @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the second state ( fig.2b ) posseses a non - collinear spin configuration with split re sublattice owing to the gain in the ma energy for the re subsystem , and also due to the interaction @xmath49 . in this state",
    "the spin configuration depends weakly on magnetic field and the tm moment remains parallel to @xmath47 axis , so that @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the angle of the re moment deviation from the @xmath47 axis .",
    "the total energy in the state ( b ) has an almost linear field dependence and decreases more rapidly than that for the state ( a ) with rotating moment ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the angles @xmath57 and @xmath63 are obtained by minimization of eqs.([e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) , @xmath65 thus the local minimum ( non - collinear state ) occurs at @xmath66 note that the minimum can occur with including magnetic field , even if it is a absent at @xmath67 the transition field and the angle @xmath63 ( but not the magnetization jump ) turn out to be small provided that @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath49 and @xmath39 are proportional to @xmath69 ( unlike the constants @xmath10 in standard fomp considerations , which decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath11 ) , the criterion ( [ crr ] ) depends rather weakly on @xmath70 therefore the mechanism discussed enables one to obtain fomp in a wide temperature region .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed by direct minimization of total energy ( 1 ) without approximations discussed above .",
    "the moment values were taken to be @xmath71 , which corresponds roughly to r@xmath4fe@xmath1 compounds ( e.g. , for tb@xmath4fe@xmath72 the moment of fe subsystem exceeds by two times that of re subsystem , @xmath73 per formula unit @xcite ) . at some critical field @xmath74 becomes equal to @xmath75 ( fig.3 ) , and the magnetization demonstrates a vertical jump ( fig.4 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the transition field is much smaller than the exchange interaction @xmath76 unlike the situation of fig.1 . after the jump , the magnetization increases rather slowly because of large value of @xmath77 on the other hand , the magnetization depends very weakly on the field @xmath78 because of the strong interaction @xmath40 owing to the deviation from the antiparallel alignment , the magnetization in the hard direction @xmath47 after the transition turns out to be larger than the zero - field magnetization in the easy direction @xmath28 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "such a behavior is demonstrated by experimental dependences @xmath80 in a number of systems , e.g. , in tm@xmath4fe@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the zero - field canting angle @xmath63 of the re sublattice for the parameters of fig.3 makes up about 20@xmath81 such small values do not contradict likely experimental data .",
    "indications of formation of the non - collinear structure after the transition are given by neutron scattering data on tm@xmath4fe@xmath1 @xcite and tbmn@xmath3sn@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "non - collinear structures with the split re sublattice were also observed for r@xmath4fe@xmath5b systems @xcite .    in the system",
    "tb@xmath4fe@xmath1 @xcite the fe sublattice has the easy - plane magnetic anisotropy , as well as the tb sublattice ( although tb ions in different positions are supposed to have ma of different signs ) .",
    "thus , the competing anisotropy situation does not occur .",
    "nevertheless , in this case our approach also enables one to obtain fomp , but the transition field turns out to be somewhat larger .",
    "fig.5 shows the result of calculation of magnetization for the constants of the same sign , @xmath82 ( the easy - plane and easy - axis problems are equivalent provided that we restirict ourselves to the plane model ) .",
    "one can see that before the jump the field dependence of the magnetization is practically linear , unlike fig.4 .",
    "the state with split re sublattices occurs only with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the curves obtained demonstrate a similarity to experimental ones .",
    "let us try to perform a more detailed comparison with experimental data .",
    "the critical fomp field is determined by the overall scale of the anisotropy parameters .",
    "unfortunately , ma constants are usually fitted from magnetization curves with including high - order constants which contradicts our model .",
    "therefore we shall concentrate on the cases where the parameters of the model can be determined from independent experiments . using the data for tm@xmath4fe@xmath1 from ref.@xcite , @xmath83 per formula unit , @xmath84j/@xmath85",
    "@xmath86 j/@xmath87 j/@xmath85 we can fit the experimental fomp field , @xmath88 t , by taking @xmath89 . unfortunately , the value of the magnetization jump can not be reliably determined from the results of @xcite .",
    "the values of ma constants for tb@xmath4fe@xmath1 can be estimated from nmr data @xcite ( see ref.@xcite ) , @xmath90 j/@xmath85 @xmath91 j/@xmath92 for the positions 2b and 2d , @xmath93 j/@xmath94 of course , the accuracy of these values is rather poor . after averaging the values of @xmath95 over sublattices",
    "such a relation between ma constants corresponds roughly to the parameters of fig.5 .",
    "the rescaled fomp critical field from this figure turns out to be by about two times larger than the experimental value which makes up @xmath96 t .",
    "the agreement can be made better provided that we take somewhat smaller values of @xmath97 and increase the ratio @xmath98 besides that , the situation in tb@xmath4fe@xmath1 is complicated because of existence of two fomp - type transitions @xcite .",
    "now we treat the case where easy - axis anisotropy @xmath38 dominates over ma of re sublattice , which has an opposite sign ( such a stituation takes place , e.g. , for the compound hofe@xmath2ti ) .",
    "then the qualitative picture of fomp turns out to be different from fig.2 . as shown in fig.6a , at @xmath46 re moments",
    "deviate from the axis @xmath28 ( easy direction for tm sublattice ) by the angle @xmath99 .",
    "\\label{a11}\\ ] ] this configuration begins to rotate when including the small magnetic field in the @xmath47 direction . at further increasing the field ,",
    "the nearly collinear spin configuration shown in fig.6b becomes favorable . as follows from ( [ a11 ] )",
    ", fomp is possible at @xmath100 note that the solution ( local minimum ) , corresponding to the non - collinear structure , can vanish with increasing @xmath101 somewhat above the critical field of fomp . a structure of the type fig.6a ( but with ferromagnetic interaction @xmath102 ) was proposed for y@xmath6nd@xmath7co@xmath8 on the basis of magnetic measurements @xcite .",
    "after the jump , the magnetization in the @xmath47 direction continues to increase rather rapidly due to rotation of tm moments ( fig.6b ) , and becomes saturated only when the moments lie along the @xmath47 axis ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "absence of the saturation immediately after the jump corresponds to fomp - ii according to the classification @xcite .",
    "the result of magnetization calculation is shown in fig.7 .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict ourselves again to the plane problem ( @xmath104 plane model ) . the parameter values are chosen to demonstrate existence of the saturation region , although fomp can be obtained for smaller @xmath105 and at smaller @xmath101 too .",
    "the dependence obtained is in a qualitative agreement with that for hofe@xmath2ti @xcite .",
    "this system is close to instability with respect to the formation of the ` easy - cone ' structure @xcite owing to competing ma of ho and fe sublattices with @xmath106 .",
    "to conclude , we have proposed a simple model which reproduces qualitatively the fomp pictures in some re systems with different sign combinations of sublattice ma constants .",
    "it should be noted that the field - induced transitions considered are similar in some respects to the spin - flop transitions in anisotropic antiferromagnets . in the latter situation ,",
    "formation of metastable states and magnetization jumps are possible too ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . however , our picture is more complicated since this includes the tm sublattice .",
    "the consideration performed enables one to avoid some difficulties and reduce the number of fitting parameters in comparison with the treatments that use high - order ma constants .",
    "further experimental investigations of magnetic structures , especially with the use of neutron scattering , would be of interest to verify the fomp scenarios proposed .    when considering the situation in other compounds , we meet with some problems .",
    "the description of fomp for the systems pr@xmath4fe@xmath5b , nd@xmath4fe@xmath107b should also include non - collinear structures @xcite , but this problem is more difficult . in the compound nd@xmath4fe@xmath5b",
    "a conical structure occurs in zero field , although the signs of ma for nd and fe sublattices coincide .",
    "usually such a behavior is attributed to the influence of higher - order anisotropy constants ; possibility of different role of various nd positions is also discussed .",
    "it should be noted that the fomp picture is similar for the compound nd@xmath4co@xmath5b @xcite where the co ions have easy - plane ma . for the system",
    "sm@xmath6nd@xmath7co@xmath8 @xcite the re sublattice already includes two subsystems with opposite ma signs . however , to obtain fomp in spirit of our mechanism one still has to divide this sublattice into two symmetric parts .    the author is grateful to yu.p .",
