    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies detected by the cobe satellite ( bennet et al .",
    "1996 ) confirmed the notion that the present structure in the universe originated from small density fluctuations at early times .",
    "the gravitational collapse of overdense regions could explain the present - day abundance of bound objects , such as galaxies or x - ray clusters , under the appropriate extrapolation of the detected large - scale anisotropies to smaller scales ( e.g. , baugh et al .",
    "1997 ; pen 1996 ) .",
    "recent deep observations with the hubble space telescope ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ) and ground - based telescopes , such as keck ( lowenthal et al . 1996 ) , have constrained considerably the evolution of galaxies and their stellar content at @xmath5 .",
    "however , in the bottom - up hierarchy of the popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies , galaxies were assembled out of building blocks of smaller mass .",
    "the elementary building blocks , i.e. the first gaseous objects to form , had a total mass of order the jeans mass ( @xmath15 ) , below which gas pressure opposed gravity and prevented collapse ( haiman & loeb 1997 ; ostriker & gnedin 1997 ) . in the standard cdm",
    "cosmology , these _ basic _ building blocks formed at @xmath16@xmath17 ( see fig",
    "the _ first light _ from stars and quasars ended the `` dark ages '' of the universe and initiated a `` renaissance of enlightenment '' in the otherwise fading glow of the big bang .",
    "it is easy to see why the mere conversion of trace amounts of gas into stars or black holes at this early epoch could have had a dramatic effect on the ionization state and temperature of the rest of the gas in the universe .",
    "nuclear burning releases @xmath18 ev per hydrogen atom , and thin - disk accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole releases ten times more energy ; however , the ionization of hydrogen requires only 13.6 ev .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to convert a minimum fraction of @xmath19 of the baryonic mass into stars or black holes in order to ionize the rest of the universe .",
    "( the actual required fraction is higher because some of the emitted photons are below 13.6 ev and because each hydrogen atom recombines multiple times at high redshifts ) .",
    "the free electrons produced in this process erase the microwave background anisotropies on angular scales below the size of the horizon at the reionization epoch ( @xmath20 ) , by an amplitude comparable to their optical depth to thomson scattering .",
    "a variety of cdm models that are all consistent with both the cobe anisotropies ( @xmath21 ) and the abundance of objects today ( @xmath22 ) differ appreciably in their initial amplitude of density fluctuations on small scales .",
    "the reionization history of the universe is determined by the collapse redshift of the smallest objects ( @xmath23 ) and is therefore ideally suited to discriminate among these models .",
    "we have not yet observed the first transition that the universe made between its nearly smooth initial state and its clumpy present state .",
    "if i had been asked to envision an instrument that would directly probe this transition epoch , i would have probably sketched something like the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) .",
    "there are three reasons that make this choice natural : ( i ) at @xmath24 , the rest frame optical ",
    "uv emission of star clusters or quasars is redshifted to infrared wavelengths in the observer frame ; ( ii ) the first sources are faint because of their high redshift and low mass .",
    "their detection , therefore , requires a sensitive infrared telescope with a large collecting area , in space .",
    "the last requirement is necessary to avoid atmospheric background / opacity and to reduce the zodiacal background through an extended solar orbit ; and ( iii ) high - redshift objects are likely to be denser and more compact than their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "this simply follows from the increase in the mean density of the universe at early times . in the bottom - up hierarchy of structure formation , this tendency is also enhanced by the decrease of the nonlinear mass scale with redshift .",
    "the physical size of an object of mass @xmath25 should scale roughly as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is its formation redshift .",
    "high angular resolution is therefore required for imaging star clusters at @xmath14 .",
    "the detection of the transition epoch could provide invaluable information about the ionization and star formation history of the universe .",
    "the study of stars at high - redshift is also linked to the `` archeology '' of old stars in the milky way halo .",
    "the metallicity - age trends which are identified in the milky - way galaxy ( mcwilliam et al . 1996 ) should be related to the various epochs of star formation in the early universe .",
    "so much for theoretical arguments .",
    "but is there direct evidence that structure started to form in the universe long before galaxies were assembled ?",
    "the answer is , yes . by now , a number of observational clues constitute a `` smoking gun '' for an early population of stars that had formed at @xmath28 :    * recent spectroscopic observations of the forest at @xmath29 show evidence for a metallicity @xmath4 in absorbers with hi column densities as low as @xmath30 ( cowie  1996 ; songaila  &  cowie  1996 ; tytler  et  al .",
    "numerical simulations identify such absorbers with mildly overdense regions in the intergalactic medium , out of which nonlinear objects such as galaxies condense ( hellstein et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , damped absorbers , which are thought to be the progenitors of present  day galaxies , show similar metallicities during the early phase of their formation , at @xmath31 ( lu , sargent , & barlow 1996 ) .",
    "the universality of this mean metal abundance in absorbers , spanning a range of six orders of magnitude in hi column density , indicates that an early phase of metal enrichment by stars occurred throughout the universe at @xmath28 . *",
    "the lack of complete absorption shortward of the  resonance ( the so - called `` gunn - peterson effect '' ; gunn & peterson 1965 ) in quasar spectra at @xmath32 implies that the intergalactic gas was highly photoionized before that time . on the other hand ,",
    "the bright quasar population has been observed to decline at @xmath29 , and so stellar sources might be necessary to keep the intergalactic gas in its inferred high - ionization state ( shapiro & giroux 1987 ; miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ) . *",
    "microlensing surveys argue that @xmath33 ( instead of the previously known range of 0100% ! ) of the mass of the halo of the milky way galaxy might be in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) with a mass @xmath34 ( alcock et al .",
    "it remains to be seen whether future microlensing studies confirm these early reports .",
    "a stellar population that forms before galaxies are assembled , would behave as collisionless matter and populate the halos of galaxies like cold dark matter ( cdm ) particles do .    in this review",
    "i will describe the properties of the first stars and quasars and their effect on the ionization history of the universe .",
    "much of the quantitative details of this sketch can be found in a series of papers that i wrote in collaboration with my student , zoltan haiman .",
    "the underlying theme of these papers was to calibrate the net fraction of gas that is converted into stars based on the measured c / h ratio in the forest .",
    "this calibration fixes the reionization history for a given stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and a particular cdm cosmology .",
    "the various stages in the reionization history of the universe are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "this sequence follows the collapse redshift history of baryonic objects shown in figure 1 , which was calculated with a spherically - symmetric code for gas and dark matter ( haiman , thoul , & loeb 1996 ) . for objects with baryonic masses @xmath35",
    ", gravity dominates and results in the characteristic bottom - up hierarchy of cdm cosmologies . at lower masses ,",
    "gas pressure delays the collapse and results in a top - down hierarchy , reminiscent of hot dark matter cosmologies .",
    "the first objects to collapse are located at the `` knee '' that separates these regimes .",
    "such objects reach virial temperatures of several hundred degrees and could fragment into stars only through cooling by molecular hydrogen [ see haiman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) or tegmark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , for details regarding the chemistry network leading to the formation of @xmath36 in a primordial gas ] .",
    "however , @xmath36 is fragile and could easily be photo - dissociated by photons with energies of @xmath37@xmath38ev , to which the universe is transparent even before it gets ionized .",
    "haiman , rees , & loeb ( 1996 ) showed that a uv flux of @xmath39 is capable of dissociating @xmath36 throughout the collapsed environments in the universe .",
    "this flux is lower by @xmath40 orders of magnitude than the minimum flux necessary to ionize the universe , which amounts to one uv photon per baryon .",
    "the inevitable conclusion is that soon after the first stars form , the formation of more stars due to @xmath41 cooling is suppressed .",
    "further fragmentation is possible only through atomic line cooling , which is effective in objects with high virial temperatures , @xmath42k .",
    "such objects correspond to a total mass @xmath43^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "figure 2 illustrates this sequence of events by describing two classes of objects : those with @xmath44k ( small dots ) and those with @xmath45k ( large dots ) . in the first stage ( top panel )",
    ", some low - mass objects collapse , form stars , and create ionized hydrogen ( hii ) bubbles around them .",
    "once the uv background between 11.213.6ev reaches some critical level , @xmath41 is photo - dissociated throughout the universe and the formation of new stars is delayed until objects with @xmath42k collapse .",
    "each massive source creates an hii region which expands into the intergalactic medium .",
    "initially the volume of the universe is dominated by neutral hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "but as new sources appear exponentially fast ( due to the gaussian nature of the perturbations ) , numerous hii bubbles add up , overlap , and transform all the remaining hi into hii over a short period of time .",
    "this process resembles a first - order phase transition . since the characteristic separation between sources is eventually very much smaller than the hubble distance , the transition completes over a period of time which is much shorter than the hubble time , and can be regarded as sudden .    because the potential wells of the first clusters are relatively shallow ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) , supernova  driven winds are likely to have expelled the metal  rich gas out of these systems and mixed it with the intergalactic medium .",
    "incomplete mixing could have led to the observed order - of - magnitude scatter in the c / h ratio along lines - of - sight to different quasars ( rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz 1996 ; hellsten  et  al .",
    "it is an interesting coincidence that the supernova energy output associated with a metal enrichment of @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath10 ev per hydrogen atom , which is just above the binding energy of these early star clusters .",
    "supernova feedback in these objects could have therefore dictated the average metallicity observed in the forest .",
    "direct observations of these supernovae might be feasible in the future ( miralda - escud & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the measured c / h ratio can be used to calibrate the net fraction of gas that is converted into stars by a redshift @xmath48 . for a scalo ( 1986 )",
    "imf of stars , this corresponds to converting @xmath49 of all the gas into stars of the gas in each object formed stars or whether a small fraction of all objects formed stars with a higher efficiency .",
    "we assume that supernova feedback limits star formation to a single starburst and sets the efficiency of star formation to @xmath50 in all objects . in the alternative scenario",
    ", ngst should see fewer but brighter sources . ] .",
    "haiman & loeb ( 1997 ) have used this fraction and an extension of the press ",
    "schechter formalism to calculate the early star formation history in a variety of cdm cosmologies .",
    "we combined the collapse redshift information in figure 1 with the press - schechter theory and assumed that each object converts a fixed fraction of its gas into stars in a single starburst .",
    "we then used the spectral atlases of kurucz ( 1993 ) and the stellar evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to find the emission spectrum of the stars as a function of redshift .",
    "the ionizing radiation from each star cluster was absorbed in part by the gas in it ( assumed to be distributed as a singular isothermal sphere at the virial temperature ) and then propagated into a smooth intergalactic medium ( igm ) , using the radiative transfer equations in an expanding universe .    for a wide range of models and a scalo imf ,",
    "we have found that the universe is reionized by a redshift @xmath920 , and that the resulting optical depth to electron scattering is @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "this result changes qualitatively only if the imf is tilted by a power - law index @xmath51 relative to the scalo shape ( a bias towards high mass stars is likely due to the lack of cooling by metals and the associated increase in the jeans mass ) .",
    "the sensitivity to model parameters other than the imf is only logarithmic because of the exponential dependence of the collapsed baryonic fraction on redshift for gaussian fluctuations .",
    "however , the formation time of cdm halos has a very weak dependence on mass scale at low masses , and it is not obvious whether the press - schechter approach is accurate in this limit . three - dimensional simulations ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) find reionization somewhat later , at @xmath52 , based on a significantly different star formation history than the our semi - analytic approach predicts .",
    "future microwave anisotropy satellites , such as the microwave anisotropy probe ( map ) or the planck surveyor , could detect a reionization optical depth as low as 2% or 0.5% respectively after processing their polarization data ( zaldarriaga , spergel , & seljak 1997 ) , and will therefore test these predictions .    deep imaging with future infrared telescopes , such as the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) or the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) , would be able to image pre  galactic star clusters . for standard cdm with @xmath53 and a scalo imf , haiman & loeb ( 1997 )",
    "predict that ngst should find @xmath54 star clusters per square arcminute at @xmath55 , given its planned detection threshold of 1 njy in the wavelength range of 13.5  @xmath56 m ( mather & stockman 1996 ) .",
    "the characteristic separation between such sources is a few arcseconds , much larger than their typical size of @xmath57 .",
    "the early epoch of star formation and metal enrichment is inevitably accompanied by the formation of dust in type ii supernova shells .",
    "this dust has two important observational signatures .",
    "first , the absorption of starlight energy and its re  emission at long wavelengths distorts the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( wright et al .",
    "1994 , and references therein ) .",
    "second , the opacity of the intergalactic medium to infrared sources at redshifts @xmath14 could be significant . for these redshifts ,",
    "infrared in the observer frame corresponds to uv in the source frame  a spectral regime in which dust absorption peaks .",
    "dust obscuration must therefore be considered when predicting the performance of future infrared telescopes such as ngst .",
    "loeb & haiman ( 1997a ) find that for a scalo imf and a uniform mix of metals and dust with the intergalactic gas , the dust distorts the microwave background spectrum by a @xmath58parameter in the range @xmath59@xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the average mass of dust produced per supernova .",
    "note that this range is not far below the current cobe limit of @xmath62 ( fixsen et al .",
    "the opacity of intergalactic dust to infrared sources at redshifts @xmath14 is significant , @xmath63@xmath64 , and could be detected with ngst .",
    "although dust suppresses the ly@xmath65 emission from early sources , the redshifts of star clusters at @xmath935 can be easily inferred from the lyman - limit break in their infrared spectrum between 13.5@xmath56 m ( see fig .",
    "as mentioned before , recent microlensing searches ( alcock et al . 1996 ) suggest that @xmath33 of the mass of the milky - way halo might be in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) with a mass @xmath34 . a substantial macho population of dim stars",
    "would naturally be linked to the early universe .",
    "pre - galactic stars which originate in abundant low - mass systems are expected to behave as collisionless particles and populate the halos of galaxies , just as elementary cdm particles do . only stars which are born in massive rare ( high@xmath66 ) peaks",
    "are more likely to end up concentrated in galactic bulges due to the strong dynamical friction which acts on their parent systems . in general",
    ", dim stars could constitute the dark matter in galaxy clusters only if @xmath67 and the efficiency of converting gas into these stars is of order 80% .",
    "recent observations of the star formation history at @xmath68 might account for most of the luminous stellar population in galaxies today ( madau 1996 ) .",
    "however , it is important to remember that this population amounts only to a density parameter @xmath69 ( woods & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , if stellar machos make the dark matter with @xmath70 , then we have not observed yet @xmath71 of the star formation history in the universe .",
    "ngst could easily detect stellar machos during their earlier history when they were still bright due to hydrogen burning .",
    "for example , chabrier et al . ( 1996 ) and adams & laughlin ( 1996 ) have argued that an old population of white dwarfs could account for the microlensing data and still be consistent with metallicity , star counts , and infrared background constraints , as long as their imf was highly peaked around @xmath72 . but a @xmath73 star has a lifetime @xmath74 gyr during which it is more than an order of magnitude brighter than the sun . even if these stars formed at arbitrarily early times , the age of the universe is only @xmath75gyr at @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the halos of galaxies at @xmath77 should be _ glowing _ in the infrared if dim white dwarfs constitute the dark matter in the present universe .",
    "existing hubble deep field observations ( guzmn et al . 1997 ) already place constraints on the extent of luminous halos around galaxies ( loeb & pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "however , optical observations probe the rest - frame uv and do not see the bulk of the stellar population .",
    "infrared observations with ngst would improve dramatically our ability to set constraints on unusual stellar populations in the halos of galaxies .",
    "most of the current theoretical modeling of star formation was developed to explain the complex properties of star forming regions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of our galaxy .",
    "the reason for this bias is obvious : these are the environments for which data exists !",
    "the situation resembles a search for a needle in a haystack , just because the haystack happens to be nearby .",
    "an alternative strategy is to invest ( nasa ) money in a long - range mission and search for the needle in simpler environments .",
    "i would like to argue that the formation process of the first generation of stars in the early universe should be easier to model than that of stars in the local ism .",
    "this follows from the fact that the initial conditions in cosmology are simpler and better - defined : ( i ) the universe started from a smooth initial state and a specified spectrum of fluctuations on top of it ; many details of this spectrum will be determined by forthcoming microwave anisotropy experiments ; ( ii ) the composition of the gas is well defined by standard big - bang nucleosynthesis ( schramm & turner 1996 ) , and the chemistry and cooling rates are simplified by the lack of heavy elements , dust , or cosmic rays ; and ( iii ) magnetic fields were probably negligible before stars formed ; most cosmological scenarios result in small field amplitudes ( sigl et al .",
    "1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "due solely to lack of data , theoretical studies of the formation of the first stars are sparse in the literature .",
    "direct imaging and spectroscopy of the first stars by ngst could stimulate theoretical work on the simplest environment for star formation , namely the early universe .",
    "the era of classical cosmology will end if the map and planck satellites determine the basic cosmological parameters to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "since much of observational cosmology relies on starlight , cosmologists might then find it appropriate to shift their attention to the fundamental problem of star formation ; and there is no better place to start dealing with it than the early universe .",
    "extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function ( pei 1995 ) to redshifts @xmath28 predicts a noticeable tail of faint sources that could be detected with ngst out to the reionization epoch ( loeb & haiman 1997b ) . if these sources are brighter than the first star clusters , it would be easier to measure their absorption spectra and use them to determine the reionization redshift beyond which the gunn - peterson effect appears .",
    "bearing in mind that quasars can account for a considerable fraction of the uv background at lower redshifts ( meiksin & madau 1993 ) , it is quite possible that early _ low - luminosity _ quasars were in fact responsible for the reionization of the universe .",
    "quasars could be more effective than stars in ionizing the universe because : ( i ) their emission spectrum is harder ; ( ii ) the radiative efficiency of accretion flows could be more than an order of magnitude higher than that of a star ; ( iii ) quasars are brighter , and for a given recombination rate in their host system , the escape fraction of their ionizing photons is higher than for stars .    first , let us address the black hole formation process . to form a black hole inside a given dark matter halo , the baryons must cool . for most objects ,",
    "this is possible only due to atomic line cooling ( see  2 ) , at virial temperatures , @xmath42k , and baryonic masses @xmath78^{3/2}$ ] . after losing their thermal pressure",
    ", the cold baryons collapse to a thin disk on a dynamical time ( loeb & rasio 1994 ) .",
    "the basic question is then : which fraction of the cold baryons are able to sink to the very center of the potential well and form a massive black hole ?",
    "the main barrier to this process is angular momentum .",
    "the centrifugal force opposes radial infall and keeps the gas in typical disks at a distance which is 6 - 8 orders of magnitude larger than the schwarzschild radius of the system .",
    "however , eisenstein & loeb ( 1995 ) have demonstrated that a small fraction of all objects have a sufficiently low angular momentum so that the gas in them inevitably forms a compact semi - relativistic disk that evolves to a black hole on a short viscous time .",
    "these low - spin systems are born in special cosmological environments that exert unusually small tidal toques on them during their cosmological collapse . as long as the initial cooling time of",
    "the gas is short and its star formation efficiency is low , the gas would form this compact disk on a free - fall time . in typical systems",
    "the baryons dominate gravity inside the scale length of the disk . therefore",
    ", if the baryons in a low - spin system acquire a specific angular momentum @xmath79 which is only a tenth of the typical value , then the size of the resulting disk ( @xmath80 ) will be smaller by a factor of @xmath81 than average , and the rotation velocity of the disk will be a factor of @xmath10 larger than the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo . for @xmath82k ,",
    "the dark matter halo has a velocity dispersion of @xmath83 , and the low - spin disk would have a characteristic rotation velocity of @xmath84 ( sufficient to retain the gas against supernova - driven winds ) , a size @xmath85 pc , and a viscous evolution time shorter than the hubble time . if a low - spin object of this type is embedded inside an overdense region that will eventually become a galactic bulge , the black hole progenitor would eventually sink to the center of the bulge by dynamical friction and seed quasar activity .",
    "based on the phase - space volume accesible to low - spin systems ( @xmath86 ) , one would expect a fraction @xmath87 of all the mass in the universe to be included in such systems ( eisenstein & loeb 1995 ) . however , this is a conservative estimate .",
    "additional angular momentum loss due to dynamical friction of gaseous clumps in dark matter halos ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) or bar instabilities in self - gravitating disks ( shlosman , begelman , & frank 1990 ) could only make the black hole formation process more prominent .",
    "the popular paradigm that all galaxies harbor black holes at their center ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ) simply _ postulates _ that in all massive systems , a small fraction of the gas ends up as a black hole , but does not explain quantitatively why this fraction obtains its particular small value .    observations of galactic nuclei in the local universe imply black hole masses which are typically a fraction @xmath88 of the total baryonic mass of their host ( see summary of dynamical estimates in fig .",
    "5 of kormendy et al . 1997 ; and the maximum ratio between a quasar luminosity and its host mass found by mcleod 1997 ) .",
    "this ratio is somewhat higher in low - mass galaxies , such as the compact ellipticals m32 and ngc 4486b . in particular ,",
    "van der marel et al . (",
    "1997 ) infer a black hole mass of @xmath89 in m32 , which is a fraction @xmath90 of the stellar mass of the galaxy , @xmath91 , for the central mass - to - light ratio of @xmath92 ; while kormendy et al .",

    "such objects are @xmath10njy stellar sources for ngst .",
    "we assume that each such object forms a black hole with an efficiency , since the central density of the host galaxy grows as @xmath98 while its spin parameter has a negligible dependence on redshift .",

    "if the black hole shines at a fraction @xmath101 of the eddington limit with a characteristic quasar spectrum , then its infrared flux at @xmath16 would be @xmath102 njy .",
    "such a flux is comparable to the emission from the host star cluster and would easily be detected with ngst .- ray bursts could reach much higher luminosities in the first month@xmath103 of the burst ( groot et al .",

    "this fraction can be explained in terms of the ratio between the eddington time and the current hubble time .",
    "a black hole which shines at a luminosity @xmath101 in eddington units would double its mass on a timescale , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the radiative efficiency of the black hole in units of @xmath105 . since the black hole mass , @xmath108 , grows exponentially with the eddington @xmath109-folding time ,",
    "the characteristic lifetime of the quasar activity is several times @xmath110 , namely @xmath111 of the current hubble time .",
    "but notice that for a fixed radiative efficiency , _ the quasar lifetime is independent of redshift _ while the hubble time is shorter at high redshift .",
    "for a flat universe , the ratio between @xmath110 and the hubble time @xmath112 is , @xmath113^{3/2 } \\epsilon_{0.1}{\\tilde l}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "therefore several tenths of all star clusters might show nuclear activity at @xmath16 .",
    "based on these numbers we infer that quasars would dominate the uv background during reionization if the fraction of gas converted to black holes is @xmath114 .",
    "we have suggested that the formation efficiency of black holes in low - mass galaxies at @xmath16 is similar to that found in galaxies in the local universe .",

    "<S> the redshift of all sources can be determined from the lyman - limit break in their spectrum , which overlaps with the ngst wavelength regime , 1@xmath12 m , for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> absorption spectra of the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the reionization history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the intergalactic medium might show a significant opacity to infrared sources at @xmath14 due to dust produced by the first supernovae . </S>"
