    "let @xmath0 be a finite quiver without oriented cycles .",
    "let @xmath1 be an algebraically closed field .",
    "the main result in this paper is that there is a natural bijection between the elements in the associated weyl group @xmath2 and the cofinite additive quotient closed subcategories of the category @xmath4 of finite dimensional right modules over the path algebra @xmath3 . here",
    "a subcategory @xmath5 in @xmath4 is called cofinite if there are only a finite number of indecomposable modules of @xmath4 which are not in @xmath5 . from now on , when we refer to subcategories , we mean full , additive subcategories .",
    "the natural bijection is given via the following map .",
    "let @xmath5 be a cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 .",
    "we label the vertices of @xmath0 by @xmath6 so that if @xmath7 are the corresponding projective modules , then @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "list the indecomposable modules not in @xmath5 , starting with the projective ones , with indices in increasing order , then similarly for @xmath10 , etc . , where @xmath11 denotes the ar - translation .",
    "the sequence of modules gives rise to a word @xmath12 by replacing @xmath13 by the simple reflection @xmath14 of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is the quiver @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the indecomposable modules of a quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 , then the missing indecomposables in the required order are @xmath17 .",
    "the associated word is therefore @xmath18 .",
    "conversely , starting with an element @xmath12 of length @xmath19 , we describe explicitly how to find the @xmath19 indecomposable @xmath3-modules which are not in the corresponding quotient closed subcategory .",
    "our method for proving this correspondence is to work with the preprojective algebra @xmath20 associated to @xmath0 . for each element @xmath12 in @xmath2",
    ", there is an associated ideal @xmath21 in @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) , such that @xmath22 is a finite dimensional algebra .",
    "we associate to @xmath21 the subcategory @xmath23 .",
    "this is a subcategory of @xmath24 , the preprojective @xmath3-modules .",
    "we show that the additive category generated by @xmath25 together with the regular and preinjective @xmath3-modules is quotient closed and coincides with the subcategory corresponding as above to @xmath12 in @xmath2 ; we also show that any cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 is of this form . in our proofs",
    ", we have to distinguish between the dynkin and non - dynkin cases , with the dynkin case being the more complicated one . to get the flavour of our results , the reader might prefer on a first reading to skip sections  [ sectionfive ] and [ sectionsix ] , which deal with the dynkin case .    for the most part , in this paper , we work over an algebraically closed ground field .",
    "this is necessary because of our reliance on @xcite , which makes this assumption .",
    "however , using the technology of _ frobenius maps _ , we show that our main result extends to arbitrary finite dimensional hereditary algebras over finite fields .",
    "another interesting subcategory of @xmath4 associated to an element @xmath12 in @xmath2 is @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath0 is dynkin , we use our main theorem to show that the map from @xmath12 to @xmath26 is a bijection from @xmath2 to the subclosed subcategories of @xmath4 . in the general case ,",
    "we conjecture that there is a correspondence between the elements of @xmath2 and a certain specific subclass of the subclosed subcategories containing finitely many indecomposables .",
    "the correspondence @xmath27 was already investigated in a special case in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this gives a bijection between a special class of elements of @xmath2 called @xmath28-sortable @xcite and torsion - free subcategories of @xmath4 with a finite number of indecomposable objects .",
    "( such a bijection had previously been constructed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.3 ) . )    by analogy , it would be interesting to describe the elements @xmath12 of @xmath2 such that @xmath25 is a torsion class .",
    "also , given such an element @xmath12 , one might wish to determine the element of @xmath2 corresponding to the associated torsion - free class .",
    "we solve these problems for finite type , and we state a conjecture for the general case .",
    "quotient closed subcategories have not been extensively studied previously , though torsion classes are an important and well - studied special case .",
    "the dual concept , that of subclosed subcategories , arises in recent work of ringel @xcite and of krause and prest @xcite .",
    "in particular , he has dealt with subclosed subcategories of infinite type , and has shown that any infinite subclosed subcategory of finite dimensional modules over a finite dimensional algebra contains a minimal infinite such subcategory .",
    "his work was motivated by previous work on the gabriel - roiter measure .    the inclusion order on cofinite quotient - closed subcategories transfers over to give a partial order on the weyl group @xmath29 .",
    "this partial order was first studied by armstrong @xcite , under the name of `` sorting order '' .",
    "part of our motivation for this paper was to provide a representation - theoretic interpretation for this family of partial orders .",
    "one of the referees raised a similar question : how could one transfer the group structure on @xmath29 to the collection of cofinite quotient - closed subcategories ?",
    "this is an interesting question , which we are not able to answer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we give some essential background material , and we state our main theorem giving a bijection between elements of @xmath2 and cofinite , quotient closed subcategories of @xmath4 . in section",
    "3 we establish preliminary results on subfunctors of @xmath30 and on interpretations of reflection functors , which are important for the proof of the main result .",
    "we show in section  4 that @xmath21 is determined by @xmath25 in the non dynkin case , and in section  5 that @xmath22 is determined by @xmath26 in the dynkin case . in section  6",
    "we give some more results when @xmath0 is a dynkin quiver , including the relationship between subcategories of the form @xmath26 and those of the form @xmath31 the proof of the main theorem is given in section  7 . in section  8",
    "we extend our main theorem to give a bijection between arbitrary quotient closed subcategories of @xmath24 and a suitable class of possibly infinite words . in section  9",
    "we extend our main theorem to cover cofinite quotient closed subcategories of representations of hereditary algebras which are finite dimensional over a finite field . in section  10",
    "we deal with the categories @xmath32 and show that they are exactly the subclosed subcategories in the dynkin case .",
    "we also state a conjecture for the non - dynkin case . in section  11",
    "we investigate when the categories @xmath25 are torsion classes , and how to describe the associated torsion - free classes in that case . we give a complete answer in the dynkin case , and state a conjecture in the general case . in section  12",
    "we show how our main theorem can be used to recover the characterization by postnikov @xcite in terms of @xmath33-diagrams of the leftmost reduced subwords ( equivalently , positive distinguished subexpressions ) in the type @xmath34 grassmannian permutations .",
    "we discuss the connections to the work of armstrong , mentioned above , in section  13 .",

    "we thank the referees for their helpful comments , and especially for asking what could be said over ground fields which are not algebraically closed .",
    "in this section we state our main results , and give relevant background material and an example for illustration .",
    "let @xmath0 be a quiver without oriented cycles and with vertices @xmath35 , and let @xmath1 be an algebraically closed field",
    ". denote by @xmath3 the associated path algebra .",
    "the weyl group @xmath36 associated to @xmath0 has a distinguished set of generators @xmath37 , with relations @xmath38 ( the identity element ) , @xmath39 if there is no arrow between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 if there is exactly one arrow between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for an element @xmath12 in @xmath43 , an expression @xmath44 ( called a _ word _ )",
    "is said to be _ reduced _ if @xmath19 is as small as possible . in this case , @xmath45 is the _ length _ of @xmath12 .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ two.one ] there is a natural bijection between the elements in the weyl group @xmath2 and the cofinite ( additive ) quotient closed subcategories of the category @xmath4 of finitely generated @xmath3-modules .",
    "the following observation shows that we can equally well consider the cofinite quotient closed subcategories of the category @xmath24 of preprojective @xmath3-modules .",
    "any cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 contains all the non - preprojective indecomposable @xmath3-modules .",
    "further , any cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath24 can be extended to a cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 by taking the additive subcategory generated by it together with all the non - preprojective indecomposable @xmath3-modules .    for @xmath0 dynkin , @xmath46 , so there is nothing to prove .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is not dynkin , and let @xmath47 be an additive cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath4 . since @xmath48 is cofinite , @xmath49 is in @xmath50 for @xmath40 sufficiently large .",
    "since @xmath50 is quotient closed and @xmath51 preserves epimorphisms , it follows that @xmath50 contains the regular and preinjective indecomposables of @xmath4 .",
    "this proves the first point .",
    "now suppose that @xmath5 is a cofinite , quotient closed subcategory of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the additive subcategory of @xmath4 generated by @xmath5 together with all the non - preprojective indecomposable objects of @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , @xmath52 is cofinite in @xmath4 , and it is quotient closed because there are no non - zero maps from a regular or preinjective module to an object of @xmath24 .",
    "we introduce some more terminology in order to state the main theorem more explicitly .",
    "let @xmath5 be a cofinite , quotient closed subcategory of @xmath24 , and let @xmath53 be the finite set of indecomposable preprojective modules not in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath7 be an ordering of the indecomposable projective @xmath3-modules , compatible with the orientation of @xmath0 , that is , such that if @xmath54 then @xmath55 .",
    "consider the ordering @xmath56 of the indecomposable preprojective @xmath3-modules , dropping any @xmath13 which are zero .    from this ,",
    "we get an induced ordering on @xmath53 .",
    "we replace each module in @xmath53 of the form @xmath13 for some @xmath40 , by @xmath14 , thereby obtaining a word @xmath57 associated to the subcategory @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , start with an element @xmath58 .",
    "consider the infinite word @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is what is called a _",
    "coxeter element_. we match the reflections in @xmath61 with the indecomposable objects in @xmath24 , so that the first @xmath62 corresponds to @xmath63 , the second to @xmath64 , and so on .",
    "now , among all the reduced expressions @xmath65 in @xmath61 for @xmath12 , we choose the leftmost one , in the sense that @xmath66 is as far to the left as possible in @xmath67 , and , among such expressions , @xmath68 is as far to the left as possible ( but to the right of @xmath66 ) , and so on for each @xmath69 .",
    "in this way , we determine a unique subword @xmath57 of @xmath67 .",
    "consider the associated set @xmath53 of indecomposable preprojective modules corresponding to this subword , as discussed above .",
    "then we associate to @xmath12 the additive subcategory @xmath5 of @xmath24 , whose indecomposable objects are the indecomposable objects of @xmath24 which do not lie in @xmath53 .",
    "we can now state the following more explicit version of our main theorem :    [ two.two ] there is a bijective correspondence between elements @xmath58 and cofinite quotient closed subcategories of @xmath24 , which can be described as follows :    * the correspondence @xmath70 is given by removing from @xmath24 the indecomposable modules corresponding to the leftmost word @xmath57 for @xmath12 in @xmath61 . * the correspondence @xmath71 is given by taking the finite set @xmath53 of indecomposable preprojective modules not in @xmath5 , and associating to it a word as described above .    in order to prove these results",
    ", we work with the preprojective algebra @xmath72 associated to @xmath3 .",
    "for each arrow @xmath73 in @xmath3 , add an arrow @xmath74 in the opposite direction to get a new quiver @xmath75 .",
    "then , by definition , @xmath76 we write @xmath77 for the category of finitely generated right @xmath20-modules , and @xmath78 for the category of all right @xmath20-modules .",
    "let @xmath79 be the idempotent corresponding to the vertex @xmath40 .",
    "then consider the ideal @xmath80 in @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath44 is a reduced expression for @xmath81 , then @xmath21 is ( well-)defined by @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "( note that the product of ideals is taken in the opposite order to the product of reflections in @xmath57 .",
    "this follows the convention of @xcite . )",
    "any @xmath20-module , like @xmath21 , is a @xmath3-module by restriction .",
    "consider the subcategory @xmath25 of @xmath77 , whose indecomposable modules are those which appear as indecomposable summands of @xmath21 as a @xmath3-module .",
    "we then have the following :    [ two.three ] the cofinite quotient closed subcategory of @xmath24 which corresponds to @xmath81 under the bijection of theorem  [ two.two ] can also be described as @xmath25 .",

    "then any reading order which respects the ar - quiver , will yield a reduced word for @xmath342 which differs from the standard word by a sequence of commutations of commuting reflections .",
    "it follows that the leftmost reduced words for any reading order which respects the ar - quiver will correspond to quotient - closed subcategories in exactly the same way .",
    "in particular , for any @xmath684 , we can take a reading order which begins by reading the reflections in the corresponding partition along lines sloping from bottom left to top right , followed by reading the remaining reflections in @xmath371 and the reflections in the two triangles in any order compatible with the ar - quiver .",
    "the result is a word for @xmath342 which begins with a word for @xmath12 .    by theorem [ two.two ] ,",
    "leftmost reduced words inside @xmath12 therefore correspond to quotient - closed subcategories of @xmath3-mod which contain all the indecomposables outside the partition corresponding to @xmath12 .",
    "we have therefore reduced the combinatorial problem of classifying leftmost reduced words inside @xmath12 to the problem of classifying quotient - closed subcategories which contain all the indecomposables outside a partition @xmath694 .",
    "we say that a subcategory has a bad @xmath33 if there is some indecomposable @xmath163 in @xmath371 which is missing from the subcategory , such that the subcategory contains an object on the line of morphisms leading to @xmath163 from the top right , and an object on the line of morphisms leading to @xmath163 from the bottom left .",
    "we will therefore recover postnikov s result once we have established the following proposition :    the quotient - closed subcategories of @xmath3-mod which contain all the indecomposables outside @xmath694 are exactly those which have no bad @xmath33 inside @xmath694 .",
    "suppose that a subcategory @xmath491 has a bad @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath491 is missing some indecomposable @xmath163 , and contains an indecomposable @xmath292 on the line of morphisms leading to @xmath163 from the top right , and an indecomposable @xmath209 on the line of morphisms leading to @xmath163 from the bottom right .",
    "it is easy to see that there is an epimorphism @xmath702 .",

    "it is easy to see that this is only possible if @xmath491 has a bad @xmath33 with @xmath163 at the corner , since all the irreducible morphisms inside @xmath371 are monomorphisms .    for this choice of @xmath0",
    ", it is possible to use the same approach to describe the explicit combinatorics of the leftmost reduced words inside the word for @xmath342 which is obtained by replacing the indecomposables in the ar - quiver by the corresponding simple reflections , and then reading them in any order compatible with the ar - quiver .",
    "specifically , we have the following representation - theoretic result :    a subcategory @xmath491 of @xmath3 is quotient - closed provided that :    * @xmath491 has no bad @xmath33 inside @xmath371 . *",
    "if any indecomposable from @xmath371 appears in @xmath491 , then so do all the elements of @xmath695 on the same diagonal running from bottom left to top right , and so do all the elements of @xmath696 on the same diagonal running from top left to bottom right .",
    "* along any line of morphisms running from bottom left to top right , if any indecomposable from @xmath695 is in @xmath491 , all subsequent indecomposables along the diagonal also lie in @xmath491 . * along any line of morphisms running from top left to bottom right , if any indecomposable from @xmath696 is in @xmath491 , all subsequent indecomposables along the diagonal also lie in @xmath491 .",
    "we leave the proof of these elementary facts to the reader .    by theorem [ two.two ] , this yields the following consequence .",
    "we think of the simple reflections in our word for @xmath342 as positioned at the vertices of the ar - quiver . in particular",
    ", this means that where one usually refers to rows and columns , we will refer to diagonals .",
    "a leftmost reduced word inside @xmath342 is one which has the following properties :    * it has no bad @xmath33 inside the reflections coming from @xmath371 , * if any simple reflection @xmath703 inside @xmath371 is skipped , then all subsequent reflections in @xmath695 and @xmath696 on the diagonals through that @xmath703 must also be skipped . *",
    "if any simple reflection @xmath703 inside @xmath695 is skipped , then all subsequent reflections inside @xmath695 on the same upward - pointing diagonal must be skipped , * if any simple reflection @xmath703 inside @xmath696 is skipped , then all subsequent reflections inside @xmath696 on the same downward - pointing diagonal must be skipped .",
    "in this section , we explain the link to armstrong s work @xcite , which provided the initial motivation for our investigations . we restrict to the case that @xmath0 is dynkin for simplicity ; on the whole , that is the setting in which combinatorialists have worked .",
    "let @xmath603 be a finite ground set and let @xmath5 be a collection of subsets of @xmath603 .",
    "the sets in @xmath5 are referred to as _",
    "feasible _ sets .",
    "we say that the set system @xmath5 is _ accessible _ if , for every @xmath704 , there exists some @xmath705 such that @xmath706 .",
    "an antimatroid is called _ supersolvable _",
    "@xcite , if @xmath603 is equipped with a total order such that , if @xmath711 in @xmath5 , with @xmath708 , then @xmath712 , where @xmath480 is the minimum element of @xmath701 not in @xmath34 ( with respect to the total order ) .    let @xmath29 be a coxeter group , which we assume to be finite .",
    "fix an arbitrary word @xmath713 in the simple reflections of @xmath29 . for @xmath474 , consider the subwords of @xmath490 which define reduced words for @xmath382 , and , if there is at least one such subword , define @xmath714 to be the subset of @xmath715 corresponding to the positions occupied by the leftmost such word . then define @xmath716 to consist of the collection of all the @xmath714 ( for those @xmath382 such that @xmath714 is defined ) .",
    "one of the main results of @xcite , theorem 4.4 , says that @xmath716 is a supersolvable antimatroid ( with respect to the usual order on the ground set @xmath715 ) .",
    "using our results , we can recover this result of armstrong for particular choices of word @xmath490 .",
    "suppose that @xmath29 is a simply - laced weyl group , so that it corresponds to a dynkin diagram .",
    "choose an arbitrary orientation for the diagram , obtaining a quiver @xmath0 .",
    "now consider the word for the element @xmath717 obtained by reading the ar - quiver for @xmath3 , as described in section 2 .",
    "we call this word @xmath718 .",
    "using our correspondence between leftmost words and quotient closed subcategories , @xmath719 iff @xmath34 is the set of indecomposables missing from a quotient closed subcategory of @xmath3-mod . in this case",
    "we write @xmath720 for the corresponding quotient closed subcategory .",

    "let @xmath480 be the first indecomposable ( with respect to our fixed total order ) in @xmath701 which is not in @xmath34 . to show that @xmath722 is a supersolvable antimatroid",
    ", we must show that @xmath723 .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that @xmath480 can be removed from the quotient closed category @xmath720 , without destroying quotient closedness .    to see this ,",
    "write @xmath163 for the full subcategory of @xmath4 whose indecomposable objects properly precede @xmath480 in our fixed total order . since @xmath724 , we know that @xmath480 is not a quotient of any object of @xmath725 . since @xmath480 is the first element of @xmath701 not in @xmath34 , the indecomposable objects of @xmath701 which precede @xmath480 all lie in @xmath34 .",
