    "we focus our attention on @xmath10 with the form @xmath17(x ) : = \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n } [ u(x + z ) - u(x ) ] k_\\epsilon(z)dz , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , for @xmath18 fixed , @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20    notice that for each @xmath2 , @xmath19 is integrable in @xmath21 with @xmath22 norm equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a constant depending only on @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we point out that operators with kernel in @xmath22 , like @xmath10 , are known in the literature as _ zero order nonlocal operators_.    operator @xmath10 is a particular case of a broad class of nonlocal elliptic operators .",
    "in fact , given a positive measure @xmath27 satisfying the _ lvy condition _ @xmath28 and , for each @xmath29 and @xmath30 bounded and sufficiently smooth at @xmath31 , the operator @xmath32(x)$ ] defined as @xmath33(x ) =   \\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^n } [ u(x + z ) - u(x ) - \\mathbf{1}_{b_1(0)}(z ) \\langle du(x ) , z \\rangle]\\mu(dz),\\ ] ] has been a subject of study in a huge variety of contexts such as potential theory ( @xcite ) , probability ( @xcite ) and analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting point of view of our problem comes from probability , since   represents the infinitesimal generator of a _ jump lvy process _ , see sato  @xcite . in our setting ,",
    "the finiteness of the measure is associated with the so - called _ compound poisson process_. dirichlet problems with the form of  - arise in the context of exit time problems with trajectories driven by the jump lvy process defined by @xmath34 , and the solution @xmath7 represents the expected value of the associated cost functional , see  @xcite .",
    "we may start our discussion with a natural notion of solution to our problem  - : we say that a bounded function @xmath30 , continuous in @xmath35 , is a solution of  - if it satisfies pointwise in @xmath35 and @xmath36 on @xmath37 .",
    "as we see in section  2 , this problem has a unique solution , more interestingly , through an example we will see that such a solution may not be continuous in @xmath21 , since a discontinuity may appear on the boundary of @xmath35 . see remark  [ rmku>0borde ] .",
    "this situation is in great contrast with the limit case @xmath38 , where the kernel becomes @xmath39 and the associated nonlocal operator is the _ fractional laplacian of order @xmath40 _ , denoted by @xmath41 , see  @xcite . in this case , the corresponding dirichlet problem becomes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a normalizing constant .",
    "in the context of the viscosity theory for nonlocal equations ( see  @xcite ) , barles , chasseigne and imbert  @xcite addressed a large variety of nonlocal elliptic problems including  . in that paper , the authors proved the existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution @xmath44 of   satisfying @xmath45 on @xmath13 that is , consequently , continuous when we regard it as a function on @xmath21 .",
    "this result is accomplished by the use of a nonlocal version of the notion of viscosity solution with _ generalized boundary conditions _ , see  @xcite for an introduction of this notion in the context of second - order equations .",
    "additionally , fractional problems like   enjoy a _ regularizing effect _ as in the classical second - order case .",
    "roughly speaking , for a right - hand side which is merely bounded , the solution @xmath46 of   is locally hlder continuous in @xmath35 , see  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we should mention here that interior hlder regularity for more general fractional problems ( for which   is a particular case ) has been addressed by many authors , see for instance  @xcite and the classical book of landkof  @xcite , for a non - exhaustive list of references .",
    "the interior hlder regularity is accomplished by well established elliptic techniques as the harnack s inequality ( @xcite ) and the ishii - lions method ( @xcite ) . in both cases",
    ", the nonintegrability of the kernel plays a key role .",
    "hlder regularity for problems like   can be extended up to the boundary , as it is proved by ros - oton and serra in @xcite , where a boundary harnack s inequality is the key ingredient ( see also  @xcite ) . naturally , as a byproduct of these regularity results ,",
    "compactness properties are available for certain families of solutions of fractional equations .",
    "for instance , the family @xmath47 of functions solving @xmath48 satisfies compactness properties when @xmath49 is uniformly bounded in @xmath50 .    for zero order problems , regularizing effects as arising in fractional problems",
    "are no longer available ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the finiteness of the kernel of zero order operators turns into degenerate ellipticity for which ishii - lions method can not be applied .",
    "thus , `` regularity results '' for zero order problems like  - are circumscribed to the heritage of the modulus of continuity of the right - hand side @xmath51 to the solution @xmath7 as it can be seen in  @xcite .",
    "however , the modulus of continuity found in  @xcite depends strongly on the size of the @xmath22 norm of @xmath19 , which explodes as @xmath4 .",
    "a similar lack of stability as @xmath4 can be observed in the harnack - type inequality results for nonlocal problems found by coville in  @xcite . hence , none of the mentioned tools are adequate for getting compactness for the family of solutions @xmath52 of problem  - , which is a paradoxical situation since , in the limit case , the solutions actually get higher regularity and stronger compactness control on its behavior .    in view of the discussion given above",
    ", a natural mathematical question is if there exists a uniform modulus of continuity in @xmath35 , for the family of solutions @xmath53 to - , and consequently compactness properties for it . in this direction , the main result of this paper is the following    [ teo1 ] let @xmath0 a bounded domain with @xmath14 boundary and @xmath9 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "let @xmath7 be a solution to problem  - .",
    "then , there is a modulus of continuity @xmath54 depending only on @xmath51 , such that latexmath:[\\ ] ] it is known that the unique viscosity solution @xmath7 of   agrees the prescribed value of the equation on the boundary , and then @xmath471 on @xmath13 for all @xmath2 , see for example @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath58 is uniformly bounded in @xmath50 and therefore , the application of half - relaxed limits together with viscosity stability results in  @xcite , imply @xmath57 locally uniform in @xmath35 as @xmath4 , where @xmath56 is the unique solution to  . since @xmath56 is strictly positive in @xmath13 , the convergence of @xmath7 to @xmath56 can not be uniform in @xmath87 , and therefore the family @xmath58 is not equicontinuous in this case .",
    "this example resembles the behavior of the viscosity solutions @xmath7 of the equation @xmath472 which approximate the solution of the equation @xmath473 in this case , the family @xmath474 is not equicontinuous too , see  @xcite .",
