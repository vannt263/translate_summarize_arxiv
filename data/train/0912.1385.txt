    "the conventional @xmath208 flux is suppressed by about two orders of magnitude in this energy regime relative to prompt @xmath209 flux .",
    "when calculating the underground electron or positron fluxes from pair production , there should be rare events where one of the leptons comes out with a significant fraction of the initial muon energy . in a detector like icecube",
    ", it may be difficult to identify the accompanying lepton , as well as the muon after scattering .",
    "this type of event could fake a `` lollipop '' type signal when looking for tau neutrino induced tau events . a comparison of figs .",

    "muon bremstrahlung contributions are even larger , potentially adding to a faked signal .",
    "while muon production of tau pairs in the pev energy range is less than the prompt atmospheric @xmath189 contribution , at lower energies there is the potential for downward secondary @xmath189 production from conventional muons via @xmath211 in , for example , the tev to pev energy range . in this energy range , the taus decay promptly .",
    "our calculations have focused on large cherenkov detectors , but the same formalism could be applied for calculating underground lepton rates at the indian neutrino observatory ( ino ) . due to magnetization , ino will have the capability of separating the electron ( or @xmath212 ) signal from that of the positron ( or @xmath213 ) .",
    "this will allow observations at ino to determine the energy distribution of the charged partner when looking at pair production events , something that could be predicted numerically with our evaluation of the differential cross section .",
    "electromagnetic interactions , in particular lepton pair production by muons in transit through materials , are interesting in their own right , not just how they affect the energy loss of muons . as neutrino telescopes and air shower detectors focus on neutrino induced signals , muon signals with high energy electrons or taus may provide interesting cross checks to neutrino signals",
