    "<S> the standard analysis of the step height in current , which yields the well - known bessel - function dependence on an effective ac drive amplitude , is valid only when the drive frequency is large compared with the junction plasma frequency or the drive amplitude is large compared with the zero - voltage josephson current . using a first - order krylov - bogoliubov power - balance approach we derive an expression for the threshold value of the drive amplitude for zero - crossing steps that is not limited to the large frequency or large amplitude region . </S>",

    "<S> the phenomenon was recognized as being potentially important for voltage - standard applications inasmuch as the elimination of the dc bias current would eliminate one possible pathway for the entry of noise into the system . </S>",

    "<S> the ` standard ' analysis that emerged from these studies expressed the height in current of phase - locked shapiro steps in terms of bessel functions of an effective drive amplitude ; this analysis was shown to be appropriate when the frequency of the ac drive is large compared with the junction plasma frequency or when the amplitude of the ac drive is large compared with the zero - voltage josephson current . </S>",

    "<S> this fact suggests that , at least in some cases , the basin of attraction of the phase - locked state is rather small , perhaps indeed vanishing , a fact that would have important implications for the stability of the locked state , _ </S>",

    "<S> the technique of cell mapping @xcite might be a useful tool for exploring this question .    </S>",

    "<S> the approach , however , clearly becomes rather unwieldy if more than the first few terms in the fourier expansion are employed .    </S>",
    "<S> the power - balance approach can also be extended beyond the lowest level of approximation that we have employed here @xcite ; this would presumably permit a description of superharmonic steps , which presently is lacking from our analysis . however , superharmonic steps occur at progressively higher voltages , which implies progressively higher frequencies , where the simple bessel - function expression , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 15 ) , is known to give a reasonable description of the situation . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the reward to be obtained here might not be worth the effort .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we must offer one _ caveat _ : as is apparent from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a , the power - balance prediction becomes progressively better than the bessel - function prediction as the ac drive frequency is reduced below unity ( which is the plasma frequency , with our normalization ) . </S>",
