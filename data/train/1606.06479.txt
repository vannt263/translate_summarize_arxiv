    "exciton - polaritons in microcavities in the strong coupling regime have been studied intensively in recent years@xcite .",
    "they are realized by placing semiconductor quantum wells ( qws ) at the antinode position of a resonant electromagnetic field inside a cavity .",
    "notable advances include the observation of phenomena such as polariton bose - einstein condensation@xcite , superfluidity@xcite and the formation of quantum vortices@xcite .",
    "a number of applications were developed , such as electrically pumped room temperature polariton lasers@xcite and optical logic devices@xcite .",
    "spatially indirect excitons , formed from an electron and a hole separated into adjacent coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) by an external bias are also an attractive system for study@xcite .",
    "this is due to the possibility to control the exciton properties by varying the applied electric field@xcite .",
    "macroscopic charge separation causes indirect excitons to have a built - in static dipole moment .",
    "this enhances the exciton - exciton interaction strength leading to a luminescence blue shift@xcite .",
    "the blue shift provides a probe of the exciton density and was used to study exciton phase transitions@xcite .",
    "the static dipole moment also facilitates electrostatic@xcite and optical@xcite control of exciton transport and was exploited for the development of excitonic devices@xcite .",
    "recently , cqws were embedded in a planar bragg - mirror microcavity to create polaritons with a large dipole moment typical for indirect excitons@xcite .",
    "usually , an indirect exciton is only weakly coupled to light due to the reduced overlap of the electron and hole wave functions . however , when asymmetric cqws are used , the electric field can be chosen such that the indirect exciton , direct exciton and the cavity mode are brought into resonance , resulting in a strongly coupled three - level system .",
    "such hybrid quasiparticles , called _ dipolaritons _ , present a system with a greater flexibility of control and new possible applications compared to regular polaritons formed from direct excitons .",
    "proposed applications include superradiant thz emission@xcite , tunable single - photon emission@xcite and optical parametric oscillators@xcite .",
    "dipolaritons were also realized in wide single qws embedded in a dielectric waveguide@xcite . in that work ,",
    "excitons under bias acquire a static dipole moment because the large qw width permits substantial charge separation . at the same time , excitons remain strongly coupled to light due to the absence of a potential barrier separating electrons and holes , so that their wave functions can have a sufficient overlap .    applying a magnetic field offers an extra degree of control over excitonic systems as it modifies the properties of excitons and consequently , those of exciton - polaritons .",
    "experiments have demonstrated continuous tuning from the weak to strong coupling regime and control of the vacuum rabi splitting by varying magnetic field@xcite .",
    "a magnetic field can suppress the polariton relaxation bottleneck as it enhances the polariton - phonon scattering rates@xcite .",
    "magnetic field dependence of the polariton lasing threshold was also investigated@xcite . however , all these works focused on polaritons without a static dipole moment .",
    "_ magneto - dipolaritons _ present an intriguing new system which , to the best of our knowledge , was not yet studied .",
    "in addition to the possibility to fabricate structures with different optical resonances and different qw and barrier widths , the combination of both electric and magnetic fields as controllable parameters realizes a highly non - trivial system with a rich physics to explore .",
    "this opens an avenue for new theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "the subject of this paper is a rigorous calculation of exciton - polariton states in microcavity - embedded cqws and an examination of their dependence on electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we show that the magnetic field enhances the exciton - photon coupling and can effectively compensate for the darkening associated with the direct - indirect exciton crossover .",
    "this allows polaritons in the strongly coupled regime to have a large static dipole moment that is comparable to the center - to - center distance of the cqws .",
    "we use the multi - sub - level approach ( msla ) recently introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the main benefit of this approach is that we solve precisely the exciton schr \" odinger equation in three dimensions . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we used this method to calculate the electric and magnetic field dependence of the lifetime , bohr radius , dipole moment , binding energy and effective mass of cqw excitons .",
    "we found that these properties strongly depend on the direct - indirect exciton crossover which occurs for changing electric and/or magnetic field .",
    "such a dependence can not be captured by any two - dimensional ( 2d ) approximations of the exciton that were used by many authors , see e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "the same method was used to describe the effect of barrier width on the cqw excitons in an electric field@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the msla was extended to describe dipolaritons .",
    "however , this was done without including the influence of an applied magnetic field , which is the main focus of the present paper .    in section[modelsec ] , we describe our method of solving the coupled schr \" odinger and maxwell s wave equations used to model polaritons in microcavity - embedded cqws .",

    "bright direct excitons have an energy that changes slowly with @xmath55 . in contrast , dark indirect excitons quickly decrease in energy with increasing @xmath55 due to their large dipole moment which is oriented to screen the electric field .",

    "the diamagnetic shift of the exciton ground state is seen .",
    "also , the brightness increases with @xmath102 .",
    "this is due to the magnetic field shrinking the in - plane part of the exciton wave function  an effect arising from tightening of the electron and hole cyclotron orbits .",
    "the shrinkage increases the overlap of electron and hole wave functions and thus enhances the coupling to light .",

    "the displacement of the polariton states from the cavity mode ( shown by the blue dashed line ) indicates the strength of the polariton effect .",
    "exciton states with large oscillator strength or those that are close in energy to the cavity mode significantly modify the reflectivity .",
    "the results presented in fig.[spectrum ] can be summarized as follows .",
    "increasing electric field causes the direct - to - indirect crossover of the exciton ground state@xcite and impresses a dipole moment upon the exciton part of the polariton .",
    "however , it comes at the cost of reducing the exciton brightness and eventually leads to the successive disappearance of the lowest polariton branches .",
    "the magnetic field has the reverse effect and enhances the coupling strength .",
    "it can also induce an inverse , indirect - to - direct exciton crossover which diminishes the dipole moment@xcite .",
    "both electric and magnetic field provide a means to tune the exciton energy with respect to the cavity mode .",
    "we examine the field dependencies further in fig.[efd ] . for the lowest three polariton states which are labeled in figs.[spectrum]a and [ spectrum]b",
    ", we identify the polariton energy as the location of the minimum in the reflectivity spectrum .",
    "these energies are plotted in figs.[efd]a and [ efd]e . to extract the properties of each state we evaluate the microscopic polarization @xmath14 and define the polariton brightness @xmath103 and dipole moment @xmath104 , as in@xcite , by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a normalizing constant .",
    "note that the above quantities do not depend on @xmath107 due to the modulus of @xmath14 ( see the explicit form of @xmath14 in appendix  [ app0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath103 , shown in figs.[efd]b and [ efd]f , measures the contribution of the cavity photon and increases with the electron - hole overlap integral .",
    "@xmath104 , shown in figs.[efd]c and [ efd]g , is the sum of the dipole moments of all exciton states included in the summation in eq.([chinm ] ) , each weighted by their contribution to the total polariton wave function .",
    "the left ( right ) panels in fig.[efd ] correspond to the upper ( lower ) panel in fig.[spectrum ] .     with @xmath108 ( a - d ) and as a function of @xmath102 with @xmath109 ( e - h ) . the states in ( a - d ) and ( e - h ) correspond to those labeled in fig.[spectrum]a and [ spectrum]b , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines in ( c ) and ( g ) are the maximum nominal dipole moment@xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    fig.[efd ] shows that the model predicts the existence of dipolaritons characterized by a static dipole length that can be comparable to the nominal center - to - center distance of the cqws .",
    "moreover , fields @xmath55 and @xmath102 provide a way to tune the dipole moments . oscillations of the brightness ( fig.[efd]b and [ efd]f ) and dipole moment ( fig.[efd]c and [ efd]g ) are seen when changing either electric or magnetic field .",
    "such dependence can be explained in terms of the anti - crossings between different polariton branches .",
    "similar to indirect excitons , the electric field causes an energy shift of dipolaritons that depends linearly on the dipole moment ( approximately @xmath110 ) .",
    "conversely , the dipole moment is approximately proportional to the energy gradient @xmath111 ( here @xmath112 is the exciton energy ) .",
    "the intricate anticrossings between polariton branches , which originate from anticrossings between the different direct and indirect exciton states , causes variations in this gradient ( see figs.[spectrum]a and [ efd]a ) .",
    "oscillations in the dipole moment are therefore ascribed to @xmath113 oscillating in @xmath55 and @xmath102 . in comparing fig.[efd]b and [ efd]c ( or [ efd]f and [ efd]g )",
    ", we see that any increase in the dipole length is accompanied by a decrease in brightness .",
    "this happens as the exciton part of the polariton transforms from a bright direct to a dark indirect state .    in figs.[efd]d and [ efd]h",
    ", we show the electric and magnetic field dependence of the polariton effective mass , @xmath114 .",
    "this was determined by fitting a parabola to the polariton dispersion around @xmath115 as illustrated in fig.[schematic]c .",
    "the dependence of @xmath114 on @xmath55 and @xmath102 can be understood using a simple coupled oscillator model .",
    "the dispersion and , in turn , the mass of the polariton is approximated by diagonalizing a @xmath73 hamiltonian whose diagonal elements are the dispersionless exciton and the parabolic dispersion of the cavity photon .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are a coupling constant . in this approach",
    ", one finds that @xmath114 decreases sharply with increasing coupling and that the dependence on the coupling constant is much greater when the exciton energy is below the cavity mode .",
    "this accounts for some of the main features of the lower polariton effective mass seen in figs.[efd]d and [ efd]h . indeed , comparing with figs.[efd]b and [ efd]f",
    ", we see that an increase in brightness , which corresponds to an increase in coupling strength , sharply decreases @xmath114 .",
    "the combination of fields allows to tune the polariton mass over two orders of magnitude .",
    "figs.[efd]f , [ efd]g and [ efd]h show that in the limit of high electric and magnetic fields ( @xmath109 and @xmath116 ) the polariton ground state acquires a substantial dipole moment ( @xmath117 ) whilst remaining comparably bright and has an effective mass less than @xmath118 .",
    "this particular realization of magneto - dipolaritons , whose dispersion is shown in fig.[schematic]c , offers favorable conditions for low condensation threshold and strong polariton - polariton interactions that can be used to probe many - body interactions .",
    "we now explore the properties of magneto - dipolaritons in a fixed energy scheme . @xmath55 and @xmath102 are increased simultaneously so that the diamagnetic shift of the exciton ground state is compensated for by the electric field .",
    "this is approximately achieved with an electric field that is linear in @xmath102 , going from @xmath119 at @xmath120 up to @xmath121 at @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting energy of the exciton ground state is shown by red circles in fig.[fixedenergy]a and is practically constant .",
    "we then used cavity modes with different detunings @xmath122 from the exciton ground state .",
    "the grayscale in fig.[fixedenergy]a shows the reflectivity spectrum for the case of @xmath123 and the cavity mode is shown by the blue dashed line .",
    "increasing the electric field reduces the spatial overlap of electron and hole wave functions and darkens the polariton state . in the fixed energy scheme",
    ", this is compensated for by the magnetic field which shrinks the radius of the exciton wave function in the qw plane .",
    "the brightness of the polariton ground state is shown in fig.[fixedenergy]b .",
    "we see only a weak dependence on the fields .",
    "in contrast , the dipole moment of the polariton ground state , shown in fig.[fixedenergy]c increases substantially due to the increasing electric field .",
    "for example , with @xmath123 the dipole moment is increased three fold at the rather minor sacrifice of about a @xmath124 decrease in brightness .",
    "the magnetic field can therefore be used to create polaritons that are both bright and have a large static dipole moment .",
    "we implemented a precise calculation of exciton - polariton states in microcavity embedded cqws in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to the qw plane .",
    "we evaluated the energy , brightness , dipole moment and effective mass of the lowest three polariton states .",
    "we found a trade - off between the brightness and dipole moment as increasing the latter reduces the exciton oscillator strength which in turn depends on the electron - hole overlap .",
    "however , the reduction of the polariton brightness caused by an electric field - induced dipole moment can be compensated by a magnetic field which shrinks the exciton wave function in the qw plane . as as result",
    ", a polariton with a substantial dipole moment can be formed in the strong coupling regime , also showing a significantly reduced ( down to @xmath125 ) polariton effective mass .",

    "<S> our model predicts the existence of polaritons which are in the strong coupling regime and at the same time possess a large static dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , in particular , that a magnetic field can compensate for the reduction in light - matter coupling that occurs when an electric field impresses a dipole moment on the polariton . </S>"
