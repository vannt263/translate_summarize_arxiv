    "atomic samples for which external perturbations and mutual interactions between the atoms are completely symmetric under permutations of the atoms are conveniently described in terms of collective variables . in particular , if the atoms have two internal states relevant for the dynamical processes , each atom can be represented as a spin @xmath1 particle , and the full hamiltonian of the system can be expressed in terms of the collective spin operator @xmath2 .",
    "a state vector of the system which reflects the permutation symmetry of @xmath3 two - level particles can be expanded on the set of symmetric dicke states @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , and the quantum number @xmath6 ranges from @xmath7 , where all the atoms populate the states associated with a spin down single particle state , to @xmath8 where all are in the spin up state .",
    "intermediate values represent states containing all possible permutations of the atoms populating either of the two spin @xmath1 components , but with a definite total number , @xmath9 , of atoms in the spin up ( @xmath10 ) and down states ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "collective behavior of atomic ensembles is at the root of superradiance , and the dicke states were introduced to account for atom - field interactions already many years ago .",
    "the past decade has provided numerous discussions and analyses of collective atomic dynamics in connection with atomic clocks and quantum information @xcite , and recently a number of promising schemes has been presented for tailoring of the collective atomic spin noise , relying on atom - light interaction @xcite , collisional interactions in atomic samples @xcite , and on quantum non - demolition measurements @xcite .",
    "restricting calculations to the space spanned by the symmetric dicke states implies a formidable simplification of the full @xmath12 dimensional problem to an @xmath13 dimensional one , and use of algebraic properties of the angular momentum operators further facilitate calculations of properties of the physical system .",
    "a large number of theoretical analyses therefore presents calculations restricted to this subspace .",
    "but , even if the assumption holds that the systems is invariant under exchange of atoms , not only the symmetric dicke states will be populated : imagine two two - level atoms , both described by the mixed state density matrix @xmath14 the combined state @xmath15 of both atoms is also a mixed state .",
    "it is manifestly symmetric under exchange of the atoms , but if @xmath16 or @xmath17 it is a mixture of all @xmath18 product states spanning the full hilbert space of the pair of particles , and by a basis change we see that both the spin singlet and the three spin triplet eigenstates of the collective spin operator are populated . unlike the spin singlet wave function ,",
    "a density matrix component proportional to a projector on the spin singlet state is , indeed , invariant under exchange of the particles .",

    "clearly @xmath58 , hence we may begin with @xmath59 for which only a single state exists , and for which @xmath20 must equal @xmath8 . the combinatorial factor @xmath60 equals @xmath3 ( a single spin down particle can be chosen in @xmath3 different ways ) , and since only one of the states with @xmath61 can be obtained by the collective lowering operator @xmath62 acting on the state @xmath63 , the remaining @xmath64 states must have @xmath65 . applying",

    "the remaining @xmath67 must therefore have @xmath68 . continuing this argument",
    "provides the total number of states with @xmath69 for any @xmath70 , and by symmetry we obtain the same number of @xmath20-states for negative @xmath6 . in conclusion ,",

    "first , the marginal @xmath20-distribution , @xmath89 , is found to be @xmath90 for @xmath41 , @xmath91 according to .",
    "for convenience we shall assume @xmath92 in the remainder of this section , and consequently it seems justifiable to approximate by dropping the term @xmath93 in the numerator , thus obtaining @xmath94 we observe that the rightmost three terms constitute a normalized binomial distribution with an expectation value for @xmath20 of @xmath95 and a variance of @xmath96 . to justify the approximation made above in a more rigorous way",
    ", we may note that the omitted term corresponds to a similar binomial distribution centered at @xmath97 . the approximation is thus expected to be valid as long as @xmath98 , or equivalently @xmath99 .    the front - factor in the approximation is slowly varying for @xmath20 not too close to @xmath100 and it is close to unity at @xmath101 , which suggests that we may describe the marginal @xmath20 distribution by the binomial distribution alone . that this is indeed a good picture is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , where we also note that the limit of validity deducted above for the approximation seems to be correct , as the only peak where the approximation deviates visibly from the exact value corresponds to @xmath102 chosen at the validity limit .",
    "the variance in @xmath20 may be approximated by the variance of the binomial distribution , @xmath103 , which according to is equal to @xmath104 . since @xmath103 decreases with increasing @xmath19",
    ", we see that the @xmath20 states close to the maximal value of @xmath8 are only populated at very high polarizations , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "in particular the total population of the symmetric dicke states ( @xmath66 ) is given by @xmath105 according to .",

    "it is interesting to study the effect of spin squeezing operations on such states , since they might serve as models of imperfectly prepared initial states on which squeezing operations are performed .",
    "note that obtaining a spin squeezed state indicates that the initially uncorrelated atoms described by have become entangled @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing may be performed in a number of ways , and we will discuss the two unitary squeezing methods analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of initially pure distributions .",
    "both of these approaches make use of a hamiltonian which is quadratic in collective spin variables , _",
    "i.e. _ , it involves interactions among the particles .",
    "the description of the evolution of the states would be immensely complicated in the product state representation of the many spins where , in fact , very entangled states are produced . in the collective spin representation , however , the action only has to be computed for each total spin component , which is a much easier task .",
    "a one - axis twist about the @xmath29-axis , as mediated by the hamiltonian @xmath122 , will squeeze the variances of the @xmath123 and @xmath124 spin components of an initially maximally polarized state as illustrated on fig .",

    "assuming that @xmath19 is so close to unity that we may use @xmath135 and @xmath136 from section [ sec : dens - matr - tens-1 ] to estimate the center and width of the @xmath20-distribution , the relative variation of the optimal @xmath137 over the width of the @xmath20-distribution is approximately @xmath138 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath139 it is possible to choose a value of @xmath137 that is nearly optimal for all populated @xmath20 subspaces . according to and",
    ", we find that within each @xmath20-subspace , the fraction of the population in the uppermost @xmath6 level , @xmath140 , is larger than @xmath141 .",

    "when we perform the sum over all @xmath20-values we obtain the result illustrated by the solid ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the state is significantly squeezed , but less than in the ideal case indicated by the dotted ellipse . as anticipated , the population of the states with non - maximal @xmath6 within each subspace does not appear to have serious adverse effect on the squeezing process .",

    "the squared length of the minor and major axes of the ellipse drawn with a solid line equal the variance of the spin - component in these directions .",
    "additionally the direction of the minor axis correspond to the direction of minimal variance .",
    "the dotted ellipse shows , for comparison , the result of applying an optimal squeezing to an initially pure system ( @xmath38 ) , and the dashed ellipses illustrate the contributions from the various @xmath20 subspaces in the mixed case as discussed in the text . ]",
    "we analyze the time evolution under the two - axis countertwisting hamiltonian , @xmath144 .",
    "one advantage of the two - axis countertwisting hamiltonian is that the squeezing is always in the same direction .",
    "a disadvantage is that it can not be solved analytically , and we will proceed according to the holstein - primakov approximation which is only valid for highly polarized samples and not too strong squeezing . consequently we shall restrict the validity of our results to lowest order in @xmath145 and assume @xmath8 to be much larger than unity . using results from @xcite we find the variance of the squeezed component , @xmath124 , of @xmath146 after squeezing to be @xmath147 where @xmath148 . in the fully polarized limit ( @xmath38 ) we have @xmath149 , and",

    "extensively and introduced @xmath154 as @xmath155 .",
    "the three last terms of the second line are recognized as a normalized , rather narrow , binomial distribution . approximating this distribution with a @xmath156-function centered at @xmath157 we find @xmath158 to first order in @xmath159",
    "this is equal to @xmath160    based on this result we may determine the effect of the non - purity of the initial distribution on @xmath161 : the ratio between the frequency uncertainties obtainable by ramsey spectroscopy on squeezed and unsqueezed samples , as introduced by wineland _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "according to this reference we have @xmath162 where the terms in the denominator refer to the unsqueezed sample .",
    "since @xmath163 is independent of @xmath19 , and @xmath164 to first order in @xmath50 , we find that to lowest order in @xmath159 and @xmath50 we have @xmath165 that is : to first order in @xmath145 we get a correction to the quality of the squeezed ensemble as compared to the case of performing the same squeezing operation on an initially perfectly polarized ensemble .",
    "note that we have only examined how imperfect initial state preparation affects the ramsey spectroscopy ; for an analysis of the significance of decoherence during the measurement see refs .",
    "one of the virtues of the combinatorial analysis of collective spin distributions is that it may be generalized to the case where the atoms have spin @xmath22 .      proceeding as in section [ sec : coll - spin - stat ]",
    "we find that the dimension of the @xmath166 subspace is @xmath167 where the generalized binomial @xmath168 denotes the number of ways of placing @xmath6 indistinguishable balls in @xmath3 distinguishable urns so that no urn contains more than @xmath169 balls .",
    "note that this definition agrees with that of the ordinary binomial for @xmath170 .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that the generalized binomials are not as analytically accessible as the binomials .",
    "their numerical values may , however , easily be obtained through the recursion relation @xmath171 and their analytical properties are to some extent accessible from the generating function : @xmath172      in order to represent the tensor product @xmath173 in the basis of eigenstates of the collective angular momentum , we have to develop this basis and to identify the matrix elements of @xmath174 .",
    "it turns out to be advantageous to perform these two tasks in parallel by sequential coupling of angular momenta of 1 , 2 ,  , @xmath169 spin @xmath0 particles , and determination of the appropriate density matrices @xmath175 .",
    "let us introduce the collective spin of the first @xmath169 particles as @xmath176 we denote by @xmath177 the simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath178 and @xmath179 with eigenvalues @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively .",
    "these states are obtained by sequential coupling of the atomic spins : by coupling the first , @xmath182 , and second atom we obtain a total spin @xmath183 , which is subsequently coupled with the third atom to the resulting spin @xmath184 , etc .",
    "the density matrix @xmath74 is our known input .",
    "we assume that @xmath185 labels the basis vectors in which @xmath74 is diagonal with eigenvalues @xmath186 ( note that @xmath185 does not need to be associated with any real angular momentum or spin of the physical system , the spin representation is convenient to represent any @xmath187-level atomic system ) .",
    "if we assume that the density matrix , @xmath188 , of @xmath169 atoms is known in the basis of angular momentum coupled states , @xmath177 , we can recursively construct the density matrix of @xmath189 atoms : @xmath190 where we have utilized that @xmath188 is diagonal in @xmath181 as argued in section [ sec : dens - matr - tens-1 ] , and we have introduced @xmath191 as a shorthand for the intermediate angular momenta @xmath192 .",
