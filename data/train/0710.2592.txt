    "interacting uniform electronic systems@xcite and non - interacting disordered electronic systems@xcite are two of the most intriguing , albeit difficult , subjects in condensed matter physics . as a result of the complexity of the simultaneous presence of randomness and interactions , few definitive results are known.@xcite to understand the effects of electrons interaction on the localization properties in a random potential , shepelyansky proposed some years earlier that it would be worthwhile to consider the simple case of two interacting particles(tip ) in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) random potential.@xcite subsequently , extensive efforts have been devoted to tip in various systems.@xcite in particular , two interacting electrons with total spin zero in a 1d harper model,@xcite in fibonacci and thue - morse lattices @xcite are studied .",
    "the behavior of tip has been studied using the time evolution of wave packets , @xcite exact diagonalization , @xcite green function @xcite and transfer - matrix,@xcite @xmath3 . due to different definitions of the localization length for tip and different methods applied ,",
    "there are discrepancies about the effect of the combination of disorder and interaction . for example , for tip in 1d disordered potentials , shepelyansky @xcite and others @xcite",
    "have found that for small interaction strengths , the two - particle interaction can enhance the anderson localization length , while rmer and schreiber @xcite found no enhancement of the localization length when the system size grows to infinity .",
    "evangelou @xmath4 @xmath5 have pointed out that stronger localization occurs at large interaction when compared to the noninteracting case.@xcite at the same time , for tip in a 1d harper model , it was found that the interaction would induce localization effect,@xcite while evangelou and katsanos @xcite found that the effects of particle interactions are different for electrons in extended and localized regimes .    on the other hand , quantum entanglement , which attracting much attention in quantum information,@xcite has been extensively applied in condensed matter physics.@xcite for examples , quantum entanglement measured by the von neumann entropy was studied in the hubbard model for the dimer case @xcite , in the extended hubbard model for different band filling@xcite , in quantum small - world networks@xcite , and in low - dimensional semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "it was found that the von neumann entropy is suitable for analyzing the interplay between itinerant and localized features @xcite , as well as characterizing quantum phase transition@xcite and the localization - delocalization transition of electron states@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a detailed study of the von neumann entropy for tip in 1d disordered and quasiperiodic systems respectively , taking into account different on - site interactions @xmath1 at various on - site potential strengths .",
    "we find that for tip in disordered and slowly varying potential systems , the spectrum - averaged von neunmann entropy @xmath2 first increases with interaction @xmath1 until its peaks , then decreases as @xmath1 gets larger .",
    "for tip in the 1d harper model , the functions of @xmath2 versus @xmath1 are different for particles in extended and localized regimes .",
    "finally we study a two - particle system based on the slowly varying potential model .@xcite from these studies , we can conclude that for tip systems , the von neumann entropy is a suitable quantity to characterize the localization properties of particle states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "following recent literature@xcite the eigenvalue equation for the tip in 1d system can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the on - site potential , @xmath8 is a nearest - neighbor hopping integral and @xmath1 characterizes the on - site interaction between particles .",

    "the hilbert space can be conveniently divided into a singlet subspace with total spin @xmath19 and a triplet subspace with total spin @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "<S> we find that for tip in disordered and slowly varying potential systems , the spectrum - averaged von neunmann entropy @xmath0 first increases with interaction @xmath1 until its peaks , then decreases as @xmath1 gets larger . </S>",
    "<S> for tip in the harper model , the functions of @xmath2 versus @xmath1 are different for particles in extended and localized regimes . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results indicate that for these two - particle systems , the von neumann entropy is a suitable quantity to characterize the localization properties of particle states . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our studies propose a consistent interpretation of the discrepancies between previous numerical results . </S>"
