    "many combinatorial optimization problems can be viewed as optimization problems over independence systems . some of them are polynomially solvable , e.g. , spanning trees in graphs , the branching problem in digraphs , or the matching problem .",

    "@xcite ) . among the problems with a polynomial - time algorithm ,",
    "the matching problem is generally recognized as one of the `` hardest '' , and the famous blossom algorithm by edmonds  @xcite is one of the highlights of combinatorial optimization .",
    "another seminal result on the optimization in independence systems was also given by edmonds @xcite , who proved that the optimization problem over the intersection of two matroids is solvable in polynomial time .",
    "algorithms for this problem were given by edmonds @xcite , frank @xcite , and lawler @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this can not be generalized to the case of three or more matroids : as the np - complete tsp can be written as an optimization problem over the intersection of three matroids , it is highly unlikely that a polynomial - time algorithm exists .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a problem that combines aspects of both problems that were solved by edmonds : how many matroids need to be intersected to characterize the matchings of a graph ?",
    "this problem is somewhat related to work by jenkyns  @xcite and korte and hausmann  @xcite , who described approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithm ; these guarantees depend on the rank quotient , which depends on the number of matroids needed for characterizing the independence system .",
    "clearly , we are not primarily interested in these approximation guarantees for matching .",
    "however , we believe that the problem of describing an independence system as the intersection of few matroids is an interesting combinatorial problem in its own right .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after some technical preliminaries in section  [ preliminaries ] , section  [ main ] gives a number of general structural results .",
    "in particular , we give a precise characterizations of graphs for which the set of matchings can be represented as the intersection of two matroids , and an integer programming formulation for the problem of minimizing the number of matroids that are necessary for representing the matchings of an input graph . in section  [ sec : lower ] we prove that @xmath10 needs at least @xmath11 matroids , while section  [ sec : upper ] establishes an upper bound of @xmath12 for the number of matroids needed for any graph with @xmath3 vertices .",
