    "twitter is an extremely popular social networking tool for communicating through short messages called tweets . as of july 2014",
    ", twitter has 255 million monthly active users and 500 million daily tweets . due to such massive user bases and popular usage ,",
    "twitter has been increasingly used in social communications , information campaigns , public relations , political campaigns , pandemic and crisis situations , marketing , and many other public / private contexts .",
    "user privacy is arguably a major concern about twitter .",
    "specifically , user profiles and tweets may contain sensitive information about life , work , health , hobbies , political opinions , etc .",
    "twitter currently offers little protection for user profiles and tweets which are virtually visible to anyone with or without an account .",
    "consequently , many users employ pseudonyms instead of real names in their profiles . in addition",
    ", twitter users often hide their home locations ( location for short thereafter ) , which are _ permanent and static city - level _ regions ( e.g. , philadelphia ) where most of their daily activities occur .",
    "specifically , they may either not indicate their locations or report very general locations ( e.g. , state - level ) in their profiles ; they may not indicate their locations in their tweets either .",
    "for example , less than 34% of twitter users explicitly specify their locations in their profiles @xcite , only 16% of twitter users indicate city - level locations , and only 0.5% of tweets have a geo - tag @xcite .    there have been some efforts to infer a twitter user s hidden location .",
    "content - based methods @xcite try to infer hidden locations based on geographic hints such as city landmarks in tweets .",
    "for example , a user who frequently mentions `` golden bridge '' in his tweets may indicate his location in the bay area .",
    "in contrast , network - based methods @xcite leverage the fact that geographically - close people tend to form a connection or community in online social networks ( osns ) @xcite , so a user s location can be inferred from those of his online neighbors ( or neighbors neighbors , etc ) . based on different estimation techniques , all these efforts @xcite seek to address the same question : how can we infer a twitter user s hidden location from all his location - related tweets and/or osn neighbors locations ?",
    "this paper targets a different and more challenging problem : is it feasible to efficiently discover the majority of twitter users in any city - level metropolitan area ( @xmath0 ) without collaborating with twitter ?",
    "since only 16% of twitter users register city - level locations@xcite , it is infeasible to tackle our problem by directly checking users tweets and profiles .",
    "in addition , directly applying any prior solution @xcite would inevitably involve checking every ( 255 million ) twitter user s tweets , followers , and/or followees , thus leading to a prohibitive cost .",
    "an affirmative answer to our target problem above would have significant _ positive _ and _ negative _ impacts . on the _ positive _ side ,",
    "finding the majority of the users in a specific area can not only benefit many applications such as local event detection and recommendation , business marketing , and em- ergency - alert dissemination , but also offer a feasible way to sample twitter to facilitate the research concerning geographically related information .",
    "on the _ negative _ side , if an attacker can infer the majority of the twitter users in a specific area , he could easily combine the location information with user tweets to better profile twitter users who may or may not use pseudonyms , thus breaching their privacy and subjecting them to many identity - based attacks .",
    "moreover , the twitter users with exposed locations are vulnerable to large - scale location - based or geo - targeted spam campaigns @xcite .    in this paper , we propose locinfer , a novel and lightweight solution to the above problem for the first time in literature .",
    "the design of locinfer is driven by two conjectures .",
    "first , a small but nontrivial fraction of users ( 15.9% on average in our datasets ) have specified a credible location in the target area @xmath0 in their personal profiles , each of which is referred to as a _ seed user _ hereafter .",
    "second , user communications in twitter exhibit strong geographic locality in the sense that the users in the same area tend to interact more often than with those from outside .",
    "we confirm these two conjectures through large - scale datasets involving four representative metropolitan areas in u.s .",
    "built upon these conjectures , locinfer",
    "iteratively checks the immediate neighbors of the seed set , and the users who have tight connections with the seed set become new seeds and are added to the seed set .",
    "the final seed set contains the majority of twitter users in @xmath0 with overwhelming probability .",
    "locinfer is highly efficient because only a small number of candidate users need to be checked in contrast to almost all the twitter users when the existing methods @xcite are applied to our problem .",
    "our contributions can be summarized as follows .    * we motivate and formulate the problem of large - scale location inference , which is challenging given that only a small fraction of twitter users have specified a credible city - level location in their personal profiles .",
    "* we design locinfer , a novel and lightweight solution that can uncover the majority of the twitter users in a specific metropolitan area . *",
    "we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate locinfer using four large - scale datasets .",
    "our results show that locinfer can successfully discover on average 86.6% of the users with 73.2% accuracy .",
    "* we propose a countermeasure against locinfer for the twitter users worrying about their location privacy and evaluate its effectiveness via simluations .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : dla ] defines the problem .",
    "section  [ sec : validation ] validates our two conjectures through four large - scale datasets .",
    "section  [ sec : locinfer ] details the locinfer design .",
    "section  [ sec : evaluate ] evaluates locinfer and our countermeasure .",
    "section  [ sec : rw ] surveys the related work .",
    "section  [ sec : cfw ] concludes this paper and presents some future work .",
    "we use a directed and weighted multigraph to model the diverse communications between twitter users . in twitter , people can follow others without mutual consent ; they can mention others in their own tweets ; they can also reply to or retweet others tweets .",
    "we classify these communications into two categories : _ following _ and _ interacting _ ( retweeting , replying , and mentioning ) , denoted by symbols @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "such diverse communications are modeled as a directed and weighted multigraph @xmath3 , where each vertex @xmath4 represents a user .",
    "we refer to a directed edge for the following type as a following edge and a directed edge for the interacting type as an interacting edge . a following edge @xmath5 is formed when user @xmath6 followed @xmath7 ; we call user @xmath6 a _ follower _ of @xmath7 and @xmath7 a _ followee _ of @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , an interacting edge @xmath8 is formed when user @xmath6 mentioned , replied to , or retweeted @xmath7 at least once ; we call user @xmath6 a _ responder _ of @xmath7 and @xmath7 an _ initiator _ of @xmath6 .",
    "to model the interaction strength , we define @xmath9 , the weight of edge @xmath10 , as the total number of retweets , replies , and mentions from user @xmath6 to @xmath7 . for consistency , we also define the weight of any following edge as one .",
    "we use @xmath11 to represent @xmath12 s one - hop followers , followees , responders , and initiators , respectively .",
    "we also define the one - hop neighbors of @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "+ * large - scale location inference . * given a twitter multigraph @xmath3 and a target metropolitan area @xmath0 , we aim to obtain a target user list @xmath14 which contains the majority of twitter users in @xmath0 without collaborating with twitter . +",
    "* design goals .",
    "* locinfer is designed with the following goals .",
    "* _ high coverage_. the target user list @xmath14 should cover the majority of twitter users in @xmath0 . if we denote the actual twitter users in @xmath0 by @xmath15 , the coverage can be computed as @xmath16 .",
    "* _ high accuracy_. the target users in @xmath14 should be indeed located in @xmath0 .",
    "the accuracy can be computed as @xmath17 . *",
    "_ efficiency_. locinfer should only involve checking twitter users proportional in quantity to the population in @xmath0 in contrast to existing methods @xcite which all need to check all the twitter users .",
    "this efficiency requirement is particularly important because without twitter s collaboration , the only free way to obtain the users information is via third - party apis , which is time - consum- ing as twitter has strict rate limits on apis invoking @xcite .",
    "for example , an authenticated user can only invoke the get - followers api 15 times per 15 minutes .",
    "hence if we invoke this api once for each of the 255 million twitter users , it will spend a single authenticated user about 485 years to obtain all the twitter users followers .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tlb : evaluation ]          we first evaluate the accuracy of locinfer .",
    "we compute five locality values for each user , including follower locality , followee locality , initiator locality , and the two locality values defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seploc ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : comloc ] ) , respectively .    fig .",
    "[ fig : acc ] shows the accuracy of locinfer for the four datasets , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we can see that the five locality metrics all lead to high accuracy in each area , and initiator locality has the worst performance among them . specifically , the average accuracy of four datasets for each locality are 73.2% , 72.6% , 62.3% , 72.4% , 71.9% , respectively .",
    "the reason is that initiator locality depends on interacting edges ( corresponding to replies , mentions , and retweets ) which are much sparser than following edges in the directed twitter multigraph as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgd ] . therefore , if many users in @xmath0 only follow many people but do not interact with them subsequently , they may be reachable from seed users through following edges but not from interacting edges",
    ". we will show the coverage for different locality metrics in the following section  [ sec : coverage ] .",
    "moreover , the locality defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : seploc ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : comloc ] ) have nearly the same accuracy with both the follower and followee locality .",
    "this is expected because about 96.2% of the seed set s initiator neighbors are from their followers or followees , as indicated in section  [ sec : validation ] . to shed more light on the accuracy of locinfer , we set @xmath20 so that @xmath21 when alg .",
    "2 terminates , i.e. , every candidate user is eventually added into @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the newly discovered users ( may not in @xmath0 ) , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "we partition @xmath23 into 100 bins of equal size @xmath25 according to the order they are added , where the bins of smaller indexes contain the users discovered earlier .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the number of positive ground - truth users in the @xmath6-th bin .",
    "[ fig : accu - bin ] shows the accuracy of the @xmath6-th bin , which is defined as the ratio of the number of positive ground - truth users in the @xmath6-th bin and the number of users in each bin and is computed as @xmath27 .",
    "we can see that the accuracy in each bin decreases as the bin index increases , which is expected , as the later the users are added to @xmath23 , the less likely they are indeed located in @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : impact - alpha ] shows the impact of @xmath28 on the accuracy of locinfer .",
    "as expected , the accuracy under all locality metrics increases as @xmath29 increases .",
    "the reason is that the larger the @xmath29 , the more seeds , and the easier the target users in @xmath0 can be discovered .",
    "the downside is that more seeds lead to a larger candidate set and thus higher crawling and computational cost , as alg .",
    "[ alg : step1 ] needs to check all the neighbors of the seeds .",
    "[ fig : impact - t ] shows the impact of @xmath30 on the accuracy by varying @xmath30 from one to six .",
    "specifically , fig .",
    "[ fig : t - loc ] shows the accuracy for four areas using the followee locality , while fig .",
    "[ fig : t - type ] shows the accuracy for different locality metrics by using the ` pi ` dataset .",
    "both figures show the accuracy decreases as @xmath30 increases .",
    "this is expected because increasing @xmath30 will result in the decrease in the size of candidate set and hence miss more users in the target user list who have no chance to appear in the candidate set . however , there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and cost because smaller candidate set will also bring the lower crawling and computational cost .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] shows the coverage of locinfer when @xmath31 with the desired number of target users ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , varying from zero to the whole candidate set size @xmath33 .",
    "we use both the followee and follower locality in this experiment .",
    "as expected , the larger @xmath34 , the more users in @xmath35 contained in @xmath14 , the higher coverage , and vice versa .",
    "when we set @xmath36 , the average coverage of these four locations by using followee , follower , and initiator locality is equal to 86.3% , 86.6% , and 79.7% , respectively . as stated , since the interacting edges ( corresponding to replies , mentions , and retweets ) are much sparser than following edges in the directed twitter multigraph as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avgd ] , the initiator locality has less coverage than the followee and follower locality .",
    "moreover , the average coverage by using the follower or followee locality in fig .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] is consistent with corollary  [ co : coverage1 ] . specifically , the average number of mutual followers @xmath37 for four datasets is 7.8 , 9.0 , 11.6 , and 11.6 , respectively .",
    "according to corollary  [ co : coverage1 ] , when @xmath31 , @xmath38 which coincides with our results .",
    "[ fig : tradeoff ] also shows the anticipated tradeoff between the coverage and accuracy . as we can see , the larger @xmath39 , the more the positive ground - truth users will be added to @xmath14 , resulting in higher coverage .",
    "however , a larger @xmath39 will also introduce negative ground - truth users into @xmath14 , resulting in lower accuracy .",
    "this tradeoff could guide us to choose the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "on the one hand , if one desires higher coverage , a large termination threshold @xmath40 should be used , but it is possible that many users in @xmath14 may be not indeed in @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one wants to be certain that the users discovered by locinfer are most likely in @xmath0 , a smaller @xmath40 should be used at the cost of possibly missing some users indeed in @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : cm ]      to evaluate the efficacy of this countermeasure , we let each user in the testing set @xmath35 in each area additionally follow or be followed by a certain number of users from @xmath41 who are not in @xmath0 , and we refer to those following edges as _ camouflage _ edges .",
    "[ fig : cm ] shows the accuracy result under this countermeasure . as we can see",
    ", the accuracy of locinfer decreases as the number of camouflage edges increases , highlighting the efficacy of the countermeasure . besides adding random following edges ,",
    "a user can also retweet , mention , and reply to random users on a regular basis to counteract locinfer , which is expected to yield the similar results as these interactions can also decrease the geographic locality .",
    "in this section , we briefly present the existing work mostly related to this paper .    inferring a twitter user",
    "s hidden location has been widely studied in the community , which can be categorized as cont- ented - based and network - based methods .",
    "content - based methods @xcite try to infer the user s location by his tweets .",
    "for example , cheng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a probabilistic framework to estimate a twitter user s location based on his tweets , resulting in placing 51% of twitter users within 100 miles of their home locations .",
    "@xcite further improved this result to 64% for city - level location inference .",
    "@xcite thoroughly studied the location profiles for the twitter users and found that 34% of the users either left them empty or just non - geographic information .",
    "they also inferred the user s country and state information by checking their tweets .",
    "network - based methods try to estimate a twitter user s locations by his neighbors @xcite .",
    "jurgens @xcite aimed to infer all the users location by building a global networks and then propagating location assignments from several seeds .",
    "@xcite built several distributed landmarks and then inferred a user s location based on the connections with them .",
    "@xcite inferred the locations of all the users in twitter by minimizing their distances with the labelled users .",
    "moreover , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite combined the content and network information to obtain the more accurate estimation .",
    "all these schemes seek to address the same question : how can we infer a user s hidden location from all his location - related tweets and/or neighbors locations ?",
    "this paper targets a different problem : could we discover all or the majority of twitter users in a metropolitan area ? directly adopting these existing methods to address our problem will result in scanning the whole twitter network .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of locinfer outperforms the state of the art in @xcite .",
    "this paper is also related to privacy disclosure and protection in osns in general .",
    "li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the neighbors locations to infer the location in the emerging location - based social networks .",
    "@xcite protected the location privacy on the social crowdsourcing networks .",
    "@xcite used the tweets to detect the twitter users situational leak such as vacation status , drunk status , and medical conditions .",
    "@xcite leveraged the information from neighbors to estimate the age of facebook users .",
    "@xcite also used the local connections around the facebook users to infer their hidden attributes such as major , college , and political view .",
    "our paper is complementary to these work and also highlights that current osns have emerged as an arguable threat to users privacy .",
    "this paper presented locinfer , a novel system that is able to discover the majority of twitter users in any geographic area .",
    "detailed experiments confirmed the high efficacy and efficiency of locinfer .",
    "we also proposed a countermeasure to hide the locations of sensitive users from locinfer and evaluated its efficacy with experiments driven by real datasets .",
    "there are some open issues to study in our future work .",
    "first , when constructing a reliable seed set @xmath22 at the first step , we assumed the credibility of the self - reported locations and used the heuristic method to refine the seed set .",
    "for the future work , more advanced methods can be used to refine the seed set , and it is also interesting to check the impact of the seed set credibility on the ultimate performance .",
    "second , the accuracy of locinfer can be further improved by incorporating the existing content - based methods @xcite and other signals such as timezone and language .",
