    "gersten and short show in  @xcite that groups satisfying any of the usual non - metric small cancellation conditions c(6 ) , or c(4)-t(4 ) , or c(3)-t(6 ) are biautomatic .",
    "most of their argument with respect to c(3)-t(6 ) applies verbatim to a more general situation and yields small cancellation type presentations for a larger class of automatic groups .",
    "these presentations are essentially finite prees ( in the sense of frank rimlinger  @xcite ) which satisfy two axioms introduced by reinhold baer  @xcite .",
    "a pree , defined below , is a set with a partial multiplication satisfying certain axioms .",
    "an example is an amalgam of two groups ; the multiplication is defined for pairs of elements within each group but is not defined for pairs which are not within one group or the other .",
    "amalgams obey an additional axiom which make them pregroups as defined by john stallings  @xcite .",
    "see the recent survey  @xcite for an introduction to prees and their axioms .",
    "the axioms we employ , a(4 ) and a(5 ) , are given in section  [ prees ] .",
    "their relation to the usual small cancellation conditions is discussed at the beginning of section  [ cancellation ] , where we develop a variation of small cancellation theory .",
    "there are many such variations , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the one which which seem closest to ours is by uri weiss  @xcite , who shows that v(6 ) groups with all pieces of length 1 are biautomatic .",
    "v(6 ) denotes a generalization of the c(6 ) and c(4)-t(4 ) conditions .",
    "section 4 contains the proof of our main theorem , theorem  [ a45 ] , which says that the universal groups of finite prees satisfying axioms a(4 ) and a(5 ) are biautomatic . as every finite group satisfies these two axioms and",
    "is its own universal group , the class of groups covered by theorem  [ a45 ] includes all finite groups .",
    "finite c(3)-t(6 ) groups , on the other hand , are all cyclic  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to have other examples of groups from theorem  [ a45 ] which are not c(3)-t(6 ) .",
    "[ pree ] a pree is a set equipped with a partial multiplication which affords an identity , denoted @xmath0 , two - sided inverses , and the following form of associative law .",
    "it is not hard to show that inverses are unique in a pree .",
    "further if @xmath1 , then @xmath2 etc .",
    "it follows that products @xmath1 may be thought of as triangles .",
    "more precisely the six products obtained by reading the edge labels around the boundary of the triangle on the left - hand side of figure  [ triangles ] in either direction and starting at any vertex are defined if any one of them is . as usual",

    "the universal group of a pree @xmath8 is the group @xmath9 with generators @xmath8 and relators @xmath10 for every product @xmath1 defined in @xmath8 .",
    "we write @xmath11 for the image of @xmath12 in @xmath9 .",
    "elements of @xmath9 are represented by words over the alphabet @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath0 is a letter in this alphabet .",
    "[ reducible ] a word over @xmath8 is reducible if the product of two successive letters is defined in @xmath8 .",
    "otherwise the word is called irreducible or reduced .",
    "it is straightforward to use tietze transformations to change any finite presentation into one given by a finite partial multiplication table , and with more tietze transformations one can insure that this multiplication table satisfies the conditions of a pree . thus every finitely presented group is the universal group of a finite pree , and the pree affords a finite presentation for the group .",
    "[ embedding ] it is undecidable whether or not the canonical morphism @xmath13 from a pree @xmath8 to its universal group is an embedding .",
    "this theorem is a special case of a result of trevor evans  @xcite which says that if the embedding problem is solvable for a class of finite partial algebras , then the word problem is solvable for the corresponding class of algebras .",
    "now we present the additional axioms we need .",
    "there are two of them , and they have the geometric incarnations given in figure  [ spree ]     defined . [ spree ] ]    axiom a(4 ) : :    if the products @xmath14 ,    @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and    @xmath17 are defined , then at least one of the    products @xmath18 ( indices read modulo 4 ) is defined .",
    "axiom a(5 ) : :    if the products @xmath14 ,    @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,    @xmath19 and @xmath20    are defined , then at least one of the products    @xmath18 ( indices read modulo 5 ) is defined .",
    "we require a simple extension of small cancellation theory for diagrams constructed from triangles    all relations in the presentation @xmath8 for @xmath9 have length 3 , and there are no pieces of length 2 .",
    "indeed @xmath3 can occur in at most one relator , namely the relator @xmath10 corresponding to a product @xmath1 defined in @xmath8 . thus the small cancellation condition c(3 ) holds .",
    "similarly the condition t(6 ) says that the perimeter of any diagram formed by fitting 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 triangles around a common vertex ( as in figure  [ spree ] and the right - hand side of figure  [ triangles ] ) contains a subword @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "axioms a(4 ) and a(5 ) on the other hand together with the associative law enforce the weaker condition that the perimeter is reducible .",
    "a diagram is a planar directed labeled graph whose boundary is a simple closed curve and whose faces are triangles each with 3 distinct vertices .",
    "the label of the boundary of each face is a relator in @xmath8 .",
    "the number of triangular faces of a diagram is its area .",
    "the boundary word , determined up to cyclic permutation and inverse , is the label of the boundary path .",
    "boundaries of triangles are sometimes called perimeters . for brevity boundary words",
    "are sometimes themselves called boundaries .",
    "the label of a path in a diagram is the product of the labels of edges except that an edge traversed against its orientation contributes the inverse of its label .",
    "we may change the orientation of an edge as long as we invert its label . to remove a triangle with one or more edges on the boundary we remove the edges on the boundary except we keep any vertices which began with degree more than 2 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a diagram with area greater than one , there is a triangle in @xmath23 with one or more edges on the boundary such that removing that triangle results in a diagram .",
    "if there is a triangle with two edges on the boundary , then because the boundary is a simple closed curve , the common vertex has degree 2 , and the triangle may be removed . likewise a triangle with only one edge on the boundary and the opposite vertex in the interior of the diagram may be removed .",
    "suppose then that all triangles meeting the boundary have exactly one edge and its opposing vertex on the boundary .",
    "for each such triangle the complement of the diagram is divided into two parts . since the triangle has two edges not on the boundary , both parts have positive area .",
    "pick a triangle such that one of the complementary parts has minimum possible area .",
    "since that area is positive , it must contain another triangle meeting the boundary .",
    "but then that triangle would give a complementary part of smaller area .",
    "thus this last case can not arise .",
    "the preceding lemma has the following consequence .",
    "[ recursive ] every diagram is generated by starting with a single triangle and attaching subsequent triangles in the following way .",
    "a triangle is attached to a diagram by identifying one or two edges of the triangle with an edge or two successive edges respectively of the boundary of the diagram so that identified edges have the same label and are oriented in the same direction or have inverse labels and are oriented in opposite directions .",
    "in addition two vertices of a triangle may not be identified when it is attached .",
    "[ boundary ] if a diagram has two triangles with the same vertices , then it has an internal vertex of degree two .",
    "let @xmath23 be a diagram .",
    "if @xmath23 has area 1 , there is nothing to prove . otherwise @xmath23 is formed by attaching a triangle @xmath24 to a diagram @xmath25 of smaller area . by induction",
    "we may assume @xmath25 does not have two triangles with the same vertices .",
    "consequently the vertices of @xmath24 are also the vertices of some triangle @xmath26 of @xmath25 .",
    "but then these vertices must be the vertices of a path of length 2 on the boundary of @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that the middle vertex is an internal vertex of degree 2 in @xmath23 .",
    "a minimal diagram is one which has minimum area among all diagrams with the same boundary word ( up to cyclic permutation and inverse . ) .",
    "[ minimal ] let @xmath23 be a minimal diagram with boundary @xmath27 . if @xmath23 has an internal vertex of degree 2 , then @xmath23 consists of two triangles joined along two edges and @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to see that no vertex of any diagram has degree 1 .",
    "if @xmath29 is an internal vertex of degree 2 , then @xmath29 is a vertex of two triangles both of which contain the two edges incident to @xmath29 .",
    "hence both edges opposite @xmath29 have label @xmath30 . unless both of these edges are on the boundary of @xmath23 , they can be combined to make a diagram of smaller area .",

    "it follows that @xmath45 .",
    "we consider a fixed pree @xmath8 satisfying axioms a(4 ) and a(5 ) and show that it is biautomatic .",
    "much of our argument follows that in  @xcite .",
    "if an internal vertex @xmath29 has degree 3 , then by the associative law from definition  [ associative ] we can remove @xmath29 and all incident edges and still have a diagram over @xmath8 .",
    "likewise if @xmath29 has degree 4 or 5 , then axioms a(4 ) and a(5 ) guarantee that one can discard @xmath29 and construct a diagram of smaller area by adding one or two internal edges .",
    "we must check that each new triangle created by the addition of edges has all vertices distinct .",

    "by lemma  [ galleries ] there are either three boundary vertices of degree 2 or at least 4 boundary vertices .",
    "it follows that @xmath23 is a triangle .",
    "the proof of the next theorem is given in a sequence of lemmas .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind the following example @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "the partial multiplication in @xmath8 is inherited from the usual addition in @xmath60 .",
    "first we observe that lemma  [ galleries ] implies that in any diagram @xmath23 of minimum area there must be a number of intervals along the boundary consisting of two vertices of degree 2 or 3 either adjacent to each other or separated by vertices of degree 4 . as in",
    "@xcite we refer to these intervals as galleries .",
    "see figure  [ gallery ] .",
    "note that some of the vertices in this figure might be identified in @xmath23 .",
    "in other words there is a morphism of diagrams from the gallery as illustrated to @xmath23 . under this morphism",
    "the labeled vertices have distinct images and their degrees are preserved .",
    "a word @xmath61 over @xmath8 is irreducible if for all @xmath62 the product @xmath63 is not defined in @xmath8 , and it is strongly irreducible if in addition it can not be shortened by attaching to it a gallery of type @xmath64 as in figure  [ gallery ] and replacing @xmath65 by @xmath66 or @xmath67 by @xmath68 etc .",
    "reductions of this latter type are called strong reductions .    both reductions and strong reductions",
    "shorten a word s length by 1 .",
    "there are also reductions corresponding to other types of galleries .",
    "reductions corresponding to galleries of type @xmath69 shorten the length of a word by 2 .",
    "since galleries are diagrams over @xmath8 , it is clear that the above reductions do not change the element of @xmath9 represented by a word , over @xmath8 .",

    "[ geodesic ] a word @xmath27 over @xmath8 is the label of a geodesic in @xmath9 if and only if it is strongly reduced and not the word @xmath0 .",

    "further it is straightforward to construct a finite automaton over the alphabet @xmath70 which accepts a pair of words @xmath71 if and only if @xmath27 and @xmath41 are words over @xmath8 and @xmath41 is obtained from @xmath27 from a single reduction corresponding to attaching a gallery to @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath72 is a padding symbol not in @xmath8 .",
    "the triangles of @xmath8 can serve as the vertices of a suitable automaton .",
    "it follows by standard techniques that the set of all words over @xmath8 which are strongly reducible forms a regular language .",
    "hence its complement is regular and the intersection of the complement with the irreducible words not equal to @xmath0 is regular too .",

    "there can not be 3 vertices of degree 2 , because then at least one of them would be in the interior of @xmath27 or @xmath41 contradicting the fact that both are strongly irreducible .",
    "likewise there can be no gallery all of whose vertices of degree 3 or 4 lie in the interior of @xmath27 or in the interior of @xmath41 .",
    "thus there are 4 galleries and 2 vertices of degree 2 .",
    "the only way they all fit into @xmath23 is if @xmath77 , and the two boundary vertices separating the boundary segments with labels @xmath27 and @xmath41 are of degree 2 and are each part of two galleries .",
    "each gallery has a vertex of degree 2 or 3 at its other end .",
