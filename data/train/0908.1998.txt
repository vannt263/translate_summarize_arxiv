    "binary quasars are a rare but important aspect of galactic evolution and the agn phenomenon , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "studies of the nature and incidence of binary quasars provide insight into galaxy mergers at substantial look - back times and into the fueling of agn by accretion onto supermassive black holes . according to current cosmological models ,",
    "many large galaxies have undergone at least one major merger .",
    "a likely mechanism for agn fueling is the migration of gas caused by tidal torques in a merger .",
    "therefore , one might expect to see a substantial number of binary quasars .",
    "evidence for binary agn includes peculiar morphologies of radio galaxies , x - ray resolved double nuclei , and optically resolved double qsos . out of @xmath4 qsos",
    ", only @xmath5 optical binary quasars are known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "most have spacings of 10  kpc or more , and lie at @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where study of the host galaxy is difficult .",
    "binaries with smaller separations include a 2  kpc ( 0.3  arcsec ) optical example at @xmath8 observed with hst by @xcite , and the ulirg ngc 6240 with a double x - ray nucleus separated by 1.4  kpc @xcite .",
    "both authors argue that the observed incidence of such close binaries is roughly 100 times less than might be expected if the fueling of one black hole giving qso activity at the relevant stages of a merger mandates the fueling of the second black hole . a single , much closer ( 7  pc ) binary agn candidate is the radio galaxy 0402 + 379 @xcite .",
    "additional examples of optically resolved binary agn include a z=0.36 galaxy from the cosmos survey with a spacing of 2.5 kpc @xcite and a z=0.44 binary quasar with a spacing of 21 kpc @xcite .",
    "the narrow emission lines of agn offer a potential indicator of binary agn at intermediate separations of @xmath9 to 10  kpc .",
    "the radius of the narrow emission - line region ( nlr ) is typically a few hundred parsecs , so that such objects should have distinct nlrs orbiting with each of the merging nuclei with its black hole .",
    "typical orbital velocities in galaxies are of order a few hundred kilometers per second , similar to the widths of agn narrow lines . if two adjacent narrow - line regions in a merging system were detected by a single spectrograph slit or fiber , a double - peaked emission - line profile could result .",
    "this provides a technique for identifying candidate binary agn that are spatially unresolved .",
    "several examples have already been discussed in the literature @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied agn with narrow lines displaced in velocity from the host galaxy as possible examples of galactic mergers in progress , including two objects with double - peaked narrow lines .",
    "we have carried out a search for double - peaked narrow line profiles , primarily the  lines , in quasar spectra from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the goals of this work were to identify interesting individual objects for study , and to constrain the frequency of binary quasars in the relevant regime of separation .",
    "this search has identified 148 double - peaked  objects , with velocity splittings between 180  and 1400  .",
    "this includes roughly equal numbers of agn 1 ( broad lines ) and agn 2 ( narrow lines only ) .",
    "here we describe the search and the double - peaked objects , consider alternative causes of the double - peaked profiles , including bipolar jets and disk rotation , and discuss statistical inferences for agn fueling in merging galactic nuclei .",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology with h@xmath10 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "recently , two independent studies by @xcite and @xcite have appeared , involving narrow line agn 2 selected from the sdss galaxy database .",
    "these authors find a similar incidence of double  objects to that found here .",
    "the two studies are complementary to ours , in that our work emphasizes broad line objects .",
    "our spectra are obtained from sdss dr7 , which contains 21,592 qso spectra within our redshift range , @xmath13 . because it is possible",
    "to have strong  emission despite a noisy spectrum , we imposed no _ a priori _ signal - to - noise ( s / n ) cutoff .",
    "we conducted a visual inspection of the spectra in the region of several key emission lines .",
    "our primary search criterion was a double - peaked  profile in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 , consistent with the 3:1 intensity ratio fixed by atomic physics .",
    "once these objects had been identified , a more thorough inspection of each double  object was conducted with the iraf routine splot to determine whether the velocity splitting observed in  was detectable in other emission lines .",
    "the lines considered were  ,  ,  , [ ne  iii ]  , and .",
    "while confirmation of the  split in these lines strengthens the case , we did not require it for inclusion in the list of double - peaked objects if the s / n was such that the double - peak was not ruled out . for approximately 12 of our objects , the [ ne  v ]  line showed sufficient s / n to allow measurement of the split . in these cases , there was agreement with the  velocity split within about 10% , similar to the measurement accuracy .",
    "in a few more cases , the s / n allowed qualitative confirmation of the split by visual inspection .",
    "it appears that the split is seen in [ ne  v ]  whenever the s / n is adequate to see it , thus , the double - peaked profile extends to higher ionization lines in most if not all cases .",
    "however , [ ne  v ]  was rarely useful to confirm an  split that was not already confirmed by other lines .",
    "objects were grouped into two categories ,  good \" and  marginal . \"",
    "marginal objects are questionable cases due to low s / n , bad sky subtraction , and most often , failure of @xmath15 to reproduce the intensity ratio of the components in @xmath14 .",
    "our objects are listed in [ t : tab1 ] and their radio properties ( see discussion below ) are given in [ t : tab2 ] .    generally , the double - peaked profile was confirmed in lines such as [ ne  iii ]  @xmath16 and the narrow  component when the s / n was adequate . for the  @xmath17 ,",
    "the typical  double peak splitting of @xmath18 or @xmath19 is such that the @xmath20 of the lower redshift component falls on top of the @xmath21 line of the higher redshift component .",
    "this leads to a distinctive triple - peaked structure that was often seen when   was within the spectral range .",
    "for  @xmath22 , the profile rarely showed a double peak .",
    "the separation of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 lines is @xmath25 . for a typical  velocity split of @xmath26 , the @xmath23 line of the higher redshift component fills in the gap between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 lines of the lower redshift component .",
    "this often gives a single peaked profile . to verify this , we computed a simulated  blend for a typical candidate quasar using the relative intensity and velocity separation of the double - peaked  profile .",
    "the simulated  profile does not show the double peak .",
    "( in a few cases , the splitting is seen in .",
    "the most dramatic case is in j0126 + 14 , where the  is clearly resolved into two individual lines with the same 580  velocity splitting as in ) .",
    "because  is almost never resolved into two components ,  is split in all of our objects , and  often exhibits a triple - peaked structure , a distinctive 1 - 2 - 3 pattern is often seen in our objects if  is within the spectral range : one peak on , two peaks on , and three peaks on , as seen in figure [ fig : sulfur ] .    to confirm that both velocity components are typically present in",
    ", we measured the centroid wavelength of the  feature and compared this redshift with the redshift of the blue and red components of the double - peaked  profile . for a control sample of several normal qsos with single - peaked , the  and  redshifts agreed to within @xmath27 , assuming a typical doublet ratio @xmath28 @xcite . very few of our double - peaked  objects were consistent with an  doublet being present solely at either the red or blue  redshift . for",
    "the double peaked  objects , the  centroid was uniformly distributed between the red and blue  redshifts , consistent with the fact that the primary ( stronger )  peak can be either the red or blue peak with similar frequency .",
    "the  centroid redshift was on average 37% of the way from the primary  redshift to the secondary  redshift , implying that the stronger  component corresponds to the stronger  component in most objects .",
    "@xcite note the absence of a double peak for  in most double - peaked  agn , and suggest that this can be reconciled with a binary nature for these objects if the  region is spatially more extended than for .",
    "our results suggest that  does typically show both  velocity components , and no such explanation is necessary .",
    "many of our objects , including a number of the agn 1 , show stellar absorption lines from the host galaxy in their spectrum .",
    "this affords an opportunity to examine the velocity of the  components relative to the velocity of the host , as done by @xcite and @xcite for their agn 2 with double - peaked .",
    "in particular , wang et al . offer a possible `` virial '' test of binarity involving the relative fluxes and velocities of the  components . in order to estimate fluxes of the  components , and to have a measure of the velocities independent of the cursor measurements described above",
    ", we carried out double gaussian fits to the spectra of our double - peaked objects .",
    "the procedure assumed two gaussians for the two components of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 lines , with adjustable velocity , fwhm , and flux , and the 3:1 intensity ratio required by atomic physics .",
    "the continuum in the vicinity of  was fit with a second - order polynomial .",
    "the fit was optimized in a least - squares fashion .",
    "this procedure achieved a good fit to the total observed line profile in 106 of the 148 objects .",
    "for some of these objects , however , a visual inspection suggests that there could be substantially different choices for the amount of flux in the two components . for 85 of the 106 successful fits",
    ", we judged that the allocation of flux to the two components was unambiguous ; these values are given in in table [ t : tab3 ] .",
    "we found reasonable agreement between the velocities measured with splot and the gaussian fits .",
    "for example , the difference between the splot and gaussian redshifts of the red  component had a mean of 16  and an r.m.s .",
    "scatter of 50  in the rest frame . in most of the cases with a larger discrepancy , inspection of the fits suggested that the splot measurements were more reliable , perhaps because the  line is typically more sharply peaked than a gaussian .",
    "we have used the splot velocities below ; use of the gaussian velocities would not alter our conclusions .",
    "host galaxy velocities were determined by cross - correlating a template galaxy spectrum with the observed spectrum with the aid of the iraf routine fxcor used in interactive mode .",
    "all 148 of the double  spectra were visually examined in the region containing the mgb and nad lines . if these features were visually detected ( 73 objects ) , the spectrum was tagged and converted to a linear wavelength scale spanning 3600 - 8500    with dispersion of 2.0  / pixel .",
    "the cross - correlation template was generated with the same wavelength scale and dispersion , using an early type galaxy sdss spectral template .",
    "fxcor was used to cross - correlate each galaxy spectrum with the template .",
    "a cubic spline was used to model and subtract out the mean continuum shape and a cosine bell was used to apodize 1% of each 1d spectrum at both ends .",
    "interactive options were used to cross - correlate the spectra only around the mgb - nad region of the spectrum . if a well defined cross - correlation peak was not visible , the cross - correlation output was rejected .",
    "this procedure was successful for 67 objects , of which 46 have  component fluxes in table [ t : tab3 ] . table [ t : tab1 ] gives the host galaxy redshift .",
    "the host redshifts have an average uncertainty of 45  in the rest frame , with a maximum uncertainty of 95  .",
    "we have a total of 148 double - peaked  objects , listed in table [ t : tab1 ] .",
    "objects with an asterisk exhibit either binarity or signs of interaction in the sloan image . also given are the sdss redshift , the velocity separation of the  peaks , the continuum luminosity , and the agn type ( 1 if broad emission lines are visible ) .",
    "the  quality \" column denotes whether the object is good , @xmath31 , or marginal , @xmath32 .",
    "there are 78 good and 70 marginal objects .",
    "while marginal objects do have a listed velocity splitting , these measurements are uncertain in some cases .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] gives spectra for three representative objects .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] gives the sdss multi - color images of the eight visually interesting objects .",
    "two of these , j1316 + 17 and j1441 + 09 , are included because they exhibit numerous smaller companions within a close radius .",
    "three of the images appear to consist of two or more individual galaxies at very close proximity : j1245 + 37 and j1307 + 46 appear to show pairs of galaxies centered on the sdss fiber , and j1157 + 08 , shows three galaxies in a linear arrangement .",
    "j0942 + 12 exhibits large tidal tails in the image , suggesting recent interaction . however , the nucleus itself does not appear binary .",
    "j1001 + 28 may be a major merger between a large spiral and a spiral or elliptical .",
    "while the fiber width is not enough to encompass the nlrs of both objects , the galaxy is clearly undergoing interaction .",
    "j1516 + 18 ( not shown ) has 1.3 jy of radio flux , an order of magnitude larger than any other object in our sample .",
    "the object is a good double , although the velocity split which is clear in  is not seen in other lines .",
    "j1517 + 33 is discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "it has emission line knots that straddle the stellar nucleus in velocity and position .",
    "the double peaked profile appears to be the result of a bipolar radio jet .",
    "we did not impose an _ a priori _ s / n cutoff , in order to avoid missing noisy but interesting objects with strong  lines .",
    "however , some of the sdss spectra did not have sufficient s / n to show the typical  double peaks displayed by our objects .",
    "therefore , for statistical analysis , we must estimate what fraction of the full quasar sample had sufficient quality to be considered the parent sample of our double - peaked objects .",
    "we find by inspection of a substantial subset of the 21,592 objects that only @xmath33 of spectra are viable in the sense that the double peaks of @xmath15 , as present in a typical `` good '' object , would be clearly distinguishable from the noise . while subjective , this estimate is reasonably sound because of the strong contrast between the s / n of the better and worse spectra .",
    "moreover , there are larger uncertainties in the analysis below , such as corrections for binaries with line - of - sight velocities too small to give a double - peaked  profile ( see below ) .",
    "an issue for statistical analysis is the presence of some agn 2 in the sdss quasar download , numbering about 2.1% of the full sample .",
    "interestingly , 42%  of our objects are narrow - line objects , so that the type 2 objects are twenty times overrepresented among our double  objects .",
    "we believe this to be a selection effect .",
    "sdss defines a quasar as having one or more emission lines with fwhm of at least 1000  , intended to eliminate narrow - line objects .",
    "evidently , the pipeline failure responsible for the presence of some agn 2 in the parent sample is influenced by a double - peaked profile .",
    "because of this dramatic selection effect , we omit the type 2 objects from our statistical analysis .    after subtracting 2.1% for the type 2 objects",
    ", we have a parent sample of 8,452 viable type 1 spectra .",
    "our 86 type 1 double  objects amount to 1.0%  of the parent sample ; 42 of these ( 0.50%  of the parent sample ) are  good \" .",
    "our incidence of 1.0%  double - peaked agn  1 is similar to the incidence of 1.1%  for agn  2 in the study of @xcite .",
    "our double - peaked agn were cross - referenced with the first radio catalogue @xcite .",
    "only four of our objects were outside the footprint of the first survey .",
    "first detects 20  cm radio flux for 27%  of our type 1 objects ( detection limit 1 mjy ) , as compared to only 9%  first detections in the overall sdss quasar catalogue in our redshift range @xcite . in other words ,",
    "radio detection is three times overrepresented among our double - peaked  objects .",
    "this suggests that radio jet interaction is often the cause of the double - peaked  profiles .",
    "such interactions in the nlr are well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one of our double  objects , j1517 + 33 , appears to involve such an interaction .",
    "it is a narrow - line object with a first radio flux of 107  mjy and two bright optical regions near its nucleus in the sloan image .",
    "subsequent observations of this object with the vla have shown a double - lobed radio structure at the same orientation and position as the bright optical regions . this object is discussed in @xcite .",
    "we give the radio fluxes , luminosities , and the @xcite radio loudness parameter in table [ t : tab2 ] .",
    "we adopt the radio - loudness conventions used in @xcite . the ratio @xmath34 measures the ratio of 6 cm radio flux density to @xmath35    optical flux density .",
    "if @xmath36 , we call an object radio quiet , @xmath37 is radio intermediate , and @xmath38 is radio loud .",
    "if an object is not detected in the first sample , we refer to it as radio undetected .",
    "it should be noted that the lack of a first detection does not indicate a total absence of radio flux , or of radio jets .",
    "high redshift objects with no first detection may have marginal flux which could have been detected at lower redshifts , and orientation of the radio source can affect detected flux . therefore some objects with radio jets may fall below the first detection limit .    additionally , type 2 spectra are dominated by the light of the host galaxy , which clouds the meaning of the radio - to - optical flux .",
    "consequently , the @xmath39 ratios given in table [ t : tab2 ] for type 2 objects should be taken with caution .",
    "because our study focuses on broad - line objects and we omit the agn 2 from our statistical interpretation , this issue does not affect our conclusions .",
    "because of the likelihood of radio jets causing the double - peaked signature , we consider our best candidates for true binaries to be those with no first radio detections . discarding 9%   of the parent sample to allow for first - detected objects ,",
    "our parent sample consists of 7,692 quasars .",
    "our double - peaked sample consists of 66 radio undetected broad - line objects , those we consider to be the best prospects .",
    "this is 0.9%  of the total number of viable sdss radio undetected broad - line quasars .",
    "if we use only the  good \" objects , 29 remain , which is 0.38%   of the parent sample .",
    "figure [ fig : redshift ] shows the relationship between the redshift and the velocity split for our double - peaked agn .",
    "objects at greater distance are typically at higher luminosity , and more luminous objects tend to have wider  lines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "accordingly , a larger velocity difference would be necessary for a resolved double - peaked profile .",
    "it would make sense , therefore , that as redshift increases , observed velocity splits should also increase .",
    "however , we find that the opposite is true .",
    "it appears that at high redshifts , the typical velocity splitting actually decreases , although the statistical sample is small .",
    "when the redshift plot is made separately for agn 1 and agn 2 , a distinctive gap is seen among the agn 2 between redshifts 0.3 and 0.5 . in a control sample of the sdss agn 2 in our quasar download",
    ", we also see a gap in that redshift range .",
    "we assume therefore that the gap results from the failure in the sdss pipeline that allowed some agn 2 into the quasar sample in the first place .    for our entire set of double - peaked objects ,",

    ", @xcite found a typical @xmath46 larger by a factor @xmath47 than the fwhm of each component .",
    "the `` good '' objects are definite cases of double - peaked  profiles .",
    "the split is confirmed with good s / n and velocity agreement in @xmath30 , and in other narrow lines when there is adequate s / n . for the marginal cases , the confirmation is less compelling in @xmath30 , and the s / n may be inadequate in other lines . in order to estimate the frequency with which noise might give the appearance of a double - peaked  profile , we examined a set of simulated single - peaked spectra for 1,773 sdss quasars computed by @xcite as a test of their procedures .",
    "these objects are typical of our double - peaked sample in terms of  strength and continuum s / n .",
    "the simulated spectra reproduce the observed emission lines for each quasar , using a gauss - hermite fit to the lines in the original spectrum as described by @xcite , along with a power - law continuum approximating the observed continuum in the  region .",
    "gaussian random noise was added pixel - by - pixel using the noise amplitude given in hdu3 of the sdss spectrum . for the present purposes ,",
    "the simulated spectra were visually inspected in the same manner as our actual sdss parent sample . in no case",
    "did a double - peaked @xmath29 profile appear as a result of noise that would have met our standards even for a `` marginal '' object .",
    "we conclude that all of the `` good '' and most of the `` marginal '' objects are in fact genuine double - peaked  agn .",

    "this indicates that most are indeed agn .",
    "as noted above , alternative interpretations of double - peaked  profiles include jet interactions and rotation .",
    "one of our type 2 objects , j1517 + 33 , is spatially resolved but is clearly an example of a radio jet interaction with the nlr @xcite .",
    "another of our objects , j1129 + 60 , was observed with the vla by rosario et al .",
    "it also has kpc scale radio structure and may involve jet interaction .",

    "the others are unresolved in the sdss images and may be candidates for binary agn at spacings less than about 5  kpc , depending on redshift . high resolution imaging in the optical , radio , and x - ray is needed to help determine which are actually binary agn .",
    "pending such studies , can other arguments offer guidance as to which objects are binaries or disturbed nlrs , or at least indicate the proportions of such objects in our sample ?",
    "the velocity separation of the double peaks is plausible for binary agn in most cases . for a circular orbit in the gravitational potential of an isothermal sphere of velocity dispersion ,",

    "the utility of emission line ratios to distinguish binaries from disturbed nlrs is unclear .",

    "such a reddening differential is expected for bipolar jets but not for binary agn or a rotating disk geometry .",

    "figure [ fig : virial ] suggests some inverse relationship between the velocity and flux ratios , considerably weaker than @xmath75 . however , the sample is small ( 23 useful objects ) , and our agn  2 sample is subject to unknown biases , as discussed above .",
    "one of our objects , sdss j131642.90 + 175332.5 , was the subject of a detailed study by @xcite .",
    "these authors consider alternative explanations of the double - peaked lines , including a binary agn , biconical outflow , jet - cloud interaction , and other complexities in the nlr geometry .",
    "they suggest that binaries might be more common in quasars than in seyfert galaxies , on the assumption that major mergers are more often involved in fueling quasars .",
    "we have examined our sample for such a trend . for luminosity bins @xmath76 in the ranges ( @xmath7743.5 , 43.5 - 44.0 , 44.0 - 44.5 , 44.5 - 45.0 , @xmath78 45.0 ) , the number of agn 1 s in our sample is ( 4 , 20 , 34 , 24 , 4 ) .",
    "these counts represent ( 0.35 , 0.30 , 0.39 , 0.74 , 1.13 ) percent of the number of objects in the parent sample in the corresponding luminosity bins . for reference ,",
    "the seyfert / quasar boundary is @xmath79 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath80 .",
    "the incidence of double peaks increases roughly a factor of two across our range of luminosities .",
    "this resembles the factor of two increase in the incidence of double - peaked  with increasing  luminosity found by @xcite in their study of agn  2 .",
    "this could be indicative of a substantial number of binaries among our sample .",
    "however , the origin of bipolar jets in agn is not fully understood , and jets affecting the nlr could be more common in higher luminosity agn .",
    "we suggest here another statistical argument involving the velocity splitting that may give an indication of the nature of the double - peaked narrow line agn .",
    "this involves a comparison of the typical velocity separation for type 1 ( broad lines ) and type 2 agn ( narrow lines only ) . in the unified model of agn @xcite",
    ", agn 1 are viewed relatively close to the disk axis , whereas agn 2 are viewed closer to the disk plane . in agn 2 ,",
    "the `` dusty torus '' obscures the central continuum source and blr .",
    "thus , the typical velocity projection onto the line of sight may differ between agn  1 and agn  2 .",
    "( 1 ) in the bipolar jet picture , the observed splitting is a function of the observer s location relative to the jet axis , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the true velocity separation . in the unified model , on average , agn",
    "1 should have larger observed velocity separations than agn 2 . consider a simple model in which all objects have the same @xmath82 , and in which all objects have a torus opening angle of 45 degrees .",
    "let @xmath83 represent the average observed velocity splitting for agn 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "then for agn 1 , @xmath84 , where the average is over polar angles of 0 to 45 degrees ; and for agn  2 , the range of @xmath85 is from 45 to 90 degrees .",
    "this gives @xmath86 for agn 1 and 0.35 for agn 2 , so that @xmath87 .",
    "however , this exaggerates the effect , because there is a minimum splitting for the double - peaked profile to be resolved .",
    "our results suggest a value for this @xmath88 of about 200  . for a rough estimate of this correction ,",
    "let us take @xmath89 , based on the mean splitting for our agn 1 .",
    "thus , agn with @xmath90 will not show double peaks .",
    "the range of polar angles for agn 2 to show double peaks is then 45 to 66 degrees , giving @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "( 2 ) in a rotating disk model with circular velocity @xmath93 , the observed velocity splitting is @xmath94 , where @xmath95 . by a similar procedure to that above , we find @xmath96 for @xmath97 or @xmath98 using @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the sense of the difference between agn 1 and 2 is reversed from the jet case , but the magnitude of the effect is similar .",
    "( 3 ) for binaries , the prediction is less clear",
    ". observationally , only one of the two agn need be a type 1 for broad lines to be observed .",
    "if the dusty tori of both objects tend to be coplanar with the orbit , then the situation resembles case ( 2 ) above for a rotating disk , and agn 1 might show smaller velocity separations than agn 2 . if there is little correlation between the orbital plane and the dusty tori , then @xmath100 and @xmath101 should be similar .",
    "our observed double - peaked  objects have @xmath102 for agn 1 and @xmath103 for agn 2 ( standard error of the mean ) .",
    "the agn 1 and 2 samples have closely similar mean luminosities in , consistent with similar underlying agn luminosities .",
    "the observed ratio of @xmath104 disagrees with a predominance of either bipolar jets or disks , if the above estimates are roughly correct .",
    "this result , by itself , might suggest either similar numbers of disks and jets , or a predominance of binaries .",
    "we refrain from drawing conclusions , however , because of possible biases related to the presence of type 2 agn in our sample .    the double - peaked objects of @xcite , all agn 2 , have @xmath105 , close to our value .",
    "our sample has a mean redshift of @xmath106 and 0.27 for agn 1 and 2 , respectively . for liu et al .",
    "the mean redshift is 0.16 , and only 0.088 for wang et al .",
    "for a subset of our lower redshift type 1 agn having an average redshift of 0.158 , similar to that of liu et al . , we find that our average velocity splitting is @xmath107 , within @xmath73 of liu et al.s sample , and that @xmath108 , again consistent with binaries .",
    "if we compare liu et al.s agn  2 to our full sample of type 1 objects , we find @xmath109 .",
    "the objects of @xcite have @xmath110 , but their sample has a much smaller average redshift of 0.088 , and their mean  luminosity @xmath111 is an order - of - magnitude smaller than for our sample .",
    "the width of the narrow emission lines correlates with  empirically , with @xmath112 , where @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the profile will appear double - peaked if the velocity separation is greater than @xmath114 .",
    "given that the orbital velocity of a binary should be of this order ( see above ) , one might expect that some binaries will show a double - peaked  profile and others will not .",
    "moreover , a substantial fraction of binaries may be at a low velocity phase of an eccentric orbit , and many will have their relative velocity vector close to the plane of the sky .",
    "the true number of binaries ( or otherwise disturbed nlrs ) may be several times larger than the number of double - peaked objects observed .",
    "@xcite estimate that this correction may be an order - of - magnitude .",
    "thus , if a large fraction of our radio - undetected type 1 objects are binaries , then the implied true incidence of binaries is as large as @xmath115 .",
    "however , such a large fraction of binaries appears to conflict with the statistics of spatially resolved agn ( see below ) .",
    "this in turn suggests that only a small fraction of the double - opeaked  objects are in fact binary agn .",
    "the role of mergers in fueling agn activity is an important topic of study . while seemingly undisturbed agn are observed",
    ", high resolution imaging of quasars shows close companions and and features of gravitational interaction in many cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of galactic collisions with gas show that tidal torques lead to concentrations of gas in each nucleus after the first close encounter , and in the nucleus of the final merger product ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it seems likely that a large fraction of luminous agn are triggered by mergers .",
    "this suggests that binary agn would be a common occurrence .    as noted above",
    ", the incidence of known close binaries at 1 or 2  kpc separation is only @xmath116 , and it has been argued that this is lower than expected if both black holes in a merger are fueled independently @xcite . a similar conclusion is also reached by @xcite , in a study of optically resolved binaries in the 10 to 100  kpc range . in our case ,",
    "a typical redshift is @xmath117 , and a 1  arcsec limit on our unresolved objects corresponds to @xmath118  kpc .",
    "what might one expect for the number of binaries in this range of separation ?",
    "for an orbital velocity of @xmath119 and radius of 3  kpc , the orbital period is @xmath120  yr .",
    "dynamical friction causes the orbit to decay on a timescle  of a few times ; for typical parameters for our objects , @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of an agn outburst is often estimated to be the salpeter growth timescale @xmath122  yr .",
    "thus , the duration of an agn outburst could be a substantial fraction of @xmath123 .",
    "the fact that the galaxy is observed as an agn implies that at least one black hole is currently fueled . if fueling of each hole occurs independently , then the probability that a given agn will have both holes fueled as a binary agn is @xmath124 .",
    "this assumes that most agn are triggered by mergers .",
    "this theoretical estimate is considerably larger than our observed @xmath125 incidence of double  objects but similar to the above @xmath126 estimate after correction for unresolved double  objects .",
    "it is doubtful that the true incidence of binary agn is so high , however .",
    "the number of resolved binary qsos at the 2  kpc scale and the 30  kpc scale is @xmath116 in both cases , based on objects at typical redshifts of 1 to 3 @xcite . if these indications of a low binary rate carry over to our redshift and separation range",
    ", this may imply that most of the double  objects are in fact single agn with a disturbed nlr .",
    "a low number of optically visible binary agn could result from a delay in fueling of the black holes until the orbital separation has decayed below the kpc scale , or obscuration of most binary agn at kpc separations by massive amounts of dusty gas @xcite . in this context , it is interesting that ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) often show nuclear spacings of one or several kpc @xcite .",
    "we have found that approximately 1%  of broad - line sdss quasars at @xmath13 have double - peaked  line profiles , and other narrow lines show similar velocity splittings when the data quality is sufficient . in most cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the velocities is consistent with orbital motion in binary agn with distinct nlrs .",
    "however , many of the objects , including those with first radio detections , are likely disturbed nlrs involving bipolar jets or other complexities .",
    "we have discussed a number of potential statistical tests of which mechanism accounts for most of the double - peaked objects , but available data are not definitive .",
    "agn with double - peaked narrow lines are interesting individual targets for detailed study .",
    "in addition , they offer a potential way to assess the probability of simultaneous fueling of both black holes in a galactic merger . in order to realize this potential , further study of these objects , including high resolution imaging in the radio , optical , and x - ray ,",

    "<S> we present agn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) having double - peaked profiles of  @xmath0 and other narrow emission - lines , motivated by the prospect of finding candidate binary agn . </S>",
    "<S> these objects were identified by means of a visual examination of 21,592 quasars at @xmath1 in sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ) . of the spectra with adequate signal - to - noise , 148 spectra exhibit a double - peaked  profile . of these , 86 are type 1 agn and 62 are type 2 agn . only two give the appearance of possibly being optically resolved double agn in the sdss images , but many show close companions or signs of recent interaction . </S>",
    "<S> radio - detected quasars are three times more likely to exhibit a double - peaked  profile than quasars with no detected radio flux , suggesting a role for jet interactions in producing the double - peaked profiles . of the 66 broad line ( type 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> agn that are undetected in the first survey , 0.9% show double peaked  profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss statistical tests of the nature of the double - peaked objects . </S>",
    "<S> further study is needed to determine which of them are binary agn rather than disturbed narrow line regions , and how many additional binaries may remain undetected because of insufficient line - of - sight velocity splitting .    </S>",
    "<S> previous studies indicate that 0.1%  of sdss quasars are spatially resolved binaries , with typical spacings of @xmath2 to 100  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> if a substantial fraction of the double - peaked objects are indeed binaries , then our results imply that binaries occur more frequently at smaller separations ( @xmath3  kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that simultaneous fueling of both black holes is more common as the binary orbit decays through these spacings . </S>"
