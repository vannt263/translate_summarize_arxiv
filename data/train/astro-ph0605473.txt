    "the color of a galaxy is determined primarily by its star formation history ( sfh ) and the amount of dust attenuation present , with significant additional contributions from metallicity and dust geometry .",
    "an empirical relation between sfh , dust attenuation , and color is therefore a useful constraint on models of galaxy formation , and can aid in the interpretation of high redshift galaxy observations where measurements are difficult .",
    "here we investigate such an empirical relation , using a representative sample of galaxies observed from the ultraviolet to the infrared by _ galex _ , sdss , and _",
    "spitzer_. the long wavelength coverage allows us to construct simple but robust measures of dust attenuation that are relatively free of a dependence on sfh .",
    "similarly , the sdss spectroscopy allows us to measure sfh diagnostics  we use a 4000   break measure  that are largely free of a dependence on dust attenuation .",
    "earlier studies of the effect of dust on galaxy colors have focused on the ultraviolet ( uv , @xmath6 ) colors of galaxies .",
    "a primary reason for this is that the intrinsic , underlying uv color ( before attenuation ) is relatively insensitive to the sfh of the galaxy , when compared to the effects of dust attenuation .",
    "also , studies of the highest redshift galaxies are often restricted to the restframe uv so that estimates of dust attenuation must be made using uv colors .",
    "@xcite derived the effective attenuation properties of dust in star - bursting galaxies by comparing the total dust absorption",
    " measured from the ratio of dust emission to uv emission  to the change in uv color of a sample of starforming galaxies ( the so - called irx-@xmath5 relation ) .",
    "this locally derived relation has been used extensively to determine the dust attenuation in galaxies at higher redshift using their uv colors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , more recent studies @xcite have shown that there is significant scatter in this relation , especially when less rapidly starforming galaxies are included .",
    "@xcite show , using stellar population synthesis models with significant recent bursts , that both sfh and dust are expected to affect the uv color of normal galaxies since at a constant value of dust attenuation galaxies with an older stellar population should appear redder in the uv because of their redder intrinsic uv spectra .",
    "they thus propose that a measure of sfh  specifically the 4000   break  can be used to explain the scatter in the irx-@xmath5 relation .",
    "we have constructed a sample of galaxies observed from the uv to the mid / far - infrared .",
    "our primary data set is the sample of local ( @xmath2 ) galaxies observed spectroscopically by sdss and analyzed by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter sdss / mpa galaxies ) .",
    "the uv data is taken from pipeline processed _ galex _",
    "observations of the lockman hole , with exposure times of @xmath7 ks .",
    "the pipeline - produced _ galex _ catalogs are searched for objects within 3 `` of the sdss / mpa galaxy locations , and the nearest object is taken as the match to the sdss galaxy .",
    "uv flux measurements are made in elliptical kron apertures . in the optical we use",
    "sdss petrosian magnitudes .",
    "the infrared data is provided by the swire _ spitzer _",
    "observations of the lockman hole @xcite . we have performed aperture photometry in the swire team processed 3.6 through 7.8   irac images and 24   mips images at the location of each of the sdss / mpa galaxies , using a 7 '' radius aperture ( 12 \" at 24 ) .",
    "the fluxes are then aperture corrected to total magnitudes .",
    "systematic errors in ir flux due to calibration uncertainty , aperture corrections , and the resolved nature of many of the sources amount to @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting uv through 3.6   magnitudes are @xmath9-corrected to @xmath10 ( e.g. @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etc . ) using the method of @xcite . at longer wavelengths",
    "dust emission becomes more important than stellar emission , and we use a different method to ` @xmath9-correct ' the data : we choose the best fitting redshifted @xcite model ir sed , on the basis of the observed 8 to 24   flux ratio .",
    "this sed is then normalized using the measured 24   flux , and the integrated far - infrared ( 8 - 1000 ) dust luminosities ( @xmath13 ) are derived .",
    "note that the different @xcite seds have @xmath14 ratios that are different by a factor of up to five .",
    "we have checked that our results would not change significantly if we use the model seds of @xcite ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of predicting ir luminosities from _ spitzer _",
    "data ) .",
    "our final selection of galaxies consists of those sdss / mpa galaxies with detections in the far - uv ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and near - uv ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) through 24   bands .",
    "this is a total of 467 of the 645 sdss / mpa galaxies within the @xmath19 deg@xmath20 of sdss/_galex_/_spitzer _ overlap .",
    "these galaxies have a stellar mass range of @xmath21 @xmath22   and a sfr range of @xmath23 @xmath22@xmath24 , as determined by @xcite and @xcite from the optical spectra and photometry . to simplify the present analysis",
    "we do not consider upper limits or selection effects except to note that we are biased against galaxies with very low @xmath25 or @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , we recover a significant number of galaxies which appear ` old ' and elliptical but have low levels of uv and ir emission .",
    "one of the primary motivations for compiling the sample of galaxies described above was to construct a robust and model independent measure of dust attenuation , the so - called infrared excess ( irx , see @xcite for a discussion of the relation of infrared excess to uv attenuation ) .",
    "we adopt the definition @xmath26 where @xmath13 is the 8 - 1000   dust luminosity as determined above and @xmath27 is the luminosity in the @xmath28 band ( @xmath29 ) . a second available dust indicator is the h@xmath30to h@xmath31decrement ( see @xcite and references therein ) , measured from the sdss spectra .",
    "this dust measure is only well defined for those galaxies with strong emission lines , and can not be easily compared to global galaxy measures due to spectroscopic aperture effects .",
    "we do not consider it in the present study .",
    "we take the strength of the 4000   break in galaxies as an indicator of sfh @xcite .",
    "this has been measured from the deredshifted sdss spectra by @xcite using the ratio of the flux in two narrow bands ( @xmath32 ) centered at 4050   and 3900 .",
    "this narrowband color , d@xmath33 , is less sensitive to reddening by dust than broadband colors .",
    "it is not , however , completely insensitive to dust effects @xcite .",
    "note that d@xmath33   is only measured within the 3 \" sdss aperture , which can cause an overestimate of the integrated d@xmath33   for galaxies with moderate bulge to disk ratios .",
    "we do not consider in detail the relation between d@xmath33   and more physical measures of galaxy age or sfh ( e.g. the ratio of current to past averaged star formation rate or the specific star formation rate ) , which is metallicity dependent and requires population synthesis modeling .",
    "models of galaxy spectra have suggested that the uv color of galaxies can be decomposed into contributions from dust and sfh , though the effect of dust is the dominant contribution @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : bigfig ] we show the relation between irx and color for different ranges of d@xmath33 .",
    "we find a marginal dependence of the irx vs. @xmath34 relation ( analogous to the irx-@xmath5 relation ) on d@xmath33 . only the very oldest galaxies ( red points ) have systematically redder @xmath34 for the same value of irx , but also have larger errors . for galaxies with d@xmath33@xmath35",
    "there appears to be little dependence of the scatter on galaxy sfh .",
    "this is similar to the result of @xcite , who use the @xmath36k color as a measure of sfh ( but see below for the effect of dust on the @xmath36nir color ) .",
    "this result can be reconciled with the models of @xcite in several ways .",
    "first , some stars contributing to the dust heating ( and therefore the ir emission ) may not be contributing to the uv emission or , conversely , some stars contributing to the uv emission are not contributing to the ir emission ( i.e. a decoupling of ir and uv emission ) .",
    "this may occur for various reasons including star - dust geometry ( e.g. @xcite ) and contributions to dust heating from older stellar populations .",
    "related to this , d@xmath33   may not be measuring the relevant timescale for changes in the uv spectrum .",
    "the sfh diagnostic that is likely to be most relevant to changes in the uv spectral shape is the ratio of current sfr to the sfr averaged over the last 100 myr @xcite , which is not probed well by d@xmath33 .",
    "second , weak agn may affect the uv colors .",
    "third , the entire range of @xmath34 color is @xmath37 mag , compared to a median error of @xmath38 mag .",
    "the scatter due to measurement error may obscure a trend in the scatter with sfh .",
    "the results of @xcite were based on a library of 95000 model spectra , which may not be well represented by our sample .",
    "these and other possibilities will be investigated in future work .    for @xmath39 color it is easy to see the effect of sfh that was predicted by @xcite for the @xmath34 color . at a given low d@xmath33   ( i.e. younger mean stellar age , purple points )",
    "the relation between dust and color is clear , and has low scatter .",
    "this relation is closely related to the effective attenuation curve of the dust in these galaxies @xcite . for intermediate d@xmath33   ( i.e.  intermediate mean stellar age , orange or green points ) the relation between dust and color persists with low scatter , but the entire relation is shifted to redder color .",
    "this is presumably because of the redder intrinsic spectrum of an older stellar population , on top of which the effect of dust attenuation on color persists relatively unchanged .",
    "for @xmath40 the ratio of the median error to the range in color is significantly smaller than for @xmath34 , making trends with color easier to see .    at the largest d@xmath33",
    "the scatter in the irx - color relation increases  this may be due to several causes .",
    "first , there are larger errors in irx ( and color ) for these galaxies , which have relatively little star formation and are systematically dimmer in @xmath15 and at 24 .",
    "second , the effects of metallicity on d@xmath33   become more pronounced at high d@xmath33 .",
    "third , some uv emission may be due to evolved populations ( e.g. bhb stars ) .",
    "finally , these galaxies may well host agn that affect the ir and/or uv emission , changing irx .      in figure",
    "[ fig : model ] we present another projection of the dust - sfh - color relation .",
    "here we show d@xmath33   as a function of @xmath39 color for different ranges of irx .",
    "irx appears to be well determined using just @xmath39 and d@xmath33 .",
    "the relation between d@xmath33   and @xmath40 shifts to redder color for galaxies with more dust , while the slope of the relation remains nearly constant .",
    "galaxies in the lower right of this plot are predominantly dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "galaxies in the lower left are typically blue star - forming galaxies or dwarfs / irregulars . galaxies in the upper right of figure [ fig : model ]",
    "are red - sequence galaxies composed primarily of old stars , with very low levels of uv and ir emission .",
    "we have conducted quantitative parametric fits to the relation between dust attenuation , sfh , and the @xmath41   color .",
    "considering a simple effective attenuation law we are motivated to consider polynomial fits to the color ( @xmath42 ) , d@xmath33 , and an expression of irx that is linearly related to color @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bolometric correction to the uv and the bolometric correction to the ir has been made in ",
    "[ sec : data ] ( see @xcite for a discussion of the relation between irx and the true uv attenuation @xmath45 ) .",
    "we treat the color and d@xmath33   as independent variables ( since the errors are much smaller than for irx ) .",
    "we assume either a linear or quadratic form for the relation between color and d@xmath33 .",
    "the results are given in table [ table : fit ] .",
    "examination of the residuals shows that a cross term ( @xmath46d@xmath33@xmath47 ) is required , and fits including such a term are also given in table  [ table : fit ] .",
    "the fit from the 3rd row of table  [ table : fit ] is overplotted in figure  [ fig : model ] , and the residuals in irx as a function of color and d@xmath33   are shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] .",
    "figure [ fig : fit ] shows that the fit is poorer for redder colors and larger d@xmath33 .",
    "this may be due to the effects listed in  [",
    "sec : irx_color ] for the @xmath41   color , as well as the effect of aperture on d@xmath33   (  [ sec : sfh ] ) . at bluer colors ( @xmath41@xmath48 ) and",
    "smaller d@xmath33   the residuals are lower , @xmath49 rms in @xmath50 .",
    "table [ table : fit ] also includes fits using the @xmath51 color since this is more easily measured for a large sample of galex observed sdss galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior is similar to the @xmath41   color though the residuals are larger .",
