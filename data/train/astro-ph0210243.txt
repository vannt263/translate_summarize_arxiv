    "the cosmic baryon budget at low and high redshift indicates that a large fraction of baryons in the local universe have so far escaped detection ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan , & peebles  1998 ) .",
    "while there is clear evidence that a significant fraction of these `` missing baryons '' ( between 20 - 40% of total baryons ) lie in photoionized , low - redshift ly@xmath0 clouds ( penton , shull , & stocke  2000 ) , the remainder could be located in intergalactic space with temperatures of @xmath1 k ( warm - hot intergalactic medium , or whim ) .",
    "resonant absorption from highly - ionized ions located in the whim gas has been predicted based on both analytic studies of structure formation and evolution ( shapiro & bahcall  1981;perna & loeb  1998;fang & canizares  2000 ) and cosmic hydrodynamic simulations ( hellsten , gnedin , & miralda - escud ' e  1998;cen & ostriker  1999a;dav ' e et al .  2001;fang , bryan , & canizares  2002 ) .",
    "recent discovery of absorption lines by the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) ( see , e.g. , tripp & savage  2000 ) indicates that there may be a significant reservoir of baryons in absorbers .",
    "while li - like probes about @xmath2 of the whim gas ( cen et al .",
    "2001;fang & bryan  2001 ) , the remaining @xmath3 is hotter and can only be probed by ions with higher ionization potentials , such as h- and he - like oxygen , through x - ray observation .",
    "recently , with _",
    "_ low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) we detected resonance absorption lines from h- and he - like oxygen in the x - ray spectra of background quasars , namely pks  2155 - 304 and 3c  273 .",
    "the detected lines can be categorized into ( 1 ) those at @xmath4 and ( 2 ) one redshifted intervening system . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss these detections and their implications for the physical properties of the hot gases that give rise to these absorption features .",
    "pks  2155 - 304 and 3c  273 are bright extragalactic x - ray sources used as _",
    "chandra _ calibration targets .",
    "they were observed with the _ chandra _ letg - acis ( the observations ids for pks  2155 are 1703 , 2335 , 3168 ; and the ids for 3c  273 are 1198 , 2464 , 2471 ) . for detailed data analysis , we refer to fang et al .",
    "we found all continua are well described by a single power law absorbed by galactic neutral hydrogen .",
    "after a blind search for any statistically significant absorption features , several absorption features with s / n  @xmath5  4 were detected in the spectra of both quasars in the 242   region of the letgs spectral bandpass ( figure  1 ) .",
    "these features were subsequently fit in isis ( houck & denicola  2000 ) .",
    "the absorption feature at @xmath6   was reported by nicastro et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in the letgs - hrc archival data .",
    "we concentrate on the absorption feature which appears at @xmath7 ( 619  ev ) . considering cosmic abundances and oscillator strengths for different ions ,",
    "ly@xmath0 is the only strong candidate line between 18 and 20   , the measured wavelength de - redshifted to the source .",
    "it is plausible that the 20    absorption is due to ly@xmath0 in a known intervening system at @xmath8 . with _",
    "shull et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovered a cluster of low metallicity ly@xmath0 clouds along the line - of - sight ( los ) towards pks  2155 - 304 , most of which have redshifts between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . using 21 cm images from the _ very large array _",
    "( _ vla _ ) , they detected a small group of four galaxies offset by @xmath11 kpc from the los , and suggested that the ly@xmath0 clouds could arise from gas associated with the group ( we use @xmath12 throughout the paper ) .",
    "taking the absorption line to be ly@xmath0 , we estimate the column density is @xmath13 if the line is unsaturated .",
    "we can constrain the density of the absorbing gas , assuming it is associated with the intervening galaxy group . since the line is unresolved , a lower limit of @xmath14",
    "can be obtained . here",
    "@xmath15 is the metallicity in units of 0.1 solar abundance , @xmath16 is the ionization fraction in units of 0.5 , and @xmath17 is the path length in units of @xmath18 .",
    "a more reasonable estimate of the path length comes from the mean projected separation of @xmath191 mpc for the galaxies in the group , which gives @xmath20 .",
    "this implies a range of baryon overdensity ( @xmath21 50 - 350 ) over the cosmic mean @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , shull et al.(1998 ) estimate an overdensity for the galaxy group of @xmath23100 .    in the case of pure collisional ionization",
    ", temperature is the only parameter of importance over a wide range of density so long as the gas is optically thin .",
    "the ionization fraction peaks at 0.5 , and exceeds 0.1 for temperatures @xmath24 k. using cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) we find that photoionzation by the cosmic uv / x - ray background is not important for @xmath25 .",
    "cloudy calculations of the column density ratios between other ions and also show that @xmath26 k.    assuming conservative upper limits of @xmath27 and an ionization fraction of @xmath28 , and a path length of @xmath29 , we estimate @xmath30 .",
    "this is about 10% of the total baryon fraction , or about 30 - 40% of the whim gas , if the whim gas contains about 30 - 40% of total baryonic matter .",
    "this baryon fraction is consistent with the prediction from perna & loeb  ( 1998 ) based on a simple analytic model .",
    "based on the detected line equivalent width ( @xmath31 ) and non - detection of local he@xmath32 line at @xmath33 , we estimate the column density @xmath34 if the line is unsaturated .",
    "the indicates the existence of the gas with high temperatures @xmath35 k. the extremely high temperatures imply that is unlikely to to be produced in the nearby interstellar medium ( ism ) , although we can not rule out the possibility of an origin from supernova remnants .",
    "it is more plausible that the he - like oxygen is produced in distant , hot halo gas , or even in the local group ( lg ) .    *",
    "3.2.1 local group origin ? * + we can constrain the density of the absorbing gas , assuming it is associated with the local group .",
    "the path length can be set equal to the distance to the boundary of the local group , where the gas begins to participate in the hubble flow .",
    "assuming a simple geometry for the local group , the path length is @xmath36 mpc ( see the following text ) . adopting the 90% lower limit of the column density , this gives @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the metallicity in units of 0.2 solar abundance , @xmath39 is the ionization fraction , and @xmath40 is the path length in units of 1 mpc .    assuming spherical symmetry and isothermality , a model characterizing the distribution of the local group gas is given by the standard @xmath32-model .",
    "we adopt a simplified geometry model of the lg , where the lg barycenter is located along the line connecting m31 and the milky way , at about 450 kpc away from our galaxy ( rasmussen & pedersen  2001 ) . at about @xmath41 kpc the gravitational contraction of the local group starts to dominate the hubble flow , and this was defined as the boundary of the local group ( courteau & van den bergh  1999 ) . based on this simple model",
    "we estimate the column density of by integrating the number density @xmath42 along this path length . we find a tight upper limit of local group temperature @xmath43 k",
    "; at temperatures higher than @xmath44 k , the ionization fraction drops quickly and starts to dominate .",
    "we also find that the temperature of the local group should be higher than @xmath45 k. to satisfy the observed column density we find that the gas distribution should have a rather flat core with @xmath46 kpc .",
    "* 3.2.2 hot halo gas ? * + strong absorption ( @xmath47 ) along the sight line towards 3c  273 was detected with _ fuse _ between -100 and + 100 @xmath48 ( sembach et al .",
    "this absorption probably occurs in the interstellar medium of the milky way disk and halo .",
    "absorption features of lower ionization species are also present at these velocities .",
    "absorption is also detected between + 100 and + 240 @xmath48 in the form of a broad , shallow absorption wing extending redward of the primary galactic absorption feature with @xmath49 .",
    "the absorption wing has been attributed to hot gas flowing out of the galactic disk as part of a `` galactic chimney '' or `` fountain '' in the loop iv and north polar spur regions of the sky .",
    "alternatively , the wing might be remnant tidal debris from interactions of the milky way and smaller local group galaxies ( sembach et al .",
    "it is possible to associate the _ chandra_-detected absorption with these highly ionized metals detected by _",
    "fuse_. here we discuss several scenarios :    _ ( 1 ) . the is related to the primary feature _ : in this case , @xmath50 , and @xmath51\\sim1.5 $ ] , assuming @xmath52 .",
    "this is within about a factor of 2 of the o  vii / o  vi ratio observed for the pks 2155 - 304 absorber and is consistent with the idea that the gas is radiatively cooling from a high temperature ( heckman et al .",
    "this possibility is appealing since the centroids of the o  vi and o  vii absorption features are similar ( @xmath53 versus @xmath54 ) , and the width of the resolved o  vi line ( fwhm @xmath19 100 @xmath55 ) is consistent with a broad o  vii feature .",
    "however , this possibility also has drawbacks that the predicted o  viii column density is too high and the amount of c  iv predicted is too low .    _ ( 2 ) .",
    "the is related to the wing _ : in this case , the o  vii is associated only with the o  vi absorption `` wing '' .",
    "this seems like a reasonable possibility . then @xmath56\\sim2.5 $ ] . in collisional ionization equilibrium",
    ", this would imply a temperature of @xmath57 k ( sutherland & dopita  1993 ) .",
