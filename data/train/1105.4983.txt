    "those belonging to the latter case present a much richer and subtler geometry , and their full description is still missing ; we refer the reader to the introduction of @xcite and the references given there for a recent account on this topic .",
    "so far , the only known example of a surface of general type with @xmath0 and @xmath15 was the one given in @xcite ; in that case , the albanese map is a generically finite quadruple cover of an abelian surface with a polarization of type @xmath16 .",

    "double _ cover .",
    "the results that we obtain are quite satisfactory , indeed we are not only able to show the existence of such _ new _ surfaces , but we also provide their complete classification , together with a detailed description of their moduli space .    before stating our results , let us introduce some notation .",

    "* proof of proposition 8.1.3 ) , the monodromy action of @xmath619 on @xmath596 is given by the matrix @xmath648 , so the induced action over a character @xmath649 is as follows : @xmath650 for instance we have @xmath651 hence the set @xmath652 is @xmath57-invariant ( and by using the matrices of type @xmath653 one checks that it is a single @xmath57-orbit , as expected ) .      *",

    "finally , both @xmath532 $ ] and @xmath533 $ ] are irreducible and generically smooth .    the first part of the statement follows immediately since the action of @xmath57 on the set of non - trivial characters @xmath685 has precisely two orbits , namely @xmath686 and @xmath654 ( proposition [ prop.monodromy ] ) .",

    "it is sufficient to check that the monodromy action of @xmath57 is transitive on the set @xmath699 this is a straightforward computation which can be carried out as the one in the proof of proposition [ prop.monodromy ] , so it is left to the reader",
