    "adiabatic raman photoassociation ( arpa ) of ultracold atoms was introduced @xcite as a practical way of producing ultracold diatomic molecules in their ground electronic and vib - rotational states . as illustrated in fig.[potentials ] , the method consists of photoassociating two colliding atoms by two ( `` dump '' and `` pump '' ) laser pulses that are mutually coherent and partially overlapping in space and time . as in three - level",
    "`` stimulated raman adiabatic passage '' ( stirap ) @xcite , one uses the `` counter - intuitive '' pulse ordering @xcite in which the `` dump '' pulse , connecting the final bound state to an intermediate excited bound state , precedes the `` pump '' pulse , connecting the continuum to the latter state . in this way one executes a smooth `` adiabatic passage '' from an ( ultracold atom - scattering ) continuum to deeply bound molecular states @xcite .",
    "the main problem with the above approach is the small `` franck - condon '' overlap factors between the intermediate bound state and the continuum .",
    "the introduction of a ( `` feshbach '' ) resonance which is expected to better overlap with the intermediate bound state can alleviate this problem @xcite . as we show below",
    ", a feshbach resonance also induces an important _ dynamic effect _ of prolonging the lifetime of the spatial region ( the `` franck - condon window '' ) in which photoassociation occurs . in this way",
    "a larger fraction of the atom pairs becomes available for photoassociation .",
    "this aspect has not been considered in previous works on photoassociation via feshbach resonances @xcite , where it was concluded that wide resonances are more effective in promoting photoassociation than narrow ones . while we agree with ref .",
    "@xcite concerning the outcome of a single pair collision , we differ in our conclusions regarding the ensemble averaged yields : based on our calculation of the number of recombining atoms per laser pulse - pair , we find that narrow resonances are in fact more effective than wide ones , because by prolonging the lifetime of the franck condon window , narrow resonances allow for more recombination events to occur .",
    "this mechanism more than compensates for the smaller energetic widths of the narrow resonances .     on an excited electronic potential .",
    "the latter is coupled by the `` dump '' laser to the deeply bound target state @xmath3 .",
    "* right panel : * the same as on the left panel , with the continuum - bound couplings modified due to presence of a feshbach resonance . ]",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ii we develop the working equations for the arpa process , based on representing the continuum as a discrete set of `` effective modes '' @xcite . in section iii we present calculations of the arpa population dynamics for a single pair of ultracold @xmath0rb atoms , and demonstrate how the fc window lifetime and spatial extent are being extended by the resonance . in section",
    "iv we compare the yield of arpa with that of magneto - association @xcite in which a pair of atoms in a feshbach resonance are transformed into a stable molecule by sweeping over an external magnetic field , thereby pushing the resonance energy to lie below the molecular dissociation limit .",
    "we show that the two schemes lead to similar scaling of molecular production yield , but that arpa is expected to be more efficient .",
    "finally in the appendix we show that the action of the pulses is tantamount to a quantum projective measurements on the initial continuum wave packet @xcite .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section v.",
    "as illustrated in fig.[potentials ] , arpa involves a @xmath4-type level structure , similar to 3-state stirap , in which two , mutually coherent , temporally and spatially overlapping , laser pulses induce adiabatic passage from a molecular continuum ( representing two colliding atoms ) to the target bound level @xmath5 using an excited bound state @xmath6 as an intermediate .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is written as ( in atomic units ) , @xmath7 is the `` material '' hamiltonian .",
    "the bandwidth of the pulses ranges from being of order of 100@xmath2k , down to tens of nk , which , when compared to the vibrational energy separation , makes it valid to include no other bound states than @xmath3 and @xmath8 . the second term in eq.([hfull ] )",
    "describes the interaction of @xmath9 the transition dipole moment , with the `` dump '' ( @xmath10 ) and `` pump '' ( @xmath11 ) laser pulses , whose respective amplitudes and central frequencies are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we tune @xmath14 , the pump center frequency , to be in near resonance with @xmath15 the transition frequency between the intermediate state @xmath8 and the continuum states @xmath16 ; and @xmath17 the dump center frequency , to be in resonance with @xmath18 the intermediate - to - final - state transition frequency .",
    "we assume that the laser fields do not vary significantly over the range of atom - atom distances in which photoassociation occurs , thereby justifying the elimination of the spatial variation of the fields .    as state @xmath3",
    "we choose a deeply bound rovibrational level belonging to the ground electronic potential . given this choice , the intermediate state @xmath19 taken to belong to an excited electronic potential , is chosen to be a vibrational state that overlaps well with the @xmath3 state .",

    "[ efficiency ] top panel , where the transfer yield is plotted as a function of the resonance width , we see that the transfer yield is not greatly affected at ensemble temperatures of a few @xmath2k to a few @xmath148k .",
    "as the ensemble temperature goes down by three orders of magnitude , the single collision transfer efficiency goes down too , by @xmath149 of its original value .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for narrower resonances , because the longer interaction times enhance the effect of the spontaneous decay .",
    "however , as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ freedecay ] , it is possible to combat the effect of spontaneous decay at very low temperatures , e.g. in nk range , by increasing the amplitude ( intensity ) of both laser fields .",
    "one can summarize these results by saying that the optimal resonance width is always @xmath150 of the ensemble temperature , and that the optimal molecular production efficiency by arpa is @xmath151 higher than that of the wide resonance ( flat continuum ) case .      at long times the cumulative action of many pulses can change a region ( or regions ) in phase space corresponding to the recombining atoms , thereby affecting the initial wave packet amplitude @xmath152 however , an atomic ensemble can thermalize sufficiently fast , on the order of milliseconds , to yield the typical atomic trap setting of @xmath115k temperature and @xmath153/@xmath154 density @xcite .",
    "this means ( depending on the repetition rate of the pulses ) , that after a few thousand @xmath2s pulse - pairs , the atomic ensemble can thermalize back to its original phase - space distribution , re - validating the ensemble - averaged form we used for @xmath41 .    according to previous estimates @xcite , the total number of pulse pairs needed to transfer an entire atomic ensemble of density @xmath155@xmath154 is around of @xmath156 .",
    "therefore a few thousand pulses is indeed a very small fraction of total number of pulses needed , and the thermalization is fast comparing to the ensemble size molecular conversion time .",
    "one is also inclined to pose the practical question of how to hide the newly formed molecule in state @xmath3 from subsequent pulse pairs . in accordance with more detailed discussions in ref @xcite ,",
    "this can be done , for example , by allowing the newly formed molecules in state @xmath3 to  leak \" away from the laser focus , which is possible because they react differently from the atoms to the confining laser frequency .",
    "a molecular trap can then be placed just below the atomic trap .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , we now present a detailed calculation of arpa efficiency in a thermal ensemble . in order to estimate the fraction of atoms photoassociated per pulse - pair ,",
    "we multiply @xmath157 , the single collision photoassociation probability at energy @xmath43 , by the number of collisions experienced by a given atom while the pulses are on .",
    "this is equivalent to averaging over all possible values of @xmath76 as performed above .",
    "the number of collisions during the pulses is calculated as follows : at a given energy @xmath43 , the velocity of a given atom is @xmath158 and the distance traversed by it during a pulse of @xmath159 duration is @xmath160 .",
    "the cross - section for collision is @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the impact parameter . for @xmath55-wave collisions ,",
    "the semiclassical estimate is @xmath163 .",
    "hence , the number of collisions experienced by the atom during the two pulses is @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the number of atoms in the trap , and @xmath166 is its volume . putting all this together we obtain that the fraction of atoms photoassociated per pulse - pair is @xmath167 estimating the photoassociation yield for the case of flat continuum , we can set @xmath168 @xcite , and assume that all collisions occur at the temperature of the relative motion @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "further , when optimizing the yield for an atomic ensemble , we must choose @xmath170 because the bandwidths of the pump and dump pulses should match the energy spread in the ensemble .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath171 as pointed out above , a narrow resonance can enhance this fraction by a factor of @xmath172 , i.e. , for a narrow resonance @xmath173 with @xmath174 given by eq .",

    "we now consider the yield of magneto - association . in this process",
    "a time - varying external magnetic field is  swept \" in magnitude , thereby moving @xmath175 the position of the feshbach resonance of interest , to lie below @xmath176 the onset of the continuum . in this way the feshbach resonance is stabilized to become a `` feshbach molecule '' @xcite .",
    "the magneto - association is then followed by a traditional 3-bound states stirap @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of this scheme is limited by the yield of the first step . in this step",
    "two atoms may form a molecule if prior to sweeping the magnetic field they are within , approximately , @xmath177 volume of phase space from each other @xcite .",

    "( [ payield ] ) and ( [ mayield ] ) we see that the arpa yield scales with temperature in exactly the same fashion as the magneto - association yield . however , in absolute numbers our estimates are that at low to moderate phase space densities the arpa yield is @xmath181 times higher than the magneto - association yield .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that an experimental investigation of arpa at sub-@xmath2k temperatures is warranted .",
    "in this paper we have shown that adiabatic raman photoassociation of ultracold atoms proceeding via collisional resonances is an efficient way of producing ultracold diatomic molecules in deeply bound states .",
    "we have done that by replacing the resonance - dominated molecular continuum by a discrete set of `` effective modes '' acting like a set of resonances .",
    "though when the scattering resonance width is narrow it covers a smaller region in phase space ( relative to the case of wide resonances ) , resulting in a drop of the single collision transfer efficiency , this drop is amply compensated for by the ( as much as an order of magnitude ) longer durations at which the photoassociating pulses can effectively act . in this way",

    "we extend the treatment to a resonance - dominated continuum , and relate the effect of collision resonances with our ability to control @xmath184 .",

    "in the main part of the paper we have shown that resonance dominated arpa is most efficient when the resonance is narrow and the pump pulse has a narrow bandwidth relative to the initial ensemble temperature .",

    "in contrast , a narrow resonance can cause the system to be greatly delayed in the fc window . in that case",
