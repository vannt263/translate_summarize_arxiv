    "a comparison of qcd theoretical results with experimental data is often based on the concept of quark - hadron duality , which establishes a bridge between quarks and gluons , a language of theoreticians , and real measurements with hadrons performed by experimentalists .",
    "the idea of quark - hadron duality was formulated in the paper by poggio , quinn , and weinberg @xcite as follows : inclusive hadronic cross sections , once they are appropriately averaged over an energy interval , must approximately coincide with the corresponding quantities derived from the quark - gluon picture . for many physical quantities and functions",
    "the corresponding interval of integration involves an infrared region and in this case nonperturbative effects may play an important role in their description .",
    "in this paper we consider the following quantities and functions .    * the ratio of hadronic to leptonic @xmath0-decay widths in the vector channel : @xmath3 * the so - called `` light '' adler function , which is constructed from @xmath0-decay data @xcite : @xmath4 * the smeared @xmath2 function @xcite : @xmath5 * the hadronic contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( in the leading order in electromagnetic coupling constant ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vacuum polarization factor given by ( [ k(s)-integral ] ) below ; * and the strong interaction contribution to the running of the fine structure constant : @xmath8    a common feature of all these quantities and functions is that they are defined through the function @xmath9 , the normalized hadronic cross - section , integrated with some other functions . by definition ,",
    "all these quantities and functions include an infrared region as a part of the interval of integration and , therefore , they can not be directly calculated within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .    the method that we use here to describe the quantities and functions mentioned above",
    "is based on the analytic approach to qcd suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the analytic approach allows one to describe self - consistently the timelike region @xcite , which is represented in the integration in eqs .",
    "( [ r_tau - v])([delta - alpha - r ] ) .",
    "it incorporates the required analytic properties and leads to an integral representation for @xmath9 .",
    "we formulate a model that also incorporates a summation of threshold singularities @xcite and takes into account the nonperturbative character of the light quark masses .",
    "analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) @xcite is based on the analytic approach to qcd . in this approach ,",
    "in contrast to the behavior of the perturbative running coupling , the euclidean analytic coupling has no unphysical singularities . the ghost pole and corresponding branch points , which appear in higher orders , are absent .",
    "apt preserves the correct analytic properties of such important objects as the two - point correlation function and also provides a well - defined algorithm for calculating higher - loop corrections @xcite . in apt , processes with typical spacelike and timelike momenta are described self - consistently @xcite and , for example , inclusive @xmath0-decay can be described equivalently either in terms of minkowskian or euclidean variables @xcite . in the framework of apt , the theoretical ambiguity associated with the choice of renormalization scheme is dramatically reduced .    in the apt scheme",
    "the qcd contributions @xmath10 and @xmath11 to the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , are expressed in terms of the effective spectral function @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath15 the apt spectral function @xmath14 is defined as the imaginary part of the perturbative function @xmath16 and in the third order can be written in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the coefficients of the perturbative expansion of the @xmath1-function .",
    "the function @xmath21 defines the analytic spacelike , @xmath22 , and timelike , @xmath23 , running couplings as follows @xmath24 as has been argued from general principles in  @xcite , the behavior of these couplings can not be the same , i.e. , they can not be symmetrical in the spacelike and timelike domains , @xmath25 .",
    "the analytic and perturbative couplings have been compared in  @xcite . in analyzing hadronic processes with characteristic spacelike and timelike momenta ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account this lack of symmetry between the behavior of the running coupling in the euclidean and minkowskian regions .",
    "the analytic running coupling has no unphysical singularities and possesses the correct analytic properties , arising from klln - lehmann analyticity reflecting the general principles of the theory .",

    "both the couplings ( [ a_t - a_s ] ) have the same infrared fixed point @xmath30 .",
    "this value is defined by the leading contribution ( [ a1 ] ) and is not altered by higher - order corrections .",
    "the regular behavior in the infrared region of @xmath31 is provided by the power term in ( [ a1 ] ) which is invisible in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the reason for the regularity of the coupling @xmath32 is connected with the summation of the so - called @xmath33-terms that play an important role in analyzing various hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "in describing a charged particle - antiparticle system near threshold , it is well known from qed that the so - called coulomb resummation factor plays an important role .",
    "this resummation , performed on the basis of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential @xmath34 , leads to the sommerfeld - sakharov @xmath35-factor  @xcite . in the threshold region",
    "one can not truncate the perturbative series and the @xmath35-factor should be taken into account in its entirety .",
    "the @xmath35-factor appears in the parametrization of the imaginary part of the quark current correlator , which can be approximated by the bethe - salpeter amplitude of the two charged particles , @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic replacement of this amplitude by the wave function , which obeys the schrdinger equation with the coulomb potential , leads to the appearance of the resummation factor in the parametrization of the @xmath9-function discussed above .    for a systematic relativistic analysis of quark - antiquark systems ,",
    "it is essential from the very beginning to have a relativistic generalization of the @xmath35-factor .",

    "reproduces both the expected nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits and corresponds to a qcd - like coulomb potential .",
    "here we consider the vector channel for which a threshold resummation @xmath35-factor for the s - wave states is used .",
    "for the axial - vector channel the @xmath45-factor is required .",
    "the corresponding relativistic factor has recently been found in  @xcite .    to incorporate the quark mass effects",
    "one usually uses the approximate expression proposed in @xcite above the quark - antiquark threshold @xmath46\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath47\\ , , \\quad v_f=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{4m_f^2}{s}}\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the function @xmath48 is taken in the schwinger approximation @xcite .",

    "besides this replacement , one has to modify the expression ( [ r - appr1 ] ) in such a way as to take into account summation of an arbitrary number of threshold singularities . including the threshold resummation factor ( [ s - factor - relativistic ] ) leads to the following modification of the expression ( [ r - appr1 ] )",

    "the mass function of the light quarks at small momentum looks like a plateau with a height approximately equal to the constituent mass , then with increasing momentum the mass function rapidly decreases and approaches the small current mass .",
    "this behavior can be understood by using the concept of the dynamical quark mass .",
