    "ngc4438 is a large peculiar spiral galaxy , with a disturbed stellar disc and an even more heavily disturbed interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "located near the centre of the virgo cluster , ngc4438 has undergone a violent collision with the nearby giant elliptical m86 @xcite , and may also be experiencing ongoing ram pressure stripping due to an interaction with the virgo intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "ngc4438 s nucleus has been classified as a particularly interesting liner ( low - ionisation nuclear emission - line region , * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra of liners are characterized by the presence of emission lines from atomic species of low ionisation state . by definition , liners are galaxies which host nuclei with emission - line ratios that satisfy the following criteria : [ o  iii]@xmath7@xmath8 , [ o  i]@xmath9@xmath10 , and [ n  ii]@xmath11@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "their emission line spectra are similar to those observed in narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) of gas in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "however , some liners have relatively powerful central black holes , and tend to have broader emission lines ( e.g. , ngc1052 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the most likely mechanism to explain the excitation in these objects is photoionization either from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or from a strong stellar continuum @xcite .",
    "agn photoionisation models fit both the low - ionisation spectra of liners and the high - ionisation spectra of the seyfert nlrs with similar nuclear emission , but different nebular conditions ( such as the electron density and the incident ionising luminosity ; see discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nucleus of ngc4438 lies at the root of a nuclear bubble , expanding to the north - west ( nw ) , which has been imaged in h@xmath13+[nii ] emission by @xcite .",
    "in contrast with other similar systems , it is not clear what is powering this bubble , since there is neither a strong starburst nor a strong agn in ngc4438 .",
    "for example , the galaxy ngc2782 posseses a central starburst ( extending over a radius @xmath14200  pc ) which provides the mechanical luminosity that drives its central winds @xcite .",
    "the seyfert galaxy ngc3079 harbours both a powerful agn and a circumnuclear starburst @xcite , while m82 s outflows are driven only by a nuclear starburst @xcite . moreover , there are many other objects powered by composite systems where a circumnuclear starburst coexists with a central low - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the seyfert 2 starburst galaxy ngc5135 , distinguishing both the agn ( unresolved ) and the starburst ( spatially extended over @xmath14200  pc ) .",
    "broad h@xmath13 emission in ngc4438 has been tentatively inferred by @xcite from the fitting of optical spectra .",
    "we have repeated the fitting of the h@xmath13 emission line profile on their data but with a smaller number of gaussian components than @xcite , obtaining similar results .",
    "[ fig : ha_nii ] shows that a broad , fwhm@xmath142050  , gaussian component is clearly present in the emission - line complex .",
    "this spectral feature is thought to be indicative of the presence of active nuclei harboring a broad emission - line region @xcite .",
    "near - ir ( near - infrared ) light can escape high opacity and dusty environments more easily than h@xmath13 photons can , making it possible to detect heavily obscured line - emitting regions .",
    "near - ir emission - lines ; such as [ feii ] 1.257  @xmath15 m and h@xmath0 2.122  @xmath15 m , are less sensitive to extinction than optical lines such as h@xmath13 .",
    "near - ir observations can provide better extinction estimates , and can yield new information on the intensity of a potentially obscured central agn or starburst",
    ".    results of a near - ir spectroscopic survey of liner galaxies carried out by @xcite , showed that the [ feii ] line ( @xmath16 at 1.257  @xmath15 m ) is the most commonly detected emission - line in liners ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "the h@xmath0 line ( @xmath17 at 2.122  @xmath15 m ) is also a common feature . on the other hand , the pa@xmath18 emission - line ( or hi 35 at 1.282  @xmath15 m ) , which is the strongest near - ir recombination line available at low redshift in agn and starburst galaxies ,",

    "the near - ir data ( @xmath42 ) were obtained from the surface brightness decomposition presented in section  [ pho ] .",
    "the agn component photometry is given in table  [ nucphot ] , and it was computed integrating the residual image over a circular aperture of radius 4.5  centred on the nucleus .    the thermal infrared ( @xmath43 ) photometry of the nuclear source was extracted over a 4.5  circular aperture in the timmi2 nb  11.9  @xmath15 m image ( see fig .",
    "[ timmi ] ) .",
    "the result was a mid - ir flux density of @xmath44  jy . instead of a compact nuclear source , fig .",
    "[ timmi ] shows that the thermal emission is spatially extended over 3.5 , which at the virgo distance corresponds to 270  pc .",
    "thus , the nucleus and a circumnuclear dusty arc dominate the mid - ir continuum emission .",

    "data reported in table  4 of @xcite , without any absorption correction .",
    "the radio continumm ( @xmath47 ) data were obtained from @xcite .",
    "this measurement was computed by integrating the extended emission over a rectangle of sides @xmath48 .",
    "it gives @xmath49mjy .",
    "this value corresponds to an upper limit since the nucleus was not clearly detected , and it may contain emission from the nw and se outflows .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] shows the sed of ngc4438 .",
    "the solid line is a simple theoretical sed taken from @xcite , which is based on three parameters : a dusty torus with radius 125pc , an average visual extinction of 4 magnitudes and a compact source with bolometric luminosity @xmath50 , which does not represent ngc4438 s bolometric luminosity because of discrepancy between with the model in the x - ray region of the spectrum .",
    "the agn is modelled as a power law with monochromatic luminosity @xmath51 in the wavelength range from 10    to 2  @xmath15 m . the dust is composed of carbon and silicate grains with radii between 300 and 2400   , graphites of radius 10    and small and large pah components .",
    "[ fig : sed ] also shows a good match between both near - ir and visible data with the theoretical sed .",
    "however , this model is unable to fit the x - ray data .",
    "the sub - eddington x - ray emission @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the eddington luminosity for a black hole with mass 10@xmath54  ) in both , the soft and hard bands , suggests that the accretion flows are advection - dominated @xcite .      from uv observations",
    ", @xcite found that the star formation in the main body of ngc4438 is very weak , and is mainly composed of old stars , without signs of recent starbursts .",
    "our estimation of the visual extinction toward the nucleus of @xmath55 corresponds to an extinction of 3.3  mag at h@xmath13 @xcite , implying an extinction - corrected sfr of 0.08  yr@xmath38 for the nucleus . on the other hand ,",
    "the sfrs inferred from the extinction - corrected pa@xmath18 emission is 1  yr@xmath38 and corresponds to the circumnuclear region seen as an arc in fig .",
    "[ fig : bub]a .",
    "these two estimates correspond to upper limits since we do not know how much of the line emission arises from h ii regions near the nucleus .",
    "the velocity of the northwestern outflow can be estimated from the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extended]a .",
    "the width of the line contains contributions from both random motions and bulk velocity .",
    "the fwhm of the [ feii ] line at 3 4  from the nucleus , extracted from a 2  aperture is measured to be @xmath14350  while the mean [ feii ] velocity 2  from the nucleus ( at the bottom of distinc blob ) is closer to 500  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : extended ] ) .",
    "in fact , the mean velocity as a function of distance from the nucleus decreases from @xmath14500  at 2  to @xmath14350  at 2.5 .",
    "this seems consistent with an expanding bubble model since if the observed expansion velocity at the outer edge of the bubble corresponds to a lower line - of - sight velocity than at the middle of the bubble , due to projection effects .",
    "hence we adopt a speed of 500  as a reasonable value for the expansion velocity , which is a faster outflow than the one assumed by @xcite of 300  .",
    "this new estimate of the outflow velocity increments the kinetic energy by a factor of @xmath143 , yielding an injected kinetic energy into the halo of the galaxy of @xmath56  erg .",
    "this is a lower limit since only ionised gas is included in the calculation and we know that there is molecular gas also present in the nw bubble ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bub]b ) .",
    "the large amount of kinetic energy carried by the northwestern outflow along with the weak nuclear star formation , suggests that an agn central engine is responsible for much of the optical and near - ir line and continuum emission , and not a compact starburst @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared colours of the nucleus of ngc4438 mainly have contributions from : a bulge of late - type stars , a non - stellar nuclear source , re - radiation from hot dust , and reddening @xcite .",
    "we measured the colours of each surface brightness component in an aperture of 3 , in order to compare with other works ( there was no substantial variation using an aperture of @xmath57 ) .",
    "normal ( inactive ) spiral galaxies have colours of @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "the stellar colours of ngc4438 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , are clearly in the region occupied by normal spiral nuclei . as expected for liners and seyfert 1 galaxies ( see two - colour diagrams in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the non - stellar colour of ngc4438 is located in between the regions of agn and inactive galaxies , shifting the colours according to a reddened vector of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the near - ir stellar colours do not show evidence for starburst , in agreement with the uv observation of @xcite .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the relatively high sfr estimated from pa@xmath18 emission for the circumnuclear region ( see section  [ sec : pab ] ) , which would imply that this emission is not due to star formation but to the densest gas near the nucleus being photoionised by the central agn .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a more or less a constant fraction of a galaxy bulge mass ends up as a central massive object , either a stellar nucleus or a supermassive black hole .",
    "the evidence discussed in section  [ sec : co ] could suggest the presence of a black hole , although the radius of its sphere of influence @xmath63 0.1  is considerably smaller than our 0.74  resolution .",
    "@xcite found that there is a tight correlation between one of the fundamental properties of a galactic bulge , its velocity dispersion @xmath64 , with the mass of its supermassive black holes .",
    "independently , the same correlation was found by @xcite , in the same year . for ngc4438",
    "we have calculated the luminosity weighted velocity dispersion to be @xmath65  in the central 3 arcsec over the minor - axis , by using the kinematical data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] ) and by assuming an axial ratio @xmath66 ( see table  [ bestfit ] ) .",
    "the @xmath67-@xmath64 relation using this value yields a mass for the central black hole of @xmath68 .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that there is a fundamental correlation between the srsic index @xmath69 , which is a measure of the concentration within the bulge , and the black hole mass .",
    "the physical interpretation is that steeper and more concentrated bulges ( larger @xmath69 ) host more massive black holes .",
    "they found a @xmath70-@xmath69 log - quadratic relation using updated black hole masses and power - law indexes .",
    "this relation was computed from a sample of 27 galaxies with black hole mass determination from the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and virial bulge mass .",
    "the srsic indexes in @xcite were determined by performing a surface brightness decomposition similar to the one used in this work .",
    "the @xmath70-@xmath69 relation is as tight as the well known correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "we found a bulge well - represented by a srsic index @xmath71 .",
    "this index implies a black hole with mass @xmath72 for ngc4438 ( for the estimation in each broadband see column ( 16 ) of table  [ bestfit ] ) .",
    "the errors in the black hole mass were estimated using the intrinsic uncertainties in the @xcite relation .",
    "we did not estimate a black hole mass from the bulge parameters inferred from the @xmath73-band image , because the bulge is highly obscured by dust .",
    "another estimator of @xmath67 is the near - ir luminosity @xcite , which provides a @xmath74-@xmath75 relation tighter and less sensitive to extinction than those in the optical .",
    "column ( 15 ) of table  [ bestfit ] lists the computed black hole masses using the near - ir luminosity .",
    "it can be seen that these methods yield results in reasonable good agreement .",
    "in this paper we have presented a study of the nuclear source and central environment of the galaxy ngc4438 , based on the results of near - infrared isaac vlt / antu imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "the main results of this work are listed below .    1 .",
    "we have found extended [ feii ] emission coincident with the nw bubble seen in radio continuum , x - rays and optical emission .",
    "the morphological correlation between [ feii ] and previous radio observations , along with the absence of pa@xmath18 in our spectra of the nw bubble , suggest that shocks ( perhaps driven by a radio jet ) may be an important source of excitation of [ fe ii ] emission .",
    "2 .   based on our newly ( upwardly )",
    "revised estimated of the expansion velocity of the bubble , 500  , and the nuclear star formation rate estimated from its emission in h@xmath13 , which could be up to 0.08  yr@xmath38 , corrected by the nuclear extinction , we have addressed the question whether the outflow has an agn or a starburst origin .",
    "the large kinetic energy associated with the outflowing gas , @xmath7610@xmath77  erg , along with the weak star formation suggest that an agn is more likely to power the outflow .",
    "3 .   the h@xmath0 emission map shows strong molecular hydrogen emission around the nucleus which might indicate the presence of a molecular torus .",
    "our position - velocity maps showed that the gas emitting h@xmath0 is kinematically distinct from the gas radiating [ feii ] emission .",
    "moreover , the nuclear [ feii ] line ( fwhm @xmath14 415  ) is broader than the nuclear h@xmath0 emission ( fwhm @xmath14 270  ) , implying that the [ feii ] gas is kinematically more disturbed than the h@xmath0 gas . furthermore , the molecular gas seems to be more restricted to the galactic plane , while [ fe ii ] extends to higher latitudes from the plane of the galaxy .",
    "these results suggest that x - ray heating from a central agn may be responsible for the excitation of h@xmath0 .",
    "we have applied a two - dimensional surface brightness decomposition to the central 30 arcsec of ngc4438 . the best - fitted model consists of three components : a srsic bulge with power - law index @xmath78 and @xmath79 , an exponential disc with @xmath80 , and a compact nuclear source , resolved in _ hst _ with @xmath81 .",
    "the model was evaluated in a generalised elliptical surface with discy isophotes and an inclination angle of @xmath82 .",
    "we have constructed the spectral energy distribution of the nucleus of ngc4438 .",
    "it is in agreement with a theoretical sed of an agn obscured by 4  magnitudes , although the x - rays are underluminous by 6 orders of magnitude ( compared to the eddington luminosity for a 10@xmath54  black hole ) , which can be explained on the basis of advection - dominated accretion flows .",
    "we have derived co - band stellar line - of - sight kinematics along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion showed a strong peak on the centre of the galaxy of @xmath83  .",
    "a black hole mass of @xmath84 for the nuclear point source could be inferred from the bulge luminosity , the central velocity dispersion and the srsic index @xmath69 .",
    "we have carried out near - ir photometry of the nucleus , finding a point source unresolved by isaac at 0.8  resolution with and @xmath85 .",
    "this detection is further evidence that the central source is associated with an agn rather than a starburst engine",
    "we report the brightnesses and colours of the various components in the central region .",
    "the dereddened stellar colors ( bulge and disk ) in the nuclear region are typical of an inactive spiral galaxy , and show no evidence for a recent starburst .",
    "this is further evidence that significant star formation was not triggered in the recent collision with m86 .",

    "in this appendix we outline the procedures used in the data reduction process , which included bias subtraction , flat fielding , correction of detector defects , cosmic rays removal , and overlapping of the dithered frames .",
    "the detector has a jump between the two halves of the array , caused by imperfect removing of the zero level offset due to variations in the bias level ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) .",
    "_ flat fielding and bad pixels correction. _ the twilight flat field images provided by the observatory were sometimes affected by spurious large scale gradients ( specially in the @xmath86-band ) .",
    "this could be caused by bad ambient conditions , making non - linear effects important ( l. tacconi , private communication ) .",
    "we thus divided the flat field by a smooth approximation of the large scale variations .",
    "the smooth flat field was generated by taking the median of the detector image along the @xmath22-axis , excluding the outer @xmath87 columns , which generated a vector column representative of the large scale variation .",
    "_ sky and bias residual subtraction. _ this is the most important step in the reduction .",
    "the sky was obtained immediately after the last object image , pointing the telescope towards a blank region of the sky .",
    "the subtraction of the dark current was one of the most important problems to solve , because the dark current is known to be unstable in isaac @xcite .",
    "the bias level of the detector is a function of the detector integration time and its illumination .",
    "the bias level also varies in time , and is more pronounced where the readouts start ( i.e. , rows 1 , 2 , and rows 513 , 514 ) . due to this variation",
    "we did not apply the dark subtraction , which yielded images containing noticeable bias residuals .",
    "we removed these bias artifacts by performing a linear extrapolation along the array .",
    "the procedure was :    1 .   to isolate regions devoid of extended emission , 2 .",
    "then , to smooth the regions with a median filter and collapse them along the @xmath22-axis to obtain single bias residual columns , 3 .   finally , perform a linear interpolation between the collapsed columns to the entire detector array , generating a smooth bias image .    _",
    "dithering. _ the shifts in the dithered frames were obtained by maximizing the covariance between the images as a function of astrometric offset ( at a sub pixel level ) .    _ photometric calibration _",
    "we acquired a dedicated set of relatively faint standards from the ukirt telescope system @xcite , specifically the stars fs6 , fs20 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 filters ) and fs132 ( @xmath86 filter ) .",

    "the result was a @xmath92 per cent difference between 2mass photometry and our photometry of the standard stars named above , and differences of 12 , 14 and 10 per cent for @xmath93 , respectively for ngc4438 .",
