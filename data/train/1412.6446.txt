    "the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath12 ) interaction is a basic building block in nuclear physics as it makes it possible to describe nuclear structure and nuclear reactions .",
    "if the forces were known accurately and precisely , the nuclear many - body problem would become a large - scale computation where precision and accuracy are defined in terms of the preferred numerical method .",
    "however , the lack of direct knowledge of the forces among constituents at separation distances relevant for nuclear structure and reactions drastically changes the rules of the game .",
    "indeed , the use of a large but _ finite _ body of scattering data below a given maximal energy to provide constraints on the interaction transforms the whole setup into a statistical inference problem , based on the conventional least @xmath7-method .",
    "this fact was recognized already in 1957  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early review ) and , after many years , culminated in the admirable nijmegen partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of 1993  @xcite , based on the crucial observations that charge - dependent one - pion - exchange ( cd - ope ) , tiny but essential electromagnetic and relativistic effects , and a judicious selection of the scattering database could actually provide a satisfactory fit with @xmath13 for a total number of data consisting , as of 1993 , of 1787 @xmath5 and 2514 @xmath6 ( normalizations included ) at the @xmath14 level .",
    "these criteria have set the standard for pwa s and the design of high quality phenomenological potentials  @xcite .",
    "the inference point of view is mainly phenomenological and requires a balanced interplay between _ which _ data qualify as constraints and _ which _ models provide the most likely description of the data .",
    "none of these choices is free of prejudices and they are actually intertwined ; a circumstance that should be kept in mind when assessing the reliability and predictive power of the theory aiming at a faithful representation of the input data and their uncertainties .",
    "the quantum mechanical nature of the pwa with a given cutoff in energy leads to inverse scattering ambiguities which increase at short distances ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "remarkably , a universal and model - independent low - energy interaction arises when unobserved high energy components above the cutoff are explicitly integrated out of the hilbert space preserving the scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "while this @xmath15 framework is an extremely appealing setup based on wilsonian renormalization , to date this universal interaction has not been determined from data _ directly _ and one has to proceed via a fitted and bare @xmath12 interaction since off - shellness is required  @xcite . however , inferring a @xmath12 interaction from data , is not the full story , and three - nucleon , and possibly higher multi - nucleon , interactions are needed to describe residual contributions to nuclear binding energies  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , their strength and form are also affected by the _ chosen _ off - shell behavior of the @xmath12 interaction and a universal @xmath16 three - nucleon interaction remains to be found .    in an ideal situation",
    "all steps in the inference process , including the scattering data selection itself , should be carried out with the `` true '' theory , which for nuclear physics is quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "assuming , as we do , that the theory is correct , qcd would just tell us which experiments are right and which are wrong , or whether the reported uncertainties are realistic with a given confidence level on the side of the experiment . at the same time one would set constraints on the qcd parameters such as the light quark masses and @xmath17 , or equivalently the pion mass @xmath18 and the pion weak decay constant @xmath19 . while there has been impressive progress in bringing lattice qcd simulations for light quarks closer to nuclear physics working conditions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , we do not yet envisage , at least not in the near future , the realization of conditions that would allow one to establish , on qcd grounds , the correctness of the about 8000 currently available published @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data below pion production threshold . instead , already in the early 90 s the phenomenological analysis carried out by the nijmegen group made it possible to pin down the pion masses with a precision of 1 mev from their pwa of @xmath5 and @xmath6 data  @xcite .    in practice",
    ", we must content ourselves with an approximation scheme to the true theory in conjunction with a phenomenological approach .",
    "this specifically means assuming a sufficiently flexible parametrization of the interaction in terms of the relevant degrees of freedom which does not overlook some relevant physical feature . in what follows it",
    "is instructive to briefly review both the process and criteria taken into account to select a consistent database as well as the qcd - based theory used to describe it .",
    "our aim is to make the reader aware of all the fine details which are needed in order to credibly falsify the theoretical model , qcd grounded or not , against the data and keep an open mind about the out - coming result .    on the theoretical side",
    ", we will assume along with weinberg  @xcite that there is a chiral effective field theory ( @xmath20eft ) capable of systematically describing the strong interactions among nucleons , @xmath0-isobars , and pions , as well as the electroweak interactions of these hadrons with external ( electroweak ) fields .",
    "in the specific case of two nucleons , the requirements imposed by @xmath20eft can be incorporated into a non - relativistic quantum mechanical potential , constructed by a perturbative matching , order by order in the chiral expansion , between the on - shell scattering amplitude and the solution of the schrdinger equation ( see , for example , the review paper by machleidt and entem  @xcite ) .",
    "such a theory provides the most general scheme accommodating all possible interactions compatible with the relevant symmetries of qcd at low energies , in particular chiral symmetry . by its own nature",
    ", @xmath20eft needs to be organized within a given power counting scheme and the resulting chiral potentials can conveniently be separated into long- and short - distance contributions , the latter ( short - distance ones ) featuring the needed counter - terms for renormalization . at leading order in the chiral expansion one has the venerable one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential which , as already mentioned , emerges as a universal and indispensable long - distance feature for an accurate description of proton - proton and neutron - proton scattering data  @xcite .",
    "higher orders in the chiral expansion incorporate the two - pion - exchange ( tpe ) potential  @xcite , due to leading and sub - leading @xmath21 couplings ( the sub - leading couplings @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 can consistently be obtained from low energy @xmath21 scattering data ) .",
    "the inclusion of tpe allows one to reduce the short - range cutoff separating long- and short - distance contributions , which helps in reducing the impact of details in the unknown short - distance behavior of the potentials .",
    "nonetheless , we will note in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] that uncertainties are dominated by this diffuse separation between short and long distances .",
    "there are many practical advantages deriving from a @xmath20eft that explicitly includes @xmath0-isobar degrees of freedom , the most immediate one being a numerical consistency between the values of the low - energy constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 inferred from either @xmath21 or @xmath12 scattering .",
    "such a theory also naturally leads to three - nucleon forces induced by tpe with excitation of an intermediate @xmath0 ( the fujita - miyazawa three - nucleon force ) as well as to two - nucleon electroweak currents ( see for example ref .",
    "in addition , there are rather strong indications from phenomenology that @xmath0 isobars play an important role in nuclear structure and reactions .",
    "an illustration of this are the three - nucleon forces involving excitation of intermediate @xmath0 s , needed to reproduce the observed energy spectra and level ordering of low - lying states in s- and p - shell nuclei or the correct spin - orbit splitting of p - wave resonances in low - energy @xmath25-@xmath26 scattering ( for a review , see ref .",
    "another illustration is the relevance of electroweak @xmath27-to-@xmath0 transition currents in radiative and weak capture processes involving few - nucleon systems  @xcite , specifically the radiative captures of thermal neutrons on deuteron and @xmath28he  @xcite or the weak capture of protons on @xmath28he ( the so - called @xmath29 process )  @xcite .",
    "it is for these reasons that in the present work we construct a minimally non - local coordinate space chiral potential , that includes @xmath0 intermediate states in its tpe component  it is described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : pots ] .",
    "such a coordinate - space representation offers many computational advantages for _ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear structure and reactions , in particular for the type of quantum monte carlo calculations of s- and p - shell nuclei very recently reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the experimental side ,",
    "there are currently @xmath30 published @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data below pion production threshold corresponding to 24 different scattering observables , including differential cross sections , spin asymmetries , and total cross sections  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for updated @xmath5 and @xmath6 abundance plots in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "however , not all of these data are mutually compatible and a decision has to be made as to which are more likely to be correct . in principle , the @xmath12 scattering amplitude can be determined uniquely , provided a complete set of experiments is given  a rare situation for the case under consideration .",
    "therefore , a theoretical _ model _ is needed to provide a smooth energy dependence which allows one to interpolate between different energy values , and helps in deciding on the mutual consistency of _ nearby _ data in @xmath31 plane .",
    "the pwa carried out in granada parametrizes  @xcite  the interaction , for inter - nucleon distances @xmath32 less than 3 fm , in terms of a set equidistant delta - shells separated by @xmath33 fm ( in other words , a coarse - grained parametrization ) , while retaining only the ope component for @xmath34 fm .",
    "the choice of @xmath35 corresponds to the shortest de broglie wavelength at about pion production threshold , and consequently all the data are weighted with their quoted experimental uncertainty .",
    "the result of the analysis has been a @xmath36 self - consistent database comprising a total of 6713 @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data .",
    "more details on the data analysis specific to our potential are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "one important aspect of the granada pwa is the correlation pattern among the fitting parameters , namely different partial waves are mostly uncorrelated which , together with the large number of selected data , speaks in favor of a lack of bias in the selection process .",
    "actually the correlation length which decides on the specific form of the potential should be smaller than the distance @xmath37 fm in the coarse - grained parametrization .",
    "chiral potentials have been subjected to pwa and confronted to @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data up to lab energy of 350 mev . within the @xmath20eft framework the nijmegen group used the tpe potential  @xcite to carry out @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath38  @xcite analyses determining the chiral constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 from these data while constraining @xmath22 from @xmath21 data .",
    "taking the chiral constants from @xmath21 analyses , entem and machleidt  @xcite used a next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n3lo or @xmath4 , @xmath2 generically specifying the low momentum scale ) chiral potential to fit @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data up to lab energy of 290 mev .",
    "the resulting @xmath7/datum were 1.1 for 2402 @xmath6 data and 1.50 for 2057 @xmath5 data , and consequently a global @xmath7/datum of 1.28 .",
    "the chiral tpe potential  @xcite was also used within the coarse grained framework to determine the chiral constants in ref .",
    "@xcite with a global @xmath7/datum of 1.07 , based on 6713 @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data .",
    "other available chiral potentials  @xcite have not been confronted to scattering data directly but rather to phase shifts obtained in the nijmegen analysis ( the recent upgrade  @xcite of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the same procedure , while in ref .",
    "@xcite a study of peripheral phase shifts is carried out with two- and three - pion exchange potentials up to order @xmath39 ) . as we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , there is a substantial difference between fitting scattering data and fitting phase shifts mainly because of the existing correlations among the many partial waves and mixing angles .",
    "actually , a good @xmath7-fit to phase shifts may yield quite a bad @xmath7 in a fit to data .",
    "moreover , the spread in phase - shift values among different high - quality potentials fitting the same data reflects the differences in the potential representation and turns out to be _ larger _ than the estimated statistical errors ( compare fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite with fig .  3 of ref .",
    "the consequences of these larger errors have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the previous comments address the use of chiral potentials to fit _ selected _ @xmath12 scattering databases which have been obtained from _",
    "phenomenological _ representations of the interactions .",
    "an obvious question which comes to mind is whether chiral potentials , being credible and general low energy representations of qcd in the @xmath12 sector , should be used themselves to _ select _ the database . within the coarse grained framework",
    "the impact of chiral interactions on the selection of the database has also been studied in ref .",
    "the result was that a larger number of data were rejected but at the same time the number of parameters was reduced .",
    "this poses the interesting question on _ what _ is the meaning of improvement  a particularly critical issue when the potential itself ( chiral or not ) must be tested against the selected data .",
    "obviously an incorrect model will appear to be correct if a sufficiently large number of data is discarded .",
    "however , the theory with just delta - shells+ope is more general than that with delta - shells+(ope+tpe ) , and hence data selection based on the former is more reliable . in any case , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show also that the long range part of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( n2lo or @xmath1 ) chiral potential can indeed fit the delta - shells+ope selected data satisfactorily with a @xmath7/datum of 1.07 , when the potential is taken to be valid for inter - nucleon distances ranging from 1.8 fm outwards .",

    "the 34 lec s in the short - range potential have been constrained by fitting 5291 @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data ( including normalizations ) up to 300 mev lab energies , as assembled in the granada database , and the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath40 scattering lengths , and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "the global @xmath66/datum is 1.33 for the three different models we have investigated , each specified by a pair of ( coordinate - space ) cutoffs , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the long- and short - range parts : @xmath10 fm for model a , @xmath67 fm for model b , and @xmath11 fm for model c. these cutoffs are close to the @xmath68 fm tpe range .",
    "the values of the lec s corresponding to the three models are given in table  [ tab : table5 ] .",
    "they are generally of natural size , but for a few exceptions , most notably the lec s @xmath69 and @xmath70 multiplying the charge - dependent spin - orbit terms , which lead to relatively large splitting between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath28p@xmath71 and @xmath28p@xmath72 phase shifts ",
    "a splitting that is not consistent with that obtained in both the nijmegen and granada pwa s .",
    "it should also be noted that the degree of unnaturalness increases as the short - distance cutoffs are reduced .",
    "our results suggest that discrepancies between the phases calculated here and those from available pwa s in some of the partial waves , such as the @xmath73 mixing angle , could hardly be resolved by carrying out the database selection using the present interaction .",
    "we should also note that the renowned entem and machleidt n3lo fit up to @xmath74 mev provides a @xmath7/datum of 1.1 for 2402 @xmath6 data and 1.5 for 2057 @xmath5 , and hence a global @xmath7/datum of 1.3 . in our case",
    ", we describe 2161 ( 2764 ) scattering data and 148 ( 218 ) normalizations for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , which means that the average contribution to the @xmath7 from each additional datum is homogeneous and of order one out of about 800 extra data .",
    "so , our fit is as good as the one of entem and machleidt with these additional data .    according to our findings the largest uncertainty in the chiral theory when fitting up to a maximum lab energy of 300 mev",
    "is provided by the cutoff dependence . under these circumstances",
    "it makes little sense to analyze further uncertainties , but it is nonetheless surprising that precisely the model implementing many qcd motivated theoretical constraints should end up magnifying the uncertainty to a larger extent than the spread historically found in all so far successful pwa s to @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering data . on the other hand ,",
    "the reliability of the long distance chiral interaction does not depend on how the short distance unknown interaction is organized .",
    "this has been proven by the first chiral potential fits by the nijmegen group from their @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath38  @xcite analyses and more recently verified with increased statistics by the granada group  @xcite .",
    "this leaves open the possibility that better fits than those found here should be possible by properly altering the short distance structure .",
    "this point has recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , this cutoff uncertainty could be greatly reduced if the fitting energy range were to be lowered so as to ensure that differences between fitted data and fitting theory fulfill the normality requirement and , at the same time , statistical uncertainties remain at the same level as cutoff uncertainties . following the recent suggestion  @xcite , we find that this happens with the current form of the potential when @xmath75 mev . in a companion paper",
    "we will analyze the statistical properties of the present fit and how there is a trade - off of different uncertainty sources .",
    "we conclude by observing that , apart from the @xmath65-dependent terms , the potential constructed here has the same operator structure of the av18 , and is of slightly better quality than the av18 ( the av18 global @xmath66/datum on the same database up to 300 mev lab energies is 1.46 ) .",

    "<S> we construct a coordinate - space chiral potential , including @xmath0-isobar intermediate states in its two - pion - exchange component up to order @xmath1 ( @xmath2 denotes generically the low momentum scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the contact interactions entering at next - to - leading and next - to - next - to - next - to - leading orders ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ) are rearranged by fierz transformations to yield terms at most quadratic in the relative momentum operator of the two nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy constants multiplying these contact interactions are fitted to the 2013 granada database , consisting of 2309 @xmath5 and 2982 @xmath6 data ( including , respectively , 148 and 218 normalizations ) in the laboratory - energy range 0300 mev . for the total 5291 @xmath5 and @xmath6 data in this range , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a @xmath7/datum of roughly 1.3 for a set of three models characterized by long- and short - range cutoffs , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively , ranging from @xmath10 fm down to @xmath11 fm . the long - range ( short - range ) cutoff regularizes the one- and two - pion exchange ( contact ) part of the potential . </S>"
