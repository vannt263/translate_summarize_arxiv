    ", it is widely expected that a fundamental understanding of planck scale physics requires a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "it is well known that the standard perturbative quantisation programme faces problems , and a fully satisfactory quantum theory , even outside the framework of local quantum physics , is presently not at hand . in the past 15 years , however , a significant body of work has been devoted to re - evaluate the physics of the planck scale within conventional settings .",
    "much of this renewed interest is fueled by steven weinberg s seminal proposal , more than 30 years of age , that a quantum theory of gravitation may _ dynamically _ evade the virulent divergences encountered in standard perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this scenario , known as asymptotic safety , implies that gravity achieves a non - trivial ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point under its renormalisation group flow .",

    "while the effective coupling remains small for energies below the planck scale @xmath14 , it grows large in the planckian regime where an expansion in @xmath15 may become questionable . within the feynman diagrammatic approach",
    ", this behaviour translates into the ( with loop order ) increasing degree of divergence of perturbative diagrams involving gravitons @xcite .",
    "this structure is different from standard quantum field theories and relates to the classification of interactions as super - renormalisable , renormalisable , or ` dangerous ' , depending on whether their canonical mass dimension is positive , vanishing , or negative .",
    "the degree of divergences implied by the negative mass dimension of newton s coupling is mirrored in the perturbative non - renormalisability of einstein gravity which has been established at the one - loop level @xcite in the presence of matter fields , and at the two - loop level @xcite within pure gravity .    while this state of play looks discouraging from a field theory perspective , it does not rule out a quantum - field theoretical description of gravity altogether .",
    "there are a few indicators available to support this view .",
    "firstly , at low energies , a weak - coupling analysis of quantum gravity effects is possible within an effective theory approach @xcite , which operates an ultraviolet cutoff at the planck scale , see @xcite for a review . secondly , higher order derivative operators appear to stabilise perturbation theory @xcite . including all fourth order derivative operators it has been proven by k.  stelle that gravity is renormalisable to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this striking difference with einstein - hilbert gravity highlights the stabilising effect of higher derivative terms .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting theory is not compatible with standard notions of perturbative unitarity and has therefore not been considered as a candidate for a fundamental theory of gravity .",
    "the rle of higher order derivative operators has further been clarified in @xcite with the help of a brst analysis .",
    "interestingly , the theory remains unitary once all higher derivative operators are retained , whereas renormalisability is at best achieved in a very weak sense due to the required infinitely many counter terms .",
    "the renormalisation group ( rg ) comes into play when the running of couplings with energy is taken into account . as in any generic quantum field theory ,",
    "quantum fluctuations modify the strength of couplings . if the metric field remains the fundamental carrier of the gravitational force , the fluctuations of space - time itself should modify the gravitational interactions with energy or distance . for newton s coupling",

    "the uv behaviour of standard perturbation theory is significantly improved , provided that remains finite in the high - energy limit .",
    "this is the asymptotic safety scenario as advocated by s.  weinberg @xcite , see @xcite for extensive accounts of the scenario and @xcite for brief overviews .",
    "the intimate link between a fundamental definition of quantum field theory and renormalisation group fixed points has been stressed by k.  wilson some 40 years ago @xcite . for gravity ,",

    "this simple structure arises provided the underlying effective action is local in the metric field . from the rg equation one concludes that the gravitational coupling may display two types of fixed points .",
