    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are non - repeating , millisecond - duration , broadband , dispersed radio pulses that exhibit values of dispersion measure ( dm ) much larger than what is expected due to the galactic electron density.@xcite this latter fact _ prima facie _ leads to the inference that they are extragalactic in origin , with the millisecond - duration pulse - widths implying compact object progenitors .",
    "although a few galactic - origin hypotheses have been put forward ( see , for example , ref .  ) , most theories of frbs present cosmological explanations , including , for example , the collapse of supramassive neutron stars to black holes,@xcite and alfvn wings around planets orbiting extragalactic pulsars.@xcite only a few frbs are known , and all except one were discovered using the parkes telescope .",
    "the exception was discovered using the arecibo telescope.@xcite if frbs are indeed extragalactic in origin , they can be used as probes of the intergalactic environment , for example , to measure the intergalactic baryon content , helping solve the long - standing ` missing baryon problem ' in cosmology , wherein a discrepancy exists between the expected and observed quantities of baryons in the universe.@xcite however , due to the large uncertainty in localization of these bursts , a conclusive explanation of their origin is still lacking .",
    "recent efforts have focused on automated , realtime searches for frbs to try to increase the sample size,@xcite and , in case of detection , perform signal characterization.@xcite    we have recently designed , developed , and deployed one such realtime frb search pipeline for the 305-m diameter arecibo telescope . named ` alfaburst ' , it is a commensal data processing system that utilizes the 1.4  ghz seven - beam arecibo @xmath0-band feed array ( alfa ) receiver .",
    "alfa is arecibo s workhorse survey receiver , being used in the successful pulsar alfa ( palfa ) survey,@xcite that has so far resulted in the discovery of 145 pulsars , and one frb .",
    "alfaburst piggybacks on the commensal data processing infrastructure developed for the serendip  vi system , the latest iteration of the serendip series of seti spectrometers at arecibo .",

    "the down - converted radio frequency signal from the receiver is digitized using fast - sampling analog - to - digital converters at the input of the fpga boards and polyphase - channelized to 4096 channels .",
    "16-bit pseudo - stokes values  @xmath2 , @xmath3 , re(@xmath4 ) , and im(@xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fourier transforms of the two polarizations , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the respective complex conjugates  are then computed .",
    "the data is packetized and sent over 10-gigabit ethernet to the hpc cluster .",
    "the hpc cluster is made up of five server - class computers , one of which is the ` head node ' , and the remaining four are ` compute nodes ' .",
    "the head node monitors the receiver in use , and if alfa is enabled , runs the data acquisition programs on the compute nodes .",
    "the compute nodes are dual - socket , dual - gpu systems equipped with nvidia geforce gtx titan cards and raid data disks .",
    "each node , barring the last , runs two instances of the software pipeline , each instance handling a single alfa beam . the last compute node handles the seventh beam .",
    "the realtime pipeline first computes stokes values from the pseudo - stokes data , and the total power is used for downstream processing .",
    "an adaptive - thresholding rfi excision algorithm removes spurious noise and normalizes the data to have zero mean and uniform rms .",
