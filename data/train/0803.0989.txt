    "stochastic acceleration of ultrarelativistic particles via scatterings by magnetic inhomogeneities was the first process discussed in the context of generation of a power - law energy distribution of cosmic rays @xcite . because the characteristic acceleration timescale for a given velocity of magnetic inhomogeneities , say alfvn velocity @xmath7 , is @xmath8 , the stochastic particle acceleration is often referred as a ` 2nd - order fermi process ' . for commonly occuring non - relativistic turbulence , @xmath9 , turbulent acceleration mechanism",
    "is often deemed less efficient when compared to acceleration by shocks where the rate of momentum change @xmath10 ( hence the name 1st - order fermi process ) . however , here one also needs repeated crossing of the shock front by the particles which can come about via scattering by turbulence upstream and downstream of the shock .",
    "thus , again the acceleration rate or timescale is determined by the scattering time scale .",
    "for nonrelativistic turbulence @xmath11 , relativistic particles @xmath12 , and high-@xmath13 or weakly magnetized plasma , this time is shorter than the stochastic acceleration time , which may not be the case in many astrophisical plasmas .",
    "we note that in a relativistic regime , for example , 1st - order fermi process encounters several difficulties in accelerating particles to high energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while at the same time stochastic particle energization may play a major role , since velocities of the turbulent modes may be high , @xmath14 . and indeed , 2nd - order fermi processes were being discussed in the context of different astrophysical sources of high energy radiation and particles , such as accretion discs ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or extragalactic large - scale jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note , that although turbulent acceleration is often a process of choice in modeling high energy emission in different objects , and in fact there may be some other yet much less understood mechanisms responsible for generation of such ( like magnetic reconnection ) , evidences for the distributed ( or _ in situ _ ) acceleration process taking place in several astrophysical systems are strong ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it was pointed out by @xcite , that continuous ( stochastic ) acceleration of high energy electrons undergoing radiative energy losses tends to establish their ultrarelativistic maxwellian energy distribution , as long as particle escape from the acceleration site is inefficient .",
    "this analysis concerned a particular case of acceleration timescale independent on the electrons energy , and the dominant synchrotron - type energy losses .",
    "interestingly , very flat ( inverted ) electron spectra of the ultrarelativistic maxwellian - type  often approximated as a monoenergetic electron distribution  were discussed in the context of flat - spectrum radio emission observed from sgr a@xmath15 and several active galactic nuclei ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , it was proposed that such ` non - standard ' electron spectra can account for striking high - energy x - ray emission of large - scale jets observed by _",
    "satellite @xcite , or correlated x - ray and @xmath16-ray ( tev ) emission from several bl lac objects detected by the modern ground - base cherenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that narrow electron spectra , e.g. maxwellian distribution , can explain properties of extragalactic high brightness temperature radio sources @xcite , alleviating the difficulties associated with the anticipated by not observed inverse - compton catastrophe @xcite .",
    "motivated by these most recent observational and theoretical results , in this paper we investigate further some aspects of stochastic acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons by magnetic turbulence .",
    "in particular , we discuss steady - state energy spectra of particles undergoing momentum diffusion due to resonant interactions with turbulent mhd modes , taking rigorously into account direct _ in situ _ energy losses connected with different radiative cooling processes . as described in the next section  2",
    ", we use the quasilinear approximation for the wave - particle interactions , assuming a given power spectrum @xmath0 for magnetic turbulence within some finite range of turbulent wavevector @xmath17 , and consider turbulence spectral indexes in the range @xmath2 . in section ",
    "3 we provide steady - state solutions to the momentum diffusion equation corresponding to the case of no particle escape but different cooling and injection conditions . in section  4 some particular solutions are given corresponding to the case of a finite particle escape from the acceleration site . in section  5 we discuss in more details synchrotron and inverse - compton emission spectra of stochastically accelerated electrons , taking into account klein - nishina effects . final discussion and conclusions are presented in the last section  6 of the paper .",

    "this averaged field can be found , in principle , through the maxwell equations , and such an approach would lead to the exact description of the considered system .",
    "however , due to strongly non - linear character of the resulting equations ( and therefore substantial complexity of the problem ) , in most cases an approximate description is of interest . in the ` test particle approach ' , for example",

    "if the ratio of acceleration and energy losses timescales is independent of the electron energy , in other words , if @xmath477 , then the resulting particle spectra are of the form @xmath478 , where @xmath479 .",
    "finally , if the particle escape from the acceleration site is finite but still inefficient , a power - law tail @xmath480 may be present in the momentum range @xmath481 , again in addition to the modified maxwellian component . when the radiative losses timescale is not a simple power - law function of the electron energy , the emerging spectra may be of a more complex ( e.g. , concave ) form .",

    "let us define the critical synchrotron frequency of the electrons with the equilibrium lorentz factor @xmath482 , namely @xmath483 , and the critical dimensionless energy of the monochromatic ( @xmath484 ) soft photon field inverse - compton up - scattered ( in the thomson regime ) by the @xmath396 electrons , @xmath485 . with these",

    "thus , the high - energy synchrotron component drops much less rapidly than suggested by the emissivity of a single electron , and the emerging high - frequency tail of the synchrotron spectrum is of a smoothly curved shape .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to note that almost exactly this kind of curvature is observed at synchrotron x - ray frequencies in several bl lac objects @xcite , in particular those detected also at tev photon energies .    as for the inverse - compton emission of ultrarelativistic electrons characterized by the modified maxwellian energy distribution",

    "we also note , that the curvature of the high frequency segments of the synchrotron and inverse - compton spectra , event though being produced by the same energy electrons and in the thomson regime , are different .",
