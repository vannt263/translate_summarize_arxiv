    "as a canonical model of one - dimensional transport , the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) is a topic of current interest .",
    "one of the few solvable non - equilibrium models , the tasep and its solutions have been extensively investigated @xcite as a model for numerous one - dimensional transport processes including ribosome motion @xcite , pore transport @xcite , and traffic flow @xcite .",
    "the traditional tasep model consists of a finite lattice with open boundaries .",
    "particles are inserted into an empty site at the leftmost end of the lattice at a rate @xmath2 , and once in the lattice the particles move to the right at a rate @xmath3 .",
    "each motion of a particle within the lattice moves that particle exactly one lattice site to the right , and particles can move only if the site immediately to the right is not occupied by another particle . upon reaching the rightmost lattice site ,",
    "particles are removed from the lattice at a rate @xmath4 .",
    "exact solutions for the steady - state particle currents @xmath5 , and densities @xmath6 , are available through mean field approaches @xcite , matrix product methods @xcite , and recurrence relations @xcite .",
    "the latter two approaches solve the model completely , providing exact expressions for density correlation functions of arbitrary order . the tasep solution itself",
    "yields a phase diagram with three phases . at large values of the injection @xmath7 and extraction @xmath8 rates",
    "the system is dominated by the rate of particle hopping and is in a maximal current phase . at small values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the system is found in a low - density entry limited phase , and a high - density exit - limited phase respectively . within each of these two boundary - limited phases",
    "lie a pair of sub - phases each with a distinct density profile .",
    "the fundamental form of this phase diagram has proven to be very robust and extending the tasep to include particles that occlude more than one lattice site @xcite , or backwards particle motions @xcite , has not altered the phase diagram significantly .",
    "nonetheless , these extensions have facilitated the use of the tasep in modeling a wide variety of physical processes . in many phenomena of interest",
    "however , the assumption of a single internal hopping rate @xmath3 implicit in the normal tasep does not adequately capture the full character of the transport behavior .",
    "one system that has been the subject of intense interest is the kinesin motor protein and related molecules @xcite .",
    "kinesin , and kinesin - like molecules , form an integral part of the cellular transport system , shuttling protein - filled lipid vesicles to various parts of the cell . traveling along tubulin polymers ,",
    "the motion of the kinesin molecule is driven by a complex conformational change producing steps approximately @xmath9 nm in length @xcite .",
    "the exact stepping mechanism of the kinesin family of motor proteins is currently the subject of speculation , however one of the leading candidate models is the so - called `` inchworm '' model @xcite .",
    "the inchworm model proposes that a single @xmath9 nm step is composed of two sub - steps ; in the first sub - step one kinesin head group moves from its current position to the next available binding site on the tubulin filament .",
    "this sub - step is immediately followed by a dragging motion where the lagging head group is pulled up to essentially the same position as the lead group .",
    "lattice sites , the particle movement rate is @xmath1 . at all intervening sites , the movement rate is @xmath0 .",
    "all other aspects of the model are identical to those of the standard tasep.,width=288 ]    while tasep models have been successfully applied to model molecular motor dynamics in the past @xcite , applying the tasep to the two - part motion of the inchworm model requires that the tasep be extended . as the two sub - steps in the inchworm model are not expected to occur at the same rate we can expand the applicability of the tasep to these types of systems by introducing two internal hopping rates @xmath0 , and @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "[ dualrate ] ) into the tasep model .",
    "we assign these hopping rates to the lattice sites in an alternating fashion where odd indexed lattice sites move particles to the right with rate @xmath0 , while even indexed sites move particles with rate @xmath1 . using this arrangement",
    "a single @xmath10 unit would comprise , for example , a @xmath9 nm kinesin step with the @xmath0 step representing the movement of the lead head group , and the @xmath1 step the movement of the trailing group .",
    "generalizing this two - rate tasep model , we also consider the case where the @xmath1 sites are separated by an arbitrary number ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath0 sites . applying mean field methods",
    "we develop accurate approximations to the steady - state current and density of the dual - rate tasep in the maximal current phase , entry limited , and exit limited regimes .",
    "we also conjecture that , as was true with many previous extensions to the standard tasep , the dual - rate extension does not fundamentally alter the form the tasep phase diagram .",
    "the accuracy of our mean field methods are verified through extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "we begin by considering the dual - rate tasep in the limit of large @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "as is the case in the standard tasep , the dynamics of the system will be determined entirely by the internal movement rates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "ensuring continuity of the current in a lattice with @xmath11 @xmath0 sites between each @xmath1 site we find    @xmath12    in writing eqn ( [ smft1 ] ) we have assumed that the densities ( @xmath13 ) in the lattice have the same period ( @xmath14 ) as the movement rates in the lattice.$ ] , the average density at site @xmath15 in the steady state is defined as @xmath16 moreover , as the two - rate tasep preserves the particle - hole symmetry found in the standard tasep , we expect for a lattice of size @xmath17 that @xmath18 @xcite .",

    "we assume that at least one of @xmath2 or @xmath4 is less than the smaller of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we also assume the lattice is composed of a whole number of periods , so that the last lattice site is a @xmath1 site .",
    "focusing initially on the entry - limited case and applying the current continuity conditions we find , for arbitrary @xmath11    @xmath22    yielding the following densities and currents for the @xmath20 case :    @xmath23    similarly in the exit limited case we have    @xmath24    @xmath25    to determine the transitions between the maximal current and entry limited regions we equate the maximal current solutions generated by ( [ smft1 ] ) to the expressions for @xmath26 and @xmath27 in ( [ smft2 ] ) and ( [ smft3 ] ) to find the boundaries between the entry / exit limited and maximal current phases @xmath28 . for the @xmath29 case this yields    @xmath30    finally equating the the current expressions in equations ( [ smft2 ] ) and ( [ smft3 ] )",
    "we find that the transition between the entry and exit limited regions occurs when @xmath31 .",
    "while appealingly transparent , we will see in the next section that the results of the simple mean field approach do not provide a particularly good match to the results of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we attribute the poor performance of the simple mean field method to the method s failure to capture the correlations between the occupation probabilities of different lattice sites . to address this deficiency",
    "we apply two alternative mean field approaches .",
    "the first refined mean field , which we call the _ finite - segment _ method ( fsmft ) , involves exactly solving the master equation for a finite segment of the dual - rate tasep lattice in a self - consistent manner ( see appendix [ segmentsection ] ) .",
    "while primarily numerical in nature , this method can produce estimates for the current and density comparable to the results from mc simulations .",
    "the quality of the estimates produced by the fsmft approach is a function of the length of the finite - segment , with longer segments producing superior results .",
    "the second enhanced mean field method is an extension to the two hopping rate tasep of the well - known cluster mean field approach described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method tries to capture the occupancy correlation between adjacent sites by solving the exact master equation for the multi - site probabilities @xmath32 .",
    "as before @xmath33 refers to the instantaneous occupancy of site @xmath15 ( see appendix [ clustersection ] ) . as is typically the case ,",
    "the cluster mean - field method becomes increasingly unwieldy as the size of the cluster increases .",
    "the results for the @xmath29 case are    @xmath34    as expected , the solutions are invariant under the exchange @xmath35 , and regenerate the standard tasep results in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "we note that in the maximal current solution , @xmath37 as a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry in the model .",
    "finally , note that we can use these results to predict the location of the phase boundary between the maximal current and entry limited phases . using the results for the densities in the maximal current phase and applying current continuity at the entrance of the lattice",

    "while the correlation profile produced from the results of the mc simulations decays rapidly to zero , the results are not negligible for @xmath70 , and thus we expect these small longer range correlations to have some effect on the current and density of the two site tasep .",

    "as was observed in the mean field predictions for the steady state currents and densities , the boundary - limited 2-cluster mean field approach provides the best predictions at small values of @xmath59 , while the maximal current mean field method excels when @xmath73 .",

    "we have developed and presented four separate approximate methods to compute the the current and densities of totally asymmetric exclusions processes involving two internal hopping rates .",
    "moreover , we have extensively simulated the two - rate tasep and have thoroughly explored its phase diagram . we find that the dual - rate tasep retains the three phases found in the standard tasep model . within each of these phases the best of our mean field theories",

    "in particular , a maximal current phase 2-cluster mean field theory was developed that provides accurate estimates ( eqn . [ cluster6 ] ) for the current and the density ( figs .",
    "[ currents1],[density1 ] ) and the pair correlation function @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "[ correlation1 ] ) .",
    "similarly , in the boundary limited phases a simplified 2-cluster mf method was introduced ( eqn .",
    "[ alpha2 ] , [ beta2 ] ) , which produced accurate estimates for the boundary currents , and reasonably accurate estimates for the maximal currents ( fig .",

    "additionally , the finite - segment method shows promise as a means of producing accurate estimates for the current and the density of taseps with hopping rates that vary spatially in a manner more complex than the periodic pattern described in this paper .",
    "given the success of mean field theories in predicting the current and density in the standard tasep , as well as various extended taseps , the inability of our mean field approaches to provide exact results is noteworthy .",
    "comparison of our best mean field predictions of the density correlation function with the monte carlo results ( figs [ correlation1 ] , [ correlation2 ] ) indicate that while the 2-cluster mean field approach accurately captures the strong correlation between adjacent fast and slow lattice sites , the method does not account for the weaker , but still significant , longer range correlations .",
