    "the evaluation of the thermal average of physical quantities is one of the main aims in statistical mechanics .",

    "one inevitably has to give up this procedure in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an alternative approach for quantum systems is to diagonalize the hamiltonian , and to sum up the contributions from each eigenstate .",
    "this means to divide the problem into two parts : ( 1 ) diagonalize , and ( 2 ) sum up .",
    "again , both procedures become exponentially difficult with the increase of @xmath0 .    in this article",
    "we re - consider this problem for integrable quantum spin chains .",
    "we will show how the integrability helps bypassing the difficulties and yields exact estimates .",
    "the first problem , the diagonalization of the hamiltonian , can , in principle , be solved by the celebrated bethe ansatz .",
    "the second step , however , remains as a cliff wall .",
    "a first breakthrough , the string hypothesis approach , was achieved in the early 70 s @xcite . in this approach one",
    "introduces so - called root density functions of strings and holes of various lengths for the diagonalization .",
    "the free energy becomes a functional of these density functions , which is claimed to be exact near its minimum .",
    "therefore the variational estimate ( w.r.t . density functions ) , with a fixed energy of the system , yields the exact free energy .",
    "the string hypothesis formulation can be regarded as a micro - canonical approach .",
    "it is supported by many consistency tests .",
    "we conclude that within the string hypothesis approach the diagonalization is achieved , but the summation is cleverly avoided .    in order to evaluate thermal expectation values of operators ,",
    "it is better to deal with the canonical ensemble .",
    "we therefore consider an alternative approach based on the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm)@xcite .",
    "it utilizes an exact mapping between a 1d quantum system at finite temperatures and a 2d classical system . at first sight",

    "@xmath111    the two limits in ( [ freeenergypersite ] ) are exchangeable .",
    "we supplement an argument which claims that the second term in the second line in ( [ freeenergypersite ] ) is negligible for @xmath5 . the previous argument , using the inversion relation ( [ inversion ] ) can not be applied directly as the spectral parameter @xmath47 is already fixed as @xmath112 in the present problem .",

    "the analysis of the bethe ansatz equation associated to the qtm implies that @xmath123 for large @xmath124 .",

    "thus , at any finite temperature , the second term in ( [ freeenergypersite ] ) is negligible for @xmath5 .",
    "we then conclude that the formula ( [ formulaf ] ) is valid .",
    "although we made use of the integrability of the model in the above argument , the validity of the formula is actually independent of it .",
    "see the proof in reference@xcite .",
    "thanks to ( [ rttqtm ] ) , one can apply the machinery of the quantum inverse scattering method , devised originally for the diagonalization of @xmath126 , to the diagonalization of @xmath127 .",
    "we skip the derivation and present only results relevant for our subsequent discussion . ] .",
    "we fix @xmath46 for a while .",
    "then the eigenvalue of @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 the different sets of bethe roots @xmath129 correspond to the different eigenvalues .",
    "they satisfy the bethe ansatz equation ( bae ) , @xmath130 for the largest eigenvalue the number of roots @xmath131 equals @xmath132 .    to evaluate @xmath57 via ( [ formulaf ] ) we need the largest @xmath133 for @xmath56 .",
    "this means we must deal with infinitely many roots in the limit , which resembles the situation encountered in the evaluation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of a classical 2d model by means of the rtr transfer matrix .",
    "still , we would like to comment on the qualitative difference in the root distribution between such  standard \" case and the problem under discussion .",
    "[ baerootsfig ] shows the distribution of the positive half of bae roots for the largest eigenvalue of @xmath126 ( left ) and @xmath127 ( right ) for various system sizes .",
    "the distribution of rtr roots behaves smoothly for large system size .",
    "the limiting shape of the distribution ( the root density function ) is a smooth function satisfying a linear integral equation . for @xmath127 ,",
    "on the other hand , a few large roots remain isolated at almost the same positions as @xmath46 increases , while close to the origin more and more bethe roots cluster .",
    "let us describe this in detail . using the nlie technique",
    ", we can derive an approximate bae equation ( see the discussion after ( [ finitenlie ] ) ) , @xmath134 the hole @xmath135 corresponds to the branch cut integer @xmath136 , and this implies @xmath137 for @xmath138 , which was used in the last subsection .    near the origin , we set @xmath139 , and obtain the approximate distribution of @xmath140 as an algebraic function , @xmath141 this differs from the usual root density function which decays exponentially as @xmath142 . in the original variable ,",
    "if we take the trotter limit naively , @xmath143 namely the distribution of the bae roots for @xmath127 is singular in the trotter limit . we thus conclude that the usual root density method may not be applicable , and we have to devise a different tool .",
    "let us stress again that the cancellation of of the order of @xmath46 many terms in @xmath144 is a unique property of the qtm . in the rtr case",
    "@xmath145 many terms can survive , and we obtain intensive quantities ( e.g. , the free energy per site ) only after dividing by @xmath0 . on the other hand , @xmath144 is already an intensive quantity , as remarked after theorem [ suzukitheorem ] .",
    "the cancellation is thus vital .",
    "the @xmath146 terms , @xmath147 must be canceled by the denominator @xmath148 , resulting in @xmath149 quantities . according to this point of view , ( [ eigenvalue ] )",
    "is ( again ) not practical , as the ratios of @xmath146 terms are still present .",
    "thus , we understand ( [ eigenvalue ] ) still as a starting point , not as the goal .    one must intrinsically deal with a finite size system with coupling constant @xmath47 depending on the trotter size , and then take the trotter limit .",
    "such an attempt was executed first numerically@xcite by extrapolation in @xmath46 .",
    "the analytic low temperature expansion was performed@xcite based on the wiener - hopf method .",
    "below we shall present the most sophisticated approach which utilizes the commuting qtm in a most efficient manner@xcite .      the introduction of the new spectral parameter @xmath50 plays a fundamental role . instead of dealing with the bae roots directly , we make use of the analyticity of specially chosen auxiliary functions in the complex @xmath50 plane .    there are various approaches . one of them is to introduce the fusion hierarchy of the qtm , which contains the original @xmath127 as @xmath150 . in place of the bae one uses the functional relations among fusion transfer matrices , @xmath151 here @xmath152 is nothing but @xmath122 in the inversion relation ( [ inversionx ] ) , where the small term @xmath153 was neglected .",
    "as @xmath154 constitutes a commuting family , the same relation holds among the eigenvalues .",
    "we thus use the same symbol @xmath155 for the eigenvalue . after a change of variables , @xmath156",
    ", one can transform the algebraic equations into integral equations under certain assumptions on the analyticity of @xmath157 .",
    "the resultant equations coincide with the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations@xcite .",
    "the string hypothesis is thus replaced by an assumption on the analyticity of @xmath157 .",
    "the coupled set of equations may fix the values of @xmath158 . then",
    "@xmath159 yields the free energy per site @xmath57 .",
    "a technical problem in this approach is that we must deal with an infinite number of @xmath157 functions , which requires a truncation of the equations in an approximate manner .",
    "below we shall discuss another approach originally devised in the context of the evaluation of finite size corrections@xcite .",
    "we define the auxiliary function @xmath160 by the ratio of the two terms in @xmath161 ( [ eigenvalue ] ) , @xmath162 the suffix @xmath46 is introduced to recall that we are fixing @xmath46 finite here .",
    "the bae ( [ bae ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath163 we also note that @xmath164 by construction .",
    "we then adopt the following assumptions for the analytic properties of @xmath165 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "they are supported by numerical calculations .    1 .",
    "there are @xmath132 simple zeros of @xmath165 on the real axis .",
    "they coincide with the bae roots .",
    "there are additional zeros , sufficiently far away from the real axis , so that @xmath63 does not include them inside .",

    "we can thus take the trotter limit easily , with @xmath171 , and obtain the nlie in ( [ nlie ] ) ( for @xmath68 ) . to evaluate the free energy one has to first set @xmath115 , then take the trotter limit .",
    "or otherwise one meets a spurious divergence .",
    "then we obtain the expression for the free energy in theorem [ theoremf ] .",
    "one still needs to make an effort to achieve a high numerical accuracy , especially at very low temperatures .",
    "the introduction of another pair of auxiliary functions solves this problem .",
    "we define @xmath172 by @xmath173 , @xmath174 .",
    "numerically one finds that @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",

    "we understand that @xmath180 .",
    "note that the convolution terms bring only minor contributions as they are defined on those contours where the auxiliary functions are small .",

    "@xmath212 we obtain @xmath213 here @xmath214 denotes the largest eigenvalue state of the qtm , which is given by acting with @xmath215 operators on the vacuum . as any @xmath216 is represented by a qism operator , we reach an expression for dme purely in terms of qism operators without solving the inverse problem .    at the same time , the problem for @xmath205 is not so simple in view of the analyticity .",
    "we consider @xmath217 as a concrete example . after employing the standard qism algebra ,",
    "one obtains @xmath218 here @xmath219 denotes a bae root and @xmath190 is the auxiliary function .",
    "we introduced @xmath220 in order to deal with the ratio of inner products of wave functions .",
    "@xmath220 is characterized by a simple algebraic relation .",
    "note that the above algebraic expression is formally identical for @xmath202 and @xmath205 : one only has to replace @xmath219 and @xmath221 for @xmath202 by those for @xmath205 .    in the case @xmath202",
    "there are several simplifications .",
    "first , the auxiliary function is by construction trivial , @xmath222 .",
    "second , we can introduce the root density function in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "then the algebraic relation for @xmath223 is solved with the explicit result @xmath224 . @xmath225",
    "third , we can freely move the integration contours . every time it passes the singularity of @xmath226",
    ", it brings extra contributions and they cancel the  tails \" ( the 2nd to the 4th terms above ) .",
    "we finally obtain @xmath227 without such a compact expression , it is hard to proceed further .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath190 is quite non - trivial for @xmath205 .",
    "as noted previously , we can not resort to the root density function .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath220 in the trotter limit is thus unknown .",
    "the most significant difference is that the integration contour is already fixed for @xmath205 .",
    "thus , we can not apply the above trick to swallow tails into the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , with an appropriate choice of a further auxiliary function @xmath228 , it was shown that a compact multiple integral representation , similar to ( [ tzerod ] ) is also possible for @xmath205@xcite , @xmath229 the formula for any other dme is similarly known .",
    "it is a big progress to obtain the multiple integral representation for dmes .",
    "the representation is , however , not yet optimal .",
    "although one can use it for the numerical analysis at sufficiently high temperatures , it suffers from numerical inaccuracy at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "we thus would like to reduce it to ( a sum of ) products of single integrals .",
    "the factorization of dme at @xmath202 has been performed by brute force , with the extensive use of the shift of contour technique @xcite .",
    "based on studies of the @xmath203kz equation , a hidden grassmannian structure behind dme has been found@xcite .",
    "it naturally explains the factorization of the multiple integral formula through the nilpotency of operators .",
    "the explicit form of dme consists of two pieces , the algebraic part , evaluated from a matrix element of @xmath203-oscillators , and the transcendental part , related to the spinon-@xmath230 matrix .    on the other hand",
    ", we still do not have a finite temperature analogue of the @xmath203kz equation .",
    "we are nevertheless able to factorize the multiple integrals for small segments@xcite .",
    "the explicit results also consist of two parts .",
    "surprisingly the algebraic part remains identical to the @xmath202 case , while the transcendental part can be interpreted as a proper finite temperature analogue to the spinon-@xmath230 matrix .",
    "this finally enables us to perform an accurate numerical analysis of the correlation functions@xcite .",
