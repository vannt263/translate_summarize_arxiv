    "string theory is not yet a mathematically well - defined system . nonetheless , the components of this theory which have been pieced together so far suggest a framework in which quantum physics and general relativity are unified . in certain limits",

    "each 4d string vacuum solution gives rise to a low - energy physical theory in four dimensions which generally is a theory of gravity coupled to yang - mills theory with matter fields transforming under the yang - mills symmetry group .",
    "the vast landscape of possible four - dimensional string theory vacua presents a major challenge for physicists who hope to derive predictions for observable physics from string theory .",
    "string theorists have struggled with this problem since the early days of the subject , when it was realized that ten - dimensional string theory could be compactified to four dimensions on any calabi - yau threefold , giving a wide variety of low - energy theories .",
    "efforts to remove unphysical massless scalar fields associated with calabi - yau moduli , such as through inclusion of generalized magnetic fluxes , have sharpened the problem further by generating exponentially large ( or infinite ) classes of vacua associated with each calabi - yau geometry ( for a review of recent work in this direction see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . beyond the enormous range of string vacua which can be constructed using this and other known mechanisms",
    ", it may be that even larger classes of string vacua can be constructed using less well - understood non - geometric compactifications . despite the wide range of possible string vacuum constructions , the range of low - energy theories which exhibit no known quantum inconsistencies when coupled to gravity seems to be far vaster still .",

    ", the swampland for four dimensions appears to be very large , and we lack tools powerful enough to make strong global statements about the space of consistent quantum gravity theories .    in six space - time dimensions , however , a global understanding of the space of supersymmetric string vacua may be within reach . in @xmath0 dimensions , quantum anomalies can lead to a violation of diffeomorphism or yang - mills invariance .",
    "the condition that such anomalies are absent strongly constrains the range of possible quantum - consistent supergravity theories in six dimensions .",

    "we have proven that when the number of tensor multiplets is less than 9 , there are only a finite number of distinct gauge groups and matter representations which can appear in consistent low - energy theories @xcite .",

    "for example , there is such a family of models with gauge group @xmath176 .",
    "the other possibilities are described in @xcite . for @xmath27 , the models in all of these infinite families with unbounded factors are unacceptable because the gauge kinetic term for one of the factors is always unphysical .",

    "we briefly summarize here a few of these questions which are most closely related to the discussion in this paper .",
    "we have argued that the correspondence between the low - energy data associated with the anomaly cancellation conditions and the mathematical structure of f - theory leads to a map ( [ eq : map ] ) from the anomaly lattice @xmath6 to the second homology lattice of the f - theory base @xmath71 . in many cases",
    "this map associates with each nonabelian factor in the gauge group an effective divisor on @xmath71 . in order to show that the model can be realized in f - theory , however , it is necessary to construct an explicit weierstrass model with the desired singularity locus associated with these divisors . in many cases",
    "it seems that this can be done . for a class of models with @xmath28 and gauge group @xmath146",
    ", we showed in @xcite that there is a precise correspondence between the number of degrees of freedom needed to fix the desired singularity structures on the proper divisor locus and the number of degrees of freedom encoded in the scalar matter fields through @xmath302 .",
    "it may be possible to give a mathematical proof that the existence of a weierstrass model follows given some necessary topological conditions on the divisor locus .",
    "such a proof would be a useful step forward in identifying a large class of the anomaly - free models which have f - theory realizations .",
    "as mentioned above , while codimension one singularities in elliptic fibrations are well - understood , codimension two singularities arising at the intersection of codimension one singularities are not completely understood .",
    "such singularities give rise in f - theory compactifications to a variety of different representation structures for matter fields . in studying the set of anomaly - free supergravity theories in six dimensions ,",
    "we have encountered some novel matter representations which may or may not be associated with valid f - theory compactifications . for example , in @xcite , we found some models with an @xmath146 gauge group and matter in a four - index antisymmetric representation .",
    "while some f - theory constructions are known which give rise to three - index antisymmetric representations of @xmath146 @xcite there is as yet no understanding of a singularity structure which would give a four - index antisymmetric representation . a complete classification of codimension two singularities in elliptic fibrations of calabi - yau manifolds would be of great assistance in systematically understanding the set of allowed f - theory compactifications .",
    "it has been shown by gross @xcite that the number of distinct topological types of elliptically fibered calabi - yau threefolds is finite up to birational equivalence .",
    "finiteness of the set of topologically distinct elliptically - fibered calabi - yau threefolds is shown in @xcite using minimal surface theory and the fact that the weierstrass form for an elliptic fibration over a fixed base has a finite number of possible distinct singularity structures .",
    "these arguments , however , do not give a clear picture of how such compactifications can be systematically classified .",
    "a complete mathematical classification of elliptically fibered calabi - yau threefolds would be helpful in understanding the range of f - theory compactifications .",
    "the analogue of this question for four dimensions , while probably much more difficult , would be of even greater interest , since at this time we have very little handle on the scope of the space of four dimensional supergravity theories which can be realized through f - theory compactifications on calabi - yau fourfolds .",
    "some of the most difficult questions which need to be answered to prove or disprove the conjecture of string universality in six dimensions are essentially physical in nature . the key questions amount to      \\b ) can we identify new quantum consistency constraints on low - energy theories which constrain the space of allowed models to match more closely the set which can be realized through string compactifications ?    while a ) is certainly an important question , it seems that the most likely opportunity for narrowing the gap between the space of allowed theories and the space of string constructions is by identifying new constraints on low - energy theories .",
    "if string universality is even approximately correct , it is probably necessary to find a low - energy quantum consistency condition which rules out the infinite families of theories compatible with anomaly cancellation but which can not be realized in f - theory .",
    "one place to look for such constraints is in the set of conditions imposed by f - theory .",
    "considering the examples 3 - 5 in the previous section which can not be realized in f - theory , we can identify some possible constraints which may be needed in addition to anomaly cancellation and the gauge kinetic term sign constraint .",
    "it seems plausible that some of these constraints may in fact be needed for quantum consistency of any low - energy theory .",
    "we briefly mention here a few of these constraints , and make a few comments on how they may be realized .      as we see from example 3 , a necessary condition for a given low - energy theory to be realizable through f - theory is that the lattice @xmath6 associated with the anomaly cancellation constraints must be embeddable in a unimodular lattice . associated with any of the supersymmetric six dimensional gravity theories we are considering here , there is a lattice of dyonic strings charged under the anti - symmetric tensor fields of the theory , carrying a natural inner product of signature @xmath78 .",
    "some aspects of this lattice are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we do not know any reason why this lattice must be unimodular for quantum consistency , but it is possible that this may be necessary for unitary of the theory , or for some other consistency reason .",
    "note that an analogous unimodularity constraint follows from modular invariance for the heterotic fundamental string construction .",
    "demonstrating that the string dyonic lattice in a general 6d theory needs to be unimodular for a quantum theory to exist would help in ruling out some of the apparently consistent theories which we do not know how to realize in f - theory .",
    "as we noted in examples 4 and 5 , some apparently consistent theories can not be realized in f - theory because the topological data for the f - theory model realized through ( [ eq : map ] ) leads to certain divisors in f - theory not satisfying an effectiveness condition which is needed for the f - theory construction . in particular , the divisors @xmath303 associated with the vectors @xmath304 must all be effective ( inside the mori cone ) , as must the residual divisor locus @xmath225 associated with the vector @xmath305 .",
    "this condition has no obvious counterpart in the low - energy theory .",
    "it seems plausible , however , that some of these conditions may be associated with sign constraints in the low - energy theory analogous to the sign constraint on the gauge kinetic term .",
    "for example , a term proportional to @xmath306 must appear in the action of the theory by supersymmetry .",
    "arguments analogous to those in @xcite may suggest that this term must have a particular sign for consistency with causality in field theory .",
    "it is less clear how the condition on the residual divisor locus can be seen from the low - energy theory , but it seems possible that such a condition would arise from consistency with supersymmetry , since this is the ultimate origin of the kodaira / calabi - yau condition in f - theory .    to conclude , we have not yet proven or disproven the conjecture of string universality in six dimensions . simply pursuing this conjecture , however , has given new insights into the global structure of the space of 6d supergravity theories and string compactifications , and has suggested some intriguing avenues for future progress , both in physics , and in mathematics .",
