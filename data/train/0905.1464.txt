    "given a convex set @xmath3 in the plane , consider the problem of finding a second convex set that is as far as possible from @xmath3 in the sense of usual distances like the hausdorff distance or the @xmath4 distance , subject to two natural geometric constraints , _ viz .",
    "_ , that the two sets have the same perimeter and steiner point , without either of which conditions there are sets arbitrarily far away from @xmath3 .",
    "a plausible conjecture , which we prove below , is that the farthest convex set , subject to the two constraints , is always a `` needle , '' to use the colorful terminology of plya and szeg @xcite for a line segment in the plane .    in the case of the @xmath4 distance",
    ", the problem of the farthest convex set can be expressed as the maximization of a quadratic integral functional of the support function of the desired set , and , as we shall show , with the same two geometric constraints it is possible to characterize the maximizers of a wider class of such functionals as either triangles or needles , which , intuitively , can be considered as collapsed triangles .",
    "one of our inspirations for pursuing the wider class of functionals , the maximizers of which are triangles , is a recent article @xcite , in which the maximizers of another class of convex functionals were shown to be polygons .",
    "now , the maximizers of a convex functional must lie on the boundary of the feasible set , which is to say , in our case or that of @xcite , that the maximizers will be nonstrictly convex , but not simple polygons _ a priori_. what restrictions are needed on the functional to imply furthermore that the maximizer must be triangular ? in this article , we consider functionals that are expressible as integrals of quadratic expressions in the support function , and show that the maximizers are always generalized triangles , i.e. , triangles or needles .",
    "an advantage of describing shape - optimization problems through the support function @xmath2 is that it is easy to express many geometric features , including perimeter and area , in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "yet another tool that is available to in the case of functionals that are quadratic in @xmath2 is that of fourier series @xcite , because through the parseval relation it is possible to rewrite many such functionals as series with geometric properties accessible through the form of the coefficients . indeed",
    "another one of our inspirations was the analysis of the maximizers of the @xmath4 means of chord lengths of curves through fourier series found in @xcite .",
    "when the means with respect to arc length are replaced with means weighted by curvature , the problem falls within the category of quadratic functionals of @xmath2 considered in this article .",
    "interestingly , the cases of optimality of the weighted and unweighted problems are completely different .",
    "because additional analysis is possible for quadratic functionals when the coefficients in the equivalent series enjoy certain properties , we shall defer details on the chord problem to a future article @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we begin section [ sec2 ] with the main notation and general optimality conditions .",
    "we state our main result in subsection [ sec2.3 ] .",
    "next , section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the problem of finding the farthest convex set .",
    "we begin with an inequality involving the minimum and the maximum of the support function , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "then , we consider the case of the hausdorff distance and we finish with the case of the @xmath4 distance , for which our main result is essential .",
    "when convenient @xmath5 will be identified with the complex plane , and the dot product of two vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the unit circle , identified with @xmath10 . for @xmath11",
    ", we will denote by @xmath12 ( or more simply @xmath13 if not ambiguous ) the support function of the convex set @xmath1 ; we recall that by definition @xmath13 is the distance from the origin to the support line of @xmath1 having outward unit normal @xmath14 : @xmath15 it is known that the boundary of a planar convex set has at most a countable number of points of nondifferentiability .",
    "more precisely , the two directional derivatives of the function defining any portion of the boundary exist at every point and their difference is uniformly bounded .",
    "we refer to @xcite for this and other standard facts about convex regions .",
    "it follows from the regularity of the boundary that the support function @xmath2 belongs to the periodic sobolev space @xmath16 .    for a polygon @xmath1 with @xmath17 sides ,",
    "we let @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the lengths of the sides and the angles of the corresponding outer normals .",
    "the following characterization of the support function of such a polygon is classical and will be useful here :    with the above notation , the support function of the polygon @xmath1 satisfies @xmath20 where the derivative is to be understood in the sense of distributions and @xmath21 stands for a dirac measure at point @xmath22 .",
    ". can be proved by a direct calculation .",
    "it is a special case of a formula of weingarten , whereby for any support function @xmath23 of a convex set @xmath1 , @xmath24 is a nonnegative measure , which is interpreted as the ( generalized ) radius of curvature @xmath25 at the point of contact with the support line corresponding to @xmath26",
    ". we will denote by @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 if we want to emphasize the dependence on the convex set @xmath1 ) the support of this measure",
    ". it will be useful to recover the support function from the radius of curvature .",
    "this can be accomplished by solving the ordinary differential equation : @xmath29 for a @xmath30-periodic function @xmath13 subject to the conditions @xmath31 these orthogonality conditions are imposed because is in the second fredholm alternative and hence needs such conditions for uniqueness .",
    "they can always be arranged by a choice of the origin , _ viz .",
    "_ , that it is fixed at the steiner point @xmath32 .",
    "recall that the steiner point @xmath32 of a convex planar set @xmath1 is defined by @xmath33 by fredholm s condition for existence the function or measure @xmath34 on the right side of must satisfy the same orthogonality , that is , @xmath35 since these restrictions on the radius of curvature are necessary conditions in any case for the closure of the boundary curve of @xmath1 , they are automatically fulfilled .",
    "an explicit green function can be found to solve for @xmath2 in terms of @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath36 , in terms of which    @xmath37    the perimeter @xmath38 of the convex set can be easily calculated from @xmath23 : @xmath39    in this article , we work within the class of convex sets whose steiner point is at the origin and whose perimeter @xmath38 is fixed , at a value that can be chosen as @xmath40 without loss of generality : @xmath41 given that convexity is equivalent to the nonnegativity of the radius of curvature @xmath42 ( in the sense of measures ) , the geometric set @xmath43 can be described in analytic terms by requiring @xmath2 to lie in the function space : @xmath44    the class @xmath45 contains in particular `` needles , '' i.e. , line segments , which we regard as degenerate convex bodies in the sense that the perimeter of the segment is taken as twice its length .",
    "we shall let @xmath46 designate the segment @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "its support function is given by @xmath48 which satisfies @xmath49 .",
    "if the goal is to maximize a functional @xmath0 defined on the geometric class @xmath45 , and @xmath0 is expressible in terms of the support function @xmath2 , then we may equivalently consider the problem of determining @xmath50 we may then analytically determine the conditions for optimality of @xmath0 .",
    "the steiner point @xmath51 of a closed convex set always lies within the set , and in the case of a convex body ( a convex set of nonempty interior ) , @xmath51 is an interior point ; see , e.g. , ( 1.7.6 ) in @xcite .",
    "it follows that the support function of @xmath1 can vanish only if @xmath1 is a segment . for any convex body in @xmath45 , @xmath52 for all @xmath26 .",
    "we next derive the first and second order optimality conditions assuming that the optimal set is not a segment , following @xcite .",
    "[ theooptimcond ] if @xmath53 is a solution of ( [ 1.8 ] ) , where @xmath54 is @xmath55 , then there exist @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 moreover , if @xmath62 such that @xmath63 satisfies @xmath64 then @xmath65    the proof of the foregoing theorem is classical and can be achieved using standard first and second order optimality conditions in infinite dimension space as in @xcite ; we refer to @xcite for technical details .    if the optimal domain @xmath66 is a segment , then the optimality condition is more complicated to write , because the constraint @xmath67 needs to be taken into account .",
    "since it will not be needed here , we do not write the explicit form .      in this section , we are interested in quadratic functionals involving the support function and its first derivative .",
    "let @xmath0 be the functional defined by : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are nonnegative bounded functions of @xmath26 , one of them being positive almost everywhere on @xmath9 .",
    "the functions @xmath71 are assumed to be bounded .",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ theo2.1 ] every local maximizer of the functional @xmath0 defined in , within the class @xmath45 is either a line segment or a triangle .",
    "let @xmath1 be a local maximizer of the functional @xmath0 .",
    "we have to prove that the support @xmath28 of the measure @xmath72 contains no more than three points .",
    "we follow ideas contained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assume , for the purpose of a contradiction , that @xmath28 contains at least four points @xmath73 in @xmath74 .",
    "we solve the four differential equations @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the dirac measure at point @xmath77 and @xmath78 is chosen such that @xmath79 .",
    "note that equations have unique solutions since we avoid the first eigenvalue of the interval .",
    "we also extend each function @xmath80 by 0 outside @xmath81 .",
    "now we can always find four numbers @xmath82 , @xmath83 such that the three following conditions hold , where we denote by @xmath84 the function defined by @xmath85 : @xmath86 then the function @xmath84 solves @xmath87 globally on @xmath74 .",
    "now , we use the optimality conditions , for the function @xmath84 .",
    "we have @xmath88 therefore , @xmath84 is admissible for the second order optimality condition ( it is immediate to check that the two first conditions in are satisfied by choosing @xmath89 with @xmath90 large enough ) .",
    "since the functional @xmath0 is quadratic , however , this would imply @xmath91 which is impossible by the assumptions on @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the examples given in the next section may give the impression that the maximizers for such functionals are always segments .",
    "this is not the case . indeed , if we choose @xmath92 and @xmath70 a ( positive ) function equal to one in a @xmath93 neighborhood of @xmath94 and @xmath95 and very small elsewhere , the value for the equilateral triangle is of order @xmath96 while the value for the best segment is of order @xmath97 .",
    "there are many ways to define the distance between convex sets . among them",
    "we single out the classical hausdorff distance : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is defined by @xmath100 ( for a survey of possible metrics we refer to @xcite ; for a detailed study of the hausdorff distance see @xcite ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the hausdorff distance can also be defined using the support functions , as @xmath101 .",
    "moreover the support function allows a definition of the @xmath4 distance , introduced by mcclure and vitale in @xcite , by @xmath102 in @xcite , p. mcmullen was able to determine the _ diameter in the sense of the hausdorff distance _ of the class @xmath45 in any dimension .",
    "more precisely , he proved that all sets in @xmath45 are contained in the ball of radius @xmath103 centered at the origin . in terms of the support function , this means that , for any convex set @xmath1 in @xmath45 , the maximum of @xmath23 is at most @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) .",
    "we will need the following more precise result :      the first inequality in is due to mcmullen , who proved it in any dimension ; see theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "let us prove the second inequality . letting @xmath106 denote the unit ball , we introduce @xmath107 @xmath108 the function @xmath109 is convex with respect to the minkowski sum , which can be defined with the support function via @xmath110 in contrast , the function @xmath111 is concave , and as we are interested in the sum @xmath112 we can call upon no particular convexity property .",
    "the minimum of @xmath23 is attained at some point we call @xmath113 and the maximum at some point @xmath114 ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath115 the line containing the points @xmath116 and @xmath113 and by @xmath117 the reflection across @xmath115 . if we replace the convex set @xmath1 by @xmath118 , we keep the steiner point at the origin , we preserve the perimeter , and we decrease @xmath119 , because of convexity , without changing @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , to look for minimum of @xmath120 , we can restrict ourselves to convex sets symmetric with respect to the line @xmath115 passing through the point where @xmath23 attains its minimum .",
    "now , let @xmath121 be the segment in the class @xmath45 which is orthogonal to the line @xmath115 .",
    "we introduce the family of convex sets @xmath122 and study the behavior of @xmath123 .",
    "since the ball @xmath124 is included in @xmath125 and touches its boundary at @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , by convexity @xmath128 . therefore , since @xmath129 @xmath130 in particular , this imples that if @xmath131 , we would also have @xmath132 for @xmath133 near @xmath134 .",
    "thus , to prove the result it suffices to prove that a segment is a local minimizer for @xmath0 . without loss of generality , we consider the segment @xmath135 and perturbations respecting the symmetry with respect to the line @xmath136 .",
    "let us therefore consider a perturbation of the segment @xmath135 , replacing its `` radius of curvature '' @xmath137 by @xmath138\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is a non negative measure .",
    "since we can work in the class of symmetric convex sets , we may assume @xmath140 to be even .",
    "moreover , we have to assume that @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( the last relation @xmath143 is true by symmetry ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath144 now , the support function @xmath145 of the perturbed convex set can be obtained thanks to formulae : @xmath146 where @xmath147 denotes the green function .",
    "the function @xmath145 will have its maximum near @xmath103 , so to first order , @xmath148 in the same way , the minimum of @xmath145 will be attained near @xmath134 or near @xmath149 so to first order @xmath150 therefore , we have to prove that @xmath151 and @xmath152 let us prove for example ; the other inequality is similar . letting @xmath153 and using the fact that @xmath140 is even , @xmath154 \\varphi(\\tau)\\ , d\\tau\\,.\\ ] ] now , it is elementary to check that the function @xmath155 is always greater or equal to one ( see figure [ figure2 ] )      so we have @xmath156 . moreover , since the function @xmath157 is equal to one only for @xmath158 or @xmath149 , the inequality will be strict unless the support of @xmath140 is concentrated at the four points @xmath159 .",
    "this last case actually corresponds to a ( thin ) rectangle @xmath160\\times [ -\\pi/2+\\alpha,\\pi/2-\\alpha]$ ] for which a direct computation shows that @xmath161 and @xmath162 , and @xmath163 follows immediately .",
    "another consequence of mcmullen s result cited above is that the hausdorff distance between two sets in @xmath45 is always less or equal to @xmath103 , the upper bound being obtained by two orthogonal segments .    in this section , we want to deal with a similar question , namely to find the _",
    "farthest convex set _ in the class @xmath45 from a given convex set , as measured by either of the two distances defined above .",
    "more precisely , letting @xmath164 be a given convex set in the class @xmath45 , we wish to find the convex set @xmath165 such that @xmath166 where @xmath167 may stand either for @xmath168 or for @xmath169 .",
    "the lemma for any @xmath2 in @xmath172 , we have @xmath174 we now use the fact that the first eigenvalues of the problem @xmath175 are @xmath134 ( associated with the constant eigenfunction ) , @xmath176 ( of multiplicity @xmath177 associated with @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) , @xmath180 ( of multiplicity @xmath177 associated with @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) .",
    "thus , on @xmath45 we can write a minimizing formula : @xmath183 applying ( [ 2.11 ] ) to @xmath184 yields @xmath185 or @xmath186 combining with leads to @xmath187 and the result follows , once again applying and summing the two last inequalities .",
    "we return to the proof of theorem [ theoexist1 ] .",
    "let @xmath188 be a maximizing sequence of convex sets and @xmath189 be the corresponding support functions .",
    "since the perimeter of @xmath188 is uniformly bounded and the sets @xmath188 contain the origin , the blaschke selection theorem applies : there exists a subsequence , still denoted with the same index , which converges in the hausdorff sense to a convex set @xmath1 . according to lemma [ lemma1 ] , the support functions @xmath189 are bounded in @xmath16 , and consequently we may assume that the sequence converges uniformly to a function @xmath2 , which is necessarily the support function of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , since the distance @xmath167 has been assumed continuous for this kind of convergence , the existence of a maximizer follows .",
    "if @xmath164 is a given convex set in the class @xmath45 , then the convex set @xmath165 for which @xmath190 is a segment .",
    "more precisely , it is any segment orthogonal to the line @xmath191 where @xmath114 is any point at which @xmath192 is maximal",
    ".    let @xmath193 be the largest ball centered at @xmath116 and contained in @xmath164 and @xmath194 the smallest ball centered at o which contains @xmath164 .",
    "we denote by @xmath195 ( resp .",
    "@xmath196 ) the radius of @xmath193 ( resp .",
    "@xmath194 ) .",
    "let @xmath113 , resp .",
    "@xmath114 , be contact points of these balls with the boundary of @xmath164 ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we also denote by @xmath197 the segment ( centered at 0 ) containing @xmath113 and by @xmath198 the segment ( centered at 0 ) orthogonal to @xmath191 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath197 is optimal , among all segments @xmath121 , to maximize @xmath199 while @xmath198 is optimal to maximize @xmath200 .",
    "now , we are going to prove that , for any convex set @xmath1 in @xmath45 : @xmath201 for the first inequality , let us consider any point @xmath202 in @xmath1 . by construction of the ball @xmath193 : @xmath203 now , by the first inequality of theorem [ theoineqs ] , @xmath204 and the result follows taking the supremum in @xmath202 since @xmath205 .",
    "we prove now the second inequality in for any convex body @xmath1 ( the result is already clear for segments as mentioned above ) .",
    "since the steiner point lies in the interior , for any point @xmath206 @xmath207 therefore , taking the supremum in @xmath202 , @xmath208 .",
    "+ from it follows that for any set @xmath1 : @xmath209 now , we use the second inequality in theorem [ theoineqs ] , which can be written @xmath210 since , however , @xmath211 , we have @xmath212 which gives the desired result .        if @xmath164 is a given convex set in the class @xmath45 , then the convex set @xmath165 for which @xmath213 is a segment . more precisely , it is any segment @xmath214 with @xmath215 which maximizes the one variable function @xmath216 .    in the proof",
    "we denote by @xmath164 a fixed convex set in the class @xmath45 . an immediate consequence of theorem [ theo2.1 ] applied to the functional @xmath0 defined by @xmath217 is that the farthest convex set is either a triangle or a segment . thus , to prove the result ,",
    "we need to exclude the first possibility .",
    "let @xmath218 be a triangle that we assume to be a critical point for the functional @xmath219 .",
    "each triangle in the class @xmath45 will be uniquely characterized by its three angles @xmath220 such that @xmath221 is the normal vector to each side .",
    "the only restrictions we need to put on these angles are @xmath222 the lengths of the sides will be denoted by @xmath223 . according to the law of sines ,",
    "given that the perimeter of @xmath218 is @xmath40 , the three lengths are given by : @xmath224 note that the denominator @xmath225 can also be written @xmath226 .    if @xmath227 denote the vertices of the triangle , from the relation @xmath228 rotated by @xmath103 , we get @xmath229 the support function ( with the steiner point at the origin ) @xmath230 of the triangle @xmath218 can be calculated with the aid of formula using the fact that the radius of curvature of @xmath218 is given by @xmath231 , according to .",
