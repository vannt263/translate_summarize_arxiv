    "polling systems are a special class of queueing systems where a single server serves more than one queue .",
    "a certain amount of time is required to switch from one queue to the next . during this time the server does not serve any user and is considered idle .",
    "hence polling systems are non - work conserving queueing systems .",
    "a queue usually represents a location where users form a waiting line and wait to be served . in this case , the idle / switching time is the time required for the server to travel between these locations .",
    "various types of polling systems are studied in the literature .",
    "these systems usually differ in : the order in which queues are served , the service discipline for each queue or the number of queues ( etc ) .",
    "we will mention a few possible models .    a system with a finite number of queues",
    "is called a discrete polling system .",
    "this is the most studied model in the literature . in this paper",
    "we also consider arrivals that can occur anywhere in a continuum , as in @xcite .",
    "waiting lines are not formed for arrivals in a continuum , since the probability of observing two users waiting at the same point is zero if the arrival measure is continuous .",
    "we use the word `` queue '' to refer to any location where a user can wait for service , irrespective of whether or not a waiting line is formed .",
    "we first discuss the discrete models and then the models with two types of arrivals , which we call mixed systems .",
    "the queues are usually served in a deterministic cyclic order .",
    "they can also be served in a random order .",
    "the server usually moves in a fixed direction along a path .",
    "there are exceptions , for example in elevator polling the server reverses its direction after completing a cycle ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are various possible service disciplines , namely :    1 .",
    "_ globally gated service _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) : a global gate is closed for all the queues when the server reaches a given queue , say queue @xmath0 .",
    "the time between two successive visits to queue @xmath0 is called a cycle . only the users that arrived before the gate closure",
    "are served , as the server goes through the entire cycle .",
    "users that arrived after the gate closure are served during the next cycle .",
    "2 .   _ gated service _ ( e.g @xcite ) : there is one gate per queue .",
    "when the server reaches a queue , it closes the corresponding gate , and serves the users who arrived at that queue before the gate closure .",
    "the server then switches to the next queue .",
    "_ exhaustive service _ : ( e.g. , @xcite ) when it arrives at a queue , the server serves the users of this queue until it is empty .",
    "4 .   _ mixed service systems _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) : different queues have different types of services .",
    "for instance , some queues might be served using a gated service , while the others are served using an exhaustive service .",
    "normally users leave the system immediately after receiving their service .",
    "a variant is polling systems with rerouting ( @xcite ) .",
    "when rerouting applies , users who have received their service can either leave the system or be transferred to a new queue to receive a new service with a given probability .",
    "it is noted that the queue which the user is rerouted to can be the same as the queue where he previously received service .",
    "it is also noted that a user might be rerouted multiple times .    as already mentioned polling systems with a finite number of queues",
    "are called discrete polling systems . _",
    "continuous polling systems are polling systems in which users wait for service anywhere in a continuous set ( a subset of a plane ) . _",
    "a server moves along a closed path , stops when it encounters a user requiring service and resumes its journey after service completion .",
    "the above variants of discrete polling systems can be extended to continuous polling systems . in _",
    "gated service _ , users are served immediately upon encountering the server .",
    "exhaustive service and gated service are equivalent when there are no waiting lines . in mixed polling systems",
    "( waiting lines can be formed due to discrete arrivals ) with exhaustive service the server leaves a queue only when it is empty . in _ globally gated service _ ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the server closes a global gate when it reaches a pre - determined point ( say @xmath1 ) and marks all the users that arrived before the gate closure .",
    "the server goes through its path and only serves the marked users before returning to @xmath1 .",
    "most continuous polling systems are studied under the standard _ gated service _ assumption ( @xcite ) . as in the discrete case , there can be rerouting .",
    "users who have received their service are transfered to a different location for another service according to some probability distribution . in @xcite ,",
    "a continuous polling system is considered , where users can be rerouted only one time . in this paper",
    "we extend it to an arbitrary finite number of reroutings .",
    "we consider a random number of reroutings .",
    "the number of reroutings is upper bounded by a finite constant with probability one .",
    "the extension to an infinite number of reroutings would be a non - trivial extension .",
    "we assume poisson arrivals .",
    "this assumption is used extensively in the proofs by application of wald s lemma .",
    "similarly , any other generalization of assumptions would be non - trivial .",
    "_ our contribution : _    the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a polling model which bridges the gap between discrete and continuous polling systems and generalizes them .",
    "we call such a model a _ mixed polling system_. we call the distribution of the location of users arrivals the `` arrival position distribution '' . in a discrete polling system ,",
    "the arrival position distribution is a discrete distribution on a finite set . in a continuous polling system ,",
    "the arrival position distribution has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "in other words the distribution has no atoms and the probability of arriving at any point is @xmath1 .",
    "a mixed polling system combines the two : the arrival position distribution is a sum of a discrete distribution with a finite number of atoms , and a continuous distribution which has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure .",
    "extending existing results on continuous and discrete polling systems to mixed polling systems requires significant changes in the proof techniques with respect to previous papers ( @xcite ) and these issues are discussed later . following a discretization approach as in the earlier papers  @xcite , we obtain the stationary expected workload as the limit of the stationary expected workload of a discrete system .",
    "we discretize the mixed polling system in such a way that the pseudo conservation laws of sidi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for discrete polling systems with rerouting are applicable .",
    "mixed polling systems significantly extend the discrete and continuous polling models .",
    "we show in this paper that even for a fairly simple application , the arrival position distribution has both continuous and discrete components .",
    "hence mixed polling systems enable the analysis of many new applications of interest .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first work to consider a polling system which :    * has an arbitrary finite number of reroutings , and * generalizes continuous and discrete polling systems i.e. a mixed polling system .      in a ferry assisted wireless lan ( fwlan ) ,",
    "nodes are not connected directly and use a mobile relay known as a message ferry .",
    "the message ferry serves as a `` postman '' and delivers messages exchanged by the nodes .",
    "nodes might be static or dynamic .",
    "the ferry moves periodically on a cyclic route and stops when it is in the vicinity of a user with data to transmit or receive",
    ". the ferry must be close enough to the user to ensure reliable communication over a wireless link .",
    "it is noted that the network area can be large and the transmission power can be limited .",
    "we study a fwlan , where both local and external data transfers occur .",
    "namely , there is a base station which is a gateway to the external world . during an external data transfer",
    ", the ferry receives the message from the base station , and delivers it to the sink , when it reaches the vicinity of the sink ( and vice - versa ) . for a local data transfer",
    "the source and the sink are arbitrary points on the path .",
    "the only difference with an external transfer is that the ferry receives the message from a source user ( located anywhere in the area ) .",
    "finally we have a hybrid data transfer when a local data transfer is accomplished with the help of the base station .",
    "external and local data transfers require two services at two locations while hybrid transfers require service at three locations . to model such fwlans we need polling systems that support more than one service such as the new polling systems studied in this paper .",
    "as far as the network geometry is concerned , we consider rectangular ferry paths . in this model",
    "the arrival position distribution ( when `` projected '' on the rectangular ferry path ) has atoms at the corner points , and has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure elsewhere .",
    "this can not be modeled either by a continuous polling system or by a discrete polling system .",
    "it actually requires the combination of the two , i.e. the mixed polling systems studied in this paper to analyze the system performance .",
    "we consider a second application which is a distributed waste collection system .",
    "a van collects waste from locations that are spread over a large geographical area .",
    "waste generation occurs at a stationary rate , for example when rescue operations take place in an area hit by a natural disaster or in a production unit where production of intermediate products takes place at different geographical locations .",
    "a fwlan where information is collected from all the nodes and transmitted to a fixed gateway also falls under this category . _",
    "continuous models are required whenever the waste generation points are arbitrary and vary from cycle to cycle .",
    "even if the waste generation points are fixed but are large in number , one can obtain simpler formulas by approximating the system by a continuous polling model .",
    "_ given the distribution of the waste generation points and the rate of generation , we obtain a waste collection point minimizing the stationary workload . here",
    "again one requires the mixed polling systems of this paper , because the first service ( waste collection ) occurs anywhere in the path , while the second service ( discarding the waste ) happens at one fixed point .    in all applications",
    ", we minimize the stationary average virtual workload .",
    "this is pareto optimal for all the waiting users optimizing their expected waiting times ( see @xcite ) .",
    "continuous polling systems were first introduced by fuhrmann and cooper @xcite , further explored by coffman and gilbert @xcite and kroese and schmidt @xcite in a series of works .",
    "stability results are available in @xcite .",
    "the continuous systems are usually analyzed under simplified conditions , which we call `` symmetric conditions '' : arrival instants form a poisson process and the arrival position distribution is uniform on a circle .",
    "the server moves at a constant speed in a fixed direction .",
    "the service times are identically distributed .",
    "snowplowing systems generalize many of the above assumptions .",
    "for example , the incoming work to the system is taken to be a general lvy random measure and the walking times are assumed to be random ( see for example @xcite ) .    in the literature , continuous polling systems",
    "have usually been analyzed with simple gated / exhaustive service . in @xcite",
    "one of the authors study continuous polling systems with : globally gated service or gated service or a mixture of both or elevator service , without requiring symmetry .    in this paper we do not use the symmetric assumptions and consider rerouting as well as mixed systems . rerouting and",
    "mixed position arrival measure make this paper significantly different from the previous papers ( @xcite ) in terms of results , applications and proof techniques required for obtaining the stationary workload .",
    "polling systems are widely used for modeling and analyzing communication systems , computer hardware and software , and road traffic control .",
    "for example , in @xcite , authors analyze fwlans .",
    "apart from fwlans , there are many other applications in which customers may require more than one service .",
    "such applications are mentioned in @xcite , for instance : 1 ) automatic repeat request ( arq ) protocols used for transmission error recovery ; 2 ) multi threading computers where a single processor performs multiple tasks : computation , disk and memory i / o , switching between threads etc .    .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the system model and notations are introduced in section [ sec_ctspoll ] . in the same section , we state the main result of the paper , theorem [ thrm_mixedservice ] .",
    "we discuss the application of our results to fwlans and a distributed waste collector in sections [ section_fwlan ] and [ section_collect ] respectively .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is given in section  [ section_proof ] .",
    "the appendices contain some details of the proofs .",
    "appendix d summarizes the main notations used in this article .",
    "a server is moving continuously in one direction on a circle @xmath2 with speed @xmath3 .",
    "it stops only when it encounters a user with a request and resumes its journey after serving the encountered user .",
    "we consider a mixed polling system , i.e. the users can either arrive anywhere on the circle @xmath2 or can form waiting queue(s ) at a finite set of points on @xmath2 .",
    "the external arrival process is modeled by a poisson process with intensity @xmath4 and every external / new arrival is associated with two marks : the position @xmath5 distributed as @xmath6 and the service time @xmath7 . the service time can depend upon the position @xmath8 of the new arrival .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the first and second moments of the service time @xmath7 conditioned on the event that the position of arrival is @xmath11 .",
    "the service times of different users are independent of each other .    a user is served the first time the server encounters it on the circle .",
    "after his service is completed , the user is either rerouted , independently of all the previous events , to a new point @xmath12 with probability @xmath13 or exits the system with probability @xmath14 _ it is noted that the rerouting probabilities are independent of the position at which the previous service is obtained . _",
    "the rerouted users are served the next time the server encounters them .",
    "once again they either exit the system with probability @xmath15 or are rerouted to another point with probability @xmath16 independently of all the earlier events and so on .",
    "there can be at most @xmath17 reroutings with @xmath18 .",
    "the rerouting probabilities are @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the arrival and rerouting probabilities can be mixed .",
    "namely , there are positive functions @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 $ ] and constants @xmath23 and a finite set of points @xmath24 such that the probability distribution of the @xmath25 ( rerouted ) arrival is : @xmath26 there can be more than one user waiting at the same point with positive probability ( e.g. , at one of the @xmath27 ) .",
    "the server always serves the user with the largest number of services completed . for instance , a user that has been rerouted once will be served before a user waiting for his first service if they are both waiting at the same point .",
    "the users with the same number of services completed are served in fifo ( first in first out ) order .",
    "the users are rerouted independently of the previous events .",
    "however their service requirement for the @xmath28-th service depends on the position @xmath29 to which they have been rerouted ( after completing the @xmath30-th service ) , which is distributed as @xmath31 .",
    "namely the service depends only upon the position at which it is received , irrespective of the number of reroutings already received .",

    "<S> we analyze two applications using our results on mixed polling systems and discuss the optimal system design . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a local area network , in which a moving ferry facilitates communication ( data transfer ) using a wireless link . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a distributed waste collection system and derive the optimal collection point . in both examples </S>",
    "<S> , the service requests can arrive anywhere in a subset of the two dimensional plane . </S>",
    "<S> namely , some users arrive in a continuous set while others wait for their service in a finite set . </S>",
    "<S> the only polling systems that can model these applications are mixed systems with rerouting as introduced in this manuscript . </S>"
