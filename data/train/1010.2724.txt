    "some of us have recently argued that rotating black holes surrounded by relic cold dark matter ( dm ) density spikes may act as particle accelerators @xcite . in the limit of maximally rotating ,",
    "extremal kerr black holes , we showed that collisions between particles , e.g. weakly interacting massive dm particles , may reach arbitrarily high center - of - mass energies .",
    "for some related works see @xcite .    in this sequel",
    ", we compute the escape fraction and flux at infinity of the highly blue - shifted particles .",
    "we demonstrate that the escape fraction is finite and of interest for any value of @xmath0 although the price one pays for sub - extremality is that the achievable centre - of - mass frame ( cmf ) collision energy is limited .    our earlier work attracted considerable comment with regard to the fact that extremality for a kerr black hole might not be achievable in nature @xcite , although not all authors concur on this point @xcite .",
    "accretion spins up the hole but radiative back - reaction limits the degree of spin - up .",
    "the limit @xmath1 was derived @xcite for a thin accretion disk , and criticised as being nonrealistic for more general situations @xcite .",
    "more recently , the role of binary black hole mergers has been studied and superradiant extraction of angular momentum from the larger black hole has been shown to set the limit @xmath2 @xcite . however we note that these limits apply only to astrophysical constraints , and that string theory may provide alternative options for generating extremal black holes .",
    "given these motivations , it is imperative that we obtain an estimate for the flux expected from the ultra - energetic collisions that take place in the near - horizon region of kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "concretely , we will focus on the flux emitted by dm spikes that form around intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "such dm spikes are expected to extend down to distances that are of order the schwarzschild horizon radius , and to have a density that is essentially set by the annihilation rate of the dm .",
    "we take into account the fact that massless products of ultra - energetic collisions may be captured by the black hole by including a fully - relativistic escape function into the computation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : we first set the scene in the next section , and present a relativistic formula for the total flux expected at infinity from collisions around an imbh .",
    "this formula requires knowledge of the escape function , which encodes the proportion of massless products that arrive at infinity , as well as the dm density profile around the black hole .",
    "we discuss the escape function in section  [ escapefraction ] , and the density profile in section  [ density ] .",
    "we present our results in section  [ results ] , and end by expanding on some open issues that must be tackled to improve and extend the results of this paper .",
    "our aim is to obtain the flux emanating from particle annihilations in a dm spike collapsing around a rotating black hole . we first explain how we intend to compute the flux , for steady - state ( time - independent ) conditions .",
    "the first ingredient is the dm number density in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "we model this using a distribution function in phase space @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coordinates of real space and velocity space respectively .",
    "this distribution function @xmath3 , which is a lorentz scalar , enters the annihilation rate quadratically .",
    "defining @xmath6 as the annihilation cross section for a pair of dm particles and @xmath7 as the relative velocity of two dm particles with velocities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we propose the following formula for the _ invariant cross section _    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the velocity space of the colliding particles .",
    "the preceding equation tells us the number of annihilations taking place locally .",
    "our objective is of course to find the flux of massless particles escaping the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "only massless particles produced with momenta satisfying certain conditions will propagate out to infinity . to obtain the number of escaping massless particles from the annihilation rate",
    ", we must therefore dress the rate of eq .",
    "( [ annihilation ] ) with an `` escape function '' which encodes the probability that the massless annihilation products escape to infinity .",
    "we expect this function to go to zero at the horizon ( such that all of the annihilation products get captured there ) and approach one at infinity , so that all of the annihilation products very far from the black hole escape to infinity and contribute to the flux .",
    "call the escape function @xmath12 , where we make explicit its dependence on the velocities of the colliding dm particles . folding this in with the annihilation rate above",
    ", we have that the number of massless particles escaping the black hole per unit time @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 note that in principle we can use a similar formulation to obtain the flux spectrum , but our sole purpose is to show that the flux is potentially observable . if the observer is a distance @xmath15 away from the black hole , then to find the flux received per unit area per unit time by the observer we must divide the above by @xmath16 as usual .",
    "note that in this work we limit the phase space integration domains @xmath17 to in - falling dm particles moving on geodesics that are captured by the black hole , the so - called  plunge \" orbits , as those are the ones which lead to collisions with high cmf energies .",
    "for our purposes , the spatial integral will be computed in a spherical volume @xmath18 around the black hole , extending to a radius @xmath19 , measured in units where the schwarzschild radius @xmath20 is set to 1 .",
    "the upper limit of the volume integral is a free variable ( in principle ) , and we may choose to restrict it in order to focus on the size of the flux emerging from the near horizon region , where the cmf energies of the collisions are high .",
    "a crucial ingredient required to calculate the flux is the density profile of dm around the black hole . in this paper",
    "we use a density profile corresponding to the  spike \" proposed in @xcite .",
    "this density profile includes the effects of dm annihilation on the dm density ( as well as other effects ) and we shall make the assumption that it provides a good description in all regions down to the black hole horizon .",
    "we stress that this density profile is also non - relativistic , and so its convolution with a fully relativistic ( and exact ) escape function is a source of potential inconsistency but this method provides a relatively straight forward way to estimate the density of dm particles around a black hole .",
    "finally , the types of density spikes described in @xcite correspond to density profiles around non - rotating black holes .",
    "the more energetic collisions occur for rotating black holes , and therefore in a more detailed analysis aimed at finding exact numbers a relativistic density profile is needed .",
    "again we stress that we are only interested at this stage in an order of magnitude estimate for the size of the emergent flux so we leave such refinements to future investigations .    regardless of how one estimates the density profile , in order to calculate the emergent flux we need to know what fraction of collision products escape the gravitational field of the black hole . to make the estimate as straightforward and as clear as possible",
    ", we only consider the simplified case of the annihilation of two dm particles into two massless particles ( e.g. two neutrinos or two photons ) .",
    "the escaping fraction of collision products is an @xmath21-dependent quantity . for the case of a schwarzschild black hole the escape fraction as a function of @xmath21",
    "is a known result and a useful treatment can be found in @xcite .",
    "when considering the case of plunge orbits , the escape fraction becomes more complicated due to the fact that the collision products are boosted towards the black hole . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the calculation of the escape fraction as a function of @xmath21 for both schwarzschild and kerr black holes , including the relativistic effects of the boosts .",
    "in this section , we present an analytic treatment of the escape fraction for massless particles .",
    "these particles are produced in the collisions of the dm particles and are consequently highly boosted towards the centre of the black hole .",
    "the details of this boost are dependent on the momentum of the dm particles .",
    "this of course is determined by the angular momentum of the two dm particles .",
    "it is a relatively straightforward exercise to construct the escape function for a massless particle produced in the gravitational field of a schwarzschild black hole @xcite . here",
    "we want to do a similar calculation but with the massless particles boosted according to the kinematics of the initial colliding dm particles .",
    "let us first examine the motion of massless particles in the locally - nonrotating - frame ( lnrf ) , which is the frame in which an observer who rotates with the local geometry does their measurements .",
    "working in the equatorial plane , the lnrf momentum of a massless particle is given by p^lnrf=(p^lnrf _",

    "we can establish the conditions on the massless particle s 3-momentum as a function of @xmath21 such that the it escapes the gravitational field of the black hole .",
    "this is most easily performed by analysing the turning points ( i.e. where @xmath23 ) of the massless particle as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath25 on the equatorial plane is = 1-+ .",

[ solb ]    we can now use these solutions to tell us whether a massless particle produced at some distance @xmath21 , with particular values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and determines whether the massless particle is moving to larger @xmath28 or smaller @xmath29 radii ) will escape the black hole .    to do this for general @xmath30",
    "analytically is tricky , and we choose to investigate two values of @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 , the schwarzschild limit , and the extreme kerr case of @xmath32 .",
    "other values of @xmath30 give results that are numerically not too different from the analytic results presented below and we leave the details of a numerical treatment for arbitrary @xmath30 to future work @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to find an estimate for the emergent flux rather than to give a precise prediction .",
    "starting with the schwarzschild case , @xmath33 the two solutions of eq .",
    "[ solb ] take the forms b^a=0_(r)= .",
    "we will for the remainder of the schwarzschild discussion omit the superscript @xmath31 , to avoid clutter . by plotting these solutions in fig .",
    "[ bvsr ] we see that for the positive solution there is a minimum and for the negative solution there is a maximum .",
    "both these extrema occur at @xmath34 and have values @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we can now read off the conditions on @xmath24 as a function of @xmath21 that determine whether the massless particle will escape or be captured by the black hole .     as a function of @xmath21 ( in units where @xmath37 ) .",
    "the upper ( red ) curve is @xmath38 whereas the lower ( blue ) curve is @xmath39.[bvsr ] ]    the conditions for the massless particle to escape are for r<3 : = + 1 - 3 > b > 3 , [ con1 ] which simply reflects the fact that a particle produced in the region @xmath40 , with a value of @xmath24 in between the minimum and maximum , will move towards infinity unhindered by the potential barrier . if the particle were produced with @xmath41 , then it will hit the potential barrier and bounce back into the black hole .",
    "similar reasoning then yields the following additional conditions for escape , which apply in the region @xmath42 : [ con2 ] r>3 : & = & + 1 b_-(r ) > b > b_+(r ) ; + [ con3 ] & = & -1 3>b > b_+(r ) ; + [ con4 ] & = & -1 b_-(r)>b > -3 .    for the @xmath43 conditions",
    ", the massless particle will initially be moving to smaller @xmath21 but will reach a turning point ( at a distance @xmath21 determined by the value of @xmath44 ) and will be reflected by the effective potential leading to the escape of the massless particle .    to calculate the escape function , we apply the following logic .",
    "we assume that the annihilation of two dm particles proceeds as @xmath45 where we assert that the @xmath46s are massless particles . as an estimate designed to provide a reasonable order of magnitude measure , we only concern ourselves with the question of whether @xmath47 escapes . by doing this , we avoid the complications introduced by trying to consistently analyse whether either , both or neither @xmath47 or @xmath48 escape .",
    "we construct the measure by assuming that in the cmf of the collision , @xmath47 is produced isotropically , that is , there is no preferred direction . in the cmf , there is an @xmath21 dependent range of angles that correspond to particular values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 ( evaluated in the lnrf ) that satisfy the conditions for @xmath47 to escape .",
    "in other words , the conditions on the values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 for the massless particle to escape in the lnrf ( eqs .",
    "( [ con1 ] ) - ( [ con4 ] ) ) can be mapped onto a range of angles in the cmf of the collision in which @xmath47 is produced .",
    "because of the assumption that the production in the cmf is isotropic , the escape fraction can be computed in terms of the ratio of this range of angles over the full @xmath49 in the cmf on the equatorial plane .",
    "the situation can therefore be summarised as follows : two dm particles collide at a given @xmath21 with two respective angular momenta .",
    "we have two frames : the lnrf frame , which we can think of conventionally as the lab frame , and the cmf of the collision .",
    "the two frames are related by a boost , which is defined by the radial position and the angular momenta of the colliding dm particles .",
    "it is this boost that provides the mapping between the escape conditions on @xmath24 and @xmath26 and the range of angles in the cmf .",
    "one immediate important point is that by assuming the massless particles are only produced and escaping in the equatorial plane , we are potentially overestimating the escape fraction .",
    "however , this is not entirely clear as some particles could still escape even if they have trajectories that take them off the equatorial plane . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our analysis to the equatorial plane . in a paper to appear , a numerical analysis is performed , @xcite , where it is shown that this approximation is indeed a good one to the accuracy to which we wish to work in this analysis .    to find the @xmath21-dependent range of angles in the cmf that corresponds to the full range of escape conditions for @xmath24 and @xmath26 in the lnrf",

    "we simply apply a boost to the lnrf momenta for the massless particles such that p^cmf=.p^lnrf , is the cmf momenta and where @xmath51 is a general lorentz boost in the equatorial plane that can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the usual parameters of the lorentz boost .",
    "the exact form of this boost is determined by the momenta of the dm particles that are colliding together .",

    "therefore , we assume that the dm density is essentially flat from the black hole horizon all the way up to values of the radius which are @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "we emphasize that the details of the dm density profile at such radii are irrelevant for us , as we are interested in the most energetic particles resulting from annihilations taking place at radii that are @xmath118 .",
    "the density in the annihilation plateau is given by @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the thermal - averaged annihilation rate per unit volume , @xmath121 is the dm mass , and @xmath122 is the time - scale for spike formation . for details of the annihilation plateau ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "although we now have an estimate for the _ total _ dm density in the near - horizon region , we are still short of information as to the composition of the dm particles with regard to their angular momenta .",
    "this is of crucial importance because the energies of the emitted photons are set by the angular momenta of the colliding dm particles , and the very energetic collisions can occur for dm particles in plunge orbits .",
    "so what we must do is obtain an estimate of the proportion of particles in the plateau which are in fact within the plunge range of the black hole .",
    "the complexity of the problem means that this is beyond the scope of the paper , and , given that we are only interested in an order - of - magnitude estimate of the flux emitted in the immediate vicinity of the horizon , we simply assume a flat distribution in angular momentum .",
    "in addition , we assume that for the particles colliding near the horizon , the proportions of plunge and bound geodesics are comparable and so we take the absolute value of the density of both to be of order the height of the plateau .",
    "we remind the reader that the correct angular momentum decomposition of the dm particles in the plateau is likely to be very complicated , especially in the near - horizon region .",
    "our aim in this analysis is to estimate the size of the total emergent flux originating from near horizon collisions .",
    "it turns out that we are almost insensitive to the details of the angular momentum distribution as we are effectively integrating over the full range of angular momentum states .",
    "if we wanted to calculate the energy spectrum of the emerging massless particles the choice of the angular momentum distribution becomes more important with the potential to change the shape of the spectrum .",
    "in this section we put together the ingredients computed so far : the density in the near - horizon region and the escape fraction to calculate the flux .",
    "going back to eqs .",
    "( [ annihilation ] ) and ( [ flux ] ) , for plunge orbits we can exchange the dependence on the velocities for a dependence on the angular momentum of the colliding particles .",
    "the phase space distributions , @xmath123 , can in principle be recast as functions of @xmath124 and @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath89 dependence encodes the distribution of angular momentum states which in general changes with @xmath124 .",
    "this @xmath124 dependent distribution is unknown ( as discussed above ) and we make the approximation that we can factorize the @xmath89 dependence from @xmath123 ( such that this distribution is constant in @xmath124 ) .",
    "we now assume that the remaining distribution function in @xmath89 is flat across the allowed range in @xmath89 .",
    "in addition , the escape function @xmath125 changes slowly with @xmath57 and so we can treat it as a constant with respect to the integral over the angular momenta of the colliding particles .",
    "further to this assumption we remind the reader that the escape fraction has been calculated for the equatorial plane only .",
    "to do the full volume integral we need to know how the escape function changes as we go off the equatorial plane . instead of changing the form of the escape function to account for this variation ( which is a task most",
    "easily completed numerically ) we assume a spherical symmetry such that we can use the same escape fraction for the full volume .",
    "we can convert the number density @xmath126 to a mass density @xmath127 by dividing by the rest mass @xmath128 . for our purposes we set this density equal to the plateau density @xmath129 .",
    "the final form for the flux arriving at some distance @xmath15 away from the black hole simplifies to a spherically symmetric volume integral ( a consequence of the assumed spherical symmetry of the density and escape function in the near - horizon region ) and can be written as @xmath130 where @xmath131 is to be taken as some typical annihilation cross section , @xmath132 is the mass of the dm particle , and @xmath15 is the distance to the black hole .",
    "a further complication which we do not address here is that the cross section will in general be energy and therefore @xmath21 dependent . as we wish to make a simple estimate of the flux we take the cross section to be constant in energy .",
    "a further simplification is that we assume that @xmath133 is dominated by an s - wave term , which is velocity independent . in doing",
    "so @xmath133 is assumed to be just a constant . in general",
    "there will be velocity dependent terms and consequently we would replace @xmath134 with the equivalent thermally averaged cross section .",
    "note also that the form of the flux in eq .",
    "[ flux ] is similar to the flux spectrum constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the addition of the escape function .",
    "ref.@xcite deals with the flux spectrum @xmath135 which requires an additional ingredient @xmath136 , which is the number of secondary particles produced per annihilation .",
    "we are interested in the total flux of particles , rather than the flux spectrum ( the latter is obviously very important , but its calculation is much harder in a relativistic setting ) .",
    "we can trivially convert the flux spectrum to total flux by assuming that photons reaching us will have energies bunched around the mass of the dm particle , so that it is safe for our purposes to write @xmath137 and integrate trivially over energy to obtain the total flux in eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) .",
    "the escape fraction @xmath125 was computed in section  [ escapefraction ] .",
    "it is relativistic , and so its convolution with a non - relativistic density is one of the major approximations in this work .",
    "as the escape function is slowly varying with @xmath57 we may choose @xmath138 as we wish ( if we knew the angular - momentum distribution of the plateau then we would have integrated over these two variables weighted by the distribution function in angular - momentum space ) .",
    "we choose one of @xmath139 and @xmath140 to be the critical angular - momenta corresponding to the highest - energy collisions .",
    "this choice will not alter the order of magnitude of the results below .",
    "the density @xmath141 is simply the _ mass _ density of dm particles that are on plunge orbits .",
    "as outlined above , we will use @xmath142 , again implicitly assuming that the proportion of plunge particles is of the same size as non - plunge particles .",
    "note that we are integrating from the horizon @xmath143 up to an upper radius @xmath144 which is a few horizon lengths .",
    "the factor of @xmath145 is necessary for converting the integral from @xmath37 units to si units . plugging everything in",
    "we are left with @xmath146 where we have isolated the dimensionless integral @xmath147 inside which is found _ all _ of the dependence on the rotation of the black hole .",
    "this dependence on the rotation parameter @xmath30 , which enters into the limits of the integral as well as the integrand , is obviously rather complicated . computing this integral for extremal kerr and for schwarzschild , with @xmath148 for both ( and with @xmath149 for kerr and @xmath150 for schwarzschild )",
    ", we obtain @xmath151 and @xmath152 . for comparison",
    ", we note that if we put 1 in place of the escape fraction we obtain the values @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "we can now give an estimate of the expected emergent flux .",
    "we use the following fiducial values for our various parameters : we set the mass of the black hole using @xmath113 and set it equal to @xmath155 in units of @xmath156 solar masses .",
    "we use @xmath157 , set the distance between us and the black hole to @xmath158 and assume that the growth time - scale of the black hole is @xmath159 years .",
    "the total flux is then given by : @xmath160 where @xmath161 .",
    "note that by writing the flux in this fashion we have placed all of the dependence on the geometry into the integral @xmath162 .",
    "we see that imbhs can be bright dm annihilation sources , and this has been explored and constrained in the literature @xcite . for the case of extremal kerr , integrating up to @xmath163 ,",
    "we obtain the flux to be @xmath164 .",
    "this is well within the reach of planned neutrino detectors .",
    "if we integrate only up to @xmath165 for extremal kerr , thereby including the emergent flux of massless particles coming from the most energetic annihilations , we obtain an expected number of @xmath166 futuristic large area high energy neutrino / particle detectors in space such as owl ( @xmath167 ) would have an effective detection area solid angle efficiency product in excess of @xmath168 and could detect such signals over a few days ( admittedly only above @xmath169 ) .",
    "we note below that penrose boosting may allow such energies to be achievable at infinity .    while the actual flux from an imbh depends on its distance from us and on the other reference parameters , which are uncertain by several orders of magnitude , we note that our calculation of a finite escape fraction which is weakly dependent on the black hole angular momentum means that even detection of a single event might open a window on new physics , attainable only via particle collisions at extreme cmf energies .",
    "our final result should be viewed as an order of magnitude estimate of the flux received on earth , which we find to be the same with or without black hole rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "given that very high ( even arbitrarily high ) energies can be achieved in the annihilations around a rotating black hole , while the schwarzschild geometry only allows _",
    "maximal _ cmf energies of @xmath170 , our results imply that the spectrum received from a rotating black hole should typically contain signatures of highly energetic products .",
    "a next step is to compute the spectrum as a function of @xmath30 to confirm this expectation .",
    "we leave this for future work .",
    "we obtained above an order - of - magnitude estimate for the blue - shifted flux emitted by dm annihilations in the near - horizon region of an extremal kerr black hole .",
    "we made several approximations and assumptions along the way that made the calculation tractable .",
    "we assumed that the escape function calculated purely on the equatorial plane was sufficient , restricting the colliding dm particles and the escaping particles to motion only on the equatorial plane .",
    "we also assumed that the dm  spike \" around the black hole was non - relativistic and spherically symmetric , and that it was flat right down to the black hole horizon .",
    "in our view , the former of these two concerns is unlikely to be a source of large errors , because the escape fraction goes from zero to one regardless of the dimensionality or the geometry .",
    "it is very easy to check using our results above that the change from schwarzschild to kerr makes very little difference to the escape function .",
    "moreover , some work we have done , and upcoming work @xcite , shows that going to three - dimensions does not change the results significantly , thus corroborating our intuition .",
    "the concern about the dm density profile is rather more serious , because the density enters the flux quadratically .",
    "several effects need to be studied more rigorously , chief among them being the effect of the rotating geometry on the dm spike , as well as the feasibility of a more accurate modelling of the spike close to the black hole horizon in a fully relativistic fashion .",
    "the advantage of such a construction is that it should naturally yield the composition of angular momentum in the dm spike , which is crucial for the flux and its spectrum .",
    "we should mention here that a reliable computation of the flux spectrum requires another ingredient : an explicit particle physics model of the dm and its interactions .",
    "this is necessary because it determines the energy dependence of the differential cross section of the annihilation diagrams , which , coupled with the geometry - dependent cmf energy of the collisions , feeds directly into the differential flux spectrum .",
    "the flux spectrum is therefore expected to be a far more revealing signature than the total flux , as it should contain clues as to the nature and composition of the dm spike .",
    "for example , we naively expect the spectrum to bunch around the dm mass , which in itself would be an exciting observation .",
    "there are further necessary refinements of our work that we would like to comment on .",
    "the computation of the cmf energy in the kerr field reference @xcite neglected back - reaction effects , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "this issue deserves further attention . finally , supermassive black holes , the nearest one of which is at our galactic centre ,",
    "should not be ruled out as possible sources of annihilating dm . even after partial destruction by a complex merging history , something which is not necessarily an issue very close to @xmath22 , cusps , albeit with softer profiles , are regenerated by dynamical processes @xcite .",
    "finally , one of the most intriguing aspects , that we reserve for future work , is the exploration of the penrose process @xcite , which may allow the escaping annihilation products to tap the rotational energy of the kerr black hole , provided that the collisions occur within the black hole ergosphere .",
    "this effect was briefly considered in @xcite , but the potential remains to be fully explored .",
