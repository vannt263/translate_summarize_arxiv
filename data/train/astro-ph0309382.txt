    "structure and kinematics in the jets of radio - loud agns have been studied for long time spans , yielding discoveries such as superluminal motion , flux density outbursts which mark the ejection of new jet components , and twisted magnetic fields within the jets .",
    "only little is known about the physically less extreme radio - weak objects , and only those few that are strong enough are suitable for detailed vlbi studies .",
    "ngc3079 is one of the brightest seyfert 2 galaxies , and shows significant changes in radio configuration , component spectra and overall geometry on a timescale of a few years .",
    "it can contribute important insights to our understanding of the difference between radio - loud and radio - weak agn .",
    "ngc  3079 is a nearby seyfert 2 or liner galaxy at a distance of 15  mpc with embedded @xmath1 maser emission .",
    "vla b - array observations at 6  cm show a bright core and two prominent radio lobes .",
    "these lobes extend 2kpc away from the nucleus in p.a .",
    "@xmath2 , almost perpendicular to the disc of the galaxy in p.a . @xmath3 ( duric et al . 1983 ) .",
    "pilot vlbi observations by irwin & seaquist ( 1988 ) resolved the core into two strong components , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , separated by 1.47pc in p.a .",
    "@xmath6 ( relative to @xmath4 ) .",
    "they also found emission along a line between these components , suggestive of a jet - like feature , which they named @xmath7 .",
    "these three components do not align with either the kpc - scale lobes or the galaxy disc .",
    "spectral - line and continuum observations by trotter et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and sawada - satoh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( hereafter s00 ) have resolved the @xmath8 maser emission in ngc  3079 into numerous aligned spots at almost the same p.a . as the galaxy disc and at an angle of @xmath9 with respect to the jet axis .",
    "those authors suggest that the location of the nucleus is on the @xmath4-@xmath5 axis , where it intersects with the line of masers , although there is no radio emission from that location .",
    "another component , @xmath10 , was found by t98 further down the @xmath4-@xmath5 axis but was not confirmed by s00 . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 were found by s00 to separate at @xmath11 , and @xmath5 appeared to be stationary with respect to the brightest maser clumps .",
    "we have observed ngc3079 at 1.7ghz , 2.3ghz , 5.0ghz and 15.4ghz during four epochs ( table  1 ) .",
    "all observations were made with the vlba and effelsberg , except for the 2.3 and 5.0ghz observations in 2002 - 09 - 22 which were made with the vlba only .",
    "only the observations of the last epoch included polarization measurements and were phase - referenced to a calibrator . at 1.7ghz",
    "the source is very weak and resolved and was not detected on baselines longer than @xmath12 .",
    "phase - referencing , however , yielded a good ( @xmath13 ) detection .",
    "the determination of instrumental polarization did not work at 2.3ghz , and so polarization information could be obtained only at 1.7ghz and 5.0ghz . at 15.4ghz ,",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the images from 2002 - 09 - 22 and the 15.4ghz image from 2000 - 11 - 30 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we have detected two new components @xmath15 and @xmath16 at 1.7ghz to 5.0ghz in addition to the known components @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "two components are visible at 1.7ghz , a more compact one to the north - west ( @xmath15 ) and an extended one to the south - east ( @xmath16 ) . based on absolute coordinates , we find that these components are not coincident with @xmath4 and @xmath5 seen at higher frequencies , despite having a similar separation and relative position angle .",
    "they are , instead , coincident with @xmath15 and @xmath16 seen at 5.0ghz . at 2.3ghz , component @xmath16 has weakened , but @xmath15 has become stronger . south of @xmath15 , component @xmath4 starts to show up , but @xmath5 is still not detected . only at 5.0ghz are all components visible , including the jet - like feature @xmath7 and a weak detection of @xmath16 . at 15ghz , only @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are detected .",
    "our polarimetric observations did not show polarized emission at 1.7ghz or 5.0ghz , the limits being 2.2% and 1.2% , respectively .",
    "+      the big spectral differences among the components are illustrated in fig .  2 ( left panel ) .",
    "the graphs show the spectra of ( top to bottom ) @xmath16 , @xmath15 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "component @xmath4 has a highly inverted spectrum with @xmath17 between 2.3ghz and 5.0ghz and a steep spectrum with @xmath18 ( 2000 - 11 - 30 ) .",
    "however , this has significantly evolved from @xmath19 in 1999 - 11 - 20 .",
    "component @xmath5 also has an inverted spectrum with @xmath20 to 1.08 during the first three epochs .",
    "@xmath5 was detected only at 5.0ghz in 2002 - 09 - 22 , yielding a lower limit of @xmath21 .",
    "the new component @xmath15 has a very peculiar , narrow - peaked spectrum , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption can not explain the inverted side with @xmath22 , and free - free absorption ( ffa ) in a foreground absorber is the most likely cause .",
    "if ffa is present , the observed spectrum will be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , resulting in an exponential cutoff towards lower frequencies .",
    "however , fitting a spectrum of this form to the data yields an uncommonly _ steep _ intrinsic spectral index ( before the absorber ) of @xmath26 .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the electrons in the source population are not replenished and age , causing a cutoff towards high frequencies .",
    "if so , the ffa and electron population cutoffs would need to be very close in frequency .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath16 is extremely steep between 1.7ghz and 2.3ghz , with @xmath27 .",
    "we consider it most unlikely that the extreme spectra of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are due to resolution effects , because we used approximately scaled arrays ( i.e. , effelsberg was included at 1.7ghz only ) and the data were calibrated and analyzed in the same manner , using the same tapering , weights , and imaging procedures .",
    "the peak frequencies increase with decreasing ra of the components , suggestive of a gradient in a foreground absorber ( in the shape of a wedge ? ) or , alternatively , an absorber with considerable and clumpy sub - structure on sub - pc scales .      as absolute positions are lost in phase self - calibration , the analysis of motions inside ngc3079 is restricted to relative position changes .",
    "the component separations shown in table  2 yield speeds of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where the determination of @xmath31 has been supplemented by literature data . selecting either @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath15 as the stationary reference point",
    "then yields three different scenarios , and we consider the one shown in fig .  2 ( @xmath15 stationary ) the most natural .",
    "although we do not believe that @xmath15 is the nucleus , it might be kinematically disconnected from the agn and hence be quasi - stationary over the observed epochs .",
    "the back - extrapolations of the trajectories of @xmath4 and @xmath5 then intersect in the past , from which point they may have been ejected .",
    "however , the nature of @xmath15 remains unclear .",
    "it can not be a starburst due to its high brightness temperature , @xmath32 at 2.3ghz , but it could be a supernova . in previously suggested scenarios ( s00 , greenhill et al .",
    "2003 , this conference ) , @xmath5 was assumed to be stationary .",
    "if so , @xmath15 would be moving _",
    "inwards _ , perpendicular to the @xmath4-@xmath5 axis , at @xmath33 .",
    "although the evidence from the maser observations is strong , we consider this situation more difficult to understand than the scenario in which @xmath15 is stationary .",
    "we have searched the literature for vlbi observations of seyfert galaxies to see how ngc3079 compares to other objects .",
    "we have found 33 spectral indices of components in 13 seyferts , and 11 seyferts where a linear structure is seen both on pc and kpc scales ( fig .",
    "the spectral indices cluster around @xmath34 , as expected for optically thin synchrotron emission , and then fade into a tail out to + 5 .",
    "the points between @xmath35 and @xmath36 were measured in ngc3079 ( components @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , indicating that this galaxy is a special object . however , 10 out of 13 objects have flat ( @xmath37 ) or inverted ( @xmath38 ) spectra , indicating compact synchrotron emission or free - free absorption .",
    "the pc- and kpc - scale structures in seyferts show no strong tendency to be aligned : 8 out of 11 are misaligned with angles of @xmath39 between pc and kpc - scale structure .",
    "this indicates a difference from powerful radio objects , which show a bimodal distribution , tending to be either aligned or perpendicular ( pearson & readhead 1988 , conway & murphy 1993 ) .",
    "the frequent misalignment in seyferts indicates either precession of the jet ejection axis or pressure gradients and interactions with the ism on scales of tens to hundreds of pc ."
