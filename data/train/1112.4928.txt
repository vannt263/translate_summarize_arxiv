    "electroweak symmetry breaking is a cornerstone for our understanding of particle physics . however , despite the spectacular phenomenological success of the standard model ( sm ) , the fundamental mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking remains a mystery .",

    "one such class of models is based upon topcolor  @xcite which can generate a large top - quark mass .",
    "the topcolor model also predicts a @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the physics in production and decay of the @xmath0 are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite under different model assumptions . in this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath0 from model iv which represents a novel class and has predicted cross sections large enough to be experimentally accessible at hadron colliders at the fermilab tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "such @xmath0 resonances couple strongly only to the first and third generations of quarks , and have no significant couplings to the leptons .",
    "they are , therefore , leptophobic and topophyllic .",
    "this article presents an updated calculation valid for the tevatron and all proposed lhc collision energies .",
    "the leptophobic topcolor @xmath0 decaying to @xmath5 has been searched for at both the tevatron  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",

    "have used the cross section calculation presented here to set limits on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "this article is primarily intended to document that @xmath0 cross section used for a @xmath3 collision energy of @xmath6  tev . for current and future lhc searches ,",
    "we present the @xmath0 cross section at the current lhc @xmath3 collision energy of @xmath7  tev and the potential future collision energies of 10 and 14  tev . we also present the cross section in @xmath8 collisions at @xmath9  tev for comparison with tevatron searches .",
