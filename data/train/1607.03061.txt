    "previously , @xcite used a velocity dispersion profile map to illustrate that the western side of ne cloud was experiencing greater disruption than the east .",
    "additionally , the greatest level of dispersion , in both physical area and magnitude , was seen in the line .",
    "figure[fig : veldispmultipanel ] presents four velocity dispersion ( intensity - weighted fwhm , see _",
    "moment2 _ in @xcite ) images generated using our sensitive 3 transition data .",
    "this series of images has similar features to those in @xcite , although one new structure is observed .",
    "the deeper data now reveals two peaks or a long finger of broad gas in the dispersion map ( compared to only one in @xcite ) .",
    "one peak is towards the centre - east of the cloud core ( [ @xmath30,@xmath38@xmath21[270.44,-23.42 ] ) , which was previously observed , whereas a second , slightly stronger peak is detected towards the western side of the cloud([@xmath30,@xmath38@xmath21[270.37,-23.42 ] ) .",
    "the former peak in ( 1,1 ) velocity dispersion also appears to correspond to an eastern extension in the ( 4,4 ) dispersion image .",
    "we note that @xcite showed shock - tracing sio(1 - 0 ) emission towards the western side of the cloud , but this new nh@xmath4(1,1 ) velocity dispersion peak lies even further west , as illustrated in figure[fig : veldispmultipanel ] .",
    "furthermore , the peak of nh@xmath4(4,4 ) velocity dispersion appears spatially better - matched to the sio(1 - 0 ) emission ( with a fwhm a factor 2 less than that of nh3(1,1 ) emission ) , suggesting that this is the most disturbed part of the cloud .",
    "six 1720mhz oh masers lie around the periphery of this region , suggesting that conditions conducive to the generation of 1720mhz oh masers directed towards the earth are not present in the densest , most - energetic region of the north - east cloud , but are instead offset from the position of peak nh@xmath4(4,4 ) emission .",
    "another indication of a disruption occurring from the south - west side of the cloud can be seen in images of peak intensity ratios in figure[fig : ratios ] .",
    "the raw values of these images are a product of several inter - related parameters , hence are difficult to directly interpret .",
    "the gradients in these images indicate a general trend towards a greater intensity of higher - energy inversion transitions towards the south - west compared to nh@xmath4(1,1 ) .",
    "this trend is particularly prominent for the nh@xmath4(3,3 ) inversion line , unclear from the nh@xmath4(6,6 ) and less prominent for the nh@xmath4(2,2 ) and ( 4,4 ) lines .",
    "on examining the nh@xmath4(3,3)/nh@xmath4(1,1 ) gradient , it is clear that a temperature gradient is present , although we ca nt immediately discount the possibility of effects caused by differences in ortho and para - nh@xmath4 abundances in a shocked / energetic region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this issue is considered in section[ssec : params ] .",
    "certainly the nh@xmath4(3,3 ) emission does exhibit another unique feature - a southern lobe present in the ( 3,3 ) dispersion image ( figure[fig : veldispmultipanel ] ) , but not in the ( 1,1 ) or ( 2,2 ) images .",
    "this extension is also seen in co(3 - 2 ) emission @xcite , so a hot component may be seen to extend towards this same location .          the greater sensitivity achieved from deep 12",
    "mm mapping has allowed us to parametrise the 3 satellite lines on a pixel - by - pixel ( pbp ) basis .",
    "an 3 analysis could thus be performed on arcminute scales .",
    "this includes the calculation of main line optical depth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 2 ) , 3 energetic state column densities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation9 ) , the rotation temperature ( via rotation diagrams ) and the total 3 column density .",
    "a summary of the formulae employed can be found in section b1 of @xcite , but the method presented here is adjusted to account for higher temperatures .",
    "our pbp procedure considered each pixel in the , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) and ( 6,6 ) data cubes separately , and does not attempt to use low signal - noise nh@xmath4(9,9 ) emission .",
    "five gaussian functions were fitted to the 5 satellite components of emission , and pixels that had a peak main line intensity @xmath39k ( @xmath40 ) were discarded ( set equal to zero ) .",
    "this threshold was decided after the examination of a sample of spectral fits , ensuring that only high - quality spectral parameters were used in our analyses .",
    "the optical depth was calculated , and the spectra were fit by single gaussian functions ( satellite lines were generally not resolved for emission ) .",
    "the , ( 2,2 ) , ( 3,3 ) , ( 4,4 ) and ( 6,6 ) column densities @xcite were then calculated for all pixels with an integrated emission threshold above 0.5k.km.s@xmath13 ( @xmath213@xmath19 ) .",

    "figure[fig : rotdiag ] illustrates the difference between the two rotational temperatures attributable to a pixel that is representative of the region with detections of all measured nh@xmath4 lines .",
    "we attribute this to the existence of ` cold ' and ` hot ' components , with the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions being dominated by the more extensive cold component .",
    "the region where nh@xmath4(6,6 ) , ( 4,4 ) and ( 3,3 ) emission was observed was treated as a hot component and the ortho - para - ratio was calculated by finding the ratio between the observed nh@xmath4(4,4 ) column density and that inferred from a trend line between the points corresponding to the ( 3,3 ) and ( 6,6 ) on the rotational diagram . in doing this , we interpolate that @xmath44 , which is a valid assumption if all the nh@xmath4(3,3)-(6,6 ) emission originates from the same region .",

    "the average nh@xmath4 column density within the region is ( 1.5@xmath500.6)@xmath3410@xmath69@xmath68 , leading to an estimated @xmath70 abundance of [ @xmath63/[h@xmath5]@xmath6 .",
    "nh@xmath4 abundance is observed to vary in different galactic environments , with nh@xmath4 molecules being released from dust - grains in warm environments , while being vulnerable to photo - dissociation in ionising uv and cr radiation fields .",
    "typical nh@xmath4 abundance values inside infrared - dark clouds are of the order 10@xmath71 @xcite , with hot ( @xmath0100k ) regions sublimating enough nh@xmath4 from dust grain mantles ( e.g @xcite ) to make the gas - phase abundance increase , sometimes as high as @xmath2110@xmath72 @xcite . such behaviour is also observed towards some shocks to various levels , e.g. [ @xmath63/[h@xmath5]@xmath2110@xmath72 in the bipolar outflow l1152 @xcite and @xmath2110@xmath71 in the wolf - rayet nebula ngc2359 @xcite .",
    "photo - dissociation can have the opposite effect on nh@xmath4 abundance , like near the intense uv field of the luminous blue variable star g79.29 + 0.476 @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray ( cr ) dissociation can also play a role according to modelling of the chemistry in cr - dominated regions , with ionisation rates above 10@xmath73s@xmath13 resulting in a significant decrease in nh@xmath4 abundance @xcite . although the average ionisation rate inside dense clouds might be as low as 10@xmath74 - 10@xmath75s@xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , direct measurements in the far north of the ne cloud suggest ionisation rates on the order of 10@xmath76s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the w28 ne cloud is likely a clumpy region and this can be investigated by by estimating the filling factor , @xmath77 . by assuming a spherical clump of density , @xmath78 , and line - of - sight thickness , @xmath79 , within the mopra beam area , the column density can be expressed as @xmath80 .",
    "the filling factor in this case would be the ratio of the cross - sectional area of the emitting clump , @xmath81 , and the beam area , @xmath82 , leading to @xmath83 . combining the column density and filling factor equations",
    "then allows an estimation of the filling factor , @xmath84where @xmath85 is the nh@xmath4 abundance with respect to molecular hydrogen .",
    "d@xmath211.2pc corresponds to the mopra beam fwhm at 2kpc . from the non - lte analyses , regions a and",
    "b were estimated to have densities of @xmath58-@xmath59 and @xmath60@xmath2 , respectively ( see section[sec : coldenstemp ] ) . inserting these values into equation[equ : fillfac ] yields filling factors of @xmath86-@xmath87 and @xmath212 for regions a and b",
    ", respectively these estimates suggest that emitting nh@xmath88 clumps are distributed on scales from 0.2@xmath24 to scales comparable to the beam fwhm ( 2@xmath24 ) .",
    "interferometric nh@xmath4 observations of finer angular resolution may be able to resolve such structure within the mopra beam .",
    "indeed , sio(1 - 0 ) observations already show features on a 1@xmath24-scales ( see figure[fig : comparison1 ] and @xcite ) .    given the complexity of this region , the estimated nh@xmath4 abundance of @xmath89 from the lte analysis presented in this paper may be the result of a balancing between nh@xmath4-release from dust grains and nh@xmath4-destruction pathways resulting from radiation and crs .",
    "an elevated opr , like that observed in regionb , suggests that nh@xmath4 has been released from dust grains @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is no indication that an accompanying nh@xmath4 abundance increase has occurred .",
    "in fact , the nh@xmath4 abundance may be an order of magnitude below that of a typical infrared - dark cloud , despite the high temperature and shocked environment ( see section[ssec : veldisp ] ) .",
    "this low abundance may suggest that an nh@xmath4 destruction mechanism is playing a significant role . through this line of reasoning",
    ", a high - opr / low - abundance combination may indeed be another piece of evidence to show that the ne cloud is heavily influenced by the w28 snr , both directly through shock collision and shock heating , and indirectly from an enhanced ionisation rate .",
    "such a scenario would require modelling of gas - phase nh@xmath4 production and destruction beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we note that in our calculations , the nh@xmath4 abundance is proportional to the cs abundance assumed by @xcite , thus an alternative interpretation for our data towards this cloud is that the cs abundance is enhanced by a factor of @xmath2110 in the region , while the nh@xmath4 abundance remains average ( @xmath90 ) . certainly cs abundance can fluctuate due to freeze - out onto grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we reported on deep mapping observations towards the shocked molecular cloud north - east of w28 , with a focus on detecting multiple 3 inversion transitions .",
    "the ne cloud has a remarkable spatial match with the gamma - ray source hess j1801 - 233 , so constraints on the mass distribution are important for hadronic gamma - ray production models of the region , while the observed chemistry serves as an observational constraint on cr ionisation and propagation .",
    "spectral line observations are steps towards parameter constraints associated with the ne cloud of w28 .",
    "these observations revealed that the dense component of the ne cloud is much more extended than previously reported .",
    "this is the case for all the detected inversion transitions . towards the cloud ,",
    "strong , nh@xmath4(4,4 ) and nh@xmath4(6,6 ) emission suggest this is a region of high gas temperature . furthermore , new evidence for shocked gas is provided by -velocity dispersion maps that resolve a new 3 component on the w28 side of the ne cloud .",
    "gas parameter maps were derived from nh@xmath4 emission via a method that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and were checked against non - lte statistical equilibrium models .",
    "nh@xmath4 column densities on the order of 10@xmath69@xmath68 and temperatures in the range 35 - 60k were observed within the ne cloud of w28 .",
    "the ortho - para - nh@xmath4 ratio ( opr ) was investigated , revealing a subregion with an elevated opr ( @xmath02 ) , characteristic of regions where nh@xmath4 is liberated from dust - grain mantles . comparing our measurements with a previously - published cs - derived mass estimate ,",
    "no corresponding nh@xmath4 abundance enhancement was observed ( [ 3]/[h@xmath5]@xmath6 ) , possibly suggesting the existence of an nh@xmath4 destruction mechanism .",
    "more detailed modelling of gas - phase nh@xmath4 production and destruction may be required to investigate this result .",
    "future work to improve the angular resolution and sensitivity of tev gamma - ray images will allow a detailed comparison of the gamma - ray emission and cosmic ray target material ( the gas ) , while considering the time - dependent effect cosmic ray propagation may also allow the analysis of features in the gev to tev gamma - ray spectrum towards snrs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
