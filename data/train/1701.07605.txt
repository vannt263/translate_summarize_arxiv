    "reliability is a key issue in designing wireless communications , since the channels are vulnerable to distortions .",
    "reliability is typically improved by simultaneous error - correction coding and physical - layer design , with the tradeoff of decoding complexity and information rate .",
    "orthogonal lattice codes are a highly conventional physical - layer design in all types of wireless channels .",
    "such codes provide for fast vector decoding based on solving a closest - vector problem .",
    "in addition , the gray mapping from bit vectors to lattice vectors guarantees a beneficial conversion of vector decoding errors to bit decoding errors .",
    "thus , the fundamental question in physical - layer reliability is to find the orthogonal lattice , or equivalently , the rotation , that provides a low rate of vector decoding errors .",
    "algebraic rotations are known to provide a solution in rayleigh fading single - input single - output ( siso ) , see @xcite for a good overview , as well as in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels @xcite .",
    "the case is nevertheless not closed : research on future fifth generation ( 5 g ) communication networks calls for studying optimal rotations for the rician channel .",
    "namely , instead of the usual 700mhz2.6ghz , an extension to millimeter waves ( e.g. 28ghz ) is anticipated @xcite .",
    "using millimeter waves provides both advantages and challenges .",
    "using traditional spectrum allows for the transmission of data over a longer distance but at lower capacity , whereas millimeter wave offers greater bandwidth , but over shorter distances .",
    "however , the channel models for such new frequency spectra are not yet fully understood .",
    "for this reason , it is unclear at the moment what kind of modulation and encoding of the data will be most useful for energy efficiency and signal robustness .",
    "nevertheless , tentative studies @xcite show that the scale channel coefficients are rician distributed .    in this paper",
    ", we show that several alternative design approaches suggest the optimality of _ hadamard rotations _ in rician siso channels .",
    "we show experimentally that hadamard rotations outperform the algebraic rotations of @xcite and the cross - packing lattices of @xcite over the rician channel .",
    "the rician channel is indexed by a parameter @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the rayleigh channel and @xmath3 the gaussian channel .",
    "while the algebraic lattices offer better performance at @xmath4 , they are outperformed by the hadamard rotations already at small @xmath5 .",
    "we present results only for @xmath6 for the sake of compactness , but similar results were obtained for several @xmath5 .",
    "lattices from hadamard rotations has previously been proposed for certain fading channels in @xcite , and as an alternative to ofdm for optical channels in @xcite , to give a few applications .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that their surprisingly good performance in the rician case has not been noticed before .       in section [ sec : preli ] , we provide the necessary background on lattices , hadamard rotations , and the rician channel .",
    "the design approaches based on error probability estimates and sphere packings are presented in sections [ sec : hadamard][sec : sp ] , and approaches based on diamond packings and diversity estimates in section [ sec : connections ] .",
    "simulation results are provided in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "a _ lattice _ is a discrete additive subgroup of @xmath7 . we assume familiarity with the basic concepts related to lattices and lattice codes , and",
    "refer the unaccustomed reader to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we point out that we consistently work in the column vector convention .",
    "we are going to be interested in the following class of lattices .",
    "[ def : wr ] a full - rank lattice @xmath8 is _ well - rounded _ ( wr ) if its minimal vectors span @xmath7 .",
    "the minimal vectors of a wr lattice @xmath9 are not guaranteed to generate @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) . wr lattices are of interest here mainly due to their relation to the sphere - packing problem .",
    "namely , all local maxima of the sphere packing density and hence in particular the sphere - packing optimal lattices are well - rounded : in a non - wr lattice , one can shrink the orthogonal complement of the minimal vectors to obtain a lattice with same minimal norm but smaller volume .",
    "the following is a partial converse to this statement :    [ lemma : znwr ] let @xmath10 be a wr full lattice , scaled to unit volume .",
    "then , the sphere packing density of @xmath9 is minimized if and only if @xmath9 is a rotation of @xmath0 .",
    "any @xmath11 linearly independent minimal vectors of @xmath9 generate a wr sublattice @xmath12 whose sphere - packing density is smaller or equal to that of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , it suffices to prove the claim for the wr lattice @xmath12 generated by its minimal vectors .",
    "but the claim is then immediate from hadamard s inequality .",
    "a _ ( real ) hadamard matrix _ is a square matrix whose all entries are @xmath13 and whose column vectors are orthogonal .",
    "the orthogonality condition can be equivalently cast as @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 is an orthogonal matrix , called a _",
    "hadamard rotation_. hadamard matrices are conjectured to exist in all dimensions divisible by four , and known to exist in all such dimensions relevant for lattice coding purposes .",
    "the kronecker product of two hadamard matrices yields a third one .",
    "based on this fact , _",
    "sylvester s construction _ is the simplest way to obtain hadamard matrices in dimensions that are powers of two , defined inductively by @xmath16 we denote hadamard matrices by @xmath17 and hadamard rotations by @xmath18 , often working with @xmath17 to avoid normalization constants .",
    "we consider a single - input - single - output ( siso ) wireless channel .",
    "we assume perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver and no csi at the transmitter .",
    "such a channel is modeled by the real channel equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the transmitted and received vectors , respectively , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are mutually independent random vectors modeling fading and noise , respectively .",
    "we assume gaussian noise , @xmath24 , and an interleaved channel where the @xmath25 are i.i.d .",
    "our primary interest lies in rician distributed @xmath25 , modeling a fading with a line of sight and scattering routes .",
    "the strength of the line of sight is captured by the _ rician factor _ @xmath26 indexing the different rice distributions defined by the density @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the zeroth - order bessel function of first kind .",
    "the case @xmath2 is the well - studied rayleigh fading channel , while in the limit @xmath3 , @xmath25 becomes deterministically one and we obtain the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel .",
    "[ subsec : heuristics ]    in this section , we provide some motivating computations for the optimality of hadamard rotations in physical - layer designs .",
    "the design criteria rely on the @xmath25 having small variance , and thus being concentrated around their mean .",
    "this is in contrast with the rayleigh fading channel , in which deep fades ( some @xmath29 ) are a major cause of decoding errors .",
    "the two most conventional ways to design physical - layer reliability in fading channels are minimizing the pep bound or , in the awgn channel , maximizing the sphere - packing density of the lattice .",
    "we study analogous design approaches in channel models where deep fades are not the primary cause of decoding errors , such as the rician channel .",
    "] , by studying the pairwise error probability ( pep ) estimate and the sphere - packing at a near - average fade .",
    "we find an agreement of the two approaches , both suggesting the optimality of hadamard rotations .",
    "the standard pep bound states that the probability @xmath30 of a vector decoding error is bounded by @xmath31 where @xmath9 is the code lattice , @xmath32 the noise variance , and the expectation is over @xmath33 . in the deep - fade dominated rayleigh fading channel ,",
    "this expectation is analyzed by fixing the distribution of the fading @xmath25 and expanding around @xmath34 . to study a noise dominated channel ,",
    "let us fix the noise @xmath32 and `` expand around @xmath35 ''",

    "first , the average norm of a given lattice vector @xmath47 is after fading @xmath38 .",
    "this tells us to maximize the packing radius of @xmath9 , but does not differentiate between rotations of @xmath9 .",
    "next , the random norms @xmath48 , especially the shortest ones , should be stabilized around their expectation @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "hence , we should minimize the variance @xmath50   )   = \\frac{{\\mathrm{var}}(h_i^2)}{{\\mathbb{e}}[h_i^2]^2 } \\frac{\\vert \\mathbf{t }   \\vert_4 ^ 4}{\\vert \\mathbf{t }   \\vert_2 ^ 4}.\\ ] ] the conclusions are identical to those reached from the criteria derived from the pep ; specifically , if @xmath9 is a rotation of @xmath0 and @xmath51 a minimal vector of @xmath9 , then the above quantity will be minimized exactly when it is a hadamard rotation .",
    "more generally , we could expand the class of lattices we are interested in to include non - orthogonal lattices .",
    "in particular , there exist many well - rounded lattices ( which necessarily have good sphere packings ) all of whose minimal vectors are parallel to @xmath52^t $ ] . for example , the body - centered cubic lattice in @xmath53 , generated by the vectors @xmath54^t $ ] , @xmath55^t $ ] , and @xmath56^t $ ] , or its tensor product with any hadamard lattice .",
    "in this section , we provide a probabilistic estimate for the sphere - packing density of a hadamard rotated unit lattice after fading .",
    "we work with the unnormalized hadamard matrices @xmath57 , and denote the lattices of interest by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "notice that the natural generators of the faded lattice @xmath60 are of the form @xmath61^t$ ] .",
    "if they are minimal vectors of @xmath60 , then @xmath60 is well - rounded and , by lemma [ lemma : znwr ] , @xmath60 has a good sphere packing . in this section ,",
    "we compute the probability of this event in low dimensions .",
    "[ lemma : shortest vectors ] for any realization of @xmath33 , there is a minimal vector @xmath62 of the faded lattice @xmath60 , where the integer lattice coordinates @xmath63 either satisfy @xmath64 , or @xmath65 is a row of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath66 be the @xmath67 row of @xmath17 , and @xmath63 some arbitrary lattice coordinates .",
    "we compare the lengths of the lattice @xmath60 vectors @xmath68 and @xmath62 .",
    "first , @xmath69 , so for some @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 next , denote @xmath72 and note that @xmath73 where the last step used the fact that @xmath15 is a rotation matrix",
    ". now @xmath62 must satisfy @xmath64 to be shorter than @xmath68 .",
    "[ cor : finite dimensions ] let us denote by @xmath74 the event that the natural generators @xmath75 of a faded hadamard lattices @xmath59 are minimal vectors .",
    "then , @xmath76 is given by integrating the joint density of @xmath77 over a cone .",
    "for fixed dimension , the previous lemma gives finitely many lattice coordinates @xmath65 that can yield minimal vectors .",
    "then , @xmath78 are minimal vectors if and only if all such @xmath65 satisfy @xmath79 a linear inequality in @xmath80 .",
    "this corollary allows for numerical computations , as illustrated in figure [ fig : non wr proba ] .",
    "in particular , when @xmath25 are taken rician with parameter @xmath5 , the probability @xmath81 of @xmath60 not being wr decays exponentially in @xmath5 . in four dimensions ,",
    "the exponential decay is faster than in two .",
    "this leads to two conclusions .",
    "first , especially in larger dimensions , one can expect hadamard rotations to perform well in rician channels where @xmath5 is sufficiently away from zero .",
    "second , the decoding errors in such a setup mainly occur due to large noise , rather than deep fades .",
    "this supports the standing assumption of `` noise - dominated errors '' in the design approach suggesting hadamard rotations in section [ subsec : heuristics ] .",
    "aside from the above criteria derived from the pep and sphere packing density , there have recently been more subtle design criteria introduced for lattice codes over fading channels , wherein deep fades are not the primary cause of errors .",
    "these include the cross - packing density @xcite and local diversity @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present results which study how well hadamard rotations of @xmath0 satisfy these design criteria .",
    "recently , @xcite designed lattices for rician channels by maximizing their _ cross - packing _ density ( equivalently , maximizing cross - packing radius ) , where the crosses consist of axis - aligned line segments .",
    "this was motivated by approximating the shape of a contour surfaces of the terms in the rician pep estimate by a cross polyomino , i.e.  an appropriately thickened cross .",
    "analogously , approximating the shape of the contour surfaces by the convex hulls of the @xmath11-dimensional crosses , also known as @xmath82 norm balls or diamonds , one ends up designing lattices based on their diamond packing density .",
    "we find that the hadamard rotations maximize the diamond packing density of the rotated @xmath0 lattices .",
    "let @xmath83 be a rotation matrix .",
    "then , the minimal @xmath82 norm of the rotated @xmath0 lattice @xmath84 satisfies @xmath85 with equality if and only if @xmath86 is a hadamard rotation .    to prove the inequality ,",
    "let @xmath87 be any elementary basis vector .",
    "take @xmath88 a rotated basis vector .",
    "recall now the relation of @xmath43 and @xmath82 norms on @xmath7 : @xmath89 with equality if and only if @xmath51 is parallel to @xmath90^t$ ] .",
    "this implies that @xmath85 and the equality is possibly reached only if @xmath86 is hadamard .    to prove that the inequality is sharp for hadamard rotations , notice that @xmath91 if and only if @xmath92 for some sign vector @xmath93^t$ ] .",
    "now , let @xmath51 be any nonzero vector of a hadamard rotated lattice @xmath94 , and let @xmath95 be a basis vector of the lattice @xmath94",
    "( i.e. , a column of @xmath18 ) with a nonzero ( integer ) coefficient in @xmath96 .",
    "choosing @xmath97 , the orthogonality of the hadamard basis implies @xmath98 so indeed @xmath99 for all nonzero @xmath96 .      in @xcite the design of reliable lattices in low signal - to - ratio ( snr ) rayleigh fading channels",
    "was considered , and the authors deduced that hadamard rotations are optimal within a certain one - parameter lie group of rotations .",
    "they explained the appearance hadamard rotations , which contrary to conventional algebraic rotations are not fully diverse , by _ local diversity _ of hadamard lattices , _",
    "i.e. _ , a tradeoff between diversity and length of the lattice vectors .",
    "we prove the following sharp local diversity estimate for hadamard rotations .",
    "[ lem : local diversity ] let @xmath100 be a hadamard rotation and let @xmath101 be of diversity @xmath102 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath106 as desired .",
    "we now present simulation results to confirm our previous findings .",
    "the key parameters for our simulations are the dimension @xmath11 of the signal constellation and its order @xmath107 per dimension ( so that the number of constellation points is @xmath108 ) , the parameter @xmath5 of the rician distribution , and the volume - to - noise ratio ( vnr ) which defines the variance of the noise @xmath109 by the formula @xmath110 . in simulations for @xmath111",

    "then , we center such a region by setting @xmath119 . finally , our signal constellation @xmath116 is a image of @xmath120 under the generator matrix , @xmath121 .",
    "the channel simulations were based on first generating a uniform random constellation vector @xmath122 , then generating the rician fading and gaussian noise vectors of the channel equation to obtain the received vector @xmath123 , and finally solving the closest vector problem @xmath124 .",

    "let us compare the hadamard rotations against these lattices ( normalized to unit volume ) .",
