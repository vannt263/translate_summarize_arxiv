    "the shell structure , which is typically manifested in the magic numbers , is one of the fundamental concepts in the nuclear structure physics .",
    "the shell structure of nuclei is of importance also in astrophysics ; _",
    "e.g. _ it provides the waiting point of the @xmath10- and @xmath11-processes .",
    "as abundant experimental data have been obtained in unstable nuclei , it has been clarified  @xcite that the shell structure may depend on @xmath1 or @xmath12 more strongly than expected from most conventional theories . as well as the disappearance of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 magic numbers , the new magic numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "have been indicated in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this discovery has stimulated to reexamine and refine theories with respect to the nuclear shell structure .",
    "the new experimental facilities  @xcite are expected to access heavier unstable nuclei in coming years .",
    "it is desirable to give predictions on the shell structure from the refined theories , which could be a good guidance to new experiments and will eventually be tested by them .    concerning the @xmath1 or @xmath12 dependence of the shell structure ( which is sometimes called `` shell evolution '' ) ,",
    "two mechanisms have been argued .",
    "the absent or low centrifugal barrier in low-@xmath17 orbits may influence the shell structure near the neutron drip line  @xcite .",
    "whereas the @xmath13 magic number is eroded because of this mechanism , there has been no clear evidence for new magic numbers owing directly to the loose binding .",
    "since the nuclear shell structure is formed under the average field composed of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction , the effective @xmath0 interaction may also affect the shell structure .",
    "in particular , it has been pointed out that the tensor force plays a significant role in the @xmath1 or @xmath12 dependence of the shell structure  @xcite . for full understanding of the shell structure in unstable nuclei",
    ", it will be necessary to take both possibilities into account .    the mean - field ( mf ) theories provide us with a good tool to study the nuclear shell structure from the nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "while it is yet difficult to describe structure of medium- to heavy - mass nuclei with the fully microscopic @xmath0 interaction to good accuracy , the author has recently developed semi - realistic @xmath0 interactions  @xcite , in which the michigan 3-range yukawa ( m3y ) interaction  @xcite is modified so as to reproduce basic observed properties such as the saturation and the @xmath18 splitting .",
    "the longest - range part of the central channels is maintained to be the central force in the one - pion exchange potential @xmath19 .",
    "the tensor channels in the m3y - paris interaction  @xcite are contained in the parameter - set m3y - p5@xmath20 without any change . since the significant part of the tensor force comes from the pions , m3y - p5@xmath20 takes well account of the leading - order effects of the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the tensor channels are dropped in the set m3y - p4@xmath20 , which is useful to investigate role of the tensor force .",
    "shell structure of the neutron - rich ca and ni nuclei is an interesting topic .",
    "the @xmath2 new magic number has been indicated by the experiments in @xmath4ca  @xcite .",
    "a shell model calculation suggests that magic nature is stronger in @xmath21 than in @xmath2  @xcite because of the tensor force , although the data on @xmath22ti show no signature of the @xmath21 magicity  @xcite . whereas @xmath3 behaves like a magic number in @xmath6ni  @xcite , contradictory predictions have been given for @xmath5ca  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 magicity has been argued in @xmath7ni  @xcite .",
    "it could also be interesting whether a new magic or submagic number exists beyond @xmath24 in the ni isotopes . in this communication",
    "we shall investigate shell structure of the neutron - rich ca and ni nuclei by applying the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations with the semi - realistic @xmath0 interactions .",

    "the density - dependent contact force @xmath43 is introduced to realize the saturation .",
    "the parameter - sets m3y - p4@xmath20 and p5@xmath20 are presented in ref .",
    "we note again that m3y - p4@xmath20 contains @xmath19 but with assuming @xmath44 , while both @xmath19 and @xmath45 of the m3y - paris interaction are untouched in m3y - p5@xmath20 . for comparison",
    ", we use the d1s parameter - set  @xcite of the gogny interaction , in which @xmath46 , the contact form for @xmath47 , and @xmath44 are adopted .",
    "it is reasonably assumed that the spherical symmetry holds in the neutron - rich ca and ni nuclei .",
    "although the quadrupole deformation can not always be discarded for precise studies , we focus on the spherical shell structure in this communication , which is crucial to understand structure of these nuclei . the spherical hf calculations are implemented by using the gaussian expansion method  @xcite and adopting the hamiltonian @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the effective nuclear hamiltonian , the coulomb interaction and the center - of - mass hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "the exchange term of @xmath50 is treated exactly .",
    "both the one- and the two - body terms of @xmath51 are subtracted before iteration .",
    "it is noted that , although the d1s interaction does not contain @xmath19 and @xmath45 explicitly , a part of their contribution is incorporated in the other channels in an effective manner .",
    "the same holds for m3y - p4@xmath20 that lacks @xmath45 .",
    "it has still been recognized  @xcite that the @xmath1 or @xmath12 dependence of the shell structure is difficult to be described without explicit inclusion of @xmath19 and @xmath45 .",
    "for the ca and ni nuclei , the main correlations beyond the spherical hf solution should be the neutron pairing .",
    "therefore the pair energy is a good measure for the neutron shell closure .",

    "a notable point is that @xmath54 significantly depends on the interactions in the ca isotopes , but not in the ni isotopes .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the neutron shell structure above @xmath24 in the highly neutron - rich ni isotopes is different from the @xmath55 stable region .",

    "[ fig : n32_dspe ] ]    with the m3y - p5@xmath20 interaction we obtain considerable @xmath1-dependence in @xmath67 .",
    "this is already recognized by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : z20_nspe ] and [ fig : z28_nspe ] .",
    "this @xmath1-dependence originates in @xmath19  @xcite and @xmath45  @xcite , both of which act attractively on @xmath71 as @xmath72 is occupied , via the mechanism discussed in refs .",
    "note that , though the same mechanism is present also for @xmath73 , the effects are much smaller and do not lead to significant @xmath1 dependence .",
    "not including these parts explicitly , the d1s interaction does not provide strong @xmath1-dependence in @xmath69 .",
    "having @xmath19 but not @xmath45 , m3y - p4@xmath20 gives moderate @xmath1-dependence .",
    "the shell gaps in @xmath4ca are comparable among all the interactions .",
    "the pair energies shown in refs .",
    "@xcite confirm that @xmath4ca is nearly a doubly - magic nucleus , as is consistent with the measured @xmath74 value  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the experimental data in @xmath5ni show no enhancement of @xmath74  @xcite , suggesting meltdown of the @xmath2 magicity .",
    "the effects of the tensor force on the mean fields , together with those of @xmath19 , well account for the @xmath1-dependence of the @xmath2 magicity .",
    "unlike the @xmath2 shell gap , the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 is not remarkable at @xmath77 in the present calculations . as a result @xmath78ca has a certain amount of the pair excitation , as shown in ref .",
    "it is emphasized that this consequence is obtained even with m3y - p5@xmath20 that includes reasonably strong tensor force .",
    "thus the @xmath21 magicity can not be concluded only from the tensor force , and influence of the other parts of the interaction ( _ e.g. _ the central channels ) on @xmath79 is important as well .      as viewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the magic or submagic nature of @xmath3 predicted by the mf calculations significantly depends on the input effective interactions .",
    "while the pair excitation is hindered both in @xmath6ni and @xmath5ca if we use sly4 , d1s or m3y - p4@xmath20 , there is no signature of the @xmath3 magicity with skm@xmath52 .",
    "all of these interactions do not contain the explicit tensor force .",
    "if we apply m3y - p5@xmath20 that contains realistic tensor force , the pair excitation is highly suppressed in @xmath6ni but not in @xmath5ca .",

    "[ fig : n40_dspe ] ]    as mentioned above , the @xmath83 values obtained with d1s , m3y - p4@xmath20 and skm@xmath52 do not strongly depend on @xmath1 .",
    "it has experimentally been suggested that @xmath6ni looks like a doubly magic nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the d1s interaction , which gives strongly suppressed pairing , describes @xmath74 and @xmath87 of @xmath6ni to good accuracy within the quasiparticle version of the random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite .",
    "the sizable pair excitation with skm@xmath52 is ascribed to the small @xmath83 .",
    "it would be difficult to reproduce the experimental data on @xmath74 and @xmath87 in @xmath6ni with this small @xmath83 .",
    "if we use m3y - p5@xmath20 that includes realistic tensor force , the @xmath3 shell gap is comparable to those with d1s and m3y - p4@xmath20 in @xmath6ni , but @xmath83 significantly depends on @xmath1 .",

    "contribution of @xmath19 is not important in this case .",
    "the @xmath3 shell gap comes minimum at @xmath77 , and this leads to sizable pair excitation in @xmath5ca  @xcite .",
    "as long as we rely on the shell gap in @xmath6ni , it is likely that the @xmath3 magicity is significantly broken in @xmath5ca , since the tensor force certainly exists in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "this prediction will be tested by future experiments on systematics of the binding energies and/or of the first excited states",
    ".    there have been arguments on the @xmath3 magicity in @xmath6ni  @xcite .",
    "although the pair energy is quite small , the neutrons are still in the superfluid phase in the hfb results of @xmath6ni , with any of d1s , m3y - p4@xmath20 and m3y - p5@xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the experimental data show that the magicity is lost quickly as @xmath1 departs from @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "this situation reminds us of the protons in @xmath89gd  @xcite , and it could be more reasonable to call @xmath3 around @xmath6ni a _ submagic _ number rather than a new magic number .",
    "a small shell gap may induce quadrupole deformation .",
    "the quadrupole deformation in the @xmath3 isotones , as is known for @xmath90zr , has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using the d1s interaction .",
    "though beyond the scope of this paper , it will be of interest to study deformation effects with the semi - realistic interactions .      in the present mf calculations ,",
    "the magic number @xmath24 is maintained both for @xmath91ca and @xmath7ni , irrespective of the effective interactions .",
    "the shell gap between @xmath80 and the upper levels is large enough to prevent the neutrons from being excited in the hfb calculations .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the @xmath23 magic nature could be eroded in @xmath7ni , because @xmath92 comes down via the attraction from the protons occupying @xmath72 . in the hf calculation with m3y - p5@xmath20 , such attraction is realized because the tensor force is included , and @xmath92 becomes the lowest unoccupied proton orbit .",
    "however , it is not sufficient to violate the @xmath23 shell gap , which amounts to @xmath93 , via the pair excitation . since the magic nature",
    "is usually linked to properties of the first excited state , we present the values of @xmath74 and @xmath87 predicted by the hf+rpa calculations in table  [ tab : ni78 - 2 + ] . as well as those of d1s and",

    "[ tab : ni78 - 2 + ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      references  @xcite show that the pair correlation is greatly suppressed in @xmath9ni , suggesting the submagic nature of @xmath8 near the neutron drip line . to examine the neutron shell structure around @xmath8 , @xmath95 is depicted for @xmath96 and @xmath58 in fig .  [",

    "basically the interval between @xmath57 and @xmath58 corresponds to the @xmath8 shell gap .",

    "[ fig : z20_nspe ] for conventions of colors .",
    "[ fig : n58_dspe ] ]    in this region we do not find remarkable interaction - dependence in the neutron shell structure . as approaching the neutron drip line ( _ i.e. _ for decreasing @xmath1 ) , the lower-@xmath17 orbit has relatively lower energy because its wave function feels the weaker centrifugal repulsion and thereby easily extends in the coordinate space .",
    "the main correlation which may break the @xmath8 shell gap is the pair excitation out of @xmath100 to @xmath98 .",
    "the coupling between these two orbits via the pairing is not strong , primarily because their degeneracy ( @xmath101 ) is small .",
    "indeed , the coupling matrix element @xmath102 is @xmath103 if evaluated by the m3y - p5@xmath20 interaction , appreciably smaller than @xmath104\\approx 3\\,\\mathrm{mev}$ ] .",
    "thus , the loose binding , assisted by the weak coupling , leads to the @xmath8 submagic nature in @xmath9ni , although the pair excitation remains within the hfb regime .",
    "because the weak coupling plays a certain role , the submagic number @xmath8 at @xmath9ni does not imply high @xmath74 .",
    "on the other hand , it could be manifested by suppressed @xmath94 . the @xmath105 state is not easily handled in numerical calculations , because it is located just above the neutron threshold .",

    "specific ingredients of the effective interaction , particularly the tensor force , could play a crucial role .",
    "the magic nature of @xmath2 around @xmath4ca and the non - magic nature around @xmath5ni can be accounted for by the tensor force as well as by the central part of the one - pion exchange potential ; _ i.e. _ the leading order effects of the chiral symmetry breaking . on the other hand , the present mean - field study does not support the @xmath21 magic number .",
    "the tensor force gives rise to @xmath1 dependence of the shell structure around @xmath3 . whereas the submagic nature of @xmath3 in @xmath6ni has been observed and is described by many effective interactions except skm@xmath52 , the submagic nature is likely destroyed in @xmath5ca because of the @xmath1 dependence in the shell structure produced by the tensor force .",
    "although it has been pointed out that the loose binding could lead to new magic numbers in drip - line nuclei , no clear evidence has been found so far .",
    "we point out that @xmath8 will be submagic in @xmath9ni , owing to the lower centrifugal barrier in the lower @xmath17 orbits , together with the weak pair coupling .",
    "this submagic nature may be connected to small @xmath87 , but not to high @xmath74 .    in the present work we have constrained ourselves to the spherical mf calculations , which are useful to understand variation of the structure in the ca to ni nuclei in a simple manner .",
