    "turbulent flows in the atmosphere combined with stratified temperatures provoke turbulent fluctuations of the refractive index of air , commonly known as optical turbulence .",
    "the intensity of such fluctuations is determined by the second order structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the altitude , is of major importance for the development of novel adaptive optical ( ao ) systems that overcome the angular - resolution degradation introduced by optical turbulence .",
    "the statistical study of optical turbulence profiles is also crucial for the characterization of sites where next generation of optical telescopes are to be installed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one important limitation of ao systems that are designed to account for phase fluctuations generated all along the atmosphere is the tiny field of view over which the wavefront is corrected .",
    "one way to improve image quality over a wide field of view is to correct only the wavefront perturbations that come from turbulent layers close to the ground .",
    "this method is known as ground - layer adaptive optics ( glao ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the compensation of lower - altitude turbulent - layers provides wider corrected fields of view @xcite and turbulence close to the ground is generally the most intense ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to develop a glao system for a given site",
    ", it is required to have as much knowledge as possible about the vertical distribution of optical turbulence in the ground layer ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "this requires measurements of @xmath1 with very high altitude - resolution close to the ground .",
    "scintillation detection and ranging ( scidar ) has extensively been used for @xmath0 profiling since its invention by @xcite . the generalised version of the scidar made it possible to detect turbulence near the ground @xcite .",
    "a more recent implementation of the generalized scidar on a 40-cm telescope that used a widely - separated double star as a light source and an electron multiplying charge coupled device ( emccd ) as the detector , gave place to the low layer scidar ( lolas ) @xcite .",
    "the lolas prototype was used to characterize the ground - layer turbulence at mauna kea , together with a slope detection and ranging instrument @xcite .",
    "although this several - years campaign gave definitive results , the experience showed that a number of aspects on the prototype lolas could be improved in order to optimize data acquisition . in this paper",
    "we describe the development and tests of the second generation low layer scidar ( lolas-2 ) .",
    "a few instruments based on optical methods have been developed to measure @xmath1 profiles with the required vertical resolution close to the ground .",
    "for example , the surface - layer slope detection and ranging ( sl - slodar ) @xcite makes use of two shack - hartmann wavefront sensors , each looking at one component of a widely - separated double star .",
    "the slope of the wavefronts coming from each star is measured on 5-cm square subapertures whereas lolas-2 measures scintillation on square elements of 1-cm side approximately , which makes the sl - slodar five times more sensitive than the lolas-2 for equal integration times or five times faster for equal number of photons per element . on the other hand , if the instruments were using the same double star separation , lolas-2 provides 5 times better altitude resolution . a similar concept that also uses a double star but measures the scintillation from each component on two cameras",
    "was implemented in the stereo - scidar by @xcite .",
    "the lunar scintillometer , which consists of an array of photodiodes that measure scintillation from the moon , has been used to obtain high altitude - resolution turbulence profiles near the ground @xcite .",
    "@xcite use a generalized scidar to distinguish layers at very similar altitudes but moving at different velocities .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : ",
    "[ sec : method ] gives an overview of the lolas method . in ",
    "[ sec : lolasprototype ] we briefly describe the prototype version of the instrument and in   [ sec : lolas2 ] the second generation of the instrument is presented .",
    "tests on the instrument performances and some measurements are shown in ",
    "[ sec : instrumenttest ] and   [ sec : profiles ] .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the low layer scidar is based on the principle of the generalized scintillation detection and ranging ( g - scidar ) technique @xcite . in this section",
    ", we present a brief overview of the lolas method , since a complete description can be found in @xcite .",
    "the g - scidar principle can be summarized as follows : double - star scintillation patterns are recorded on short exposure - time images on a virtual plane located a distance @xmath3 from the telescope pupil . in g - scidar experiments",
    "this virtual plane is located below the telescope pupil , thus @xmath4 . a schematic view of the optical setup is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : scidar1 ] .",
    "each image consists of a randomly distributed intensity pattern .",
    "the autocovariance of this stochastic illumination is obtained by computing the spatial normalized autocorrelation of each image and averaging those autocorrelations over thousands of statistically independent image samples .",
    "each layer of optical turbulence contributes to the resulting scintillation autocovariance with three covariance peaks : one centred at the autocovariance origin and two others , identical to each other , separated from the origin by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 denotes the angular separation of the double star and @xmath2 the layer altitude above the ground .",
    "knowing @xmath7 and the conjugation altitude @xmath3 , the experimental determination of @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) leads to an estimate of the layer altitude @xmath2 .",
    "the measured autocovariance peaks @xmath10 are proportional to the optical turbulence strength at altitude @xmath2 , @xmath11 , and to the scintillation autocovariance function @xmath12 . in the realistic case of multiple layers ,",
    "the response of each layer adds up to the measured autocovariance , resulting in eq .  1 of @xcite .",
    "this equation consists of an integral with respect the altitude @xmath2 that is similar to a convolution , except that the kernel @xmath12 depends on the integration variable .",
    "one needs to invert this integral equation to retrieve @xmath11 . due to its similarity with a convolution integral",
    ", we developed an algorithm based on the clean method , but in which the kernel is recalculated for each different value of @xmath2 .",
    "our modified clean algorithm is based on that reported by @xcite . as explained by @xcite , the achievable altitude resolution using the modified clean method , when the target is at the zenith is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wavelength and @xmath15 . when the star is located at an elevation angle @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    "is decreased by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "we take @xmath19 , which corresponds to the maximum sensitivity of our detector . for a telescope having an aperture @xmath20 , the maximum altitude for which the @xmath21 value can be measured is given by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the low layer scidar concept consists of putting into practice a g - scidar on a dedicated portable telescope , using widely separated double stars as light sources . as can be seen from the above expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath23 , the wider the separation , the better the altitude resolution but the shorter the maximum altitude .",
    "lolas was designed to use a 40-cm telescope , an emccd to improve sensitivity and a real - time computation of the scintillation autocovariance .",
    "sections [ sec : lolasprototype ] and [ sec : lolas2 ] describe the prototype lolas version and the second generation instrument , respectively .",
    "the instrumental setup of lolas has been widely explained elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we present a summary of the most important instrumental characteristics .",
    "figure [ fig : prololas ] shows a schematic view of the prototype lolas .",
    "the scintillation images are obtained with a schmidt - cassegrain telescope of focal ratio f/10 and diameter @xmath24  cm and installed on an equatorial mount , manufactured by meade .",
    "the optics consists of two achromatic lenses of 50  mm focal - length . with this optical arrangement ,",
    "the virtual analysis plane is located 1.94  km below the pupil .",
    "the diameter of the pupil image on the detector is @xmath25  mm . the scintillation images are captured by an emccd camera ( andor ixon ) with @xmath26 square pixels of @xmath27 .",
    "the frames are binned 2 @xmath28 2 , and the active zone is limited to an array of @xmath29 binned pixels .",
    "the exposure time of each frame ranges from 3 to 10 ms , depending on the wind conditions .",
    "the typical number of images to obtain one autocovariance is set to 30000 .",
    "the emccd camera is mounted on a base that is attached to the rear of the telescope ( see fig . [",
    "fig : prololas ] ) . the same equipment , but with different optics , is used to form the slodar instrument .",
    "to switch between each instrument with the required positioning accuracy , a manual exchange mechanism was installed in front of the camera .      as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : instlolas ] , lolas-2 uses a ritchey - chrtien open telescope of focal ratio f/9 and diameter @xmath24  cm , manufactured by rc optical systems , a german equatorial mount ( 1200gto ) manufactured by astro - physics , an emccd camera ( andor ixon ) to acquire scintillation images and a sbig st-402me camera for the finder telescope .",
    "one advantage of using a ritchey - chrtien telescope is that when the position of the focal plane is changed , the effective focal length of the telescope remains unchanged .",
    "our rc optical systems telescope is equipped with a system that maintains the focus by monitoring the secondary mirror position in closed loop at a frequency of 6 khz , reaching an accuracy in the secondary mirror and the focus positions of 0.6 and 25.4 @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this control system is part of the telescope .",
    "in addition , the fact that the telescope is open prevents air at different temperatures to get trapped inside the tube in a turbulent convective flow , which would add an instrumental bias to the @xmath21 measurements at ground level .",
    "this was the case with the prototype lolas .",
    "removal of the spurious turbulence from the measurements was performed in a post - processing procedure using the method described by @xcite , as reported by @xcite . in lolas-2 , this post - processing step is avoided , making the data reduction faster and simpler .    concerning the mount , lolas-2 incorporates a german - type mount that reduces considerably the lever arm between the equatorial and declination axis .",
    "moreover , the astro - physics mount has a higher stiffness and the worm gear accuracy is significantly better , compared to those of the meade mount .",
    "the prototype version uses the optics of the telescope and achromatic doublets to define the spatial sampling and conjugation distance @xmath31 below the pupil .",
    "the second generation instrument was developed so as to dispense the use of the achromatic doublets and the exchange mechanism .",
    "it only uses the telescope optics , making it a simpler and more robust instrument .",
    "the beam is no longer collimated , like in the prototype version .",
    "the emcdd is placed directly a distance @xmath32 before the telescope focal plane .",
    "distance @xmath32 is chosen such that the detector plane is made the conjugate of the a virtual plane located a distance @xmath3 below the telescope pupil ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : widefig2]_a _ ) and the spatial sampling on this plane is well - suited to sample the scintillation speckles ( see fig . [",
    "fig : widefig2]_b _ ) . using the thin lens equation",
    ", it can easily be shown that @xmath3 is related to @xmath32 by the following expression : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the focal length of the telescope .",
    "for the spatial sampling , fig .",
    "[ fig : widefig2]_b _ illustrates the demagnification relation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the typical size of the smallest scintillation speckles on the pupil and @xmath37 is its corresponding size on the detector plane .",
    "@xcite showed that the full width at half maximum of the autocovariance of the scintillation produced at altitude @xmath2 is given by @xmath38 this is , the typical size of the smallest speckle is @xmath39 . solving eq .",
    "[ ec : conservspeck ] for @xmath37 and replacing the above expression for @xmath36 gives : @xmath40 for ground - level turbulence to be detectable , @xmath3 must be smaller than @xmath41   m. a good spatial sampling of the scintillation speckles is obtained when @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the size of the elementary sampling element .",
    "we chose to acquire images with the camera pixels binned @xmath44 . in that case , @xmath45 .",
    "the camera pixel size is @xmath46 .",
    "table [ tab : comparisonl ] gives values of different parameters of interest for different values of @xmath32 .",
    "it can be seen that a good compromise is obtained when the detector is located a distance @xmath47   mm before the telescope focal plane , as the conjugation distance is large enough ( @xmath48   m ) and the number of spatial samples per smallest speckle width is 1.8 , which is very close to 2 , the nyquist criterion .",
    "even though the undersampling is small , it is taken into account in the kernel of the inversion process that calculates @xmath0 profiles from the measured autocovariances .    as a consequence of this analysis ,",
    "the value for @xmath32 is set to 11 mm in lolas-2 . for this value of @xmath32",
    ", the distance separating two contiguous binned pixels corresponds to an angular separation of @xmath49 .",
    "in this section we present results concerning the focus stability and guiding performance obtained the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir ( oan - spm ) , baja california , mexico .",
    "the data was obtained on the nights of 2013 june 15 , 16 and 17 .",
    "table [ tab : usedstars ] summarises the pertinent characteristics of the double - star targets used .",
    "focus stability is extremely important to maintain the spatial sampling and conjugation altitude along data acquisition .",
    "a variation of the telescope focus position translates into a variation of the pupil image diameter @xmath50 on the detector .",
    "this diameter is continuously monitored during the standard data acquisition of the instrument .",
    "images are sent by the emccd to the computer in packets of 200 consecutive 256x80 pixels frames . in each frame , the image is centred ( as explained in ",
    "[ sec : guiding ] ) and then co - added to form a mean image made of 200 frames .",
    "the pupil diameters are calculated from this mean image as follows ( see fig . [",
    "fig : imagemean ] ) : the mean image is integrated along columns to form a row of the accumulated values .",
    "the width at half maximum of the left and right pupils on the accumulated - values row determines their diameter in number of pixels @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .    to estimate the focus stability ,",
    "the diameter of each pupil was monitored during several hours on three nights , using the same double star as source .",
    "the total number of pupil size measurements was 4566 .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the measured diameters are @xmath53 and @xmath54 pixels .",
    "the average of the temperature and its variation for each night was @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 celcius degrees , according to the weather station at spm .",
    "the obtained standard deviations can be due to uncertainties in the estimation procedure and/or to actual physical variation in the focus or camera positions .",
    "if we consider the latter to be the cause of the measured diameter fluctuations , the consequence of the deviation of 0.40 pixels in pupil diameter implies a variation of 13 m in altitude conjugation and 0.32 @xmath58 m in the sampling element size on the detector , approximately , which are tolerable values .",
    "this result suggests that the use of an auto - focus algorithm , which was developed for the prototype lolas , could be avoided in the second generation instrument , although more tests under varying temperature conditions should be performed .      maintaining a constant position of the pupil images on",
    "the emccd is important to correctly compute the mean image , the autocorrelation of which is used to normalize the mean autocorrelation of scintillation images , so obtaining the scintillation autocovariance . on wind conditions commonly encountered in astronomical observatories , telescope shake may cause pupil images to move on the detector .",
    "this eventual image wander is corrected for by centering the image in every single frame captured by the detector .",
    "the guiding performance of the telescope mount is important to keep pupil images within the useful window of the emccd during data acquisition that may last hours .",
    "the image position on the active area of the emccd is determined as follows : we construct an artificial reference image @xmath59 formed by two disks of 38 pixels in diameter each and separated from each other by the same distance as the observed double star .",
    "we compute the cross - correlation @xmath60 of the current image @xmath61 with @xmath59 .",
    "the position of the pupil images @xmath62 in @xmath61 is set as the position of the maximum value of @xmath60 with respect the frame centre .    in standard operation of lolas-2 ,",
    "image positions are not saved on disk . to test the guiding performance and image stability we recorded image positions @xmath62 during several observations .",
    "the @xmath62 coordinates on the emccd were rotated according to the double - star position angle to obtain image positions in right ascension ( @xmath63 ) and declination ( @xmath64 ) coordinates system .",
    "this allows us to investigate separately the guiding and stability behaviour on the two rotation axis of the mount",
    ". figures  [ fig : offset2013 - 1 ] and  [ fig : offset2013 - 2 ] show two examples . for the results obtained on 2013 june 17 ut ( fig .",
    "[ fig : offset2013 - 1 ] ) wind was blowing from the south - west with mean speed of 15.5 km h@xmath65 and a maximum value of 18.0 km h@xmath65 .",
    "the image positions remained very stable apart from a slow continuous drift on @xmath64 and a slow oscillation in @xmath63 , presumably due to an inexact alignment of the mount and a periodic error on the right - ascension gear - mechanism , respectively . on 2013",
    "june 15 ut wind was less benevolent , blowing from the west at a mean speed of 26.6 km h@xmath65 with gusts reaching 40 km h@xmath65 .",
    "figure  [ fig : offset2013 - 2 ] shows an example of that night .",
    "even though images were moving significantly , the mean position remained constant and pupil images remained within the emccd working window , which enabled turbulence profiles to be measured in these conditions .    to investigate further the dependence of image jitter on prevailing wind speed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : jitter - wind ] it is shown a plot of the standard deviation of image position as a function of wind speed .",
    "for each of the available 4566 frame - packets , the standard deviation @xmath66 of the image position was calculated .",
    "the frame rate within each packet is 13-ms per frame .",
    "the wind conditions that prevailed at the time of each measurement were obtained from the database of the oan - spm weather station .",
    "bar extremities on fig .",
    "[ fig : jitter - wind ] indicate the 25 and 75 percentiles of the @xmath66 values for a given wind speed .",
    "as expected , strong winds produce large image jitter , but surprisingly , @xmath66 values remain lower than @xmath67 for wind speeds lower than 30  @xmath68 . even though the force exerted by the wind on the telescope is proportional to the wind speed ,",
    "the mount and telescope structures move significantly only if the wind speed exceeds a certain value that seems to lie between 30 and 35  @xmath68 .",
    "the telescope and mount stiffness , together with the guiding performance have proven to suffice for conducting observations in moderate to strong wind conditions , without the need of an auto guiding procedure like in the prototype lolas .",
    "in this section we present a few examples of measured scintillation autocorrelations and corresponding turbulence profiles .",
    "the first results of lolas-2 were obtained in 2013 november at the oan - spm .",
    "the instrument was installed on a concrete pillar ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : instlolas ] ) to reduce vibrations .",
    "figure  [ fig : acs ] shows examples of autocovariance maps obtained from 30  000 scintillation images , during the nights 2013 november 16 and 17 . in the central peaks of figs .",
    "[ fig : acs]_a _ and  [ fig : acs]_c _ , the contribution of all turbulent layers in the atmosphere are added up .",
    "the correlated speckles produced by turbulent layers above @xmath69 are separated by a distance longer than the pupil diameter , thereby not giving rise to lateral peaks inside the autocovariance - map boundaries and avoiding the corresponding @xmath70 estimate . only the layers below @xmath69 form visible lateral peaks from which @xmath70 values are retrieved .",
    "a white rectangle frames the right - hand side lateral peaks in figs .",

    "weaker peaks can clearly be seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : acs]_d _ only exhibits ground - level turbulence .",
    "the @xmath71 profiles are obtained using a modified clean algorithm @xcite based on the one presented by @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] we present a few profiles obtained on 2013 november 16 and 17 using autocovariance maps whose examples are shown in fig  [ fig : acs ] .",
    "the purpose of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] is only to display the ability of the instrument in measuring @xmath70 profiles and their characteristics .",
    "it is not intended for studying the optical turbulence at the site .",
    "altitude resolution , maximum sensed altitude and noise level values are summarised in table  [ tab : paramsstars ] .",
    "note that the altitude resolution obtained when using 12 cam as a target is the best ever achieved with scidar - like techniques .",
    "the noise levels indicated in table  [ tab : paramsstars ] are the @xmath0 values that correspond to the @xmath72 , i.e. three times the standard deviation on the autocovariance - map background @xcite .",
    "the profiles corresponding to november 16 show three turbulent layers : one at ground level , the second at 81 m and the weakest at 390 m. on november 17 , almost all turbulence below 400 m was concentrated at ground level . only a weak turbulent layer is detected at 170 m above the ground at 11:27 ut that night .",
    "it is worth recalling that @xmath0 values obtained with scidar techniques in which the pupil images are not superimposed on the detector , like lolas , do not need to be corrected for the normalization error pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the second generation of the low layer scidar incorporates a simplified optical layout , a stiff and precise telescope mount and an open ritchey - chrtien telescope with excellent focus stability .",
    "the analysis of the image positions showed that the guiding quality of the mount permits to avoid the autoguiding algorithm that was used in the prototype lolas .",
    "similarly , the excellent focus stability of the telescope allows for observations without the autofocus algorithm employed in the former version of the instrument .",
    "examples of measurements obtained with lolas-2 illustrate the capability of the instrument for very high altitude - resolution profiling of the optical turbulence .",
    "a statistical analysis of @xmath1 profiles obtained so far at the oan - spm will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
