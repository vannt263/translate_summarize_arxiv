    "the ly@xmath0 line emitted by these galaxies is very prominent , often being the only observed feature .",
    "the prominence of the ly@xmath0 line is quantified by its equivalent width ( ew ) , defined as the total flux of the ly@xmath0 line , @xmath6 divided by the flux density of the continuum at 1216  : ew@xmath7 . throughout this paper we refer to the rest - frame ew of the ly@xmath0 line ( which a factor of @xmath8 lower than the ew in the observers frame ) .",
    "approximately @xmath9 of ly@xmath0 emitters ( hereafter laes ) at @xmath4 and @xmath10 have lines with ew@xmath11 @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "theoretical studies conclude that the maximum ew which can be produced by a conventional population of stars is 200 - 300  .",
    "moreover , this maximum ew can only be produced during the first few million years of a starburst , while at later times the luminous phase of ly@xmath0 ew gradually fades @xcite .",
    "therefore , observed ews lie near the upper envelope of values allowed by a normal stellar population .    the quoted value for the upper envelope of ew@xmath12 corresponds to the emitted ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "however not all ly@xmath0 photons are transmitted through the igm , and we expect some attenuation . within the framework of a cold dark matter cosmology ,",
    "gas surrounding galaxies is significantly overdense , and possesses an infall velocity relative to the mean igm @xcite . as a net result ,",
    "the igm surrounding high redshift galaxies is significantly opaque to ly@xmath0 photons .",
    "indeed it can be shown that for reasonable model assumptions , only @xmath13 of all ly@xmath0 photons are transmitted through the igm @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the intrinsic ly@xmath0 ew emitted by high redshift laes is systematically larger than observed .",
    "indeed , this observation suggests that a significant fraction of laes at @xmath14 have intrinsic ews that are much larger than can possibly be produced by a conventional population of young stars .",
    "one possible origin for this large ew population is provided by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which can have much larger ews due to their harder spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , large ew laes are not agn for several reasons : ( 1 ) the ly@xmath0 lines are too narrow @xcite ( 2 ) these objects typically lack high  ionisation state uv emission lines , which are symptomatic of agn activity @xcite , and ( 3 ) deep x - ray observations of 101 ly@xmath0 emitters by wang et al .",

    "several recent papers have investigated the stellar content of high - redshift laes by comparing stellar synthesis models with the observed broad band colors @xcite .",
    "these comparisons are often aided by deep irac observations on _ spitzer _ @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach . instead of focusing on individual galaxies ,",
    "our goal is to provide a simple model that describes the population of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies as a whole .",
    "this population is described by the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) and ly@xmath0 luminosity functions ( lfs ) at @xmath10 and @xmath15 , and the ly@xmath0 ew distribution at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the sample of high - redshift laes is becoming large enough that meaningful constraints can now be placed on simple models of galaxy formation .",

    "[ sec : popiii ] we describe our models . in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss our results , and compare with results from stellar synthesis models , before presenting our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the parameters for the background cosmology used throughout this paper are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the observed ly@xmath0 lfs at @xmath10 and @xmath15 are well described by a model in which the ly@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy increases in proportion to the mass of its host dark matter @xmath21 .",
    "one can constrain quantities related to the star formation efficiency from such a model ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , it is also possible to obtain constraints from the rest - frame uv - lfs .",
    "in contrast to the ly@xmath0 lf , the uv - lf is not affected by attenuation by the igm , which allows for more reliable constraints on quantities related to the star formation efficiency . in the first part of this paper (   [ sec : modellf]-  [ sec : igm ] ) we present limited modeling to illustrate parameter dependences , using the uv - lf to constrain model parameters related to star formation efficiency and lifetime . these model parameters may then be kept fixed , and the ly@xmath0 lfs and ew distributions used to constrain properties of high redshift laes such as their intrinsic ly@xmath0 ew and the fraction of ly@xmath0 that is transmitted through the igm . later , in ",
    "[ sec : popiii ] , we present our most general model , and fit to both the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs , as well as the ew distribution , simultaneously , treating all model parameters as free .",

    "uncertainty in this conversion factor does not affect our main conclusions .",
    "the presence of dust would lower the ratio of @xmath22 and @xmath32 , which could be compensated for by increasing @xmath24 .",
    "however , @xcite found that dust in @xmath33 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) attenuates the uv - flux by an average factor of only @xmath34 ( and dust obscuration may be even less important in laes , see   [ sec : q ] ) . since this is within the uncertainty of the constraint we obtain on @xmath24 , we ignore extinction by dust .",

    "the free parameters in our model are the duty cycle , @xmath26 , of the galaxy , and the fraction of baryons that are converted into stars , @xmath24 .",

    "note that when comparing to observed luminosities @xcite , we have replaced @xmath68 with @xmath56 .",
    "this is because the observed luminosities have been derived from the observed fluxes by assuming that all ly@xmath0 emerging from the galaxy was transmitted by the igm , whereas there is substantial absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this ratio is the median of the range found by @xcite .",

    "the likelihood for @xmath76 ( normalised to a peak of unity ) is shown in the inset .",
    "the best fit model is overplotted as the _ solid lines _ ,",
    "for which the value of the transmission is @xmath79 .",
    "the modeling presented in this and the previous section therefore suggests that , in order to simultaneously fit the ly@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions , only @xmath80 of the ly@xmath0 can be transmitted through the igm .",
    "this transmission is in good agreement with the results obtained by @xcite , who modeled the transmission directly and found that for reasonable model parameters the transmission must lie in the range @xmath81 .      while in agreement with the observed lfs , the model described in   [ sec : lya1 ] does not reproduce the very large observed equivalent widths .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity can be rewritten in terms of the star formation rate ( @xmath32 ) and ew as @xmath82ew@xmath83 .",
    "here we have used the relation @xmath84ew@xmath85 $ ] , where @xmath86 is the flux density in erg s@xmath31 hz@xmath31 at @xmath87 , and where we denoted the ly@xmath0 frequency and wavelength by @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assumed the spectrum to be constant between @xmath89 and @xmath90  .",
    "for @xmath66 , we find a best fit model that predicts laes to have an observed ew of @xmath91  .",
    "this value compares unfavorably with the observed sample that includes ews exceeding @xmath92 in @xmath93 of cases for ly@xmath0 selected galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus although our simple model can successfully reproduce the observed ly@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions , the model fails to reproduce the observed large ew laes .",
    "this discrepancy can not be remedied by changing the intrinsic ly@xmath0 emissivity of a given galaxy , @xmath64 : increasing @xmath64 would be simply be compensated for by a lower @xmath60 and vice versa . in the next section",
    "we discuss a simple modification of this model that aims to alleviate this discrepancy .",
    "the model described in   [ sec : modellf ] assumed that the ly@xmath0 flux of galaxies was subject to uniform attenuation by the igm . in this section",
    "we relax this assumption and investigate the predicted ews in a more realistic igm where transmission fluctuates between galaxies .",
    "we refer to this model as the fluctuating igm model . in this model",
    ", a larger transmission translates to a larger observed equivalent width . as a result ,",
    "galaxies with large @xmath60 are more easily detected , and the existence of these galaxies may therefore affect the observed ew - distribution for ly@xmath0 selected galaxies , even in cases where they comprise only a small fraction of the intrinsic population . in this section we investigate whether this bias could explain the anomalously large observed ew .",
    "we assume a log - normal distribution for @xmath76 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the log ( base 10 ) of the mean transmission and @xmath96 is the standard deviation in log - space . throughout this section",
    "we drop the subscript 57. eq  ( [ eq : lognorm ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath97 which gives the fraction of laes with @xmath98 .",
    "the number density of laes is then given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 eq  ( [ eq : nlya2 ] ) differs from eq  ( [ eq : form ] ) in two ways : ( 1 ) there is no lower integration limit , and ( 2 ) there is an additional term @xmath101 .",
    "these two differences reflect the facts that all masses contribute to the number density of laes brighter than @xmath56 , and that lower mass systems require larger transmissions ( eq  [ eq : ufunc ] ) which are less common ( eq  [ eq : lognormcum ] ) . in the limit @xmath102 , the function @xmath101 jumps from @xmath103 to @xmath104 at @xmath105 ( eq  [ eq:2 ] ) , which corresponds to the original eq  ( [ eq : form ] ) .",
    "in this formalism we may also write the number density of laes with transmission in the range @xmath106 @xmath107 , which is given by @xmath108 here @xmath109 is the minimum mass of galaxies that can be detected with a transmission in the range @xmath110 ( for @xmath111 the total flux falls below the detection threshold ) .",
    "the number density of laes with transmission in the range @xmath110 may be used to find the number density of laes with equivalent widths in the range @xmath112 ew@xmath113 via the relation ew@xmath114 (for the choice @xmath66 , see   [ sec : lya1 ] ) .",
    "eq  ( [ eq : ew ] ) shows that the observed equivalent width distribution takes the shape of the original transmission distribution , modulo a boost which increases towards larger ews .    as in ",
    "[ sec : lya1 ] we assume the best - fit model parameters for @xmath26 and @xmath24 derived from the uv - lfs determined in ",
    "[ sec : uv ] .",
    "we calculate model ly@xmath0 lfs on a grid of models in the @xmath115-plane , and generate likelihoods following the procedure outlined in   [ sec : lya1 ] .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure  [ fig : lya2d ] where we plot the ly@xmath0 lfs together with likelihood contours in the @xmath115-plane ( inset ) .",
    "the best - fit models favor no scatter in @xmath60 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that for any given model , a scatter in @xmath60 serves to flatten the model lf .",
    "however , the observed ly@xmath0 lf is quite steep , and as a result the data prefers a model with no scatter .",
    "furthermore , a scatter in @xmath60 results in a model lf that lies above the original ( constant transmission ) lf at all @xmath117 .",
    "this also explains the shape of the contours in the @xmath115-plane ; increasing @xmath118 must be compensated for by lowering @xmath119 ) . to illustrate the impact of a fluctuating @xmath60 , the model lfs shown in figure  [ fig : lya2d ]",
    "are not those of the best - fit model , but of a model with @xmath120 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] shows the observed ew - distribution ( _ solid line _ ) at @xmath10 associated with the ly@xmath0 lfs shown in figure  [ fig : lya2d ] .",
    "this model may be compared to the observed distribution ( shown as the _ histogram _ , data from shimasaku et al , 2006 ) .",
    "the upper horizontal axis shows the transmission corresponding to each equivalent width . the _ dotted line _ shows the distribution of transmission ( given by eq  [ eq : lognorm ] ) .",
    "note that the range of transmissions shown in figure  [ fig : ew ] extends to @xmath121 , which of course is not physical .",
    "the model ew - distribution has a tail towards larger ews .",
    "however , the model distribution peaks at ew@xmath122  . as was seen in the constant transmission model , this is clearly inconsistent with the observations , which favor values of ew@xmath92  .",
    "@xcite also show a probability distribution of ew , which is probably closer to the actual distribution .",
    "although this distribution does peak closer to ew@xmath122  , it is still significantly broader than that of the model ( see   [ sec : discuss ] for more arguments against the fluctuating igm model ) .",
    "we point out that the model distribution shown in figure  [ fig : ew ] is independent of the assumed value of @xmath63 .",
    "[ sec : popiii ] in ",
    "[ sec : modellf ] we demonstrated that a simple model where @xmath123 and @xmath124 were linearly related to halo mass can reproduce the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs , but not the observed ew distribution . in ",
    "[ sec : igm ] we showed that this situation is not remedied by a variable igm transmission , and that favored models have a constant transmission . in this section we discuss an alternate model , which leads to consistency with both the observed ly@xmath0 lfs , uv - lfs , and the ew - distribution . in this model , galaxies are assumed to have a bright ly@xmath0 phase ( hereafter the population iii-phase ) which lasts a fraction @xmath125 of the galaxies life - time .",
    "after this the galaxy s ly@xmath0 luminosity drops to the normal value for population ii star formation .    this model may be viewed as an extension of the idea originally described by @xcite , that large ew laes are young galaxies in the early stages of their lives . in this picture , the sudden drop in ly@xmath0 luminosity could represent i ) a sudden drop in the ionising luminosity when the first o - stars died , or ii ) an enhanced dust - opacity after enrichment by the first type - ii supernovae . alternatively , our parametrisation could represent a scenario in which the population iii phase ended after the first population iii stars enriched the surrounding interstellar gas from which subsequent generations of stars formed .",
    "hence , we refer to this model as the population iii model .",
    "we will show that to be consistent with the large values of the observed ew , a very massive population of stars is required during the early stages of star formation .    to minimise the number of free parameters we modeled the time dependence of the ly@xmath0 ew as a step - function .",
    "the number density of laes is then given by @xmath126 here , @xmath127 is the mass related to @xmath56 through @xmath128 , while @xmath129 is the population iii mass , which is calculated with @xmath64 replaced by @xmath130ew@xmath131 erg s@xmath31 .",
    "whereas in previous sections we chose fiducial or best fit parameters for illustration , for the model described in this section we take the most general approach .",
    "we fit the model simultaneously to the uv - lf and ly@xmath0 lfs , as well as to the observed ew - distribution of ly@xmath0 selected galaxies .",
    "this model predicts two observed equivalent widths ( @xmath132ew@xmath133 and @xmath132ew@xmath134 ) in various abundances .",
    "the associated mean and variance from the model are compared to the observed ew - distribution , which has a mean of @xmath135ew@xmath136  , and a standard deviation of @xmath137  .",
    "our model has 6 free parameters @xmath138 .",
    "we produce likelihoods for each parameter by marginalising over the others in this space .",
    "the lower set of panels in figure  [ fig : popiii ] show likelihood contours for our model parameters at @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the peak likelihood .",
    "the best - fit models have ew@xmath139  and @xmath140 which corresponds to a physical timescale for the population - iii phase of @xmath141 myr ( for @xmath142 ) .",
    "the model ly@xmath0 luminosity functions at z=5.7 and z=6.5 described by @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 are shown as solid lines and provide good fits to the data .",
    "the model produces two observed ews , namely @xmath146ew@xmath147  and @xmath148 ew@xmath149  .",
    "it is worth emphasising that the emitted ew of the bright phase depends on the choice @xmath63 via ew@xmath150  .",
    "hence , a lower / higher value of @xmath63 would decrease / increase the intrinsic brightness of the population iii phase .",
    "note that @xmath151 when laes formed out of gas of solar metallicity , which is unreasonable given the universe was only @xmath152 gyr old at @xmath153 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath154 would have yielded a best - fit @xmath155 , which is well outside the range calculated by @xcite .",
    "we there conclude that @xmath63 is in excess of unity .",
    "in performing fits we have fixed the value of ew@xmath134 to correspond to a standard stellar population , and then explored the possibility that there might be a second phase of sf producing a larger ew .",
    "our modeling finds strong statistical evidence for this early phase and rules out the null - hypothesis that properties can be described by population - ii stars alone at high confidence ( _ grey region _ in the _ lower left panel _ inset of fig  [ fig : popiii ] ) . despite the fact that the best fit model has a bright phase which lasts only a few per cent of the total star formation lifetime , the two populations of laes are similarly abundant in model realisations of the observed sample in ly@xmath0 selected galaxies ( see   [ sec : uvew ] for a more detailed comparison to the observed ew distributions ) .",
    "this is shown in the _ lower left panel _ in figure  [ fig : popiii ] in which the _ solid line _ ( with label 1.0 ) shows the combination of @xmath125 and ew@xmath133 for which the observed number of galaxies in the population iii phase ( @xmath156 ) equals that in the population ii phase ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "the _ dashed lines _ show the cases @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the duration of the bright ly@xmath0 phase meets theoretical expectations for a burst of star formation , while the large ew requires a very massive stellar population ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in summary ,",
    "in order to reproduce both the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs , and the observed population of large ew galaxies , we require a burst of very massive star formation lasting @xmath160 per cent of the galaxies lifetime .",
    "@xcite show that 11 out of 14 lae candidates among i - drop galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field have ew@xmath161  .",
    "if galaxies are included for which only upper or lower limits on the ew are available , then this fraction becomes 21 out of 26 .",
    "thus the distribution of ews for i - drop selected galaxies differs strongly from the ew - distribution observed by @xcite .",
    "we next describe why this strong dependence of the observed ly@xmath0 ew distribution on the precise galaxy selection criteria arises naturally in our population iii model .",
    "we first assume that the ly@xmath0 selected and uv - selected galaxies were drawn from the same population ( this assumption is discussed further in   [ sec : q ] ) . in our model a galaxy that is selected based on it s rest - frame uv - continuum emission has a probability @xmath125 of being observed in the ly@xmath0 bright phase , while the probability of finding a galaxies in the ly@xmath0 faint phase is @xmath162 . in   [ sec : popiii ] we found @xmath163 , hence an i - drop galaxy is @xmath164 times more likely to have a low than a high observed ew . if we denote the number of galaxies with ew@xmath165 by @xmath156 , and the number of galaxies with ew@xmath161 by @xmath157 , then the model predicts @xmath166@xmath167 , while the observed fraction including the galaxies for which the ew is known as upper or lower limit is @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the qualitative difference in observed ly@xmath0 ew distribution among i - drop galaxies in the hudf and among ly@xmath0 selected galaxies follows naturally from our two - phase star formation model .",
    "note that our model predicts population iii star formation to be observed in @xmath169 of the @xmath33 lbg population .",
    "the dependence of the observed ew distribution on the selection criteria used to construct the sample of galaxies is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ewsel ] . to construct this figure ,",
    "we have taken the best - fit population iii model of   [ sec : popiii ] .",
    "for the purpose of presentation , we let the igm fluctuate according to the prescription of   [ sec : igm ] with @xmath170 , so that the model predicts a finite range of ews in each phase .",
    "the _ left and right panels _ show the predicted ew distribution for ly@xmath0 selected ( _ left panel _ ) and uv - selected ( _ right panel _ ) galaxies as the _ solid lines _ , respectively . for a uv - selected galaxy",
    "the probability of being in the bright phase and having an observed ew in the range ew@xmath171 is @xmath172 . here",
    "@xmath173 is the probability that the igm transmission is in the range @xmath174 , which is derived from eq  [ eq : lognorm ] .",
    "the units on the vertical axis are arbitrary , and chosen to illustrate the different predicted and observed ly@xmath0 ew distribtions for the two samples at large ews . the observed distributions for ly@xmath0 and uv selected galaxies , shown as _ histograms _ ,",
    "are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : ewsel ] clearly shows that both the predicted and observed ly@xmath0 selected samples contain significantly more large ew laes than the uv - selected sample .",
    "our model naturally explains the qualitative shape of these distributions and their differences .    before proceeding we mention a caveat to the distributions shown in figure  [ fig : ewsel ] . in our model",
    "all galaxies have an ew of @xmath132ew@xmath175 during the population ii phase , while in contrast @xcite do not detect 10 out of 26 lbgs , which implies that @xmath176 of lbgs have an ew@xmath177  .",
    "thus there is a descrepancy between our model and the observations with respect to the value of ew in the population ii phase .",
    "the resolution of this discrepancy lies in the fact that the very low ew emitters are drawn from the uv ( i - drop ) sample and not the ly@xmath0 selected sample our model was set up to describe .",
    "this issue is discussed in more detail in   [ sec : q ] .",
    "an ew distribution of dropout sources was also presented by @xcite .",
    "these authors performed an analysis similar to @xcite and found 1 lae with ew@xmath178 among 22 candidate z=6.0 lbgs .",
    "when interpreted in reference to our model , this translates to @xmath179 , which is consistent with the model predictions . therefore , when interpreted in light of a two - phase star formation history and different selection methods , the ew distribution observed by @xcite is consistent with that found by @xcite .",
    "if population iii star formation does provide the explanation for the very large ew ly@xmath0 emitters , then we would expect the large ew emitters to become less common with time as the mean metallicity of the universe increased . to test this idea",
    ", we can compare the ew - distribution at @xmath10 with the results at lower redshift from @xcite who found that @xmath180 of @xmath181 lbgs have ly@xmath0 ew@xmath182  , and that @xmath183 of @xmath181 lbgs to have ly@xmath0 ew@xmath184  .",
    "@xcite argue that the fraction of large ew ly@xmath0 lines at @xmath153 is consistent with that observed at @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "however , if the ew distribution did not evolve with redshift , then the probability that a sample of 22 lbgs will contain at least 1 lae with ew@xmath185 is @xmath186 .",
    "thus the hypothesis that the observed ew distribution remains constant is ruled out at the @xmath187 level . on the other hand , in a similar analysis",
    "@xcite found 5 out of 26 lbgs to have an ew@xmath188  .",
    "if the ew distribution did not evolve with redshift , then the probability of finding 5 ew@xmath188 in this sample is only @xmath189 . furthermore , @xcite recently found at least 5 laes with ew@xmath165 at @xmath190 , and conclude that 8% of i-drop galaxies in the subaru deep field have ew@xmath165  , which is significantly larger than the fraction of large ew lbgs at @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the observed ew distribution of lbgs at @xmath153 is skewed more toward large ews than at @xmath181 .",
    "the strength of this result is increased by the fact that the igm is more opaque to ly@xmath0 photons at @xmath153 than at @xmath181 .",
    "thus we conclude that the intrinsic ew distribution must have evolved with redshift .",
    "population synthesis models have suggested that the broad band colors of observed laes are best described with young stellar populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the stellar populations in three laes to be @xmath191 myr old , and possibly as old as @xmath192 myr ( where the precise age upper limit depends on the assumed star formation history of the galaxies ) .",
    "however as was argued by @xcite , since these galaxies were selected based on their detection in irac , a selection bias towards older stellar populations may exist ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that laes with ew@xmath193 have ages @xmath1944 myr , while laes with ew@xmath195 have ages between 20 - 400 myr .",
    "this latter result in particular agrees well with our population iii model . on the other hand , in a fluctuating igm model for example",
    ", the ew of laes should be uncorrelated with age .    in models presented in this paper , on average @xmath196 of all baryons",
    "are converted into stars within halos of mass @xmath197 , yielding stellar masses in the range @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "this compares unfavorably with the typical stellar masses found observationally in laes which can be as low as @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "however , the lowest stellar masses are found ( naturally ) for the younger galaxies .",
    "indeed , the laes with the oldest stellar populations can have stellar masses as large as @xmath200 .",
    "thus , we do not find the derived stellar masses in laes to be at odds with the results of this paper .",
    "if significant very massive ( or population iii ) star formation indeed occurred in high redshift laes , then one may expect these stars to reveal themselves in unusual broad - band colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the most distinctive feature in the spectrum of population iii stars is the number of h and he ionising photons ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "since these are ( mostly ) absorbed in the igm , the broad band spectrum of population iii stars is in practice difficult to distinguish from a normal stellar population @xcite , especially when nebular continuum emission is taken into account ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig  1 ) .",
    "hence , population iii stars would not necessarily be accompanied by unusually blue broad band colors .",
    "we have shown that a simple model in which high - redshift galaxies go through a population - iii phase lasting @xmath201 myr can simultaneously explain the observed ly@xmath0 lfs at @xmath10 and @xmath15 @xcite , and the observed ew - distribution of ly@xmath0 selected galaxies at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition , this model predicts the much lower ews found in the population of uv selected galaxies ( stanway et al , 2007 , see   [ sec : uvew ] ) .",
    "moreover the constraints on the population - iii model parameters such as the duration and the equivalent width of the bright phase are physically plausible , and consistent with existing population synthesis work ( see   [ sec : syn ] ) .    are there other interpretations of the large observed ews ?",
    "one possibility was discussed in   [ sec : igm ] , where we showed that the simple model in which the igm transmission fluctuates between galaxies reproduces the lfs , but fails to simultaneously reproduce the ly@xmath0 lfs and the observed ew - distribution .",
    "in addition , this model fails to reproduce other observations .",
    "@xcite calculated the impact of the high - redshift reionised igm on ly@xmath0 emission lines and found the range of plausible transmissions to lie in the range @xmath202 .",
    "this work showed that it is possible to boost the transmission to ( much ) larger values but not without increasing the observed width of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "absorption in the igm typically erases all flux blueward of the ly@xmath0 resonance , and when infall is accounted for , part of the ly@xmath0 redward of the ly@xmath0 resonance as well .",
    "this implies that ly@xmath0 lines that are affected by absorption in the igm are systematically narrower than they would have been if no absorption in the igm had taken place .",
    "it follows that in the fluctuating igm model , ly@xmath0 ew should be strongly correlated with the observed ly@xmath0 line width ( or fhwm ) . this correlation is not observed .",
    "in fact , observations suggest that an anti - correlation exists between ew and fwhm @xcite .",
    "this anti - correlation provides strong evidence against the anomalously large ews being produced by a fluctuating igm transmission .",
    "a second possibility is the presence of galaxies with strong superwinds .",
    "the models of @xcite did not study the impact of superwinds on the ly@xmath0 line profile .",
    "the presence of superwinds can cause the ly@xmath0 line to emerge with a systematic redshift relative to the ly@xmath0 resonance through back scattering of ly@xmath0 photons off the far side of the shell that surrounds the galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , superwinds tend not only to redshift the ly@xmath0 line , they also make the ly@xmath0 line appear broader than when this scattering does not occur . as in the case of the fluctuating igm model , this results in a predicted correlation between ew and fwhm , which is not observed .",
    "furthermore in wind - models , the overall redshift of the ly@xmath0 line , and thus @xmath60 , increases with wind velocity , @xmath203 .",
    "this predicts that ew increases with wind velocity .",
    "however , observations of @xmath181 lbgs by @xcite show that ew correlates with @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the large ew in laes can not be produced by superwind galaxies",
    ".    a third possibility might be that within the ly@xmath0 emitting galaxy , cold , dusty clouds lie embedded in a hot inter - cloud medium of negligible ly@xmath0 opacity .",
    "under such conditions , the continuum photons can suffer more attenuation than ly@xmath0 photons which bounce from cloud to cloud and mainly propagate through the hot , transparent inter - cloud medium @xcite .",
    "this attenuation of continuum leads to a large ew .",
    "we point out that in this scenario , large ew laes are not intrinsically brighter in ly@xmath0 . at fixed ly@xmath0 flux ,",
    "one is therefore equally likely to detect a low ew lae .",
    "in other words , to produce the observed ew distribution one requires preferential destruction of continuum flux by dust in @xmath205 of the galaxies .",
    "currently there is no evidence that this mechanism is at work even in one galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the rest - frame uv colors of galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field imply that dust in high - redshift galaxies suppresses the continuum flux by only a factor of @xmath206 @xcite .",
    "the maximum boost of the ew in a multi - phase ism is therefore @xmath34 , which is not nearly enough to produce intrinsic equivalent widths of ew@xmath207  . in summary ,",
    "the only model able to simultaneously explain all observations calls for a short burst of very massive star formation .      in ",
    "[ sec : uvew ] we have shown that the observed ew distributions of ly@xmath0 selected and i - drop galaxies and their differences can be reproduced qualitatively with our population iii model . however , in our model all high - redshift galaxies have an observed ew of at least @xmath132ew@xmath208  , whereas many i - drop galaxies are not detected in ly@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite show that the uv - lfs of laes at @xmath15 and @xmath10 overlap with that constructed by @xcite from a sample of @xmath209 @xmath153 lbgs discovered in the hubble deep fields .",
    "naively , this overlap implies that lbgs and laes are the same population and therefore that all lbgs should be detected by ly@xmath0 surveys .",
    "since ly@xmath0 surveys only detect galaxies with ew@xmath210  , this suggests all lbgs should have a ly@xmath0 ew 20 contrary to observation . to illustrate this point further",
    ", we have taken the best - fit population iii model shown in figure  [ fig : popiii ] and compared the model predictions for the rest - frame uv - lf with that of @xcite in figure  [ fig : bouwens ] .",
    "clearly , our best - fit population iii model fits the data well .",
    "however , @xcite found @xmath176 of i - drop galaxies in the hudf to have an observed ew@xmath177  , and a similar result was presented by @xcite .",
    "two effects may help reconcile these two apparently conflicting sets of observations : ( i ) @xcite found ly@xmath0 emitting lbgs to be systematically smaller .",
    "that is , for a fixed angular size , the @xmath211-band flux of laes is systematically higher with @xmath212 .",
    "if we assume that the angular scale of a galaxy is determined by the mass of its host halo , then this implies that for a fixed mass the @xmath211-band flux of laes is systematically higher , and ( ii ) only a fraction of lbgs are laes . the drop - out technique used to select high redshift galaxies",
    "is known to introduce a bias against strong laes , as a strong ly@xmath0 line can affect the broad band colors of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this may cause @xmath213 of large ew laes to be missed using the i - drop technique @xcite .",
    "if only a fraction @xmath214 of all lbgs are detected in ly@xmath0 , then effect ( i ) would explain why the uv - lf of laes lies less than a factor of @xmath215 below the observed uv - lf of the general population of lbgs .",
    "this is because a more abundant lower mass halo is required to produce the same uv - flux in laes , which would shift the lf upwards .",
    "in addition , effect ( ii ) may reduce this difference even further .",
    "it follows that these two effects combined may cause the lfs to overlap .",
    "thus the overlap of the uv and ly@xmath0 selected uv - lfs appears to be a coincidence , and not evidence of their being the same population of galaxies .",
    "this implies that our model is valid for ly@xmath0 selected galaxies , but not the high - redshift population as a whole and explains the lack of very low ews in uv selected samples discussed in ",
    "[ sec : uvew ] .",
    "the reason why laes may be brighter in the uv for a fixed halo mass is unclear .",
    "it is possibly related to dust content .",
    "@xcite found the average amount of uv exctinction to be 0.4 mag in the total sample of @xmath153 lbgs .",
    "this value is close to the average excess @xmath211-band flux detected from laes for a given angular scale @xcite .",
    "if laes contain less ( or no ) dust , then this would explain why they are brighter in the uv and thus why they appear more compact .",
    "the possibility that ly@xmath0 quiet lbg contain more dust than their ly@xmath0 emitting counterparts is not very surprising , as a low dust abundance has the potential to eliminate the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "thus laes could be high redshift galaxies with a lower dust content .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that luminous lbgs , @xmath216 , typically do not contain large ew ly@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "this deficiency of large ew laes among uv - bright sources is not expected in our model , and may reflect that uv - bright sources are more massive , mature , galaxies that can not go through a population - iii phase anymore .",
    "it should be pointed out though that the absence of large ew laes among galaxies with @xmath216 in the survey of @xcite is consistent with our model : the observed number density of sources with @xmath216 is @xmath217 cmpc@xmath40 ( see fig  [ fig : uv ] ) . in our best - fit pop - iii model ( shown in fig  [ fig : popiii ] )",
    ", a fraction @xmath218 of these galaxies would be in the bright phase .",
    "this translates to a number density of large ew laes of @xmath219 cmpc@xmath40 .",
    "given the survey volume of @xmath220 cmpc@xmath221 , the expected number of large ew laes with @xmath216 is @xmath222 , and the absence of large ew lae among uv bright sources is thus not surprising .      in our model large ew laes are less massive by a factor of ew@xmath223ew@xmath224 at fixed ly@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "since clustering of dark matter halos increases with mass , it follows that our model predicts large ew laes to be clustered less than their low ew counterparts ( at a fixed ly@xmath0 luminosity ) .",
    "the clustering of laes is typically quantified by their angular correlation function ( acf ) , @xmath225 , which gives the excess ( over random ) probability of finding a pair of laes separated by an angle @xmath226 on the sky .",
    "the acf depends on the square of the bias parameter ( @xmath227 ) , which for galaxies in the population ii phase is @xmath228 times larger than for galaxies in the population iii phase , for the mass range of interest .",
    "this implies that the clustering of low ew laes at fixed ly@xmath0 luminosity is enhanced by a factor of @xmath229 .",
    "existing determinations of the acf of laes by @xcite and @xcite are still too uncertain to test this prediction .",
    "observations of high redshift ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies ( laes ) have shown the typical equivalent width ( ew ) of the ly@xmath0 line to increase dramatically with redshift , with a significant fraction of the galaxies lying at @xmath1 having an ew@xmath188   .",
    "recent calculations by @xcite show that the igm at @xmath230 transmits only @xmath231 of the ly@xmath0 photons emitted by galaxies . in this paper",
    "we have investigated the transmission using a model that reproduces the observed ly@xmath0 and uv lfs .",
    "this model results in an empirically determined transmission of @xmath232 , where @xmath63 denotes the ly@xmath0 luminosity per unit star formation rate ( in @xmath62 yr@xmath31 ) @xmath64 in units of @xmath233 (   [ sec : modellf ] ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with earlier theoretical results .",
    "if only @xmath80 of all ly@xmath0 that was emitted by high redshift galaxies reaches the observer , then this impies that the intrinsic ews are systematically ( much ) larger than observed in many cases . to investigate the origin of these very high ews",
    ", we have developed semi - analytic models for the ly@xmath0 and uv luminosity functions and the distribution of equivalent widths . in this",
    "model ly@xmath0 emitters undergo a burst of very massive star formation that results in a large intrinsic ew , followed by a phase of population - ii star formation that produces a lower ew only specifies that galaxies go through a population - iii phase for a fraction @xmath163 of their lifetimes .",
    "our model does not specify when this population - iii phase occurs .",
    "hypothetically , the population iii phase could occur at an arbitrary moment in the galaxies lifetime when it is triggered by a merger of a regular star forming galaxy and a dark matter halo containing gas of primordial composition .",
    "note however that such a model would probably have difficulties explaining the apparent observed correlation between ly@xmath0 ew and the age of a stellar population (   [ sec : syn ] ) . ] .",
    "this model is referred to as the population iii model and is an extension of the idea originally described by @xcite , who proposed large ew ly@xmath0 emitters to be young galaxies .",
    "the population iii model in which the ly@xmath0 equivalent width is ew@xmath234 for @xmath235 myr , is able to simultaneously describe the following eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population : i - iv ) the uv and ly@xmath0 luminosity functions of laes at z=5.7 and 6.5 , v - vi ) the mean and variance of the ew distribution of ly@xmath0 selected galaxies at z=5.7 , vii ) the ew distribution of uv- selected galaxies at z@xmath36 (   [ sec : popiii ] ) , and viii ) the observed correlation of stellar age and mass with ew (   [ sec : syn ] ) .",
    "our modeling suggests that the anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths observed in about half of the high redshift ly@xmath0 emitters require a burst of very massive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of the galaxies star forming lifetime .",
    "this very massive star formation may indicate the presence of population - iii star formation in a large number of high - redshift laes .",
    "the model parameters for the best - fit model are physically plausible where not previously known ( e.g. those related to the efficiency and duration of star formation ) , and agree with estimates where those have been calculated directly ( e.g the igm transmission , ew@xmath133 , and @xmath125 ) .    in addition",
    ", we argued that the observed overlap of the uv - lfs of laes with that of z@xmath236 lbgs appears to be at odds the observed ly@xmath0 detection rate in high - redshift lbgs , suggesting that laes and lbgs are not the same population .",
    "a lower dust content of laes relative to their ` ly@xmath0 quiet ' counterparts would partly remedy this discrepancy , and could also explain why laes appear to be typically more compact (   [ sec : q ] ) .",
    "semi - analytic modeling of the coupled reionisation and star formation histories of the universe suggests that population iii star formation could still occur after the bulk of reionisation had been completed @xcite .",
    "the observation of anomalously large ews in ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at high redshift may therefore provide observational evidence for such a scenario . in the future , the he 1640  may be used as a complementary probe ( e.g * ? ? ?",
