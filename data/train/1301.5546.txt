    "thus , we can conclude that @xmath164 goes down with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "but unfortunately , we can not determine the exact number of @xmath164 from this analytical formulation .    in our numerical analysis",
    ", we have considered the circuit model used by hassel et .",
    "al @xcite , and modified it for current bias configuration . here",
    "we have calculated the island charge as a function of time by taking into account three contributions : charge relaxation through @xmath60 together with the tunnel current through the emitter and base junctions , respectively .",
    "the tunnel currents through these junctions are calculated using time dependent @xmath38 - theory @xcite . in the simulation , @xmath38 is calculated numerically by considering only the real part of the environmental impedence .",
    "the simulation - run - time was chosen longer than the time constant due to @xmath61 and the capacitance from base to ground so that the steady state was reached properly .",
    "moreover , we monitored the tunneling events on the island with time , which clearly revealed the bloch oscillating state and its transition to the higher band . by counting the number of tunneling events",
    "when the system undergoes a change from higher band to lower band we could calculate @xmath164 from the simulation .",
    "according to the basic theory of the bot operation , the gain should depend exponentially on @xmath14 via the tunneling rates @xmath69 and @xmath169 @xcite when @xmath49 . in this small-@xmath0 limit , the energy gap between the first two bands is small , which facilitates the use of the up- and down transition rates ( eqs .",
    "[ uprate ] and [ downrate ] ) from perturbation theory . in our experiments",
    "we are well in this limit , which has not been the case in many of the previous measurements , for example , in ref .",

    "the estimates from the basic theory @xcite amount to @xmath174 for @xmath175 @xmath112ev , well below the measured values .",
    "moreover , we did not observe any variation of the maximum gain with @xmath0 , which , together with magnitude of @xmath139 , is consistent with the operation near the bifurcation point where the main gain mechanism has a different origin than in the regular bot operation .    in the operating regime near the bifurcation point ,",
    "the base current is a combination of a working point current , not inducing inter - band transitions , and a significantly smaller part that leads to transitions , the ratio of these two currents being given by the parameter @xmath176 . in our phenomenological modeling with large number of intra - band transitions ,",
    "the current gain is simply related to @xmath177 and the upward tunneling rate @xmath69 ( see eqs .",
    "[ neprime ] and [ avgcurrent ] ) .",
    "hence , a large current gain is expected when approaching a regime where there are two stable solutions for the base current with different values for @xmath178 .",
    "when @xmath176 is large , then almost all of the current is used to just keep the operating point . in our simulation",
    "we find a factor of 15 change in @xmath179 over the measured range but unfortunately , our analysis is not able to yield absolute numbers for @xmath180 from our measured data .",
    "when comparing our findings with the numerical work of hassel and sepp @xcite , we find a weaker overall dependence of the device performance on the sample parameters and biasing parameters than was found in the simulations .",
    "the weaker overall dependence may , of course , be valid only for the regime of the sample parameters / device configurations that were investigated in the present work .",
    "nevertheless , the weaker parameter dependence is an important factor that contributes to the success of the simple phenomenological modeling that we have employed .",
    "the weaker overall changes may also indicate that there is external noise present in the measurements and our results should be compared with simulations performed at a higher effective temperature .",
    "furthermore , as an example of the differences , let us point out that if we take the hysteresis parameter from ref .",
    ", @xmath181 , we find that our sample # 1 should be bifurcated at all base currents ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "we think that the absence of bifurcation at @xmath121 with @xmath82 well above 1 indicates the necessity to add a capacitance in parallel to @xmath60 into the simulations , which would take into account the parasitic capacitance component on the sample chip .",
    "this parasitic capacitance will influence the coulomb blockade at large frequencies , at which it will reduce the real part of the impedance seen by the josephson junction .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the dynamics and modeling of the bot when approaching a bifurcation point governed by intricate interband transition dynamics .",
    "our results present the first experimental analysis on the behavior of the bot in the regime where its behavior is fully governed by switching dynamics with the rates imposed by the biasing conditions .",
    "we have reached record - large current gains even though the device was operated just at small josephson coupling energies @xmath183 @xmath112ev .",
    "we have mapped a cross - over transition diagram on the @xmath0 vs @xmath5 plane and compared its shape to analytic modeling , where the intraband transitions are included in terms of a phenomenological parameter @xmath164 .",
    "the same modeling was also successfully applied to describe how the current gain diverges as a function of the base current @xmath5 .",
    "our findings are consistent with the gain divergence as 1/(1-@xmath82 ) where the hysteresis parameter @xmath82 is only weakly dependent of @xmath0 .",
    "the weak dependence makes this regime attractive for application where large current gain is needed at low frequencies .",
