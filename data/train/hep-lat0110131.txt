    "et.al_@xcite have shown that the wilson action has a stable heavy quark limit . at finite lattice spacing and these heavy quark masses",
    ", there are different mass parameters that can be defined with varying lattice artifacts . by appropriately tuning the input parameters and removing the lattice artifacts by continuum limit extrapolation",
    ", one can recover the continuum mass definition .",
    "the agreement of the different lattice masses has been demonstrated for the charm quark mass by kronfeld@xcite where the matching to the conventional @xmath0 scheme was performed at the one loop level . in this work",
    ", we calculate the lattice two loop renormalization constant using large @xmath2 monte - carlo techniques which were demonstrated for wilson quarks in an earlier work@xcite .",
    "these constants are then used to determine the charm quark mass in the @xmath0 scheme at two loop order .",
    "the matching of the lattice to continuum mass is performed using the pole mass as an intermediate step . in determining the pole mass from the lattice at finite lattice spacing ,",
    "one has several choices for the masses that differ in their lattice artifacts .",
    "the rest mass ( @xmath3 ) and the kinetic mass ( @xmath4 ) were used in ref .",
    "@xcite to determine the @xmath0 mass at one loop order .",
    "the rest mass is derived from the spin averaged binding energy of the charmonium 1s states and the other from the quark s kinetic mass .",
    "it was shown in that paper that the two quantities defined as such do indeed agree in the continuum limit . in this work",
    ", we choose to work with the former quantity , @xmath3 , mainly for its simplicity .",
    "the two loop relation between the pole mass and the @xmath0 mass has been calculated by gray _",
    "the relationship in the quenched approximation is given by , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pole mass .",
    "the corresponding expression for the pole mass determined from the spin averaged binding energy is@xcite , @xmath7}_1\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\alpha_v(q^\\star)({{\\mathrm a}}^{-1}{\\tilde{m}}^{[1]}_1)+\\alpha_v(q^\\star)^2({{\\mathrm a}}^{-1}{\\tilde{m}}^{[2]}_1)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the definition of the perturbative coefficients ( @xmath8}_1 $ ] ) is slightly different than those given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the charm quark mass in the @xmath0 scheme is determined at two loop order from these two expressions .",
    "mertens _ et al._@xcite have tabulated the mass dependent one loop coefficients , @xmath9}_1 $ ] , for a wide range of bare quark masses . we determine the two loop coefficent , @xmath10}_1 $ ] , using large @xmath2 monte carlo methods@xcite .",
    "the procedure is essentially the same as described in ref .",
    "@xcite except that we use a different gauge and periodic twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we first fix to the axial gauge instead of starting from the coulomb gauge for these clover - improved quarks . the periodic twisted b.c .",
    "gives much smaller finite volume dependence than the anti - periodic b.c .",
    "used for the wilson quarks .",
    "we use three values of the hopping parameter which were tuned to the spin - averaged @xmath11 kinetic mass .",
    "the three values correspond to tuning performed at @xmath12 , 5.9 and 6.1 .",
    "mean link tadpole - improved tree level value for the clover coefficient was used in the tuning .",
    "since we do not know the nonperturbative value of the critical mass at large @xmath2 , the tadpole - improved bare quark mass ( @xmath13 ) is held fixed in the perturbative expansion .",
    "this gives rise to a difference in the treatment of the power divergences between this work and ref .",
    "@xcite where this is treated nonperturbatively .",
    "however , the knowledge of the two loop constant for the critical mass will allow to switch between the two schemes .",
    "the couplings and the lattice volumes used are similar to the ones used for the wilson quark study .",
    "this includes 7 values of @xmath14 and 7 volumes , from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the statistics is comparable to the anti - periodic lattices . for @xmath17",
    ", we have an extra lattice , @xmath18 , with lower statistics to provide a check for the infinite volume extrapolation .",
    "the quark propagators are fit to a hyperbolic cosine from timeslice 3 to extract the rest mass , @xmath3 .",
    "these were all good fits with @xmath19 s less than the degrees of freedom .",
    "the fits from timeslice 4 and 5 gave results which were consistent but with larger errors .",
    "at each weak coupling , we extrapolate the rest masses to the infinite volume limit where we assume the following form for the finite volume corrections , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are varied independently .",
    "we then fit the rest masses from each weak coupling to a power series ( fourth order ) in @xmath23 .",
    "the prescription for the determination of @xmath24 given in ref.@xcite results in a very large @xmath24 especially for @xmath25 since the one - loop coefficient is rather small .",
    "however , we note that the two loop coefficients extracted at two different reasonable @xmath24s scales within the errors .",
    "we therefore use the values of the blm - lm combined @xmath24s from ref .",
