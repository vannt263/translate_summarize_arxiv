    "due to seminal works on quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and quantum key distribution @xcite , entanglement in multipartite quantum systems began to be recognized as valuable resource for performing communication and computational tasks @xcite .",
    "this motivated the considerable interest in the development of a quantitative theory of entanglement and the definition of its basic measure ( concurrence , entanglement of formation and linear entropy @xcite ) .",
    "the physical implementation of entangled states is then of major importance and several different physical systems have been considered .",
    "we mention the generation of entangled electromagnetic states using type i or type ii parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "another experimentally accessible device which can be used to generate optical entangled states is the beam splitter @xcite . in quantum optics",
    "the action of a beam splitter , which is essentially a mixer of two electromagnetic modes , can be represented by a unitary operator relating the input and the output states . in general , the output state is a superposition of the fock states which is entangled , except the harmonic oscillator coherent states who do not exhibit entanglement when passed through one arm of 50:50 beam splitter while the second arm is left in the empty vacuum state @xcite .",
    "the beam splitter device provides a very useful technique to investigate the entanglement of nonorthogonal states as for instance the entangled coherent states introduced in @xcite .",
    "they found a notable success in the context of quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , tests of local realism @xcite and very recently an approach for quantum repeaters with entangled coherent states was proposed in @xcite .",
    "all those applications explain their intensive investigation . in this sense ,",
    "the entanglement behavior of @xmath2 spin coherent states , when passed through a beam splitter , has been previously considered in @xcite .",
    "similar study was done in @xcite for @xmath8 coherent states defined in an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "entangled quantum systems can exhibit correlations that can not be explained on the basis of classical laws and the lack of entanglement in a collection of states is clearly a signature of classicality @xcite .",
    "the fact that the coherent states minimize the quantum fluctuations @xcite and subsequently present semi - classical behavior , constitutes the main motivation to use them for the understanding of bipartite @xcite as well as the multipartite entanglement of harmonic oscillator coherent states @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we shall be interested in the bipartite entanglement of generalized coherent states generated from the quantum electromagnetic states passing through a quantum network of @xmath1 beam splitters .",
    "we show that under some special assumptions , one can generate @xmath2 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 for @xmath11 or more generally @xmath0 multipartite coherent states which are labeled by continuous variables related to reflection - transmission coefficients of the beam splitters .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we define the action of a quantum network of @xmath1 beam splitters .",
    "we show that this action leads @xmath0 coherent states , in the perelomov sense , labeled by complex variables related to reflection and transmission parameters of beam splitters .",
    "this means that multi - port beam splitters are applicable in optical realizations of coherent states associated with higher symmetries . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the superpositions of equally weighted @xmath2 multipartite coherent states arising from two quantum networks of beam splitters characterized by different reflection - transmission parameters . by",
    "equally weighted , we mean that each multipartite wave function is equally balanced with the other element in the superposition .",
    "we divide the entire system into two subsystems to discuss the bipartite entanglement .",
    "we employ the concurrence @xcite to determine the degree of entanglement .",
    "we consider the pure and mixed state cases .",
    "concluding remarks close this paper .",
    "as mentioned above , the study of entangled states in the last decade has revived interest in the beam splitter because this device offers us an simple way to probe the quantum nature of electromagnetic field by means of simple experiments .",
    "we recall that the beam splitter is an optical element with two input ports and two output ports which , in some sense , governs the interaction of two harmonic oscillators .",
    "the input and output boson operators are related by a unitary transformation which may be viewed as an element of the @xmath2 group . recently",
    ", a quantum network of beams splitters was used to create multi - particle entangled states of continuous variables @xcite and also multi - particle entangled coherent states @xcite associated with the usual harmonic oscillator algebra .",
    "we shall first discuss a simplest beam splitters combination that enables the generation of coherent states associated with the lie algebra @xmath12 using @xmath13 different electromagnetic field modes ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "to this end , we define a sequence of @xmath1 beam splitters ( `` @xmath1-beam splitters '' ) acting as follows .",
    "the output of the first beam splitter , which is a superposition of the modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , is injected into the first arm of the second beam splitter while the second arm receives modes of quantum electromagnetic field labeled as @xmath17 .",
    "the output state of the second beam splitter is then injected in the the first port of the third beam spitter while the other port receives the photons in the mode 3 .",
    "this scheme can be generalized to an arbitrary number of beam splitters such that the output state of the each beam splitter , of the sequence under consideration , is inserted in one port of the next beam splitter while another electromagnetic mode is inserted into the other input port .",
    "the figure 1 give the schematics of this combination of beam splitters .",
    "1 : the sequence of @xmath1 beam splitters .",
    "then the unitary transformation to realize this can be expressed as the product of a sequence of beam splitter tansformations .",
    "it is given by @xmath18 where the operators @xmath19 are the ordinary @xmath2 beam splitters for @xmath20 and the angles @xmath21 are related to reflection and transmission coefficients as follows @xmath22 in the equation ( [ operatorbl ] ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand the creation and annihilation operators of @xmath13 independent bosonic oscillator .",
    "they satisfy the usual commutation rules @xmath25 = \\delta_{ll ' } , \\qquad   [ a^-_l , a^-_{l ' } ] =    [ a^+_l , a^+_{l ' } ] = 0 , \\qquad   l , l ' = 0 , 1 , 2 , \\cdots k.\\ ] ] as hilbert space let chose the infinite dimensional fock space generated by multi - mode states @xmath26 if the input state is given by @xmath27 , the action of the operator @xmath28 is given by the following fock states superposition @xmath29 where the coefficients @xmath30 stand for the matrix elements of the unitary operator @xmath31 .",
    "in general the output is a @xmath32-particle entangled state . on the other hand ,",
    "the action of the unitary operator @xmath31 on the state @xmath33 gives @xmath34 where the normalization constant is given by @xmath35 and the new variables @xmath36 are defined by @xmath37 in terms of the reflection and transmission coefficients of the beam splitters constituting the network .",
    "then , the output state ( [ suncs ] ) turns out to be the @xmath0 coherent state associated with the completely symmetric representation labeled by the integer @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , the bilinear product of creation and annihilation modes realizes ,  la schwinger , the generators of the lie algebra @xmath12 and the operator @xmath31 is nothing but a unitary displacement operator which acting on the highest weight vector @xmath39 , gives the @xmath0 coherent states in the perelomov sense ( see for instance @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this is clarified in the what follows .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the relationship between the states ( [ suncs ] ) and the @xmath0 coherent states . to do this ,",
    "it is interesting to note that the states ( [ suncs ] ) write as an expansion of the number states belonging the the restricted fock space @xmath40 which is finite dimensional . in order to show that ( [ suncs ] ) are @xmath0 coherent states",
    ", we realize the @xmath12 generators as bilinear products in creation and annihilation operators . they are given by @xmath41 and the cartan generators @xmath42 the generators @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the so - called weyl operators .",
    "the generators of @xmath12 with a non trivial action ( non vanishing and non diagonal ) on the fiducial vector ( or the highest weight vector of the symmetric representation ) are @xmath45 they can be defined from the @xmath12 generators as follows @xmath46,\\ ] ] @xmath47,\\ ] ] for @xmath48 using the raising and lowering operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the states ( [ suncs ] ) can be shown to have the displacement forms .",
    "namely , they are created by the action of the unitary displacement operators in @xmath0 acting on the state @xmath51 ( the vacuum ) .",
    "indeed , it is simply verified that the action of the unitary operator @xmath52 on the state @xmath51 gives the states ( [ suncs ] ) .",
    "this is exactly the perelomov definition of coherent states for lie algebras .",
    "thus , it is clear that the output states ( [ suncs ] ) constitutes a special class of @xmath0 coherent states .    to close this subsection ,",
    "it is important to stress that the generation of @xmath0 coherent states using the optical chain of @xmath1 beam splitters described above requires input radiation state with fixed number of photons .",
    "the experimental production of such interesting and highly non classical states has been investigated during the last decade ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently an important experimental advance was reported by hofheinz et al in @xcite .",
    "they gave the first experimental demonstration for generating photon number fock states containing up to @xmath53 photons in a super - conducting quantum circuit .      at this stage , it is natural to ask about the relation between @xmath0 coherent states obtained above and the standard glauber coherent for multi - mode electromagnetic fields .",
    "in this subsection , we shall show that he usual glauber coherent states can be obtained from the @xmath0 as a special limiting case . to show this , we rewrite the coherent states ( [ suncs ] ) as @xmath54 where the new variables are defined by @xmath55 let @xmath56 , @xmath57 in such a way that the product @xmath58 is fixed . in this limit",
    ", the coherent state ( [ zeta ] ) tends to @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the usual glauber coherent states .",
    "this limit can understood as contraction of @xmath12 algebra into @xmath1 independent weyl  heisenberg algebras .",
    "indeed , using @xmath61 @xmath62 and the relation @xmath63 satisfied by the states of the @xmath0 invariant fock space @xmath64 , one can simply verify that for @xmath38 large @xmath65 it follows that in this limiting case , we end up with @xmath1 commuting copies of usual harmonic oscillator and the states ( [ zeta ] ) gives @xmath66 where the right hand coincides with @xmath67 reflecting that , in this special case , the output state is completely separable .",
    "here we provide an optical scheme to generate multipartite @xmath0 coherent states .",
    "it clear that with @xmath68 decoupled network of quantum beam splitters , on can generate a tensorial product of @xmath0 coherent states .",
    "for instance , the special case @xmath69 corresponding to a single beam splitter where @xmath38 photons are injected into one port with only the vacuum at the other port , generates @xmath2 coherent state . to generate a multipartite @xmath2 coherent states",
    ", we consider a @xmath68 uncoupled beam splitters acting on the hilbert space @xmath70 .",
    "this is a tensorial product of @xmath71 usual bosonic fock space .",
    "the beam splitter @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , acts on the fock space @xmath74 as coupler of the modes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the action of this set of uncoupled beam splitters is described by the following transformation @xmath77 we assume that the input state of each beam splitter , characterized by the operation @xmath78 , is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary photon number .",
    "then , the input state of the entire system is given @xmath81 and one can see that the output state @xmath82 where @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) are the @xmath2 coherent states given by @xmath85 with the labeling parameter @xmath86 is expressed in terms of the reflection - transmission rate .    in a similar way",
    ", one can extend this scheme to generate states which are tensorial product of @xmath10 coherent states .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "we consider set of @xmath68 decoupled chain of beam splitters corresponding to @xmath87 .",
    "each @xmath87 chain of beam splitters is described by the unitary transformation @xmath88 acting on the three particle hilbert space @xmath89 where @xmath75 takes the integer values @xmath90 .",
    "it follows that the entire system is described by the following transformation @xmath91 the action of @xmath92 on the @xmath93-particles states of type @xmath94 gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97 are the @xmath10 coherent states defined in the previous subsection .",
    "explicitly , they are given by @xmath98 with the labeling parameters defined by @xmath99 are functions of transmission and reflection parameters .    this procedure to generate multipartite coherent states using a quantum network of beam splitters can be extended to obtain separable state involving the tensorial product of @xmath0 coherent states .",
    "the problem we raise in this section is the bipartite entanglement of the balanced superposition of two multi - particle coherent states . before embarking on our study ,",
    "it is worth making some remarks .",
    "first , it should be noted that for the most of tasks of quantum processing , one needs to generate such superpositions of multipartite @xmath2 coherent states . in the next subsection , we shall discuss their generation via kerr nonlinearity .",
    "second , to investigate the bipartite entanglement , we split the whole system in two subsystems .",
    "also , we shall focus on the multi - particle @xmath2 coherent states given by ( [ su2 ] ) generated via the scheme described in the previous section .",
    "more precisely , we consider the superposed states of the form @xmath100 , \\label{alpha;alpha}\\ ] ] to study the bipartite entanglement .",
    "it is clear that this superposition is balanced or equally weighted .",
    "the states @xmath101 and @xmath102 write as superpositions of vectors states of @xmath71 particles @xmath103 .",
    "remark that the analysis presented here can be generalized to the multipartite @xmath0 coherent states in a straightforward manner .",
    "the normalization constant in ( [ alpha;alpha ] ) is given by @xmath104 where the quantities @xmath105 for @xmath106 stand for the overlapping of @xmath2 coherent states .",
    "they are given by @xmath107^n \\label{overlap}\\ ] ] in terms of the reflection - transmission coefficients .",
    "we will employ the concurrence  @xcite as a measure of bipartite entanglement for the state @xmath108 .",
    "we recall that for @xmath109 the density matrix for a pair of qubits  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 which may be pure or mixed , the concurrence is  @xcite @xmath110 for  @xmath111 the square roots of the eigenvalues of the `` spin - flipped '' density matrix @xmath112 where the star stands for complex conjugation in the basis @xmath113 with the pauli matrix is @xmath114 .",
    "for the special case of pure state , one can show that the concurrence is @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the reduced density of qubit 1 that is obtained by tracing out the second qubit .",
    "nonzero concurrence occurs if and only if qubits 1 and 2 are entangled .",
    "moreover , @xmath117 only for an unentangled state , and @xmath118 only for a maximally entangled state .",
    "this concurrence measure can be used to study the bipartite entanglement in multipartite coherent states for pure as well as mixed state as we shall explain below .      as mentioned above",
    ", we shall discuss how to generate the balanced superposition of multipartite @xmath2 coherent states .",
    "we first focus on a single beam splitter @xmath119 with one port receives @xmath38 photons and the vacuum at the other .",
    "we assume that a kerr medium is placed in the output of the beam splitter .",
    "the kerr interaction is described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath120 where @xmath121 is proportional to the third - order nonlinear susceptibility of the medium .",
    "many authors employ an extended version where a linear term in the photon number @xmath122 is added .",
    "this linear term is irrelevant for our task .",
    "the unitary transformation associated with the kerr interaction is @xmath123 clearly , the action of the beam splitter produces the @xmath2 coherent state @xmath124 ( see equation ( [ alphacs ] ) ) where @xmath125 is related to the transmission and reflection parameters of the device . in what follows",
    "we shall assume that the time @xmath126 for the light to cross the kerr medium is such that @xmath127 .",
    "in this particular case , the action of the operator @xmath128 on the output state of the beam splitter @xmath124 gives @xmath129    this can be generalized to generate some particular superposition of multi - component @xmath2 coherent states .",
    "for this end , we use the dynamical evolution of a tensorial product of @xmath68 @xmath2 coherent states with respect the nonlinear hamiltonian @xmath130 this generalizes the single mode nonlinear kerr hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are @xmath131 here also at the time @xmath132 , the multipartite coherent state @xmath133 evolves into the state @xmath134 which is a superposition of two multipartite @xmath2 coherent states .",
    "it constitutes a special example of the balanced multipartite @xmath2 coherent states given by ( [ alpha;alpha ] ) .",
    "we now investigate the degree of bipartite entanglement in multipartite systems described by states of type @xmath135 defined by ( [ alpha;alpha ] ) .",
    "such states belong to a @xmath71 dimensional hilbert space . as simple way to tackle this issue ,",

    "since the two subsystems in the bipartite state @xmath144 are essentially two - state systems , we can characterize the entanglement of bipartite state by the bipartite concurrence that we denote by @xmath145 .",
    "it follows that one can apply the method developed in @xcite to get the concurrence of a bipartite system involving nonorthogonal states . for that end",
