    "reflective symmetries are ubiquitous in nature and in mathematics .",
    "they are central to the very earliest of mathematics in the guise of the platonic and archimedean solids , as well as to the latest endeavours of finding a fundamental physical theory , such as string theory .",
    "the current group theoretic paradigm for reflection groups is coxeter group theory @xcite , which axiomatises reflections from an abstract mathematical point of view .",
    "clifford geometric algebra @xcite is a complementary framework that instead of generality and abstraction focuses on the physical space(-time ) that we live in and its given euclidean / lorentzian metric .",
    "this exposes more clearly the geometric nature of many problems in mathematics and physics .",
    "in particular , clifford geometric algebra has a uniquely simple formula for performing reflections .",
    "previous research appears to have made exclusive use of one framework at the expense of the other . here",
    ", we advocate a combined approach that results in geometric insights from geometric algebra that apparently have been overlooked in coxeter theory thus far .",
    "hestenes @xcite has given a thorough treatment of point and space groups ( including the coxeter groups of rank 3 of interest here ) in geometric algebra , and hestenes and holt @xcite have discussed the crystallographic point and space groups , from a conformal point of view .",
    "our emphasis here lies on applying geometric algebra to the coxeter framework , in particular the root systems and representations .",
    "it has been noticed that certain root systems in coxeter group theory can be realised in terms of hamilton s quaternions @xcite  most notably the @xmath0 root system  and quaternionic representations of coxeter groups are used extensively in the literature for problems ranging from polytopes to quasicrystals and elementary particle theory @xcite .",
    "however , all that is used in this approach are the algebraic properties of the quaternion multiplication law , conjugation and inner product .",
    "it is also obvious that the quaternionic description can not extend to arbitrary number of dimensions .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the quaternionic rank-3 and 4 coxeter group representations have very simple geometric interpretations as ( hodge duals of ) vectors and as spinors , respectively , which are shrowded in the purely algebraic approach followed in the literature .",
    "we demonstrate how these structures in fact arise very naturally and straightforwardly from simple geometric considerations in geometric algebra .",
    "furthermore , the concepts of vectors and spinors readily generalise to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "there is another surprising insight that concerns the connections between the groups of rank 3 and those of rank 4 . in low dimensions ,",
    "there are a number of exceptional structures ( @xmath0 ; @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 ; @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 ) , that in the conventional approach seem unrelated . here , we demonstrate how in fact the rank-4 groups can be derived from the rank-3 groups via the geometric product of clifford geometric algebra .",
    "this is complementary to the top - down approaches of projection , for instance from @xmath0 to @xmath8 @xcite , or of generating subgroups by deleting nodes in coxeter - dynkin diagrams .",

    ", we introduce the basics of geometric algebra necessary for our discussion and set out the notation that we will use . in section [ hga_a13 ] , we begin with the simple example of the group @xmath10 as an illustration of the logic behind our approach , as it exhibits the same structural features as the later cases without most of the complexity . the geometric algebra reflection formalism is used to generate the full reflection group from the simple roots and the geometric interpretation for the rank-3 representation in terms of pure quaternions is given .",
    "the spinors resulting from successive reflections are found to be the lipschitz units , which thus induce a realisation of the rank-4 group @xmath11 that corresponds precisely to the quaternionic representation .",
    "section [ hga_a3 ] follows the same procedure in the case of @xmath2 , with the spinors ( the hurwitz units ) inducing the group @xmath6 , which is interesting from a triality point of view and central to the equivalence of the ramond - neveu - schwarz and green - schwarz strings in superstring theory . in section [ hga_b3 ] , @xmath3 is found to give rise to the @xmath7 root system , the largest crystallographic group in four dimensions . @xmath4",

    "the study of clifford algebras and geometric algebra originated with grassmann s , hamilton s and clifford s geometric work @xcite .",

    "when clifford algebras resurfaced in physics in the context of quantum mechanics , it was purely for their algebraic properties , and this continues in particle physics to this day .",
    "thus , it is widely thought that clifford algebras are somehow intrinsically quantum mechanical in nature .",

    "the geometric product is invertible , as @xmath79 is simply given by @xmath80 .",
    "this leads to many algebraic simplifications over standard vector space techniques , and also feeds through to the differential structure of the theory , with green s function methods that are not achievable with vector calculus methods .",

    "multiplying a vector with itself yields a scalar , so there is a highest grade object  called the pseudoscalar and commonly denoted by @xmath81  that one can form in the algebra , as the number of elements is limited by the number @xmath82 of linearly independent vectors available .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is not just the geometry of the orthogonal transformations that is difficult to disentangle in the quaternion formalism , but indirectly therefore also the geometry of the ( quaternionic ) roots , which generate these transformations . in the literature , there is no particular significance attached to the quaternionic representations .",
    "it is merely occasionally remarked upon that it is striking that the rank-3 groups are given in terms of pure quaternions , or that the roots of the rank-4 groups are given in terms of the binary polyhedral groups , but without any further geometric insight .",
    "here , we have shown that the pure quaternions of the rank-3 representations are merely ( hodge ) disguised vertex vectors / simple roots generating the full group of coxeter reflections , and that these generate rotor realisations of the binary polyhedral groups via the cartan - dieudonn theorem .",
    "these spinors , in turn , are the roots of the rank-4 coxeter groups which are equivalent to the simple roots of the rank-4 representations used in the literature .",
    "the main result of this paper is thus the series of theorems that the geometric product induces the relevant rank-4 groups from the rank-3 groups .",
    "we summarise the correspondences between the relevant groups in table [ tab_corr ] . in particular ,",
    "the rank-4 groups can be generated by spinor generators that do not contain any more information than the rank-3 groups :    the spinor generators @xmath207 and @xmath208 generate the four rank-4 groups from the simple roots @xmath209 of the four corresponding rank-3 groups .    despite this",
    ", it is often remarked that , for instance , the @xmath4 roots are the special roots within @xmath8 that are pure quaternions , and that these form a sub - root system @xcite .",
    "[ pureicos ] pure icosians are just the hodge duals of the roots of @xmath4 , and their product is essentially that of ordinary vectors .",
    "pure icosians are pure bivectors and therefore precisely the hodge duals of the root vectors .",
    "their product is @xmath210 .",
    "the real question is therefore not why the pure quaternions form a rank-3 sub - root system of the rank-4 group , but why the hodge duals of the vertex vectors should be amongst the spinors generated by them .",
    "this property is shared by the @xmath10 case , where the hodge duals of the vertex vectors are identical with 6 of the lipschitz units , as well as the @xmath3 case , where the 18 hodge dual root vectors are amongst the 48 elements of the binary octahedral group .",
    "however , the hodge duals of the 12 cuboctahedral vertices from @xmath2 are not among the hurwitz units . that this is not even possible for a different choice of simple roots is obvious from the form of the hurwitz units .",
    "it is only possible for @xmath3 because there , among the 24 dual hurwitz units @xmath211 , 12 are pure quaternions .",
    "however , the group @xmath6 is still induced from the group @xmath2 via the geometric product , which therefore seems to be more fundamental . obviously , @xmath2 is contained within @xmath6 multiple times , for instance , by deleting any one leg , but one can see that this can not be purely quaternionic , as the central node is essentially spinorial .",
    "the rank-3 coxeter groups can be represented by the pure quaternion part of the representations of the rank-4 groups they generate as spinors if and only if they contain the central inversion .",
    "if the central inversion @xmath81 is generated by the roots , the bivectors defined as the hodge duals of the roots are pure quaternions by proposition [ purequat ] and they have the same product as the root vectors by proposition [ pureicos ] , thus giving the required sub - root system .",
    "conversely , if the pure quaternionic representation of the rank-3 group @xmath212 is contained in the spinors @xmath213 generating the rank-4 group , then @xmath214 and thus @xmath215 is generated by the group .",
    "the coxeter group root systems @xmath216 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be realised as the pure quaternion elements of the quaternion group , the binary octahedral group and the binary icosahedral group , respectively , but @xmath2 does not have such a representation as a subset of the binary tetrahedral group .",
    "the coxeter groups @xmath216 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 contain the central inversion , but @xmath2 does not .",
    "we finally revisit the versor approach to orthogonal transformations eq .",
    "( [ in2versor ] ) .",
    "vectors are grade 1 versors , and rotors are grade 2 versors , so the reflections and rotations we have been using are examples of the versor theorem . however , when generating the root system from the simple roots via reflection , we have in fact been forming higher grade versors already .",
    "thus , for instance for @xmath4 , the simple roots generate 30 reflection versors ( pure vectors , the root system of the coxeter group ) performing 15 different reflections via @xmath217 .",
    "these in turn define the 60 rotations of the chiral icosahedral group via 120 versors acting as @xmath218 , including the hodge duals of the reflections ( 15 rotations of order 2 ) .",
    "60 operations of odd parity are defined by grade 3 versors ( with vector and trivector parts , i.e. the hodge duals of the 120 spinors ) acting as @xmath219 . however , 15 of them are just the pure reflections already encountered , leaving another 45 rotoinversions .",
    "thus , the coxeter group , the full icosahedral group @xmath220 is expressed in accordance with the versor theorem .",
    "alternatively , one can think of 60 rotations and 60 rotoinversions , making @xmath221 manifest . however , the rotations operate double - sidedly on a vector , such that the versor formalism actually provides a 2-valued representation of the rotation group @xmath68 , since the rotors @xmath198 and @xmath222 encode the same rotation .",
    "since @xmath69 is the universal 2-cover of @xmath68 , the rotors form a realisation of the preimage of the chiral icosahedral group , i.e. the binary icosahedral group . thus , in the versor approach",
    ", we can treat all these different groups in a unified framework , whilst maintaining a clear conceptual separation .",
    "the versor formalism is particularly powerful in the conformal geometric algebra approach @xcite .",
    "the conformal group @xmath129 is isomorphic to @xmath223 , for which one can easily construct the clifford algebra and find rotor implementations of the conformal group action , including rotations and translations .",
    "thus , translations can also be handled multiplicatively as rotors , for flat , spherical and hyperbolic space - times , simplifying considerably more traditional approaches and allowing novel geometric insight .",
    "hestenes @xcite has applied this framework to point and space groups , which is fruitful for the crystallographic groups , as lattice translations can be treated on the same footing as the rotations and reflections .",
    "our approach of generating the 3d coxeter groups of interest from three vectors shares some parallels with hestenes approach .",
    "it also applies to the non - crystallographic case @xmath4 , which was considered in @xcite but not in @xcite . as it is non - crystallographic",
    ", it is not immediately obvious how a conformal setup would be an improvement over @xmath101 , as we are not considering translations .",
    "there might perhaps be some interesting consequences for quasilattice theory @xcite , in particular for quasicrystals induced by the cut - and - project method via projection from higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "a detailed treatment will be relegated to future work .",
    "coxeter groups are abstract reflection groups , and clifford geometric algebra affords a uniquely simple way of performing reflections , as well as other orthogonal transformations as versors .",
    "this makes it the natural framework for the study of reflection groups and their root systems .",
    "clifford algebra provides a simple construction of the spin group @xmath224 , and in our novel construction the chiral , full and binary groups can be studied in a unified framework .",
    "specifically , here we have considered the simple roots of the rank-3 coxeter groups @xmath216 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and have generated the chiral , full and binary polyhedral groups from them through the geometric product .",
    "we believe that we have presented the simplest and geometrically clearest construction of the binary polyhedral groups known .",
    "in particular , this constructs the roots of the rank-4 coxeter groups @xmath225 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 directly from the rank-3 roots of @xmath216 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . this powerful way of inducing higher - rank coxeter groups does not seem to be known .",
    "it is particularly interesting , as it relates the exceptional low - dimensional coxeter groups @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 to each other as well as to the series @xmath155 , @xmath172 and @xmath169 in novel ways . in particular , it is remarkable that the exceptional dimension - four phenomena are seen to arise from three - dimensional geometric considerations alone .",
    "this spinorial view could open up novel applications in polytopes ( e.g. @xmath226 ) , string theory and triality ( @xmath6 ) , lattice theory ( @xmath7 ) and quasicrystals ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we have given the quaternionic representations of coxeter groups used in the literature a geometric interpretation as vectors and spinors in disguise , and clarified and streamlined the quaternionic formalism used in the literature .",
