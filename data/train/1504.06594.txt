    "in the absence of a convincing theory to explain the origin of the lepton flavor structure , different approaches have been pursued to address this question . among them",
    ", the imposition of texture zeros in the lepton mass matrices has been quite popular .",
    "the reason is two - fold .",
    "the vanishing of some matrix elements obviously reduces the number of free parameters , thus increasing , in some cases , the predictive power of the flavor patterns .",
    "furthermore , texture zeros can naturally appear in theories with an extended scalar sector in the presence of abelian symmetries  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of the phenomenological implications of lepton mass matrices with vanishing elements is well motivated on theoretical grounds .    during the last years",
    ", our knowledge of neutrino masses and leptonic mixing has been enriched thanks to the data accumulated from several solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite , as well as to cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an improved sensitivity to the dirac cp phase has emerged from the complementarity of accelerator and reactor neutrino data .",
    "it is conceivable that leptonic cp violation is observed in current and next - generation neutrino oscillation experiments , which makes the search for such effects one of the main goals of the future research in neutrino physics  @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that , in the flavor basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , neutrino mass matrices with more than two independent zero entries are not compatible with neutrino oscillation data , while seven patterns with two zeros are viable , as shown by frampton , glashow and marfatia ( fgm ) in ref .",
    "the latter contain four complex parameters , from which nine physical quantities should be determined ( three neutrino masses , three mixing angles , one dirac cp phase and two majorana phases ) , assuming that light neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "more recently , the aforementioned two - zero textures have been scrutinized ( see e.g. refs .",
    "other predictive textures can be envisaged as well in the flavor basis .",
    "the so - called hybrid textures  @xcite , having one texture zero and two equal nonzero elements , contain the same number of physical parameters as the fgm textures .",
    "a systematic analysis of such hybrid textures has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors concluded that 39 patterns for majorana neutrinos are compatible with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath1 confidence level ( c.l . ) .",
    "restrictive patterns for the lepton mass matrices can also be constructed when the charged lepton mass matrix is not diagonal .",
    "for instance , one can consider scenarios in which both matrices exhibit a ",
    "parallel \" structure  @xcite with the vanishing matrix elements located at the same positions  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , a detailed survey of texture zeros in lepton mass matrices has been performed , for both dirac and majorana neutrinos , considering parallel and non - parallel matrix structures  @xcite . in the latter study , however , the dirac phase was not included in the numerical @xmath0-analysis , which was carried out at the @xmath2 c.l ..    in this work , we perform a detailed @xmath0-analysis of several popular _",
    "anstze _ for lepton mass matrices that contain texture zeros .",
    "we aim at determining whether such patterns are consistent or not with current neutrino oscillation data at the @xmath3 c.l .. in particular , the well - known fgm two - zero textures , the hybrid textures , as well as parallel structures will be analyzed . in our fitting procedure , we take into account six neutrino observables , namely , the two mass - squared differences , the three mixing angles , and the dirac cp - violating phase .",
    "we also impose the recent cosmological bound on the sum of the neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chianalysis ] , we briefly explain our strategy for the numerical analysis and minimization procedure . then , we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fgmtextures ] to revisit the fgm two - zero textures for majorana neutrinos .",
    "two - zero textures for the lepton mass matrices in the case of dirac neutrinos are also considered . section  [ sec : hybridtextures ] is devoted to the systematic @xmath0-analysis of hybrid textures containing one - zero texture and two equal nonzero elements , for both majorana and dirac neutrinos .",
    "parallel structures with two and three zeros are studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : partextures ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nnitextures ] , predictive neutrino textures in combination with a charged lepton mass matrix exhibiting the so - called nearest - neighbor - interaction ( nni ) form are considered .",

    "leptonic mixing is described by the pontecorvo , maki , nakagawa and sakata ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite , which , in the standard parametrization , can be written as  @xcite    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , with all the angles @xmath6 in the first quadrant , @xmath7 is the dirac cp phase , and @xmath8 are two majorana phases . the unitary matrix @xmath9 in eq",
    ".   relates the mass eigenstate neutrinos @xmath10 to the flavor eigenstate neutrinos @xmath11 .    for majorana neutrinos ,",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath12 is a @xmath13 complex symmetric matrix , which can be diagonalized by the unitary transformation @xmath14 , with @xmath15 a unitary matrix and the neutrino masses @xmath16 real and positive . if neutrinos are dirac particles , then the corresponding unitary transformation is @xmath17 , in analogy to the charged leptons , for which the mass matrix @xmath18 is diagonalized by @xmath19 .",
    "the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath9 is then given by @xmath20 , which can always be parametrized in the form of eq .  .",
    "the absolute scale of neutrino masses is not yet known and there are two possible orderings of the light neutrino masses : normal ordering ( no ) with @xmath21 or inverted ordering ( io ) with @xmath22 .",
    "the spectrum may vary from hierarchical to quasi - degenerate masses .",
    "nevertheless , cosmological observations place a stringent upper bound on the sum of the masses . assuming three species of degenerate massive neutrinos and a @xmath23cdm model , the planck collaboration has released the bound  @xcite @xmath24 obtained from a combined analysis of data .",

    "] although this bound is not definite and requires confirmation by forthcoming experiments , its inclusion in the analysis of neutrino mass models may lead to important conclusions about the viability of a given model .    in this work",

    "there has been lately a revival of the interest in texture - zero models that aim at explaining the flavor structure observed in lepton mass matrices . in this work ,",
    "we have confronted various popular texture - zero _ anstze _ of lepton mass matrices with current neutrino data .",
    "we have performed a thorough @xmath0-analysis in a wide class of schemes , considering hermitian charged lepton mass matrices in combination with symmetric majorana or hermitian dirac neutrino mass matrices . in our study we included the well - known fgm textures , the so - called hybrid textures , as well as parallel patterns . we concluded that while a significant number of these patterns is still consistent with all the observations at 68.27% c.l .",
    ", there are several textures that can be excluded or are marginally allowed . we have also considered predictive neutrino zero textures with the assumption that the charged lepton mass matrix has the well - known nni form . in the latter case , requiring non - hermiticity of the charged lepton mass matrix",
    "is a necessary condition to obtain viable neutrino patterns .",
    "predictive textures were found with a maximum number of three zeros , for both majorana and dirac neutrinos .",
    "it is well known that texture - zero models have in general a weak predictive power .",
    "we have not addressed here the question of the predictability of a given texture .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the reader is referred , e.g. , to ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors attempted to identify predictive classes of texture zeros by defining numerical measures of predictability .",
    "for instance , maximally restrictive majorana textures can predict , in most cases , the effective neutrino mass parameter @xmath40 , relevant in neutrinoless double beta decays .    from our study of different lepton",
    "mass matrix textures , it becomes clear that present neutrino oscillation data does not give an explicit hint on which category of textures is more appropriate to describe the observations .",
    "the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters in upcoming experiments ( including the determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale and the dirac cp phase , and the improvement of the bounds on the sum of neutrino masses and the effective mass in @xmath41 decays ) are expected to shed some light on the flavor structure of the neutrino sector .",
    "this in turn would allow us to determine , among the plethora of texture - zero patterns , what are the most predictive textures capable of explaining the experimental data , as well as those that are disfavored or excluded at a high confidence level .",
