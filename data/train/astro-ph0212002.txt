    "in the last decade , a considerable progress has been achieved towards the understanding of the nature and evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "it is now commonly accepted that they are powered by massive black holes ( mbhs ) fuelled by material originating in the hosting dark - matter haloes and infalling from the close galactic environment in the process described as accretion .",
    "new models connecting the agn phenomenon to the hierarchical growth of haloes have been developed , based on increasingly robust theoretical background substituting phenomenology . in this frame , the masses of mbhs are usually assumed to scale with the masses of the hosting dark - matter haloes with density estimated from the press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism ( @xcite ) . the agn luminosity is supposed close to the eddington value during a `` duty cycle '' that can be as short as @xmath1 to some @xmath2 years ( @xcite ) or longer , of the order of some @xmath3 years ( @xcite ) . with time",
    ", these models have become more and more complex and complete .",
    "the accretion rate onto the mbh varies depending on the model : it can be constant or redshift - dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "the agn activity in many cases appears to be a recurrent event ( @xcite ) .",
    "the diverging opinions as to this recurrence have converged , accounting for tidal interactions and merging effects . in addition , the eddington - limited capability of mbhs to accrete mass and the progressive consumption of the hot gas available in haloes are also expected to play an important role in the evolution of agn luminosities @xcite .    in several recent papers ( @xcite and references therein ) , the joint modelling of star formation and the growth of mbhs lying in galactic nuclei has been considered in order to account for the observed correlation between the masses of the mbh and the hosting spheroid @xcite .",
    "spheroids grow through galaxy mergers , giving rise to new ellipticals , and through the mass transfer from unstable discs ( possibly not even settled down ) to bulges .",
    "although none of these processes is directly associated with the major merger ( mm ) of dark - matter haloes , some concatenation of events is believed to correlate both phenomena .",
    "firstly , mms mark the beginning of the orbital decay , through dynamical friction , of the more massive galaxies of the progenitors , which eventually merge at the center of the new halo .",
    "secondly , the shock - heated gas is redistributed and begins to cool from the central higher density region at the strongest rate ever reached during the whole halo life .",
    "large amounts of gas then fall into the central galaxy making its disc easily become unstable ( particularly at high redshifts where discs are more compact ) and transfer mass into the bulge .",
    "as the spheroid grows some mass may reach the nuclear region and feed the central mbh .",
    "we therefore expect the growth of spheroids and mbhs not only go in parallel , but also be punctuated by the rate at which dark - matter haloes form as a consequence of mms @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to tell at which extent this scenario is able to reproduce the observed properties of agn and their dependence with redshift .",
    "the models found in the literature only address partial aspects of it and often include poorly justified assumptions and rough estimates of the mbh host density . nowadays ,",
    "the development of a complete model of this kind has become feasible .",
    "in particular , accurate analytical expressions for the halo mm rate are available ( @xcite ) that can be easily implemented .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to build such a complete , physically motivated model and check the validity of the previous scenario by comparing the predicted luminosity function of quasars ( qlf ) with the most recent publicly available observations .",
    "our model is based on the three following ingredients : 1 ) an accurate expression , in terms of halo mass and cosmic time , for the halo mm rate ( sec .",
    "[ mmrate ] ) derived in the frame of the extended press - schechter model ; 2 ) the evolving properties of mbhs ( sec .",
    "[ evombh ] ) , obtained by solving analytically the governing set of differential equations established under a few simple assumptions consistent with the parallel growth of mbhs and their hosting galaxies from the hot gas available in the halo ; and 3 ) the typical lightcurves of agn associated with mbhs of different masses at different cosmic times , inferred under the assumption of an eddington - regulated accretion rate ( sec .  [ qlc ] ) . by comparing the resulting theoretical qlfs ( sec .",
    "[ qlf ] ) with the ones observed at different redshifts , the best values of the free parameters entering the model are inferred .",
    "this leads to a fully consistent analytical expression of the qlf ( sec .",
    "[ data ] ) that recovers both the observed qlf shape and its redshift evolution at intermediate and high redshifts . in the last section",
    ", we discuss the possible shortcomings of the model and the implications of our results on the process of galaxy formation and evolution . throughout the present work ,",
    "we assume a @xmath4cdm cosmology , defined by the values of the hubble constant ( in km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ) , density parameter , cosmological constant , baryonic fraction , and normalisation of the power spectrum respectively given by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the modified press - schechter ( mps ) model developed by @xcite and @xcite is a variant of the extended ps model ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) that provides an unambiguous definition of the halo formation and destruction times and other quantities , such as the halo mm rate , not available in the original extended ps model .    by definition",
    ", haloes are destroyed in mergers yielding a fractional mass increase above some fixed threshold @xmath8 ; otherwise they survive .",
    "the formation of new haloes is then consistently defined by those mergers in which all partners are destroyed and the whole system rearranges .",
    "these are the merger events we refer here to as mms . as shown by raig et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , mms are essentially binary and involve similarly massive haloes .",
    "more specifically , the halo internal structure found in high - resolution simulations @xcite is recovered @xcite provided @xmath9 .",

    "$ ] one must take @xmath23 times @xmath24 .",
    "the required total mm rate per unit comoving volume giving rise to new haloes with masses @xmath20 $ ] is therefore the integral of the latter quantity over the mass of the _ primary _ progenitor in the appropriate interval @xmath25 the behaviour of such a mm rate is shown in the left panel of [ mmrate ] .",
    "the associated formation rate , @xmath26 , defined again as a transition rate , is then equal to the mm rate given by ( [ mmr ] ) divided by @xmath27 .",
    "the goodness of the preceding expressions has been checked against simulations by raig et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we want to outline the difference between the agn host abundance resulting from the halo mm rate derived here , ( [ mmr ] ) , and that considered in the vast majority of preceding models , simply given by the ps mass function , ( [ umf ] ) .",
    "the ps mass function implies a positive evolution ( it increases with increasing redshift ) of the comoving number density of haloes with masses below the typical mass for collapse .",
    "however , this positive evolution is not enough for the predicted qlf to reproduce the strong positive evolution of the observed qlf . as shown in appendix",
    "[ kinetic ] , the halo mm rate essentially behaves as the product of two ps mass functions .",
    "this boosts the positive evolution of the predicted qlf , which is decisive in making it match the observations .",
    "the agn luminosity depends on the mass @xmath28 of the associated mbhs and the amount of mass @xmath29 they accrete ( see sec .   [ qlc ] ) . in our model",
    ", the secular evolution of the mass of a mbh corresponds to a sequence of short episodes of intense accretion , with characteristic timescale @xmath30 each , between consecutive mms typically separated by @xmath31 . since @xmath30 , essentially the duty cycle of agn ,",
    "is expected to be of the order of @xmath32 yr , we have @xmath33 ( for a redshift @xmath34 smaller than @xmath35 , see the right panel of [ mmrate ] ) .",
    "except for the @xmath30 interval after each mm , the accretion rate is thus negligible and the agn is dormant .    given the random character of mms , haloes with the same initial mass will evolve in different ways . similarly ,",
    "mbhs located in haloes of the same mass @xmath17 will be found at different growth phases .",
    "here we are not interested in modelling the stair - like ( lagrangian ) growth of any individual halo or any individual mbh , but the smoother ( eulerian ) evolution of the _ average _ mass at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , of haloes with the same initial mass and of the _ average _ properties at @xmath36 of mbhs , namely @xmath38 and @xmath39 in haloes of mass @xmath17 .    according to the definition of @xmath40 , the lagrangian evolution of the masses @xmath17 and @xmath28 of objects surviving at @xmath36",

    "however , we need to relate @xmath29 with @xmath28 . according to @xcite , we must distinguish between the eddington - limited or the supply - limited accretion regimes , depending on whether the amount of material afforded by the mbh radiating close to the eddington limit ( see sec .  [ accrmodel ] ) is larger or smaller than the one that can be accreted , respectively .    as the eddington luminosity is proportional to the mass of the mbh",
    "( see eq . [ [ edd ] ] ) and the duty cycle can be assumed , in a first approximation , with a fixed typical value , in the eddington - limited accretion regime , @xmath39 should be essentially proportional to @xmath38 , @xmath42 as shown in appendix [ team ] , for a fixed value of @xmath43 taken as a free parameter of the model and some initial conditions set by the matching solution in the supply - limited regime , the assumption ( [ k ] ) leads to analytical expressions for the wanted dependences on @xmath17 and @xmath12 of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the solution corresponding to the eddington - limited accretion regime is expected to hold at high redshifts where the amount of hot gas in haloes is large and its radiative cooling very effective owing to the high inner density of haloes . at small enough redshifts ,",
    "however , a substantial fraction of the hot gas in the initial haloes will be already consumed and the accretion of mbhs will become supply - limited .",
    "we then expect the mass accreted by mbhs after the mm of their hosting haloes to depend on the small amount of mass accreted by the galaxy at the same occasion .",
    "the evolution of the two quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 is then inseparable from that of the masses of the hot gas available in the halo , @xmath44 , and the central galaxy , @xmath45 .",
    "what do we know about the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath46 ? as suggested by @xcite , the masses of mbhs and spheroids are closely related .",
    "@xcite found a simple proportionality between the mbh mass and the luminosity of elliptical galaxies , while subsequent works have shown that the relation @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the bulge velocity dispersion of the host galaxy , gives a somewhat tighter correlation @xcite .",
    "combining the latter with the relation observed between @xmath48 and circular velocity @xcite , likely more closely related to the halo virial mass , results in a proportionality between the mbh and halo masses , @xmath28 and @xmath17 , which is also supported theoretically ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this latter proportionality might be used to infer the evolution with cosmic time of @xmath28 , during the supply - limited accretion regime , from that of @xmath17 valid at both the eddington - limited and supply - limited accretion regimes .",
    "all the previous observations refer , however , to nearby galaxies and any extrapolation to higher redshifts would be very risky .",
    "on the other hand , a definite time - evolution of both @xmath49 and @xmath50 automatically follows , in the supply - limited accretion regime , from the assumed parallel growth of @xmath28 and @xmath46 expected to occur as a consequence of halo mms .",
    "this should take place according to the following simple assumptions or approximations .",
    "i ) the baryonic component of a halo consists essentially of hot gas and one main central galaxy .",
    "note that , if the two central galaxies in the progenitor haloes merge , the new central galaxy will automatically include their baryonic masses .",
    "in contrast , we neglect those baryons locked in surviving low mass satellites .",
    "ii ) the average mass accreted by the central galaxy after a mm is roughly a constant fraction of the hot gas mass @xmath51 available at the moment of the mm .",
    "iii ) the average mass @xmath29 accreted by the mbh after some delay that can be also neglected in front of @xmath40 is a constant fraction of the mass accreted by the hosting galaxy as a consequence of the mm or , equivalently , due to assumption ( ii ) , a constant fraction @xmath52 of @xmath51 at the time of the mm triggering the whole process . besides , assumptions ( ii ) and ( iii ) lead to a constant ratio @xmath53 between the average mass @xmath28 of the mbh and the average mass @xmath46 of the central galaxy , as roughly observed .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average baryonic mass in haloes of mass @xmath17 , equal to the constant ratio @xmath56 times @xmath17 , with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the baryonic and total density parameters , respectively , and @xmath53 and @xmath52 are two free parameters of the model .",
    "the dependences on @xmath17 and @xmath12 of all previous average quantities , in particular of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in the supply - limited accretion regime are derived in appendix [ team ] by solving analytically the set of differential equations implied by the assumptions ( [ i])([iii ] ) and equations ( [ iv ] ) and ( [ v ] ) . as an initial condition it is assumed that , at some redshift @xmath59 marking the change between the eddington - limited and the supply - limited accretion regimes , all haloes have essentially the same baryonic fraction in the form of hot gas , @xmath60 .",
    "the redshift @xmath59 is taken as another free parameter of the model .",
    "in contrast , the match of @xmath28 and @xmath61 in the two regimes at @xmath59 leads to a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath62 and @xmath43 and there is no need to introduce any extra freedom in the model ( see appendix [ team ] ) .",
    "the predicted lagrangian evolution of @xmath17 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is shown in the left panel of [ mevol ] . in the plot",
    ", we represent the results obtained for haloes of @xmath63 m@xmath64 at @xmath59 , although all halo masses lead to very similar results .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath29 and @xmath28 , which initially differ by the constant factor @xmath43 , become equal shortly after @xmath59 . in the latter supply - limited accretion regime",
    ", @xmath28 is also equal to @xmath65 ( by assumption [ [ ii ] ] ) and approximates to @xmath66 as @xmath36 tends to infinity ( where all baryons tend to be locked in the central galaxy ) . on the other hand , the trend with time of the ratios @xmath49 and @xmath67 changes from strongly increasing to slightly decreasing in the passage from the eddington - limited to the supply - limited accretion regimes as a consequence of the coupling , in the latter , of @xmath29 with the decreasing gas mass fraction . but what determines the evolution of the agn luminosity is rather the eulerian evolution of @xmath28 and @xmath61 ( see sec . [ qlc ] ) , which is represented in the right panel of [ mevol ] .",
    "this plot shows that both quantities increase with increasing time until @xmath59 , where the values of @xmath28 begin to slightly decrease converging swiftly to those of @xmath29 , forming a plateau for @xmath34 below @xmath68 .",
    "let us now focus on the typical evolution , _ during one individual accretion episode _ , of a mbh with initial mass , at time @xmath12 , equal to the average mass of mbhs in haloes of mass @xmath17 at that moment , accreting a total mass of gas also equal to the average value . in order to clearly distinguish between the initial mass of the mbh , given by @xmath38 ( varying in a timescale @xmath40 ) , and the mass of the mbh during the accretion episode ( varying in a characteristic timescale @xmath69 )",
    ", we denote this latter simply by @xmath70 , without subindex bh .    as mentioned , some time after a mm of haloes we expect radial infall of material to start feeding the mbh at the centre of the new halo .",
    "this central mbh can be the result of the merger of the two mbhs in the respective progenitor haloes , since the respective central galaxies can merge and their central mbhs may eventually fall into the centre of the new spheroid ( also due to dynamical friction within the new galaxy ) and merge . but only one of these two mbhs may finally be found at the nucleus of the central galaxy . in any event , we do not need to consider the frequency of mbh mergers since the initial mass assumed for the accreting mbh , equal to the average mass of mbhs in haloes with @xmath17 at @xmath12 , implicitly accounts for it .",
    "material is expected to be supplied to the central mbh , initially in an increasing phase , then in a decreasing one , during a time of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the accretion rate @xmath71 follows a bell - shaped form @xmath72 determined by the dimensionless phenomenological function @xmath73\\,,\\label{acc1}\\ ] ] with @xmath74 the time elapsed since the beginning of accretion @xmath12 , @xmath75 , and a dot denoting differentiation over @xmath74 .",
    "the _ typical _ evolution of the mass @xmath70 of the mbh during such an accretion episode then follows by integration of ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ acc1 ] ) @xmath76 with @xmath77 equal to the integral of @xmath78 from 0 to @xmath79 @xmath80    @xmath29 and @xmath28 in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) are the evolving average properties of mbhs introduced in section [ evombh ] .",
    "the value of @xmath30 , which should be related to the dynamical properties of the mbh close environment , is difficult to tell .",
    "for this reason , we take @xmath30 as another free parameter of the model .",
    "the accretion of gas onto the mbh reactivates the agn .",
    "an accurate model of the resulting lightcurve would require a relativistic approach .",
    "but this is outside the scope of the present study , aimed merely at understanding the main trends of the observed qlf and its redshift evolution .",
    "for this reason we shall neglect any relativistic correction .    under the classical black hole paradigm ,",
    "a source with mass @xmath70 powered by spherical accretion can reach a maximum luminosity , called eddington luminosity , given by @xmath81 with @xmath82 the gravitational constant , @xmath83 the speed of light , @xmath84 and @xmath85 the mass density and electron density , respectively , of the accreted matter , @xmath86 the thompson cross - section and @xmath87 a dimensionless constant which accounts for the variations with electron energy of the compton cross - section , averaged with a standard quasar sed @xcite .",
    "if , at some radius @xmath88 at a given time @xmath89 , the luminosity exceeds the eddington limit , the radiative acceleration will exceed the gravitational acceleration and accretion will stop .",
    "this will cause the radiation to stop soon after , allowing accretion to start again , and so on . in this way",
    ", accretion and radiation will oscillate on a characteristic timescale of the order of the infall time at @xmath88 .",
    "in fact , provided that this characteristic time is short enough , the luminosity of the agn will tend to adjust to the accretion rate set by external conditions linked to the mm event , thus reaching a ( possibly time - averaged ) quasi - stationary regime .",
    "the characteristic timescales of light variations observed in agn ( years or less ) are considerably shorter than the timescale of accretion onto the mbh ( at least @xmath90 yr ) .",
    "hence , such a quasi - stationary regime should be reached swiftly during accretion .    in these circumstances , the radiative pressure at any radius @xmath88 results in",
    "a reduced effective gravity @xmath91 which we have expressed in terms of the eddington efficiency @xmath92 .",
    "the bulk of the energy release comes from the region with maximum accretion efficiency , which occurs at a radius @xmath93 corresponding to the last marginally stable keplerian orbit @xcite , with @xmath94 the schwarzschild radius and @xmath95 a proportionality factor typically ranging between one half and two or three , depending on the form of the orbit and the angular momentum ( hence , the metric , either schwarzschild or kerr ) and the topology ( simple , binary , toroidal ) of the mbh . in the present calculations , we do not distinguish however among all these possible configurations and adopt the intermediate value of @xmath96 . according to ( [ mvmnt ] ) ,",
    "the terminal infall velocity @xmath97 for accreted material is , therefore , @xmath98 since the bolometric luminosity is the kinetic energy of the accreted material converted into radiation , we have @xmath99 and , by substituting ( [ rlast ] ) and ( [ vterm ] ) into ( [ lbol ] ) and dividing it by @xmath100 , we find @xmath101^{-1}\\,.\\label{edd }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , by taking into account the definition of the eddington efficiency @xmath102 given above , we are led to the following non - linear expression for the agn bolometric luminosity @xmath103 in terms of the two functions , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , defining the accretion episode ( eqs .",

    "note that , in our model , @xmath102 is not constant along the duty cycle but , like the bolometric luminosity , it is a bell - shaped function of time taking values substantially lower than unity .",
    "the maxima of both @xmath107 and @xmath102 depend on the eulerian evolution of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see the right panel of [ mevol ] ) through ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) . from ( [ edd ] ) , we have that @xmath102 is constant as long as @xmath29 is proportional to @xmath28 , namely , during the whole eddington regime and at redshifts below @xmath68 . between these two phases ,",
    "right after @xmath59 , it diminishes with increasing time .",
    "on the other hand , from ( [ ldet ] ) we have that , as long as @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath107 is also proportional to them .",
    "therefore , the luminosity increases with time during the whole eddington - limited accretion regime and diminishes , after @xmath59 , to a constant value where @xmath28 and @xmath108 become equal .",
    "this implies a negative luminosity evolution of agn associated with haloes of a fixed mass during the eddington - limited accretion regime , a positive evolution in the initial phase of the supply - limited accretion regime until @xmath109 and a null evolution at lower redshifts .",

    ", we must simply write , in ( [ phim ] ) , the quasar reactivation rate in terms of the halo mm rate , @xmath123 with @xmath124 given in ( [ mmr ] ) , and take the functions @xmath125 as the inverse of the increasing and decreasing parts of the typical luminosity curve @xmath126 given in ( [ ldet ] ) .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath127 in ( [ nu ] ) accounts for possible inaccuracies in the assumptions adopted as well as for possible biases affecting the observational data .",
    "for example , although our model presumes one single quasar event per halo mm , this might deviate from reality ( factor @xmath128 in [ [ ni ] ] ) as there are indications that haloes may harbour more than one quasar ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . on the other hand , there are also reasons to introduce such a normalisation factor from the observational point of view .",
    "more specifically , no sample is ever free of incompleteness effects and selection biases ( factors @xmath129 and @xmath130 in [ [ ni ] ] , respectively ) .",
    "last but not least , one must take into account , in addition , the orientation of detected quasars ( factor @xmath131 in ) .",
    "all these effects should not present a strong evolution in the range @xmath132 , but be rather constant ( with eventual variations in some specific redshift ranges due to redshift - dependent observational biases ) .",
    "as several of these effects are rather uncertain , we take @xmath133 as another free parameter of the model .",
    "as explained in appendix [ team ] , we do not expect @xmath59 to substantially vary with halo mass , but the situation is less clear for the other quantities taken as constant parameters in the present model .",
    "for instance , by combining the scaling relation ( [ sp ] ) with the observed @xmath134 correlation , we could infer an expression for @xmath53 as a function of halo mass and redshift .",
    "however , letting these quantities to depend on @xmath17 and @xmath12 or on any of these variables alone would greatly complicate the task of obtaining an analytical model and would introduce too much freedom in the problem .",
    "thus , we prefer to assume them having fixed values in a first approximation .",
    "so far we have implicitly assumed that all haloes , irrespective of their mass , harbour mbhs evolving according to the model given in section [ evombh ] and that all mbhs radiate according to the model described in section [ qlc ] . but this may not be the case . only haloes in some finite mass range are likely to feed mbhs at the suited rate and reach the appropriate radiative efficiency ( the capability of converting the kinetic energy of the matter falling at @xmath135 into radiation ) .",
    "we should therefore also examine the effects of adopting a limited halo mass range , @xmath136 $ ] . in summary ,",
    "the free parameters of the model are : @xmath59 , @xmath53 , @xmath52 , @xmath30 , @xmath43 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath127 .    to find the best values of these parameters we have followed an iterative @xmath139-minimisation fitting procedure to the observed qlf , with each free parameter of the model taking values from a pre - constructed grid within certain initial intervals ( see below ) . for the following iterations ,",
    "however , the width of these intervals is progressively reduced and their centres are re - defined using the best - fitting parameter values of the former step in such a way that the free parameters are allowed to take values outside their initial intervals .",
    "( actually , the only parameters fitted in this way are @xmath59 , @xmath53 , @xmath52 , @xmath30 , @xmath43 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ; the value of @xmath127 is drawn , at each step , by taking the best simultaneous normalisation of the predicted qlfs . )",
    "the redshift @xmath59 marking the change from the eddington - limited to the supply - limited accretion regimes is initially allowed to take values in the range [ 0,10 ] .",
    "the ratio between the masses of mbhs and their central galaxies , @xmath53 , is allowed to vary in the range @xmath140 $ ] indicated by observations @xcite .",
    "contrarily to @xmath53 , the fraction of gas in the host galaxy that is accreted by the mbh at the occasion of a mm , @xmath52 , is poorly constrained .",
    "so we leave @xmath52 completely free .",
    "the timescale @xmath30 is supposed to be in the range [ @xmath141 $ ] yr bracketing the values mentioned in the literature for the duty cycle of agn .",
    "the previous bounds for @xmath30 together with ( [ edd ] ) under the approximation @xmath142 lead to a fractional mass increase , @xmath43 , of the mbh during an eddington - limited accretion episode in the range [ 0.05,50 ] .",
    "@xmath137 and @xmath138 are assumed to lie initially in the ranges @xmath143 $ ] m@xmath144 and @xmath145 $ ] m@xmath144 , respectively .",
    "finally , the normalisation factor @xmath127 is also left completely free .",
    "quasars are not always easy to distinguish from other types of objects",
    ". moreover , the different samples gathered in different wavelengths are usually small . in this concern , the 2df quasar redshift ( 2qz ) sample @xcite seems the most appropriate for our purposes .",
    "the 2qz sample is very large , uniformly selected from well - defined criteria and of high overall completeness @xmath146 to the limiting magnitude @xmath147 , after corrections for incompleteness ( see http://www.2dfquasar.org/ ) .",
    "the subsample of 2qz used here comprises some 10000 colour - selected , moderately faint ( m@xmath148 quasars , covering the redshift range [ 0.3,2.3 ] .",
    "the candidates were all point - like objects selected by their @xmath149 excess on a @xmath150 plane , introducing an abrupt decrease of the efficiency of the selection both at @xmath151 ( @xmath152 criterion ) and at @xmath153 ( due to morphological classification ) . to perform the fit , the corresponding qlfs for several redshift bins derived by @xcite assuming @xmath154 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    "have been converted ( in luminosities and densities ) to the @xmath4cdm cosmology used here and the bolometric luminosities predicted by our model transformed to absolute luminosities in the blue band by considering a constant ratio @xmath157 , inferred from a typical quasar sed @xcite .    in the left panel of [ logphi ] , we plot the predicted and observed qlfs for the best - fitting values of the parameters , listed in the second column of table [ tabres ] . in the third column of the table , we also quote the best values of the parameters for the data restricted to @xmath158 , where the model gives a much better fit ( see the right panel of [ logphi ] ) .",
    "the possible origin of the poor fit at low redshifts is discussed in section [ discuss ] .",
    "as can be seen from table [ tabres ] , all parameters take values in the respective expected ranges .",
    "the value of @xmath137 quoted in the second column is , however , essentially an upper limit since the lower error bound is not constrained by the data .",
    "this is because varying this lower mass boundary essentially modifies the fainter part of the luminosity function while , at all redshifts , the cut - off due to the limiting magnitude @xmath147 is effective at magnitudes brighter than the cut - off due to @xmath137 .",
    "besides , at low @xmath34 there is another cut - off at @xmath159 due to the selection of stellar morphologies .",
    "a more realistic model , likely giving better fits to the observed qlfs at the faint end , would require a progressive decline of the integrand in equation ( [ phim ] ) beyond some halo mass instead of a sharp cut - off at @xmath137 , although at the cost of increasing the number of free parameters .",
    "in this concern , the best value of @xmath137 should be taken with caution .",
    "the factor @xmath160 appearing in the decomposition of @xmath127 given in ( [ ni ] ) reflects two combined effects : the intrinsic properties of the objects and selection biases .",
    "the 2qz quasars are blue objects with redshifts lower than @xmath1612.3 , selected by their @xmath149 excess .",
    "therefore , this factor represents here the number of low to intermediate blue quasars over the total quasar population .",
    "several recent results based on x - ray observations ( @xcite ) show that the reddened , or _",
    "type - ii _",
    ", quasars could be as many as the blue ones detected in the optical passbands and , therefore , @xmath152 quasars could be only a fraction ( but a large one ) of the overall optical quasar population , estimated to be of the order of 50@xmath11790% .",
    "the factor @xmath131 , accounting for the orientation effects , is @xmath162 according to the unified models ( see @xcite ) . as mentioned in section [ qlf ] , @xmath163 , although ( slightly ) greater values are theoretically possible .",
    "accordingly , a most crude estimate of the value of @xmath127 gives an upper limit of 10% to within a factor of around 2 .",
    "thus , the predicted value of @xmath164 also lies within the expected range .",
    "we have also compared the predictions of our model to the very high redshift qlf , compiled from the points of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the best fit is once again satisfactory ( see [ fan ] ) , although the values of some parameters move substantially apart from those previously found ( compare column 4 with column 3 of table [ tabres ] ) .",
    "however , taking into account the large uncertainty affecting the new values , we see that such differences are not significant .",
    "in fact , the results of this high-@xmath34 fit must be taken with caution because of possible systematic effects , such as lensing , affecting the data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the small error bars associated with the values of the parameters drawn from the 2qz sample are likely underestimated since they only account , once again , for statistical errors in the observed qlfs , almost negligible in this case owing to the large number of quasars included in each bin .",
    "the only parameters that , despite all , seem to change are @xmath30 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath137 . as mentioned , we should not attach too much importance to the exact value of this latter parameter as a smooth cut - off in halo mass is likely more realistic than a sharp one .",
    "concerning @xmath30 , the tendency it shows to decrease with increasing @xmath34 was foreseeable since all physical sizes and separations become smaller and , hence , all dynamical processes go faster at higher redshifts . in particular , the typical interval between mms",
    "diminishes with increasing @xmath34 ( see [ mmrate ] ) , thus @xmath30 must also do so if the condition @xmath165 is to be satisfied .      an alternate way of estimating the best values of the parameters is matching the quasar light density over the redshift range [ 0,6 ] .",
    "note , however , that the model is very poorly constrained by the observations at @xmath166 owing to the large fraction of the quasar population that is likely to be dust - enshrouded @xcite .",
    "[ rhoqlz ] compares the model predictions with available data ( the gray - shaded region ) .",
    "the lower limit of the observations arises from the optical data by @xcite , while its upper limit is deduced from x - ray measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also include the data points coming from an estimate of the photoionisation rate based on the observed absorption spectra in high-@xmath34 quasars ( 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the data used to adjust our model are the latter ( normalised at @xmath167 ) since they are better adapted to our @xmath139 fitting procedure .",
    "caution must be paid , however , to the fact that the total ionizing flux is believed to be dominated , at @xmath166 , by that of the blue stellar population .",
    "the predicted behaviour of the quasar light density is compatible with the observed one for intermediate and high redhifts , while there is , once again , less evolution than observed at @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly enough , the best values of the parameters obtained from the fit to the estimated ionizing background , given in column 5 of table [ tabres ] , are in general close to and , in any case , compatible with those obtained from the 2qz sample at @xmath168 .",
    "the only exceptions are @xmath30 and @xmath137 .",
    "the former takes , not surprisingly , an intermediate value between those quoted in columns 3 and 4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the slightly smaller value of the latter is even more consistent than the previous ones with the lower boundary of the observed mass range of current mbh masses , @xmath169 , which corresponds to @xmath170 at the limit @xmath171 where @xmath172 .",
    "this overall good agreement might indicate that quasars are the major responsible of the ionizing background at @xmath173 where the fit is very good or , alternatively , that the ratio of the contributions to this background of quasars and young stars remains approximately constant in that redshift interval .",
    "we have developed a fully consistent analytical model of qlf from reasonable physical assumptions and used available data on the qlfs at various redshifts to fix the values of the free parameters .",
    "the predicted qlf agrees with the available observations at redshifts higher than @xmath174 .",
    "the fact that , the more accurate halo mm rate used in our model behaves essentially as the product of two ps mass functions instead of just a single one as often adopted explains the more marked positive evolution shown by the inferred qlf . yet , the evolution so predicted is not strong enough to match the observations .",
    "the qlf calculated from the adopted mm rate but assuming a mbh mass proportional to the halo mass and the associated quasar radiating close to the eddington regime fails to reproduce the observed data .",
    "a successful approach requires also modelling the typical evolution on cosmological timescales of mbhs and the typical lightcurve of agn . in the present study ,",
    "such a theoretical lightcurve rests on the assumptions of a phenomenological bell - shaped accretion rate and a physically grounded self - regulated radiation , while the modelling of the mbh growth is based on reasonable assumptions emanating from the expected connection between halo mms and the reactivation of agn .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the different samples of quasars studied with redshifts ranging from 1.27 to 6 , lead to values of the parameters that do not differ significantly .",
    "the only relevant exception is @xmath30 , the typical timescale of accretion onto the mbh , which shows a clear trend to diminish with increasing @xmath34 as actually expected .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the values found for all the parameters are very reasonable .",
    "in particular , those of @xmath30 , ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath175 yr according to @xmath34 , are consistent with the most recent estimates ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath176 is found to be @xmath177 , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "the fraction @xmath52 of hot gas that ends up in the central mbh after a mm in the supply - limited accretion regime is of a few percent .",
    "the value @xmath178 of the parameter @xmath43 determining the accretion rate in the eddington - limited regime is just what one would expect from ( [ ldet ] ) for a quasar of luminosity @xmath179 , representative of a mbh of @xmath3 m@xmath144 , and a typical accretion rate of @xmath180 during a duty cycle of @xmath3 yr . on the other hand , according to @xcite , the transition between the eddington - limited and the supply - limited accretion regimes is expected to occur at the typical formation of groups , at @xmath34 equal to 2.5@xmath1173.0 , where mms of haloes of the galactic scale become rarer and the accretion onto mbhs progressively declines . in our model ,",
    "such a transition takes place when the gas fraction in baryons becomes so low that the product @xmath181 falls below @xmath182 , thus becoming the limiting factor .",
    "this occurs at the epoch where @xmath183 , with the latter ratio taking a value of order unity , which is satisfied at @xmath184 not far from the redshifts preferred by @xcite .",
    "the hosting halo masses range from @xmath185 m@xmath144 to @xmath186 m@xmath144 , implying that quasars would be found within central galaxies of haloes from the galactic scale to the scale of galaxy groups , the structures that are currently believed to be the harbouring environments of the brightest quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the inferred fraction of observed quasars per halo mm is found to be @xmath187 510% , again pretty close to the expectations .",
    "all these results , the good behaviour of the predicted qlfs at @xmath168 and the reasonable best - fitting values of the parameters , give strong support to the proposed connection between halo mms and agn lightning through the triggered simultaneous feeding of the spheroid of the main galaxy and its central mbh .",
    "the fact that our model does not match the observed evolution of qlfs at @xmath0 is also not unexpected in this scheme because of the failure for late times of that central hypothesis .",
    "the two complementary mechanisms connecting halo mms and the reactivation of agn imply the parallel growth of the host galaxy ( by cooling flows and the merger of the main galaxies of the progenitor haloes ) .",
    "consequently , they can be expected to operate as far as haloes are typically of the galactic scale , _ when galaxies are growing_. when haloes reach the scale of galaxy groups , galaxies within them no longer grow in size , but just in number .",
    "therefore , none of the above mentioned processes may then be effective . at such late epochs",
    ", there may still be radial flows of gas into mbhs lying at the centre of galaxies , but they should be triggered by other mechanisms such as internal instabilities of galaxies or tidal interactions among galaxies within groups and clusters uncorrelated with halo mms .",
    "these results also indicate the necessity of dealing more accurately with the physics of baryons , that is , with the processes governing the evolution of the hot gas trapped in haloes , as well as with the growth of galaxies and their interactions . in other words , a qlf model spanning from high to small redshifts",
    "should necessarily be coupled to a detailed model of galaxy formation and evolution as in the recent work by @xcite .",
    "there are other simplifications in our model that might be also improved in future works , although they do not seem to play a crucial role on our main conclusions .",
    "there is , for instance , no consideration of the detailed physics at the vicinity of the mbh and our radiation model does not account for relativistic effects .",
    "detailed study of the physics around the mbh could provide , for example , a natural explanation to the decrease of the number of bright quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , the use of an isotropic model to describe highly anisotropic radiation fields around quasars is likely to introduce different kinds of biases . the first one , due to the requirement that the line - of - sight lies in the emission cone , is of purely statistical nature and should be reasonably accounted for by the normalisation of the mm rate .",
    "a second source of bias arises from the relation between the bolometric luminosity and the mbh mass , through the eddington efficiency , which assumes isotropy of the emission .",
    "this approximation , which can not be corrected by a shift of the luminosity function along the magnitude axis , results in erroneous masses associated with the observed luminosities and , therefore , in erroneous merger rates .",
    "finally , one must not forget that the comparison with observational data usually takes into account only statistical errors ( very small in such large samples as the 2qz ) .",
    "systematic effects , however , like the variations of the ability of redshift determination depending on the emission lines present inside the observable wavelenght range , are likely to have a major contribution ( @xcite ) .",
