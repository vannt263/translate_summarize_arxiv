    "one such undulatory swimmer is the biological model organism _ caenorhabditis elegans _ , a multi - cellular , free - living slender nematode worm found in soil environments .",
    "the genetics and physiology of this nematode are well - studied .",
    "its genome has been completely sequenced  @xcite and a complete cell lineage has been established  @xcite .",
    "the neuromuscular system of _ c.  elegans _ controls its body undulations which allow it to swim , dig , and crawl through diverse environments .",
    "the wealth of available biological knowledge thus makes _ c.  elegans _ an ideal candidate for investigations that combine aspects of biology , biomechanics , and the fluid mechanics of propulsion .",
    "recently , _ c.  elegans _ has been used extensively as a model system for experimental studies of propulsion , particularly at low reynolds number , due to its simple planar swimming gait and size  @xcite .",
    "the nematode generates planar bending waves through contractions of its ventral and dorsal muscles , producing a quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) traveling sinewave along its body  @xcite . at around @xmath0 in length and 75  m in diameter , _ c.  elegans _ is significantly larger than the majority of low-@xmath1 undulatory swimmers , enabling high - resolution reconstruction and analysis of planar flow fields from particle tracking data .",
    "the resulting flow - fields can be used to probe properties of both the swimmer and fluid , providing new insights into the physics of undulatory propulsion  @xcite .    .",
    "]    however , despite exhibiting a planar swimming stroke , the flow around _",
    "c.  elegans _ has a complex three - dimensional structure ( fig .  [ fig : c_elegans_3d ] ) which is difficult to capture experimentally .",
    "many useful flow properties , such as the shear rate , are dependent upon out - of - plane flow contributions not measured by planar velocimetry data ; in essence , one measures a 2d slice of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) field .",
    "this limits , for example , our ability to accurately determine drag and propulsion forces experienced and exerted by the swimming nematode . in this work ,",
    "we show that numerical and theoretical fluid mechanics techniques can be used to improve the processing and analysis of these experimental flow - fields .",
    "we first obtain detailed ( experimental ) imaging data on the shape and kinematics of a swimming _ c.  elegans _ , together with particle - tracking data for flow - field reconstruction .",
    "we then develop a numerical boundary element model of the nematode , with geometry and boundary conditions specified directly from the experiments , and use this model to improve the processing of particle tracking velocimetry results .",
    "using simulated flow - fields , we examine the spatial distribution of flow shear rate , an important quantity related to power dissipation and relevant for studies on locomotion in complex , shear - dependent fluids .",
    "we show that using purely planar data significantly underestimates the true value of the shear rate throughout the field .",
    "we then use symmetry arguments validated against numerics to show that the 2d measurements can be corrected for out - of - plane effects by applying the incompressibility constraint .",
    "our work shows that fundamental fluid mechanics tools can be used alongside experimental measurements to improve our understanding of the biomechanics of locomotion .",

    ", we use the same swimming movie to construct experimental velocity fields and to obtain the motion of the nematode , which provides the nematode s geometry and kinematics for the numerical simulations .",
    "particle tracking procedures around swimmers entail a delicate balance between maximizing the quantity of statistics from which to construct a velocity field , and the precision of those measurements . for _ c.  elegans _ , one needs enough statistics to construct a smooth , differentiable velocity field , yet the most precise particle tracking data is located strictly at the nematode @xmath2-mid - plane ( direction across the depth of field ) .",
    "additionally , due to the fact that our microscope objectives have a depth of field of approximately 20  m , our experiments represent a _ depth - averaged _ 2d slice of a 3d flow - field over this thickness .    in this paper ,",
    "simulation provides benchmark flow - fields , allowing greater selectivity for our particle identification and tracking algorithms .",
    "this selection ensures that we only choose particles close to the @xmath2-mid - plane , shifting the balance from maximizing the number of statistics to maximizing the precision of our measurements . in regions where we have limited data , we use gentle maximum value and bilateral filtering algorithms to smooth our experimental results so that they can be differentiated .    .",

    "the depth of focus of the objective is approximately 20  m , and we ensure that the focal plane is in the middle of the chamber in order to minimize wall effects .",
    "the nematode beats primarily in the observation plane ; the out - of - plane beating amplitude is less than 6% of its in - plane motion , and therefore confinement effects are minimal  @xcite . given that the flow decay is expected to be exponential , we also anticipate negligible influence of the chamber boundaries on the flow field ( see fig .",

    "this phase - averaging technique considerably improves the spatial resolution of the experimental velocity fields . in order to estimate the flow - field around the nematode s body more accurately ,",
    "we include velocities within the contour of the the swimmer - fluid interface , assuming a no - slip boundary condition .",

    "note that in the majority of implementations of the method of regularised stokeslets , the stresslet `` double - layer '' @xmath19 term in equation   is eliminated , and the constant @xmath20  @xcite .",

    "the radius @xmath38 is given as a function of arc - length @xmath39 by fitting a quadratic through the nematode s radius at the midpoint @xmath40 and the head @xmath41 , so that for a nematode of length @xmath42 we have @xmath43 the velocity boundary condition ( no - slip ) is then imposed on the mesh surface directly from experimental data via time - centered finite differences of the nematode centerline .",
    "[ fig : method ] shows the streamlines computed experimentally using particle tracking velocimetry _ ( c ) _ and numerically using simulated flow - fields _ ( d)_. these streamlines show strong agreement , with both methods capturing head and tail vortices of similar shape and size .",

    "experiments also predict a larger proportion of zero velocities , which is again associated with the difficulty of extracting smooth , small , but non - zero , velocities from noisy particle data .",
    "finally , we calculate the spatial decay of the flow speed away from the body of the swimmer . for an undulatory swimmer",
    ", we expect to observe an exponential flow decay  @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a velocity measurement , @xmath49 is the speed of the swimmer s body , assuming a no - slip boundary condition , @xmath50 is the normal distance from each velocity measurement to the swimmer s body , @xmath42 is a characteristic length - scale of the swimmer ( we take @xmath51  mm ) , and @xmath52 is an exponential parameter that specifies the rate of decay .",

    "since the beat - pattern of the nematode is planar , there is no flow in the @xmath2-direction in the swimmer mid - plane .",
    "however the @xmath2-derivatives of the mid - plane velocity will make , in general , non - trivial contributions to the shear rate .",

    ", we expect calculation of the shear rate from 2d particle tracking flow - fields will likely result in a systematic underestimate of the true 3d value . fig .",
    "[ fig : shearrate_rel_err]_a _ shows that this is indeed the case ; the spatial distribution of the relative percentage error in the simulated shear rate calculated with the 2d formula   compared with the true 3d value spatial distribution of the shear rate as calculated by the 3d   is significant , even reasonably far from the worm , and is around 30% close to the worm .",
    "indeed the integrated root mean square error in this field is 14% .",
    "thus , we see that we have significant errors throughout the field , but particularly close to the worm where calculations of shear rate are of particular interest .",
    "we wish to correct for this error without resorting to boundary element calculations , and so require estimates of the unknown quantities in the 3d formula  .",
    "since the worm kinematics is planar , we have the symmetry @xmath61 , and so there is no @xmath2-flow in the mid - plane and the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 are zero .",
    "furthermore , the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 are also zero by this symmetry . these observations are confirmed by our numerical simulation , which calculates the above quantities to be zero within numerical error .",
    "however , the @xmath2-component of the velocity @xmath66 changes sign through the mid - plane , and thus its @xmath2-derivative @xmath67 makes a significant contribution to the shear rate .",
    "the 3d formula   can thus be simplified , @xmath68^{1/2}.\\ ] ] since the flow is incompressible , we have @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 , giving the final formula @xmath71^{1/2 } ,   \\label{eq : shear_rate_planar}\\ ] ] purely in terms of planar components obtainable via planar particle tracking . applying the adjusted formula   to our numerical data ,",
    "the error is eliminated to within 0.01% which is attributable to the accuracy of our numerical scheme .",
    "the principal advantage of this approach is that it can be applied in just as simple a manner to incompressible non - newtonian flows , such as shear - thinning and viscoelastic fluids .",
    "such fluids have complex non - newtonian constitutive laws , and do not readily admit simple three - dimensional simulation .",
    "we now directly compute the 2d   and the estimated 3d   shear rate field for our experimental data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shearrate_rel_err]_b _ ) . figure  [ fig : shearrate_rel_err ] shows a comparison between",
    "the `` corrected '' 3d shear rate field from experiments and the 3d shear rate field from simulations _",
    "( c , d)_. we find the corrected field from experiments and the simulated 3d field have a strikingly similar structure and an rms error of only 14% , compared to an rms error of roughly 20% before the correction was applied .",
    "we note , however , that there are discrepancies near the head and tail of the worm , where the simulations suggest a slightly higher shear rate ( @xmath72 ) ; these regions of high velocity near the swimmer - fluid interface are in locations where we expect particle tracking techniques to pose the greatest challenge .    to quantify the differences between the shear rate fields of the simulations and experiments , as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of our correction factor for 2d data , we show the distribution of shear rate for the raw experimental data , corrected experimental data , and the full 3d simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shearrate_rel_err]_e _ ) . we find that a 2d calculation of shear rate using our experimental data underestimates shear rate for values of @xmath73  s@xmath74 compared to the 3d simulated shear rate field .",
    "when the eq .",
    "[ eq : shear_rate_planar ] is applied to the experimental data , we capture the same shear rate distribution as the 3d simulations up to @xmath75  s@xmath74 . for larger shear rates",
    "( @xmath76  s@xmath74 ) , we see only minor deviations from the 3d simulations , suggesting that the corrected shear rate field significantly improves our ability to estimate the shear rate magnitude from planar data .",
    "since the shear rate is calculated using derivatives of the velocity field , small fluctuations or errors in the velocity field are magnified substantially .",
    "nonetheless , we obtain good agreement between experiment and simulation , with errors being confined to regions of high shear rate ; importantly , we find that the application of the analytical correction factor greatly improves our estimate of the maximum shear rate around the swimmer , which is particularly useful for swimming applications with non - newtonian fluids .",
    "these results indicate that the local shear rate near a low reynolds number swimmer is likely much higher than previously thought , due to contributions in the third dimension that planar particle tracking velocimetry does not directly measure . as a result ,",
    "non - newtonian effects as a result of locomotion in complex fluids may be much larger than anticipated .",
    "examples include the role of elastic stretching , measured by the weissenberg number @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the longest relaxation time of the fluid , and shear - thinning viscosity behavior , measured by the carreau number @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a timescale that represents the onset of shear - thinning effects ; our accounting for the shear rate in the third dimension therefore suggests that a planar experimental measurement may under - represent non - newtonian effects near the body of a the swimmer .",
    "in this work , we used theoretical and numerical techniques to improve the processing of experimentally - obtained particle tracking data , producing smooth velocity fields quantifying the flow around the swimming nematode _ c.  elegans _ in a newtonian solution .",
    "we compared our results with a 3d boundary element model of the nematode , generated directly from experimentally obtained nematode kinematics , finding good agreement between numerics and experiment .",
    "we argued that when calculating derivative flow quantities , the only non - trivial out - of - plane component is @xmath67 : the @xmath2-derivative of the @xmath2-flow .",
    "this observation was validated by simulation , showing that excluding @xmath67 when calculating the flow shear rate results in a significant underestimate .",
    "accounting for the @xmath67 component via incompressibility from 2d data eliminated this error .",
    "our work illustrates how theory may be used to improve experimental measurements in biological fluid mechanics , and will be directly applicable to investigations of bio - locomotion in complex fluids .",
    "furthermore , we anticipate that as technology for the acquisition and processing of experimental flow - fields continues to improve , these out - of - plane effects will represent a hard barrier to increasing the accuracy of results , making such techniques increasingly important .",
