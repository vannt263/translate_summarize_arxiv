    "the present paper investigates general relativistic flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models with a minimally coupled scalar field with a monomial potential , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , and a perfect fluid .",
    "the perfect fluid is assumed to obey a linear equation of state , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pressure and the energy density , respectively .",
    "the adiabatic index is assumed to satisfy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 corresponds to dust and @xmath8 to radiation . when @xmath9 the matter term @xmath10 can be reinterpreted as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spatial 3-curvature of the open flrw model , i.e.",
    ", @xmath9 leads to equations that are the same as those for a scalar field in open flrw cosmology .",
    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to a matter content described by a cosmological constant , i.e. , @xmath14 , while @xmath15 describes a stiff perfect fluid ; both cases are associated with significant bifurcations , and we therefore refrain from discussing them .",
    "the einstein and matter field equations for these models are given by    [ hphieq ] @xmath16    here an overdot signifies the derivative with respect to synchronous proper time , @xmath17 ; @xmath18 is the hubble variable , which is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the cosmological scale factor , and throughout we assume an expanding universe , i.e. @xmath21 , where @xmath18 is related to the expansion @xmath22 according to @xmath23 . we use ( reduced planck ) units such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the speed of light and @xmath26 is the gravitational constant ( in the inflationary literature the gravitational constant @xmath26 is often replaced by the planck mass , @xmath27 ) .",
    "heuristically eq .",
    "can be viewed as an equation for an anharmonic oscillator with a friction term @xmath28 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath29 toward the future in an oscillatory manner , which is indeed correct .",
    "this qualitative picture , however , does not show how this comes about in a quantitative way , nor how the fluid affects the situation via its influence on @xmath18 . running the time backwards allows one to heuristically",
    "interpret @xmath28 as an energy input , which suggests that the scalar field oscillates with increasing amplitude toward the past , but this picture breaks down in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "even though this is beyond the planck regime , this limit is also needed in order to describe the classical behavior at early times after the planck epoch .",
    "furthermore , eq .   yields that @xmath31 where @xmath32 an @xmath33 are constants , and hence @xmath34 at late times while @xmath35 at early times .",
    "note that the above qualitative considerations say nothing about how e.g. @xmath36 behaves asymptotically , i.e. , if the model is fluid or scalar field dominated , or neither , asymptotically . nor",
    "does the above say anything about the role of the so - called attractor solution in a global solution space setting .",
    "this exemplifies that there is a need for a more careful examination , which is illustrated by some previous heuristic considerations for a scalar field with a monomial potential by e.g. turner  @xcite and mukhanov  @xcite p. 242 , which in turn inspired the rigorous work by rendall  @xcite ; in addition de la macorra and piccinelli introduced a new heuristic approach to study dynamics at late times for a scalar field with a monomial potential and a perfect fluid  @xcite ; rigorous work in this context was also obtained for the special case @xmath37 by giambo and miritzis  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this still leaves room for improvements and extensions , and , as will be shown in this paper , it is possible to shed light on interesting previously neglected physical and mathematical aspects .",
    "the main purpose of this paper in , primarily , mathematical cosmology is two - fold : firstly , to obtain a global visual picture of the solutions space , thus , e.g. , situating the so - called attractor solution in a global solution space context . secondly , to prove issues concerning asymptotical behavior at late and early times .",
    "this includes introducing averaging techniques to determine late time behavior , generalizing and simplifying earlier proofs in the literature , and using center manifold theory to rigorously derive approximations for the attractor solution at early times , as well as clarifying the physically important issue of asymptotic self - similarity .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce our new three - dimensional dynamical systems reformulation of the field equations on a relatively compact state space .",
    "we also present two other complementary dynamical systems formulations of the field equations , which allow us to effectively obtain approximations for the attractor solution . in section  [ sec : globaldynsys ]",
    "we apply global and local dynamical systems techniques to obtain a complete and illustrative picture of the solution space and its properties , including asymptotics . in particular",
    ", we introduce averaging techniques in our global dynamical systems setting , which allows us to prove the following theorem :    [ theorem ]    it should be pointed out that similar conclusions have been reached heuristically with quite different arguments in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , giambo and miritzis gave a proof for @xmath37 for the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) in  @xcite ( in the case of general relativity ) .",
    "however , apart from that our proof rigorously generalizes previous results , our method can , in principle , be modified to treat even more general situations .",
    "moreover , we tie our results to the global dynamical systems picture and discuss their physical implications , e.g. , situating them in the context of future manifest asymptotic self - similarity breaking . in section  [ sec : attrappr ] we focus on the attractor solution , where we introduce and compare several approximation schemes , such as center manifold and slow - roll based expansions and pad approximants , in order to describe it quantitatively .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : concl ] contains some general remarks , e.g. about the de sitter solution on the unphysical boundary of the state space .",
    "our main global ( i.e. compact ) dynamical systems formulation is based on the dependent variables @xmath38 , which are defined as follows :    [ vardef1 ] @xmath39 where @xmath40    in addition it is of interest to define @xmath41 to introduce a new suitable time variable we note the following : at early times it is natural to use a hubble - normalized time variable @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 , due to that the expansion @xmath44 provides a natural variable scale when @xmath45 via the raychaudhuri equation , as further discussed in e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ( in an inflationary context @xmath42 is often interpreted as the number of @xmath46-folds @xmath47 ) . at late times the square root of the second derivative of the potential , @xmath48 ( for simplicity we here incorporate @xmath49 into @xmath50 ) , provides a natural variable ( mass ) scale . due to the gauss constraint  , which relates a scale given in @xmath50 to one given in @xmath18 according to @xmath51",
    ", this scale can be expressed in terms @xmath18 according to @xmath52 which leads to a dimensionless time variable @xmath53 defined by @xmath54 , where the constant have the same dimension as @xmath55 . to incorporate these features in a global dynamical systems setting",
    "we introduce a new time variable @xmath56 that interpolates between these two regimes , @xmath57 where @xmath58 when @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the above leads to the following three - dimensional dynamical system for @xmath61 : has been used ubiquitously in the scalar field literature ( often denoted by @xmath62 ) , while @xmath63 was used in  @xcite where it was denoted by @xmath64 , however , as far as we know , the variable @xmath65 and the independent variable @xmath56 are new .",
    "the reason for the name @xmath66 is that mathematically this variable plays a role that is reminiscent to that of hubble - normalized shear , which is usually denominated by @xmath67 in anisotropic cosmology , for a number of situations ( the subscript @xmath68 follows the notation in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus the present nomenclature is designed to pave the way for eventually situating the present problem in a broader context than isotropic scalar field cosmology . ]",

    "above we have also introduced an effective equation of state parameter @xmath74 for the scalar field which is defined according to @xmath75 from the above relations it follows that @xmath76 .",
    "in addition it is of interest to give the following auxiliary evolution equation for @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 the state space @xmath80 associated with eq .",

    "we analytically extend @xmath80 to the state space @xmath87 by including the unphysical invariant submanifold boundaries @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "although these boundaries are unphysical , we stress that it is essential to include them since they describe the past and future asymptotic states , respectively , of all physical solutions .",

    "note also that the dynamical system   is invariant under the discrete symmetry @xmath94 , leading to a double representation of the physical solutions when @xmath95 , which is a consequence of that the potential is invariant when @xmath96 .",

    "the system   admits the following conserved quantity when @xmath140 : @xmath141 which determines the solution trajectories on the @xmath88 subset , see figure  [ fig : t0 ] .",
    "the equations on the subset @xmath89 are given by    [ dynsyst1 ] @xmath142    this system has a non - hyperbolic fixed point , @xmath143 with three zero eigenvalues .",
    "fortunately @xmath144 resides at the intersection of two invariant subsets : the invariant subset @xmath89 and the invariant perfect fluid subset @xmath139 , and thus , since @xmath65 is monotone in @xmath80 , @xmath144 attracts at least this orbit .",

    "the fixed points @xmath128 are hyperbolic sources ; it follows from the invariant submanifold structures that there exists a 2-parameter set of solutions entering the interior of the cylinder with @xmath147 from each fixed point @xmath128 , while a 1-parameter set of solutions originate from each fixed point @xmath128 into the boundary subset @xmath85 .    _ on _ the subset @xmath88 linearization of the system   gives    @xmath148    and hence @xmath149 are hyperbolic sinks on @xmath88 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : t0 ] . in the full state space , however ,",
    "each equivalent fixed point @xmath149 have an additional zero eigenvalue associated with a one - dimensional so - called center manifold .",
    "fortunately , the center direction lies on the @xmath85 subset , and hence we can investigate the center manifold by means of the unconstrained system  , which will be done in section  [ sec : attrappr ] .",
    "there we show that the center manifold of each ( equivalent ) fixed point @xmath149 corresponds to a single solution that enters the state space @xmath85 ( we will even obtain approximate expressions for this solution ) , and this solution , which hence resides on @xmath150 , is what is often referred to as the ` attractor ' solution . in the full state space",
    "@xmath138 the fixed points @xmath131 are thus center - saddles .    from these considerations , in combination with the monotonicity of @xmath65 , it follows that all solutions are _ past asymptotically self - similar _ in the sense that all physical geometrical scale - invariant observables , such as the deceleration parameter @xmath70 , are asymptotically constant .",
    "however , there is a twist to this .",
    "the geometry of a flat flrw pure perfect fluid cosmology with a linear equation of state and the geometry of a pure massless scalar field are geometries that admit a proper spacetime transitive homothety group , and such spacetimes are invariant under scalings of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "this is the underlying reason why they can be represented by fixed points , but not all fixed points are associated with geometries admitting proper spacetime transitive homothety groups , as exemplified by the de sitter spacetime . for these spacetimes homothetic scale - invariance is broken by the dimensional cosmological constant , but the 1-parameter set of de sitter spacetimes ( parameterized by @xmath151 ) admits a scaling ( self - similar ) property that scales @xmath151 ( i.e. , a scaling that maps one de sitter spacetime to another with a different @xmath151 ) , and it is due to this scaling property de sitter spacetimes can appear as fixed points .    in the present case",
    "the fixed points are not in the interior physical state space , but on the unphysical boundary , but they are nevertheless characterized by e.g. the same value of @xmath70 as the associated physical spacetime .",
    "the fact that they in the present context appear on the unphysical boundary has consequences , which we will come back to in a discussion about the de sitter fixed points in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "finally we point out that , apart from a set of measure zero , all solutions originate from a massless scalar field state and hence the present models are _ past generically massless scalar field dominated_.      the equations on the @xmath89 subset , i.e. equation  , are equivalent to that of   when setting @xmath152 , i.e. this problem is _ exactly _ that of an anharmonic oscillator ( when @xmath97 ; for @xmath37 the problem is that of a harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    ", which yields @xmath153 we will now apply the approximate ideas in mukhanov  @xcite to the present exact problem of an anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we therefore first multiply the above equation with @xmath63 and rewrite it as @xmath154 each periodic orbit is characterized by a constant value of @xmath77 and has an associated time period @xmath155 . the time average of a function @xmath156 over a period for a periodic orbit characterized by @xmath77",
    "is given by @xmath157 taking the time average of eq .",
    "for a periodic orbit gives @xmath158 where we for notational convenience from now on drop the subscript @xmath77 .",
    "again , note that in contrast to the result in  @xcite , this is an exact relation _ on _ the subset @xmath89 . using this result on @xmath89 for a periodic orbit in the definition of @xmath74 yields",
    "@xmath159 which together with   leads to @xmath160 on the subset @xmath89 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath161 is independent of @xmath77 .",
    "it therefore follows that on average , in the above sense , e.g. @xmath37 and @xmath110 on @xmath89 correspond to dust and radiation , respectively .",
    "note that the result   coincides with the approximate heuristic results using proper time given in  @xcite and  @xcite ; see also  @xcite for a quite different precise definition of @xmath162 , which still yields  .    before continuing",
    "it is instructive to consider a model that consists of two perfect fluids with constant equation of state parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "then @xmath165 ( this expression follows from that @xmath166 , but it can also be obtained from the equation @xmath167 ) . since it is not difficult to show that @xmath168 toward the future it follows that @xmath169 if @xmath170 ; @xmath171 if @xmath172 ; @xmath173 if @xmath174 , i.e. , the fluid with the softest equation of state dominates toward the future .    _ assuming _ that asymptotically @xmath74 can be replaced with the asymptotic averaged result @xmath175 in eq .   results in @xmath176 which suggests theorem  [ theorem ] , given in the introduction , but this is of course no proof .",
    "next we introduce averaging techniques that are subsequently used to provide the proof of this theorem .",

    "a perturbation parameter @xmath177 plays the key role : roughly speaking , a differential equation of the form @xmath178 for @xmath179 is approximated by the averaged equation at @xmath180 , i.e. , @xmath181 , where the average @xmath182 is defined in eq .  .",
    "furthermore , the error @xmath183 has to be controlled . in the problem at hand",
    ", we consider the differential equations in the variables @xmath184 and @xmath65 , where the role of the parameter @xmath177 is played by @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , after setting @xmath186 we have to prove an averaging theorem for the case where @xmath177 is not a parameter , but a variable that slowly goes to zero .",
    "the evolution equation of @xmath184 is given in eq .  , which in terms of @xmath177 takes the form @xmath187 where @xmath188 .",
    "this formulation is problematic due to that @xmath189 is not well - defined when @xmath77 is zero .",
    "we therefore use the following formulation :    [ ophieps ] @xmath190    where @xmath191 solves the system  , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 the general idea of averaging is to express @xmath184 as @xmath194 and prove that the evolution of the variable @xmath64 is approximated at first order by the solution @xmath195 of the averaged equation .",
    "for that , consider the average as defined in eq .",
    "of the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "more precisely , considering an equation of the form @xmath196 with @xmath56-periodic @xmath197 of period @xmath198 , the averaged equation is given by @xmath199 , where @xmath200 .",
    "according to  , we have @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is a constant that does not depend on @xmath77 .",

    "in this section we will introduce and compare several analytical approximation schemes that describe the attractor solution . since the two equivalent attractor solutions are just the center manifolds of @xmath131 , we begin with a direct approach of approximately obtaining these center manifolds by means of center manifold theory . for presentations of center manifold analysis , see e.g. ,  @xcite , and for applications in cosmology , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
