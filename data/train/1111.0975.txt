    "-.3 cm jets are observed in young stellar objects , post - agb stars and in other astrophysical objects .",
    "models suggest that jets are launched and collimated by accretion , rotation and magnetic mechanisms ( pudritz et al .",
    "magnetized jets have recently been formed in laboratory experiments ( lebedev et  al .",
    "the importance of the magnetic fields relative to the flows kinetic energy divides jets into ( i ) poynting flux dominated ( pfd ; shibata & uchida  @xcite ) , in which magnetic fields dominate the jet structure , ( ii ) magnetocentrifugal ( blandford & payne  @xcite ) , in which magnetic fields only dominate out to the alfvn radius .",
    "the observable differences between pfd and magnetocentrifugal jets are unclear , as are the effects that cooling and rotation have on pfd jets .",
    "-.3 cm we use the adaptive mesh refinement code astrobear2.0 ( cunningham et  al .",
    "@xcite ) to solve the equations of radiative - mhd in 3d .",
    "the grid represents 160@xmath0160@xmath0400au divided into 64@xmath064@xmath080 cells plus 2 adaptive refinement levels .",
    "initially , the molecular gas is static and has an ideal gas equation of state ( @xmath15@xmath23 ) , a number density of 100cms@xmath3 and a temperature of 10000k .",
    "the magnetic field is helical , centrally localized and given by the vector potential ( in cylindrical coordinates ) @xmath4 \\hat{\\phi } + [ \\alpha/8 \\,(cos(2r ) + 1 ) ( cos(2z ) + 1 ) ] \\hat{k}$ ] , for @xmath5 30au , and @xmath60 elsewhere .",
    "@xmath740 , has units of length and determines the ratio of toroidal to poloidal magnetic fluxes .",
    "the magnetic pressure exceeds the thermal pressure inside the magnetized region .",
    "source terms continually inject magnetic or kinetic energy at cells @xmath830au .",
    "we carry out 4 simulations : an adiabatic , a cooling ( dalgarno & mccray  @xcite ) and a rotating ( keplerian ) pfd jet , as well as a hydrodynamical jet .",
    "the latter is constructed to have same time average propagation speed and energy flux as the adiabatic pfd jet .",

    "-.3 cm magnetic pressure pushes field lines and plasma up , forming magnetic cavities with low density .",
    "the adiabatic case is the most stable .",
    "pfd jets decelerate relative to the hydro one ; the pfd case produces not only axial but radial expansion .",
    "pfd jet cores are thin and unstable , whereas the hydro jet beam is thicker , smoother and stable .",
    "the pfd jets are sub - alfvnic .",
    "their cores are confined by magnetic hoop stress , while their surrounding cavities are collimated by external thermal pressure .",
    "pfd jets carry high axial currents which return along their outer contact discontinuity .",
    "the pfd jets develop current - driven perturbations which are amplified by cooling , firstly , and by rotation , secondly , for the regimes studied .",
    "-.3 cm pfd jet beams are lighter , slower and less stable than kinetic - energy dominated ones .",
    "we predict characteristic emission distributions for each of these .",
    "current - driven perturbations in pfd jets are amplified by cooling , firstly , and base rotation , secondly : shocks and thermal pressure support are weakened by cooling , making the jets more susceptible to kinking .",
    "rotation amplifies the toroidal magnetic field which also exacerbates the kink instability .",
    "our simulations agree well with the models and experiments of shibata & uchida  ( @xcite ) and lebedev et  al .",
