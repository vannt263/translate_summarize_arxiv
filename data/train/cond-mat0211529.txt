    "clusters of the semiconducting group iv elements are interesting not only for their potential technological applications , but also from a fundamental point of view . small clusters of si , ge , and sn have an unusual size - dependent structural evolution .",
    "ion mobility measurements@xcite revealed that for small sizes the clusters are prolate , with aspect ratios up to three , but undergo a rearrangement to a more compact , spherical form at a size of a few tens .",
    "the rearrangement is rather abrupt for si and ge , but more gradual for sn .",
    "density - functional theory ( dft ) studies of ground - state structures and optical response@xcite confirmed the prolate shape of the small sizes and showed further that many of the ground - state structures in this size range contain the tricapped trigonal prism ( ttp ) unit , a nine - atom unit consisting of a triangular prism capped by one atom on each of the three side faces .",
    "recently , interest was focused on the thermodynamics of the prolate sn clusters after shvartsburg and jarrold@xcite found evidence , based on measurements of ionic mobility , that these clusters remain solidlike at temperatures up to at least 50  k _ higher _ than the melting point of bulk sn [ @xmath2  k ] .",
    "this is the only example so far observed of a small particle melting at a higher temperature than the bulk .",
    "it contradicts the standard paradigm , based on thermodynamic arguments , that a cluster should melt at a lower temperature than the bulk because of the effect of the cluster surface.@xcite many examples of a melting - point depression for clusters of mesoscopic size ( greater than a few thousand atoms ) have been demonstrated experimentally,@xcite and recently a depression was also observed for small na clusters in the size range of 50 to 200.@xcite    there have been a few dft studies that have implications for the thermodynamics of sn clusters .",
    "et al._@xcite carried out simulated - annealing studies of sn@xmath3 clusters ( @xmath4 ) , within the local - density approximation ( lda ) , in which the clusters were cooled from a random atomic configuration at 1980  k down to 0  k in 22  ps . by following the root - mean - square atomic displacements as a function of time",
    ", they found that the final ground - state geometries were reached roughly half way through the annealing process , at about 1000  k , for @xmath5 .",
    "et al._@xcite calculated energies of some low - lying isomeric structures within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation functional , and pointed out that the binding energy per atom was unusually high , only about 11% less than that of the bulk .",
    "finally , we studied the thermodynamics of the sn@xmath1 cluster,@xcite the smallest sn cluster whose ground state displays the ttp unit .",
    "using dft in the lda , we found the ttp unit to break up for temperatures of about 1600  k or higher , yielding a broad peak in the canonical specific heat around 2300  k.    in this paper , we revisit the thermodynamics of sn clusters in greater detail .",
    "prolate structures are identified in ion mobility experiments by having a smaller mobility than a spherical structure .",
    "shvartsburg and jarrold@xcite observed that the mobility of sn@xmath6 clusters ( @xmath7 ) remained small even at 50  k above the bulk melting point .",
    "they argued that , if the clusters had melted , they would have collapsed to a more compact , spherical form , observable by an increase in mobility , contrary to the actual observation .",
    "now , the cluster sn@xmath1 , which we studied earlier,@xcite contains just one ttp unit and already has a compact structure both in its ground state and in high - temperature liquidlike states .",
    "thus one would not expect to be able to detect its melting in a mobility experiment .",
    "we have therefore extended our methods to treat a cluster of twice the size , sn@xmath0 . in its ground state",
    ", sn@xmath0 has a prolate structure , with an aspect ratio of about 2.5 , consisting of two ttp units stacked end to end . in this paper",
    "we study the structural rearrangements , caloric curve , and electronic properties of this prolate cluster , and contrast the results with those of sn@xmath1 .    as in our earlier",
    "paper,@xcite we use _ ab initio _ born - oppenheimer molecular dynamics , within the lda of dft , and norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "this first - principles treatment of electronic structure is highly desirable , since the directional covalent bonding in small sn clusters would be hard to describe reliably by a parametrized potential , simultaneously for the ground state and for the higher - lying isomers and liquidlike forms crucial for understanding the melting properties .",
    "despite the computational expense of _ ab initio _ approaches , we obtain a sufficiently long statistical sampling of the ionic phase space as to converge the canonical specific heat to of order 10% , as extracted from a multihistogram fit .",
    "our _ total _ sampling time is of order 1  ns .",
    "we believe that this statistical convergence criterion on the specific heat gives us a good sampling of the various dynamical and rearrangement processes of the cluster as a function of temperature .    as we shall see , the sn@xmath0 cluster undergoes a number of dynamical processes as a function of temperature .",
    "one of these is a collapse of the prolate structure toward a more spherical , disordered structure .",
    "this collapse , which is the point where an increase in ionic mobility would be observed , occurs about 700  k above the bulk melting point in our lda model .",
    "thus our calculations confirm , and explain , the experimentally observed stability of the prolate form at 50  k above the bulk melting point.@xcite however , at lower temperatures , of order the bulk melting point or lower , we also find a large number of dynamical processes that lead to a permutational rearrangement of the atoms of the cluster , but which preserve the overall prolate shape and would therefore be unobservable in a mobility measurement .",
    "since we perform dft calculations of electronic structure for every ionic configuration in our thermal ensembles , we can also study electronic properties as a function of temperature . noting that solid bulk sn undergoes a phase transition at 286  k between a low - temperature covalent form and a higher - temperature metallic form , we examine the bonding characteristics of the various isomers of sn@xmath0 using the electron localization function@xcite ( elf ) .",
    "the bonding is found to be predominantly covalent at all temperatures considered .",
    "however , the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( homo - lumo gap ) is reduced dramatically during the collapse of the prolate structure .",
    "finally , although we study only sn clusters in this paper , we expect that a large number of our results would be qualitatively similar for si and ge clusters , since the structure and bonding of these clusters is similar to those of sn .",

    "[ fig1](b ) ] with nonprolate , compact geometries indicating that the ttp units have lost their identity . in fig .",

    "the most symmetric structure ( proposed as the ground state in ref .  ) is slightly higher in energy than our lowest - energy structure .",
    "the only difference in these two structures is the relative orientation of the ttp units .",

    "[ fig1](a ) ] having excitation energies of order 0.01  ev per atom relative to the ground state .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a recent study@xcite has found the most stable structure of si@xmath0 to be very similar to that for sn@xmath0 found in the present work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we have shown two nonprolate equilibrium geometries having a difference in binding energy with respect to the ground state of about 0.1  ev per atom",
    ". these nonprolate structures are somewhat disordered , although some basic units such as tetrahedra , trigonal prisms , pentagonal bipyramids , etc .",

[ fig1](c ) is an intermediate structure observed during the transition from prolate to nonprolate . in this geometry , one ttp unit is intact while the other is completely destroyed . this structure is 0.075  ev higher in binding energy per atom compared to the ground state .",
    "= 6.0 cm    it is of considerable interest to investigate the nature of bonding in the sn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "it may be recalled that at room temperature bulk sn exists in a metallic phase ( white tin ) , while in our previous work @xcite we have shown sn@xmath1 to be a covalently bonded cluster . while we therefore expect the bonding within a ttp unit in sn@xmath0 to be covalent",
    ", it is interesting to examine the bonding between the ttp units . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show isosurfaces of the elf taken at two different values of @xmath30 for a typical prolate structure .",
    "recall that a higher value of the elf , approaching unity , indicates a localized distribution of valence electrons .",
    "we note that the isosurface for the higher value @xmath31 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , connects the sn ions within each ttp unit along the line joining them , implying that the ions within each ttp unit are covalently bonded .",
    "however , this higher - value isosurface of the elf does not connect the two different ttp units .",
    "the bonds between the two ttp units are only observed at a rather lower elf value @xmath32 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "evidently the two ttp units are weakly bonded to each other compared to the bonding within a ttp unit .",
    "this leads to a number of low - lying isomers with nearly degenerate energies , of which some are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , and which as noted above differ in the relative orientation of the ttp units .",
    "= 7.5 cm    turning to the canonical ionic specific heat ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , we note some interesting features . first , the main peak in the specific heat , often identified with the `` melting '' of the cluster , occurs around 1200  k , much higher than the bulk melting point ( 505  k ) .",
    "second , there is also a small peak around 500  k and a shoulder around 800  k. these features can be explained by examining the microscopic processes as a function of temperature . at low temperatures ( below 400  k ) , the only motion observed is a change in the relative orientation of the two ttp units , which spans the class of low - lying isomers [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] having two distinct ttp units .",
    "however , at around 500  k , the atoms within each ttp unit start to rearrange themselves in such a way that the ttp structure remains intact , but undergoes a reshuffling of at least three atoms in every rearrangement , including an interchange of capping atoms with atoms of the trigonal prism core .",
    "this process is similar to the one observed in sn@xmath1.@xcite since this rearrangement does not distort the ttp unit , the shape of the cluster remains prolate .",
    "the distortion of the ttp units themselves begins around 800  k. starting at this temperature , we observe that at least one of the ttp units may be seriously distorted at various points in the dynamics , to the extent of losing its identity .",
    "the onset of these processes at 500  k and 800  k is responsible for the features seen in the canonical specific - heat curve .",
    "= 7.5 cm    this is also reflected in the potential - energy distributions ( ped ) for these temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show normalized ped for a series of temperatures starting at 400  k and going up to about 1300  k. let us recall that the ped @xmath33 at temperature @xmath21 follows the gibbs distribution @xmath22 , where @xmath34 is the canonical partition function and @xmath15 is the density of accessible states . an examination of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] reveals a slight relative broadening of the ped around 800  k , indicating that other modes of excitation are also available at this temperature , apart from the relative orientation of the ttp units and the internal rearrangements within the ttp units that take place at lower temperatures .",
    "this broadening is reflected in the ionic specific heat as a shoulder around 800  k.    as the temperature rises above 800  k , the relative motion between the two ttp units becomes more vigorous .",
    "the ttp units , apart from undergoing internal distortion , also start to come sufficiently close to one another as to initiate the exchange of atoms .",
    "this process ultimately leads at about 1200  k to the collapse of the prolate structure toward a more compact structure such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "in fact , in the temperature range 1200 to 1300  k , we occasionally observe that the collapsed structure reforms into a prolate structure .",
    "thus the time scale at these temperatures for `` hopping '' between a prolate and a more compact structure is of the same order of magnitude as that of our sampling runs , namely , about 40  ps .    to summarize , there are three main modes of ionic motion observed during our simulations up to 1200  k : ( i ) changes in the relative orientation of two sn@xmath1 units , ( ii ) an internal rearrangement of ions within each ttp unit , observed after 500  k , and ( iii ) the distortion of at least one ttp unit accompanied by the interchange of atoms between the two ttp units , observed after 800  k , leading ultimately to the fusion of the ttp units and a shape change at 1200  k.    = 7.5 cm    since it is the collapse of a prolate shape toward a more spherical shape that causes a change in the diffusion coefficient in an ion mobility experiment,@xcite it is interesting to investigate these shape changes more explicitly . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the thermally averaged value of the deformation coefficient @xmath35 , calculated for temperatures ranging from 200 to 3000  k , and averaged over 35  ps for each temperature . for a given ionic configuration ,",
    "@xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the eigenvalues , in descending order , of the quadrupole tensor @xmath38 here @xmath39 and @xmath40 run from 1 to 3 , @xmath41 runs over the number of ions , and @xmath42 is the @xmath39th coordinate of ion @xmath41 relative to the cluster center of mass .",
    "we note that @xmath35 will be unity for a spherical cluster and greater than unity for prolate deformations . at very low temperatures",
    ", we see that @xmath43 , corresponding to the ground - state structure in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , which can be regarded roughly as having a uniaxial prolate deformation with aspect ratio @xmath44 .",
    "this value of @xmath35 is maintained until about 800  k , where fluctuations are observed , corresponding to the distortion of one or both ttp units , as described above . however , the cluster still maintains an overall prolate shape until about 1250  k , when there is a very sharp drop in @xmath35 toward a value of about 2 to 3 , which is maintained up to temperatures of 3000  k or more .",
    "this drop corresponds to the fusion of the two ttp units to give the more spherical shapes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in discussions of cluster `` melting '' phenomena , it is often useful to consider the root - mean - square bond - length fluctuation @xmath45 , defind as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of ions in the system , @xmath48 is the distance between ions @xmath41 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 denotes a time average over the entire trajectory .",
    "the calculated @xmath51 is shown in fig .",
    "it can be observed that the traditional lindemann criterion of @xmath52 signaling bulk melting is reached quite early , around 650  k. this happens because @xmath51 is sensitive to the permutational rearrangement of ions within a ttp unit that occurs at these temperatures .",
    "this highlights the difficulty of giving a precise definition of `` melting '' in a small cluster .",
    "in the temperature range 400 to 1300  k , sn@xmath0 undergoes a series of complex rearrangement processes . in some sense",
    ", an individual ttp unit could be said to have melted already at 500  k , since after a sufficiently long time the reshuffling motion found at this temperature allows ions to permute throughout a ttp unit .",
    "after about 800  k , when movement of ions between the two ttp units becomes possible , ions can permute throughout the whole cluster . however , the dominant peak in the specific heat and the collapse of the overall prolate shape of the cluster do not occur until 1200  k. note that a small step in @xmath51 can also be observed near 1250  k , corresponding to this collapse . in this final , collapsed state , for temperatures of 1300  k and upwards , the ionic motion is diffusive and the cluster has a highly liquidlike character .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the canonical and microcanonical caloric curves are shown in fig .",
    "the canonical curve shows a mild kink extending across the temperature range 800 to 1400  k , corresponding to the peak in the canonical specific heat in fig .",
    "the microcanonical curve has a somewhat more distinct step around 1250  k , but the curve does not develop an s bend , as is theoretically possible in the microcanonical ensemble.@xcite no s bend was observed either for sn@xmath1 in our previous work using the same lda model.@xcite as is well known , s bends for the solidlike to liquidlike transition in clusters typically occur only for special sizes , such as the complete mackay icosahedra for the lennard - jones potential.@xcite corresponding to the absence of an s bend in the caloric curve , the microcanonical specific heat @xmath53 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , is everywhere finite and positive in the energy range studied .",
    "the curve @xmath53 shows the same basic features as the canonical curve @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but with higher resolution .",
    "in particular , the shoulder at 800  k and the main peak at 1200  k in @xmath54 become clearly resolved in @xmath53 as a small peak at an excitation energy @xmath55  ev per atom and a dominant peak at 0.36  ev per atom , respectively .",
    "this allows an extraction of the effective `` latent heat '' @xmath56 for the collapse of the prolate form , @xmath57  ev per atom , taken to be the area under the main peak in @xmath53 and above a line joining the points on the @xmath53 curve at @xmath58 and @xmath59  ev per atom .",
    "= 7.5 cm    interestingly , the collapse of the prolate form around 1250  k is accompanied by a rather drastic reduction in the homo - lumo gap . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show the thermal average ( taken over 7.5 ps ) of the homo - lumo gap as a function of temperature .",
    "the gap , which is fairly constant at about 0.036  a.u .  up to 1200  k , drops sharply by almost a factor of four around 1250  k , and continues to decrease as the temperature rises further . at first sight , it is tempting to interpret this reduction in the gap as related to the change in the nature of bonding from covalent to delocalized metallic .",
    "= 7.5 cm    to investigate this point in more detail , we have examined the eigenvalue spectrum of a typical prolate and nonprolate structure , along with an analysis of the number of nearest neighbors of these structures .",
    "although the nonprolate structure is more compact , the average number of nearest neighbors in both the prolate and nonprolate structures is almost the same .",
    "however , in the case of nonprolate structures , the bond angles are not optimal , resulting in strained bonds .",
    "these strained bonds can be considered to introduce disorder , which spreads out the energy levels by lifting degeneracies and splitting groupings of energy levels .",
    "this is evident from the kohn - sham eigenvalue spectrum [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ] of a prolate and nonprolate structure .",
    "although the total occupied bandwidth is almost the same , the eigenvalue spectrum of the prolate structure shows distinct bands , in contrast to the spread - out eigenvalue spectrum of the nonprolate structure , leading to the observed substantial reduction in the homo - lumo gap . to demonstrate that this reduction in the homo - lumo gap is due to the disorder in the system and not to a change in the nature of the bonding",
    ", we have also examined the elf of some randomly chosen high - temperature nonprolate structures .",
    "an isosurface of the elf for one of these structures is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] at a value @xmath60 .",
    "quite clearly , there is a significant localization of electron density between nearest neighbors , and the bonding is covalent .",
    "= 7.5 cm    finally , it is interesting to note that , although in sn@xmath0 the dominant peak in the specific heat occurs at a much higher temperature ( 1250  k ) than the bulk melting point ( 505  k ) , the peak for sn@xmath1 occurs at a still higher temperature ( 2300  k).@xcite to understand this , we note some features of the two clusters .",
    "sn@xmath1 contains one ttp unit , whereas sn@xmath0 contains two . although the nature of the bonding within each ttp unit is covalent , in sn@xmath0 the two ttp units are weakly bonded to each other . when ions acquire sufficient kinetic energy , they can cross from one ttp unit to the other , and the two ttp units in sn@xmath0 lose their separate identity .",
    "that is , the presence of another ttp unit provides an extra channel for ions to move . in sn@xmath1 , the main peak in the specific heat",
    "is associated with the breaking of covalent bonds within the ttp unit .    in future work",
    ", it will be interesting to investigate the transition from a prolate ground state to a nonprolate ground state as a function of cluster size .",
    "the present _ ab initio _ simulations on sn@xmath0 , along with earlier work on sn@xmath1,@xcite provide insights and an explanation of the higher - than - bulk `` melting point '' observed experimentally.@xcite there are two basic reasons for this behavior : ( i ) the covalent nature of the sn - sn bond in the cluster , compared to the metallic bonding of bulk sn at room temperature , and ( ii ) the special stability of the ttp unit .",
    "we also note that the `` melting '' of a cluster as detected in an ion mobility experiment is specifically associated with the collapse of the prolate cluster shape , which requires a collapse of the ttp units themselves .",
    "although many rearrangement processes can occur at lower temperatures , the dominant feature of the specific heat ( or caloric curve ) for both sn@xmath1 and sn@xmath0 is associated with the break up of the ttp structure . in the cluster containing one ttp unit , sn@xmath1 ,",
    "the ttp unit breaks up at the higher temperature , since the only processes that destroy the ttp unit are the ones that break the bonds . as the size increases ,",
    "for example sn@xmath0 , containing two ttp units , the collapse of the two ttp units leading to a compact cluster is aided by a relative motion between them , and occurs at a much lower temperature than the break up of the ttp unit for sn@xmath1 .    in a general way ,",
    "in a prolate cluster there will be a competition between the covalent bonding , which tends to favor stacks of ttp units , and the surface energy , which tends to favor more spherical structures .",
    "our calculations reveal that for sn@xmath0 the surface energy does not become the dominant factor until temperatures of about 1200  k. it is reasonable to expect that as the cluster size increases , the temperature for the collapse of the prolate structure will reduce further , until eventually the ground state structure itself is no longer prolate , as observed experimentally .",
