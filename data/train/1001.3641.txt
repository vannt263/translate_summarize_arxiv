    "in real - world signals data can be missing or unavailable to a very large extent , especially in archaeological , geological and physiological recordings which often once recorded in the past can not be generated again .",
    "knowing the effects which data loss may have on the correlations and other dynamical properties of the output signals of a given system is instrumental in accurately quantifying and modeling the underlying mechanisms driving the dynamics of the system .",
    "significant data loss can also be caused by failure of the data collection equipment , as well as by the removal of artifacts or noise - contaminated data segments . to correctly interpret results obtained from correlated signals with missing data , it is important to understand how the dynamical properties of such signals are affected by the degree of data loss .",
    "here we systematically investigate how loss of data changes the scaling properties of various long - range power - law anti - correlated and positively correlated signals .",
    "specifically , we develop a segmentation approach to generate surrogate signals by randomly removing data segments from stationary long - range power - law correlated signals , and we study how the correlation properties are affected by ( i ) the percentage of removed data , ( ii ) the average length of the removed ( or remaining ) data segments and ( iii ) the functional form of the probability distribution of the removed ( remaining ) segments .",
    "we utilize the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) to quantify the effect of extreme data loss on the scaling properties of long - range correlated signals .    scaling ( fractal ) behavior",
    "was first encountered in a class of physical systems  @xcite which for a given `` critical '' value of their parameters , exhibit complex organization among their individual components , leading to correlated interactions over a broad range of scales .",
    "this class of complex systems are typically characterized by ( i ) multi - component nonlinear feedback interactions , ( ii ) non - equilibrium output dynamics , and ( iii ) high susceptibility and responsiveness to perturbations . scaling",
    "behavior has been found in a diverse group of systems  ranging from earthquakes , to traffic jams and economic crashes , to neuronal excitations as well as the dynamics of integrated physiologic systems under neural control  and has been associated with the underlying mechanisms of regulation of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the output signals of such systems exhibit continuous fluctuations over multiple time and/or space scales  @xcite , where the amplitudes and temporal / spatial organization of the fluctuations are characterized by absence of dominant scale , i.e. , scale - invariant behavior . due to the nonlinear mechanisms controlling the underlying interactions , the output signals of these systems are also typically non - stationary , which masks the intrinsic correlations .",
    "traditional methods such as power - spectrum and auto - correlation analysis  @xcite are not suitable for nonstationary signals .",
    "dfa is a robust method suitable for detecting long - range power - law correlations embedded in nonstationary signals  @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to a variety of fields where scale - invariant behavior emerges , such as dna  , cardiac dynamics  , human locomotion  @xcite , circadian rhythm  @xcite , neural receptors in biological systems @xcite , seismology  @xcite , meteorology  @xcite , climate temperature fluctuations  , river flow and discharge @xcite , and economics  .",
    "the dfa method may also help identify different states of the same system exhibiting different scaling behavior  e.g. , the dfa scaling exponent @xmath0 for heart - beat intervals is significantly different for healthy and sick individuals  @xcite as well as for wake and sleep states  @xcite .",
    "elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms of a given system requires an accurate analysis and proper interpretation of the dynamical ( scaling ) properties of its output signals .",
    "it is often the case that the scaling exponent quantifying the temporal ( spatial ) organization of the systems dynamics across scales is not always the same , but depends on the scale of observation , leading to distinct crossovers  i.e. , the value of the scaling exponent may be different for smaller compared to larger scales .",
    "such behavior has been observed for diverse systems , for example : ( i ) the spontaneous motion of microbeads bound to the cytoskeleton of living cells as quantified by the mean - square displacement does not exhibit a brownian motion but instead undergoes a transition from subdiffusive to superdiffusive behavior with time  @xcite ; ( ii ) cardiac dynamics of healthy subjects during sleep are characterized by fluctuations in the heartbeat intervals exhibiting a crossover from a higher scaling exponent ( stronger correlations ) at small time scales ( from seconds up to a minute ) to a lower scaling exponent ( weaker correlations ) at large time scales ( from minutes to hours ) , associated with changes in neural autonomic control during sleep  @xcite ; and ( iii ) stock market dynamics where both absolute price returns and intertrade times exhibit a crossover from a lower scaling exponent at small time scales ( up to a trading day ) to much higher exponent at large time scales ( from a trading day to many months ) , a behavior consistent for all companies on the market  @xcite .",
    "however , crossovers may also be a result of various types of nonstationarities and artifacts present in the output signals , which , if not carefully investigated , may lead to incorrect interpretation and modeling of the underlying mechanisms regulating the dynamics of a given system  @xcite .    in previous studies , we have systematically investigated the effects of various types of nonstationarities , data pre - processing filters and data artifacts on the scaling behavior of long - range power - law correlated signals as measured by the dfa method  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we studied a type of nonstationarity which is caused by the presence of discontinuities ( gaps ) in the signal , i.e. , how randomly removing data segments of fixed length affects the scaling properties of long - range power - law correlated signals  @xcite .",
    "such discontinuities may arise from the nature of the recordings  e.g. , stock exchange data are not recorded during the nights , weekends and holidays . in these situations ,",
    "discontinuities correspond to segments of fixed size .",
    "alternatively , discontinuities may be caused by the fact that ( i ) part of the data is lost due to various reasons , and/or ( ii ) some noisy and unreliable portions of continuous recordings ( e.g. , measurement artifacts ) are discarded prior to analysis  . in these cases",
    ", the lengths of the lost or removed data segments are random , and may follow a certain type of distribution which can often be related to the process responsible for the removal or loss of data  e.g. , a data acquisition device which fails randomly with a given probability @xmath2 will result in a geometric distribution @xmath7 with mean @xmath8 , where @xmath5 is the length of the data lost segments .",
    "thus , investigating the effect of data loss is essential to determine the true correlation properties of the signal output of a given system .    to address this question ,",
    "we propose a new segmentation algorithm to generate surrogate signals by randomly removing data segments from long - range power - law correlated signals with a - priori known scaling properties , and we investigate the effects of the percentage of the removed data , different average lengths and different distributions of removed data segments .",
    "we compare the scaling behavior of the original signals with the scaling of the surrogate signals by systematically studying changes in the dfa scaling exponent .",
    "we utilize local scaling exponents to reveal subtle deviations and to characterize changes in the scaling behavior at different scales in signals with segment removed .",
    "we note , that in our investigation we consider the effect of data loss on signals where the scaling behavior remains constant for the duration of the observations .",

    "the value of the scaling exponent @xmath0 is related to the exponent @xmath27 characterizing the power spectrum @xmath28 of the signal , where @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "thus , the special case of @xmath30 noise , where @xmath31 , observed in various physiological and biological system dynamics , corresponding to @xmath32 .",

    "the choice of dfa-2 is dictated by the fact that this order of dfa-@xmath5 can accurately quantify the scaling behavior of signals with exponents in the range @xmath40  @xcite , which covers practically all signals generated by real world systems .",

    "this behavior is caused by the discontinuities in the surrogate signal at the transition points between remaining data segments , and since the remaining segments are of fixed length , the transition points occur periodically . if the segment length ( @xmath94 in fig .",
    "[ fig - aloc - seg - vary - t100-p90 ] ) is an integral multiple of the size of the fitting boxes ( scales ) in the dfa algorithm ( e.g. , @xmath117 ) , the transition points are not included in any fitting box and thus the rms fluctuation functions of the surrogate signals will be the same as in the original signals . in all other cases ,",
    "the discontinuities inside the fitting box will cause larger rms fluctuation functions and lead to jumps in the local scaling exponents at certain scales @xmath118 as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig - aloc - seg - vary - t100-p90 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - aloc3d - seg - vary - p10 ] , we show how the local scaling curves of positively correlated signals change with the average length @xmath6 of remaining segments , which follow an exponential distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - aloc3d - seg - vary - p10]a ) , a gaussian distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - aloc3d - seg - vary - p10]b ) , a @xmath72-distribution ( fig .",

    "the gaussian and @xmath72-distributions lead to a similar local scaling behavior with regions of pronounced overestimation and underestimation which are shifted to larger scales for increasing values of @xmath6 .",
    "this shift is also observed in the case of the exponential distribution , however , the deviation from the original scaling behavior ( overestimation / underestimation ) is less pronounced . in contrast , the power - law distribution shows less variation of the local scaling behavior and does not lead to such distinct regions of over- and underestimated @xmath88 values .",
    "in addition , the local scaling curves do not show a clear dependency ( `` shift '' ) with the average length of remaining segments @xmath6 .",

    "in this paper , we studied the effect of extreme data loss on the dfa scaling behavior of long - range power - law correlated signals . in order to simulate extreme data loss , often encountered in archaeological and geological data",
    ", we developed a new segmentation approach to generate correlated signals with randomly removed data segments . using this approach ,",
    "surrogate signals can be generated for different percentages of data loss , different average lengths and different distributions of removed / remaining data segments .",
    "we compared the difference between the dfa scaling behavior of original and surrogate signals by systematically changing the percentage of data loss and the average length of removed / remaining segments , and we also consider different functional forms of the distributions of removed / remaining segment lengths .",
    "we studied changes in the global scaling behavior as well as in the local scaling exponents to reveal subtle deviations across scales .",
    "we find that anti - correlated signals are very sensitive to data loss .",
    "even if only 10% of the data are removed , the scaling behavior of the surrogate signals changes dramatically , showing uncorrelated behavior at large scales .",
    "in contrast , positively correlated signals are more robust to data loss and no significant changes in the _ global _ scaling behavior are observed for up to 90% of data loss .",
    "however , in case of extreme data loss , we find significant and systematic deviations in the _ local _ scaling behavior which is overestimated at small scales and underestimated at large scales .",
    "specifically , we find that for anti - correlated signals the scale at which the local scaling exponent @xmath88 reaches 0.5 shifts to larger scales with increasing the average length @xmath102 ( or @xmath6 ) of the removed ( or remaining ) segments , following a power - law relationship with @xmath102 ( or @xmath6 ) . for positively correlated signals the regions of overestimation and underestimation of the local scaling exponent",
    "are also shifted to larger scales following a power - law with increasing @xmath102 ( or @xmath6 ) .",
    "as expected , increasing the percentage of data loss leads to more pronounced deviations in the local scaling behavior .",
    "however , the variation of local scaling curves follows different rules if the properties of either removed segments or remaining segments are considered . when the average length @xmath102 of _ removed _ data segments is kept constant , for increasing percentage @xmath99 of removed data , the deviations of both anti - correlated and positively correlated signals are shifted to smaller scales following a power - law with @xmath99 .",
    "when we focus on _ remaining _ data segments and keep their average length @xmath6 constant , the deviations become more pronounced with decreasing percentage @xmath116 of remaining data , however , the deviations occur at the same scales .    this behavior can be explained by the relationship between removed and remaining data . in case of a fixed percentage of removed or remaining data , @xmath102 and @xmath6 are always directly proportional to each other ( eq .  [ equ - mu ] ) and therefore the deviations ( and the shift of the most pronounced deviation ) show a similar power - law relation with @xmath102 and @xmath6 , while fixing the average length of removed or remaining segments leads to two different scenarios : ( i ) fixing @xmath102 and changing @xmath99 leads to changes in @xmath6 proportional to @xmath99 ; ( ii ) fixing @xmath6 and changing @xmath116 leads to changes in @xmath102 proportional to @xmath116 . since the scale of the most pronounced deviation from the original scaling behavior is shifted for scenario ( i ) where @xmath6 is changing and @xmath102 is fixed , but not scenario ( ii ) where @xmath102 is changing and @xmath6 is fixed , changes in @xmath102 do not contribute to the observed shift .",
    "thus , we suggest that @xmath6 is the key parameter to determine the scales at which the scaling behavior is mostly influenced , whereas the percentage of data loss determines the extent of this influence .",
    "different distributions of the lengths of removed / remaining segments affect the local scaling behavior differently . for gaussian and @xmath72-distributed segment lengths ,",
    "deviations are most pronounced and similar in extent , whereas power - law distributed segments show smallest deviations and a very different overall behavior when compare to exponential , gaussian and @xmath72-distributed segments .    in conclusion , our study shows that it is important to consider not only the percentage of data loss ( removed / remaining data ) , but also the average length of remaining segments to identify the scales at which deviations from the original ( `` real '' ) dfa scaling behavior is most pronounced .",
