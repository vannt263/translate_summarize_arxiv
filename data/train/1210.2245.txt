    "spherically symmetric ( uncharged ) perfect fluid bodies in equilibrium can not reach a black hole limit parametrically .",
    "buchdahl has shown@xcite that the schwarzschild coordinate radius of such a fluid ball is always greater than @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the gravitational mass . ] . correspondingly , the relative gravitational redshift @xmath2 of photons emitted from the fluid s surface and received at infinity is bounded by @xmath3 .    with rotation and/or electric charge",
    "a ( quasi ) black hole limit of regular equilibrium configurations is possible . in this parameter limit , if discussed from an external perspective , the spacetime of an extreme kerr - newman black hole outside the horizon forms . from an internal perspective , a still regular but non - asymptotically flat spacetime with the extreme kerr - newman near - horizon geometry at spatial infinity results .",
    "the first example was given with the extreme relativistic limit of a uniformly rotating disc of dust@xcite , for details see also refs .  .",
    "more examples can be found in refs .  .",
    "the simplest way to construct such `` quasiblack holes '' is to use the parametric compression of static configurations of `` electrically counterpoised dust ( ecd ) '' , also called `` bonnor stars''@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will touch on some general aspects of the black hole limit in the two special cases : ( i ) perfect fluid configurations ( angular momentum but no charge ) leading to extreme kerr black holes and ( ii ) ecd configurations ( electric charge but no angular momentum ) leading to extreme reissner - nordstrm black holes .",
    "we conclude with some comments on rotating discs of charged dust .",
    "this model provides a continuous connection between the two cases mentioned above .",
    "a black hole limit of a stationary and axisymmetric , uniformly rotating perfect fluid body occurs if and only if @xmath4 holds at the limit@xcite , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote angular velocity and angular momentum .",
    "consequently , from an external perspective , the spacetime of an extreme kerr black hole outside the horizon forms . a rigorous proof for the existence of such a limit was given with the analytic solution to the disc of dust problem@xcite .",
    "convincing numerical evidence for such a limit was also found for fluid ring solutions with various equations of state@xcite .",
    "the black hole limit of ecd configurations can be treated in quite a general manner , by applying a simple scaling transformation to any asymptotically flat papapetrou - majumdar solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , corresponding to a localized ecd distribution@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the `` outer world '' at the limit is always given by the spherically symmetric extreme reissner - nordstrm metric outside the horizon , the `` inner world '' does not need to show any spatial symmetry in general .",
    "the problem defining the global solution to the einstein - maxwell equations corresponding to a uniformly rotating ( infinitesimally thin ) disc of electrically charged dust with constant specific charge @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , we are using gauss units ) can be formulated as a boundary value problem for the ernst equations@xcite @xmath9 @xmath10 the boundary conditions on the disc ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) take a simple form in the corotating frame of reference ( indicated by primes ) : @xmath13 they have to be complemented by the asymptotic flatness conditions @xmath14 , @xmath15 as @xmath16 and a regularity condition at the rim of the disc . except from a scaling parameter ( @xmath17 or @xmath1 ) ,",
    "the solution can be discussed in terms of its dependence on the two parameters @xmath7 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "the limit @xmath20 leads back to the disc of dust solution discussed above . for @xmath21 ,",
    "one obtains a special ( non - rotating ) ecd configuration .",
    "the newtonian limit is characterized by @xmath22 , whereas @xmath23 is expected to lead to the black hole limit .",
    "the gravitational mass of the disc can , in general , be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denotes the baryonic mass .",
    "accordingly , the electric charge of the disc is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the factor @xmath28 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "is equal to the constant value of @xmath29 on the disc , cf .  the first boundary condition in .",
    "at the limit @xmath23 , we expect to obtain @xmath30 and thus @xmath31 on the disc . denoting this constant by @xmath32 ( @xmath33 )",
    ", the relation reduces to @xmath34 , which looks like the smarr formula@xcite for an extreme kerr - newman black hole . for finite @xmath1",
    ", the coordinate radius @xmath17 is expected to shrink to zero at the limit .",
    "indeed , the horizon of an extreme kerr - newman black hole is located at @xmath35 , @xmath11 in the coordinates used here .",
    "moreover , the kerr - newman solution satisfies the conditions @xmath30 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 on the horizon .",
    "a post - newtonian expansion of the disc of charged dust solution will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "it remains a challenge to find an explicit analytic solution as is possible for the uncharged case ( @xmath39 ) .",
