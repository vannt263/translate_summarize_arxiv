    "the recent announcement  @xcite by the atlas collaboration at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) of a diphoton excess around 750 gev has excited the high - energy phenomenology community in recent weeks . in a short note  @xcite ,",
    "i have pointed out that a gauge @xmath0 framework i established in 2002  @xcite has exactly all the necessary and sufficient particles and interactions for explaining this observation .",
    "there are actually many explicit realizations of this proposal .",
    "all contain the ingredients to accommodate the diphoton excess , but they differ in other essential aspects , such as neutrino mass , leptoquark , or diquark interactions , etc .",
    "this paper discusses each in turn .",
    "one specific version was already studied in 2010  @xcite .",
    ".particle content of gauge @xmath0 framework .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the particle content of this gauge @xmath1 extension of the supersymmetric standard model is fixed . whereas certain interactions are mandatory , others are not . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , different models come from choosing one of two classes of solutions : ( a ) or ( b ) . for each",
    ", there is also the ratio of two charges which may vary .",
    "hence there are many possible models within this framework .",
    "each will have all the mandatory interactions required to explain the 750 gev observation , but will have different predictions regarding other phenomena .",
    "consider the gauge group @xmath2 with the particle content of ref .",
    "@xcite as shown in table 1 .",
    "there are three copies of @xmath3 ; two copies of @xmath4 ; and one copy of @xmath5 .",
    "the following terms of the superpotential are always allowed : @xmath6 the charges @xmath7 and @xmath8 are arbitrary , except that @xmath9 is required to forbid the @xmath10 term of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .     by gluon fusion . ]",
    "hence @xmath11 always has the interactions which allow it to be produced by gluon fusion in one loop as shown in fig .  1 , and",
    "then decays in one loop to two photons as shown in fig .  2 .     to two photons",
    "]    it may also decay into @xmath12 final states directly and increase its total width .",
    "these are then the essential ingredients which could explain the 750 gev observation .    in choosing @xmath7 and @xmath8 , if the resulting model has only those interactions of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , then the @xmath13 particles are stable .",
    "they may form bound states with the known quarks and become exotic stable matter . in the following , only cases with additional interactions",
    "are considered .",
    "in ( a ) for @xmath14 , the following interactions become allowed : @xmath15 this is the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in ref .",
    "@xcite for illustration .",
    "now @xmath16 should be considered as leptoquark superfields , which may also be relevant  @xcite in understanding other possible lhc flavor anomalies . for @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 acquires a large majorana mass , hence @xmath19 gets a small majorana seesaw mass in the usual way .    in ( b ) for @xmath20 ,",
    "the following interactions become allowed : @xmath21 now @xmath22 is a leptoquark , but @xmath23 is stable because the @xmath24 term is not possible as an @xmath25 singlet .",
    "neutrino masses are forced to be dirac .    in (",
    "b ) for @xmath26 , the only allowed new interaction is @xmath27 hence @xmath23 is a leptoquark , but @xmath28 is a stable heavy quark .",
    "neutrino masses must again be dirac .",
    "in ( a ) for @xmath20 , the following interactions become allowed : @xmath29 now both @xmath16 are diquarks , and neutrinos obtain seesaw dirac masses as follows . in the space spanned by @xmath30 , the @xmath31",
    "neutrino mass matrix is of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 comes from @xmath34 , @xmath35 from @xmath36 , and @xmath37 from @xmath38 .",
    "this is thus a dirac seesaw with @xmath39 .    in ( b ) for @xmath14 ,",
    "the following interactions become allowed : @xmath40 now @xmath22 is a diquark , but @xmath23 is stable because the @xmath41 term is not possible as an @xmath25 singlet .",
    "further , @xmath18 and @xmath42 transform in the same way under @xmath1 , so that a linear combination pairs up with @xmath19 to form dirac neutrinos .    in ( b ) for @xmath43 ,",
    "the only allowed new interaction is @xmath44 hence @xmath23 is a diquark , but @xmath28 is a stable heavy quark .",
    "neutrino masses must again be dirac .",
    "the @xmath16 singlets may transform in the same way as @xmath45 under @xmath1 . in that case , they will mix and the heavy ones will decay to the lighter ones .",
    "another possibility is that @xmath46 or @xmath47 is an allowed mass term under @xmath1 , in which case there is again mixing .    in ( a ) for @xmath48 , @xmath16 and @xmath45",
    "transform in the same way under @xmath1 . in ( b ) for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 transform in the same way , but @xmath28 remains stable . in ( b ) for @xmath52 , @xmath22 and @xmath53 transform in the same way ,",
    "but @xmath23 remains stable . in ( b ) for @xmath54 , @xmath47 is a mass term , but @xmath23 is also stable . in all cases ,",
    "neutrino masses are dirac .    in ( a ) for @xmath55 and in ( b ) for @xmath56",
    ", the @xmath57 term is allowed .",
    "this means that only one of the exotic @xmath13 states is stable .",
    "to allow majorana neutrino masses , the term @xmath58 should be present . for @xmath59 , it implies @xmath14 in ( a ) and @xmath60 in ( b ) . for @xmath61 which automatically allows @xmath62",
    ", it implies @xmath60 in ( a ) and @xmath63 in ( b ) . for @xmath64 , it implies @xmath65 in ( a ) and @xmath66 in ( b ) . in all cases except the first , i.e. @xmath14 in ( a ) which leads to eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the exotic @xmath13 quarks are stable and there is no other interaction involving them .    the @xmath67 term by itself is allowed if @xmath68 in ( a ) or @xmath69 in ( b ) .",
    "there is however no other allowed term beyond eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the exotic @xmath13 quarks are stable in these cases .",
    "the two most plausible models are those described by eqs .  ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the former  @xcite has @xmath16 as leptoquarks , and neutrino masses are majorana from a tev scale seesaw mechanism .",
    "the latter has @xmath16 as diquarks , and neutrino masses are dirac from a high scale seesaw mechanism . in most other models ,",
    "either @xmath23 or @xmath28 or both are stable .",
    "neutrino masses are dirac in most cases with no understanding of why they are so small .",
    "since the @xmath1 charge assignments of quarks and leptons are all different in these various models , the key is in the observation of the associated @xmath70 gauge boson .",
    "if the lhc finds a @xmath71 gauge boson , its decay branching fractions  @xcite would help distinguish among possible models of this gauge @xmath0 framework .",
