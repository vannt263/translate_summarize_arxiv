    "in close binary systems , the most extreme examples of tidal distortion are found observationally among contact binary stars , the most common variety being the w  ursae majoris ( w  uma ) variables .",
    "the apparent brightnesses of these systems are continuously variable , even out of eclipse , a property which signals the breakdown of symmetry of the component stars about their respective rotational axes .",
    "as illustrated in figure  1 by the eponymous variable w  uma itself , w  uma variables are characterized as well by having primary and secondary eclipses of nearly equal depths .",
    "in addition , they show very little color variation through eclipse . since the ratio of eclipse depths is dictated by the ratio of surface brightnesses of the component stars , the near equality of eclipse depths and absence of pronounced color variation in either eclipse demand that the component stars are nearly identical in effective temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "detailed light curve synthesis models , employing roche potentials for the equilibrium surfaces of the two stars , show that the component stars in w  uma binaries exist in a state of physical contact .    in orbital period ,",
    "the w  uma binaries are overwhelmingly concentrated at short orbital period , down to @xmath1 ( cc com ) , with few systems at periods @xmath2 . because both stars fill their roche lobes , the orbital periods of w  uma systems are closely coupled to the stellar mean densities , with @xmath3 . the orbital period range occupied by w  uma systems",
    "then immediately tells us that they reside on or near the main sequence , with primary masses roughly in the range 0.6 to 2 m@xmath4 .",
    "that inference is reinforced by a strong correlation between orbital period and dereddened color ( eggen 1967 ) .",
    "these are therefore systems in which the primary components are still in core hydrogen burning .",
    "the fact that w  uma systems are found in clusters along their main sequences , often below the cluster turn - off ( _ e.g. _ , rucinski 1998 ) , confirms this conclusion , and implies that the secondary components as well are in core hydrogen burning .",
    "spectroscopic studies of w  uma systems reveal that , despite the facts that these binaries reside along the main sequence and that their component effective temperatures a nearly equal , they invariably have unequal masses , in some cases spectacularly so .",
    "the roche geometry requires that the ratio of radii of contact components vary as @xmath5 ( kuiper 1941 ) , whereas the ratio of radii of single low - mass zero - age main sequence stars depends more strongly on mass , @xmath6 .",
    "the near - equality of effective temperatures in w  uma binaries therefore demands that the ratio of radiated luminosities vary as @xmath7 , whereas the ratio of nuclear luminosities for two zero - age main sequence stars of the same respective masses varies roughly as @xmath8 at the low masses appropriate to these binaries . among well - studied w  uma systems",
    ", one finds within observational uncertainties that @xmath9 ( _ e.g. _ , mochnacki 1981 ) , so it is evident that the secondary ( less massive ) component is drawing much of its radiant luminosity from the core of the primary ( more massive ) component .",
    "this energy transfer amounts to a relatively modest reduction in the luminosity of the primary , but clearly initiates a major restructuring of the secondary , which becomes oversized and overluminous for its mass . delineating the mechanism which effects energy transfer , and accounting for its stability ( or lack thereof ) , are the core problems in understanding the structure and evolution of w  uma systems .",
    "w  uma binaries come in two flavors , a - type and w - type .",
    "observationally , they are distinguished by whether the primary ( deeper ) eclipse corresponds to transit of the ( less massive ) secondary across the face of the primary ( a - type ) , or to occultation of the secondary by the primary ( w - type ) .",
    "there is a fairly clean separation of the subtypes by spectral type : a - type w  uma systems have a - f spectra , and w - type systems have g - k spectra .",
    "the difference between primary and secondary eclipse depths is quite small ( amounting to no more than a few hundredths of a magnitude ) , but reflects a small difference in the eclipsed surface brightnesses of the two components . in the a - type systems",
    ", this difference can be laid to the effects of gravity - darkening in an otherwise homogeneous common envelope ( the transiting secondary having a slightly lower mean gravity , and hence lower surface brightness ) . in the w - type systems , a small but real difference in mean surface brightnesses between components is indicated , with the secondary s surface actually slightly brighter than the primary s .",
    "formally , this difference reflects a difference in effective temperatures ( in the sense that effective temperature is defined in terms of bolometric surface brightness ) , but that interpretation is somewhat misleading , in that eclipse depths in the w - type systems remain nearly constant with wavelength through the near ultraviolet ( _ e.g. _ , eaton , wu and rucinski 1980 ) , implying that the _ color _ temperatures of the two stars are nearly identical",
    ". preferential starspot formation on the primary components of w - type systems ( figure  2 ) may provide an explanation for the lack of wavelength dependence in relative eclipse depths ( rucinski 1985 , 1993 ) , if not the underlying difference in effective temperatures .    since the first serious attempt to estimate the space density of w  uma binaries ( shapley 1948 ) , it has been evident that these are extremely common objects . in gravitational microlensing surveys of the galactic bulge ,",
    "foreground w  uma variables are easily the most common periodic variables detected .",
    "( they are too faint , intrinsically , to be picked up in great numbers in the magellanic clouds . ) rucinski ( 1998 ) estimated from the ogle  i results that they account for roughly 1/130 of solar - type stars in the foreground disk projected against the galactic bulge .",
    "if we take this relative frequency at face value , it implies that the lifetime of the w  uma state must exceed @xmath10 yr .",
    "indeed , the paucity of near - contact _ detached _ low - mass binaries to replenish the w  uma population implies that this is a very weak lower limit to their lifetimes .",
    "we shall have more to say on the significance of semi - detached and detached analogues of w  uma systems below . for the present , we note that the high abundance of w  uma systems requires that they survive for many times the thermal time scales of their primary components .",
    "in a uniformly - rotating binary star , the acceleration of a test particle can be derived from an effective potential @xmath11 ( the roche potential in the limit that each binary component can be approximated by a point mass at its center ) .",
    "the condition of complete hydrostatic equilibrium then requires that @xmath12 since the gradient in pressure @xmath13 coincides in direction with the gradient in potential @xmath11 , it follows that pressure must be a function of @xmath11 alone , @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , the density @xmath15 must also be a function of @xmath11 alone : @xmath16",
    "assuming a homogeneous composition on equipotential surfaces , it then follows that _ all _ state variables are constant on equipotential surfaces , _",
    "i.e. _ , functions of @xmath11 alone ( von zeipel 1924 ) .",
    "the near - uniformity of local effective temperature over the surface of a w  uma binary can then be understood as a consequence of hydrostatic equilibrium obtaining throughout its common envelope ( osaki 1965 ; lucy 1968 ) .",
    "energy exchange between contact components is thus implicitly demanded by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the question remains whether a contact state of hydrostatic equilibrium can be achieved in a state of thermal equilibrium as well .",
    "the observational fact that w  uma binaries inhabit later spectral types implies that they have convective envelopes .",
    "efforts to build structural models have therefore generally assumed that the respective component envelopes can be characterized by a common specific entropy deep into their envelopes .",
    "these models take advantage of the fact that stellar convection in low - mass main sequence stars is so efficient that removing half the luminosity carried by convection ( or increasing it ten - fold ) makes scarcely any difference to the run of temperature with pressure through the envelope , unless transfer occurs in the superadiabatic part of the convection zone . in his pioneering study , lucy ( 1968 )",
    "first applied this assumption to build models of contact binaries in thermal equilibrium .",
    "lucy s solution technique is illustrated graphically in figure  3 .",
    "he constructed model stellar sequences in which a common adiabatic constant ( @xmath17 ) characterizing the surface convection zone in both stars , @xmath18 , and total blackbody luminosity , @xmath19 , were substituted as surface boundary conditions for application of the blackbody law separately to each component .",
    "thermal equilibrium contact solutions occur where , for contact components sharing a common value of @xmath20 , the ratio of stellar radii satisfies the contact condition , and the total radiated luminosity equals the sum of the respective nuclear luminosities . for a given primary mass , solutions of this type are possible only if one treats the mass of the secondary ( or , equivalently , the total orbital angular momentum ) as an eigenvalue of the problem .",
    "lucy succeeded in finding thermal equilibrium solutions for zero - age contact binaries with unequal components , but only in circumstances where the primary component was massive enough to burn hydrogen in the cn - cycle , while the less massive secondary subsisted on the @xmath21-chain .",
    "that transition between hydrogen - burning networks coincides with the change in slope of @xmath22 at fixed @xmath20 seen in figure  3 .    in reality , most w  uma systems are cool and dense enough that both components must burn hydrogen on the @xmath21-chain .",
    "lucy s thermal equilibrium models were therefore able to account only for systems of the highest mass , with the bluest colors , and could not be pushed to lower masses and later spectral types without appealing to unphysically high cn - cycle reaction rates or extremely metal - rich compositions ( moss & whelan 1970 ) .",
    "allowance for evolved primary components permits a modest expansion in the span of solutions ( hazlehurst 1970 ) , but it can not account for the numerous relatively red systems found well below turnoff in old clusters ( @xmath23 rucinski 1998 ) . relaxing the equal - entropy condition for the component envelopes permits one to build thermal equilibrium models throughout the observed period - color plane ( biermann & thomas 1972 , 1973 ) , but these models no longer satisfy the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium in the common envelope , and predict effective temperature differences between components far exceeding those allowed by the observed small differences between primary and secondary eclipse depths .",
    "as discussed by many authors ( see the review by smith 1984 for a particularly lucid account ) , the problem of building thermal equilibrium models of w  uma binaries is over - constrained . in a detached binary",
    ", one can choose the masses and compositions of the stars independently ; interaction terms are small , and the structure solutions differ little from those of isolated stars . in a contact binary , however , hydrostatic equilibrium imposes two additional constraints : the radii of the two stars must conform to a common equipotential , and furthermore ( appealing to the more tractable convective envelope case ) their envelope entropies must be equal . for a given total mass and total angular momentum , the binary mass ratio and the depth of contact must be eigenvalues of the problem , and solutions are possible only for a very small range of parameters .",
    "if conditions for thermal equilibrium and hydrostatic equilibrium can not be satisfied simultaneously , then given the enormous difference in their characteristic global time scales ( roughly a factor of @xmath24 in w  uma binaries ) , it is logical to abandon the requirement for thermal equilibrium .",
    "lucy ( 1976 ) and flannery ( 1976 ) showed that models of late - type contact binaries with isentropic common envelopes could then be constructed , but that such systems suffer cyclic thermal relaxation oscillations ( tro s  see also khler , matraka , & weigert 1986@xmath25 , 1987 ) . in this cycle",
    ", the system oscillates between contact and semi - detached states . in the contact state ,",
    "energy transfer from primary to secondary inflates the secondary ( driving mass transfer from secondary to primary ) . in the semi - detached state",
    ", the primary continues to fill its roche lobe , but the secondary initially relaxes from its energy - transfer - inflated state toward thermal equilibrium , only to be driven by continuing mass transfer back into a contact state . as illustrated in figure  4 , this cycle is driven by the fact that the contact condition demands of the secondary a radius intermediate between two thermal equilibrium states : one contact ( with an isentropic common envelope ) and one detached ( with no mass or energy input from the primary ) .    in the contact phase , tro models successfully reproduce late - type w  uma - like systems even with unevolved components ( where thermal equilibrium models fail ) .",
    "however , in the semi - detached phase ( which spans a duration and color range comparable with the contact phase , with the same range of orbital periods ) , the primary and secondary develop very different effective temperatures .",
    "the tro model therefore predicts a population of eclipsing binaries with decidedly unequal minima ( @xmath26 lyrae- , or eb - type binaries ) overlapping in period and color , and similar in number , with the w  uma systems .",
    "examples exist of such short - period eb systems ( lucy & wilson 1979 ) , but they appear to be relatively rare , a conclusion emphatically supported by the fact rucinski ( 1998 ) found only @xmath27 ( by space density ) of erstwhile contact binaries with @xmath28 in the ogle survey of baade s window displayed poor thermal contact .",
    "other investigations of tro models ( robertson & eggleton 1977 ; rahunen 1981 , 1982 , 1983 ) find that the amplitude of relaxation oscillations can be damped by systemic angular momentum losses , but the discrepancy in component temperatures remains a problem during the semi - detached phase of the oscillations .",
    "oscillations might in principle be suppressed completely for sufficiently rapid systemic angular momentum loss , but the lifetimes of w  uma binaries then become so short as to make it impossible to account for their relatively high space density .",
    "the difficulties which structural models of w  uma binaries encounter clearly require a physical model of mass and energy exchange  one which can be implemented in an evolutionary code  if they are to be resolved . over the years",
    ", there have been a number of attempts to build such a model from hydrodynamical considerations ( hazlehurst & meyer - hofmeister 1973 ; moses 1976 ; nariai 1976 ; webbink 1977 ; robertson 1980 ; smith & smith 1981 ; hazlehurst 1985 ; khler 1989 ; tassoul 1992 ; martin & davey 1995 ; hazlehurst 1999 ) .",
    "motivated by the success which lucy s original hypothesis ( a homogeneous , hydrostatic envelope filling a common equipotential surface ) enjoyed in reproducing the light curves of w  uma variables , these interaction models have , with a few exceptions , appealed to a large - scale circulation between components , driven by small departures from a completely static , barotropic common envelope . since mean vertical temperature gradients",
    " those perpendicular to equipotential surfaces  vastly exceed mean horizontal temperature gradients , it is clear that advection , not radiative transport , must be the agent of energy exchange . in strict hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "no lateral energy transfer occurs at all .",
    "while it is commonly assumed that the advective flows are only mildly dynamical , this is by no means assured .",
    "most light curve solutions for w  uma systems yield a very shallow degree of contact , typically of order @xmath29 , with the a - type systems tending toward slightly deeper geometric contact than the w - type systems ( _ e.g. _ , mochnacki 1981 ) .",
    "webbink ( 1977 ) found , from a comparison with envelope models for mail sequence stars in the same mass range , that the observed depths of contact only slightly exceed the minimum needed to carry the exchange luminosity at sonic velocity in a closed circulation through the `` neck '' in the roche potentials connecting the two stars at the inner lagrangian ( @xmath30 ) point ( see his fig .",
    "this estimate is based on the assumption that radiative and/or convective relaxation across the flow near @xmath30 is efficient , and that energy exchange is effected by the vertical ascent or descent of the closed circulation through the vertical entropy gradient in the common envelope .",
    "comparison of ( i ) binary orbital period , ( ii ) sound travel time between components at the base of the common envelope , and ( iii ) local convective turnover time scale or radiative relaxation time scale ( as appropriate ) shows that all three of these time scales are comparable in both w - type and a - type w  uma binaries ( see figs . 2 and 3 in webbink 1977 ) .",
    "coriolis effects and energy transport perpendicular to the flow further complicate efforts to build a conceptual model of energy exchange .",
    "the efforts described above to model contact binary stars have concentrated almost exclusively on the observationally abundant classical w  uma - type binaries .",
    "however , binary evolutionary calculations ( benson 1970 ; yungelson 1973 ; webbink 1976@xmath31 ; flannery & ulrich 1977 ; kippenhahn & meyer - hofmeister 1977  see especially nelson & eggleton 2001 ) show unambiguously that the contact state arises in a far wider range of circumstances than w  uma systems reflect , and under conditions ( namely , contact between two stars with radiative envelopes ) which can not be modeled by the usual expedient of removing luminosity from the primary s surface convection zone and injecting it into the secondary s .",
    "massive contact binaries are by no means unknown ( see , _ e.g. _ , hilditch & bell 1987 ) , but they present a significantly greater observational challenge than late - type systems in the quest for reliable spectroscopic orbits and light curve solutions , and so have not received the same level of attention as w  uma systems . nevertheless , eggleton ( 1996 ) has suggested that they may in fact be even more common than w  uma binaries , in terms of frequency relative to all stars of the same spectral class .",
    "structurally , contact binaries with radiative envelopes must still abide by the precepts laid out above in  2 if they are to achieve complete hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "however , the large vertical entropy gradient in a radiatively stable envelope , large luminosity to be transferred between components to equilibrate the common envelope , and relatively small heat capacity of the common envelope ( relative to transferred luminosities ) all augur for more vigorously dynamical interaction between components than typifies their convective counterparts . among the w",
    "uma binaries , the difficulty or impossibility of achieving thermal equilibrium limits them to small depths of contact , as argued above ; over nuclear time scales , the evolutionary expansion of the more massive component can then only be accommodated by expansion of the binary . that expansion requires mass transfer from less - massive to more - massive component .",
    "the limited angular momentum available is gradually subsumed in rotation of the primary star , and the binary coalesces ( webbink 1976@xmath32 ; rasio 1995 ) . in massive contact binaries ,",
    "the much greater inefficiency of energy exchange between components opens the possibility that they might , for example , succeed in passing through deep contact and reverse their initial mass ratios , as do classical algol binaries , or otherwise suffer some very different fate from their low - mass cousins .",
    "the lack of physically plausible models for energy and mass exchange in radiative contact binaries is a major obstacle in understanding massive binary evolution .",
    "the essential difficulty in modeling energy exchange in contact binaries is that some departure from strict hydrostatic equilibrium is necessary to effect energy transfer .",
    "but the nature of said departure , and the advective flows resulting from it , depend sensitively on the thermal state of the respective stellar envelopes . in turn , the thermal state of those envelopes",
    "is profoundly affected by energy transfer .",
    "these are not separable issues , and one needs to be able to model mean dynamical flows , interacting with the ambient radiation field , as they evolve on the much longer global thermal time scales of the stellar components .",
    "friends and colleagues too numerous to name have helped shape the opinions expressed here , but i wish to thank in particular peter eggleton and the late john whelan for many insightful discussions of contact binary structure , and paul hendry and stefan mochnacki for permission to reprint one of their stunning doppler images of vw cep ( figure  2 ) .",
