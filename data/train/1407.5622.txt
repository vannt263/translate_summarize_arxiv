    "the mechanism of core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) remains an open problem despite over half a century of theoretical effort .",
    "in particular , theory can not reliably predict which stars that undergo core collapse become ccsne or which form black holes instead of neutron stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "observationally , comparisons of massive star formation and sne rates ( @xcite , @xcite ) , limits on the diffuse sn neutrino background ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the galactic rate ( @xcite ) , and direct searches for failed sne ( @xcite , @xcite ) limit the fraction of failed ccsne to @xmath17 of core collapses . there does , however , appear to be a deficit of higher mass ccsn progenitors ( @xcite ) , which is best quantified by the absence of red supergiant progenitors above @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a natural explanation of this deficit is that @xmath19 to @xmath20 of core collapses fail to produce a ccsne and instead form a black hole without a dramatic external explosion .",
    "further progress in completing the mapping between progenitors and outcomes both for successful ccsne and in searches for failed ccsne should clarify these issues over the next decade .",
    "we have few other probes of the ccsn mechanism other than this mapping between progenitors and external outcomes , although even this does not constrain the balance between neutron star and black hole formation in successful ccsne .",
    "neutrinos or gravity waves would be the best probe of the physics of core collapse , but this will only be possible for a galactic supernova where the rates are low ( once every @xmath21  years , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the stellar mass function favors having a relatively low mass progenitor for which the neutrino mechanism for ccsne works reasonably well and we have high confidence that the outcome is a neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) rather than a rarer , higher mass progenitor where the explosion mechanism and the type of remnant remains problematic .",
    "even if the rate of failed ccsne is @xmath22 to @xmath20 , the probability of detecting the formation of a black hole in the galaxy is very low .",
    "another direct probe of the sn mechanism is the mass function of the remnant neutron stars and black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most neutron star masses are clustered around @xmath23 , black hole masses are clustered around @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and there is a gap ( or at least a deep minimum ) between the masses of neutron stars and black holes . interpreting these results is challenging because these masses can only be measured in binaries and the selection functions for finding neutron star and black hole binaries are both different and difficult or impossible to model from first principles .",
    "if , however , we assume that the separate mass distributions of neutron stars and black holes are relatively unbiased , then we can use them to constrain the physics of core collapse .",
    "for example , in @xcite , we showed that the masses of double neutron star binaries strongly favored explosion models with no mass falling back onto the proto - neutron star and that the explosion probably develops at the edge of the iron core near a specific entropy of @xmath26 .",
    "fall - back is traditionally invoked in order to explain how the observed masses of black holes can be less than the typical masses of their progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , in @xcite , we pointed out that failed ccsne of red supergiants naturally produce black holes with the observed masses because the hydrogen envelope is ejected to leave a remnant that has the mass of the helium core ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite noted that stellar mass loss processes leads to stars ( e.g. , wolf - rayet stars ) that will produce black holes with masses comparable to that of the helium core .",
    "based on these concepts , @xcite associated the black hole mass with the helium core mass and then estimated the probability of black hole formation as a function of progenitor mass needed to explain the observed black hole mass function .",
    "as expected from the arguments in @xcite , this required a peak in the probability distribution at initial ( zams ) masses of @xmath27-@xmath16 while also allowing a second peak at @xmath28 because mass loss leads the @xcite progenitor models to produce the same helium core mass for two different initial masses .",
    "however , while stellar mass largely determines the fate of a star , it is not directly related to the physics of core collapse .",
    "a more physical approach would be to relate the formation of a black hole to some property of the stellar core at the onset of collapse that is related to the likelihood of a successful explosion .",
    "this should not only lead to a more realistic model of the remnant mass distribution , but the parameter range needed to explain the mass function can then be used to inform models of core collapse .",
    "@xcite argued that the compactness of the core defined by @xmath29 is a good metric for the `` explodability '' of a star .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 , the compactness at a baryonic mass of @xmath30 , is a measure of how rapidly the density is dropping outside the iron core .",
    "if @xmath0 is small , the density is dropping rapidly and it is easier for neutrino heating or other physical effects to revive the shock and produce a successful explosion .",
    "the reverse holds if the compactness is high .",
    "@xcite argued for a lower compactness threshold than @xcite , and also considered the correlation of other properties of the core with the production of a successful explosion , finding relatively strong correlations with the binding energy of the material outside the iron core and little correlation with the mass of the iron core or the mass inside the oxygen burning shell .",
    "the compactness is not a simple function of progenitor mass , and @xcite find that complex interactions between ( in particular ) carbon and oxygen burning shells can drive rapid variations in compactness with stellar mass .    in this paper ,",
    "following the approach of @xcite for neutron stars , we model the observed black hole mass function to determine what explosion criteria will explain the black hole mass function under the assumption that the black hole mass equals the helium core mass at the time of explosion . while partly inspired by @xcite , our approach ties the model to the physics underlying the success of an explosion rather than the initial stellar mass . unlike @xcite , we will also directly fit the data on black hole masses from @xcite rather than fitting their parametrized model of the black hole mass function .",
    "this is of some importance because the compactness is a complex function of initial mass , leading to a mass function with non - trivial structure . in ",
    "2 we summarize our statistical model , in  3 we present our results , and in  4 we discuss the future of this approach .",
    "there are three elements to our calculation .",
    "first , we must estimate the probability @xmath31 of the data @xmath32 for black hole candidate system @xmath33 given an estimated black hole mass @xmath34 .",
    "second , we must estimate the probability @xmath35 of finding a black hole of mass @xmath34 given a set of model parameters @xmath36 describing the outcomes of core collapse for a set of models @xmath37 .",
    "third , we must have some set of priors @xmath38 on the model parameters .",
    "combining these terms using bayes theorem , the probability distribution for our model parameters given the data on black holes is @xmath39 if we only want to consider the probability distribution for the parameters of a particular model @xmath37 , we simply normalize this distribution to unity",
    ". we can also compare different stellar models or criteria for black hole formation , where the probability of model @xmath37 compared to all other models is @xmath40^{-1 }       \\label{eqn : relprob}\\ ] ] for models with the same numbers of parameters .",
    "this is basically the procedure that has been used extensively to estimate the intrinsic black hole mass distribution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) but modified as done in @xcite to relate the data to an underlying model of core collapse rather than to a parametrized model of the remnant mass distribution .    for modeling the data",
    ", we simply follow the procedures and data summaries from @xcite with one exception .",
    "the probability @xmath31 depends on the data available for each system .",
    "if both the mass ratio and inclination of a system are constrained , the probability distribution is described as a gaussian @xmath41       \\label{data : case1}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the estimated mass and its uncertainty and the term is always normalized such that @xmath44 .",
    "if the measured mass function is @xmath45 with uncertainty @xmath46 and the mass ratio @xmath47 is restricted to the range @xmath48 then @xmath49 \\over 1-x_m }        \\label{data : case2}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , the inclination distribution is assumed to be uniform in @xmath51 over @xmath52 , and the minimum inclination @xmath53 is set by the requirement for having no eclipses . finally ,",
    "if there is also a constraint on the inclination , we include a multiplicative probability for the inclination , @xmath54 .",
    "we could reproduce the results in @xcite if we also truncated the distributions at @xmath55 .",
    "we model the probability of observing a black hole of mass @xmath34 as @xmath56 which is also normalized to unity , @xmath57 .",
    "the first term is a salpeter progenitor mass function , @xmath58 .",
    "the stellar models define a mapping @xmath59 between the initial mass and the helium core mass we use for the mass of the black hole .",
    "the second term comes from the variable transformation from @xmath60 in the progenitor mass function to @xmath34 in the black hole mass function .",
    "the effects of mass loss on higher mass stars means that the same black hole mass can result for two different progenitor masses , and we must sum over all solutions @xmath33 .",
    "the third term is the probability that a progenitor with some physical property @xmath61 will form a black hole .",
    "this is a one - dimensional sequence of a variable like the compactness and we assume a simple model where @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65 and that @xmath66 increases linearly over @xmath67 .",
    "it is also useful to constrain @xmath68 , the value at which 50% of core collapses produce black holes .",
    "we might expect a sharp transition with @xmath69 at which stars either form black holes or not .",
    "however , there are many secondary variables ( e.g. , rotation , composition , binary mass transfer ) that affect stellar evolution beyond mass , and stars of a given initial mass likely end with a distribution of compactnesses ( or any other collapse criterion ) at death .",
    "it is reasonable to assume this distribution is largely a spread in final compactnesses around the values for a particular sequence of progenitor models with mass , with the net effect of producing a smoothed @xmath66 even if the true transition is sharp .",
    "@xcite proposed using a mass - dependent probability of black hole formation for similar physical reasons .    the final term , @xmath70 , models the completeness of the observed black hole mass function . because @xmath71 is normalized to unit total probability ( or , equivalently , that we have no constraint on the absolute number of black holes ) , only the shape and not the normalization of @xmath72 affects the results .",
    "if @xmath73 we are more likely to find high mass black holes , and the reverse if @xmath74 .",
    "completeness and biases have always been a significant concern for interpreting the black hole mass function , particularly because black hole masses are only measured in interacting binaries ( see , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "whatever biases exist , they are probably a relatively smooth function of mass and including @xmath72 allows us to test for their effects or to simply marginalize over @xmath75 as a nuisance parameter .",
    "our model parameters , such as the compactness limits or the exponent of the completeness function , all have limited dynamic ranges making uniform priors a reasonable choice . for comparisons between models with different parameters ( equation  [ eqn : relprob ] ) , we normalize the priors as @xmath76 over the range used for the calculation",
    ". this will give different models equal relative probabilities in equation  [ eqn : relprob ] unless the data significantly discriminates between the models .",
    "we also compute the fraction @xmath77 of core collapses leading to black holes under the assumption that all stars with @xmath78 undergo core collapse .",
    "we include a weak prior @xmath79 on the models using the constraints derived by @xcite from combining the observed galactic sn rate with the lack of any neutrino detection of a galactic black hole formation event . a stiffer limit of @xmath80 could probably be justified based on comparisons of sn and star formation rates ( @xcite ) or limits on the diffuse neutrino background ( @xcite ) , but these introduce a dependence on estimates of star formation rates and are difficult to translate into a mathematical prior .",
    "these estimates of @xmath77 are contingent on the normalization that @xmath81 becomes unity for @xmath82 .",
    "we could allow @xmath83 for @xmath82 without any consequences for our models of the black hole mass function , and this would reduce @xmath77 .",
    "while there are differences in the details of the analyses by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the primary differences in the results are driven by differences in the samples of black hole candidates . @xcite and",
    "@xcite analyze a sample of 16 systems with low mass companions , while @xcite analyze 15 low mass systems , where gc  339@xmath844 is the system that is not in common . for these low mass systems , the resulting inferences about the black hole mass functions",
    "are mutually consistent .",
    "@xcite also carries out the analysis including 5 systems with high mass companions .",
    "these systems generally have probability distributions requiring significantly higher masses than the low mass sample , and the inferred black hole mass functions have significantly more probability for @xmath85 with their inclusion .    like the question of differences in selection functions for neutron stars and black holes , the relative selection functions for black hole systems with high and low mass companions probably can not be derived",
    ". however , the sharply declining mass functions found from using only the low mass systems are hard to reconcile with the existence of the high mass systems . for example , for an exponential mass function , @xmath86 with @xmath87 fit to the low mass samples , @xcite finds @xmath88 and @xmath89 while @xcite finds @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "these low mass samples exclude the high mass system cyg  x1 , which has an improved mass estimate of @xmath92 by @xcite ( although @xcite argues the uncertainties are somewhat larger ) . given the sample sizes , the probability of finding a system as massive as cyg  x1 based on these mass functions is only about 5% .",
    "clearly , adding the information that these generally higher black hole mass , high companion mass systems exist will change the inferences from the low mass systems , just as found by @xcite .    however , of the five high mass systems included by @xcite , only cyg  x1 is a galactic source . if , as seems likely given the existing samples , the high mass x - ray binaries tend to host higher mass black holes than the low mass x - ray binaries , then including the four extragalactic high mass systems without their accompanying low mass compatriots could be biasing the estimates of the mass function in the other direction . as an imperfect compromise , we model the 16 low mass systems following @xcite and include cyg  x1 with a gaussian probability distribution of mean @xmath93 and dispersion @xmath94 ( equation  [ data : case1 ] ) , doubling the uncertainties from @xcite based on the arguments in @xcite .",
    "this gives us a sample of 17 mass estimates .    in order to compare to the earlier studies",
    ", we fit the data using both an exponential and a power - law ( @xmath86 or @xmath95 for @xmath96 ) parametric mass function . for these calculations ,",

    "we find that @xmath1 ( @xmath173 ) , @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) , and @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , so @xmath178 is constrained to be close the plateau in @xmath0 seen in figure  [ fig : profile ] and high enough to largely prevent black hole formation at lower masses where the compactness is dropping rapidly .",
    "as we will see , this is sufficient to lead to a sharp break in the black hole mass function just as is included in the parametric models .",
    "these estimates from fitting the observed black hole mass function are quite similar to the range of @xmath179 to @xmath180 found by @xcite in their core collapse simulations and lower than the limit proposed by @xcite .",
    "the fractions of core collapses producing black holes are @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) , @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , and @xmath183 ( @xmath185 ) , respectively , where the w07 models produce larger numbers of black holes because of the prominent compactness peak near @xmath186 .",
    "if we arbitrarily remove this peak by setting @xmath187 in this regime , the results more closely resemble those for the w02 models .    for the w02 and w07 models we can also examine using the compactness at another mass cut , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , the iron core mass , @xmath153 , or the mass at inner edge of the oxygen burning shell , @xmath155 , as the criterion for forming a black hole .",
    "the procedure is the same in each case , we raise the probability for forming a black hole linearly from zero at one value of the parameter to unity at a higher value . for the @xmath116 w02 models , the relative probabilities of the criteria are @xmath188 for @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath153 and @xmath155 , respectively , where we have normalized the models to the standard @xmath0 model .",
    "for the @xmath116 w07 models , the ratios are @xmath189 .",
    "this general structure holds when we vary the completeness as well .",
    "if we simply marginalize over the completeness ( @xmath126 with a uniform prior ) and the w02 and w07 models , the probabilities of the formation criteria relative to the @xmath0 model are @xmath190 .",
    "the compactness at a smaller mass cut @xmath10 is almost equally good , the compactness at a larger mass cut @xmath11 is moderately worse , the iron core mass is an even poorer model , and the oxygen burning shell mass is the worst model .",
    "arguably , only @xmath155 shows a large enough probability ratio to be rejected at a reasonable confidence level .",

    "the lack of a probability peak near @xmath186 is similar to the effects of @xmath74 .    for comparison to the mass - independent completeness case in figure  [ fig : xi1 ]",
    ", figure  [ fig : xi2 ] shows the results for the w02 and w07 models with @xmath124 and @xmath194 .",

    "if black hole formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at the time of collapse ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and we associate the mass of the resulting black hole with the mass of the helium core ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) then we can constrain the compactness above which black holes form by fitting the observed black hole mass function ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the helium core mass is a natural scale for black hole masses due to either mass loss ( e.g. , @xcite ) or the physics of failed ccsne ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we also , for the first time , include a model for the completeness of the observed sample of black holes and examine its consequences for the constraints on the core collapse parameters .",

    "@xcite found that the parameters of their models of the black hole mass function changed significantly when the high mass binaries were included in the analysis because they tend to have higher average masses . including cyg  x1 is a compromise between excluding all high mass systems ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and including all high mass systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "we exclude the extragalactic high mass systems since there is no equivalent sample of extragalactic low mass systems . where necessary",
    ", we discuss the impact of including cyg  x1 on the results . if we model the data using the parametric methods and models of these previous studies , we obtain similar results .",
    "the first interesting result is that our models based on combining progenitor models with a physical criterion for forming a black hole fit the observed black hole mass function as well as the existing parametric models .",
    "our best model actually has a higher likelihood , but the likelihood ratios are not large enough to be significant . unlike the simple parametric models , the mass functions produced by our models have a great deal of structure ( figure  [ fig : mfunc ] ) created by the rapid variations in compactness with mass ( figures  [ fig : profile0 ] and [ fig : profile ] ) .",
    "we tested five different parameters for predicting the formation of a black hole .",
    "the compactnesses @xmath10 , @xmath0 and @xmath11 of the core of the progenitor at baryonic masses of @xmath12 , @xmath152 and @xmath216 ( equation  [ eqn : compact ] ) , the mass of the iron core @xmath153 and the mass inside the oxygen burning shell @xmath155 .",
    "we considered three sets of stellar models , w02 from @xcite , w07 from @xcite , and w07@xmath115s14 which supplements the w07 models with the denser mass sampling from @xcite .",
    "marginalizing over all our other variables , we find that the compactnesses @xmath10 and @xmath0 produced the highest likelihoods .",
    "the compactness @xmath11 models were somewhat less probable , the iron core mass models still less so , and the oxygen shell mass models were the worst . with overall likelihood ratios relative to the @xmath0 model of @xmath190 none of the other possibilities",
    "are strongly ruled out . @xcite found in their simulations that the compactness was a better predictor of outcomes than the iron core or oxygen shell masses .",
    "we now focus on the @xmath0 models .",
    "the relative probabilities of the w02 , w07 and w07@xmath115s14 @xmath0 models after marginalizing over the completeness model are @xmath204 , favoring the w07 models .",
    "the origin of the differences are due to the relative strengths of the peaks in the compactness as a function of mass near @xmath27-@xmath16 and @xmath217 , which control the relative production of higher and lower mass black holes .",
    "the w02 models have difficulty producing higher mass black holes and so are disfavored .",
    "this estimate is affected by the inclusion of cyg  x1  if cyg  x1 is excluded , the relative probabilities favor the w02 models over the w07 or w07@xmath115s14 models by similar factors .",
    "the w07 and w07@xmath115s14 cases favor models in which the observed black hole mass function is incomplete at high masses , while the w02 case favors models in which it is incomplete at low masses .",
    "this is again a reflection of the relative importance of the two compactness peaks . if we exclude cyg  x1 , thereby dropping the ( probably ) highest mass black hole in the sample , all three models favor a black hole mass function that is incomplete at high masses .",
    "these trends are related to the estimate of the black hole formation probability as a function of initial stellar mass by @xcite . using only the low mass companion systems ,",
    "their models have a low probability of black hole formation at the compactness peak near @xmath186 that produces the higher mass black holes .",
    "this is equivalent to our models reducing the completeness of the observed sample for higher mass black holes .",
    "that our completeness models generally favor incompleteness for high mass systems rather than low mass systems supports the existence of a gap or a deep minimum between the masses of neutrons stars and black holes .    even with a model allowing large variations in the completeness as a function of mass , we obtain interesting constraints on the compactness leading to black hole formation .",
    "we modeled the probability of black hole formation as linearly rising from zero at a minimum compactness @xmath5 to unity at @xmath6 .",
    "the probability of black hole formation should increase monotonically with compactness , but stars of a given mass will really end their lives with a range of compactnesses because of secondary variables other than their initial mass ( e.g. , composition , rotation , binary interactions ) . if these secondary variables produce a spread in the compactness at a given initial mass , the finite width of our transition will mimic much of the effect .",
    "that being said , the maximum likelihood model was always the one with an abrupt transition ( @xmath3 ) , although probability of @xmath218 only declines slowly and the width of the transition is not well constrained . for models in which the completeness is mass - independent",
    ", we find @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) and @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) where @xmath219 is the compactness at which the black hole formation probability is 50% . because the width of the transition is poorly constrained , @xmath178 has smaller uncertainties than @xmath5 .",
    "if we marginalize over the completeness model , we find @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) . the upper limits change little , but the lower limits become softer because of the contribution from models with high incompleteness at low black hole mass .",
    "these results are for the w07 models , but the results for the other two cases are similar",
    ".    the fraction of core collapses predicted to form black holes is relatively high .",
    "for the w07 model with no mass - dependent completeness corrections , @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , while after marginalizing over the completeness corrections , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the results for the other model sequences are similar .",
    "this fraction assumes a salpeter imf where all stars from @xmath220 to the maximum mass in the model sequence undergo core collapse .",
    "it also assumes that the probability of black hole formation for @xmath221 is unity , @xmath222 .",
    "lowering @xmath60 or @xmath223 would reduce @xmath77 , while raising @xmath60 would increase @xmath77 .",
    "for example , raising the minimum mass for core collapse from @xmath9 to @xmath224 raises @xmath77 by 18% .",
    "the probability of black hole formation as a function of initial stellar mass is a complex function reflecting the structure of @xmath225 .",
    "generically , the probability drops rapidly below @xmath226 in order to minimize the production of low mass black holes and is unity near @xmath27-@xmath16 and @xmath217 where the compactness peaks . at other mass ranges ,",
    "the probabilities vary greatly with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    the most interesting directions for expansion would be to consider other potential indicators of outcomes , such as binding energies , other sequences of stellar models , and other possible definitions of the black hole mass .",
    "in , particular , many model sequences of ccsn progenitors span only portions of the mass range of interest , frequently with large spacings in mass . in order to carry out the analysis",
    ", this approach requires the full mass range from @xmath227 to @xmath228 . while the differences between the densely sampled @xcite and the sparser @xcite models in the mass range @xmath229 seem to have little consequence for our results , we are concerned that the sparse sampling of the @xcite models near @xmath230 compared to the more densely sampled @xcite models may drive some differences in the contribution of stars in this mass range to the black hole mass function .",
    "our approach , including models of sample completeness , could also be used to fit sequences of fall - back models ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) to the black hole mass function .",
    "we have not done so here because these fall - back models produce continuous mass functions that are completely incompatible with the existing data .",
    "we used a fairly minimalist prior on the fraction of failed ccsne based on the galactic ccsn rate and the absence of any neutrino detections of core collapse ( @xcite ) .",
    "stronger priors could be developed based on the detections of ccsne progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , limits on the rate of failed ccsn ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the neutron star mass function ( @xcite ) , the diffuse neutrino background produced by ccsne ( @xcite , @xcite ) or comparisons of the star and ccsn rates ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the present results are consistent with the available constraints , and roughly predict the mass range and fraction of failed ccsne needed to explain the red supergiant problem .",
