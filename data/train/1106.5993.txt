    "the ab - initio , density - functional theory ( dft ) based determination of structural and electronic properties of correlated systems remains up today an outstanding challenge .",
    "the most relevant bottleneck rests in the fact that advanced approaches that are general and powerful enough to tackle the description of strong - correlated systems are also usually heavily demanding in terms of required computing resources .",
    "this limits the system size that can be practically afforded to few tents of atoms per unit cell . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the interesting behaviours encountered in correlated systems requires large cell size already at the level of bulk properties , due the possible coexistence of several juxtapposed orderings ( structural , magnetic , orbital and charge ordering ) .",
    "furthermore , several much celebrated phenomenologies involve doping ( high - tc superconductivity in cuprates , colossal magnetoresistivity in manganites , magnetic ordering in diluted semiconductors , etc . )",
    "whose treatment at generic concentration is a formidable computing task ; finally , oxide interfaces and multilayers which are ground of recent intriguing discoveries such as 2d electron gas behaviour@xcite may require even larger simulation effort .    as a matter of fact , we are in the need of treating about one or two hundred atom systems , a size that can be only afforded at a computational cost substantially similar to that of standard local ( spin)density functional ( l(s)da ) theory or its generalized gradient ( gga ) version .",
    "beyond - lsda approaches which are agile enough to satisfy this requirement are very few : the very popular lda+u@xcite is certainly one of those ; a later approach with similar characteristics is the psic , implemented in the past in two different setting : plane - wave and ultrasoft pseudopotential basis set@xcite in the framework of the home - made pwsic code ; local orbital and pseudopotential basis set ( also called asic)@xcite in the framework of the siesta code . lda+u and psic / asic move from different conceptual viewpoints : the former introduces an effective coulomb repulsion which is tipically mistreated in lsda ; the latter subtracts from the lsda functional an approximate ( i.e. atomic orbital - averaged ) self - interaction ( si ) , that is the unphysical interaction of an electron with its own generated potential .    despite this difference , the two theories act in similar way , i.e. correcting the lsda eigenvalues by a quantity linearly dependent on the orbital occupations ; in fact , the psic can be substantially viewed as an all - orbital generalization of the lda+u , but with two relevant advantages over the latter : the capability of curing the lsda failures in more general situations ( i.e. not limited to magnetic and insulating systems ) and the absence of an explicit parametric dependence . in psic / asic , indeed , the function of u si replaced by the atomic self - interaction potentials , which are extracted from the free atom ( thus they are universal , i.e. only dependent on the atomic species of the systems ) and then plug into the band structure hamiltonian . at variance with more fundamental si removal strategies such as the original perdew - zunger approach@xcite ( pz - sic ) , or the later generalization to extended systems@xcite which draw on dramatic complications in formalism and conceptual interpretations@xcite , the psic keep all the simplicity tipical of lda / gga : a single - particle potential which is orbital - independent and translationally invariant ( i.e. obeying bloch symmetry ) , and energy functional invariant under unitary rotation of the occupied eigenstates .",
    "the psic / asic approach demonstrated a consistent accuracy in the description of the electronic properties for a vast range of systems@xcite , at a computational cost not much larger than that of the lsda itself ( in particular the asic is the implementation of choice for large - size systems as it can easily afford few hundreds atom simulations , while the heavier psic can be seen as the standard reference for what concern the methodological accuracy ) . despite these virtues , psic and asic",
    "have had a relatively small following with respect to the lda+u so far , mainly in reason of the serious hindrance represented by the lack of variationality : in ref.the psic potential is in fact generated as an ansatz on the single - particle kohn - sham ( ks ) potential , not from a germinal energy functional .",
    "this shortcoming precludes , in practice , the access to ground - state total energy properties .    in this paper",
    "we point to overcome this limitation , presenting a fully variational version of psic / asic ( hereafter called vpsic , to be distinguished by their previous siblings ) built out of an energy functional which recovers , by euler - lagrange derivative , a set of single - particle ks equations essentially similar to those of the elder psic / asic scheme , thus keeping the successful description of the electronic properties , but adding up the possibility to deliver all those ground - state properties expected by standard ab - initio theories .    here",
    "we describe the new formulations and give wide evidence of the aforementioned capabilities presenting results for a range of bulks ( including non magnetic and magnetic titanates and manganites ) and molecules .",
    "extended systems are treated using the plane - wave basis implementation , the molecules by the atomic orbital basis implementation .",
    "we remark that other vpsic results have been already presented in separate recent publications : a lenghtly description of the properties of transition metal monoxides@xcite ; a detailed account of the properties of 2d electron gas formation at the srtio@xmath0/laalo@xmath0 interface@xcite ; together with the present article , they furnish a solid evidence of the effectiveness of the new method in the study of generic systems characterized by strong to moderate electron correlation .",
    "the article is organized as it follows : in section [ form ] the general formulation is illustrated ; in section [ res_ext ] results for non magnetic oxide insulators ( subsection [ res_para ] ) , titanates ( subsection [ res_tita ] ) and manganites ( subsection [ res_manga ] ) are presented .",
    "section [ res_mol ] is devoted to illustrate results for molecules .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we draw our summary and conclusions .",
    "several specific implementations are included in the appendices : in [ app_1 ] and [ app_2 ] we present an extension of the vpsic energy functional and forces formulations , respectively , for the case of ultrasoft pseudopotentials ( uspp ) , while [ app_3 ] and [ app_4 ] are dedicated to the description of vpsic energy functional and forces formulation specific for atomic orbital basis set .",
    "in this section we present the generic variational formulation , not related to any specific basis function implementation .",
    "we start from the following vpsic energy functional :    @xmath1\\,=\\,e^{lsd}[\\{\\psi\\}]-{1\\over 2}\\sum_{ij\\nu\\sigma}\\,{\\cal e}^{si}_{ij\\sigma\\nu}\\,p^{\\sigma}_{ji\\nu } \\label{vpsic_etot}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the usual lsda energy functional :    @xmath3 = t_s[\\{\\psi\\}]+e_h[n]+e_{xc}[n_+,n_-]+e_{ion}[\\{\\psi\\ } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    written as sum of ( non - interacting ) kinetic ( t@xmath4 ) , hartree ( e@xmath5 ) , exchange - correlation ( e@xmath6 ) , and electron - ion ( e@xmath7 ) energies ( @xmath8 are single - particle wavefunctions , n@xmath9 and n@xmath10 up- and down - polarized electron densities , and n = n@xmath9+n@xmath10 ) .",
    "eq.[vpsic_etot ] follows the spirit of the original perdew - zunger procedure@xcite ( hereafter called pz - sic ) , and subtracts from the lsda total energy a si term written as a sum of effective single - particle si energies ( @xmath11 ) rescaled by some orbital occupations @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath13 , @xmath14 are sets ( @xmath15,@xmath16 , @xmath15,@xmath17 ) of atomic quantum numbers ( typically relative to a minimal atomic wavefunction basis set ) while @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate spin and atomic site , respectively ( non - diagonal formulation is necessary to enforce covariancy , thus @xmath13=(@xmath15,@xmath16 ) , @xmath14=(@xmath15,@xmath17 ) ) .",
    "most of the peculiarity of the vpsic approach resides in the way the second term of eq.[vpsic_etot ] is written for an extended system whose eigenfunctions are bloch states ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the orbital occupations are then calculated as projection of bloch states onto localized ( atomic ) orbitals ( hereafter indicated as @xmath21 ) :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 are fermi occupancies . for the effective si energies we adopt a similar approach",
    "@xmath24    where @xmath25 is the projection function associated to the si potential of the @xmath26 atomic orbital centered on atom @xmath19 :    @xmath27\\,\\phi_{i\\nu}({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}_{\\nu } ) , \\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "we express the hartree plus exchange - correlation atomic si potential @xmath30 in radial approximation : @xmath30 = @xmath31+v_{xc}[n_{l_i\\nu},0]$ ] = @xmath32/\\partial n_{l_i\\nu}$ ] ( calculated at full polarization : n = n@xmath9 , n@xmath10=0 ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath33 are normalization coefficients :    @xmath34\\,\\phi_{l_i m_j}({\\bf r } ) \\label{cij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath15=@xmath35 .",
    "they are purely atomic and do not depend on the atomic positions .",
    "the use of projectors @xmath36 in eq.[epsi - si ] is aimed at casting the si energy in fully non - local form ( analogous to the fully - non local pseudopotential form due to kleinman and bylander@xcite ) which consent a huge saving of computational effort when calculated in reciprocal space .    to grab the idea behind equations [ epsi - si ] , [ gamma ] , and [ cij ] , notice that in the limit of large atomic separation , the bloch states @xmath37 are brought back to atomic orbitals @xmath38 , and @xmath39 to atomic si energies @xmath40 ( discarding spin and atomic index ) :    @xmath41 + v_{xc}[n_i({\\bf r}),0 ] \\right ) \\label{e_at}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , the orbital occupations @xmath42 ( if suitably normalized ) act as scaling factors for the atomic si energies , assumed as the upper limit of the si correction amplitude .",
    "we remark that in the atomic limit eq.[vpsic_etot ] goes back to the pz - sic total energy espression only for what concern the hartree si part , while our si exchange - correlation energy density ( ( 1/2)@xmath43 $ ] ) departs from the pz - sic espression @xmath44 $ ] , since @xmath45 ) .    from eq.[vpsic_etot ]",
    "we obtain the corresponding vpsic ks equations through the usual euler - lagrange derivative :    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 are vpsic eigenvalues , and ;    @xmath49    @xmath50+v_{xc}[n_+({\\bf r}),n_-({\\bf r})]+v_{ion}({\\bf r } ) \\label{h_lsd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the usual ks lsda hamiltonian , and :    @xmath51    @xmath52    the first sum term in curl parenthesis in eq.[ks - sic ] corresponds to the si potential projector written as in the original vpsic ks equations .",
    "since the two sums in curl parhenthesis are two ways to describe substantially the same physical quantity ( i.e. the si potential ) , in practice they give similar results when applied onto the bloch state .",
    "it follows that eq.[ks - sic ] describes an energy spectrum substantially similar to that of the non variational scheme , but with the added bonus to derive from the vpsic energy functional .",
    "in dft methods it is customary to rewrite the total energy in terms of eigenvalue sum . indicating with @xmath53 the lsda eigenvalues , it is immediate to verify that :    @xmath54    @xmath55    then eq . [ vpsic_etot ] can be rewritten as :    @xmath1\\,=\\,\\tilde{e}^{lsd}[\\{\\psi\\}]+{1\\over 2}\\sum_{ij\\sigma\\nu}\\ , { \\cal e}^{si}_{ij\\sigma\\nu}\\,p^{\\sigma}_{ji\\nu } \\label{esic2}\\ ] ]    where :    @xmath56 = \\sum_{n{\\bf k}\\sigma}\\ , f_{n{\\bf k}}^{\\sigma}\\ , \\tilde{\\epsilon}_{nk\\sigma } + e_{hxc}[n_+({\\bf r}),n_-({\\bf r } ) ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath57 \\label{esic3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    is the lsda energy functional but now including the vpsic eigenvalues in place of the lsda eigenvalues .",
    "finally , in the original psic formulation the si @xmath30 potential is rescaled by a relaxation factor @xmath58=1/2 , to take into account the screening ( i.e. the suppression ) of atomic self - interaction caused by the surrounding charge of the other atoms ( see ref.@xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "a careful testing on a large series of compounds @xcite confirmed that this relaxation value is the most adequate for almost all the examined bulk systems , whereas for molecules the atomic si ( @xmath58=1 ) is the most appropriate choice .",
    "we mantain this recipe in the present formulation , using the 1/2 factor only for calculations related to extended systems .      from the general espression of eq.[vpsic_etot ]",
    "two interesting subcases can be obtained : assumig fixed ( i.e. non self - consistent ) orbital occupations @xmath59 , in eq.[ks - sic ] the second term in curl brackets vanishes and the vpsic - ks equations reduce to those of the original psic scheme of ref .",
    "( indeed , it was previously pointed out@xcite that the original scheme becomes variational at fixed orbital occupations ) .",
    "another useful subcase is obtained replacing eq.[epsi - si ] with a simplified expression :    @xmath60    where the atomic @xmath61 ( in radial approximation ) is given by eq.[e_at ] . using eq.[esic - simple ] , previous eqs.[vpsic_etot ] and [ ks - sic ] :    @xmath62\\,=\\,e^{lsd}[\\{\\psi\\}]-{1\\over 2}\\sum_{ij\\nu\\sigma}\\ ,   p^{\\sigma}_{ij\\nu}\\,p^{\\sigma}_{ji\\nu}\\,\\epsilon^{si}_{j\\nu }   \\nonumber\\ ] ]    @xmath63+{1\\over 2}\\sum_{ij\\nu\\sigma}\\ , p^{\\sigma}_{ij\\nu}\\,p^{\\sigma}_{ji\\nu}\\,\\epsilon^{si}_{j\\nu }   \\label{avpsic_etot}\\ ] ]    @xmath64    these simplified vpsic formalism ( hereafter indicated as vpsic@xmath65 ) is a computationally convenient alternative ( especially in terms of required memory ) to perform structural optimizations in large size - systems . in the results section",
    "we will give evidence that at least in case of non - magnetic semiconductors and insulators it furnishes electronic and structural properties in good accord with the vpsic .",
    "however it is tipically less satisfying for the electronic properties of magnetic systems .      in vpsic",
    "the atomic forces formulation follows from the usual hellmann - feynmann procedure .",
    "it is obtained as the lsda expression augmented by a further additive contribution due to the atomic - site dependence of the si projectors :    @xmath66\\over \\partial { \\bf r}_{\\nu}}\\,=\\,{\\bf f}_{\\nu}^{lsd}+ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath67 + c.c . \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath68\\ , \\langle\\psi_{n{\\bf k}}^{\\sigma}| { \\partial \\phi_{i,\\nu}\\over \\partial { \\bf r}_{\\nu } } \\rangle   \\langle\\,\\phi_{j,\\nu}|\\psi_{n{\\bf k}}^{\\sigma}\\rangle + c.c \\right\\ } \\label{forces}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    whereas in the simplified version , we have , in addition to @xmath69 the quantity :    @xmath70    in writing eqs.[forces ] and [ asi_forces ] , we have assumed that the force on a given atom @xmath19 only depends on the single atomic projector centered on @xmath19 .",
    "this is not necessarely true if the orbital occupations are to be re - orthonormalized on the cell .",
    "this choice , which complicates sensitively the above formulation , will be discussed in detail in the appendices , together with the generalization of the method to either plane - waves plus uspp or local - orbital plus pseudopotential approach .",
    "we have pointed out in section [ form ] that there is a substantial formal similarity between the ks equations derived for the vpsic and the elder psic / asic ks equations .",
    "our tests assess that the long series of results for the electronic properties obtained with the latter in the last few years remain valid even in the framework of the new theory , which gives small differences in e.g. band energies and density of states .",
    "hereafter we consider as test cases for vpsic , materials either never tackled before ( it is the case of titanates ) , or afforded in the past ( e.g. camno@xmath0 ) but now revisited to specifically address total energy - derived properties , such as equilibrium structure and magnetic exchange - interactios .    specifically , we selected three classes of systems which well represent the broad spectrum of the vpsic capability , and at the same time are interesting compounds in itself either from conceptual or technological viewpoint : wide - gap oxide insulators , magnetic titanates representative of 3d t@xmath71 mott - insulating perovskites , and magnetic manganites representative of 3d e@xmath72 charge - transfer insulating perovskites .    regarding our technicalities , calculations are carried out with ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite and a plane - wave basis set with cut off ranging from 30 to 35 ryd depending on the specific system , 6@xmath736@xmath736 special k - point grids for self - consistent calculations , 10@xmath7310@xmath7310 special k - points and linear tetrahedron interpolation method for density of states .",
    "the ceperley - alder - perdew - zunger local - density approximation is used for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "structural relaxations are carried out with a convergency threshold of 1 mry / bohr on the calculated forces .      as prototypes of non - magnetic wide - gap insulators we selected tio@xmath74 rutile and two perovskite oxides , laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 in their cubic bulk structure . nowadays",
    "these materials are ravely investigate for their potential use in the field of functional oxides , thus the abundance of theoretical and experimental results make them ideal test cases for innovative theoretical methods .",
    "for non magnetic oxides the level of accuracy of standard lda calculations may vary according to the examined property : typically a good rendition of structural properties is juxtaposed to an unsatisfactory match of the calculated band structure and interband transition energies , involving the well - known underestimation of the fundamental band gap , and the poor description of transition - metal @xmath75 and ( on a minor extent ) oxygen @xmath76 states .",
    "our results will demonstrate that the vpsic achieves a sistematical improvement of the electronic properties over lsda , while preserving a substantially similar accuracy for what concerns structural properties .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the detail of the results may ( and usually does ) depend crucially on a number of computational technicalities typical of our supercell simulations , which goes beyond the formalism ( e.g. the type of wavefunction basis set , the type of used pseudopotentials , etc . ) .",
    "thus , in order to reach an unbiased evaluation it is always useful to refer the psic results not only to the experiment values but even to their lda counterpart , obtained in condition of identical technicalities .    .direct",

    "[ tab_gap ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     looking deeper at the dos important differences appear in the lsda and vpsic / vpsic@xmath65 description : for both the p - d valence manifold shows a double peaked structure , in agreement with x - ray ( xps ) and ultraviolet ( ups ) photoemission@xcite , but the orbital character of the peaks is different : in lsda the big part of t@xmath71 spectral weight is right below the vbt , while the tail region from -5 ev to -7 ev is mainly o 2p .",
    "the vpsic / vpsic@xmath65 on the other hand recovers a spectral redistribution more in line with the observations , with prevalently o 2p states near vbt , and the highest peak of t@xmath71 states at the bottom of the valence bands . the lsda failure is clearly related to the insufficient t@xmath71 spin splitting , which amounts to a mere 2.5 ev and leaves the majority t@xmath71 much too high in the energy . in vpsic",
    "the t@xmath71 splitting increases up to about 9 ev , which is consistent with the estimated value of u@xcite .",
    "notice that a single energy parameter is not enough , however , to properly locate the t@xmath71 states , since a consistent portions of those is also present in the 4 ev - wide region below the vbt , where the p - d hybridization is strong .",
    "in lsda we obtain an energy gap of 0.42 ev .",
    "looking at the band picture , the vbt runs flat between x and w , while the cbb e@xmath72 is flat between @xmath81 and x , in agreement with previous lda calculations ( see e.g. ) ; in vpsic the gap is 1.01 ev , and both vbt and cbb are flat between @xmath81 and x. above the energy gap , lsda describes the 2 ev - wide majority e@xmath72 bands overlapped with the very narrow minority t@xmath71 peak , whereas in vpsic / vpsic@xmath65 the latter lies about 2 ev above the centroid of the e@xmath72 . while we could not find in literature a clear determination of the band gap value ,",
    "interband transitions extracted from photoemission@xcite and optical conductivity measurements@xcite seem to be very consistent with the vpsic calculation .",
    "specifically , the distance between o 2p and majority @xmath82 peaks ( @xmath833 ev ) and between o 2p and minority @xmath82 peak ( @xmath83 6.5 ev ) compares excellently with the respective values 3.07 ev and 6.49 ev extracted by lorentz oscillator fitting of conductivity spectra reported in ref .. also quite consistent , albeit with a bit larger value ( 3.7 ev ) for the o 2p - mn e@xmath72 transition , is the valence band spectra deduced in ref . by fitting a ci cluster model to xps data .     for af - g ( solid symbols ) and fm ( open symbols ) ordering .",
    "notice that differences in total energy due to different methods have no physical meaning and have been arbitrarily translated in the figure for the sake of clarity .",
    "[ struc_cmo],width=245 ]    now we move to examine structural and magnetic properties . in fig.[struc_cmo ] total energies as a functon of lattice parameter for af - g and fm phases are reported , calculated with lsda , vpsic , and vpsic@xmath65 .",
    "values of the equilibrium lattice are reported in tab.[tab_camno ] .",
    "the trend is similar to that seen in section [ res_para ] for wide - gap oxides : vpsic and vpsic@xmath65 respectively reduces and expands the volume with respect to the lsda value .",
    "here however , the correction of vpsic is very tiny , and both lsda and vpsic gives lattice constant in very good accord ( within 1% ) with the experimental value . on the other hand ,",
    "the vpsic@xmath65 is much less satisfying , and the predicted equilibrum lattice overestimate the experiment by @xmath832.5% . for",

    "the dos are also reported for clarity .",
    "lenght of red arrows indicate the amount of t@xmath71 charge without the lowest t@xmath71 peak .",
    "[ dos2_cmo],width=302 ]    it is interesting speculating on the remarkably different magnetic behaviour described by the three methods . this mainly reflects the difference in the t@xmath71 spectral weight seen in fig.[dos_cmo ] , specifically the substantial dos shift from the top to the bottom of the p - d band manifold when moving from lsda to vpsic and to vpsic@xmath65 .",
    "as a quantification of this effect , in fig.[dos2_cmo ] we report the integrated charge of majority t@xmath71 and e@xmath72 bands as described by the three methods : all methods describe a filled ( i.e. integrated to 3 ) t@xmath71 state , but if we evaluate the amount of t@xmath71 charge located in the upper part of the valence band region which does not include the towering lower - end peak and mainly hybridizes with oxygens ( quantified in fig.[dos2_cmo ] by the vertical red arrows ) we find that this charge in lsda is about 73% , in vpsic just 43% , and finally in vpsic@xmath65 a mere 33% of the whole majority t@xmath71 charge .",
    "our interpretation is the following : the lower - end t@xmath71 peak is too low in energy and too little hybridized with oxygens to give a meaningful superexchange contribution ( through t@xmath71-p@xmath89 @xmath90-type bonding ) .",
    "thus while the t@xmath71 spectral weight in transferred to the lower end of the valence band , the e@xmath72 charge distribution remains substantially similar across the three renditions , and its fm contribution takes place and even becomes dominant according to vpsic@xmath65 . notice that the e@xmath72 charges integrates to a remarkable 1/2 electron per orbital at the vbt ( in agreement with previous calculations@xcite )",
    "thus it represent a prototypical case of fm coupling ( via e@xmath72-p@xmath91 hybridization ) according to goodenough - kanamori rules@xcite .    in summary , the vpsic seems to furnish a very consistent description of cmo for what concern electronic , structural , and magnetic properties .",
    "values calculated in vpsic compares well with the experiments and with results of other beyond - local approaches , when available , correcting the most obvious deficiencies of lsda . on the other hand the vpsic@xmath65",

    "we see that although the vpsic homo eigenvalues are generally significantly lower than the corresponding lsda ones ( see table  [ iptab ] ) , the homo - lumo gaps differ by a smaller extent .",
    "this is because in contrast to other methods such as lsda+u  @xcite wherein the occupied levels are pushed lower and the unoccupied ones are pushed higher relative to the lsda spectrum , within vpsic the whole spectrum is corrected lower with the occupied and empty levels being shifted by different amounts depending upon their orbital character .",
    "for instance , the mean absolute difference between the lsda and vpsic homo - lumo gaps for the test set in table  [ gaptab ] comes out to be @xmath832.52 ev while the correction to the homo levels alone with respect to lsda is around 4 ev . in general ,",
    "vpsic is expected to open the homo - lumo gap substantially in systems where the occupied and un - occupied ks eigenstates have markedly different atomic orbital projections .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that in contrast to explicity orbital dependent methods such as pz - sic , vpsic does not exhibit the derivative discontinuity at integer occupations .",
    "thus the eigenvalue of the highest occupied orbital relaxes continuously across fractional occupations although the range of eigenvalue relaxation is generally smaller than in lsda .",
    "in summary , we have introduced the first - principles vpsic approach , a variational generalization of the method formerly known as psic / asic , based on the idea of removing the spurious self - interaction from the local - density functional energy . in vpsic",
    "the self - interaction is removed in effective albeit approximate ( i.e. orbitally - averaged ) manner , which gives several advantages over the full si removal ( applied e.g. in the pz - sic approach or related methods for extended systems ) such as the conservation of translational invariance ( i.e. bloch theorem ) and the invariance of the energy under unitary rotations of the occupied ks eigenfunction manifold .",
    "the vpsic approach emerges as applicable to a vast series of systems ( insulators and metals , magnetic and non - magnetic , extended or finite ) with an overall satisfying accuracy , and furthermore not significally more demanding than lda / gga from a computational viewpoint .",
    "we have implemented the method in two methodological frameworks : plane - waves basis set and ultrasoft pseudopotentials , and local - orbital basis set plus norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "the first was applied here to extended systems : non - magnetic oxides , magnetic titanates , and magnetic manganites , the latter to a vast range of molecules , testing structural and electronic properties .",
    "overall , the performance of the vpsic can be synthesyzed as it follows : the predicted equilibrium structures are substantially in the same range of accuracy than the lda / lsda , tipically reducing , on average , the bond lengths predicted by the latter .",
    "this corresponds to an average underestimate of the experimental lattice constant by about 1% for bulk systems , 2% for molecule bond lenght . on the other hand the electronic properties",
    "are highly improved with respect to lda / gga , with band gaps of bulks , and ionization potentials and electron affinities for molecules tipically within 10% from the respective experimental determinations .",
    "these preliminary results encourage us to pursue further explorations of the vpsic approach for finite and extended systems alike .",
    "for the study of large - size magnetic and strong - correlated systems , the ultrasoft pseudopotential ( uspp ) method@xcite associated to plane - wave basis set , represent a formidable tool which allows the use of cut - off energies as low as 30 - 40 ryd even for hard transition metal ions such as mn or cu .",
    "the trade - off for this invaluable computational efficiency is a sensible complication of the vpsic formulas presented in section [ form ] . in the following",
    "we furnish the vpsic formulation adapted to the uspp formalism , which is our implementation of choice . for brevity",
    "however here we do not revisit the basic uspp formulation ( for which we remand the readers to the original articles ) , but only focus on the additional part specific for vpsic .    in the uspp approach the atomic valence charge",
    "is partitioned in outer ultrasoft ( us ) and intra - core , augmented ( au ) contributions , of whom only the first changes self - consistently with the surrounding chemical environment .",
    "thus the charge associated to the bloch states @xmath20 appearing in section [ form ] only represents the very smooth us part .",
    "the bloch states obey the following generalized orthonormality conditions :    @xmath133    where the overal matrix @xmath134 is given by :    @xmath135    here @xmath136 and @xmath137 are atomic projector functions and augmented charge , respectively , characteristics of the uspp formalism , and ( @xmath138,@xmath139 ) label atomic quantum numbers ( @xmath140,@xmath141 ) ( @xmath142 @xmath143 0 only for @xmath140=@xmath144 ) .",
    "consistently , the total charge density is generalized as :    @xmath145    @xmath146    where @xmath147 are augmented atomic charge densities .",
    "within this generalized framework , the vpsic energy functional described in eq.[vpsic_etot ] only includes the ultrasoft ( us - sic ) part . in order to recover the full vpsic energy functional , a further augmented contribution",
    "must be added :    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the matrix of bloch state projections onto the beta - function basis :    @xmath150    and @xmath151 are si energy associated to the augmented atomic charges @xmath152 :    @xmath153 . \\label{qij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( in radial simmetry @xmath154$]=@xmath155 $ ] for @xmath141 @xmath143 @xmath156 ) .",
    "notice that we use different indices for the uspp projector ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) and for the si projector ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , since the two basis set are conceptually and practically different : the latter is built on a minimal set of atomic orbitals , and to be physically sound it should be associated to bound atomic states ; on the other hand in order to improve the uspp transferability it is customary to include in the ( @xmath138,@xmath139 ) matrix more than one state per angular moment ( tipically the bound atomic state plusd one unbound state relative to some diagnostic energy reference ) .",
    "this difference introduces some ambiguities in eq.[qij ] relative to the definition of @xmath157 $ ] and p@xmath158 .",
    "the ambiguity can be solved by associating the same atomic @xmath30 ( relative to the bound state ) to all the beta projectors with same angular momentum @xmath140 .",
    "another possibility is rewriting the vpsic - au energy as it follows :    @xmath159\\,=\\,-{1\\over 2}\\sum_{ij\\nu\\sigma}\\ , p^{\\sigma}_{ij\\nu}\\,p^{\\sigma}_{ji\\nu}\\,\\epsilon^{au}_{i\\nu } \\label{eau - simp}\\ ] ]    where :    @xmath160    is just the augmented - only si energy relative to the atomic state @xmath13 at full occupancy , and can be directly calculated in the atom .",
    "the use of the simplified eq.[eau - simp ] bypass altogether the explicit presence of the augmented charges , thus greatly simplifying the vpsic au energy functional calculation .",
    "since our many test cases reveal that eqs.[eau ] and [ eau - simp ] give indeed very similar results , we decide to adopt the latter as standard choice .",
    "eq.[eau - simp ] brings a corresponding contribution to the vpsic ks equations :    @xmath161    finally , the orbital occupations defined in eq.[occ ] must be also generalized as :    @xmath162    where the ultrasoft atomic orbitals @xmath38 have been replaced by    @xmath163    with @xmath134 given in eq.[overl ] .",
    "thus , we have :    @xmath164    and    @xmath165    is the overlap matrix in the atomic orbital basis set . by construction",
    "this is hermitian and also positive - definite , so its square root matrix can always be defined in the following , unique way : since ( let s drop the atomic index ) @xmath166$]=0 , @xmath134 can be diagonalized in the ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) subspace , and from its eigenvalues @xmath167 we have @xmath168= @xmath169 @xmath170 .",
    "the latter is finally rotated back to the original ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) basis set to obtain @xmath171 .",
    "the replacement of simple atomic - site centered @xmath38 orbitals with the @xmath172 orbitals given by eq.[phi_norm ] ( known as lwdin orthonormalization @xcite ) is required by the necessity to enforce , at any @xmath173 , the orthonormality conditions @xmath174=@xmath175 , and in turn , the correct normalization of the orbital occupation matrix defined in eq.[occ_norm ] : ( upon diagonalization ) @xmath176 and @xmath177n , with n the total number of electrons in the cell .",
    "these constraints are essential to the interpretation of @xmath178 as physically sound orbital occupancies .",
    "on the other hand , the lwdin renormalization implies a remarkable complicacy in the forces formulation , since it is clear from eqs.[phi_norm ] and [ sij ] that @xmath179 is not simply centered on a single atomic site , but includes contributions from the overlap with all other atomic orbitals @xmath180 as well as beta functions @xmath181 of the cell .",
    "since the forces formulation in the case of lwdin - normalized orbitals may be useful even in other methodological contexts ( e.g. in the lda+u method , whose hamiltonian is also written in terms of orbital occupancies ) we dedicate the next section to describe it in full detail .",
    "in case of uspp formalism the forces espression given in eq.[forces ] ( or eq.[asi_forces ] if we the simplified approach is considered ) must be generalized in order to include the contribution generated by the additional au energy in [ eau - simp ] :    @xmath182\\over \\partial { \\bf r}_{\\nu } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath183    in plane waves basis set the implementation of eqs.[forces ] , [ asi_forces ] , or [ au_forces ] is rather straightforward except for one ingredient which requires attention : the atomic orbital derivative .",
    "the simplest case is that of atomic orbitals which remain centered on the atomic positions ( i.e. orbitals which simply translate along with their reference atom displacement ) . in this case",
    "the force on a given atom @xmath184 only depends on the change of the orbitals sited on @xmath19 , and the orbital derivative is easily calculated as :    @xmath185    @xmath186    where clearly @xmath38 = @xmath187 , and @xmath188 = @xmath189 . however , as discussed in the previous session , orbitals @xmath38 must be replaced by @xmath179 , and the forces equation generalized accordingly :    @xmath66\\over \\partial { \\bf r}_{\\nu}}\\,=\\,{\\bf f}_{\\nu}^{lsd}+ \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath190    @xmath191    @xmath192    where the first two terms account for the us contribution , and the third for the au part .",
    "the presence of lwdin - normalized orbitals brings one more sum over atomic positions in the second and third term , since now the displacement of one single atom in @xmath184 changes in principles all the orbitals , not just those sited on @xmath184 .",
    "the lwdin orbital derivatives gives :    @xmath193    @xmath194    ( where sum over repeated indices is understood ) .",
    "let s start considering the first term :    @xmath195    @xmath196 \\delta_{\\mu'\\nu } + \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath197   \\delta_{\\nu'\\nu } \\label{der_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here the first term in square brackets select the contribution to the derivative due to the atomic orbital @xmath198 displacement , while the second term select the contribution due to the beta functions displacement .",
    "despite the apparent intricacy eq.[der_1 ] is rather straightforward to calculate in plane waves , since all these derivatives are easily obtained through eq.[orb_der ] .",
    "more involved is the calculation of the second term in eq.[lowdin_der ] , which includes an uncommon square root matrix derivative .",
    "we can proceed as following ( dropping the atomic indices for brevity ) : from @xmath199=@xmath200 we obtain :    @xmath201    the left side of eq.[der_2 ] can be transformed using the following espression :    @xmath202    where @xmath200 can be easily obtained from @xmath203 ( just like @xmath204 , as explained in the previous section ) .",
    "then we need to calculate the overlap matrix derivative ( reintroducing atomic indices for clarity ) :    @xmath205    @xmath206    whose esplicit espression is clearly similar to what already reported in eq.[der_1 ] , and we can give it as understood .",
    "so , the matrix at the left side of eq.[der_2 ] is determined .",
    "now looking at the right side , we see that if @xmath204 commute with its derivative , the latter is easily extracted as :    @xmath207    however , they do not generally commute ( except when the hermitian matrix @xmath204 is also real ) and eq.[der_4 ] does not hold .",
    "thus , we need to solve eq.[der_2 ] , which is nothing but a lyapunov matrix equation of the form @xmath208=@xmath209+@xmath210 , where the known terms are @xmath211=@xmath204 and @xmath208=@xmath212 , and @xmath114=@xmath213 .",
    "the general lyapunov equation can be solved exactly , but for the specific values of @xmath211 and @xmath208 we can apply the simple strategy proposed in ref .",
    ", that we repeat here for the commodity of the reader : we can rewrite @xmath211=@xmath214 , where @xmath215 and @xmath216 can be easily determined as the diagonalized matrix and the basis change matrix ; then we can multiply both members of eq .",
    "[ der_2 ] by @xmath217 on the left , and @xmath216 on the right :    @xmath218    introducing @xmath219=@xmath220 and @xmath221=@xmath222 , eq.[der_5 ] can be rewritten as @xmath219 = @xmath223 + @xmath224 , which is now trivially solved , given the diagonal character of @xmath215 :    @xmath225    once @xmath221 is determined , the unkonwn @xmath114 can be finally obtained as @xmath226 .",
    "as the vpsic correction is based on a projection of the occupied ks orbital manifold onto a localized subspace of atomic orbitals , the formalism naturally lends itself to implementation within a localized orbital basis set framework . in this appendix",
    "we provide some details of the current vpsic implementation within the siesta  @xcite code .",
    "the first step in setting up the vpsic algroithm is to construct a minimal set of atomic orbitals @xmath227 and the associated projectors @xmath228 which will be used to calculate the occupation numbers  ( eqn .  [ occ ] ) and effective si energies  ( eqn .  [ epsi - si ] ) . within siesta ,",
    "the functions @xmath229 are numerical pseudo - atomic orbitals with a finite range constructed as solutions of the atomic schrodinger equation with an additional confining potential at the cutoff radius @xmath230  @xcite .",
    "the finite extent of the functions @xmath229 also ensures that the corresponding sic projectors @xmath25 ( eqn .",
    "[ gamma ] ) also vanish beyond the cutoff @xmath230 . in the current implementation ,",
    "the sic potential @xmath231 $ ] in equation  [ gamma ] is obtained from a full pz - sic - lsda  @xcite calculation for a free atom and imported into siesta via a pseudopotential .",
    "an appropriate choice for the cutoff radius @xmath230 is then dictated by the requirement that the expectation value @xmath232\\,\\phi_{l_i , m_i}({\\bf r } ) \\label{cii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] reproduces the pz - sic - lsda correction of the corresponding orbital in the free atom to within a small tolerance .",
    "simultaneously , the cutoff should be reasonably short so as not to change the connectivity of the matrix elements of the pao hamiltonian . therefore",
    ", in practice , we set the cutoff radius for the projection orbitals @xmath229 on a given atom to be either equal to the largest among the cutoff radii of the pao basis set for that particular atom ( typically the first @xmath233 of the lowest angular momentum ) , or , if shorter , the radius at which @xmath234  0.1mry . for typical cutoff radii ( 6 to 9 bohr ) , we find that the atomic sic - lsda eigenvalues are reproduced to within 1 to 5 mry for the most extended shells and to within 0.1 mry for more confined shells .",
    "thus @xmath235 are rather well converged already for cutoff radii defined by pao energies shifts @xcite of around 20mry .    using the orbitals @xmath229 and the projectors @xmath228 , the occupation numbers @xmath236 and the effective si energies @xmath237 for the extended system can be calculated .",
    "different choices are possible for the projection operators that yield the occupation numbers @xmath236 . in our implementation",
    "we use the so called _ dual _ projection operator given by @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the dual orbital of @xmath240 and is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the sum is over the siesta basis functions @xmath58,@xmath244 and @xmath257 is the density matrix given by @xmath258 +",
