    "for many years the scalar mesons have caused controversy .",
    "there is little consensus on the composition of many states , whilst for some their properties and even existence is a matter for debate . in the latest edition of the pdg tables",
    "@xcite , there are four scalar - isoscalars below 1.55  gev , with a fifth at 1.7  gev .",
    "this is obviously too many for a standard @xmath1 nonet .",
    "however , many qcd - motivated models predict the existence of non-@xmath7 mesons , such as @xmath2 states  @xcite , @xmath8 molecules  @xcite and glueballs  @xcite , and it is precisely in the isoscalar sector that these unconventional mesons are most likely to be found .",
    "this excess of isoscalars , together with the existence of two isovectors , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 , has been suggested as evidence for two scalar nonets  @xcite : the conventional @xmath1 nonet lying around 1.4  gev with an unconventional one centred around 1  gev .",
    "however , the pdg lists only one pair of scalar - isospinors in this mass region , the @xmath3 .",
    "this has led some authors to postulate a light strange meson , known as the @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "evidence for this resonance has been claimed within certain models  @xcite , whilst other studies dispute this  @xcite .",
    "fits to @xmath5 production data , using breit - wigner forms , some with arbitrarily varied backgrounds , others with theoretically motivated backgrounds , allow a @xmath6 to be accommodated .",
    "however , the existence of a state is not a matter merely of the quality of fit to data along the real energy axis .",
    "indeed , a state is wholly specified by there being a pole of the @xmath11matrix in the complex energy plane on the nearby unphysical sheet .",
    "such specification , of course , does require experimental information in the relevant region of the real energy axis .",
    "where this light strange meson has a mass around 900  mev , it comes within the energy domain testable with the highest statistics results on @xmath12 scattering , which come from the lass experiment  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a close to model independent determination of the number and position of poles in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 scattering amplitude based on these lass data above 825  mev .",
    "the technique relies wholly on the analytic properties of @xmath11matrix elements and requires no artificial separation into resonance and background contributions",
    ". we also consider continuations using results from an earlier slac experiment  @xcite . in sect .  2 , we present the method and then in sect .  3 describe the experimental inputs we use . in sect .  4",
    ", we apply the analytic continuation methodology first to model data to assess its capabilities and limitations . in sect .  5 , we go on to study the analytic continuation using the real experimental results .",
    "we find there is no @xmath4 .",
    "since the method is one of continuing experimental data and the lass experiment only provides information above 825  mev we can not rule out the possibility of an even lower mass @xmath6 . in sect .",
    "6 , we conclude .",
    "the method we use is due to nogov _ et al . _",
    "it combines simple statistics with the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude to locate the positions of poles . as usual",
    ", we expect resonances to correspond to poles on unphysical sheets  @xcite .      in order to locate poles in the complex plane from scattering data on partial wave amplitudes along the real axis",
    ", we must perform an analytic continuation . to maximise the domain in which this continuation is valid , we begin by conformally mapping the partial wave amplitude into the unit disc . as shown in fig .",
    "[ scut ] , for @xmath5 scattering the @xmath15plane is split into two regions and in this case we map the region _ outside _ the circular cut .",
    "the mapping is designed so that the cuts of the partial wave amplitude in the @xmath15plane are mapped onto the circumference of the circle in the @xmath16plane .",
    "this allows us to continue the amplitude throughout the complex @xmath16plane .",
    "partial wave amplitude , where and the radius of the circular cut is .[scut],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    ' '' ''    the mapping is accomplished in two steps .",
    "firstly , @xmath17    which maps the real cuts in the @xmath15plane onto the positive real axis of the @xmath18plane and the circular cut onto the negative real axis . then to map the twice cut @xmath18plane into the unit disc , we define @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a real parameter which is chosen so that the region of interest in the @xmath15plane is mapped close to the imaginary axis in the @xmath16plane , thereby minimising the distance the continuation must cover .",
    "the points @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fixed for any value of @xmath20 , being mapped to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "notice that the cuts in the upper half of the @xmath15plane ( such as the region where physical data lie ) are mapped to the upper semi - circle in fig .",
    "[ zcut ] .",
    "it is obvious from this mapping that the physical region in the @xmath15plane only covers a fraction of the circle .",
    "even if we had data over an infinite range of energies , we could never complete the circle , see fig .",
    "[ zcut ] . nevertheless , we only need analytically continue very close to the region of data ( i.e. the solid arc in fig .  [ zcut ] ) .",
    "we shall return to this point later .",
    "is chosen so that is mapped to the imaginary axis .",
    "the thicker line shows the arc covered by the lass data .",
    "the inset shows an enlargement of the key region close to @xmath25 , from where we analytically continue .",
    "the symbols mark particular values of @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 .",
    "[ zcut],width=453 ]    ' '' ''    from fig .",
    "[ zcut ] we can see that the mapping is highly non - linear in the following sense .",
    "as we increase the energy from threshold to infinity , the proportion of the circle covered by each increment falls very sharply .",
    "it is clear that the region between threshold ( at 633  mev ) and the start of the data ( at 825  mev ) covers a much longer arc than the region in which we have data ( 825  mev to 2.51  gev ) and the region between the end of the data and infinite energy is much smaller still .",
    "this compression of the high energy region would suggest that the method is less sensitive to higher mass resonances .",
    "this apparent weakness actually has some benefit .",
    "as we explain in the next section , we test the scattering amplitude against the hypothesis that it contains a given number of poles .",
    "the computational burden increases rapidly as we increase the number of poles , so if we had to account for all the possible radial excitations in a given channel the calculation would soon become computationally prohibitive .",
    "consequently , the procedure is only practicable for the lowest few states .",
    "= 6.37 mm      for now we assume that we have a scattering amplitude , with errors , @xmath28 , , defined at discrete points all the way around our circle @xmath29 .",
    "we define @xmath30 as the average distance between the @xmath31th data point and its two nearest neighbours in the complex @xmath16plane shown in fig .",
    "[ zcut ] . in regions where these discrete points are densely packed , our scattering amplitude is most tightly controlled and so we weight the error on each point by the density of the data points in that region , @xmath32 .",
    "we make a smooth interpolation to the amplitude , @xmath33 , and the weighted errors , @xmath34 , so that we have continuous functions defined on the entire circle .",
    "this weighting procedure ensures that the small region of the unit circle in fig .",
    "[ zcut ] , where we have experimental data , controls the analytic continuation into the nearby region where resonance poles are expected to sit .",
    "if @xmath35 is a square integrable function on the circle , @xmath36 , then we can test how well this function describes the data through a @xmath37 , defined by @xmath38    we now introduce a non - zero weight function @xmath39 , which is defined to be real analytic and constrained by @xmath40 around the circle .",
    "we expand the data and the trial function as laurent series about the origin , so that @xmath41    since partial wave amplitudes are real analytic , the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are real .",
    "although we are expanding about the origin , the expansion is carried out round the circle , since this is where we have data .",
    "the singular laurent coefficients will pick up any poles within the disc . substituting eq .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) .    if we want to test against the assumption that there are no poles in the data we must use a test function that is analytic , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "then , if the amplitude has no poles , the quantity @xmath46 will be zero",
    ". will not be exactly zero , but should fit a @xmath37 distribution with @xmath47 degrees of freedom . ] if we think that the scattering data has one pair of complex conjugate poles in the @xmath16plane ( as is the case where there is one resonance present ) then we can write our test function as @xmath48}{z^k}\\ , +",

    "however , in practice @xmath53 is close to one and the above procedure becomes unreliable .",
    "consequently , we adopt the alternative approach of cancelling any pole in the data explicitly by the introduction of the so - called blaschke pole - killing factor .",
    "this avoids the need to make the expansion explicit in eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) and so significantly improves the convergence . for a pair of complex conjugate poles the blaschke factor",
    "looks like @xmath54    we define the function @xmath55    and then the quantity @xmath56 will indeed obey a @xmath37 distribution with @xmath47 degrees of freedom , if the actual amplitude contains one pair of complex conjugate poles .",
    "our experimental information on the @xmath11wave @xmath5 partial wave amplitude comes in the form of the magnitudes , @xmath57 , and phases , @xmath58 , measured , for instance , by the lass experiment .",
    "the partial wave amplitude on sheet i is normalised thus @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the c.m .",
    "3-momentum @xmath62[s-(m_k - m_{\\pi})^2]}{s}}\\quad . \\label{mom}\\ ] ]    @xmath5 scattering has two possible isospin channels , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the resonances we consider are isodoublets , as there are no known resonances in the @xmath64 channel .",
    "this means that there is no need to separate the isospin components to determine the pole positions , whereas this is essential in a breit - wigner - type fit .",
    "we therefore carry out our analysis for the total @xmath11wave data .",
    "however , as a check we also perform this for the @xmath63 results alone .",
    "of course , the @xmath63 data must be extracted from the total @xmath11wave data by subtracting an assumed form for the @xmath64 amplitude , thereby introducing an additional layer of uncertainty . moreover",
    ", this separation is only possible over a limited energy range .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath63 component does provide a valuable check .    as is well - known",
    ", resonance poles do not appear on the physical sheet in the energy plane .",
    "consequently , we must move to the relevant unphysical sheet . for purely elastic scattering",
    "this would be sheet ii .",
    "in practice for @xmath5 scattering , the @xmath65 channel opens very weakly ( in agreement with @xmath66 expectations ) and so any inelasticity can be safely neglected , until one reaches the @xmath67 threshold .",
    "this channel opens in the region of a possible @xmath68 and complicates the sheet structure .",
    "any resonance would then be on sheet iii , where the @xmath69 are the signs of the imaginary parts of the complex phase spaces @xmath70 in particular channels .",
    "@xmath71 for @xmath5 , @xmath72 for @xmath67 .",
    "sheet i is @xmath73 , sheet ii is @xmath74 and sheet iii is @xmath75 .",
    "we must take this threshold into account when we change sheets .",
    "the simplest way to pick the correct sheet is to change the sign of the phase , i.e. @xmath76    this moves us onto sheet ii below the @xmath67 threshold and sheet iii above it .",
    "this method of changing sheets is also valid for the total @xmath11wave amplitude .",
    "we then map the data , including errors , as described above .    as noted",
    "previously it is not possible to cover the circle completely with physical region data , since we do not have experimental results either close to threshold or on the circular and left hand cuts ( see fig .",
    "[ scut ] ) .",
    "the exact proportion of the circle covered by the direct channel @xmath12 results depends on the choice of the mapping parameter @xmath20 . how we treat the near threshold arc of fig .",
    "[ zcut ] is a little different for our model tests of sect .",
    "4 and when we consider the actual experimental data in sect .  5 .",
    "consequently , we detail their treatment in the appropriate section . as we do not have information about what happens on the unphysical cuts , we simply make a guess .",
    "so that the guess does not unduly affect the results , we de - weight these guessed points by giving them very large errors and by ensuring that they are widely spaced ( see fig .",
    "[ data ] ) . with the top semi - circle now spanned by data points",
    ", we make an interpolation to give us a continuous function .",
    "we complete the circle by reflecting the interpolated data in the upper semi - circle onto the lower half so as to obey the schwarz reflection principle .    a suitable form for the weight function @xmath39 , which fulfills all the conditions described above is @xmath77    where the @xmath78 are found from a fourier cosine fit to @xmath79 .",
    "we take @xmath80 .",
    "the singular coefficients of the laurent expansion of the data about the origin are just @xmath81",
    "as a first application , the method described in sect .  3 is tested on a model amplitude describing the situation where a light , broad resonance , @xmath82 , and a heavier , narrower resonance , @xmath83 , are present .",
    "the resonances are constructed using jost functions , with the lighter , broader resonance being treated as the background at the second resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 on the first sheet , where @xmath85    the four parameters @xmath86 are chosen , so that the amplitude has poles at and .",
    "data are created for energies equivalent to the full lass data - set  @xcite , with the error on both the magnitude and phase fixed at 5% . below the energy of the lass data",
    ", we create a few equally spaced points between threshold and and 825  mev .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "the amplitude in the unphysical region is set to a real constant ( incidentally equal to the amplitude at threshold ) with very large errors ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "these model data are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ data ] .     as a function of @xmath88 , the angular position around the circle in degrees , for the model data - set .",

    "[ data],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    ' '' ''",
    "these model data allowed us to verify that the blaschke factor method is indeed more stable to variations of non - physical parameters ( such as the number of terms in our definitions of the @xmath37 and the weight function ) and hence more accurate . the pole positions and @xmath37 s found by fitting over the first 40 singular coefficients using this procedure are shown in table  [ tjr ] .",
    "also tabulated for comparison are the results obtained when the errors on the points in the unphysical region are halved .",

    "these data extend closer to threshold , so it is only necessary to create a point at threshold .",
    "barrelet ambiguities lead to four possible partial - wave solutions , which differ only above 1500  mev , so the choice of solution should not affect our conclusions regarding the @xmath6 .",
    "we have carried out our analysis using solutions a and b and found the results to be qualitatively similar and so we show only those for solution  b. the data are shown below 1  gev in fig .",
    "[ esta ] , which should be compared with the low energy treatment of the lass data - set ( see fig .",
    "[ lowdata ] ) .",
    "this new _ case a _ is defined using an effective range formula , see eq . [ er ] , with @xmath89  gev@xmath90 and @xmath91  gev@xmath90 .",
    "no resonance was assumed in this fit , so any lingering doubts that assuming the tail of the @xmath68 in the low energy extrapolation introduces a prejudice is clearly not there in this case .",
    "we also consider _ case b _ using the scattering length predictions of @xmath92pt , as before .",
    "the results for the estabrooks _ et al . _",
    "data - set  @xcite are shown in table  [ ter ] .",
    "for the real @xmath5 experimental results , tables  [ tlslr][ter ] display a consistency in identifying a single resonance which looks very like the @xmath68 .",
    "the fall in @xmath37 in going from no resonance to one resonance is always sizeable , ranging from a factor of 35 to a factor of 290 .",
    "in contrast when going from one to two resonances , the @xmath37 does not always fall by a significant amount .",
    "recall importantly that the present analysis technique is always most sensitive to the lightest resonance and this is clearly the @xmath68 .",
    "so whilst the @xmath3 is overwhelmingly apparent , a lighter , broad resonance in the lass range above 825  mev is not .",
    "when using the lass data and _ case b _ , where the low energy behaviour is given by @xmath92pt , there is a sizeable decrease in @xmath37 for two resonances , but the very light and broad one is below the experimental ranges studied by both lass and estabrooks _ at al._.    halving the errors in the unphysical region should not greatly affect the pole positions obtained , and from table  [ tjr ] we can see that this is indeed the case . from tables  [ tlslr][ter ] we see that for the assumption that there is only one resonance present , then halving the unphysical errors or changing the near threshold continuation , has a small effect .",
    "however , when we force the amplitude to have two resonances the effect is much more noticeable . generally , the resonance which looks like @xmath68 tends to stay in a similar position , but the second one moves around wildly .",
    "this is what one would expect if this second resonance is merely an artifact of forcing the method to find two poles that are not really present in the energy range of the data that are being analytically continued into the complex plane .",
    "we mentioned earlier that we would expect the method to be less sensitive to high mass resonances .",
    "this is borne out by these results .",
    "the lass group provide strong evidence for a state at 1.95  gev . with data to 2.51  gev",
    "we would expect to see this state showing up , but the compression of the high energy portion of the amplitude has diluted the effect of the @xmath93 so much that it is not needed to describe the data in the complex @xmath16plane .",
    "this is to be expected from our study using model data , described in sect .",
    "the mapping procedure severely limits our ability to find states above 1800  mev in @xmath5 scattering .",
    "however , below that , and particularly down towards the lower end of the experimental range , the method is totally reliable and quite unambiguous . consequently , we have no doubt that    * there is a @xmath3 , * there is no @xmath4 ,    in experimental @xmath5 scattering data .",
    "we have here applied a method of analytic continuation in as model independent way as is presently possible to the existing data on @xmath94 scattering between 825  mev and 2.5  gev .",
    "we find that there is only one scalar resonance between 825 and 1800  mev , which is readily identified with the @xmath3 .",
    "our procedure requires no assumptions about the amplitude being described by breit - wigner forms with any particular form of background .",
    "it directly counts the number of poles of the @xmath11matrix on the nearby unphysical sheet .",
    "this method provides a rigorous test of whether the @xmath4 exists , and we conclude it does not .",
    "this is so whether we use the older estabrooks _ et al . _  @xcite data or that of the lass collaboration  @xcite",
    "clearly , the question of the existence of a @xmath6 of mass and width that does not intrude into the energy range explored by experiment can not be addressed .",
    "the fact that there is only one strange scalar between 800 and 1800  mev has implications for quark models that postulate both a @xmath1 and a @xmath2 nonet in this region  @xcite .",
    "our results of course do not depend on this modelling .",
    "however , we can not refrain from commenting that we believe that other calculations clearly show the scalars are different from other states with underlying @xmath1 composition .",
    "their decay modes , overwhelmingly to two mesons , mean that the physical hadrons do have a large @xmath2 component in their fock space  @xcite .",
    "thus for many purposes the scalars below 1800  mev ( particularly those with flavour ) do behave like 4quark states , even though they may well be seeded by single @xmath1 pairs at the bare level",
    ". however , such calculations and speculations are for elsewhere .",
    "we conclude that the data on @xmath11wave @xmath5 scattering exhibit just one pair of complex conjugate poles between 0.8 and 1.8  gev .",
    "this means that there is only one resonance present in this channel in the region accessed by the presently highest statistics experiment .",
    "this resonance has a mass around 1400  mev and a width of about 300  mev .",
    "the @xmath4 does not exist .",
