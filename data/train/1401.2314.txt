    "in this paper , we discuss the optimal hedging strategy based on the mean - variance criterion for the fund and insurance managers in the presence of incompleteness as well as imperfect information in the market .",
    "if an unhedgeable risk - factor exists , the fund and insurance managers are forced to work in the physical measure and resort to a certain optimization technique to decide their trading strategies . in the physical measure , however , they soon encounter the problem of _ imperfect information _ which is usually hidden in the traditional risk - neutral world .",
    "one of the most important factors in the financial optimizations is the drift term in the price process of a financial security .",
    "in fact , many of the financial decisions consist of taking a careful balance between the expected return , i.e. drift , and the size of risk .",
    "however , the observation of a drift term is always associated with a noise , and we need to adopt some statistical inference method . in a large number of existing works on the mean - variance hedging problem , which usually adopt the _ duality method _ , pham ( 2001 )  @xcite , for example , studied the problem in this _ partially observable drift _ context . in spite of a great amount of literature  ,",
    "results with explicit solutions which can be directly implementable by practitioners have been quite rare thus far . when the explicit forms are available , they usually require various simplifying assumptions on the dependence structure among the underlying securities and their risk - premium processes , and also on the form of the hedging target , which make the motivations somewhat obscure from a practical point of view .",
    "a new approach was proposed by mania & tevzadze ( 2003 )  @xcite , where the authors studied a minimization problem for a convex cost function and showed that the optimal value function follows a backward stochastic partial differential equation ( bspde ) .",
    "they were able to decompose it into three backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) when the cost function has a quadratic form .",
    "although the relevant equations are quite complicated , their approach allows a systematic derivation for a generic setup in such a way that it can be linked directly to the dynamic programming approach yielding hjb equation . in fujii & takahashi ( 2013 )  @xcite , we have studied their bsdes to solve the mean - variance hedging problem with partially observable drifts . in the setup",
    "where kalman - bucy filtering scheme is applicable , we have shown that a set of simple ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and the standard monte carlo simulation are enough to implement the optimal strategy .",
    "we have also derived its approximate analytical expression by an asymptotic expansion method , with which we were able to simulate the distribution of the hedging error .",
    "the problem of imperfect information is not only about the drifts of securities .",
    "fund and insurance managers have to deal with stochastic investment flows from their clients .",
    "in particular , the timings of buy / sell orders are unpredictable and their intensities can be only statistically inferred . the same is true for loan portfolios and possibly their securitized products .",
    "it is , in fact , a well - known story in the us market that the prepayments of residential mortgages have a big impact on the residential mortgage - backed security ( rmbs ) price , which in turn induces significant hedging demand on interest rate swaps and swaptions .",
    "see @xcite , for example , as a recent practical review on the real estate finance .    in this paper",
    ", we extend @xcite to incorporate the stochastic investment flows with _ partially observable intensities _  . in the first half of the paper , where we introduce two counting processes to describe the in- and outflow of the investment units , we provide the mathematical preparations necessary for the filtering procedures .",
    "then , we explain the solution technique for the relevant bsdes in detail , which gives the optimal hedging strategy by means of a set of simple odes and the standard monte carlo simulation . in the latter half of the paper , we further extend the framework so that we can deal with a portfolio of insurance products .",
    "we provide a method to differentiate the effects on the demand for insurance after the insured events based on their loss severities . furthermore",
    ", we explain how to utilize jackson s network that is often adopted to describe a network of computers in the queueing analysis .",
    "we show that it is quite useful for the modeling of a general network of investment flows , such as the one arising from a group of funds within which investors can switch a fund to invest",
    ".    although we are primarily interested in providing a flexible framework for the portfolio management , the presented framework may be applicable to manufacturers and energy firms operating multiple lines of production .",
    "for example , they can use it to install an efficient overlay of dynamic hedging by financial derivatives , such as commodity and energy futures , in order to minimize the stochastic production as well as storage costs .",
