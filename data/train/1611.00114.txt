    "_ throughout the paper , unless otherwise specified @xmath3 is a kac  moody algebra over @xmath4 with triangular decomposition @xmath5 and weyl group @xmath6 , and @xmath0 is a @xmath3-module of highest weight @xmath7 .",
    "_    in this paper we study and answer several fundamental convexity - theoretic questions related to the weights of @xmath0 and their convex hull , denoted @xmath8 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches in the literature , our approach is to use techniques from representation theory to directly study @xmath8 and deduce consequences for @xmath2 .    to describe our results and the necessary background , first suppose @xmath3 is of finite type and @xmath0 is integrable . in this case , @xmath2 is a convex polytope , called the weyl polytope , and is well understood . in particular , the faces of such weyl polytopes have been determined by vinberg @xcite and casselman @xcite , and as casselman notes , are implicit in the earlier work of satake @xcite and borel ",
    "tits @xcite .",
    "the faces are constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 index the simple roots of @xmath3 , and @xmath10 the chevalley generators of @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath11 , denote by @xmath12 the corresponding levi subalgebra generated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "also define the following distinguished set of weights : @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the highest weight space .",
    "the aforementioned authors showed that every face of the weyl polytope for @xmath0 is a weyl group translate of the convex hull of @xmath17 for some @xmath11 .    to complete the classification of faces",
    ", it remains to determine the redundancies in the above description .",
    "formally , consider the _ face map _ : @xmath18    where @xmath19 denotes the power set of a set @xmath20 .",
    "as @xmath17 and its convex hull determine one another , computing the redundancies is the same as computing the fibers of the face map .",
    "the determination of the fibers for the restriction @xmath21 is implicit in the above works of vinberg and casselman .",
    "a complete understanding of the fibers of @xmath22 was achieved very recently by cellini ",
    "marietti @xcite for the adjoint representation , and subsequently , by khare @xcite for all highest weight modules .",
    "while the fibers of the face map were understood for all highest weight modules @xmath0 , it was not known whether all faces were of the above form .    in this paper",
    "we resolve both parts of the above problem for any highest weight module @xmath0 over a kac  moody algebra @xmath3 .",
    "while the answer takes a similar form to the known cases in finite type , the proof of the first part requires a substantially different argument , as prior methods fail at several crucial junctures :    a.   a key input in the known cases of the classification of faces of @xmath2 was that every face is the maximizer of a linear functional , which was deduced from polyhedrality .",
    "however , even the polyhedrality of @xmath2 was not known in general in finite type .",
    "b.   we show in related work @xcite that indeed @xmath2 is always a polyhedron in finite type .",
    "however as we show below , for @xmath3 of infinite type , @xmath2 is rarely polyhedral , generically locally polyhedral , and in some cases not locally polyhedral .",
    "in particular , one can not _ a priori _ appeal to a maximizing functional to understand a face .",
    "c.   finally , even given a face cut out by a maximizing functional , the possibility of the functional to fall outside the tits cone makes the usual analysis inapplicable .",
    "in this paper we provide an infinitesimal analysis of the faces that avoids invocation of functionals , completing the first part of the classification of faces . as a consequence ,",
    "every face is _ a posteriori _ cut out by a maximizing functional lying in the tits cone . for the second part ,",
    "i.e.  computing the redundancies , we give a direct representation theoretic argument which in particular simplifies the existing arguments in finite type .",
    "moreover , we construct a remarkable convex cone , which we call the universal weyl polyhedron @xmath23 , whose combinatorial isomorphism class controls the convex hulls of weights of all highest weight modules which are parabolically induced from a fixed levi .",
    "namely , ( i ) the classification of faces of @xmath23 is equivalent to that of all such highest weight modules , and ( ii ) inclusions of faces of @xmath23 control how faces of such highest weight modules degenerate as the highest weight specializes .",
    "let @xmath3 be a kac  moody algebra and @xmath0 a highest weight @xmath3-module .",
    "we now state the first part of the classification of faces of @xmath2 .",
    "[ ffffaces ] denote by @xmath24 the _ integrability _ of @xmath0 , i.e. : @xmath25    for each standard levi subalgebra @xmath26 , the locus @xmath27 is a face of @xmath2 . these account for every face of @xmath2 which contains an interior point in the @xmath24 dominant chamber .",
    "an arbitrary face @xmath28 of @xmath2 is in the @xmath29 orbit of a unique such face .    for @xmath3 of finite type ,",
    "this classification was obtained by satake @xcite , borel ",
    "tits @xcite , vinberg @xcite , and casselman @xcite for @xmath0 finite - dimensional , and by khare @xcite for many infinite - dimensional modules .",
    "theorem [ ffffaces ] settles the remaining cases in finite type , and is to our knowledge new in infinite type .",
    "as explained above , a proof in this setting requires new ideas .",
    "interestingly , our proof , which proceeds by induction on the rank of @xmath3 , uses the consideration of non - integrable modules in an essential way , even for the case of integrable modules .",
    "the classification of inclusion relations between faces , akin to the one in finite type @xcite , is our next main result . by theorem [ ffffaces ] , it suffices to study the fibers of the face map @xmath30 , defined as in .    [ tinclusions ] for each @xmath11 there exist sets @xmath31 such that : @xmath32    in particular , in the poset @xmath33 under inclusion , the fibers of the face map @xmath21 are intervals",
    ". moreover , the fibers of @xmath34 are left cosets of @xmath35 in @xmath29 .",
    "given the final assertion of theorem [ ffffaces ] , this determines the fibers of the map @xmath22 .",
    "explicit formulas for @xmath36 are presented before theorem [ incl ] and after remark [ rremark ] , respectively . in particular",
    ", we determine the @xmath37-polynomial of @xmath2 , cf .",
    "proposition [ ffpoly ] .",
    "thus , theorems [ ffffaces ] and [ tinclusions ] together settle the classification problem for faces of arbitrary highest weight modules , over all kac  moody algebras .",
    "modulo the action of the weyl group , theorems [ ffffaces ] and [ tinclusions ] are essentially statements about the actions of the standard levi subalgebras on the highest weight line . in this light",
    ", they admit a natural extension to quantum groups , which we prove in section [ squantum ] .",
    "as shown below , the sets @xmath36 , and therefore the combinatorial isomorphism class of @xmath2 , only depend on @xmath38 through @xmath39 .",
    "motivated by this , we study deformations of the convex hulls @xmath2 for highest weight modules with fixed integrability .",
    "to interpolate between such convex hulls , we fix @xmath11 , and consider _ weyl polyhedra _ , which are simply convex combinations of the convex hulls of highest weight modules with integrability @xmath40 .",
    "we study a natural notion of a _ family _ of weyl polyhedra over a convex base @xmath20 , and show that such families admit a classifying space .",
    "[ trep ] consider the contravariant functor @xmath41 from convex sets to sets , which takes a convex set to all families of weyl polyhedra over it , and morphisms to pullbacks of families .",
    "then @xmath41 is representable .",
    "if @xmath42 represents @xmath41 , we obtain a universal family of weyl polyhedra @xmath43 .",
    "concretely , one may take @xmath42 to be a parabolic analogue of the dominant chamber , so that @xmath43 extends the usual parametrization of modules by their highest weight .",
    "we study the convex geometry of the total space @xmath23 , and show a tight connection between its combinatorial isomorphism type and the previous results on the classification of faces .",
    "[ tuniversal ] for @xmath11 as above , @xmath23 is a convex cone .",
    "write @xmath44 for the set of faces of @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath44 can be partitioned : @xmath45 so that each @xmath46 , ordered by inclusion , is isomorphic to the face poset of @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is any highest weight module with integrability @xmath40 and highest weight @xmath38 with @xmath47 .",
    "we in fact show more than is stated in theorem [ tuniversal ] : the remaining inclusions of faces are determined by how faces of @xmath2 degenerate as the highest weight specializes , cf .",
    "proposition [ ezpz ] .",
    "in particular , we determine the @xmath37-polynomial of @xmath23 , cf .",
    "proposition [ pfpoly ] .",
    "we are unaware of a precursor to theorem [ tuniversal ] or its aforementioned strengthening in the literature .",
    "theorem [ tuniversal ] is proved by using the projection to @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , along the interior of each face of @xmath42 , the restriction of @xmath23 is a ` fibration ' , and we use this to construct faces of @xmath23 from ` constant ' families of faces along the fibres .    finally , we explain a question of michel brion on localization of faces , which we answer in this paper .    to do so",
    ", we introduce a notion of localization in convex geometry .",
    "if @xmath48 is a real vector space , and @xmath49 a convex subset , then for @xmath50 to study the ` germ ' of @xmath51 near @xmath52 one may form the tangent cone @xmath53 , given by all rays @xmath54 such that for @xmath55 . given a face @xmath28 of @xmath51 , one can similarly form the ` germ ' of @xmath51 along @xmath28 , by setting @xmath56 to be the intersection of the tangent cones @xmath57",
    ". it may be helpful to think of tangent cones as convex analogues of tangent spaces and @xmath56 a convex analogue of the normal bundle of a submanifold .",
    "let @xmath3 be of finite type , @xmath38 a regular dominant integral weight , and @xmath58 the corresponding simple highest weight module .",
    "brion observed that for any face @xmath28 of @xmath59 , @xmath60 is always the convex hull of a parabolic verma module for a category @xmath61 corresponding to the triangular decomposition @xmath62 for some @xmath63 . further , if @xmath64 , then one could take @xmath65 .",
    "brion asked whether this phenomenon persists for a general highest weight module @xmath0 .",
    "in answering brion s question we will prove the equivalence of several convexity - theoretic properties of the convex hull of a highest weight module , which we feel is of independent interest .",
    "in particular , the following result explains the subtlety in classifying faces of @xmath2 for @xmath3 of infinite type , as alluded to in the introduction .",
    "[ clo ] let @xmath3 be indecomposable of infinite type and @xmath0 a highest weight @xmath3-module",
    ". then @xmath2 is a polytope if and only if @xmath0 is one - dimensional , and is otherwise a polyhedron if and only if @xmath24 corresponds to a dynkin diagram of finite type .",
    "if @xmath0 is not one - dimensional , the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the intersection of @xmath2 with any polytope is a polytope .",
    "2 .   the tangent cone @xmath66 is closed , and @xmath67 .",
    "3 .   @xmath2 is closed .",
    "@xmath38 lies in the interior of the @xmath24 tits cone .    in the somewhat unrepresentative case of integrable modules in finite type , theorem [ clo ]",
    "is straightforward and well known , see e.g.  @xcite . for general @xmath68 and @xmath0 ,",
    "one of the implications can be deduced from work of looijenga on root systems @xcite , and a theorem concerning local polyhedrality in a similar geometric context appears in his later work @xcite .",
    "otherwise , to our knowledge theorem [ clo ] is largely new , including for all non - integrable modules in finite type .",
    "returning to brion s question , given theorem [ ffffaces ] it suffices to consider faces of the form @xmath27 .",
    "we show :    [ brcc ] suppose @xmath38 has trivial stabilizer in @xmath29 , and @xmath11 .",
    "writing @xmath28 for the face @xmath27 , we have : @xmath69    the regularity assumption appearing in theorem [ brcc ] specializes to that of brion for integrable modules in finite type .",
    "that such a condition is necessary to recover from @xmath2 the convex hull of a module with less integrability is already clear from considering edges , i.e.  the case of @xmath70 .    in brion s motivating example , this convexity - theoretic localization is a combinatorial shadow of localizing the corresponding line bundle on the flag variety off of certain schubert divisors . as we develop in @xcite , for general @xmath0 with dot - regular highest weight in finite type ,",
    "the above formula is the combinatorial shadow of localizing the corresponding ( twisted ) @xmath71-module on the flag variety .      after discussing preliminaries and establishing notation in section [ snotation ] ,",
