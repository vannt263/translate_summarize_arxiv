    "the theoretical determination of ion distributions in aqueous solutions was initiated almost a century ago by guoy @xcite and chapman @xcite , who applied the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory to calculate the spatial distribution of monovalent ions near a uniformly charged interface .",
    "ever since their seminal work , the topic remains central in statistical mechanics , physical chemistry , and biophysics@xcite .",
    "the original pb theory is a mean field theory with some simplified assumptions such as , point like particles and uniform surface charge density . to account for the finite ionic radius , stern introduced phenomenologically a layer of ions at the charged interface with a different dielectric constant , the stern layer @xcite .",
    "the effect of excess salt concentration and the resulting screening was extended by debye - hckel @xcite .",
    "grahame generalized the gouy - chapman theory to multivalent ions @xcite .",
    "subsequently , more refined theories and numerical simulations were developed to incorporate short - range interactions , image charges , finite size ionic radius , and ion - ion correlations @xcite .",
    "more recently , modifications of pb theory have been developed to incorporate hydration forces @xcite .",
    "some first - principles calculations of surface - tension for amphiphilic monolayers assume a pb theory with one or more layers of varying dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "experimental support for the validity of pb theory was provided by electrokinetic , visco - electric effects , and other techniques ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "mclaughlin and collaborators @xcite have shown good agreement between @xmath4-potentials computed from pb theories and electrophoretic measurements in lipid vesicles .",
    "other techniques , such as radiotracer experiments @xcite , x - ray reflectivity @xcite , or infrared spectroscopy @xcite allow the determination of the total amount of ions in the immediate vicinity of a charged interface .",
    "it is noteworthy that all the experimental data for monovalent ions ( at moderate salt concentrations @xmath5 0.1 m ) outlined above are adequately described by the guoy - chapman theory ( with the generalization of excess salt ) with no need for further corrections @xcite .",
    "a close inspection , however , shows the agreement between theory and experiment is either based on fitting variables such as surface charge or interfacial dielectric values , that are not known in advance or / and based on integrated quantities . as an example , it has been shown recently that the degree of proton dissociation of arachidic acid spread on a sodium salt solution is adequately described by pb theory , but this agreement only involves the integral ( over the entire space ) of the sodium distribution @xcite .",
    "thus , local deviations that preserve the integral of the distribution ( i.e. , total number of ions ) are not discriminated by these experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "force measurements between two charged membranes separated by salt solutions , although well described by pb theory at large distances , show strong deviations at short distances ( 1 - 2 nm)@xcite .",
    "the origin of these hydration forces is still controversial . in some cases",
    ", it has been suggested to extend pb theory to incorporate the restructuring of water , resulting in ion distributions that deviate from pb at short distances from the interface @xcite .",
    "it is therefore imperative to determine the ion distribution itself to establish the degree of accuracy of pb theory .    in this manuscript",
    ", we experimentally determine the distribution of cs@xmath3 ions next to charged interfaces by anomalous x - ray reflectivity @xcite for several decades in bulk cesium concentrations .",
    "we compare our results with the predictions of pb theory and present a discussion on the sensitivity of the experimental results to quantify the magnitude of possible deviations from the pb distribution .",
    "this kind of investigation has become feasible only with the advent of the second generation x - ray synchrotron sources with novel insertion devices ( i.e. undulator ) and improved optics , which readily produce variable - energy x - ray beams with brilliances capable of detecting a single atomic - layer even if not closely packed .",

    "we conclude that pb with the renormalization of surface charge density due to proton - transfer and release processes ( rpb ) is strikingly accurate .",

    "our results show that theoretical effects that are usually suggested to modify pb theory , such as finite ion - size , in - plane modulations of surface charge density , hydration forces , short - range interactions , the roughness of the surface or image charges are not necessary to describe the experimental data .",
    "this is not to be understood as implying that such effects are not present , but rather that their significance is entirely limited to a characteristic spatial distance of the order of @xmath84 4 or less . as for claims based on the modification of pb by hydration forces",

    "although the experimental counter - ion distributions are well described within the rpb theory , we point out that the reflectivity and gixd hint at water restructuring at the interface . future theoretical or numerical work may clarify this issue .",
    "a recent report analyzing the accuracy of pb near charged liquid - liquid interfaces by the use of x - ray surface sensitive techniques shows that ion distributions are well described by pb at concentrations of 10 mm , but marked deviations are found at higher concentrations ( of the order 100 mm ) , where ion - ion correlations have to be included in the theoretical analysis.@xcite we did not perform anomalous reflectivity for concentrations above 10 mm , so we are not able to provide ionic distributions for these concentrations .",

    "<S> surface sensitive synchrotron x - ray scattering studies were performed to obtain the distribution of monovalent ions next to a highly charged interface . </S>",
    "<S> a lipid phosphate ( dihexadecyl hydrogen - phosphate ) was spread as a monolayer at the air - water interface to control surface charge density . using anomalous reflectivity off and at the @xmath0 cs@xmath1 resonance , </S>",
    "<S> we provide spatial counterion ( cs@xmath1 ) distributions next to the negatively charged interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> five decades in bulk concentrations are investigated , demonstrating that the interfacial distribution is strongly dependent on bulk concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this is due to the strong binding constant of hydronium h@xmath2o@xmath1 to the phosphate group , leading to proton transfer back to the phosphate group and to a reduced surface charge . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of cs@xmath3 concentration modifies the contact value potential , thereby causing proton release . </S>",
    "<S> this process effectively modifies surface charge density and enables exploration of ion distributions as a function of effective surface charge - density . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally obtained ion distributions are compared to distributions calculated by poisson - boltzmann theory accounting for the variation of surface charge density due to proton release and binding . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the accuracy of our experimental results in discriminating among possible deviations from poisson - boltzmann theory . </S>"
