    "the recent observation of the cosmic microwave background by _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) suggests that the reionization of the universe took place at redshifts of @xmath4 ( spergel et al .",

    "2003 ; page et al . 2006 ; spergel , d. , et al .",
    "this result implies that first generation stars ( pop iii stars ) were possibly born at @xmath5 if uv photons emitted from pop iii stars are responsible for cosmic reionization . however , there is no direct evidence that pop iii stars actually formed at @xmath6 . obviously , it is impossible with current or near future facilities to detect the emission from a pop iii star at such high redshifts ( e.g. , mizusawa et al . 2004 ) .",
    "but , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) can be detected even at @xmath6 , if they arise there .",
    "grbs are the only currently available tool for probing first generation objects in the universe .",
    "if one uses the data of absolute magnitude for grbs with known redshifts , one can expect that more than half grbs are detectable if they occur at @xmath6 ( lamb @xmath7 reichart 2000 ) .",
    "roughly 3000 grbs have been detected to date , but redshifts have been measured only for 30 grbs ( bloom et al .",
    "2003 ) , among which the most distant is grb  000131 at @xmath8 ( andersen et al .",
    "but , if empirical relations between the spectral properties and the absolute magnitude are used , the grbs detected to date may include events at @xmath9 ( lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "2002 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "2004 ; murakami et al .",
    "in addition , recently a new grb satellite , _ swift _ , has been launched ( gehrels et al .",
    "_ swift _ is now accumulating more data of grbs at a high rate .",
    "recently , grb  050904 detected by _",
    "swift _ , in terms of metal absorption lines and lyman break , turns out to have occurred at @xmath10 ( kawai et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the discovery of the association between grb  030329 and sn  2003dh has demonstrated that at least a portion of long bursts in grbs are caused by collapse of massive stars ( kawabata et al . 2003 ; price et al . 2003 ; uemura et al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "pop iii stars are expected to form in a top - heavy fashion with the peak at @xmath11 in the initial mass function ( imf ) ( e.g. , nakamura & umemura 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "also , the theoretical study by heger & woosley ( 2002 ) suggests that pop iii stars between @xmath12 and @xmath13 may end their lives as grbs accompanied by the core collapse into black holes .",
    "heger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate , assuming the imf by nakamura & umemura ( 2001 ) , that 5% of pop iii stars can result in grbs . in the context of cold dark matter cosmology ,",
    "more than 10 - 30% of grbs are expected to occur at @xmath5 , assuming that the redshift distributions of grbs trace the cosmic star formation history ( bromm & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "thus , observed grbs highly probably contain grb originating from pop iii stars at @xmath5 .",
    "the firm methods to measure redshifts are the detection of absorption and/or emission lines of host galaxies of grbs ( e.g. , metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , or the ly@xmath14 absorption edge in afterglow ( andersen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , these methods can not be applied for all grbs , but have been successful to determine redshifts only for 30 grbs ( bloom et al .",
    "2003 ) . instead",
    ", some empirical laws have been applied to much more grbs .",
    "they include a variability - luminosity relation ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) , a lag - luminosity relation ( norris et al .",
    "2000 ) , @xmath15-luminosity relation ( amati et al . 2002 ) , and the spectral peak energy - to - luminosity relation ( yonetoku et al .",
    "applying these relations to grbs , the redshift distributions of grbs are derived ( fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ; norris et al . 2000 ; schaefer et al 2001 ; lloyd - ronning et al . 2002 ; yonetoku et al .",
    "some analyses conclude that a portion of grbs are located at @xmath5 . however , it is still controversial whether such an indirect technique is correct or not .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel method to constrain the redshifts of grbs that may originate from pop iii stars at @xmath5 .",
    "in the present method , the effects of the gravitational lensing by pop iii stars are considered .",
    "the lensing of grbs is considered for the first time by paczyski ( 1986 , 1987 ) , who proposed the possibility that a soft gamma - ray repeater is produced by gravitational lensing of a single burst at cosmological distance .",
    "also , loeb & perna ( 1998 ) first discussed the microlensing effect of grb afterglows , and garnavich ; loeb & stanek ( 2000 ) found the candidate microlensed afterglow ( grb  000301c ) .",
    "the rates of such events are further discussed from theoretical points of view ( koopmans & wambsganss 2001 ; wyithe & turner 2002 ; baltz & hui 2005 ) .",
    "blaes & webster ( 1992 ) argue the method to detect cosmological clumped dark matter by using the probability of detectable grb lensing .",
    "nemiroff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and marani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) search for the compact dark matter candidate using actual grbs data obtained by the burst and transient source experiment ( _ batse _ ) satellite on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ satellite .",
    "they focus on large mass lenses up to @xmath16 , which cause the delay time - scale of several tens-100 s. on the other hand , williams & wijers ( 1997 ) investigate the influence on grb light curve of the millisecond gravitational lensing caused by each star in a lensing galaxy .",
    "in addition , nemiroff & marani ( 1998 ) argue that it is possible to place constraints on the cosmic density of dark matter , baryons , stars , and so on , by microlensing by stellar mass objects . in the present method ,",
    "we focus on the gravitational lensing by pop iii stars .",
    "if the mass of pop iii stars is on the order of @xmath0 and the redshift is greater than 10 , the time delay between two lensed images of a grb is @xmath1 s. quite advantageously , this time delay is longer than the time resolution ( 64 ms ) of grb light curves and shorter than the duration of grb events , which is several tens to 100 sec for long bursts .",
    "thus , we can see the superimposed light curves of two lensed images .",
    "the present method seeks for the imprint of gravitational lensing by pop iii stars in grb light curves .",
    "we attempt to extract the imprint of lensing by calculating the autocorrelation of light curves .    in this paper , we assume a standard @xmath17cdm cosmological parameter : @xmath18 km @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 , the formalism of gravitational lensing and the estimation of time delay between two images are provided . in  3 , the method to find the evidence of lensing by pop iii stars is proposed .",
    "also , we demonstrate the potentiality of the present method for artificially lensed grbs , and describe how to determine the redshifts of lensed grbs . in  4 , we apply this method to 1821 grb data obtained by _ batse _ , and find a candidate of lensed grb .",
    " 5 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we consider a grb lensed by a foreground pop iii star . here",
    ", we presuppose the lens model of a point mass .",
    "the einstein ring radius gives a typical scale of gravitational lensing , which is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravity constant , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 is the mass of a lens object , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are respectively angular diameter distances between the lens and the source , the observer and the source , and the observer and the lens .",
    "a point mass lens produces two images with angular directions of @xmath31 \\label{eq : theta } , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the angle of lens from a line - of - sight to the source .",
    "we hereafter express the image with @xmath33 by image 1 , and that with @xmath34 by image 2 .",
    "the brightness of the image 1 and the image 2 are respectively magnified by @xmath35 , \\label{eq : mag}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 . thus , the image 1 is brighter than the original one , while the image 2 is fainter . in the case of a lens of pop iii star ,",
    "the einstein radius is estimated as @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , this angular separation is impossible to resolve by current facilities .",
    "hence , we can just observe the superposition of two images .",
    "however , the light curves of two images are superimposed with a time delay caused by the gravitational lensing , as shown in figure [ fig : image_of_lensed_lc ] .",
    "the arrival time of signals for a lensed image is expressed as @xmath39 \\label{eq : delay } , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the redshift of lens object , and @xmath41 is so called lens potential . for the point mass lens model , @xmath41 is expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is constant ( narayan & bartelmann 1997 ) .",
    "then , the time delay between two images is given by @xmath44 it should be noted that @xmath45 is determined solely by the mass and redshift of lens , regardless of the source redshift . in other words ,",
    "the time delay places a constraint just on the lens , not on the source .",
    "however , if the lens redshift ( @xmath40 ) is determined , it gives the minimum value of the source redshift ( @xmath46 ) since @xmath46 must be higher than @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : delay_amp ] illustrates the relation between the time delay @xmath45 and the magnification ratio between image 1 and image 2 , assuming the lens redshift of 50 .",
    "this figure shows that the lens with @xmath47 yields the time delay longer than the standard grb duration , if the typical delay time - scale is assessed by @xmath48 .",
    "( note that , as shown later , if @xmath49 becomes larger than unity , the ratio of magnification becomes smaller and therefore the contribution of image 2 becomes difficult to extract .",
    "also , if @xmath49 becomes smaller than unity , the probability of lensing goes down . ) on the other hand , the lens with @xmath50 leads to @xmath45 shorter than the time resolution of light curves , and therefore the information of delay is buried .",
    "the mass scale of @xmath0 expected for pop iii stars gives @xmath51 , which is longer than the time resolution and shorter than the grb duration .",
    "hence , this mass range appears to be suitable for extracting the time delay information .",
    "however , the actual grb light curves generally exhibit variabilities with time - scale shorter than @xmath45 .",
    "thus , it is not straightforward to extract the time delay information . to demonstrate this difficulty",
    ", we show the light curve of grb  930214 and the artificially lensed light curve in figure [ fig : art_lens ] , where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are assumed .",
    "the time delay is @xmath55 s in this case .",
    "this figure clearly shows that if we observe only the superimposed lensed light curve , it seems impossible to recognize by appearance that this light curve is lensed .",
    "hence , we invoke a new technique to discriminate a lensed grb from unlensed one .",
    "we pay attention to the fact that all spikes in a light curve are individually lensed .",
    "then , many pairs with time separation of @xmath45 appear in the light curve , as schematically shown in figure [ fig : correaltion ] ( b ) . to detect those pairs",
    ", we employ the autocorrelation method ( e.g. , geiger & schneider 1996 ) .",
    "the autocorrelation , @xmath56 , is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the number of photons contained in a _",
    "i_-th bin in the grb light curve .",
    "if there are pairs with @xmath45 , the autocorrelation ( [ eq : corre ] ) is expected to show the resonance `` bump '' around @xmath45 , as shown in figure [ fig : correaltion ] ( c ) .",
    "then , we can evaluate the time delay by the existence of this bump .",
    "the autocorrelation method is simple and well defined , but the issue we should check is its applicability for the actual grb light curves . to test the robustness of this method ,",
    "we produce artificially lensed light curves for grbs in _ batse _ archived data , and calculate the autocorrelation .",
    "we use 1821 light curves in the _ batse _ catalogue with the time resolution of 64 ms . ]",
    "unless otherwise specified , we adopt the data of @xmath59 , where @xmath59 is defined by the duration such that the cumulative photon counts increase from 5% to 95% of the total grb photon counts ( kouveliotou et .",
    "1993 , koshut et . al . 1996 ) .",
    "then , the summation in equation ( [ eq : corre ] ) is taken in the range of @xmath60 .",

    "@xmath56 for the artificially lensed light curve is fit by the polynomial of 8th degree . with using the best fit polynomial @xmath63",

    "the levels of @xmath67 are shown by dashed lines .",
    "the zoomed view around the bump of @xmath56 for the artificially lensed light curve is also shown in each small panel .",
    "for these grbs , bumps exceeding @xmath68 appear if lensed , corresponding to the time delay between two lensed images , @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , not all grb light curves exhibit bumps in @xmath56 when lensed .",

    "the probability turns out to be @xmath91 for @xmath92 . if we take into account that more than 10 - 30% of grbs occur at @xmath5 ( bromm & loeb 2002 )",

    "a part of the recalculated @xmath56 are shown in figure [ fig : re_corre ] .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that a bump in the correlation arises as a result of pure statistical fluctuations .      as a further test for the lensing of grb  940919 light curve",
    ", we attempt to decompose the light curve , assuming that it is the superposition of two lensed light curves with @xmath94 s , and analyze the decomposed light curves .",

    "hence , we can conclude that the light curve of grb  940919 is successfully decomposed and is likely to be the superposition of two lensed light curves .      here",

    "if the lens is pop iii stars with @xmath0 at @xmath9 , the time delay between two lensed images of a grb is @xmath1 s. this time delay is longer than the time resolution ( 64 ms ) of grb light curves and shorter than the duration of grb events .",
    "therefore , if a grb is lensed , we observe the superposition of two lensed light curves .",
    "we have considered the autocorrelation method to extract the imprint of gravitational lensing by pop iii stars in the grb light curves . using _ batse _",

    "furthermore , in 1821 grb light curves , we have found one candidate of grb lensed by a pop iii star at @xmath93 .",
    "the present method is quite straightforward and therefore provides an effective tool to search for pop iii stars at redshift greater than 10 .",

    "<S> we propose a novel method to extract the imprint of gravitational lensing by pop iii stars in the light curves of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> significant portions of grbs can originate in hypernovae of pop iii stars and be gravitationally lensed by foreground pop iii stars or their remnants . </S>",
    "<S> if the lens mass is on the order of @xmath0 and the lens redshift is greater than 10 , the time delay between two lensed images of a grb is @xmath1s and the image separation is @xmath2as . </S>",
    "<S> although it is difficult to resolve the two lensed images spatially with current facilities , the light curves of two images are superimposed with a delay of @xmath1 s. grb light curves usually exhibit noticeable variability , where each spike is less than 1s . </S>",
    "<S> if a grb is lensed , all spikes are superimposed with the same time delay . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if the autocorrelation of light curve with changing time interval is calculated , it should show the resonance at the time delay of lensed images . applying this autocorrelation method to grb light curves which are archived as the _ batse _ catalogue , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that more than half of the light curves can show the recognizable resonance , if they are lensed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in 1821 grbs we actually find one candidate of grb lensed by a pop iii star , which may be located at redshift @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the present method is quite straightforward and therefore provides an effective tool to search for pop iii stars at redshift greater than 10 . using this method , we may find more candidates of grbs lensed by pop iii stars in the data by the _ swift _ satellite . </S>"
