    "astrophysical jets are ubiquitous , as they are associated with many classes of astrophysical objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agn e.g. , m87 ) , young stellar objects ( yso e.g. , hh 30 , hh 34 ) , x - ray binaries ( ss433 , cyg x-3 , grs 1915 + 105 , gro 1655 - 40 ) etc .",
    "however , only jets around x - ray binaries like grs1915 + 105 @xcite and agn like 3c273 , 3c345 @xcite , m87 @xcite etc are relativistic . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on relativistic jets .",
    "since it is conjectured that stellar mass black hole reside at the heart of microquasars and those of the super - massive variety dictates the dynamics of the agns / quasars , therefore it implies that a jet has to originate from the accreting matter itself , since black holes ( hereafter , bh ) have neither hard surface nor any atmosphere .",
    "interestingly , simultaneous radio and x - ray observations of microquasars show a very strong correlation between the spectral states of the accretion disc and the associated jet states @xcite , which reaffirms the fact that jets do originate from the accretion disc . in addition",
    ", recent observations have shown that jets originate from a region which is less than 100 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath1 ) around the unresolved central object @xcite , which imply that the entire disc may not participate in production of jets , but only the central region of the disc is responsible .",
    "since jets are supposed to originate very close to the central object , the plasma at the base should be hot and is expected to be fully ionized .",
    "this hot outflowing plasma will also be in the intense radiation field from the accretion disc .",
    "a number of scientists have studied the interaction of radiation with jets .",
    "@xcite ignored radiation drag and investigated particle and gas flow in the radiation field of an underlying keplerian disc @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the interaction of the particle jets with the radiation field , in the funnel like region of a thick accretion disc @xcite .",
    "ignoring gravity and for normal electron - proton or @xmath2 plasma jets , the authors achieved a terminal speed of around @xmath3 , and obtained terminal lorentz factor @xmath4 for electron - positron or , @xmath5 plasma . in a seminal paper",
    ", @xcite showed that for particle jets above an infinite keplerian disc , the radiation drag ensures an upper limit of terminal speed , which the author termed it as ` magic speed ' and which turned out to be @xmath6 .",
    "the much ` vaunted ' magic speed is actually the so - called equilibrium speed of jet plowing through a radiation field near the keplerian disc surface .",
    "it may be noted that , equilibrium speed ( @xmath7 ) is the speed of the jet at which the radiation force becomes zero and for speeds above which , radiative deceleration sets in .",
    "equilibrium speed arises due to the presence of the radiation drag .",
    "radiation drag is significant for a radiation field due to an extended source . on the other hand , terminal speed ( @xmath8 ) is the speed of the jet at which the total force on the jet approaches zero .",
    "therefore , the jet may achieve @xmath8 only at large distances away from the central object , while it may reach @xmath7 at distances much closer to the central object . @xcite",
    "considered jets which are accelerated to ultra - relativistic speed way above the local @xmath7 .",
    "this causes the radiation drag to become effective and decelerate the jet to terminal velocity @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite concluded that for the disc they chose , the maximum possible of lorentz factor is @xmath10 .",
    "the japanese group led by jun fukue made very important contribution to the research of transonic outflows , both in the relativistic , as well as , in non - relativistic domain .",
    "@xcite extended icke s work , and studied particle jets away from the axis , although like icke , considered near disc approximation for the radiation field above it .",
    "the actual terminal jet velocity achieved was @xmath11 , which is expected .",
    "however , the main problem is the tendency of the radiation field to spin up the jet and thereby spreading the jet .",
    "@xcite then studied jets confined by disc corona in order to arrest the spreading and collimate the jet .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , computed the radiation field due to a keplerian disc governed by newtonian gravity , schwarzschild gravity and kerr gravity .",
    "the strength of the radiation field above the disc , described by schwarzschild gravity is @xmath12 lesser than that due to newtonian gravity .",
    "but the strength of the radiation field above a disc governed by a kerr type gravity is @xmath0 times higher than that due to the newtonian gravity , making radiatively driven jets easier to blow for a rotating black hole . in a very interesting paper ,",
    "@xcite considered a hybrid disc , consisting of outer keplerian disc and inner advection dominated accretion flow or adaf @xcite type accretion solutions .",
    "since adaf is dimmer , so the inner region from which the electron - positron jet is assumed to emerge in this paper , does not contribute in the radiation field .",
    "such a scenario do produce jets with terminal lorentz factor @xmath13 , and the radiation field from the outer keplerian disc also helps in collimation .",
    "along with the various disc models like keplerian disc , thick disc , adaf , investigations on advective discs was initiated by @xcite .",
    "such a disc can admit smooth solutions , and for the right choice of parameters it may harbour shock transition .",
    "this disc model was extended by considering injection of a mixture of matter with keplerian angular momentum and sub - keplerian angular momentum .",
    "the portion of disc which is termed as sub - keplerian disc ( skd ) , sandwiches the keplerian disc ( kd ) from the top and the bottom ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . skd may undergo shock transition and at the shock , kd terminates due to extra heating in the post - shock disc or psd @xcite .",
    "although it was initially proposed as an elaborate and contrived model solution , but was recently confirmed by numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "interaction of radiations with the outflowing jet from psd was studied by @xcite .",
    "the investigation of outflowing jet @xcite was further elaborated for the radiation field of the chakrabarti - titarchuk type hybrid disc @xcite .",
    "generally most of the papers which investigate the interaction of jet with disc photons do not consider the issue of the launch mechanism of jets in terms of the accretion properties . in the advective disc regime",
    ", numerical simulations first showed that the extra - thermal gradient force in the psd automatically generates bipolar outflows @xcite . theoretically too , for a viscous advective disc , the mass outflow rate of bipolar outflow was computed in terms of various accretion disc parameters @xcite .",
    "however , jets emerging from the psd in the steady state and hydrodynamic limit are weak . on the other hand , if the emanating jets are simultaneously acted on by disc photons , then the jets obtained are stronger @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown by @xcite , that as the advective disc spectral state moves from low - hard or lh state to intermediate states or i m , the steady jet becomes stronger , as has been reported in observations @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xcite not only generated jets from accretion solutions , but also accelerated the jets by depositing momentum of disc photons on to the jet .",
    "however , the formalism followed by @xcite is only correct up to the first order of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the flow velocity . so solving the jet equations in the relativistic hydrodynamic limit",
    "is warranted for chakrabarti - titarchuk type disc .",
    "the equations of motion of radiation hydrodynamics were developed by many authors @xcite .",
    "it was observed that in the non - relativistic limit , only flux of the radiation pushes matter . in the relativistic limit and optically thin plasma ,",
    "the moving plasma is pushed by the flux and is dragged by the energy density and pressure of the radiation field .",
    "the radiation transfers momentum on to the electrons and therefore , the radiative acceleration term is proportional to the number density of electrons / positrons in the jet , which is true in relativistic , as well as , non - relativistic limit .",
    "but in relativistic limit , the radiative acceleration term is also proportional to the inverse of the enthalpy of the flow , which marks a major difference between relativistic and non - relativistic domain .",
    "therefore , although @xcite showed radiatively driven jets qualitatively explain the correlation between jet states and the spectral state of the accretion discs , but a correct relativistic narrative is required .",
    "if however , one considers the gas pressure ( @xmath16 ) to be negligible compared to the radiation pressure ( @xmath17 ) , then even in the fully relativistic limit , the net radiative term is only proportional to the number density of the flow .",
    "therefore , the physics of interaction of disc radiation with a fluid jet in the relativistic regime is qualitatively and quantitatively different than that between radiation and jet in the non - relativistic domain @xcite , or relativistic jets in the domain where @xmath18 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate this phenomenon in details .",
    "@xcite studied interaction of fluid jets with the disc radiation but the jet fluid was described by fixed adiabatic index @xmath19 and newtonian gravitational potential .",
    "however , fixed @xmath19 is an artifact of non - relativistic kinetic theory , if the internal random motions of the particles in the fluid is relativistic , then @xmath19 is a function of temperature @xcite , where , for relativistic temperatures , the flow is described by @xmath20 and for non - relativistic temperatures @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite showed that it is unphysical to consider a fixed @xmath19 to describe fluid with several orders of magnitude variation in temperature .",
    "moreover , it has also been shown that , not only temperature , relativistic nature of the thermal energy depends also on the composition of the flow @xcite .",
    "infact it was shown that , contrary to expectation , pair - plasma is thermally the least relativistic , and to make a flow more relativistic one needs baryons in addition to electrons or positrons , and the fluid with proton number density around @xmath22 of that of electrons is thermally the most relativistic .",
    "now radiation force is imparted mainly onto the electrons and positrons which should make the lighter jet to move faster due to inertia , as is shown for cold jets @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the thermodynamics of the jet will make the fluid with @xmath22 proton content to be more relativistic .",
    "so in presence of radiation driving , would a jet with protons less than @xmath22 be more accelerated , or , the thermal nature of the flow dictate the dynamics .",
    "additionally for fluid jets , the pressure gradient force should accelerate the jet , while gravity decelerate , and radiative force depends on the fluid speed in addition to the radiative moments . at the base ,",
    "the jet is supposed to be hot , so initially , can the jet be thermally driven to speeds above @xmath7 , and therefore , is mostly decelerated by radiation and not accelerated at all ? in short , can disc radiation power jets to relativistic terminal speeds ?",
    "these are few of the various issues we would like to investigate in this paper . in this paper",
    "the accretion disc plays an auxiliary role , we do not employ a self consistent calculation of accretion - ejection system , rather the jet is assumed to originate in the inner disc , which in our case is psd , and the accretion disc just provides the radiation field which interacts with the jet .",
    "while doing so , we have not increased the number of accretion disc parameters , and the shock location is estimated from the skd accretion rate , and psd luminosity has been estimated from the accretion rates from skd and kd .    in the next section , we present the simplifying assumptions and various equations . in section [ sbsec2.1 ] , we present the governing equations of the jet . in section [ sbsec2.2 ] , we present the model of accretion disc , estimation of the disc intensity from various disc components ( section [ sbsbsec2.2.1 ] ) , and computation of the radiative moments ( section [ sbsbsec2.2.2 ] ) from the disc intensities .",
    "disc intensities , the disc velocity and temperature profiles are estimated in appendix [ app : accvt ] .",
    "the post - shock intensity is estimated in appendix [ app : mdotxs ] . in section [ sec3 ] , we present the solution methodology and in section [ sec4 ] , we present the results and in the last section ( [ sec5 ] ) we discuss the physical implications of the obtained results and draw concluding remarks .",
    "coordinates ) . the keplerian disc ( kd ) , sub - keplerian disc ( skd ) , and the post - shock disc ( psd ) are broadly the three regions of the disc .",
    "the shock location @xmath23 , the intercept of skd on the axis ( @xmath24 ) , height of the shock @xmath25 are shown , the outer edge of the disc @xmath26 are all marked .",
    "semi - vertical angle of psd is @xmath27 and for skd it is @xmath28 .",
    "the gradient of colour represents low temperature ( red ) to high temperature ( blue).,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.5 cm",
    "the space time metric is given by ds^2=-c^2dt^2+dr^2+r^2d^2+dz^2 where , @xmath29 are the time , radial , azimuthal and the axial coordinates . the jet is considered to be in steady state ( @xmath30 ) . the above is a special relativistic metric . although the jets originate close to the central compact object , but it traverses to distances where the effect of gravity is negligible .",
    "hence pseudo potential is used to take care of gravity in the equations of motion , such that at close ranges the gravity limits the outward thrust , and at large distances it is just special relativistic regime , therefore one may avoid general relativistic complications and still be accurate enough . moreover",
    ", the jets are collimated , so we consider on - axis ( @xmath31 ) and axis - symmetric ( @xmath32 ) jet . without any loss of generality , the jet is assumed to expand radially along the @xmath33-axis , the value of any jet variable on any particular point of the axis , is assumed to be maintained along its breadth at the same @xmath33 . in the present effort",
    ", we just assume that there are jets from an accretion disc , but do not compute jets self consistently from accretion solution .",
    "the accretion disc is present but plays a supportive role , by supplying the radiation which drives the jet . in the next subsection we present the equations of motion .",

    "needless to say depending upon initial condition and disc radiation field , the jet geometry may depart from the simple geometry we are following in this paper . even then",
    ", our assumption is not completely outlandish .",
    "the funnel like surface of the psd is the region from where the jet is supposed to originate , the shape itself will arrest the lateral spread of the outflowing matter .",
    "moreover , such shape causes the @xmath69 component of radiative flux directed towards the axis @xcite which would also reduce the lateral spreading even with high jet - base temperature .",
    "however , one can justify our assumption only if we solve the jet equations since we need some estimate of the pressure . in appendix ( [ app : jgeom ] ) , we estimated the pressure gradient term along with the radiative term along @xmath69 and compared them , the assumption of conical jet cross - section seems to hold .",
    "the physics of the jet propagating in the radiation field of the accretion disc can be understood , if equations ( [ mom.eq]-[mdotout.eq ] ) are simultaneously solved .",

    "the jet plasma is fully ionized .",
    "therefore the interaction with photons would be dominated by scattering .",
    "therefore , the energy equation ( [ econ.eq ] ) has no source term because in the scattering regime and in absence of emission / absorption , the r. h. s is zero and the flow is isentropic @xcite . under such conditions , equation ( [ econ.eq ] ) along with equation ( [ eos.eq ] ) can be integrated to obtain the relativistic isentropic equation of state , @xmath83 where , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the constant of entropy . we replace @xmath51 from the above equation on to equation ( [ mdotout.eq ] ) , we get the expression for entropy - accretion rate , @xmath89 this is also a measure of entropy of the jet and remains constant along the jet .",

    "if the first term @xmath99 dominates , then radiation would accelerate the flow , which means the net radiative term would either be accelerating or decelerating depending on the velocity .",
    "the dependence of radiative term on @xmath15 arises purely due to relativity . in the purely non - relativistic domain @xmath100 ,",
    "the radiative term is just @xmath101 . in the fast but sub relativistic domain",
    "@xmath102 the radiative term is @xmath103 similar to the formalism followed by @xcite .",

    "of course the resultant acceleration depends on the magnitude of all moments .",
    "there is an added feature of radiatively driven relativistic fluid , the radiative term is multiplied by a term inverse of enthalpy ( @xmath109 ) of the flow , which actually suggests that the effect of radiation on the jet is less for hotter flow .",

    "we used some known accretion disc solutions from the literature @xcite , to obtain a simplifying analytic relation between the shock location and the skd accretion rate ( appendix b ) .",

    "and then we studied the propagation of a transonic and relativistic jet through this radiation field .",
    "we noticed that proper relativistic transformation of the radiative intensities from the local disc frame to the observer frame is very important and these transformations modify the magnitude , as well as , the distribution of the moments around a compact object .",
    "the psd and skd are the major contributors in the net radiative moments and kd contribution is much lower than either one of the former two .",
    "however , the contribution of psd compared to that of skd in the net moment , will depend on where the shock forms which is also dictated by the accretion rate .",
    "one of the interesting fact about the moments due to various disc components is that they peak at different positions away from the disc plane .",
    "therefore the jet which is initially thermally driven , but is further accelerated by the radiative moments from various disc components further down stream .",
    "the jets with normal conditions at the base , produces mildly relativistic jets with terminal velocities @xmath386 few @xmath387 ( fig .",
    "[ lab : gen ] ) .",
    "the scattering regime maintains the isentropic nature of the jet , and because we considered a realistic and relativistic gas equation of state , the adiabatic index changes along the jet .",
    "however , radiation not only accelerates but also decelerates if @xmath388 .",
    "although close to the jet base ( @xmath275 ) the velocity is low and the radiation field should accelerate , but being hot the effect of radiation is not significant in the subsonic branch because of the presence of inverse of enthalpy term in the radiative term @xmath314 of the equation of motion ( equation [ dvdr.eq ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the subsonic domain the jet is accelerated as a result of competition between thermal and the gravity term . in the supersonic domain",
    "the gravity term is smaller than both the thermal and the radiative term . if @xmath389 and @xmath390 , then the jet can be decelerated ( figs .",
    "[ lab : terms]a , b ) .",
    "as the magnetic pressure is increased , the synchrotron radiation from skd increases and it jacks up the flow velocity in the supersonic regime . increasing the @xmath239 increases both the synchrotron , as well as , bremsstrahlung photons from the skd , which makes the skd contribution to the net radiative moment more dominant , and therefore increases the @xmath15 in the supersonic part of the flow .",
    "the @xmath8 increases with @xmath130 but tends to taper off as @xmath391 , however , @xmath8 tends to increase with @xmath239 and shows no tendency to taper off .",
    "the jet tends to get faster with the decrease in protons ( decrease of @xmath351 ) .",
    "we do not extend our study to electron and positron or @xmath79 jet , since a purely electron - positron jet is highly unlikely @xcite , although pair dominated jet ( @xmath392 ) is definitely possible .",
    "so we extend our study to @xmath393 jets ( fig .",
    "[ lab : parameters]a - f ) .",
    "although the terminal velocity @xmath8 increases with the total luminosity @xmath365 , and approaches relativistic values as the disc luminosity approaches the eddington limit .",
    "however , the kd plays a limited role in accelerating jets ( figs . [ lab : lumkd ] a , b ) . since the radiation field around a super - massive bh and stellar mass bh is different , we compared jets starting with the same base values , same accretion rates ( in units of @xmath212 ) but around stellar mass and super - massive bh",
    ". if accretion rates are moderately high , then jets around super - massive bhs are slightly faster than those around stellar mass bh ( figs .",
    "[ lab : m1m8]a , b ) .",
    "however , if accretion accretion rates are high such that the moments from the central region of the disc differ significantly , then ultra - relativistic jets around super massive bhs can be obtained compared to stellar mass bh ( figs .",
    "[ lab : m1m8]c , d ) . for high accretion rates",
    ", it has been shown that around stellar mass bh , moments due to psd and the pre - shock disc are comparable , which makes @xmath394 for a larger distance away from the bh ( fig . [ lab : r3 ] ) .",
    "this limits the maximum velocity a jet may achieve around a stellar mass bh , compared to that around a super - massive bh .",
    "this brings us to the issue of maximum possible terminal velocity of the jet .",
    "we launched jets with relativistic sound speed in order to get maximum thermal driving , while increase the accretion rates to very high values .",
    "the comparison of jet @xmath380 around a stellar mass bh and that around super massive one as a function of @xmath351 , shows that jet around super massive bh can be accelerated to @xmath395 even for fluid composition @xmath2 , while that around stellar mass bh @xmath396 few .",
    "however , lighter jets around @xmath250 bh can be accelerated to truly ultra - relativistic speeds , compared to jets around stellar mass bh .",
    "it is interesting that the radiative moments from different disc components maximize at different distances from the jet base , which opens up the possibility of multi stage acceleration of the jet .",
    "however , close to the base , thermal acceleration is the main driving force that makes the flow supersonic , and thereby negating the effect of gravity .",
    "thereafter , the radiative driving accelerates jet to mildly relativistic terminal velocities if the radiation field is mild , but intense radiation field can accelerate jets to ultra - relativistic velocities . hence , the thermal driving of the jet at the base , along with the radiative driving further out , comprises a complete multi - stage acceleration rather than just the radiation field itself . although the maximum terminal speeds achieved is truly ultra - relativistic , especially around super - massive bhs , but at the jet base , which is hot , the disc photons may take away energy from the hot electrons instead of imparting its momentum onto it . the jet base may also radiate via other processes .",
    "these radiations would , in the observer frame , actually be flowing along the jet and therefore may interact and deposit momentum on to the jet further down stream .",
    "the jet may also gain energy via free - free absorption .",
    "these aspects have been ignored and therefore the conclusions might slightly differ .",
    "however , it is clear the jet can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speed .",
    "we would like to simulate the present work of radiation driven relativistic jets around compact objects , similar to our effort with galactic outflows @xcite .",
    "one of the major difference expected is , if the radiative states of the accretion disc changes , how does it affect the jet and what are the timescales in which these changes are expected to be observed in the jets .",
    "these advances of our work are underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
