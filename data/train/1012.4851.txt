    "the evaluation of the velocity matrix can also be performed analytically .",
    "because of their local character , the mlwfs serve as a kind of exact tight - binding basis of minimal sizes . however , in practice , it is not always easy to generate highly localized wannier functions for metallic systems , and systems with complex band structures .",

    "all the calculations performed in this paper are based on the density functional theory ( dft ) within local ( spin ) density approximation [ l(s)da ] .",
    "although our method is demonstrated for the norm - conserving @xcite pseudopotentials , in principle , it should also work well for the ultrasoft or paw pseudopotentials .",
    "monkhorst - pack @xmath0 points @xcite are used in the following calculation .",
    "the details of how to construct systematically optimized atomic basis for _ ab initio _ calculations have been given in ref . .",
    "here we give a brief review of our earlier approach to generating local orbitals .",
    "the atomic orbitals are written as radial functions times spherical harmonic functions , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the radial function is taken as the linear combination of spherical bessel functions within certain range @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the element type , the index of atom of each element type , the multiplicity of the radial functions , the angular momentum and the magnetic quantum number , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the spherical bessel function , where @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10=0 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are chosen to minimize the `` spillage '' , @xcite @xmath12 between the hilbert space spanned by the atomic orbitals and the plane wave calculations , for selected reference states . in eq .",
    "[ eq : spillage ] , @xmath13 is the eigenstate of plane wave calculations , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number of states of interest and the number of k - points in the brillouin zone .",
    "@xmath16 is a projector spanned by the atomic orbitals , i.e. , @xmath17 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is atomic orbitals .",
    "@xmath20 is the atom center of the @xmath21-th orbital , and @xmath22 is the lattice vector .",
    "@xmath23 is the overlap matrix element .",
    "the minimization of the spillage is achieved by using a simulated annealing method . because the orbitals generated from this step usually have unphysical oscillations , an additional step is added to smooth out the orbitals by minimizing the kinetic energy of each orbital.@xcite    we have performed extensive tests of this scheme for a wide variety of systems , including semiconductors , oxides , metals , and clusters , etc .",
    "the results show that the obtained atomic bases are very satisfactory in both accuracy and transferability.@xcite however , to make high accuracy electronic structure interpolation , we need to modify the scheme for the task .    in ref .",
    ", where the aim is to do self - consistent _ ab initio _ calculations in complex chemical environments , to get maximal transferability of the basis sets , a set of dimers with different bond lengths are selected as the reference systems .",
    "the valence states are chosen as the reference states . however , in order to interpolate the electronic structures with extremely high accuracy for a particular system , the system itself is used as the reference system . in many cases ,",
    "the interested states lie only in a given energy window ( i.e. , valence bands as well as conduction bands ) , therefore , we can choose these states ( instead of all the valence bands ) as the references states .    in the self - consistent lcao calculations , which are usually applied to deal with extremely large systems ,",
    "it is important to keep the basis size compact .",
    "often used basis are dzp ( double zeta orbitals plus a polar orbital ) etc .",
    "the small basis set is not enough for high accuracy electronic structure interpolations .",
    "one must use much higher angular momentum and more zeta orbitals . in these cases ,",
    "the cgh scheme has obvious advantages , because it can generate the fully _ optimized _ orbitals with arbitrary angular momentum and any number of radial functions for a given angular momentum .",
    "it has been shown in ref . that increasing the orbital radius cutoff @xmath4 can reduce the spillage value , and therefore improve the quality of the orbitals .",
    "however , a larger @xmath4 also means more computational costs . in the self - consistent calculations , one has to balance the computational costs and the accuracy , and choose a modest @xmath4 . yet , for band structure interpolations , the systems under study are usually considerably smaller , a larger @xmath4 can be used .",
    "once we obtain the atomic orbitals , the electronic structures can be calculated efficiently by using well established lcao methods .",
    "in this section , we show via a few examples how the present band structure interpolation scheme works . we start the tests from simple solid structures like na , si and al . na and al",
    "are metallic while si is a semiconductor .",
    "more complex materials , such as iron based superconductor bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 are then tested .",
    "we further show that the atomic bases have much better transferability than the the bloch bases and wannier bases for the purpose of band structure interpolation .",
    "we take bcc sodium as the first example .",
    "we use energy cut - off @xmath25=50 ry .",
    "a @xmath26 @xmath0-point mesh is used as the reference states to generate the local orbitals .",
    "we choose the lowest 6 bands for interpolation . in order to quantify the quality of the interpolation",
    ", we calculate the root - mean - square errors ( rmse ) between the interpolated bands and the plane wave calculations , defined as , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of the @xmath0 points that the comparison has been taken between @xmath29 the eigenvalue calculated from plane wave basis and @xmath30 the eigenvalue calculated from atomic orbitals .    the rmse of the 6 interpolated bands of na are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_na_al](a ) .",
    "three levels of atomic orbitals are generated and compared . at each level , we use one group of s , p , d , and f orbitals ( 1s1p1d1f ) .",
    "the radius cutoff @xmath4 is chosen as 12 a.u .",
    "we find that the quality of the basis set is much better if all the orbitals of the same level are generated simultaneously than those generated separately . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_na_al](a ) , the rmse of the 1s1p1d1f , 2s2p2f2f and 3s3p3d3f local basis sets are less than 8 mev , 3 mev and 2 mev respectively .     for the basis sets , whose maximal angular momentum are d , f , g , respectively.,width=307 ]    figure  [ fig : na ] illustrates how the angular momentums and radial cutoff affect the interpolation accuracy .",
    "the black lines indicate the spillage values while the red lines indicate the averaged rmse of the 6 bands .",
    "the radius cutoff changes from 6 a.u . to 15 a.u .. the largest angular momentum of the orbitals is set from @xmath31 ( d orbitals ) to @xmath32 ( g orbitals ) .",
    "we use 5 radial orbitals ( zeta functions ) for each angular momentum , which ensures that the accuracy improved by multi - zeta orbitals is converged .",
    "we find consistent change between spillage values and the rmse , confirming that the spillage is a good criterion for the interpolation quality .",
    "the rmse reduce considerably as @xmath4 increases from 6 a.u . to 9 a.u .",
    ", while only small improvement is found when @xmath4 is larger than 9 a.u .. the d orbitals are not sufficient for the high accuracy interpolation , because the corresponding rmse are around 50 to 100 mev even a very large @xmath4 is used . adding in f orbitals improve greatly upon d orbitals .",
    "for example , for @xmath4=10 a.u . , adding f orbitals to the interpolation basis reduces the rmse to 0.86 mev .",
    "the g orbitals improve further upon f orbitals , but not as much as f orbitals to d orbitals . since the spillage can be as small as 10@xmath33",
    ", one can get highly accurate physical properties related to the wave functions .",
    "the interpolation results for si diamond structure and fcc al are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : si_na_al](b)(c ) respectively . for these two materials",
    ", we find g orbitals must be included to get highly accurate interpolation results . for si",
    ", the lowest 8 bands are interpolated .",
    "the 1s1p1d1f1 g orbitals can interpolate the band structures with rmse are about 10 mev for all the bands .",
    "if the basis set is doubled , the rmse for all 8 bands are smaller than 2 mev , showing extremely good accuracy .",
    "when it further increases to the level 3 orbitals , the rmse can be reduced within 1 mev . for al , if the first 1s1p1d1f1 g orbitals are used , the rmse can be reduced to 10 mev . when we double the basis to 2s2p2d2f2 g , and rmse of all the bands fall within 3 mev .",
    "the rmse can be further reduced to less than 1 mev , when 3s3p3d3f3 g orbitals are used , also showing remarkable accuracy .",
    "the black , red , and green columns represent the rmse of level 1 , 2 , 3 atomic basis sets respectively .",
    "( b ) compare the interpolated band structures ( blue lines ) using 3s3p3d3f3 g basis to the plane wave calculations ( red dots ) . ]",
    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in doped iron arsenide has attracted great attention .",
    "@xcite here we show our electronic structure interpolation scheme also works well for materials like bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 which have complex band structures .",
    "we interpolate the 14th to 24th bands , which span about a 6 ev energy window around the fermi level .",
    "figure  [ fig : bafe2as2](a ) depicts the rmse for each band using different numbers of numerical orbitals . when using the 1s1p1d1f1 g orbital ( 25 basis per atom ) , the rmse of all the bands are under 6 mev except for the last one , which is 15.7 mev .",
    "once the second radial functions are used , the rmse of all bands are reduced to below 1.3 mev except the last one which is 2.48 mev . when using the third radial functions , all the rmse are under 0.6 mev except the last one which is 1.23 mev .    figure  [ fig : bafe2as2](b ) depicts the band structures of bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 along the @xmath34z  x@xmath34z line .",
    "the band structures calculated by plane waves are shown in blue dotted line , whereas the band structure calculated by 3s3p3d3f3 g numerical orbitals are plotted in black solid lines .",
    "the interpolated bands and the full _ ab initio _ calculations are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "we also test gaas , fcc cu and cuzn alloys , and the results are all similar to the the examples above . for gaas and fcc cu ,",
    "the rmse are less than 10 mev by using the 1s1p1d1f1 g orbitals ( 25 atomic orbitals per atom ) only .",
    "we find that the 3s3p3d3f orbitals ( 48 orbitals per atom ) can interpolate the 60 bands around fermi level of cuzn alloys with rmse @xmath2 2 mev , which are quite similar to the results given in ref . , in which 42 bases per atom were used to get the same accuracy .",
    "@xcite          sometimes we need to calculate the physical properties under certain perturbations , such as strain , defects , electric field , etc . in these cases , a transferable basis set is highly desirable .",
    "shirley s bloch interpolation does not have any transferbility .",
    "even with a small change of the system ( e.g. , a deformation of the unit cell ) , the bloch basis needs to be regenerated .",
    "it has been shown that wanner functions do not have satisfactory transferbility either , @xcite because they have too many details .",
    "here we demonstrate that the cgh orbitals have very good transferbility for the interpolation purpose .",
    "we take the ( 3,3 ) carbon nanotube ( cnt ) as an example , which is a metallic armchair nanotube .",
    "the system contains 12 atoms .",
    "we interpolate the 20th to 27th bands around the fermi level .",
    "we use the energy cutoff @xmath35=100 ry .",
    "we first generate the interpolation basis for the cnt at its equilibrium structure .",
    "we use s , p , d and f orbitals as the interpolation basis , with the radius cutoff @xmath4=10 a.u .",
    "the rmse are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt](a ) .",
    "the conduction bands are more difficult to interpolate than valence bands , but still for level 2 , 3 , 4 orbitals , the rmse are less than 8 mev , 4 mev and 2 mev respectively .",
    "the interpolated band structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt](d ) in black solid lines compared to the plane wave results shown in the red dotted lines .",
    "the two band structures are hardly distinguishable .    using the _ same _ interpolation basis ,",
    "we calculate the band structures for ( 3,3 ) cnts which are stretched 10% or compressed 10% along the tube and their rmse .",
    "the rmse are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt](b)(c ) , and the corresponding band structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnt](e)(f ) respectively .",
    "as we see , the rmse almost do not change with respect to the cnt stretching and compressing , even though the band structures themselves change dramatically .",
    "these results demonstrate that the cgh orbitals have excellent transferbility for the interpolation purpose , which is very important when perturbation calculations are needed .",
    "we have presented an efficient scheme for accurate electronic structure interpolations based on the systematically improvable optimized atomic orbitals .",
    "the current scheme has several advantages over the existing interpolation schemes .",
    "we find usually 16  25 orbitals per atom can give accuracy about 10 mev compared to the full _ ab initio _ calculations , similar to that of the revised shirley s scheme .",
    "however , unlike the shirley s method , in which a large number of three - dimensional wave functions have to be stored in the calculations , the present scheme only needs to store the one - dimensional radial functions .",
    "the atomic orbitals are highly localized , therefore the scheme has many good features as the interpolation schemes based on maximally localized wannier functions . even though the number of atomic orbitals is greater than that of wannier functions , generally the atomic orbitals are more localized than wannier functions , and therefore have much less neighboring atoms .",
