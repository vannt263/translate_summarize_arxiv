    "the linearized stability of the schwarzschild black hole follows by combination of the regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief decomposition of gravitational perturbations of the schwarzschild metric @xcite and a result by kay and wald @xcite that proves the boundedness of all solutions of the wave equation corresponding to @xmath2-data of compact support .",
    "the proof of the last rests on the positivity of the conserved energy .",
    "the question of the linearized stability of the kerr black hole is still an open problem whose outcome is of major importance to general relativity . in comparison to the case of the schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the solution to this problem is considerably more complicated .",
    "mainly , this is due to two facts .",
    "first , a decomposition comparable to that of regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief does not yet exist in this case , although the recent finding of @xcite gives hope that such a decomposition might exist .",
    "in contrast , a partial decomposition based on the newman - penrose formalism depends on the choice of a tetrad field , i.e. , is gauge dependent even under ` small ' coordinate transformations @xcite .",
    "second , a conserved energy for the solutions of the wave equation exists , but the energy density is negative inside the ergosphere . this fact excludes , at least a direct , application of the so called ` energy methods ' to a proof of stability of the solutions .",
    "the total energy could be finite while the field still might grow exponentially in parts of the spacetime .",
    "but recently a local stability result has been proved that the restrictions of the solutions to compact subsets @xmath3 in space are elements of @xmath4 with a norm converging to zero for @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "because of the absence of a decomposition of the regge - wheeler - zerilli - moncrief type , the question of applicability of the last and similar other results to the question of linearized stability of the kerr metric is still open . as mentioned above , @xcite contains the surprising find of a new symmetry operator that commutes with a normalized in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "for instance , such a ` normalization ' takes place if the klein - gordon equation is solved for the second order time derivative of the unknown . ] form of the wave operator in a kerr background . differently to previously known symmetry operators for the wave operator",
    ", this operator contains only a partial time derivative of the first order , but not of higher order . as a consequence , in formulations of the initial value problem for the wave equation in terms of first order systems of pde and related formulations such as @xcite",
    ", this operator leads on a operator @xmath6 that formally commutes with the infinitesimal generator @xmath7 of time evolution and therefore is a candidate for the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup or group of symmetries . in precise terms",
    ", @xmath6 should lead to an operator @xmath8 that intertwines with the operators from the strongly continuous one - parameter group @xmath9 generated by @xmath7 @xcite , @xcite , i.e. , which is such that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the space of data for the wave equation which is a complex hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present note is to lay part of the foundation for a proof of the last in providing the new proof of the essential self - adjointness of the spatial part of the reduced normalized wave operator of the kerr metric in a weighted @xmath0-space .",
    "in addition , it is believed that the employed method in this might be applicable to other separable wave equations . as a consequence ,",
    "we also arrive at a purely operator theoretic proof of the well - posedness of the initial value problem of the reduced normalized klein - gordon equation in the gravitational field of a kerr black hole in the weighted @xmath0-space .",
    "the last space was already used in @xcite .",
    "also the last reference gives such a proof , but under the assumption that physical boundary conditions lead on the friedrichs extension of the operator that is obtained from the spatial part of the reduced normalized wave operator of the kerr metric by restriction to @xmath2-functions with compact support .",
    "in particular , the results in this note prove that this assumption is justified .",
    "in boyer - lindquist coordinates denote coordinate projections whose domains will be obvious from the context . in addition , we assume the composition of maps , which includes addition , multiplication and so forth , always to be maximally defined .",
    "for instance , the sum of two complex - valued maps is defined on the intersection of their domains .",
    "finally , we use planck units where the reduced planck constant @xmath13 , the speed of light in vacuum @xmath14 , and the gravitational constant @xmath15 , all have the numerical value @xmath16 . ] , @xmath17 , the kerr metric @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass , @xmath21 $ ] is the rotational parameter and @xmath22 in these coordinates , the reduced wave equation , governing solutions of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 runs through all integers , is given by @xmath25 the spatial part of the reduced normalized wave operator is given by @xmath26 for every @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , @xmath28 is singular since the continuous extensions of the coefficients of its highest ( second ) order radial derivative vanish on the horizon @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we represent the operator @xmath28 as the operator @xmath30 below in the weighted @xmath0-space @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the determinant of the matrix @xmath34 .",
    "note that @xmath35 is singular at the horizon .",
    "hence the elements of @xmath31 vanish there in the mean . in the limit @xmath36",
    ", this weight reduces to the one that is commonly used in the stability discussion of the schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "in the following , we prove that the operator @xmath37 defined below is linear , symmetric and essentially self - adjoint",

    "obviously , the domain of @xmath37 is a subspace of @xmath31 that contains @xmath51 .",

    "we note that the domain of @xmath37 contains all products @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the generalized legendre polynomial corresponding to @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath37 is essentially self - adjoint .    according to a well - known criterion for essential self - adjointness",
    ", it follows that @xmath37 is essentially self - adjoint if there is @xmath64 such that the range of @xmath65 is dense in @xmath31 .",
    "the existence of such @xmath66 will be shown in the following .",
    "for this , we note that the elementary inequalities @xmath67 imply that the underlying sets @xmath31 of @xmath68 are equal and that the corresponding norms that are induced on that set are equivalent .",
    "these facts are basic for the following . in a first step ,",
    "we note that the following holds for arbitrary @xmath69 and arbitrary @xmath47 in the domain of @xmath37 @xmath70 f \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , @xmath72 denote the maximal multiplication operators in @xmath31 with the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . as a consequence of ( [ basicineq ] )",
    ", @xmath75 is defined on the whole of @xmath31 as well as bounded and bijective .",
    "in addition , as a consequence of @xmath76 it follows that @xmath72 is a bounded positive self - adjoint operator on @xmath31 .",
    "motivated by ( [ fundrel ] ) , we define an auxiliary operator @xmath77 in @xmath68 whose domain @xmath78 coincides with the domain of @xmath37 and that is defined by @xmath79 for every @xmath80 . utilizing @xmath77 ,",
    "the identity ( [ basicineq ] ) is equivalent to @xmath81 for every @xmath80 .",
    "note that , differently to @xmath37 , @xmath77 can be obtained by ` separation ' from an operator which is in a certain sense ` spherically symmetric ' .",
    "this fact significantly simplifies the study of the properties of @xmath77 . in the next step ,",
    "we show that @xmath77 is a densely - defined , linear , symmetric and essentially self - adjoint operator in @xmath82 which is semibounded from below with lower bound @xmath83 in this , @xmath50 denotes the scalar product of @xmath82 .",

    "further , it follows for @xmath80 that @xmath87 hence it follows by green s theorem that @xmath88 and , finally , that @xmath77 is semibounded from below with lower bound @xmath89 .",
    "hence it follows that @xmath77 is essentially self - adjoint if there is @xmath90 such that the range of @xmath91 is dense in @xmath82 .",
    "this fact will be proved by application of the theory of sturm - liouville operators . for this , we define @xmath92 , @xmath93 and for every @xmath94 the sturm - liouville operators @xmath95 in @xmath96 by @xmath97 f \\right\\ } \\\\ & \\phantom{:}= - \\frac{1}{r^4/\\delta } \\left(\\triangle f^{\\ , \\prime } \\right)^{\\ , \\prime }   + \\frac{1}{r^4 }   \\left[l(l+1 ) \\ , \\delta - m^2 a^2 \\right ] f \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for every @xmath98 .",
    "obviously , @xmath99 are both densely - defined , linear and symmetric .",
    "the equation @xmath100 has nonvanishing constants as solutions .",
    "since these are not in @xmath101 at both ends of @xmath102 , it follows that @xmath103 is in the limit point case at @xmath104 and at @xmath105 .",
    "hence @xmath103 is essentially self - adjoint ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , since @xmath106/r^4 $ ] is bounded and real - valued , it follows from that by the rellich - kato theorem , e.g. , see theorem x.12 in volume ii of @xcite , that @xmath107 is also essentially self - adjoint and that the domains of the closures of @xmath103 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , coincide .",
    "obviously , @xmath108 is semibounded from below with lower bound @xmath89 .",
    "hence it follows that the range , @xmath110 of @xmath111 is dense in @xmath96 for @xmath90 . in the following ,",
    "we assume that @xmath90 .",

    "let @xmath117 be some hilbert basis of @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath118 is a hilbert basis of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 , the family @xmath121 is a hilbert basis of @xmath82 , where @xmath122 for every @xmath94 . since @xmath123 is dense in @xmath96 , it follows by ( [ basicrel ] ) that @xmath124 for every @xmath125 .",
    "since the span of the last family is dense in @xmath82 , this implies that @xmath126 is dense in @xmath82 .",
    "hence @xmath77 is also essentially self - adjoint . in the final step ,",
    "we use ( [ fundrelnew ] ) to prove that @xmath127 is dense in @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath91 is essentially self - adjoint such that @xmath128 is bijective and since @xmath129 is a positive bounded self - adjoint operator , it follows by the rellich - kato theorem that densely - defined , linear and symmetric operator @xmath130 is essentially self - adjoint and that the closure of this operator is bijective .",
    "hence the range of this operator is dense in @xmath82 as well as in @xmath31 .",
    "finally , since @xmath75 defines a bijective bounded linear operator in @xmath31 , it follows by help of ( [ fundrelnew ] ) that @xmath131 is dense in @xmath31 . since @xmath132 , the last implies that @xmath133 is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "in the case of a klein - gordon field of mass @xmath134 , the equation corresponding to ( [ waveequation ] ) is given by @xmath135 hence in this case , the operator corresponding to @xmath37 is defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the maximal multiplication operator in @xmath31 by the real - valued function @xmath138 defined by @xmath139 since the last is also bounded , @xmath137 is a bounded self - adjoint operator on @xmath31 .",
