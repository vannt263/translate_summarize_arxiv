    "the 2011 nobel prize in physics was awarded for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe @xcite . according to the present literature , theory that is most suitable for explaining",
    "this phenomenon is that of the cosmological constant @xmath0 , generally referred to as dark energy .",
    "although the cosmological constant or dark energy can be considered to account for the current expansion of the universe in the simple terms , the details are still far from clear . meanwhile ,",
    "several attempts have also been made for explaining this accelerating expansion without dark energy @xcite .    to verify the existence of the cosmological constant / dark energy and/or the potentiality of alternative gravitational theories , it is most natural to investigate their properties in the context of classical tests of general relativity , i.e. , the perihelion / periastron advance of celestial bodies and the deflection of light . to this end",
    ", we must elucidate the difference in such effects among the cosmological constant and the alternative gravitational theories .",
    "therefore , it is important to derive a rigorous formula for such effects resulting from the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "recently , the effect of the cosmological constant on the bending of light rays was intensively investigated and discussed by many authors ; the detailed reports can be found in @xcite and the references therein .    the influence of the cosmological constant on the orbital motion is a historical problem ( see section 45 of @xcite ) . in principle , it is clear that the cosmological constant contributes to the perihelion / periastrion advance , although this contribution is too small to detect because of @xmath5 .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy in the obtained precession formulae , in terms of the difference in the eccentricity dependence @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of cosmological constant on the orbital dynamics is also investigated in other papers @xcite , and constraints on the cosmological constant from the sun s motion through the milky way is recently discussed @xcite .",
    "in fact , this issue has been resolved in @xcite using the general framework of radial / central force perturbation .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that the physical interpretation of the formula derived in @xcite is the precession of hamilton s vector @xcite .",
    "a similar problem as that in @xcite was treated in terms of the gaussian planetary equation @xcite , and multiple scales method @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the correct eccentricity dependence is @xmath7 as previously shown in @xcite . however , in spite of these facts , some confusion still seems to exist ( refer to e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this short note is to arrange the discussions on the perihelion / periastron advance due to the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "in order to examine the additional perihelion / periastron advance due to @xmath0 , let us assume the spacetime to be spherically symmetric ; without loss of generality , we write the metric as @xmath8c^2 dt^2    + \\left [       1 - \\frac{r_g}{r } + w(r )      \\right]^{-1}dr^2 + r^2 d\\omega^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is an additional term that is a function of @xmath12 and generally depends on the gravitational theories .",
    "then , the geodesic equation of the test particle with mass @xmath13 becomes @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 is the proper time , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two constants of motion : the total energy and angular momentum , respectively . according to the standard approach ,",
    "we define the newtonian potential @xmath18 as @xmath19    = -\\frac{gm}{r } + \\frac{{\\cal l}^2}{2 r^2 } + \\frac{1}{2}w(r)c^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we set @xmath20 and let @xmath21 ; then , we have , @xmath22 if we rewrite @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is coordinate time ) , eq . ( [ eq : eom1 ] )",
    "becomes completely equivalent to eq .",
    "( 15 ) of @xcite .",
    "thus , henceforth , we follow the approach employed in @xcite .    the perihelion / periastron shift @xmath26 due to the perturbation potential @xmath27 with respect to newtonian potential @xmath28",
    "is expressed as ( see eq .",
    "( 30 ) in @xcite ) @xmath29 in which @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the semi - major axis of the orbit .",

    "( 15 ) in @xcite ) . however , in our case , @xmath27 or @xmath33 does not contain @xmath13 ; hence , hereafter , @xmath13 does not appear in the precession formula .",
    "we are interested in the power - law perturbing potentials of the type @xmath34 . noting the relation , @xmath35 we have the precession formula , @xmath36 for discussing the effect of cosmological constant @xmath0 , the schwarzschild  de sitter or kottler metric @xcite , @xmath37 is widely used and @xmath38 term causes famous general relativistic perihelion / periastron shift . in the case of perihelion / periastron advance due to @xmath0",
    ", we consider @xmath39 and then @xmath40 . it should be noted in this case , @xmath41 ; thus , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    the integral part in eq . ( [ eq : peri - formula2 ] ) is @xmath44 therefore , from eqs .",

    "in this short note , we commented on the perihelion / periastron advance of celestial bodies due to the cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "as we stated before , our prescription is based on @xcite , in which the problem of perihelion / periastron shift due to the cosmological constant @xmath0 has practically been resolved .",
    "however , we hope that this note contributes to clear up the confusion about the perihelion / periastron advance due to the cosmological constant @xmath0 , and is helpful in discussing the probability of alternative theories of gravitation since @xmath0-like terms arise also in various theoretical contexts such as @xmath72 @xcite and @xmath73 gravity @xcite .    just before closing this letter",

    "( [ eq : adv1 ] ) and ( [ eq : adv2 ] ) may assume implicitly that the background metric is minkowskian .",
    "therefore , the problem on perihelion / periastron advance due to cosmological constant @xmath0 should be investigated and discussed further in a careful manner in the context of real expanding universe ( see , for example , @xcite , and similar topic was recently discussed by @xcite ) .",
