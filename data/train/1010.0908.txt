    "graphene - related materials have been in the scientific limelight for the past few years due to the numerous applications envisaged for them@xcite . besides the huge potential for applicability , one key feature that makes graphene particularly popular",
    "is the simplicity with which many of its physical properties can be described , primarily due to the simple dispersion relation for its electrons .",
    "the linearity of this dispersion relation around the fermi level enables the description of graphene electrons in terms of massless dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "this introduces a great level of mathematical transparency in the portrayal of their properties , which nevertheless is limited only to a narrow range of energies around the fermi level .",
    "energy values outside this range are often needed , for example when gated graphene systems are considered@xcite or when calculation of a relevant physical quantity requires an integral over energy , but lack the mathematical transparency of those within the linear dispersion regime .    in this communication",
    "we show how this limitation can be circumvented by deriving a fully analytical closed - form expression for the single - electron green function of graphene in real space , a quantity that is instrumental in describing the behaviour of graphene electrons . because green functions are used in the study of several physical properties , improvements in their mathematical description will enable far more transparent and insightful expressions for the corresponding physical quantities .",
    "this is particularly true for distant - dependent interactions across a graphene sheet , for example the effect of an impurity on the physical properties of the system at a certain distance away from where it is introduced .",
    "another example is the interaction of two impurities embedded into the sheet . in both cases , for distances of more than a few lattice spacings ,",
    "the interactions involved are mediated by the conduction electrons of the graphene host .",
    "the green functions calculated in this paper describe the equilibrium properties of these electrons at low temperatures , allowing us to investigate the underlying interactions within a mathematically transparent framework .",
    "such a methodology allows for the prediction of certain features of the interaction without recourse to numerical calculations .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the general method for calculating the green function required is introduced in section [ methods_sec ] .",
    "the important directions of the graphene geometry , namely the _ armchair _ and _ zigzag _ directions are illustrated and an explicit calculation for the real - space off - diagonal green function element in each of these directions is performed in sections [ arm_dir ] and [ zig_dir ] , respectively .",
    "the accuracy of our approach is demonstrated by comparison with a fully numerical calculation .",
    "an extension of the method for arbitrary directions and inter - sublattice cases is discussed in section [ oth_dir ] .",
    "the potential applications of our approach are discussed in section [ gen_app ] , before an explicit illustration is given for the case of the magnetic interaction in graphene in section [ rkky_app ] . here",
    "a fully analytical method is used to derive the principal features of the interaction within the rkky approximation .",
    "the general formula for the single - electron green function , within the nearest - neighbour tight - binding framework , in its eigenstate basis is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy , @xmath2 is the eigenvector labeled by the wave vector @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the corresponding eigenvalue defined as @xmath5        the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the lattice parameter of graphene and its nearest - neighbour electronic hopping@xcite , respectively , which are hereafter used as our units of distance and energy .",
    "our choice is such that the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) direction is aligned to the zigzag ( armchair ) geometry of the graphene lattice as is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "a simple unitary transformation defines the real - space basis @xmath10 , where the index @xmath11 labels the two - atom unit cell and the index @xmath12 refers to the intra - cell atoms corresponding to the two distinct sublattices of graphene , represented by filled and hollow circles in figure [ schematic ] .",
    "when projected onto two different states @xmath10 and @xmath13 located in real space by the respective vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the green function is written as @xmath16 where the integrals over @xmath17 and @xmath18 are performed over the first brillouin zone of graphene .",
    "although we have selected two states that belong to the same sublattice ( @xmath19 ) , this constraint can be easily relaxed and generalized to describe the propagator between sites on different sublattices . before proceeding",
    ", we will outline the basic steps taken to obtain the green function .",
    "we tackle the first integral by analytical continuation to the complex plane , where it is subsequently solved using the residue theorem.@xcite the remaining integral can then be solved in the case of moderately large separation vectors by using the stationary phase approximation ( spa).@xcite      we first consider the case of separation vectors @xmath20 along the ( armchair ) @xmath9-direction . by showing how to obtain the green function for this particular case we hope to illustrate the general method for calculating green functions for any direction .",

    "tends to vanish for any sizable separation @xmath37 , meaning that the stationary values outside the ranges listed in eq.([tilde ] ) should have very little influence in the overall results for the green functions.@xcite the same can be understood from purely geometrical arguments applied to the constant energy surfaces of @xmath40 in reciprocal space , depicted in fig .",
    "[ constant_energy ] . when searching for stationary solutions for @xmath30 , which in this case lie parallel to the @xmath9-axis , the two solutions resulting from eq.([tilde ] ) are the only possible ( real ) ones within the rectangular brillouin zone of the hexagonal lattice .",

    "however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ figarm ] there is hardly any noticeable difference between the analytical and numerical results across the entire energy band .",

    "this expression arises from the decision to take the contour integral along the @xmath83-space direction parallel to the separation vector @xmath20 , which results in a phase term equal to the pole of the contour integral .",
    "since the expressions for the poles in the armchair and zigzag directions , eqs .",
    "( [ poles ] ) and ( [ zigzagpoles ] ) respectively , are easily found from eq .",
    "( [ graphene ] ) , the calculation of all the necessary quantities is quite straightforward . to extend this approach to an arbitrary separation vector",
    ", we must first rewrite eq .",
    "( [ graphene ] ) in terms of @xmath83-space vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 which are parallel and perpendicular respectively to the required separation vector . following this",
    ", we must perform the contour integral over @xmath84 to get an expression for the green function analogous to eq .",
    "( [ remaining ] ) .",
    "however , the expression for the poles of this contour integral will depend strongly on the separation vector chosen and will usually result from a high order polynomial equation that may need to be solved numerically .",
    "it is important to note that this equation will only depend on the direction , and not the length , of the separation vector , so that once the green function for a particular direction has been constructed it is valid for any required distance across the graphene lattice in that direction .",
    "a similar methodology holds for the case of green functions between sites on the different sublattices of graphene . in this case",
    "( [ above ] ) must be altered slightly to read @xmath86 where now we have @xmath87 , with @xmath88 .",
    "the integral can now be split into two parts with different phase terms coming from the two components of @xmath89 .",
    "these can then be solved individually using the approach described above to give the required green function .",
    "the usefulness of having an analytical expression for the real space green function , valid throughout the entire electronic energy band , becomes obvious when physical properties of graphene involving energy scales outside the linear dispersion region are investigated .",
    "this is particularly advantageous when such properties carry size or position dependence because in this case eq.([sol_x ] ) for the armchair direction , or eq.([sol_zz ] ) for the zigzag direction , can be more concisely expressed in the form @xmath90 so that the @xmath1- and @xmath37-dependences are clearly distinguished .",
    "furthermore , even in the case when the functional form of the coefficient @xmath91 is not particularly simple , the expressions in eqs.([sol_x ] ) and ( [ sol_zz ] ) can be used to expand the green function in a polynomial series , which is undoubtedly far simpler and more treatable than the original expression in eq.([above ] ) .",
    "we anticipate that the ability to clearly isolate the distance dependence in the green function will allow a more transparent treatment of some of the more eagerly investigated properties of graphene .    this approach will be shown more clearly in the next section when our formalism is used to investigate the magnetic interaction between two magnetic moments in graphene .",
    "this type of interaction is perfectly suited for investigation using our approach since it is mediated by the conduction electrons of the graphene host . however , there are many other interesting physical properties that can be explored .",
    "the interaction between precessing magnetic moments is one area of particular interest . within the random phase approximation",
    "this dynamic coupling can be described by an integral over a complex function involving the convolution of green functions .",
    "initial numerical results in carbon nanotubes , which are closely related to graphene , suggest that the range of the dynamic interaction may be greater than that of the more familiar static case@xcite .",
    "we anticipate that an extension of the description provided below for the static case may be useful in attempting to solve the required integral analytically and understand the distance dependence of the dynamic coupling .",
    "the ability of our approach to obtain green functions over a very large fraction of the energy band becomes increasingly important in this case due to the convolution of green functions of different energies that appears in the expression .",
    "another topic that lends itself to our approach is the effect of disorder@xcite and in particular , the effect of an impurity , on the properties of graphene .",
    "friedel oscillations , occuring in the local density of states as a function of distance from an introduced impurity , have been studied within the linear dispersion regime using a green function formalism@xcite .",
    "although the local density of states is associated with the diagonal term of the green function , the distance dependence of the oscillations will be determined solely by the off - diagonal term calculated here .",
    "similarly , the signatures of magnetic adatoms in graphene when probed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy have also been investigated using a theoretical approach@xcite .",
    "this method again avails of green function methods within the linear dispersion regime .",
    "we anticipate that our approach may allow for an extension of such studies to energies beyond the linear dispersion regime .",
    "to demonstrate the power and applicability of our new formalism , we turn our attention to the magnetic interaction in graphene .",
    "this interaction determines the relative orientation of magnetic moments embedded in graphene and has been the subject of many recent papers@xcite , as an understanding of this interaction is a major step in the implementation of graphene devices in the field of spintronics .",
    "when the linear dispersion approximation is used , a cut - off function is required to prevent the result diverging due to high energy contributions .",
    "there has been some debate about the effect of the cutoff function chosen on the resultant interaction calculated@xcite . other approaches to circumvent this problem",
    "involve numerical calculations@xcite which can lack the transparency of an analytical solution . here",
    "we shall show that the decay rate and oscillation period of the interaction as a function of distance emerge naturally from a simple calculation using our formalism and without resorting to an energy cut - off or a restriction to the linear dispersion regime .",
    "the exchange energy , @xmath92 , within the rkky approximation@xcite is proportional to the static susceptibility , @xmath93 , which can in turn be written in terms of green functions , allowing us to write @xmath94 for two moments occupying like - sites in the graphene lattice separated by a distance @xmath37 , where @xmath95 is the fermi function .",
    "this quantity relates to the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignment of the moments , with its sign giving the energetically favourable alignment . using the expression in eq .",
    "( [ concise ] ) we write @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , t being the temperature and @xmath99 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the integral in eq ( [ j_integral ] ) can be solved by replacing it with a contour integral in the energy upper - half plane . in this case",
    "the poles are given by the zeroes of the denominator of the fermi function , namely the matsubara frequencies , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an integer labelling the poles .",
    "writing the coefficient @xmath102 as a taylor series , and the wavevector @xmath103 as a first order expansion , around the fermi energy gives @xmath104 using @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) to denote the @xmath107th derivative of @xmath108 ( @xmath49 ) evaluated at the fermi energy .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath109 in the low temperature limit , @xmath110 , this expression simplifies to one of the form @xmath111 in this form the oscillation period and decay rate of the interaction at different fermi energies can be easily extracted .",
    "the decay rate in the asymptotic limit@xcite is determined by the leading term in eq ( [ j_simple ] ) , namely @xmath112 , suggesting that , in general , @xmath113 . however , at @xmath114 , it is straightforward to determine from eq .",

    "as far as the authors are aware , this is the first time this has been performed within a fully analytical framework .",
    "in summary , we have derived closed - form expressions for the single - electron green function of graphene in real space that does not rely on the linearity of its dispersion relation near the fermi level . the full derivation of this quantity for the two principal directions investigated on the graphene lattice has been presented along with a discussion for extending the methodology to other cases .",

    "<S> among the many interesting features displayed by graphene , one of the most attractive is the simplicity with which its electronic structure can be described . the study of its physical properties is significantly simplified by the linear dispersion relation of electrons in a narrow range around the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the mathematical simplicity of graphene electrons is only limited to this narrow energy region and is not very practical when dealing with problems that involve energies outside the linear dispersion part of the spectrum . in this communication </S>",
    "<S> we remedy this limitation by deriving a set of closed - form analytical expressions for the real - space single - electron green function of graphene which is valid across a large fraction of the energy spectrum . by extending to a wider energy range the simplicity with which graphene electrons are described </S>",
    "<S> , it is now possible to derive more mathematically transparent and insightful expressions for a number of physical properties that involve higher energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> the power of this new formalism is illustrated in the case of the magnetic ( rkky ) interaction in graphene . </S>"
