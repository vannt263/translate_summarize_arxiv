    "galaxies in clusters experience a variety of environmental interactions that affect their evolution ( see boselli & gavazzi 2006 for a review ) .",
    "intracluster medium ( icm ) interactions such as ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) and starvation ( larson , tinsley , & caldwell 1980 ) prematurely remove gaseous reservoirs . tidal interactions , including nearby , slower encounters in cluster and group substructures ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) , nearby high velocity encounters ( duc & bournaud 2008 ) , and galaxy harassment ( moore _ et al . _",
    "1996 , 1998 ; bekki _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) , rearrange stellar and gaseous contents .",
    "these interactions potentially explain the observed gas deficiencies ( giovanelli & haynes 1983 , cayatte _ et al . _   1990 ) , reduced star formation ( kennicutt 1983 ; koopmann & kenney 2004 ) , and morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) in clusters .",
    "environmental interactions can produce low surface brightness stellar and gas tails .",
    "et al . _  ( 2007 ) find one - sided hi tails in seven virgo spirals , attributing them to the influence of the icm .",
    "oosterloo & van gorkom ( 2005 ) report a 110 x 25 kpc plume of hi gas extending away from the hi - deficient virgo spiral ngc 4388 , also attributing the feature to icm interaction .",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) find stellar streams associated with several presumably tidal events near the virgo cluster core .",
    "similar features have been found in coma and centaurus ( gregg & west 2004 ) .",
    "the characteristics of tail features are related to the details of the environmental interaction that produced them , helping to determine the relative importance of different interactions .",
    "tidal tails may allow the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies , contributing to the dwarf galaxy population .",
    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey , a sensitive blind survey of the arecibo sky ( giovanelli _ et al . _",
    "2005 ) , is providing a complete and unbiased view of hi content and structures in the entire virgo cluster region .",
    "the survey has revealed the presence of several hi clouds without optical components ( kent _ et al . _  2007 ) and a 250 kpc extended tidal arc emerging from the sc galaxy ngc 4254 .",
    "this structure , encompassing the virgo hi21 cloud ( minchin _ et al . _   2007",
    ") , is likely due to a high velocity close galaxy encounter ( haynes _ et al . _  2007",
    "; duc & bournaud 2008 ) .    in this letter , we report the detection by alfalfa of an even larger tidal feature associated with the virgo cluster pair ngc 4532/ddo 137 .",
    "this pair of smiii / smiv ( binggeli , sandage , & tammann 1985 ) galaxies is located in the virgo b cloud ( binggeli , popescu , & tammann 1993 ) , 6@xmath6 south of the virgo center .",
    "ngc 4532 is the brightest sm cataloged in the virgo cluster catalog ( binggeli , sandage & tammann 1985 ; hereafter vcc ) and has a high star formation rate ( koopmann & kenney 2004 ) and an asymmetric stellar morphology .",
    "the galaxies share a common hi envelope extended over 150 kpc ( hoffman _ et al . _",
    "1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) found that the hi envelope contains three additional discrete hi clumps that have no optical counterparts as well as a significant diffuse hi component , some of which appeared as a tail - like extension to the southwest .",
    "we show that there is indeed an extended hi structure , stretching @xmath0 500 kpc beyond the pair .",
    "section  [ obs ] describes alfalfa and optical followup observations of the extended hi structure and section  [ disc ] addresses possible formation mechanisms .",
    "we assume a virgo cluster distance of 16.7 mpc ( e.g. , mei _ et al . _",
    "2007 ) throughout .",
    "the alfalfa survey is mapping 7074 square degrees of the high galactic sky visible from arecibo , using the 7-feed arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) on the 305 m antenna .",
    "the survey characteristics are documented by giovanelli _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) .",

    "extensive low hi column density ( @xmath13 ) gas is apparent throughout this region in several channel maps , as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "we measure an hi mass of 6.0 x 10@xmath14 m@xmath2  for the hi envelope surrounding the pair , consistent with that of hoffman _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "an additional hi mass of 1.3 x 10@xmath3 m@xmath2   is contained within a partially resolved clump @xmath0 20@xmath12 west of ngc 4532 , hereafter the ` western clump . '",
    "the hi extension is defined by discrete clumps as well as diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "fluxes , velocities , and masses of the discrete clumps are presented in table  [ tab1 ] ( see giovanelli _",
    "et al . _  2007 for details about determination of listed parameters ) .",
    "clumps are numbered in order of their right ascension and their positions are labeled with these numbers in figure  [ fig1]a .",
    "several of the clumps are marginally resolved by the alfalfa beam and show elongated structure .",
    "velocity widths of the clumps range from 34 to 112 km  s@xmath9 , values similar to those of low luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "most clumps are single - peaked .",
    "clump # 8 coincides spatially and in velocity with the galaxy tololo 1232 + 052 , a dwarf galaxy ( m@xmath15 = -15 ) with a blue color and prominent emission lines ( sdss ; york _ et al . _  2000 ) , making it a tidal dwarf candidate .",
    "all of the emission in the hi extension is blueshifted with respect to ngc 4532/ddo 137 .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b shows that the velocity field is highly ordered .",
    "there are two ridges separated spectrally by about 100 km  s@xmath9and spatially by about 10@xmath12 east - west .",
    "the eastern ridge is closest in velocity to the envelope surrounding ngc 4532/ddo137 and is similar in velocity to the hook - like feature emerging northeast of the envelope ( see also figure 2 of hoffman _",
    "et al . _",
    "1993 ) . the western ridge , which includes the portion that extends south and then curves toward the east , extends to the lowest velocities in the system , overlapping spectrally with the western clump .",
    "the total hi mass contained within discrete clumps is 3.9 x 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "diffuse emission traces the ridges between the main clumps , with an hi mass of @xmath01x10@xmath3 m@xmath2 .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath02 x 10@xmath3 m@xmath2   can be placed on the mass below the alfalfa limiting @xmath13 of 3 x 10@xmath16 cm@xmath5 , assuming a total area of 500 x 20 kpc .",
    "thus the total mass in the structure has an upper limit 7 x 10@xmath3 m@xmath2 , approximately 10% of the hi mass within the disks of the two galaxies in the pair .",
    "deep @xmath18- and @xmath4-band imaging of several fields in the hi extension was carried out at the 40-inch telescope at wise observatory on the nights of 18 , 19 , and 21 may , 2007 , using the pi - ccd camera with a pixel scale of 0.6 arcsec pixel@xmath9 .",
    "additional fields were imaged in @xmath4-band at the wiyn 0.9 m at kitt peak observatory on the night of 21 may , 2007 , using the s2 kb ccd camera with pixel scale of 0.6 arcsec pixel@xmath9 .",
    "images were reduced in iraf using standard procedures .",
    "wise @xmath4-band images from 18 may and the wiyn @xmath4-band images reach a surface brightness level of 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath5 and 25.5 mag arcsec@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "scattered light contaminates wise @xmath4-band images in several fields .",
    "the @xmath18-band images reach a surface brightness level of @xmath024.4 mag arcsec@xmath5 , comparable to the sdss .",
    "faint galaxies visible in these fields either lack redshifts or are at high redshift ( sloan digital sky survey ; york _ et al . _  2000",
    ") and few are good matches for the hi clump positions .",
    "thus , with the exception of tololo 1232 + 052 , no dwarf galaxy - like sources ( i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath20 kpc ) are seen to coincide with the hi clumps in figure  [ fig1]a .",

    "we have discovered an extremely long ( 500 kpc ) hi stream of low @xmath13 , dotted by higher density clumps appearing as isolated hi clouds , most with no optical counterpart , apparently associated with the galaxy pair ngc 4532/ddo 137 .",
    "the characteristics of the system are reminiscent of those reported by kent et al  ( 2007 ) , haynes et al  ( 2007 ) , and tripp ( 2007 ) , also found mainly in the periphery of the virgo cluster .",

    "the total hi mass is a factor of 1.5 - 16 times larger than that reported for other hi tails , although the fractional mass of @xmath010% of the presumed host system is similar .",
    "the ngc 4532/ddo 137 pair is located at a projected distance of 1.8 mpc south of m87 and 0.5 mpc southwest of m49 ( ngc 4472 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) identify the galaxies as members of the virgo b cloud , which is centered near m49 and lies at about the same distance as the more massive virgo a cloud centered near m87 ( binggeli _ et al . _",

    ". _  1999 )",
    "the extended hi envelope is presumably less tightly bound and would be more susceptible to stripping .",
    "a challenge for an icm interpretation is the length of the feature : it is an order of magnitude longer than other observed and simulated ( e.g. , vollmer _ et al .",
    "_  2001 ; roediger & brggen 2008 ) features .",
    "in addition , it extends south of the pair , implying a trajectory that did not take the pair through the densest and hottest part of the icm , as traced by rosat ( bhringer _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) and asca ( shibata _ et al . _  2001 ) .",
    "tidal interactions naturally produce long , gas - rich tails ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "ngc 4532 and ddo 137 appear to be a bound pair and could be interacting .",
    "ngc 4532 shows other symptoms of tidal interaction : it is optically asymmetric and has a high star formation rate ( koopmann _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) and disturbed velocity field ( rubin _ et al._1999 ; chemin _ et al . _  2005",
    "; hoffman _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "the hi extension described here displays a highly ordered velocity field .",
    "however low velocity tidal interactions between galaxies tend to produce symmetric tails of gas and stars ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; hibbard _ et al . _  2001 ) . in this case",
    "no stellar tail has yet been found and the hi extension and excess hi envelope gas not identified with the galaxies ( hoffman _ et al . _",
    "1999 ) display strong kinematic and spatial asymmetries .",
    "these peculiarities could be consistent with a higher velocity encounter with another massive galaxy .",
    "models of high velocity ( @xmath0 1000 km s@xmath9 ) close galaxy encounters ( duc & bournaud 2008 ) share some similarities to low velocity encounters , e.g. , the length of the tail and the formation of dense clumps along tails , but produce lower mass , asymmetric , gas - dominated tails .",
    "duc & bournaud ( 2008 ) are able to reproduce the 250 kpc long hi tail extending northward from ngc 4254 ( haynes _ et al . _  2007 ) via an encounter 750 myr ago at a speed of 1100 km s@xmath9 with a galaxy 50% more massive .",

    "ngc 4532 and ddo 137 have line - of - sight velocities of @xmath0 2000 km s@xmath9 ( 2@xmath24 1000 km s@xmath9 greater than virgo b mean ) so that a high speed encounter with a b member is possible . as argued by duc & bournaud ( 2008 )",
    ", the perturber may be further away ; a galaxy moving at 1000 km s@xmath9 can travel a projected distance of @xmath0 1 mpc in 1 gyr .",
    "we note that alfalfa observations , to date complete to + 4@xmath600@xmath12 , show no other extended hi features associated with other galaxies in the vicinity .    based upon the available models",
    ", we suggest that the structure associated with ngc 4532/ddo 137 is most consistent with a tidal interaction , possibly a high velocity encounter .",
