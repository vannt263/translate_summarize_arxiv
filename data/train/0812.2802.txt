    "turbulent transport is an important process , by which various physical quantities are rapidly mixed by the advection of turbulent fluid .",
    "examples include the mixing of chemical species , dissipation of magnetic fields , transport of angular momentum in astrophysical / laboratory plasmas , the mixing of pollution in the terrestrial atmosphere or even the transport of warm water in oceans .",
    "in fact , the effect of turbulent transport in our lives is fundamental .",
    "turbulent transport can however have an unwelcoming consequence , such as anomalous heat / energy loss in laboratory plasmas , leading to the degradation of plasma confinement .",
    "it is therefore crucial to understand the physics of turbulent transport , especially some means of controlling it .",
    "one of the promising mechanisms for quenching turbulence mixing is flow shear suppression @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that shearing of turbulent eddies by flow shear leads to a cascade of eddies into smaller and smaller scales down to the dissipative scale where the molecular dissipation efficiently removes the energy .",
    "that is , the shear flow rapidly generates small scales , thereby enhancing the overall dissipation of turbulent eddies which are responsible for turbulent transport . as a result ,",
    "both turbulence level and transport are reduced @xcite .",
    "in fact , there has been accumulating experimental evidences for turbulence regulation by flow shear in laboratory plasmas , which is now thought to be indispensable for the formation of transport barriers @xcite . a crucial question in understanding the formation of transport barrier in a variety of systems",
    "is thus , how much of turbulent transport is reduced by a given flow shear compared to the case in the absence of the flow shear .",
    "quantitative theoretical predictions for turbulent transport were provided in different types of turbulence models for steady @xcite or random shear flows @xcite .    in comparison with a steady shear flow ,",
    "turbulence regulation by time - varying shear flow is more complex , with its efficiency depending on characteristic time scales of the shear flow and turbulence such as their frequencies , decorrelation times , shearing rate , etc . @xcite .",
    "for instance , if a shear flow oscillates rapidly with its frequency much larger than the turbulent decorrelation rate , its shearing is too incoherent to have any effect on turbulent transport .",
    "in contrast , if the flow shear is sufficiently strong such that its shearing rate involves the fastest time scale , it can be considered to be steady and thus has a similar effect on turbulent transport as a steady shear flow .",
    "for instance , in this limit , turbulent mixing of passive scalar fields is reduced inversely proportional to the rms shearing rate @xmath0 as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "what happens in between these two extreme limits is far less obvious .",
    "while theoretical predictions in a scalar field model are provided by kim @xcite , they are given in terms of multiple integrals which could be reduced to simple analytical forms only in the extreme limits , yielding transparent scalings with @xmath0 only in these limits .",
    "further quantitative study is thus necessary in order to understand how efficiently an oscillatory shear flow controls turbulent mixing in general .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the aforementioned reduction in turbulent transport by flow shear results from the modification of the turbulence properties ( e.g. enhanced dissipation of turbulence / fluctuations ) when the flow shear can have no influence on the mean field profile , for instance , when a mean field , being uniform along the shear flow , varies only transverse to the shear flow .",
    "this is relevant for the study of turbulent transport where main the interest lies in the transport mediated by turbulence . in the case when a mean field varies along the shear flow as well as transverse to it , the shear flow has a direct influence on mean field since it can distort the distribution of the mean field , thereby rapidly generating small scales which then get efficiently damped by the molecular diffusion [ for example , see refs .",
    "that is , the same shear distortion that enhances the dissipation of turbulent eddies , leading to the reduction in turbulent transport , can speed up the diffusion of mean field if it directly operates on the mean field .",
    "therefore , in general , when shear flow can modify the mean field as well as turbulence , the overall effect of the shear flow on turbulent transport will be determined by the competition between these two conflicting effects .",
    "it is also important to note that propagating oscillatory shear flows ( waves ) have often been invoked as a mechanism for transport @xcite .",
    "examples include internal gravity waves which can transport momentum , mass , heat , etc in astrophysical and geophysical systems [ e.g. see , ref @xcite ] .",
    "the transport by these waves is however a slow process compared to turbulent transport as the former requires non - ideal effect such as molecular dissipation . on the other hand ,",
    "oscillatory shear flows can potentially mediate fast transport by destabilizing the equilibrium via parametric resonance @xcite . in the presence of turbulence , the interaction between oscillatory shear flows and turbulent flows could lead to similar parametric resonance , as indicated by kim @xcite , significantly contributing to the transport . without this resonance ,",
    "the effect of oscillatory shear flows on laminar diffusion can be opposite since the shear enhanced mixing becomes negligible as the oscillation frequency of the shear flow increases above the rms shearing rate @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed quantitative study of the effect of oscillatory shear flow on turbulent transport of passive scalar fields . in particular , we derive the asymptotic scalings of turbulence amplitude and transport with the rms shear strength via numerical integrations of the theoretical results derived by kim @xcite .",
    "we distinguish three different scaling regimes depending on the characteristic time scales of turbulence and oscillatory shear flow , identify the two types of resonances ( doppler and parametric resonances ) , and then obtain asymptotic scalings with rms shearing rate valid in each regime by numerical computations .",
    "we show that turbulent diffusion depends crucially on the competition between suppression due to shearing and enhancement due to the resonances , thereby suggesting that oscillatory shear flows can enhance the value of turbulent diffusion , accelerating turbulent mixing .",
    "we note that our numerical integration has a great advantage of permitting a thorough parameter scan in parameter space , which is not easily accessible by direct numerical computations ( e.g. in the limit of small dissipation ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we present the time - averaged turbulence amplitude and transport in dimensionless form . in  iii , we identify the three scaling regimes depending on characteristic time scales by simple analytical examination .  iv contains the results of numerical computations and scalings of turbulence amplitude and transport with rms shearing rate .",

    "we consider a passive scalar field model where a passive scalar @xmath2 is advected by a given turbulent flow @xmath3 and shear flow @xmath4 while being diffused by molecular dissipation @xmath5 . by quasi - linear analysis , the fluctuating scalar field @xmath6 evolves according to the following equation :    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 is the large - scale component .",
    "we assume that the shear flow is in the @xmath9 direction , varying linearly in @xmath10 , and is oscillatory in time of the form @xmath11 ; @xmath12 and @xmath0 are the frequency and rms shearing rate of the oscillating shear flow . note that since both @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend only on @xmath10 while @xmath14 is in the @xmath9 direction , there is no direct effect of the shear flow on the mean field @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) .",
    "that is , the shear flow influences the mean field only indirectly through its effect on turbulence .",
    "the advection by a linear shear flow @xmath16 results in the distortion of an eddy ( i.e. , wind - up ) , and its effect can be non - perturbatively captured by employing a time - dependent wavenumber @xmath17 with the following transformation for @xmath6 : @xmath18 and similarly for @xmath19 , with @xmath20 satisfying an eikonal equation @xmath21 it is worth noting that eq .",

    "we here emphasize that @xmath29 grows at most linearly in time for the oscillatory shear flow as @xmath20 oscillates in time ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ) , with its shearing becoming effective only when it operates coherently before the oscillatory zonal flows change shearing direction , i.e. when @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this is distinctively different from the behaviour of @xmath29 in the case of mean shear flows or random zonal flows : ( i ) in the case of mean shear flows @xcite , @xmath20 grows linearly in time with @xmath32 ; ( ii ) in the case of random zonal flows @xcite @xmath20 can be considered as a random process with the time average of @xmath33 on a long , diffusive time scale , and thus @xmath34 .",

    "further , @xmath61 is likely to be positive , especially for a short - correlated turbulence or for weak turbulence quenched by strong shear , where a quasi - linear analysis becomes exact .",

    "an interesting question is then what happens to the transport / diffusion of large - scale magnetic fields when the backreaction is sufficiently strong to modify the characteristics of turbulence . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to study whether oscillatory shear flows can weaken the severe quenching in the amplification of magnetic fields ( the so - called dynamos ) in 3d and their diffusion rate in 2d due to the magnetic backreactions .",
