    "no such features are apparent in ngc 4254 , which lacks a strong bar .",

    "we consider two scenarios that could explain our observations : ( 1 ) changes in the abundances of the observed molecules , and ( 2 ) changes in the optical depths of the observed lines .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath0co / c@xmath1o will vary if the relative abundance of the two species varies .",
    "we highlight selective photodissociation , isotope dependent fractionation , and selective enrichment by massive star nucleosynthesis as possible explanations .",
    "ultraviolet radiation dissociates the molecules in molecular clouds , and preferential dissociation of one species or another could change the @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio .",
    "selective photodissociation is possible because @xmath0co is more effective at self - shielding against uv photons than c@xmath1o due to its higher abundance @xcite .",
    "however , even for the far more abundant isotopolgue @xmath2co , @xcite find that self - shielding is only comparable in importance to shielding by dust and cross - shielding by the lyman - werner damping wings of h@xmath25 .",
    "for the much less abundant @xmath0co and c@xmath1o , self - shielding must therefore be unimportant compared to dust- and h@xmath25-shielding , which are non - selective .",
    "indeed , using ` despotic ` @xcite , we find that these mechanisms together are sufficient to reduce the dissociation rate for @xmath2co and its isotopologues to near zero for columns of @xmath30 @xmath31 , even if there is no self - shielding .",
    "we can therefore discard the possibility of selective photodissociation as an explanation for our results .",
    "alternatively , isotope dependent fractionation may lead to different abundances . in cold regions , where ion - molecule chemistry dominates",
    ", there would be preferential formation of @xmath0co by chemical fractionation :    @xmath32    if , as expected , cloud temperature scales with @xmath27 , and the c@xmath1o abundance is not affected by fractionation processes , then the @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio will decrease with @xmath27 and will increase with the distance to the center of the galaxy .",
    "this could explain the increasing radial profiles for the sample if the gas is cold enough further out in their disks , as well as the increasing profiles seen in figure [ fig : trends ] as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "it would not explain the decrement in the @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio of ngc628 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "very massive stars produce @xmath2c at the end of their lives .",
    "the @xmath1o is also produced by high - mass stars , but the yield depends on the amount of @xmath2c and @xmath33o that is available .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0c is only produced as a result from the cn cycle of helium burning in intermediate - mass stars , or as a secondary product in low and high mass ( @xmath2810 m@xmath34 ) stars .",
    "thus , one would expect recent star formation to increase the @xmath1o and @xmath2c abundances on a short timescale , as massive stars explode as supernovae and enrich the ism .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath0c comes primarily from the red giant phase of intermediate - mass stars and requires more time to enrich the ism .",
    "c@xmath1o could thus be expected to become overabundant relative to @xmath0co in regions where enrichment from young stars sets the isotopic abundances . in reality , the abundances in the molecular gas will reflect a complex combination of pre - existing enrichment , enrichment from recent star formation , and removal of gas by feedback .",
    "but the basic explanation is that gas preferentially enriched by massive stars should show low @xmath0co / c@xmath1o .",
    "abundance variations due to selective nucleosynthesis offer a plausible mechanism that explains the increasing radial profiles of our sample .",
    "however , the observed @xmath2c/@xmath0c abundance ratio in the milky way shows the opposite trend @xcite , implying that the @xmath33o/@xmath1o abundance ratio decreases with galactocentric radius as well .",
    "this argues against nucleosynthesis as a general explanation . in ngc628 where the radial profiles are flat , there could be older populations where the @xmath0c has been created more efficiently and well mixed back into the ism afterwards .",
    "this galaxy could also present strong fractionation effects ; however more lines are needed to investigate it in detail .",
    "our observations could also be explained if the optical depth of @xmath0co changes across a galaxy .",
    "we expect that @xmath2co remains optically thick over most areas in our targets .",
    "variations in @xmath0co optical depth could result from changing line widths or changes in excitation due to temperature or density variations ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "we gauge the importance of the optical depth effects on our @xmath0co measurements by comparing to @xmath2co measurements ( jimnez - donaire et al . in prep . ,",
    "cormier et al . , in prep . )",
    "assuming that the @xmath2co is optically thick and that both species have a common excitation temperature and beam filling factor ( our observations show that @xmath0co and @xmath2co have similar large structure , similarly to @xcite ) the ratio allows us to estimate the optical depth of the @xmath0co transition , @xmath35 . applying these simple assumptions to our observations , and assuming that the co  ( 2 - 1 ) measured by heracles is approximately thermalized with the co  ( 1 - 0 )",
    ", we find @xmath36 .",
    "these values imply optically thin @xmath0co across our sample at the factor of @xmath37 level , even if our simplifying assumptions break down .",
    "in other words , based on the observed @xmath0co/@xmath2co line ratios , which are substantially lower than @xmath38 , the @xmath0co emission that we observe appears mostly optically thin . in order to explain our observed line ratio variations , the @xmath0co line would need to become optically thick over some regions .",
    "thus , we do not expect that the high @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratios that we observe originate from changes in @xmath35 . to illustrate this ,",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : alma_rad ] shows the expected dependence of the isotopologue ratio on the optical depth of @xmath0co over the range of modest @xmath39 that we find .",
    "the effect of changing optical depth in this regime is negligible .",
    "we instead prefer one of the abundance - based explanations described above .",
    "we report observations of the 1 - 0 transitions of @xmath0co and c@xmath1o across the disks of nine nearby galaxies from the iram 30 m program empire and alma . using a spectral stacking approach",
    ", we measured the radial variation of this ratio and its dependence on the local surface density of star formation .",
    "because of the faintness of the c@xmath1o line , this is the first significant sample of @xmath0co / c@xmath1o radial profiles for nearby galaxy disks .",
    "averaging over whole galaxy disks , we find a mean value of @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio of @xmath40 with no clear variations from galaxy to galaxy . in ngc  4254 ,",

    "@xmath0co / c@xmath1o increases by @xmath1840% with increasing radius .",
    "we also find a decreasing @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio with increasing surface density of star formation . as a result ,",

    "this central value resembles that found in the milky way , but differs from values for starburst galaxies ( 3.4@xmath30.9 ) and ulirgs ( 1.1@xmath30.4 ) .",
    "we argue that @xmath0co optical depth is unlikely to drive our observed trends . instead , we suggest that the variations in the observed ratios reflect real changes in the abundance of the two species , driven by either selective enrichment of the ism in active regions by massive star nucleosynthesis , or a decrease in the amount of @xmath0co due to suppression of @xmath0co in hotter , higher column density environments .",

    "<S> we use the iram large program empire and new high - resolution alma data to measure @xmath0co(1 - 0)/c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) intensity ratios across nine nearby spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these isotopologues of @xmath2co are typically optically thin across most of the area in galaxy disks , and this ratio allows us to gauge their relative abundance due to chemistry or stellar nucleosynthesis effects . resolved @xmath0co </S>",
    "<S> / c@xmath1o gradients across normal galaxies have been rare due to the faintness of these lines . </S>",
    "<S> we find a mean @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio of 6.0@xmath30.9 for the central regions of our galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this agrees well with results in the milky way , but differs from results for starburst galaxies ( 3.4@xmath30.9 ) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( 1.1@xmath30.4 ) . in our sample , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0co / c@xmath1o ratio consistently increases with increasing galactocentric radius and decreases with increasing star formation rate surface density . </S>",
    "<S> these trends qualitatively agree with expectations for carbon and oxygen isotopic abundance variations due to stellar nucleosynthesis , with a possible effect of fractionation . </S>"
