    "in increasingly numerous studies being done on quaternary semiconductor systems promising for photovoltaic applications , kesterite - type cu@xmath0znsnx@xmath2 ( x = s , se ) @xcite , a `` secondary phase '' cu@xmath0snx@xmath1 gains importance @xcite as a not always welcome , but annoyingly robust , member of the quaternary phase diagram @xcite . it would be good to reliably identify , and separate , it from other phases , as this contamination may deteriorate the photovoltaic properties of synthesized materials .",
    "the difficulty is that the secondary phase ( cu@xmath0snse@xmath1 , or ctse for the following ) has the same underlying zinc - blende structure ( when neglecting the difference between cations ) as kesterite or stannite phases of cu@xmath0znsnse@xmath2 ( cztse ) , hence the x - ray diffraction identification is very problematic .",
    "fortunately , the corresponding vibration spectra seem to show pronounced differences .",
    "the difficulty here is that good benchmarks which would help to pinpoint one or another phase are not yet established as such , exactly because of the difficulty to prepare , and characterize , them in a well controlled way .",
    "it should be noted that much activity in preparation of photovoltaically interesting samples occurs in thin films and not in massive bulk , so that typical problems of growth and quality control do add to the difficulty of keeping the ctse and cztse phases apart .    in this perspective",
    ", we hope that first - principles calculations , relying on unambiguous structure information , may help to pinpoint such benchmarks in phonon spectra .",
    "however , our interest is of more than purely applied character . given the overall closeness in chemistry and a tricky structural relation between the two phases , we can trace how the features of different spatial confinement emerge and give rise to different vibration motives .",
    "this may be didactically interesting , pay homage to `` percolation '' view on the vibration modes in semiconductor alloys @xcite ( ctse being a nice non - trivial natural benchmark of an ordered alloy ) , and have impact on manipulating semiconductor superstructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : structure ] briefly outlines structural relations between kesterite and the secondary phase , more details of which are put into the appendix .",
    "section [ sec : calcul ] refers to the technical side of calculations .",
    "section [ sec : optimi ] specifies the optimizes crystal structure in comparison with experiment . the main section [ sec : modes ] present the discussion of vibration features mode by mode , making reference to their counterparts in kesterite and  whenever posible  to experiments , suggesting tentative attribution of the most pronounced measured modes .",
    "the crystal structure of ctse , as reported by marcano _ et al . _ @xcite and refined by delgado _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is monoclinic with the @xmath3 space group .",
    "in fact its unit cell is a supercell of underlying zincblende structure , where two atom species occupy cationic sites in an ordered way ( cu being in two inequivalent positions ) , with @xmath4=4 , hence 12 cationic sites per unit cell .",
    "kesterite is a different ordered superstructure on the basis of zincblende , with three different cations and 8 cationic sites .",
    "the two structures are commensurate , so that doubled unit cell of ctse matches tripled unit cell of kesterite ( not stannite ! ) cztse .    the orientation of the monoclinic structure of ctse with respect to underlying cubic is shown in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "two vectors of the monoclinic basal plane , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , go as @xmath7 and are thus valid translation vectors of kesterite .",
    "the @xmath8 vector is in the basal plane of kesterite , @xmath9 , which , if starting from a cu atom in the cu - sn plane , would end at sn .",
    "therefore this vector must be doubled in order to get a structure comprising an integer number ( 3 ) of kesterite unit cells .",
    "more precisely the transformation of basis vectors is described in appendix .",
    "we only emphasize here , as was also stated by delgado _",
    "et al._,@xcite that copper atoms have two inequivalent positions , whereby selenium has three .",
    "the nearest neighborhoods of anions are ( cu1 , cu2 , 2@xmath10sn ) to se1 , ( cu1 , 2@xmath10cu2 , sn ) to se2 , ( 2@xmath10cu1 , cu2 , sn ) to se3 and ( of cations ) ( se1 , se2 , 2@xmath10se3 ) to cu1 , ( se1 , 2@xmath10se2 , se3 ) to cu2 , ( 2@xmath10se1 , se2 , se3 ) to sn . the explicit numbering and positioning of atoms is given in the appendix .",
    "the present calculations have been done from first principles , at the accuracy level provided by the density functional theory , specifically , the local density approximation ( lda ) , using the siesta method and calculation code @xcite .",
    "norm - conserving pseudopotentials constructed with the troullier - martins scheme @xcite were used in combination with atom - centered strictly confined localized basis functions .",
    "the calculation setup is identical to that used in ref .",
    "the calculations on the kesterite phase have not been re - done here , as compared to this publication , but we bring to attention some further vibration modes than previously discussed , for the sake of the present comparison .",
    "an obvious shortcoming of our calculation is the underestimation of the band gap and , as a consequence , a very limited usefulness for discussing electronic properties .",
    "however , it has been shown on many occasions that ground state - related results , such as equilibrium geometry , forces on atoms and hence phonons , are quite reliable , so that more sophisticated hybrid - functional or gw calculations are not ( yet ) prerequisite of a reliable lattice - dynamics study .",
    "as concerns the electronic structure with the accent on optical properties , the necessary information was provided by a recent work by ying - teng zhai _",
    "@xcite , who did a hybrid - functional calculation for monoclinic ctse , among other ternary structures .",
    "another limitation , that we only discuss the zone - center vibration modes , is of purely technical character and could have been overcome in our calculation approach .",
    "however , for discussing a possible impact on raman or infrared spectra , only zone - center vibrations are of interest anyway . moreover , having already a quite large unit cell of the ctse phase and hence correspondingly reduced brillouin zone , discussing dispersions of its many phonon branches would not obviously contribute any clearness to the present analysis . and finally , having different unit cells of cztse - kesterite and ctse , an attribution of their relative phonon dispersions would be not straightforward . at @xmath11 ,",
    "such comparison is easier .",
    "the internal coordinates of atoms in monoclinic ctse were given by delgado _",
    "et al._.@xcite the details on the crystal structure and its relation to kesterite are explained in the appendix ; for the present it suffices to know that the underlying lattice is a very little distorted zincblende , over cationic sites of which the cu and sn atoms are ordered .    in the course of relaxation , even as no symmetry constraints have been imposed on the lattice , the latter remained well monoclinic [ @xmath12 and @xmath13 stay at ( 90@xmath1410@xmath15)@xmath16 , yielding lattice parameters @xmath17=6.939   , @xmath18=11.950   , @xmath19=6.975   , @xmath20=109.72@xmath21 and unit cell volume @xmath22=544.45  @xmath23 .",
    "these can be compared with experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath17=6.967   , @xmath18=12.049   , @xmath19=6.945   , @xmath20=109.19@xmath21 , @xmath22=550.6  @xmath23 ( @xmath17 and @xmath19 apparently being inversed , compared to our setting ) .",
    "the underestimation of lattice parameters in lda is typical ; the present error ( 1% , for the volume ) is in fact unusually small .",
    "we note however that earlier experimental data by marcano _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath17=6.5936   , @xmath18=12.1593   , @xmath19=6.6084   , @xmath20=108.56@xmath21 ) are rather at variance with both delgado s results and our present ones .",
