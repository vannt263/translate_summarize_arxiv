    "models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking constitute one of the best motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "a sensible model building requires , however , a deep knowledge of gauge dynamics in a regime where perturbation theory fails .",
    "it is , hence , of utmost importance to gain information on the nonperturbative dynamics of non - abelian four dimensional gauge theories .",
    "recent studies of the dynamics of gauge theories featuring fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations of the new gauge group led to several interesting phenomenological possibilities @xcite such as minimal walking technicolor ( mwt ) @xcite and ultra minimal walking technicolor ( umt ) @xcite .",
    "we observe that higher dimensional representations have been used earlier in particle physics phenomenology and time honored examples are grand unified models .",
    "the initial discovery @xcite that theories with fermions transforming according to higher dimensional representations develop an infrared fixed point ( irfp ) for an extremely small number of flavors and colors has been tested using several analytic methods @xcite for @xmath1 gauge groups .",
    "the analysis for @xmath2 ad @xmath3 gauge groups has been performed in @xcite .",
    "this discovery is important since it permits the construction of several explicit uv - complete models able to break the electroweak symmetry dynamically while naturally featuring small contributions to the electroweak precision parameters @xcite .",
    "simultaneously it also helps alleviating the flavor changing neutral currents while the models also feature explicit candidates of asymmetric dark matter @xcite .",
    "these models are economical since they require the introduction of a very small number of underlying elementary fields and can feature a light composite higgs @xcite .",
    "recent analyses lend further support to the latter observation @xcite .",
    "if a theory develops an irfp fixed point then at large distances displays a conformal behavior .",
    "one can envision several ways to depart from conformality .",
    "for example one can add a relevant operator such as an explicit fermion mass term or decrease the number of flavors .",
    "if the departure from conformality is _ soft _ , meaning that the irfp is quasi - reached the gauge coupling constant runs slowly over a long range of energies and the theory is said to _ walk _",
    "this is , however , not the best way to define a walking theory since the coupling constant is not a physical quantity .",
    "in fact one should look at two and higher point correlators and determine the associated scaling exponents . in a ( quasi)-conformal theory the correlators will have a characteristic power law behavior .",
    "gauge theories developing an irfp are natural ultraviolet completions of unparticle @xcite models @xcite .",
    "the effects of the instantons and their interplay with the fermion - mass operator on the conformal window have been evaluated in @xcite . within the sd approach these effects",
    "were investigated in @xcite .",
    "non - abelian gauge theories exist in a number of distinct phases which can be classified according to the characteristic dependence of the potential energy on the distance between two well separated static sources .",
    "the collection of all of these different behaviors , when represented , for example , in the flavor - color space , constitutes the _ phase diagram _ of the given gauge theory .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath1 gauge theories as functions of number of flavors , colors and matter representation has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "interesting applications have been envisioned not only for the lhc phenomenology @xcite but also for cosmology @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative dynamics of these models is being investigated via first principles lattice computations by several groups @xcite . in the literature",
    "the reader can also find various attempts to gain information on the nonperturbative gauge dynamics using gauge - gravity type duality and we cite here only a few recent efforts @xcite .",
    "we have also extended the analysis of the zero temperature and matter density phase diagram to @xmath2 and @xmath3 gauge theories with matter in a single matter representation @xcite .",
    "an interesting universal picture emerges unifying the phase diagrams of the various gauge groups .    till now the various investigations dealt with fermions in a single representation of the gauge group .",
    "in fact these constitute only a small fraction of all of the possible gauge theories we can envision built out of fermions in several representations . a priori",
    "there is no reason to exclude these theories from interesting applications .",
    "in fact , we have very recently shown that one of these theories leads to a novel model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking possessing several interesting phenomenological features @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to initiate the first systematic study of conformal gauge dynamics associated to nonsupersymmetric gauge theories featuring matter in two different representations of the undelying gauge group .",
    "the region in flavor / color space bounding the fraction of the theory developing a conformal behavior at large distances is a three - dimensional volume .",
    "two faces of this volume correspond the the conformal areas of the gauge theory when on of the flavor numbers is set to zero .",
    "these areas are often referred as conformal _ windows_. it is then natural to indicate the conformal volumes as the conformal _ houses _ whose _ windows _ are the two dimensional conformal areas .",
    "what methods can we use to draw the boundary of the conformal houses ? the ideal , would be , to use first principle lattice simulations .",
    "although this is possible , in principle , it is simply too expensive to unveil the entire phase diagram and one can only explore a small portion of it .",
    "this is especially true for gauge theories with multiple representations given that the phase diagram is multidimensional .",
    "hence , before launching into a lattice simulation , one should have an idea of how the phase diagram looks like in order to select the relevant theories to investigate .",
    "we have considered different analytic methods in our previous studies of the conformal windows .",
    "the following table , taken from @xcite , neatly summarizes the range of applicability of the three most used methods .",
    "they are the all - orders beta function ( bf ) @xcite ; the truncated schwinger - dyson equation ( sd ) @xcite ( referred also as the ladder approximation in the literature ) ; the appelquist - cohen - schmaltz ( acs ) conjecture @xcite which makes use of the counting of the thermal degrees of freedom at high and low temperature . in the table below we compared directly the various analytical methods .     rep .  &",

    "only bf and sd provide useful constraints in the case of the higher dimensional representations as summarized in the third column .",
    "when multiple representations participate in the gauge dynamics the bf constraints can be used directly @xcite to determine the extension of the conformal ( hyper)volumes while extra dynamical information and approximations are required in the @xmath8 approach . since gauge theories with fermions in several representations of the underlying gauge group",
    "must contain higher dimensional representations the acs is less efficient in this case .",
    "these results are summarized in the fourth column .",
    "the all - orders beta function reproduces the supersymmetric exact results when going over the super yang - mills case , the acs conjecture was proved successful when tested against the supersymmetric conformal window results @xcite .",
    "however the sd approximation does not reproduce any supersymmetric result @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in the fifth column . finally , it is of theoretical and phenomenological interest  for example to construct sensible uv completions of models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and unparticles  to compute the anomalous dimension of the mass of the fermions at the ( near ) conformal fixed point .",
    "only the all - orders beta function provides a simple closed form expression as it is summarized in the sixth column .    the table above clearly shows , by direct comparison of the various analytic method used to analyze the phase diagrams in @xcite , that the conjectured all - orders bera function for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with fermionic matter in arbtriray representations of the gauge group @xcite is the most efficient method .",
    "we will henceforth use the bf method .",
    "we will then investigate the effects of adding relevant mass operators on the chiral dynamics .",
    "following @xcite we will also estimate the effects of the instanton induced interactions on the chiral dynamics .",
    "our results greatly enlarge the number of gauge theories which can be used to extend the sm of particle interactions .",
    "the conformal window of non - abelian gauge theories containing matter transforming according to a single specific representation of the gauge group has received much attention throughout many years @xcite . in the past",
    "many different theoretical tools have been developed to estimate its size and shape . by direct comparison of the predictions stemming from the various methods it has been shown in @xcite that the recently conjectured beta function @xcite for nonsupersymmetric gauge theories with fermionic matter allows for useful bounds of the various conformal windows and yields the maximum amount of information .",
    "the predictions are unambiguous and can be tested .",
    "the conjecture is non - trivially supported by all the recent lattice data @xcite .",

    "indeed the construction of the above beta function is inspired by the one of their supersymmetric cousin theories . at small coupling",
    "it coincides with the two - loop beta function and in the non - perturbative regime reproduces earlier known exact results .",
    "similar to the supersymmetric case it allows for a bound of the conformal window @xcite . in the supersymmetric case",
    "where additional checks can be made the bound is actually believed to give the true conformal window .",

    "bound @xcite , i.e. does not depend on model computations . if it turns out that dynamically a smaller value of @xmath4 actually delimits the conformal window this value must be less than @xmath28 and hence does not affect our results on the bound of the conformal windows . ]",
    "@xmath29 for a given representation this determines the critical number of color as a function of the minimum number of flavors for which an infrared fixed point can be reached . at this point",
    "one would have reported the graphical representation of the various conformal windows by keeping the number of flavors on the vertical axis and the number of colors on the horizontal axis . given that we have in mind to generalize this bi - dimensional representation to the case of one more representation it is more convenient to draw it from the beginning with the number of colors on the vertical axis .",
