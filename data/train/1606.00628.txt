    "sub - riemannian geometry is a generalization of riemannian geometry which is motivated by very physical and concrete problems .",
    "it is the language for formalizing questions like :  can we connect two thermodynamical states by adiabatic paths?\"@xcite ,  can a robot with a certain set of movement rules reach everywhere in a factory?\"@xcite ,  can a business man evade tax by following the rules that were set to avoid tax evasion ? \" ,  by adjusting the current we give to a neural system , can we change the initial phase of the system to any other phase we want?\"@xcite .",
    "however one drawback of current sub - riemannian geometry literature is that it almost exclusively focuses on the study of  smooth systems , which is sometimes too much to ask for a mathematical subject that has close connections with physical sciences .",
    "for instance , one place where non - differentiable objects appear in a physically motivated mathematical branch ( and which is the main motivation of the authors ) is the area of dynamical systems . more specifically in ( partially and uniformly ) hyperbolic dynamics , bundles that are only hlder continuous are quite abundant and their sub - riemannian properties ( i.e. accessibility and integrability ) play an important role in the description and classification of the dynamics .",

    "given such coordinates and @xmath34 , we define the coordinate weighted box as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the euclidean norm with respect to the given adapted coordinates .",
    "a specialization of the fundamental the * _ ball - box theorem _ * @xcite , says that if @xmath0 is a smooth , step 2 , completely non - integrable bundle at a point @xmath14 , then , given any smooth adapted coordinate system defined on some small enough neighborhood of @xmath14 , there exists constants @xmath37 such that for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 note that here the lower inclusion @xmath40 implies accessibility around @xmath14 .",
    "this specialized case is also known to hold true for @xmath8 bundles , see @xcite .",
    "there are several works ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that try to generalize the ball - box theorem to the setting of less regular bundles .",

    ", they generalize the ball - box theorem to hlder continuous bundles following a proof for @xmath8 bundles given in @xcite .",

    ", they prove that for the case of accessible , @xmath41hlder , codimension 1 bundle , the inclusion `` @xmath42 '' holds true with @xmath43 ( this inclusion translates as a certain  lower bound \" in the way they choose to express his results in @xcite ) .",
    "although this result does not assume any regularity beyond being hlder ( which is the weakest regularity assumption in the works we compare ) , what is lacking is that there is no criterion for accessibility and without the lower inclusion one has no qualitative information about the shape or the volume of the sub - riemannian ball .",
    "in @xcite they prove the full ball - box theorem under certain lipschitz continuity assumptions for commutators of the vector - fields involved .",

    "the bundle itself is differentiable and therefore the lie derivatives @xmath49 $ ] are defined although only hlder continuous",
    ". therefore many of the tools of classical theory such as baker - hausdorff - campbell formula are not applicable and extension of the theory already becomes non - trivial .",
    "although the case of step 2 , completely non - integrable @xmath8 bundles is already dealt with in @xcite , the cited paper considers the general case and does not only study the ball - box theorem but several other important theorems from sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "this paper makes progress toward extending the ball - box theorem to continuous bundles .",
    "we establish an analogue of the ball - box theorem ( of the step 2 case ) and therefore chow - rashevskii theorem for a certain class of non - integrable , continuous , corank 1 bundles that satisfy a geometric condition ( explained in the next section ) . in particular studying continuous bundles",
    "allows us to analyze what are the important features for giving volume and shape to a sub - riemannian ball . in the end",
    "we can conclude that certain geometric features are sufficient for obtaining lower bounds on the volume while regularity also plays an important role for the shape .",
    "the authors believe that the methods presented in this paper can become useful for answering these questions in more generality and this is discussed in section [ sec - generalizations ] .    after the proof of the main theorems ,",
    "we give examples of bundles that satisfy these geometric properties and yet are not differentiable ( nor hlder ) , we present an application to dynamical systems and we also study some interesting properties of this class of bundles and pose some questions related to possible generalizations including measurable bundles ( measurable in terms of space variables , not just the time variables which is already completely covered by classical control theory ) .",

    "the domain of the coordinate will be possibly a smaller euclidean box where we work and all the supremums and infumums of the functions defined on this coordinate neighbourhood will be over this domain . henceforth we denote the domain of any chosen coordinate system by @xmath18 . by @xmath36 , we denote the euclidean norm given by the coordinates and we identify the tangent spaces with @xmath51 .",

    "theorem [ thm - chow ] will then be a consequence of this theorem .",
    "we say that a bundle @xmath0 has modulus of continuity @xmath103 if in every coordinate neighborhood there exists a constant @xmath104 such that , it has a basis of sections @xmath105 whose elements have modulus of continuity @xmath106 with respect to the euclidean norm of the coordinates .",

    "@xmath83 stands for hourglass and @xmath119 for diamond .",
    "note that in the case @xmath120 ( i.e. hlder continuous ) the shape of @xmath121 indeed looks like an hourglass and @xmath122 looks like a diamond with sides that are bent inwards and becomes more linear as @xmath123 increases ( since @xmath124 dominates @xmath125 near @xmath126 , see figure [ fig - hourglass]).the ball @xmath127 is an analogue of the usual box in smooth sub - riemannian geometry with the exception @xmath128 direction is allowed to have its own scaling factors @xmath129 .",
    "we belive that with a careful geometric analysis , these constants turn out to have geometric significance and that is why we decided to define a more generalized ball like this .    in an adapted coordinate system with a domain @xmath18",
    ", we can also define a basis of sections @xmath0 of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 are continuous functions . if @xmath0 has modulus of continuity @xmath132 , then it is possible to show that , the functions @xmath133 also have modulus of continuity @xmath134 on @xmath18 with respect to @xmath36 , with some multiplicative constant @xmath135 possibly depending on @xmath18 and on the chosen coordinates .",
    "the assumption of non - integrability at @xmath95 would then mean that there exists @xmath136 , @xmath137 and a domain @xmath18 such that @xmath138 .",
    "therefore we also have @xmath139 we will also need to define a constant @xmath140 .",
    "this constant is later explained in lemma [ lem - gromov ] ( and the remark [ rem - gromov ] that follows ) , which is an independent lemma from @xcite ( sublemma 3.4b , see also corollary @xmath141 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally for a fixed adapted coordinate system with its euclidean norm , we let @xmath142 denote a constant such that , for all @xmath143 and for all @xmath144 : @xmath145 then , we can state the next main theorem :    [ thm - ballbox ] let @xmath0 be a corank 1 , continuous bundle with modulus of continuity @xmath132 .",

    "if @xmath0 is smooth then @xmath94 is equipped with continuous exterior differential and the non - integrability definition given in [ defn - integrable ] coincides with the step 2 , completely non - integrable case . also since @xmath153",
    ", one can check the following : @xmath154 @xmath155 so one gets in the case of @xmath8 bundles : @xmath156 which is the usual ball - box relations in the smooth sub - riemannian geometry ( apart from the fact that we use a generalized version of the usual boxes which contain and are contained in usual boxes with different constants ) .",
    "note also that if @xmath0 is a lipschitz continuous bundle then again we have that @xmath157 .",
    "therefore this theorem also says that if a lipschitz continuous bundle has an annihilator equipped with a continuous exterior differential , then the usual ball - box relations also hold true for this bundle .",
    "we also would like to note that the statement about the existence of @xmath8 adapted coordinates has a much more geometric interpretation .",
    "however we can only explain it after certain objects are constructed .",
    "this is explored in subsubsection [ ssection - spread ] ( see figure [ fig - ballbox ] ) .",
    "the smooth sub - riemannian geometry is usually shy of explicit constants and the explicit description of the neighbourhood @xmath18 for the ball - box theorem .",
    "this makes the results particularly hard to apply on a sequence of @xmath8 bundles , which might be used to approximate a continuous bundle .",
    "therefore we believe that this theorem can also be seen as a version of the ball - box theorem with explicit constants .",
    "the explicit constants by themselves are not enough however , but it is also essential to understand how the size of @xmath18 depends on regularity properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the explicit relations are listed in subsection [ sssection - fixu ] . as far as we are aware this is one of the few proofs that pays particular attention to these details .     with @xmath158.,width=300 ]      in this subsection we describe the layout of the paper and the main ideas of the proofs .    first note that theorem [ thm - ballbox ] implies theorem [ thm - chow ] therefore it is sufficient to prove the former .",
    "section [ sec - proof ] contains the proof of theorem [ thm - ballbox ] .",
    "the proof of this theorem has two main ingredients .",
    "these are the fundamental tools that we use repeatedly and are therefore are proven in a seperate subsections [ ssec - uniqueness ] and [ ssec - geometric ] .",
    "first ingredient is proposition [ prop - uniquebasis ] , where we prove that the adapted basis is uniquely integrable .",
    "this is only due to existence of a continuous exterior differential .",
    "the second ingredient is proposition [ prop - stokessubriemann ] which quantifies the amount admissible curves travel in the @xmath159 direction by a certain surface integral of @xmath85 .",
    "this again only assumes existence of the continuous exterior differential and proposition [ prop - uniquebasis ] .",
    "this proposition can be seen as a generalization of certain beautiful ideas from @xcite ( see section 36 of chapter 7 and appendix 4 ) .    then , in subsection [ subsec - ballboxproof ] we prove theorem [ thm - ballbox ] using propositions [ prop - uniquebasis ] and [ prop - stokessubriemann ] .",
    "the main idea is to first construct certain , accessible @xmath53 dimensional manifolds @xmath160 ( see lemma [ lem - propertiesofw ] ) and study how the sub - riemannian balls are spread around these manifolds ( see lemma [ lem - distancefromw ] ) .    to summarize the main ideas of the proof of theorem [ thm - ballbox ] , we can say    * the existence of @xmath85 and the condition that @xmath161 gives volume to the sub - riemannian ball . *",
    "the loss of regularity in the bundle may cause the sub - riemannian ball to bend which results in the outer sub - riemannian ball being distorted and the inner one getting smaller .",
    "the two main tools that we repeatedly use ( proposition [ ssec - uniqueness ] and [ ssec - geometric ] ) are obtained via application of stokes property , thus establishing it as the germ of many geometric and analytic properties of vector fields and bundles .    in section [ sec - continuousexteriordifferential ] , we give some examples of bundles whose annihilators are equipped with continuous exterior differentials and which are non - integrable on neighbourhoods where they are non - differentiable .",
    "we also study some of the properties of such bundles to emphasize that having a continuous exterior differential is a geometrically very relevant property , yet not as strong as being @xmath8 in terms of regularity .",
    "we compare the results of this paper to the several other results we have explained in the introduction .    finally in section [ sec - generalizations ] we sketch some thoughts on some possible generalizations that relax the conditions required for the theorems and some comments on how to possibly proceed with the proof in special cases of higher corank bundles .",
    "in the next two subsections we prove the two technical propositions : proposition [ prop - uniquebasis ] and proposition [ prop - stokessubriemann ] .",

    "we can connect @xmath14 to @xmath126 by first going from @xmath126 along @xmath455 with an admissible path @xmath181 to @xmath15 and then going in the @xmath159 direction with a length parametrized segment @xmath81 ( see figure [ fig - part2 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath588 forms a 1-cycle .",
    ".,width=200 ]    now to apply proposition [ prop - stokessubriemann ] we have @xmath589 and @xmath590 , @xmath591 which have the same @xmath123 coordinates .",
    "then @xmath592 @xmath593 also by conditions and we have that @xmath594 therefore by condition , @xmath595 .",
    "the projection of @xmath180 and @xmath181 along @xmath159 to @xmath596 formes a 1-cycle @xmath597 which has length less than @xmath598 . by the condition",
    "this is less than @xmath581 so by lemma [ lem - gromov ] , @xmath62 bounds a 2-cycle @xmath599 such that @xmath600 and which is in the @xmath601 neighbourhood of @xmath62 .",
    "we have that for any @xmath519 @xmath602 so by condition we have that @xmath603 .",
    "then , the requirements of the proposition [ prop - stokessubriemann ] are satisfied . since @xmath604",
    ", we have @xmath605 .    for @xmath346",
    "as defined above , @xmath606    since @xmath346 is inside @xmath596 , it is everywhere tangent to @xmath170 so @xmath607 .",
    "but for all @xmath367 ,    @xmath608 since @xmath391 , then for any @xmath519 we have as in equation , @xmath609 then , since @xmath610 by we get by condition @xmath611 which implies @xmath612",
    "so since @xmath613 , @xmath614    then this lemma and equation gives @xmath615 condition implies then @xmath616 so to be able to satisfy @xmath617 , it is sufficient to satisfy @xmath618 which is satisfied with @xmath619      now it is easy to prove the rest using lemmas [ lem - propertiesofw ] and [ lem - distancefromw ] .",
    "the latter one says that @xmath620 while the former one says that for @xmath621 we have that @xmath622    first we prove that @xmath623 . if @xmath624 @xmath625 , then @xmath561 and @xmath626 .",
    "this means there exists @xmath627 such that @xmath628 .",
    "but we know that @xmath629 .",
    "so @xmath630 which means that @xmath631 .",
    "now we prove @xmath632 .",

    "so we have @xmath636 and @xmath637 .",

    "therefore @xmath638 .",
    "so @xmath639 .",
    "this implies that @xmath640 .",
    "now finally we prove the statement about the existence of @xmath8 adapted coordinates .",
    "we will build the @xmath8 coordinate system using the manifold @xmath455 .",
    "note that for each @xmath26 , @xmath160 are @xmath8 surfaces given as the image of the map @xmath641 with @xmath433 and for @xmath642 , @xmath643 .",
    "define the transformation @xmath644 on some appropriately sized domain @xmath645 such that @xmath646 then , it is clear that this map is a @xmath8 diffeomorphism onto its image and takes each @xmath647 ( for @xmath425 ) to the @xmath123 plane .",
    "it also maps @xmath648 restricted to @xmath160 to @xmath649 on the @xmath123 plane .",
    "this is again an adapted coordinate system . in particular in this",
    "adapted coordinate system @xmath650 simply implies @xmath651 and @xmath652 .",
    "so we get @xmath653 and @xmath654 , which finishes the proof .",
    "in this section we first present interesting properties of the  continuous exterior differential \" object and give some examples of bundles that satisfy the requirements of our main theorems .",
    "we also discuss the relations between our theorems and the works in @xcite and @xcite . in the second part we present a tentative application to dynamical systems .",
    "in this subsection we study some important properties of @xmath655 , including of course showing that there are some non - integrable examples inside @xmath656 , so that we cover some examples that were not covered by @xmath8 sub - riemannian geometry .",
    "we start with an alternative characterization that already exists in @xcite :    [ prop - char ] a differential n - form @xmath80 has a continuous exterior differential if and only if there exists a sequence of differential n - forms @xmath272 such that @xmath272 converges in @xmath657 topology to @xmath80 and @xmath658 converges to some differential @xmath50 form which becomes the exterior differential of @xmath80 .",
    "the sufficiency part of this proposition is quite direct since uniform convergence of the differential forms involved also means uniform convergence of the stokes relation .",
    "the necessity can be obtained by locally mollifying the differential forms to @xmath659 ( where @xmath660 are mollifiers ) .",
    "then , under the integral @xmath661 ( thanks to the fact that @xmath660 are compactly supported ) so the stokes relations convergence .",
    "since stokes relation holds for every surface and its boundary , it is enough to obtain that @xmath658 themselves converge to @xmath85 .",
    "we start with two examples defined on @xmath662 and then we show how to paste local differential forms with continuous exterior differential to obtain global ones on manifolds .",
    "this is an example from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath663 be any @xmath8 function so that @xmath664 is @xmath657 . then setting @xmath665",
    ", we have that @xmath80 has continuous exterior differential @xmath126 .",
    "therefore @xmath666 and this gives us integrable examples inside @xmath656 .",
    "the following proposition allows us to construct examples that both have continuous exterior differentials and are non - integrable :    [ prop - example ] let @xmath667 where @xmath225 and @xmath140 are continuous functions that are @xmath8 in @xmath128 variable , @xmath225 is @xmath8 in @xmath668 variable while @xmath140 is @xmath8 in @xmath123 variable and @xmath421 is a continuous function which is @xmath8 in the @xmath669 variables and @xmath670 everywhere .",
    "assume moreover that for some @xmath671 , @xmath672 then , @xmath673 satisfies the conditions of theorem [ thm - ballbox ] at @xmath14 .    by assumptions on regularity of the functions",
    ", we can find @xmath8 functions ( by mollification ) @xmath674 , @xmath675 and @xmath676 that converge in @xmath657 topology to @xmath421 , @xmath225 and @xmath140 such that @xmath225 and @xmath140 s partial derivatives with respect to @xmath128 , partial derivative of @xmath225 with respect to @xmath668 and partial derivative of @xmath140 with respect to @xmath123 also converges ( to the respective derivatives of @xmath225 and @xmath140 ) and the partial derivative of @xmath674 with respect to @xmath669 converge to the respective partial derivatives of @xmath421",
    ". then we define @xmath677 so that @xmath678 by assumption @xmath272 converges in @xmath657 topology to @xmath80 and @xmath658 converges to @xmath679 then we have that @xmath680 the condition given in the theorem is then the non - integrability assumption required .",
    "now we give a simple example :    to create a non - integrable and non - differentiable example we have to satisfy @xmath681 at some point where @xmath80 is non - differentiable .",
    "consider @xmath682 which gives @xmath683 then for instance , @xmath80 ( or any of its product with a differentiable function ) is non - differentiable at @xmath684 but @xmath685 .",
    "therefore there exists neighbourhoods on which @xmath80 is non - differentiable and yet satisfies the sub - riemannian properties mentioned in this paper .    to create a non - hlder example out of this",
    ", we can replace for instance @xmath686 with the function @xmath687 ( setting it to be @xmath126 at @xmath126 ) and we have an example that is non - hlder at @xmath684 and also non - integrable .    to compare our results to the results given in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we need to work with a certain basis of @xmath0 .",
    "the most canonical one is the ones that we have been working with , the adapted basis . in the case",
    "when @xmath688 , the bundle is spanned by two vector - fields of the form @xmath689 and the differentiability assumptions above mean that @xmath690 $ ] exists and is continuous but not lipschitz continuous .",
    "if @xmath421 is non - constant then we have @xmath691 , @xmath692 and it is not a priori clear that whether if the lie derivatives can be defined since @xmath421 is not differentiable in @xmath128 .",
    "however we see that we can define it via : @xmath693= d\\eta(x_2,x_1)\\frac{1}{a}\\partial_y = -(c_x + b_z - \\frac{ca_x + bc_y - ba_z + cb_y}{a } ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial_y}.\\ ] ] one can check that this is the same expression as one would obtain in the @xmath8 case . the derivatives of @xmath421 with respect to @xmath128 disappear due to the symmetry in the vector - fields . and",
    "so if one mollifies @xmath193 to @xmath694 , @xmath695 $ ] converges to @xmath696 above since also @xmath697 and @xmath698 .",
    "therefore we obtain continuous vector - fields which have continuous exterior differentialss .",
    "this example is perhaps related to the question  does there exists carnot manifolds such that @xmath0 is @xmath8 , and commutators of its vector - fields are lienar combinations of @xmath8-smooth basis vectors with continuous coefficients ?  posed in @xcite . in this example",
    "the smooth basis vector is @xmath699 with the continuous coefficients as described above .",
    "the way we choose to define the lie brackets above is due to the fact that because of the form of @xmath193 any  loop  that we construct using their integral curve ends up in the same @xmath128 axis as the starting point and therefore the lie derivatives end up being tangent to @xmath159 direction .",
    "it is also not clear how one would go about defining the lie derivatives of arbitrary basis vectors - fields .",
    "it is also interesting to address the converse , that when can we construct a continuous exterior differential out of continuous lie brackets . for this",
    "we need to give a definition for two continuous vector - fields to have a continuous lie derivative , without using continuous exterior differentials . there may be several definitions the more geometric one being via loops .",
    "we will use another condition though .",
    "let @xmath700 and @xmath701 as before with @xmath702 .",
    "assume we have a sequence of approximations @xmath703 with any sequence of basis of sections @xmath105 that converges to a basis of sections @xmath105 of @xmath0 and @xmath704 such that @xmath705 .",
    "then , the regularity conditions we impose are the following :    * locally the functions @xmath706)$ ] converge uniformly to some functions ( which can be seen as a weaker form of requiring existence of continuous lie derivatives ) , * locally the functions @xmath707 converge uniformly to some functions ( which can be seen as a certain regularity assumption for the bundle @xmath0 along its basis vector - fields ) , * locally the functions @xmath708)$ ] converges uniformly to some functions ( this will imply that @xmath0 is differentiable along the @xmath159 direction ) .    then",
    ", the functions @xmath709),\\ ] ] @xmath710 ) - z^k_i(a^k_0),\\ ] ] all converge and using bilinearity over smooth functions , we can show that for any 2 vector - fields @xmath711 , @xmath712 converges which implies that @xmath658 converges to a differential 2-form which is the requirement for the existence of continuous exterior differential .",
    "the conditions above can be stated in a more cordinate free way as follows : there exists a smooth vector - field @xmath82 , transverse to @xmath0 such that all the derivatives @xmath713 $ ] , @xmath714 $ ] and @xmath715 exist ( using the definition above via some approximations ) .",
    "then , the 2-form @xmath85 is defined in a similar way .",
    "so this demonstrates that with some reasonable definition of a continuous lie derivative for continuous vector - fields and some regularity assumptions one can get existence of continuous exterior differential more geometrically .",
    "however the existence of continuous lie derivatives alone might not be enough .",
    "note that the last two items are required in order to define @xmath716 .",
    "but actually there is a more geometric way to obtain control over the transversal behavior of @xmath658 via contact structures .",
    "let us elaborate .",
    "assume we have a sequence of contact structures @xmath717 which approximate @xmath0 .",
    "then , the reeb vector - fields of the approximations can help us control the transversal behavior of @xmath658 .",
    "the main idea is that if @xmath718 are the reeb vector - fields of @xmath719 , then @xmath720 to start with and all the regularity assumptions above about @xmath707 and @xmath708)$ ] are not required . for certain other reasons ,",
    "one requires @xmath718 not to converge to @xmath0 in the limit however , which can be seen as a sort of non - involutivity condition that fits very naturally to our setting .",
    "therefore we then only require convergence of @xmath706)$ ] . hence in this setting existence of continuous lie brackets defined as",
    "above seems to be equivalent to existence of continuous exterior differential . at this moment",
    "it is useful to note that if we have a continuous exterior differential and non - integrability , then we automatically obtain a local sequence of contact structures that approximate our bundle .",
    "therefore it becomes meaningful to ask whether if the existence of continuous exterior differential can be completely replaced by the existence of a sequence of approximating contact structures .",
    "given the natural relation between contact structures and step 2 completely non - integrable bundles , it seems like a worth while direction to explore .",
    "so coming back to comparisons , for the particular examples that one can construct with proposition [ prop - example ] , the results of @xcite can not be applied since they require @xmath721 and @xmath690 $ ] to be lipschitz continuous .",
    "lipschitzness for instance , grants the critical property of existence of unique solutions for these vector - fields which is an essential tool in lipschitz continuous analysis and which we have obtained through more geometric means thanks to stokes property ( for @xmath193 ) .",
    "however we can not at the moment also say that our results cover all the step @xmath99 systems covered by their conditions .",
    "the conditions they have stated in their paper probably does not necessitate the existence of an exterior differential as described above .",
    "we would only have that the sequences of functions @xmath722)$ ] , @xmath723 , @xmath724)$ ] obtained via mollifications have uniformly bounded norms with respect to @xmath79 and converge a.e .",
    "we do believe that there is hope to extend the theory present in this paper to that direction though , and this is discussed in the final section .",
    "considering the paper @xcite , the step 2 case of the ball - box result given there , although can be covered by our theorem , is already covered by results given in @xcite .",
    "our main motivation here is to in fact work with non - differentiable bundles ( due to our interest in non - differentiable bundles that arise in dynamical systems ) so the results of @xcite do not directly apply to the class of examples we are interested in .",
    "however the fact that the authors there can simply work with continuous lie derivatives and still get the results for all steps is already quite remarkable and can be seen as an extension of results of @xcite to arbitrary step cases .",
    "also the existence of continuous lie derivatives is definitely related to existence of continuous exterior differentials as discussed above .",
    "therefore , in some sense , our result can be seen as a step 2 version of some of the results obtained in @xcite in which the differentiability assumption for the bundle is removed and the continuous lie derivatives assumption is replaced with continuous exterior differential assumption .",
    "now we are back to studying further properties of continuous exterior differentiability .",
    "in particular we will build examples of such bundles on manifolds and not just local neighborhoods .",
    "we now give a lemma from @xcite that is helpful in generating new examples of elements of @xmath656 from given ones .",
    "let @xmath80 be an element of @xmath725 .",
    "then , given any @xmath8 function @xmath582 one has that @xmath726 is an element of @xmath725 with continuous exterior differential @xmath727 .",
    "of course if @xmath582 is nowhere @xmath126 from the point of view of integrability this construction does not change anything since @xmath728 implies @xmath729 and similarly for being equal to @xmath126 .",
    "the importance of this lemma however lies in the fact that it allows us to paste together local elements of @xmath725 ( which were shown to exist above ) .",
    "we now explain this .",
    "let @xmath730 be a collection of local coordinate neighbourhoods that cover @xmath2 .",
    "assume they are equipped with local differential forms @xmath359 defined on @xmath731 which are elements of @xmath732 for some @xmath733 and a partition of unity @xmath734 such that @xmath735 .",
    "as a direct corollary of previous lemma ( and the finiteness of overlapping partition of unity cover elements ) we obtain    the 1-form defined by @xmath736 is an element of @xmath725 @xmath737 with continuous exterior differential @xmath738 .    of course",
    "even if every @xmath359 is everywhere non - integrable on each @xmath731 we can only guarantee that @xmath80 would be non - integrable at certain points and not everywhere on @xmath2 .",
    "this is similar to not being able to paste together local contact structures to form a global one ( in general ) .",
    "it would be indeed very interesting to have an example of an element of @xmath656 , for some @xmath2 , which is everywhere non - integrable .",
    "it would then also make more sense to generalize fundamental theorems of contact geometry to this setting . a good place to start would be anosov flows as it is known that the continuous center - stable and center - unstable bundles of anosov flows can be approximated by smooth contact structures @xcite .",
    "we now prove an analytic property .",
    "for this we define the function @xmath739 , @xmath740 where we assume that @xmath2 is compact ( or if not that we work with only compactly supported differential forms ) .",
    "the space @xmath741 equipped with @xmath742 is a banach space over @xmath743 .",
    "it is easy to establish that @xmath742 is a norm .",
    "now assume @xmath744 is a cauchy sequence with respect to the given norm .",
    "this means that @xmath745 and @xmath746 are cauchy sequences with respect to supnorm over @xmath2 .",
    "this means that @xmath745 converges uniformly to some @xmath410form @xmath81 and @xmath746 converges uniformly to some @xmath747form @xmath62 .",
    "then for any @xmath50 chain @xmath572 bounded by some @xmath53 chain @xmath140 , we have by uniform convergence @xmath748 this means that @xmath62 is the continuous exterior differential of @xmath81 so @xmath749 .",
    "finally we prove an algebraic property .",
    "[ lem - dd=0 ] @xmath750 maps @xmath741 to @xmath751 such that @xmath752 .",
    "in particular the sequence @xmath753 is exact .",
    "let @xmath80 be in @xmath741 and @xmath85 be its continuous exterior differential .",
    "then there exists a sequence of @xmath8 @xmath754 forms @xmath658 that converges to @xmath85 .",
    "moreover @xmath755 .",
    "therefore by proposition [ prop - char ] @xmath85 has continuous exterior differential @xmath756 .",
    "so @xmath757 and @xmath756 .",
    "in this subsection we give a tentative application to dynamical systems .",
    "it is tentative because although we state a novel integrability theorem for a class of bundles that arise in dynamical systems , we can not yet construct any examples that satisfy the properties .",
    "however we decided to include it in this paper first of all because it conveys the potential of continuous sub - riemannian geometry for applications and secondly if the generalizations stated in section [ sec - generalizations ] can be carried out then it will most likely be possible to improve this theorem and construct examples of dynamical systems that satisfy it .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath50 and @xmath758 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "assume moreover that there exists a continuous splitting @xmath759 , each of which is invariant under @xmath760 .",
    "this splitting is called partially hyperbolic if there exists constants @xmath761 for @xmath762 such that @xmath763 , @xmath764 , @xmath765 , @xmath766 and for all @xmath762 , @xmath767 @xmath768 and @xmath769 such that @xmath770 @xmath771 this basically means that under iteration of @xmath663 , the @xmath772 expands @xmath773 exponentially and contracts @xmath774 exponentially while the behavior of @xmath775 is in between the two .",
    "although these bundles might be just hlder continuous ( see @xcite ) , a well known property of such a system is that @xmath773 and @xmath774 are uniquely integrable into what are called as unstable and stable manifolds . given @xmath144 , we denote the connected component of the stable and unstable manifold in @xmath18 that contains @xmath14 as @xmath776 and @xmath777 and call them local stable and unstable manifolds . in general @xmath778 , @xmath779 or @xmath780",
    "maybe be non - integrable both in the case the bundles are continuous ( see @xcite ) and or differentiable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the integrability of these bundles play an important role in classification of the dynamics , see for instance @xcite .",
    "it is our aim to apply now theorem [ thm - ballbox ] to get a novel criterion for integrability of these bundles under additional assumptions on geometry and dynamics .",
    "a dynamical assumption that we will make is center bunching .",
    "conditions like center bunching appears quite commonly in studies of dynamical systems .",
    "see for instance @xcite where it plays an important role for ergodicity . a system is called center - bunched if @xmath781 .",
    "it means that the expansion in the unstable direction strongly dominates the expansion in center ( as opposed to the definition of partially hyperbolic system where one only has @xmath782 ) . in @xcite theorem 4.1",
    ", the authors prove that if @xmath775 and @xmath774 are @xmath8 and center bunched , partially hyperbolic then @xmath783 is uniquely integrable . s far as we are aware there is no general result on integrability of such continuous bundles that do not make any assumptions on the differentiable and topological properties of the manifold @xmath2",
    "( see for instance @xcite where they assume @xmath2 is a torus or @xcite where they have assumptions on the fundamental group of the manifold ) .",
    "an integrability theorem for continuous bundles that only make assumptions on the constants above would indeed be quite useful .",
    "since being a partially hyperbolic system and center bunching are preserved under @xmath8 perturbations of @xmath663 they constitute an open set of examples ( in @xmath8 topology ) inside partially hyperbolic systems .",
    "our aim is to make one small step towards an integrability condition for continuous bundles that relies only on the constants .",
    "the only place where differentiability is required in the proof of the theorem in @xcite is where certain sub - riemannian properties ( more specifically the smaller box inclusion in the ball - box theorem ) are required .",
    "thus once these properties are guaranteed then the proof easily carries through .",
    "assume @xmath758 is a diffeomorphism of a compact manifold which admits a center bunched partially hyperbolic splitting @xmath759 where @xmath784 .",
    "assume moreover that @xmath785 admits a continuous exterior differential .",
    "then @xmath783 is uniquely integrable with a @xmath8 foliation .    as in @xcite ,",
    "one starts by assuming that there exists a point @xmath14 where @xmath786 where @xmath787 and @xmath85 is the continuous exterior differential .",
    "then by theorem [ thm - ballbox ] , there exists a @xmath8 adapted coordinate system and a neighbourhood @xmath18 of @xmath14 on which every point @xmath15 on the local unstable manifold @xmath776 of @xmath14 can be connected to @xmath14 by a length parametrized admissible path @xmath788 such that @xmath789 , @xmath790 and @xmath791 . to show that this can be done , we choose first a smooth adapted coordinate system at @xmath14 for @xmath792 so that the unstable bundle is very close to the @xmath159 direction (",
    "since both are transverse to @xmath792 this is possible ) . by choosing it close enough ,",
    "we can make sure that when we pass to the @xmath8 adapted coordinates using the transformation given in equation , the unstable direction and @xmath159 direction are still close enough so that in a small enough neighborhood @xmath18 and for any @xmath793 , @xmath794 where @xmath795 . then to apply the ball - box theorem in this @xmath8 adapted coordinate system , for @xmath26 small enough",
    ", we pick @xmath796 so that @xmath797 .",
    "but the ball - box theorem tells us that there exists a length parametrized admissible curve @xmath798 such that @xmath799 , @xmath789 and @xmath790 . since @xmath800 , we have @xmath801 ( where in this coordinate system we remind that @xmath29 ) .",
    "therefore for some constant @xmath140 , @xmath802 .",
    "thus the conditions 1 to 4 appearing in the proof of theorem 4.1 of @xcite are fully satisfied and the rest of the analysis only depends on the dynamics of @xmath663 .",
    "so by the same contradiction obtained there we get that @xmath666 everywhere .",
    "then by the integrability theorem of hartman in @xcite , this means that @xmath783 integrates to a unique @xmath8 foliation .",
    "in this section we ask some questions that are related to generalizations of the theorems stated in this paper .    [ [ relaxing - existence - of - continuous - exterior - differential - exterior - regularity ] ] relaxing existence of continuous exterior differential : exterior regularity ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~            in this case we will be working with a sequence of differential forms @xmath272 and @xmath658 acting on objects from @xmath805 all of which is defined on an adapted coordinate system with respect to @xmath0 on some neighbourhood @xmath18 .",
    "once @xmath18 is fixed , one requires that its size does not change with respect to @xmath272 .",
    "that is we should be able to satisfy the conditions given in subsection [ sssection - fixu ] on a fixed @xmath18 for all @xmath272 .",
    "this is the first reason why we require non - integrality on a fixed neighbourhood @xmath18 of @xmath14 since otherwise @xmath272 could be non - integrable on smaller and smaller domains whose size shrink to @xmath126 forcing us to decrease the size of @xmath18 as well .",
    "we also see that the condition @xmath803 is important in being able to satisfy the other requirements given in subsection [ sssection - fixu ] with respect to all @xmath272 on a fixed domain @xmath18 .",
    "it has already been shown in previous work @xcite that under this condition one of the crucial lemmas which is [ prop - uniquebasis ] holds true .",
    "moreover one has that for every k - cycle @xmath82 and k+1 chain @xmath83 bounded by it @xmath806 and also since @xmath272 converges to @xmath80 and @xmath807 is uniformly bounded then @xmath808 can be made arbitrarily close to @xmath809 by taking @xmath79 large enough and hence non - zero .",
    "so one simply replaces @xmath810 with @xmath811 .",
    "although @xmath272 does not annihilate curves tangent to @xmath193 , since it converges to @xmath80 , this difference can be made arbitrarily small by taking @xmath79 large enough and the analysis will carry through .",
    "this generalization , if done , may allow one to replace the example [ prop - example ] which was @xmath812 , by a more general one where @xmath225 is only lipschitz in @xmath128 and @xmath668 , @xmath140 is only lipschitz in @xmath128 and @xmath123 and @xmath421 is only lipschitz in @xmath123 and @xmath668 ( instead of the @xmath8 assumption ) . but note that the non - integrability condition will be more tricky to check .",
    "assume now that @xmath0 is a corank @xmath813 tangent subbundle in a @xmath814 dimensional manifold .",
    "as pointed out after equation , we can still find an adapted basis @xmath193 for such a bundle .",
    "we also assume that on some @xmath18 , @xmath815 is spanned by @xmath816 with exterior differential @xmath817 . the case where @xmath818 for all @xmath819 represents the case of higher co - rank but still step 2 completely non - integrable case . in this case",
    "the transversal direction will not be one dimensional so the proof may become conceptually harder to carry out .",
    "but it seems to the authors that the main change appearing will only be the replacement of terms @xmath820 and @xmath821 with @xmath822 and @xmath823 .",
    "higher step cases might be impossible to carry out in full generality however we believe that there might be a subclass on which this approach may be generalized .",
    "assume @xmath0 is a corank 1 bundle so that @xmath824 is equipped with a continuous exterior differential @xmath825 for @xmath826 .",
    "let @xmath827 be a set of vector - fields that are inside @xmath828 and such that @xmath829 .",
    "let also @xmath44 be the usual adapted basis .",
    "then we can define the lie bracket of @xmath193 via @xmath830 = -\\sum_{i=1}^m d\\eta_i(x_j , z_i)y_i.\\ ] ] note that again by the form the adapted basis , any loop constructed from any pair of such vector - fields always stays in the @xmath128 plane .",
    "now define @xmath831 , @xmath832 $ ] .",
    "assume @xmath833 is equipped with an exterior differential @xmath825 for @xmath834 for @xmath835",
    ". then one can also define @xmath836 $ ] as above and then define @xmath837 $ ] .",
    "proceeding inductively with always the assumption of existence of continuous exterior differentials and the strict inclusion @xmath838 ( since @xmath839 ) we obtain a chain @xmath840 which terminates for some @xmath841 such that @xmath842 .",
    "the meaningful question to ask then is whether if analogues of the ball - box and chow - rashevskii theorem hold true in this case .",
    "this is very much akin to the requirements in @xcite , where for higher step cases , one requires higher order lie brackets to be lipschitz continuous .",
    "of course finding an example of a bundle that satisfies the properties above will be substantially harder , so one might first try to find such an example based on the examples given in this paper before embarking on trying to prove the generalization .",
    "now we explain a fundamentally more difficult generalization which the authors think is true but are not able to prove yet .",
    "we want to remove both the existence of @xmath85 and boundedness of @xmath843 explained in the previous section all together so that the applicability range of this theorem increases greatly .",
    "namely , assuming corank 1 , we only want to impose the following : there exists a sequence of differential 1-forms @xmath272 that converge to @xmath80 uniformly and for some neighbourhood @xmath18 of @xmath14 , @xmath844 for all @xmath33 .",
    "note that we still have one fundamental equality satisfied : for every k - cycle @xmath82 and k+1 chain @xmath83 bounded by it @xmath806 .",
    "this is of course just one important step of the analysis .",
    "we lose one crucial property , we lose the fact that the adapted basis @xmath845 are uniquely integrable .",
    "this brings about the problem of choosing certain integral curves to build something similar to the surface @xmath160 that was used in the construction of the accessible neighbourhood . at this part , in corank",
    "@xmath5 the notion of maximal and minimal solutions can be of help to determine in a well defined way some objects similar to @xmath160 .",
    "the problems do nt end here however .",
    "note that in application of stokes property with @xmath658 we will need an estimate on objects like @xmath811 .",
    "the fact that @xmath843 might not be bounded may cause problems in conditions required in subsection [ sssection - fixu ] .",
    "however it seems likely that with some restrictive relations between how fast @xmath272 converges and how fast @xmath843 may blow up these conditions can still be satisfied in certain cases . at this stage using for instance mollifications as the approximation could be useful as one can write down the relation between such terms more precisely , as was done in @xcite .",
    "although the authors are hopeful about this generalization , they are not completely sure whether if the analysis carries through or not . it will be subject of future works ."
