    "the error bars also include the 1@xmath54 uncertainties on the mass of the star ( and hence the distance uncertainty ) , on the astrometry of run  c , and on the offset due to the proper motion .",
    "finally , we have included the astrometry in runs  a and b to compute the range of possible separations between the peak of the emission and the pulsar , as shown in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "we consider all possible values of the longitude of the ascending node ( @xmath44 ) , which determines the orientation of the orbit in the plane of the sky .",
    "the radio morphology at a given epoch depends on the spatial distribution of synchrotron emitting particles and their emission processes .",
    "given the limitations of our data ( only two images , and without accurate astrometry ) , we have used a simple kinematical model to check if it can trace the extended structures detected .",
    "we have considered the shock between the relativistic pulsar wind and a spherical stellar wind .",
    "the shock is produced at the standoff distance , the region where the pulsar and stellar wind pressures balance , as described in @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the nebular flow after the shock is described in @xcite .",
    "this should be considered as a first approximation to the much more complex hydrodynamic behavior of a shocked flow in a binary system , as shown in @xcite . in the kennel & coroniti approximation of a non - turbulent adiabatically expanding flow",
    ", the flow speed depends only on the magnetization parameter @xmath54 when assuming @xmath85 .",
    "this allows us to compute the past trajectory of the flow produced behind the standoff distance , which depends on the components separation along the orbit , the mass loss rate of the star ( @xmath86  yr@xmath16 for a typical o9 star ; @xcite ) , the terminal wind velocity , @xmath33 , and the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar , @xmath14 . with these restrictions ,",
    "the only free parameters are the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath44 , which describes the orientation of the orbit , and the magnetization parameter , @xmath54 . projecting the past trajectory of the flow on our vlbi images of runs  a and",
    "b , we found that the best match with the detected morphologies is obtained for @xmath87 and a magnetization parameter of @xmath88 , assuming an orbital inclination of @xmath81 .",
    "the obtained trajectories are shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] for three different values of @xmath54 .",
    "we note that the uncertainty in the distance to the system scales the size of the contours , but not the orbit and the trajectories , which are computed in au .",
    "the range of magnetizations in the plots has been chosen to approximately show the effect of keeping @xmath89 and changing either the distance from 1.9 to 2.7  kpc , either @xmath44 from @xmath5735 to @xmath90 , or a variation of the product @xmath91 of two orders of magnitude .",
    "the parameters of the circumstellar equatorial disk of the star are uncertain , but considering @xmath92  yr@xmath16 , @xcite , and a wind velocity of @xmath010  km  s@xmath16 , the product @xmath93 is @xmath0100 times smaller than the spherical wind contribution .",
    "if this equatorial component dominates during certain orbital phases , the flow trajectory would be closer to the orbit than the dashed models in figure  [ fig : f2 ] for some specific regions of the more recent part of the trajectory .",
    "however , we do not attempt to accurately model this circumstellar disk , as its density , velocity , and crossing time are unknown .",
    "we note that the astrometric errors can be of the order of @xmath010  au ( see above ) .",
    "we also emphasize that this simple model can not account for the complex magnetohydrodynamical turbulences of the real flow and should be considered as a first approximation to constrain @xmath54 .",
    "previous studies have assumed a magnetization parameter @xmath54 of around 0.010.02 for this pulsar ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) , considerably higher than our best - fit value , although comparable lower values for @xmath54 have been suggested for other systems ( e.g. , the crab pulsar ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented in this letter show that the particle accelerator within / can produce a flow of particles emitting synchrotron radiation that can travel several au .",
    "the total projected extent of the nebula is @xmath94  mas , or @xmath95  au , and the peak of the emission is clearly displaced from the binary system orbit ( see figure  [ fig : f1 ] and table  [ table : results ] ) .",
    "similar morphologies and displacements have been found in the other two known gamma - ray binaries , and , although for smaller sizes and on shorter timescales @xcite .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on the nature of the compact object and particle acceleration mechanisms in and .",
    "although initially suggested to be accreting / ejecting microquasar systems @xcite , they are now thought to contain young non - accreting pulsars @xcite , which can explain their multiwavelength emission @xcite . however , there are three basic issues that are not well understood for and , and comparisons with / can help to clarify the situation .",
    "first , the putative pulsar properties of these two sources are unknown , as no pulsations have been detected for these systems .",
    "the lack of pulsations can be explained by the intense stellar wind that produces an extremely high absorption for these small orbits , a 3.9  day orbit with separations between 0.1 and 0.2  au for , and 26.5  days with separations of 0.10.7  au for @xcite . as a reference ,",
    "the separation for is in the range 0.913.4  au , and the pulsations disappear for distances below @xmath96  au .",
    "second , it is not clear if the massive stellar wind can confine the pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "vlbi images , like the ones presented here , can shed light on the shock conditions and geometry .",
    "third , the observed sed and variability at gev energies is not well understood @xcite .",
    "_ fermi _ and _ agile _ are observing for the first time during the 2010 periastron passage , and are providing gev data that can be compared with those already obtained for and . in this context , the high - resolution vlbi radio observations presented here establish a common link to test the similarities between the three systems .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results provide the first observational evidence that non - accreting pulsars orbiting massive stars can produce variable extended radio emission at au scales .",
    "similar structures are also seen in and , in which the nature of the compact object is unknown because the detection of pulsations is challenging .",
    "the discovery presented here for the young non - accreting pulsar reinforces the link with these two sources and supports the presence of pulsars in these systems as well . planned lba observations of during the 2010 periastron passage",
    "will allow us to provide a full comparison with the behavior observed in these sources , which have been extensively monitored during several orbital cycles .",
    "we have also shown that the orientation of the orbit and the magnetization of the pulsar can be inferred from vlbi observations of the source .",
    "several images at different orbital phases covering a wider range of true anomalies will allow for a complete modeling of the orbital changes of the extended emission .",
    "finally , accurate vlbi observations of the pulsed emission during several orbits can provide the pulsar trajectory , from which we can directly obtain the proper motion of the binary system , the inclination and @xmath44 of the orbit , and the distance to the system .",
