    "since the discovery that the star hd209458 is eclipsed by a planet in a short - period orbit @xcite it has become possible to derive the basic astrophysical properties of extrasolar planets and compare these quantities with theoretical predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the absolute masses , radii and density of the transiting planet can not be calculated directly from the transit light curve and the velocity variation of the parent star , so extra information is required in order to obtain them .",
    "additional constraints can be found from spectral analysis of the parent star or by imposing a theoretical stellar mass  radius relation @xcite , but this causes a dependence on theoretical stellar models or model atmospheres .",
    "the uncertainties in these constraints dominate the overall errors in mass , radius and density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , limiting the accuracy with which properties of the star and planet can be measured .    in this work",
    "we show that the surface gravity of the planet can be measured directly using only the transit light curve and the radial velocity amplitude of the parent star .",
    "no additional information is required and so accurate and precise surface gravity values can be obtained . as theoretical studies often supply",
    "predicted values for the surface gravities of planetary objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we propose that this quantity is very well suited for comparing observation with theory .",
    "in addition , the surface gravity is an important parameter in constructing theoretical models of the atmospheres of planets @xcite .    after deriving an equation for surface gravity in terms of directly observed parameters",
    ", we illustrate this concept by studying hd209458 .",
    "we then apply it to the other known transiting extradsolar planets using results available in the literature . the planet hd209458b is known to be oversized for its mass and to be strongly irradiated by the star it orbits .",
    "an excellent transit light curve was obtained for hd209458 by @xcite , who used the hst / stis spectrograph to obtain high - precision photometry covering several different transit events .",

    "@xmath2 the surface gravity values for these objects have larger error estimates than are needed , because their fractional radii are not available in the literature .",
    "in these cases we have had to calculate them from @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are less certain than @xmath5 because of the need to adopt an additional constraints to calculate them ( see text ) .",

    "note that these models do not include the effects of irradiation from the star .",
    "the density of a transiting extrasolar planet is often used to compare observation with theory , but is typically measured with a much lower precision than its surface gravity , given the same dataset .",
    "for example , the density of hd209458b derived by @xcite is @xmath9kgm@xmath10 . using the mass and radius given by knutson et al .",
    "leads to @xmath11ms@xmath1 , where the uncertainty has been calculated by simple error propagation .",
    "these quantities are both much less precise and require more elaborate calculations than using eq.[eq : g ] to find the surface gravity : @xmath0ms@xmath1 .",
    "we have applied eq.[eq : g ] to each of the known transiting extrasolar planets ( table[tab : logg ] ) .",
    "the resulting surface gravities show a clear correlation with orbital period ( fig.[fig : logg ] ) which is connected with the known correlation between orbital period and mass for these objects .",
    "we propose that surface gravity may be the underlying parameter of the correlation due to its influence on the evaporation rates of the atmospheres of short - period giant planets .",
    "as @xmath12 can be very precisely measured , and can be directly compared with theoretical models and used to construct model atmospheres of the planet , we propose that it is an important parameter in our understanding of short - period extrasolar giant planets . in the near future , the high - precision light curves obtained by the _",
