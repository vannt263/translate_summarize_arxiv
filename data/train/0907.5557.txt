    "just that was given by berry and klein in 1997 @xcite who found that the average of the logarithm of the transmission probability through @xmath0 slabs is equal to @xmath0 times the logarithm of the single - slab transmission probability , @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the probability of transmission through a single slab and @xmath3 denotes the transmission probability for @xmath0 slabs .",

    "@xcite , the disorder is crucial ; without it , most wavelength components would be transmitted , and the stack should then appear rather transparent , but this is not the case as a simple experiment with a stack of transparencies demonstrates @xcite .     identical slabs , each with single - slap transmission probability @xmath2 . the stack as a whole has transmission probability @xmath3 , which depends on the phases that result from the random spacing of the slabs .",

    "it is indeed common to average logarithms because they are known to be `` self averaging '' @xcite , and the exact result ( [ eq : logaver ] ) is truly remarkable .",
    "but one should realize what it tells us about the average transmission probability @xmath7 itself . as a consequence of the inequality @xmath8 the berry",
    " klein relation ( [ eq : logaver ] ) amounts to a lower bound on the average transmission probability , @xmath9 as we shall see below , this bound is not particularly tight because there is a very large range of individual @xmath3 values . in particular , we note that the ray - optics result  @xcite @xmath10 is consistent with ( [ eq : bk - lowlim ] ) .",
    "it is the objective of the present contribution to report good wave - optics estimates for @xmath11 and closely related quantities .",

    "when the averaging is carried out successively , first averaging over @xmath60 , then over @xmath61 , and so forth , finally over @xmath64 , we have an intermediate value @xmath59 after averaging over the first @xmath67 random phases ; see fig .",
