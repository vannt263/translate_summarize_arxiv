    "control and manipulation of cold atoms have become fundamentally important due to their central role in the development of nanotechnology and as a tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying macroscopic manifestations of quantum physics @xcite .",
    "it now seems feasible to control them on a @xmath0 m length - scale by utilizing microstructured surfaces  also known as atoms chips  with promising areas of application such as quantum information processing with neutral atoms , integrated atom optics , precision force sensing , and studies of the interaction between atoms and surfaces .    for this reason ,",
    "e.g. , experiments using bose - einstein condensates for measuring the casimir - polder force @xcite have been developed .",
    "typically , the dielectric substrate utilized in such experiments @xcite carries a very thin top layer of another material , generally graphite or gold .",
    "however , in explicit analytic theories , this finite thickness has often been neglected and the system has been treated as a semi - infinite half - space . here",
    "we are aiming at an approach that lets us include the thickness of such a layer as a parameter into the calculation , allowing us to obtain analytic expressions for the casimir - polder force on an atom .",
    "we are going to consider a ground - state atom close to a non - dispersive dielectric slab , which is one of the fews systems of high symmetry for that the electromagnetic field can be quantized through an exact normal - mode expansion with manageable effort @xcite .",
    "the assumption of absent dispersion and absorption is working well for all but very few systems , namely those where the atom has a strong transition very near an absorption line in the medium , which in practice is something very difficult to engineer .",
    "nevertheless , if one wishes to consider more complex systems with atoms near absorbing boundaries , the calculation will require other methods to study quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , applying such results to a particular case might require extensive numerical calculations for the case at hand .",
    "using those types of formalism , the energy - level shift of atoms due to the presence of media with diverse magneto - electric properties has been calculated for several systems @xcite . here",
    ", by contrast , we are not aiming at general expressions .",
    "the focal point of the present work is to obtain simple and practical formulae that are useful for estimates and can be applied very easily to experimental situations .",
    "the energy shift in an atom close to a dielectric slab comes about due to its interaction with electromagnetic field fluctuations , which in turn are affected by the presence of the slab .",
    "thus , a quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of a layered system is required .",
    "even though the field quantization for this system had been studied previously @xcite , we have recently re - considered the problem and provided a proof of the completeness of the electromagnetic field modes that was missing in previous works on the problem .",
    "this proof of completeness is very useful in that it removes any ambiguity in how to normalize and sum over the electromagnetic field modes , and in this way also establishes the correct density of states which had previously been a subject of disagreement @xcite .    by solving the helmholtz equation and imposing the corresponding continuity conditions at the faces of the slab , it was shown in @xcite that the field modes for this system comprise of travelling and trapped modes .",
    "the travelling modes have a continuous frequency spectrum , and are composed of incident , reflected and transmitted parts outside the slab .",
    "the trapped modes arise due to solutions of the helmholtz equation with purely imaginary normal wave vector outside the slab .",
    "physically , they come about due to repeated total internal reflection inside the dielectric , and emerge as evanescent fields outside the slab .",
    "they exist only at certain discrete frequencies which depend on polarization direction and parity and are obtained through the dispersion relations .",
    "the atomic energy shift is obtained by means of second - order perturbation theory , and involves a product of electromagnetic mode functions which is summed over intermediate virtual photon states .",
    "thus the atomic energy shift receives two quite separate contributions : one from the continuous set of travelling modes , and the other from the discrete set of trapped modes .",
    "the first is an integral over wave numbers , and the second a sum over discrete wave numbers that satisfy a quite complicated dispersion relation . in practice ,",
    "both must be considered together at all times to avoid divergent terms appearing in each separate contribution but cancelling between them .",
    "this technically seemingly hopeless task can , however , be dealt with simply and elegantly by using the summation method of @xcite , which re - expresses both the integral over continuous modes and the sum over discrete modes as a single contour integral in the complex plane .",
    "we shall show below that this trick yields a closed - form expression for the atomic energy shift and permits easy asymptotic analysis for various regimes , yielding the kinds of simple formulae that we are after for estimating the effect of the layer thickness in experimental situations .",
    "we consider a dielectric slab of finite thickness @xmath1 surrounded by vacuum , as is shown in fig . [ system ] .",
    "we assume the material to be a non - dispersive and non - absorbing dielectric , which is a simple but good model for an imperfectly reflecting material .",
    "thus the material is characterized solely by its refractive index @xmath2 , which is real and the same for all frequencies . while any real material has of course to be transparent at infinite frequencies , this non - dispersive model captures the essential properties of an imperfect reflector . in particular , it includes evanescent waves , whose absence in perfect - reflector models can be problematic @xcite .",
    "since the dielectric is homogeneous in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , the dielectric permittivity of the configuration depends only on the @xmath5 coordinate and is given by @xmath6    we assume the atom to be neutral and in its ground state .",
    "also , we shall make use of the electric dipole approximation , which is adequate because , for the relevant modes , the electromagnetic field varies slowly over the size of the atom .",
    "we assume that the atom s center is fixed at the position @xmath7 .",
    "the model assumes that the interaction between the atom and the surface is purely electromagnetic , i.e. that there is negligible wave - function overlap between the atomic electron and the surface .",
    "we shall work with an interaction hamiltonian between the atom and the quantized electromagnetic field that is given by @xmath8 which is the lowest - order multipole hamiltonian and corresponds to the electric - dipole interaction . in this equation",
    ", @xmath9 is the electric - dipole moment of the atomic electron , and @xmath10 is the transverse electric field . unlike the minimal - coupling hamiltonian @xmath11 , the hamiltonian ( [ inthamiltonian ] ) includes the electrostatic interaction between the atomic dipole and its images on the other side of vacuum - dielectric interfaces . as shown previously in a similar context @xcite , the hamiltonian ( [ inthamiltonian ] ) may be more convenient for calculations that aim to derive energy shifts in cases where the retardation of the electromagnetic interaction matters .",
    "the quantization of the electromagnetic field has been discussed in detail previously @xcite , and thus , we shall only sketch the procedure here .",
    "we work with the electromagnetic potentials @xmath12 and @xmath13 and choose the generalized coulomb gauge @xmath14 = 0.\\ ] ] furthermore , since the overall system is neutral , we can set @xmath15 .",
    "thus the field equations reduce to the wave equation for @xmath16 everywhere except right on the interfaces @xmath17 . at the interfaces we solve maxwell s equations directly by imposing the continuity conditions @xmath18 in this way",
    "the electromagnetic field modes can be written , for travelling modes @xmath19 as left- or right - incident waves made up of incoming , reflected and transmitted parts , and for trapped modes @xmath20 , as symmetric or antisymmetric waves inside the slab with evanescent fields outside .",
    "we list these modes in appendix [ app : modes ] .",
    "equipped with a complete set of solutions to the classical field equations , we can proceed to quantize the electromagnetic field by using the technique of canonical quantization , i.e. by introducing annihilation and creation operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "then the expansion for the electric field operator @xmath23 in terms of the normal modes @xmath24 reads @xmath25.\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath26 is a composite label including both the polarization @xmath27 and the wave vector @xmath28 .",
    "since the interaction hamiltonian ( [ inthamiltonian ] ) is linear in the electric field , whose vacuum expectation value vanishes , there is no energy shift to first order in @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the lowest - order contribution to the shift comes from second - order perturbation theory , so that the shift is of first order in the fine - structure constant @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given by eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) . in this equation ,",
    "the intermediate state @xmath33 is a composite state with an atom in the excited state @xmath34 and the electromagnetic field carrying a photon of energy @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , the initial state @xmath36 describes an atom in its ground state @xmath37 and the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state . in the electric dipole approximation",
    "we can write @xmath38 since the field varies slowly over the size of the atom and we can therefore assume that across the atom it is almost the same as at its center @xmath7 . with this , the shift reads @xmath39 where we have introduced the abbreviation @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath41 is a state of definite angular momentum , different components of @xmath42 lead to different intermediate states @xmath43 that are mutually orthogonal , and the shift simplifies to @xmath44 furthermore , we are going to abbreviate the moduli squares of the matrix elements of the dipole - momentum operator @xmath42 between the initial state @xmath45 and the intermediate states @xmath46 , and distinguish only the components parallel and perpendicular to the slab , @xmath47    the sum over @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ generalshift ] ) is a sum over all field modes , which , as explained earlier and easily seen from appendix [ app : modes ] , comprise a continuous set of travelling modes and a discrete set of trapped modes .",
    "the contribution from the travelling modes gives rise to the shift @xmath49 where the sum over @xmath50 runs over the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of the dipole moment and of the polarization vector that is incorporated in the mode functions .",
    "as we are interested in the change in the energy levels of the atom solely due to the presence of the dielectric slab , we renormalize the energy shift and remove from eq .",
    "( [ trav ] ) the part that arises due to the interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field in free space , i.e. the lamb shift .",
    "conveniently , this rids the calculation of any divergences , provided travelling and trapped modes are considered together ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest way to implement this renormalization of the shift is by subtracting the equivalent expression for a transparent slab with @xmath51 , @xmath52 we decide to place the atom at a position @xmath53 to the right of the slab , substitute the mode functions ( [ fl],[fr ] ) , and get @xmath54    similarly , the contribution from the discrete set of trapped modes reads @xmath55 which can be written in a more explicit form by substituting the trapped modes to the right of the slab from eq .",
    "( [ fsa ] ) , @xmath56 we note that renormalization makes no difference to the trapped - modes contribution to the shift , as the trapped modes vanish in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "the total energy shift is obtained by combining the travelling - mode contribution eqs .",
    "( [ shift - trav ] ) and the trapped - mode contribution ( [ shift - trapp ] ) . at first sight , this is very complicated , since the former is given by an integral over @xmath58 while the latter involves a sum over discrete values of @xmath59 that are solutions of the dispersion relations ( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "in addition , the shift ( [ shift - trav ] ) due to travelling modes and its counterpart ( [ shift - trapp ] ) due to trapped modes diverge when evaluated each on their own , as observed before in similar circumstances @xcite .",
    "what helps , is the observation that the reflection coefficients @xmath60 have poles in the complex @xmath58 plane at exactly the values of @xmath59 that are solutions of the dispersion relations ( [ dispersion ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the residues around those poles are such that the sum over @xmath58 in eq .  ( [ shift - trapp ] )",
    "can be re - written as a contour integral with the same integrand as in eq .",
    "( [ shift - trav ] ) .",
    "thus the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ shift - trav ] ) and ( [ shift - trapp ] ) can be combined into a single contour integral in the complex @xmath58 plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown this to be the case in connection with a proof of the completeness of the electromagnetic field modes around a dielectric slab , and we refer the reader there for details . using this method to add eqs .",
    "( [ shift - trav ] ) and ( [ shift - trapp ] ) , we obtain for the total energy shift @xmath61 with the integration path @xmath62 as shown in fig .  [ contour ] .",

    ", we sum over the two polarizations and re - arrange the cartesian components @xmath64 into parallel and perpendicular parts relative to the surface of the slab .",
    "the double integral in @xmath65 can be simplified by transforming into polar coordinates and carrying out the integration in the azimuthal angle , so that the total energy shift reads @xmath66 with parallel and perpendicular contributions given , respectively , by @xmath67 and , in turn , @xmath68    before proceeding with the evaluation of eqs .",
    "( [ i_parallel ] ) and ( [ i_perpendicular ] ) , we note that both of them are written in terms of the position @xmath69 of the atom , measured from the center of the slab . in practice , one would of course want to know the energy shift of the atom as a function of its distance to the surface of the slab , @xmath70 .",
    "writing eqs .",
    "( [ i_parallel ] ) and ( [ i_perpendicular ] ) in terms of the atom - surface distance @xmath71 gives rise to a phase factor @xmath72 which we absorb in the reflection coefficients ( [ randt ] ) by redefining @xmath73 so that eq .",
    "( [ i_perpendicular ] ) turns into @xmath74 and similarly for eq .",
    "( [ i_parallel ] ) .",
    "since the photon frequency is given by @xmath75 , one can identify branch points in the integrand at @xmath76 . we choose to place the square - root cuts from @xmath77 to @xmath78 and from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "apart from this square - root cut , the integrand is analytic in the upper half - plane and for @xmath81 vanishes exponentially on the infinite semicircle in the upper half - plane .",

    "alternatively , we can use the identity @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the fine structure constant , and re - write the energy shift in terms of the matrix elements of the momentum operator , @xmath98 in this form the shift is very similar to that of an atom in front of a dielectric half - space ( cf .",
    "( 2.12 ) , ( 2.25 ) , and ( 2.26 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , except for the different reflection coefficients in each situation .    in order to further analyse or calculate the energy shift numerically , it is convenient to transform the double integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ s_paral ] ) and ( [ s_perp ] ) into polar coordinates by substituting @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and then replace @xmath101 by @xmath102 .",
    "this gives @xmath103 @xmath104 with reflection coefficients @xmath105 and the abbreviation @xmath106 .",

    "( [ spara - polar])([r_tm - t2 ] ) .",
    "in this form the shift is readily computed numerically , as we shall do in section [ sec : summary ] . however , to extract important physics and be in the position to make quick estimates",
    ", one should investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the shift in various physically significant regimes , which we shall do first .",
    "the nature of the interaction of the atom with the slab depends on the separation between them : for large separations the interaction is manifestly retarded , but for small separations the retardation can be neglected and the interaction can be assumed to take place instantaneously .",
    "the scale on which one makes this distinction of the atom - surface separation being small or large , comes from comparing the time @xmath107 that a virtual photon takes for a round - trip between atom and surface to the time scale of internal evolution of the atom . for the atom in state @xmath41 with a strong dipole transition into a close - lying state @xmath43 ,",
    "the time scale of the atom s internal dynamics is given by @xmath108 .",
    "the ratio of the two time scales is @xmath109 in natural units , which can therefore be used as the criterion for retardation : the interaction is manifestly retarded for @xmath110 , as the atom has evolved appreciably by the time the virtual photon has completed its round - trip , and it can be considered non - retarded for @xmath111 , because the atomic state hardly changes while the photon travels to the surface and back . in terms of length scales , it is the relative sizes of the distance @xmath71 of the atom from the surface and the wavelength @xmath112 of the strongest internal transition that matter .",
    "however , the thickness of the slab @xmath1 provides a third length scale to consider .",
    "we shall now consider the various asymptotics limits .",
    "for a very thick slab , i.e. in the limit @xmath114 , we can approximate @xmath115 in eqs .",
    "( [ r_te - t2 ] ) and ( [ r_tm - t2 ] )",
    ". then expressions ( [ spara - polar ] ) and ( [ sperp - polar ] ) reduce to what they would be for a dielectric half - space @xcite . the energy shift for an atom in front of a dielectric half - space has been analysed in detail previously in both the retarded and the non - retarded limits @xcite .      if the atom - surface separation @xmath71 is much larger than the slab thickness @xmath1 then the exponentials in eqs .",
    "( [ spara - polar ] ) and ( [ sperp - polar ] ) effectively cut off the integral at very small values of @xmath117 , so that the argument of the @xmath118 in eqs .",
    "( [ r_te - t2 ] ) and ( [ r_tm - t2 ] ) stays very small throughout the whole effective range of integration .",
    "thus we can approximate the @xmath118 by its small - argument expansion , @xmath119 .",
    "this leads to significant simplifications in eqs .",
    "( [ r_te - t2 ] ) and ( [ r_tm - t2 ] ) because the square roots in the denominators drop out , and we get : @xmath120 substituting these into eqs .",
    "( [ spara - polar ] ) and ( [ sperp - polar ] ) , we can now carry out the @xmath121 integral .",
    "while elementary , this integration gives an unwieldy combination of rational functions , square roots , and @xmath122 , so that we dispense with writing it down .",
    "the subsequent integration over @xmath117 can not be performed analytically , unless we make further approximations , which we shall do in the following for the retarded and non - retarded limits .      if @xmath110 then we can apply watson s lemma to the @xmath117 integrals in eqs .",
    "( [ spara - polar ] ) and ( [ sperp - polar ] ) .",
    "so , we substitute the approximated reflection coefficients ( [ r_tesmalll ] ) and ( [ r_tmsmalll ] ) , carry out the @xmath121 integration , and then expand the integrand of the @xmath117 integral around @xmath123 , after which the @xmath117 integral over the leading term becomes elementary .",
    "in such a way we find that the energy - level shift is given by @xmath124 we would like to note that this result is valid for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , but other than that for any slab thickness @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , there is no restriction on @xmath127 , which can have any size @xmath128 or @xmath129 provided it is much smaller than @xmath130 . in this sense",
    "the notion of a `` thin '' slab is slightly misleading in the retarded regime , as any slab of finite thickness can be considered thin for large enough @xmath71 .",
    "another interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that there is absolutely nothing unusual or non - analytic about the limit @xmath131 .",
    "a calculation of the casimir - polder force using field - theoretical means and four photon polarizations in a gupta - bleuler quantization scheme @xcite has found different results for different ways of implementing the boundary conditions on the photon field , and the tentative explanation for this discrepancy , as given in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been that these different results should apply to thick and thin slabs .",
    "however , this explanation is inconsistent with our explicit results for the casimir - polder energy shift for slabs of arbitrary finite thickness .      in the non - retarded limit",
    "the interactions between the atom and the slab can be approximated as instantaneous , and the energy shift in this regime can be calculated by considering the limit @xmath132 .",

    "in order to have an independent check of our general formula for the energy - shift , which in the non - retarded limit takes the form ( [ ees - alternative ] ) , we shall derive the same non - retarded shift purely by means of a classical electrostatics .",
    "if retardation can be ignored , the energy shift of the atom is simply the electrostatic energy of the atomic dipole when placed near the dielectric slab .",
