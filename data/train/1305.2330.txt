    "from cosmological observations @xcite it is evident that our universe is currently undergoing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the nature of cosmic repulsion is a challenge for the cosmologist and the particle physicist today .",
    "a variety of approaches have been studied to address the problem , still till date there is no definite clue for it . according to the standard approach , the late time acceleration can be accounted for by supplementing the energy momentum tensor by an exotic fluid component with large negative pressure dubbed _ dark energy _",
    "@xcite , which constitutes of about three fourth of total cosmic budget of the universe @xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy which is consistent with the observations is provided by cosmological constant @xmath2",
    ". however , there are various serious theoretical problems associated to it namely , the _ fine tuning _ and the _ coincidence _ problem .",
    "an interesting alternative to cosmological constant is provided by the scalar fields .",
    "the cosmological dynamics of a variety of scalar field models has been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "though these models do not address the cosmological constant problem , they can give late time cosmic acceleration and can also provide a viable cosmological dynamics at early epochs .",
    "scalar field models with generic features like the trackers are capable of alleviating the fine tuning and coincidence problems . at present , these scalar field models are absolutely consistent with the observations but at the same time , a large number of these models are also permitted .",
    "one must therefore rely on future data which should allow to narrow down the class of permissible scalar field dark energy models .",
    "another interesting approach employed to explain the late time acceleration of the universe is to modify the gravity at large scale ( infra - red modification of gravity ) .",
    "it is well known that gravity gets quantum mechanically corrected at small scales which at present is beyond our observational reach , therefore it might be possible that gravity also suffers modifications at large scales , where it is never tested directly .",
    "the modified gravity models are either phenomenological @xcite or are motivated by the higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , any large scale modification of gravity should be capable of being distinguished from cosmological constant , should be free from ghost and tachyon instabilities and should not conflict with the local physics .",
    "a large number of modified gravity models have been investigated , among which is the galileon gravity @xcite . it is motivated by the decoupling limit of the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) model @xcite .",
    "galileon theories are subclass of the scalar - tensor theories involving only up to second order derivatives , which was originally found by hordenski @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of the galileon field @xmath3 respects the shift or the galileon symmetry in flat space time @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are a constant and a constant vector respectively . due to this symmetry , the equations of motion for the field contain only second derivatives .",
    "the galileon modified gravity can give rise to late time acceleration and is free from negative energy instabilities @xcite .",
    "galileon field in a potential is also studied and is shown to give a viable cosmological dynamics @xcite .",
    "recently the galileon symmetry was subsequently extended to the curved space time by the authors of @xcite , and was shown that the lagrangian @xmath0 @xmath7 respects this symmetry in curved space time .",
    "the sign of the terms in @xmath0 are chosen in such a way that , the effective propagator of @xmath3 is never ghost - like and hence are stable . by adding the standard einstein - hilbert term to @xmath0 , and a non trivial potential for @xmath3 , one gets a simple though rich gravitational theory , with some nice properties . in particular , in the flat space time limit and in the regimes in which the analogue of the strong energy condition is violated , the field @xmath3 moves slower than in the cousin canonical theory .",
    "for this reason , @xmath3 is dubbed as the `` slotheon '' .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the cosmological dynamics of a model based upon slotheon gravity , set up the autonomous system and discuss the existence and stability of fixed points .",
    "we study the accelerating solution and the observational constraints on the model parameters using , growth , supernovae , bao and cmb data .",
    "we also study the metric perturbations and investigate the growth history of the model .",
    "in slotheon theories , the large scale modification of gravity arises due to self interaction of a scalar field @xmath3 , which moves in a potential @xmath8 and couples with matter and metric . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider the slotheon action of the form ,    @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\mathcal{s}_m\\bigl[\\psi_m;e^{2 \\beta \\pi / m_{\\rm pl } } g_{\\mu\\nu}\\bigr]\\ , , \\label{1.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath11 is a energy scale , r is the ricci scalar , @xmath12 is the matter field which couples to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "variation of this action gives the following equations of motion    @xmath15    @xmath16-v'(\\pi)=-\\frac{\\beta}{m_{\\rm{pl}}}t^{(m)}\\ , , \\label{1.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 corresponds to the energy momentum tensor of dust like particles , radiation and field respectively , and @xmath18\\bigr]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 denotes the derivative wrt @xmath3 .",
    "it has been shown that , for @xmath20 , the time derivative of the @xmath3 field is smaller than that of a canonical scalar field with the same energy density . therefore the @xmath3 field is slower than a canonical scalar field @xcite .",
    "though due to the presence of potential the action is not @xmath3-parity invariant , yet it is free from ostrogradsky ghost problem .",
    "also the slowing of the field @xmath3 is solely due to gravitational interaction . in a spatially flat flrw background ,",
    "the equations of motion take the form    @xmath21    the equation for the conservation of energy , derived from the previous equations are @xmath22 let us introduce the following dimensionless variables @xmath23    ) , radiation(@xmath24 ) and field(@xmath25 ) for potential ( [ pot ] ) are shown here with @xmath26 .",

    "we notice that , when @xmath36 , the model is similar to the standard coupled dark - energy model @xcite .",
    "the model has the same dynamical phase plane as that of coupled quintessence except one additional de - sitter solution , for @xmath37 .",
    "this solution exists only for the exponential form of potential .",

    "in this section , we analyse the cosmological perturbation of slotheon scalar field in newtonian gauge .",
    "the scalar perturbed metric is given by ,    @xmath39    the equation for linear matter perturbation in the sub - horizon approximation is given by ,    @xmath40    where ,    @xmath41\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath42 is the gauge invariant density contrast given by @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the peculiar velocity of fluid .",
