    "during the last ten years , there has been an explosion of research on networks ( i.e. , graphs ) with static connections between nodes @xcite .",
    "this has involved a remarkable interdisciplinary effort  with physicists , mathematicians , computer scientists , sociologists , and others all playing major roles . among the most important ideas in network science",
    "is the investigation of mesoscopic network structures known as  communities , \" @xcite which are constructed from subsets of nodes that are more strongly connected to each other than they are to the rest of the network .",
    "the analysis of communities has provided striking insights into functional modules in several networks @xcite .    however , despite this wealth of attention , there has been much less research that considers communities in the more general class of networks that have time - evolving weighted links @xcite . here",
    ", we examine the community dynamics in an evolving , fully - connected fx market network over the period 2005 - 2008 ( which includes the recent credit crisis ) .",
    "the network possesses a fixed number of nodes and evolving link weights that are determined by time - varying pairwise correlations between time series associated with each node .",
    "community detection in networks of this kind is equivalent to the problem of clustering multivariate time series .",
    "time series clustering has a range of applications , including finding groups of genes with similar expression patterns in microarray experiments , and grouping functional mri time series to identify regions of the brain with similar activation patterns @xcite .",
    "again , however , there has been little focus on the dynamics of clusters .    in this paper",
    ", we present a methodology for investigating cluster / community dynamics .",
    "recently , network scientists have begun to develop techniques to examine the dynamics of communities by tracking entire communities through time @xcite .",
    "this requires a method for determining which community at each time step represents the descendant of a community at the previous time step , which can lead to equivocal mappings following splits and mergers . as an alternative , we investigate community dynamics from a _ node - centric _ perspective and demonstrate how the dynamics can affect the functional role of individual nodes .",
    "our analysis uncovers major changes that occurred in the fx market during the credit crisis , including the identification of individual exchange rates that experienced significant changes in market role .",
    "our approach can potentially provide similarly useful insights into other multivariate data sets from commerce to medicine .",
    "we construct networks with @xmath0 nodes , where each node represents an exchange rate of the form xxx / yyy ( with xxx@xmath1yyy ) and xxx , yyy@xmath2\\{aud , cad , chf , gbp , dem , jpy , nok , nzd , sek , usd , xau}. the currency symbols represent : aud , australian dollar ; cad , canadian dollar ; chf , swiss franc ; eur , euro ; gbp , pounds sterling ; jpy , japanese yen ; nok , norwegian krone ; nzd , new zealand dollar ; sek , swedish krona ; usd , u.s .",

    "an exchange rate xxx / yyy indicates the amount of currency yyy one can receive in exchange for one unit of xxx .",
    "we include gold ( xau ) in the study because it behaves similarly to a volatile currency @xcite .",
    "we define the strength of the link connecting nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 using the time series of hourly exchange rate returns @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) from the hours 07:00 - 18:00 u.k .",
    "time over the period 2005 - 2008 .",
    "the return of an exchange rate with price @xmath7 at discrete time @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 .",
    "we represent the resulting fully - connected , weighted networks by an adjacency matrix @xmath10 with components @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the correlation coefficient between exchange rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 over a window of @xmath13 returns , the kronecker delta @xmath14 removes self - edges , @xmath15 indicates a time - average over @xmath13 , and @xmath16 is the standard deviation of @xmath17 over @xmath13 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath18 $ ] quantify the similarity of two exchange rates .",
    "we use the linear correlation coefficient @xmath19 to measure the correlation between pairs of exchange rates because of its simplicity , but our methods are independent of this choice and can be employed using alternative measures capable of detecting more general dependencies .",
    "we exclude self - edges in order to deal with simple graphs .",
    "this approach was also taken in a previous study of a financial network derived from a correlation matrix @xcite .",
    "however , we note that if we include self - edges , the node compositions of the identified communities are identical if we make a small parameter change in the community detection algorithm .",
    "we discuss the community detection algorithm and the effect of including self - edges in section [ sec::comm_detection ] and in @xcite .",
    "we create a longitudinal sequence of networks by consecutively displacing the time windows by @xmath20 hours ( approximately 2 trading days ) and fix @xmath21 hours ( approximately 1 month of data ) , as a compromise between over - smoothing and overly - noisy correlation coefficients @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most prior studies of financial networks , we use recent community detection techniques @xcite rather than traditional hierarchical clustering @xcite and consider weighted links rather than thresholding them to create a binary network @xcite . in @xcite , the authors also depart from such typical assumptions in a study of communities in a network of equities",
    ". however , they do not examine longitudinal networks .",
    "dynamic communities have been investigated in biophysical data using recent methods @xcite , but our work differs by focusing on quantifying and tracking the changes in community composition .",
    "we represent each network @xmath10 as an infinite - range , @xmath22-state potts spin glass , so that each node is a spin , each edge is a pairwise interaction between spins , and each community is a spin state .",
    "we then determine the community structure by assigning each spin to one state and minimizing the interaction energy of these states , which is given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the state of spin @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction energy between spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a resolution parameter and @xmath27 denotes the expected edge weight with which nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are connected in a null model of random link assignment .",
    "the kronecker delta @xmath28 ensures that the sum is only taken over nodes belonging to the same community .",
    "we employ the standard newman - girvan null model ( or prior ) , so that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the strength ( weighted degree ) of node @xmath3 and @xmath31 is the total edge weight in the network @xcite . for the particular example network",
    "considered here , each of the nodes has the same strength @xmath32 and the same expected edge weight in the null model given by @xmath33 so the null model is equivalent to the uniform case ( with constant @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , the methods we present are general and can also be applied to networks with non - uniform strength distributions @xcite .    by tuning @xmath26 , we probe the community structure at different resolutions , with larger @xmath26 values corresponding to more fragmented communities @xcite . at each resolution",

    "nodes with high community centrality , which are located in the center of their community , have a high projected community centrality and hence are attached strongly to their community ( and can be considered to be highly influential within it ) .",

    "the mean community autocorrelation increases with @xmath100 .",
    "this suggests that nodes that are strongly connected to their community are likely to persistently share that community membership with the same subset of nodes .",
    "in contrast , exchange rates with a low @xmath100 experience regular changes in the set of rates with which they are clustered .",

    "the mean link strength remains constant through time because of the inclusion in the network of each exchange rate and its inverse but [ as one can see in figs .",
    "[ evolution](a , b ) ] there is a large variation in the standard deviation of the link strengths .",
    "figure [ evolution](b ) shows that the scaled energy is closely related to the standard deviation of the link weights .",

    "the most important effect of the credit crisis on the fx market was its impact on the carry trade .",
    "the first significant community reorganization of the crisis occurred on 08/15/07 as a result of massive `` unwinding '' of the carry trade .",
