    "in this paper , we are mainly concerned with the mathematical analysis of the evaporation of a single droplet in a gas , in the continuation of our previous work@xcite .",
    "experimental studies around this subject are of course important for industrial purposes .",
    "let us refer for instance to the works@xcite .",
    "one of our main interest in this paper is to analyze the time evolution of the droplet radius , a study that we began in our previous work@xcite .",
    "let us just mention here that the experimental evolution of this radius is well known as the @xmath0 law@xcite , where @xmath1 denotes the diameter of the droplet , see below for more details .",
    "let us recall the standard physical framework for this evolution .",
    "the evaporation of a single droplet in a gas involves simultaneous heat and mass transfer processes .",
    "in particular , heat from evaporation is transferred to the droplet boundary by conduction and convection , while vapor is carried by convection and diffusion back into the gas stream .",
    "evaporation rate depends on the pressure , temperature and physical properties of the gas , the temperature , volatility and diameter of the drop in the spray .    to fix the ideas , in the experimental study@xcite of a single droplet evaporation performed by the lcsr ( combustion laboratory of the university of campus from orleans , france )",
    ", the droplet is suspended from a silicate tube .",
    "the elliptic shape of the droplet is assimilated to a sphere of equal volume .",
    "important quantities of interest for these experiments are time evolution of the droplet radius , as well as classical quantities such as mass fractions or temperatures of the liquid and gas . in the experimental studies performed above ,",
    "the so - called @xmath2 law is used to simplify two - phase fluid models and then propose adequate numerical schemes .",
    "this law simply states that the time evolution of the radius behaves as @xmath3 in time flow , and is purely phenomenological .",
    "our purpose in this paper is exactly in the opposite sense .",
    "we start from phenomenological fluid ( mixtures ) pde modeling the drop evaporation process , compute the time - evolution of the drop radius , and then deduce other quantities of interest such as mass fractions of the liquid and gas . in particular , our numerical experiments are in good agreement with this phenomenological @xmath0 law , at least for small time evolution .",
    "our framework is therefore as follows : we consider a droplet initially represented as a single component mixture ( liquid chemical specie 1 ) while the surrounding gas at time @xmath4 is made of only one ( gas ) chemical specie , say 2 .    during the evaporation process",
    ", the liquid vapor is transferred into the gas , while by condensation at the droplet surface and then by diffusion , gas chemical specie 2 appears inside the droplet .",
    "we make the important simplification that the moving interface between the droplet and the surrounding gas ( i.e. between the two species ) is spherical , with radius @xmath5 evolving in time .",
    "let @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) denote gas density ( resp .",
    "liquid density ) , and @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) denote the gas velocity ( resp .",
    "liquid velocity ) .",
    "then , one has the classical overall continuity and momentum conservation laws    @xmath10    @xmath11    above , subscript @xmath12 refers to the gas @xmath13 or to the liquid @xmath14 , depending on whether one considers the gas or liquid.@xmath15 the state equation of the gas .",
    "let @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) the mass fractions of the liquid ( resp . gas ) obtained after diffusion of species in the surrounding gas .",
    "therefore for two species , one has     @xmath18 along with equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) , we have to add the equation giving species conservation .",
    "so for the liquid , we have     @xmath19    @xmath20 denoting mass fraction of the liquid , and @xmath21 being a continuous function modeling a friction or a resistance for the drop .",
    "we assume that the liquid speed is so small that is can be settled to @xmath22",
    ". equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.3 ] ) can then be written under conservative form as     @xmath23    or     @xmath24    in a system of particular coordinates .     if @xmath25 is a curve of discontinuity of @xmath26 , then one has     @xmath27=[u]{{dx}\\over{dt } }   , \\ ] ]    where @xmath28 $ ] denotes the jump of the inner quantity , @xmath29 is the speed of discontinuity along @xmath30 .",
    "the jump relation ( [ 1.6 ] ) is known as rankine - hugoniot condition .",
    "it merely means that discontinuities can not be completely arbitrary .",
    "the above considerations are all classical facts@xcite .     in the case of our droplet , in order to find interface condition at the droplet surface , i.e. for @xmath31 , it is sufficient to use ( [ 1.5 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 ] ) in polar coordinates , getting     @xmath32=[\\rho   \\ ; \\tilde g]{{dr}\\over{dt } }   .\\ ] ]    thus taking @xmath33 , one has     @xmath34 that is also with @xmath35     @xmath36    taking @xmath37 in ( [ 1.7 ] ) , @xmath38 denoting the mass fraction of the liquid or the gas after diffusion , we get     @xmath39 and this is equivalent to     @xmath40    above @xmath41(resp.@xmath42 ) is the speed of specie @xmath43 ( resp.@xmath44 ) , @xmath45     combining relation ( [ 1.9 ] ) with fick s law@xcite , that is     @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 being diffusion coefficients , and with equations relating the thermodynamic state at the interface @xmath31     @xmath49 we obtain , for the mass fraction of the liquid @xmath50 , the boundary condition     @xmath51    using polar coordinates .     in our previous work@xcite",
    ", we have made huge mathematical and physical simplifications taking the state equation of the gas @xmath15 as constant in ( [ 1.2 ] ) , and considering gas velocity @xmath8 as a given function of the time @xmath52 .",
    "thus in our previous work , system ( [ 1.1 ] ) , ( [ 1.2 ] ) was reduced to equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) with a given @xmath53 .     in the present work , we consider the full hyperbolic system ( [ 1.1 ] ) , ( [ 1.2 ] ) with an auxiliary state equation for the gas given by @xmath54 .",
    "this of course extends our previous work , but considering such pressure laws has the advantage that we have been able to perform numerical comparisons .",
    "more general state laws will be studied in a future work .",
    "once @xmath55 and @xmath56 determined , radius @xmath57 of the drop suspended in the gas will be computed through the ordinary differential equation ( [ 1.8 ] ) .",
    "then we shall determine the mass fraction @xmath50 of liquid after evaporation process , through the pde ( [ 1.3 ] ) along with boundary condition ( [ 1.10 ] ) , for a given suitable function @xmath21 .",
    "for this last purpose , within the framework of weighted sobolev spaces on initial data and for some continuous function @xmath21 subject to increasing condition , we shall provide an unique local solution for the mass fraction @xmath50 of the liquid .",
    "in addition , we shall show that if the initial condition is bounded , then so is our solution .     in the numerical applications ( 2nd example )",
    "we have chosen the experimental conditions made by the lcsr in the study of single drop evaporation and in this case the study of the radius of the drop shows us that the graphic associated to our mathematical model presents the same features as in the experimental curves .",
    "* plan of the paper : * in section 2 , by using riemann invariants , we determine the droplet radius .",
    "this enables to get , in section 3 , the liquid mass fraction , using a variational method .",
    "finally , we have presented some numerical simulations in the last section , which shows that our model is is good agreement with experimental simulations , at least for short time .",
    "the gas velocity @xmath56 and its density @xmath55 satisfy the following system , using polar coordinates     @xmath58    setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we have     @xmath61    where @xmath62 is an auxiliary function connected to the state equation of the gas @xmath63 , by @xmath64 in ( 2.2 ) , according to the discussion in the introduction , we choose the auxiliary function @xmath62 as @xmath65=@xmath66 .    with this choice , we get the following system     @xmath67    we note that ( [ 2.3 ] ) is equivalent to matrix form    @xmath68    @xmath69 being the @xmath70 matrix     @xmath71 eigenvalues of @xmath69 ( characteristics speeds ) are given @xmath72 and @xmath73 . since @xmath74 , system ( [ 2.4 ] ) is therefore hyperbolic .",
    "thus there exists two functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( riemann invariants ) such that     @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath75 is determined by the system @xmath79 , vector @xmath80 being and eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue @xmath81 . thus     @xmath82    similarly , the riemann invariant @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath83 is given by     @xmath84    functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 satisfy the following system , equivalent to system ( [ 2.4 ] )     @xmath87    where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are given by     @xmath90    as follows from ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that a sufficient condition in order that ( [ 2.9 ] ) is authentically nonlinear is that @xmath91 and @xmath92 , which is the case here according to ( [ 2.10 ] ) .",
    "integration along the characteristics defined by     @xmath93 gives     @xmath94    therefore , the solution of the initial value problem     @xmath95    can be written as     @xmath96    where @xmath97 .",
    "similarly we have     @xmath98    where     @xmath99 the above considerations lead to the following    [ prop1 ] assume that @xmath100or @xmath101",
    ". then solution of system ( 2.3 ) is defined on a finite interval @xmath102 .",
    "proof : differentiation of ( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.11 ] ) with respect to @xmath103 gives     @xmath104    and in the same way     @xmath105    since @xmath106 and @xmath107 , from ( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) , integrating w.r.t .",
    "@xmath52 along the characteristics yields     @xmath108    @xmath109    from ( [ 2.17 ] ) , it follows that @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "similarly @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "hence @xmath114 becomes infinite for @xmath115 , since @xmath116     from proposition [ prop1 ] , it follows that    [ prop - rajout1 ] system ( [ 2.9 ] ) admits an unique @xmath117 solution on @xmath102 , for all @xmath118 and for initial data @xmath119 and @xmath120 belonging to @xmath121 .",
    "concerning the droplet radius , it follows from ( [ 1.8 ] ) , that we have the following ode for this radius @xmath122 we immediately deduce    [ prop - rajout2 ] the cauchy problem ( 2.19 ) has an unique solution @xmath57 on a maximal time interval @xmath123 with @xmath124 , given initial data @xmath125 and @xmath126 such that @xmath127 or @xmath128 .",
    "the liquid mass fraction @xmath50 satisfies the conservation equation of specie ( [ 1.3 ] ) , which can be rewritten as     @xmath129    we have used polar coordinates , and taken the diffusion constant @xmath47 as being equal to 1 .",
    "of course , ( [ 3.1 ] ) is equivalent to     @xmath130    where @xmath131 denotes the droplet radius determined in section 2 .",
