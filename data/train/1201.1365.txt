    "nucleation is a very basic phenomenon which plays a vital role in various materials processing ranging from steel production to food beverage industries  @xcite . recently ,",
    "researchers interests have turned to complex material nucleations which are relevant to our daily life  @xcite .",
    "the nucleation of such complex materials can also be complex and may consist of multiple steps  @xcite .",
    "these multiple steps correspond to the multiple saddle points on the free energy landscape and can occur in series or in parallel .",
    "therefore , the nucleation with multiple steps can be akin to the text - book problem of electric circuitry .",
    "the most basic unit of electric circuitry is the parallel or series connections of two resistors . likewise , there are some problems of nucleation where there are two saddles points on the free - energy landscape . for example ,",
    "ray et al .",
    "@xcite found the two saddle points ( double barriers ) on the two - dimensional free - energy landscape of a droplet condensation of binary vapor  @xcite .",
    "a sequential two saddle points on the free - energy landscape along a fictitious one - dimensional reaction coordinate has been studied by valencia and lipowsky  @xcite to study the condensation on a patterned substrate .",
    "these free - energy landscapes imply two successive _ series _ nucleations .",
    "a similar double - barrier model was assumed to study the nucleation and growth by various authors  @xcite when an intermediate metastable phase exists .",
    "recently , the present author  @xcite re - examined the free - energy landscape using capillarity approximation when an intermediate metastable phase existed .",
    "the location of the two saddle points on the free - energy landscape seems to suggest a _",
    "parallel _ nucleation in contrast to the assumption of a _ series _ nucleation of previous authors  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1x ] shows the free - energy landscape when two saddle points have the same free - energy barrier  @xcite .",
    "the two red points indicate two saddle points and the red line indicates the series nucleation route assumed by previous authors  @xcite .",
    "this figure clearly suggests a parallel nucleation with two nucleation routes which pass through two different saddle points .",
    "similar free - energy landscapes with two types of critical nucleus of different compositions have been predicted by ray et al .",
    "@xcite for partially miscible binary systems such as diethylene glycol/_n_-heptane , methanol / cyclohexane and diethlene glycol / benzen from the free - energy calculation using the capillarity approximation , and by chen et al .",
    "@xcite for water/_n_-nonane mixtures using monte carlo algorithm with the umbrella sampling technique .",
    "experimental result for the water/_n_-nonane mixture by wagner and strey  @xcite is also consistent to the picture of parallel nucleation with two saddle points .",

    "this is calculated using the capillarity approximation  @xcite in the ( metastable liquid ( @xmath0 ) , stable solid ( @xmath1))-space .",
    "the two red points indicate two saddle points with the same free - energy barriers which correspond to the critical nucleus of metastable liquid and the critical composite nucleus composed from solid core and surrounding metastable liquid wetting layer .",
    "the red line indicates the series nucleation route suggested by previous authors  @xcite .",
    "this free - energy landscape with two saddle points clearly indicates a parallel nucleation ( two nucleation routes ) . ]    in this report , we consider the most basic elements of complex nucleation . a series and a parallel nucleation , which are akin to the basic units of electric circuit : series and parallel connection of resistors or conductors .",
    "we summarize the basic ingredients of the parallel and the series nucleations and emphasize the complex nucleation process which could be sorted out by mapping the complex nucleation process into a simple electric circuitry .",
    "nucleation kinetics can be studied using the discrete or continuum descriptions  @xcite . in this report",
    ", we use the continuum description since we want to make correspondence to the classical electrostatics more transparent . in the continuum description ,",
    "the discrete master equation is transformed into the fokker - planck equation  @xcite or so - called zeldovich - frenkel equation  @xcite for the one - component system .",
    "we start from the general fokker - planck equation for the multi - component system  @xcite of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of clusters with composition @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the nucleation flux vector @xmath6 where @xmath7 are unit vectors in the cartesian @xmath8 coordinate . by assuming the detailed balance at the equilibrium  @xcite , the flux components @xmath9 are derived from the potential @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the equilibrium number of clusters and @xmath13 is the reversible work ( free - energy ) of cluster formation with composition @xmath14 .    using the potential @xmath10 , we can write the nucleation flux as @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the reaction rates of nucleation which will take different forms in vapor condensation  @xcite and nucleation in condensed phase  @xcite . equations ( [ eq:1x ] ) and ( [ eq:6x ] ) lead to the fokker - planck equation  @xcite or frenkel - zeldovich  @xcite equation when we consider only one component .",
    "therefore , we have to investigate the brownian motion on a multi - dimensional surface of the potential @xmath10 .",
    "since we are interested in the series and parallel nucleation phenomena , which are the most basic elements of complex nucleation , we consider the nucleation by a two - dimensional potential @xmath17 , or the binary nucleation of two - component system that has been considered thoroughly  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the steady - state nucleation rate only though previous authors  @xcite were interested mostly in the relations between the nucleation current , the steepest - descent direction of the free energy landscape ( work of formation ) and the gradient direction of the potential @xmath10 .      in the two - dimensional space @xmath18 , we have to solve the fokker - planck equation : @xmath19 subject to the boundary condition  @xcite @xmath20 the steady - state nucleation flux @xmath21 can be studied when @xmath22 , which leads to @xmath23 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:7x ] ) . since @xmath24 , in arbitrary closed region on the two - dimensional space @xmath18",
    ", the flux must be conserved . in other words , the flux coming into this region must be balanced to the flux going out from this region .",
    "it is customary to assume the nucleation flux flow through the saddle point of the free - energy landscape @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "suppose we have two saddle points , say @xmath26 and @xmath27 whose positions are almost in parallel along the line @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the two saddle points correspond to the two types of nucleus of almost the same size and with different composition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x](a ) .",
    "in such a case , it is reasonable to assume the nucleation flux @xmath21 will fork into two branches @xmath29 that passes through the saddle point @xmath26 and @xmath30 that passes trough @xmath27 as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x](a ) , and the flux far from the two saddle points becomes the sum of the two fluxes @xmath31 where these two fluxes satisfy the conservation law @xmath32 independently around the two saddle points @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this simple equation ( [ eq:10x ] ) which represents the superposition of two independent nucleations has already been suggested and used by wagner and strey  @xcite to explain their experimental result of nucleation in water/_n_-nonane vapor mixture .",
    "general solutions for the steady - state nucleation rate at the saddle point were given by trinkaus  @xcite .",
    "first of all , we expand the work of formation @xmath33 around the saddle points @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the free - energy barrier at the saddle point @xmath37 and @xmath38 however , the steepest - descent direction of neither the free - energy landscape  @xcite @xmath13 nor the potential landscape @xmath10 does not necessarily tell you the direction of nucleation flux since the reaction rate @xmath16 can be different  @xcite @xmath39 .    in order to take into account the anisotropy of @xmath40 , according to trinkaus  @xcite and wilemski  @xcite , we introduce new variables @xmath41 through @xmath42 at each saddle point @xmath37 , where @xmath43 are the reaction rates at the two saddle points .",
    "then the free energy eq .",
    "( [ eq:12x ] ) takes the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 includes the information of not only the free energy landscape @xmath13 but also the reaction rates @xmath40 . by diagonalizing eq .",
    "( [ eq:18x ] ) as @xmath46 using the orthogonal transformation  @xcite @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 we can obtain the eigenvalues @xmath50 and @xmath51 given by @xmath52 then , the magnitude of the steady - state nucleation rate @xmath53 at the saddle point @xmath54 is given simply by @xmath55 using the eigenvalues @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the total nucleation rate can be calculated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10x ] ) and ( [ eq:26x ] ) .",
    "therefore , the total nucleation rate will be larger than the individual nucleation rates @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the extra channel of nucleation reaction exists .    since @xmath58",
    ", the two fluxes @xmath56 and @xmath57 will contribute almost equally when the free - energy barriers @xmath59 are almost the same magnitude .",
    "an example of the free - energy landscape when two saddle points have the same free - energy barriers has already be shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1x ] .    even when two competitive routes @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not have the same free energy barriers , the corresponding two competitive nuclei nucleate probabilistically .",
    "a qualitatively similar conclusion was reached by sanders et al .",
    "@xcite using the artificially designed _ q_-states potts model .",
    "the probability is in fact proportional to the boltzmann factor @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( [ eq:26x ] ) .",
    "when two saddle points @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear sequentially along the line which is almost perpendicular to the line @xmath28 , these two saddle points corresponds to the two types of nucleus of almost the same composition @xmath63 with different sizes ( small and large ) . in such a case ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the nucleation flux @xmath5 will remain one stream as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2x](b ) and the problem will be reduced to the one - dimensional double - barrier  @xcite problem shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3x ] .",
    "when there exist two saddle points @xmath64 and @xmath65 along the fictitious one - dimensional axis @xmath66 shown schematically in fig .  [ fig:2x](b ) . ]    by changing the coordinate system along the flux , the problem can be mapped to the one dimensional problem with two barriers first studied by valencia and lipowsky  @xcite .",
    "suppose we map the nucleation flux on the two - dimensional coordinates system @xmath18 to one dimensional system with coordinate @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2x](b ) ) , then the nucleation flux eq .",
    "( [ eq:6x ] ) becomes one - dimensional @xmath67 where we have used the definition of the potential @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4x ] ) and introduced an effective reaction rate @xmath68 . in the steady state ,",
    "the nucleation flux is constant @xmath69 and we have @xmath70 from eq .",

    "the factor @xmath76 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq:33x ] ) of one - dimensional problem in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eq:26x ] ) of two - dimensional problem since the general formula for the nucleation rate by trinkaus  @xcite for the @xmath77-dimensional free - energy surface is proportional to a factor @xmath78 .",
    "( [ eq:31x ] ) was initially derived by valencia and lipowsky  @xcite using the master equation and later re - derived by valencia  @xcite using the kramers theory . here",
    ", we have directly used the continuum description and the fokker - planck equation .",
    "reduction of the nucleation rate @xmath79 from an independent @xmath80 is due to the escape flow from intermediate well ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3x ] )  @xcite .",
    "the double - barrier problem was also studied using kramers theory by nicolis and nicolis  @xcite .",
    "since they did not use the standard theory of nucleation based on the fokker - planck or the zeldovich - frenkel equation , they could not derive a simple expression for the total nucleation rate like eq .",
    "( [ eq:31x ] ) .",
    "in this report , we have summarized the basic ingredients of parallel and series nucleation when there exist two saddle points on the free - energy landscape .",
    "extension to the more complex nucleation process is possible by drawing the diagram similar to the electric circuitry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4x ] .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of complex nucleation when there are three saddle points on the free energy landscape . in this case",
    ", the steady - state nucleation rate will be calculated from @xmath81 extension to more complex situation is obvious .",
    "however , it must be noted , our analysis is completely confined to the steady - state process .",
    "therefore , transient properties are out of our scope , which can only be studied numerically by solving coupled master equation  @xcite .",
    "also , our analysis assumed that the nucleation flux goes through the saddle point .",
    "saddle point avoidance  @xcite will be important if the anisotropy of the reaction matrix @xmath40 is large or the ridge between the saddle points is law , which can occur at high temperatures or near the spinodal point .",
    "in such a case , ridge - crossing rather than saddle - crossing may occur . then the nucleation flux will spread over the whole phase space and our description may break down .",
