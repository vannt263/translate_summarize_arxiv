    "the @xmath0-state potts model has the hamiltonian @xmath2 where the @xmath3s take one of the integer values from @xmath4 to @xmath0 and the sum @xmath5 is over neighbouring nodes . here",
    "the applied magnetic field @xmath6 acts on the ( arbitrarily chosen ) state @xmath4 .",
    "the partition function is then : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 being boltzmann s constant and temperature respectively .",
    "the local magnetisation @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where the angled brackets denote the gibbs average .",
    "the total magnetisation is then the average of @xmath13 over all nodes .",
    "we are interested in the potts model on a ( connected ) random graph of @xmath15 nodes with specified degree distribution @xmath16 .",
    "these are locally tree - like graphs in the sense that the sub - network of all nodes at a distance less than @xmath17 steps from any particular root node is very similar to a tree , for small @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , this is true for @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the diameter of the network , which is known @xcite to behave as @xmath20 if the second moment of @xmath16 is finite and @xmath21 if the second moment diverges , but the first is finite .",
    "the strategy of the solution relies on the following idea : we take a particular site as the root and show that its statistical properties can be derived from those of their neighbors . in turn , the properties of the neighbors are defined by those of second neighbors and so on . as long as the graph is tree - like , i.e. for distances @xmath22 from the root , the statistical properties of the sites involved in the @xmath23 iteration  those at distance @xmath24 from the root ",
    "are independent , and are captured by a simple transfer matrix . if this transfer matrix has a fixed point , the statistical properties of bulk nodes will be described by the fixed point irrespective of the boundary conditions which are set at the leaves of the tree ( i.e. at distance @xmath25 ) .",
    "this will be true , in particular , if the boundary conditions are drawn from the fixed point distribution which describes the statistics of bulk sites .",
    "notice that this argument requires the diameter over which the network is tree - like be much larger than the correlation length over which the transfer matrix converges .",
    "hence for finite graphs we expect the local tree approximation to perform poorly for graphs with @xmath26 and also close to the critical point where the convergence of the iterative process is slowed down .    for a tree , following the notations of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can solve @xmath27 iteratively , we define @xmath28 where the sum over @xmath29 and @xmath30 is _ only _ over nodes in the sub - tree whose root node is @xmath31 , including @xmath31 .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "likewise , we can define the quantity @xmath35 for any node @xmath31 at a distance @xmath24 from the root , as the partial sum of the partition function on the sub - tree ensuing from that node , where @xmath36 is the value of the spin at distance @xmath37 where the sub - tree is connected .",
    "this satisfies the recursion relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the degree of node @xmath40 .",
    "notice that @xmath41 depends on the value of the spin @xmath36 at the previous level .",
    "writing down these equations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 and taking the ratio one finds an iterative equation for    @xmath44    which reads @xmath45 in principle @xmath46 should depend on @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ leaf ] ) .",
    "however it is easy to see that @xmath46 is independent of @xmath47 if the node @xmath40 is a leaf of the tree . because all @xmath46 can be computed recursively with eq .",
    "( [ fk ] ) from the leaves back to the root then @xmath46 is independent of @xmath48 for all nodes .    from here , making the change of variables @xmath49 , dorogovtsev et .",
    "@xcite noted that the only dependence on @xmath50 in the right hand sides of equations ( [ m0eqn],[fk ] ) was from a sum over the independent @xmath51s .",
    "they thus made the approximation @xmath52    it is possible instead to solve for the distribution of @xmath50 values in the steady state .",
    "let @xmath53 be the distribution density of @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "this distribution satisfies @xmath56\\ ] ] where @xmath57\\ ] ] and @xmath58 is the distribution of @xmath50 on the neighbours of a node , @xmath59 being the distribution of degrees of neighbours of a node . averaging over @xmath60",
    "we find a recursion relation for the distribution of fields at the neighbour of a node , @xmath61 @xmath62\\ ] ] well inside the bulk of the tree , we expect that @xmath63 independent of @xmath24 .",
    "once @xmath64 is found , the distribution of local fields on any site with degree @xmath65 is given by eq .",
    "( [ rhohk ] ) .",
    "a simple way to solve equation ( [ trho ] ) numerically is the following : start from a population @xmath66 , @xmath67 of @xmath68 values of @xmath50 . evolve the population by iteration with the following procedure :    * draw at random @xmath65 from the distribution @xmath60 * draw @xmath69 values of @xmath50 at random from the population @xmath70 and sum them to get @xmath71 . *",
    "replace a random member of the population by @xmath72    iterate until convergence .",
    "the magnetisation is then found by averaging the local magnetisations on many nodes ,    * draw @xmath65 from @xmath16 * draw @xmath65 values of @xmath50 from @xmath64 and sum them to get @xmath71 and insert this into@xmath73    iterate many times and average the results to get @xmath74 .",
    "by contrast , the approximation of dorogovtsev et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "gives : @xmath75 to find the general @xmath74 these two equations are also solved numerically , albeit for only one value of @xmath50 rather than a whole population .",
    "in the following we compare the results of our method with that of dorogovtsev et .",
    "with simulations .",
    "in particular , for zero applied field ( @xmath76 ) , we study the @xmath77 state potts model on random graphs with degree distributions @xmath16 that are bimodal or truncated power law , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the normalisation .    the random graphs for the simulations are produced in the following way : @xmath15 nodes @xmath31 are given degrees @xmath80 drawn from @xmath16 , if @xmath81 is odd then a randomly chosen node has its degree increased by @xmath4",
    ". nodes of degree @xmath65 are imagined to have @xmath65 unconnected ends .",
    "next , pairs of ends are chosen at random and linked iff they belong to different nodes which are not already linked .",
    "this is repeated until no unconnected ends remain , in the unlikely event that there remain unconnected ends at nodes which are already joined , the degree of these nodes is reduced .",
    "the graph is then ` shuffled ' by picking two links , @xmath82 , @xmath83 at random and changing it to either @xmath84 , @xmath85 or @xmath86 , @xmath87 with equal probability .",
    "this is repeated until on average each link has been rewired @xmath88 times .",
    "this shuffling is intended to remove any bias due to not allowing multiple linkings @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16s are chosen so that there exists a large connected component ( giant component ) containing almost all nodes , nodes not in the giant component are discarded when calculating the magnetisation since the solution methods described above are for the giant component only .",
    "network creation took insignificant time in comparison to simulation of the potts model .",
    "the potts model is simulated using the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite .",
    "system sizes of @xmath89 @xmath90 were easily simulated and were sufficient to allow comparison with the solutions described above .     for the @xmath77 potts model on a random graph with bimodal degree distribution ( see equation ( [ pofkbim ] ) ) with @xmath91 .",
    "crosses are simulations for @xmath92 realisations of a network with @xmath89 nodes , starting from an initially fully magnetised state .",
    "lines are the results of the @xmath92 methods described , the method introduced here agreeing with simulations to high accuracy .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath93 is the transition from the metastable unmagnetised state to the magnetised state , both methods giving the same value of @xmath94 .",
    "[ bimodalmvst ] ]     for the @xmath77 potts model on a random graph with power - law degree distribution ( see equation ( [ pofkpow ] ) ) with @xmath91 , @xmath95 ( rightmost curves ) and @xmath96 ( leftmost curves ) , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "crosses are simulations for @xmath92 realisations of a network with @xmath99 nodes , starting from an initially fully magnetised state .",
    "lines are the results of the @xmath92 methods described , the solid curves are the method introduced here , the dotted lines are the method of dorogovtsev et .",
    "the vertical lines are the transition from the metastable unmagnetised state to the magnetised state , both methods giving the same value of @xmath94 .",
    "[ powerlawgammais4mvst ] ]    in figure [ bimodalmvst ] we show the results for magnetisation of the bimodal graph as a function of temperature .",
    "this case was chosen specifically because the approximation of dorogovtsev et .",
    "al . would perform poorly due to the small degree ( @xmath92 ) of half of the nodes and the large separation of the degrees ( @xmath100 ) . as expected , the method of dorogovtsev et .",
    "al . gives an incorrect result for the magnetisation although it s value for the transition temperature @xmath101 is surprisingly close to the correct value .",
    "figure [ powerlawgammais4mvst ] shows the results for the power law case with exponents @xmath95,@xmath102 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in practice",
    "the expected number of nodes with @xmath103 is less than @xmath4 for @xmath99 and increasing @xmath98 does not appreciably change the results of our method .",
    "again , the method of dorogovtsev et .",
    "al . differs from the one introduced here and from the simulations . in particular , the transition temperature is incorrect by @xmath104 .",
    "the simulations do not agree quite as well with our solution as for the bimodal case , particularly near to the transition temperature .",
    "this is expected because , as mentioned earlier , the convergence of the iterative procedure slows down close to the transition .",
    "a signature of this is that even with such large system sizes , the curves obtained for two different realizations of the graph differ slightly .",
    "in addition , the agreement improves as @xmath15 increases up to @xmath90 .    also shown in figures ( [ bimodalmvst],[powerlawgammais4mvst ] )",
    "is the transition from the metastable unmagnetised state at a temperature @xmath94 less than @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath94 can be found exactly @xcite @xmath105 for the continuous transitions , i.e. for @xmath106 , there is no metastable region and so @xmath107 and thus the method of dorogovtsev .",
    "al . gives @xmath101 exactly .",
    "for these results we have used population sizes of @xmath108 and , near @xmath101 , @xmath109 . near @xmath101 and @xmath94",
    "@xmath110 iterations per member of the population were used to ensure convergence , less elsewhere . between @xmath101 and @xmath94",
    "the magnetisation found depends on the initial values of @xmath51 , we started from both @xmath111 and @xmath112 , with a slight spread in the distribution of @xmath51 values .",
    "the timescales to produce a full @xmath74 curve using a standard pc were of the order of minutes for the method of dorogovtsev et .",
    "al . and hours for the method described here .",
    "in figures ( [ distributionsofhandx ] ) we show the distributions of the effective fields @xmath113 on neighbouring nodes at various temperatures below the phase transition .",
    "it is clear that , except in the fully magnetised or unmagnetised states , there is a wide spread of local field values .",
    "in particular , for the bimodal case , the plateau at @xmath114 is because the @xmath115 nodes are unmagnetised whilst the @xmath116 nodes remain magnetised .",
    "this is also consistent with the form of the @xmath74 curve in figure ( [ bimodalmvst ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ distributionsofhandx ] ) shows the temperature dependence of the relative spread of local fields , defined as the ratio between the standard deviation @xmath3 of the effective fields on neighbouring sites @xmath51 divided by @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "this is non - zero below the phase transition , and it attains a maximal value at the phase transition .",
    "this shows that the approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite is far from exact . in spite of this",
    ", we found that the discrepancy of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with the method described here is almost insignificant when the minimal degree @xmath119 is large ( say @xmath120 ) .",
    "the discrepancy between dorogovtsev et al.s approximation and numerical simulations also improves slowly when @xmath0 decreases , their result being exact for @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the approximation allows some analytic results , e.g. for @xmath101 , to be derived within it and it is numerically less demanding and thus significantly faster than ours .    , divided by @xmath117 for @xmath118 as a function of temperature .",
    "note the drops at the transition temperatures , from left to right , the transitions are for : powerlaw @xmath96 @xmath77 @xmath97 @xmath98 , bimodal @xmath77 @xmath122 , bimodal @xmath77 @xmath123 , and bimodal @xmath124 @xmath122 . the insets show the cumulative distribution of effective fields @xmath125 on a neighbouring node , @xmath126 for the bimodal random graph with @xmath124 and @xmath122 ( left inset ) and for the powerlaw @xmath96 @xmath77 @xmath97 @xmath98 case ( right inset ) .",
    "various temperatures are shown , @xmath12 increases from left to right .",
    "the plateau at @xmath114 for the bimodal cases is where the @xmath115 nodes are unmagnetised , @xmath127 .",
    "[ distributionsofhandx ] ]    in conclusion , we have presented a method for solving the potts model on a random graph of given degree distribution .",
    "the method does not make the approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite and thus is accurate in all cases when the local tree approximation is applicable , giving results in good agreement with our simulations .",
