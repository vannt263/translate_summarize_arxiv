    "over the past 25 years various lattice models of a single self - interacting polymer chain in ( dilute ) solution have been analysed in both two and three dimensions .",
    "the fundamental physical phase transition @xcite that these models attempt to mimic is that of the collapse of a single polymer in a poor solvent as the temperature is lowered . at high temperatures",
    "a polymer is swollen relative to a reference gaussian state , while at low temperatures the polymer forms a liquid - drop - like globule @xcite .",
    "there is a continuous phase transition expected between these two states , which is referred to as the @xmath0-point .",
    "one question that arises concerns the robustness of the universality class of the collapse transition .",
    "the standard theory @xcite of the collapse transition is based on the @xmath1 limit of the magnetic tri - critical @xmath2 o(@xmath3 ) field theory and related edwards model with two and three body forces @xcite , which predicts an upper critical dimension of three with subtle scaling behaviour in that dimension . on the other hand recent studies @xcite of semi - flexible polymers",
    "indicate that collapse transition can be first - order , and a polymer crystal can exist at low temperatures in the presence of stiffness .",
    "the canonical lattice model of the configurations of a polymer in solution has been the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) where a random walk on a lattice is not allowed to visit a lattice site more than once .",
    "self - avoiding walks display the so - called excluded volume effect where they are swollen in size relative to unrestricted random walks of the same length : their size scales with a different characteristic exponent to that of the unrestricted random walk . a common way @xcite to model intra - polymer interactions in such a walk is to assign an energy to each non - consecutive pair of monomers lying on neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "this is the interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model , which is the standard lattice model of polymer collapse using self - avoiding walks .",
    "on the other hand self - avoiding trails @xcite , which are lattice random walks that are not allowed to visit a lattice bond more than once also display the same excluded volume behaviour as saw and physical polymers , with the same scaling exponents .",
    "moreover , a self - interacting self - avoiding trail model ( isat ) , where multiply occupied sites are assigned an energy , has also displayed some of the characteristics of the polymer collapse described above @xcite .",
    "however , analyses of both two- and three - dimensional self - interacting trails @xcite indicate that the collapse transition of the isat model is in a different universality class to that of self - interacting self - avoiding walks ( isaw ) in those respective dimensions .",
    "there is no clear understanding of why this is the case if true .",
    "it is important to note that work in two dimensions has focused on the square lattice model only .",
    "some of the work @xcite on the isat model has been via a growth process known as `` kinetic growth trails '' or `` smart kinetic trails '' that maps to one particular temperature of the equilibrium isat model on the lattices studied ( it is important to note that these lattices are of coordination number four ) .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that the collapse transition associated with `` smart kinetic trails '' is first - order .",
    "clear evidence was produced in @xcite to demonstrate that there was a first - order transition in three dimensions on the diamond lattice .",
    "on the other hand no evidence of this could be found in two dimensions .",
    "in fact , on the square lattice recent work @xcite verified that the isat collapse transition on the square lattice is precisely that given by the growth process and is not first - order or like the @xmath0-point of isaw .",
    "another approach has been to analyse a generalised ensemble ( rather than the finite length ensemble ) of the model via transfer matrix @xcite : this has produced some intriguing results with different values of critical exponents being estimated .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that these results are not incompatible with those for the finite length ensemble .",
    "this may be an indication though that the point in question is multi - critical of some type .",
    "in this paper we study the isat model and kinetic growth trails on the _ triangular _ lattice , importantly a coordination number six lattice .",
    "we demonstrate that the kinetic growth model does not map to any temperature of the canonical isat model but rather to a point ( we shall call this the _ kinetic growth point _ ) in the parameter space of a generalised model we call the extended isat model ( eisat ) .",
    "as such we have studied this eisat model and identify this kinetic growth point as a multi - critical collapse point . by studying the eisat model we build a picture of the collapse transition in the trail model of polymers that includes both the first - order transition suggested in @xcite and the isaw @xmath0-point .",
    "it may also prove useful in explaining the transfer matrix results .",
    "the collapse transition can be characterised via a change in the scaling of the size of the polymer with temperature .",
    "it is expected that some measure of the size , such as the radius of gyration or the mean squared distance of a monomer from the end points , @xmath4 , scales at fixed temperature as @xmath5 with some exponent @xmath6 . at high temperatures",
    "the polymer is swollen and in two dimensions it is accepted that @xmath7 @xcite . at low temperatures",
    "the polymer becomes dense in space , though not space filling , and the exponent is @xmath8 .",
    "the collapse phase transition is expected to take place at some temperature @xmath9 .",
    "if the transition is second - order , the scaling at @xmath9 of the size is intermediate between the high and low temperature forms . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "there is expected to be a singularity in the free energy , which can be seen in its second derivative ( the specific heat ) . denoting the ( intensive ) finite length specific heat _ per monomer _ by @xmath10 , the thermodynamic limit is given by the long length limit as @xmath11 one expects that the singular part of the specific heat behaves as @xmath12 where @xmath13 for a second - order phase transition . the singular part of the thermodynamic limit internal energy behaves as @xmath14 if the transition is second - order , and there is a jump in the internal energy if the transition is first - order ( an effective value of @xmath15 ) .",
    "moreover one expects crossover scaling forms @xcite to apply around this temperature , so that @xmath16 with @xmath17 if the transition is second - order and @xmath18 if the transition is first - order . from @xcite",

    "consider a stochastic process defined on the triangular lattice as follows : starting at an origin site , a lattice path is built up step - by - step by choosing between available continuing steps from unoccupied lattice bonds with equal probability .",

    "if we do not consider the original occupation of the origin as a visit , then each site may be visited up to three times on the triangular lattice .",
    "note that when the process revisits the origin , the growth rule is slightly altered : the process may choose the direction of the first step as one of its options equally with the unoccupied lattice bonds .",

    "there , the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath20 defined in the introduction can be related to the behaviour of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . assuming a similar form of critical behaviour is found in the triangular lattice model we would expect that @xmath48 and @xmath49 also @xmath50 and @xmath51 where either the @xmath52 or the constant term dominates dependent on whether @xmath19 is positive or negative .",

    "intriguingly this plot show evidence for transitions at large @xmath191 and @xmath192 .     of the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath191 and @xmath192 at length @xmath193 ( the lighter the shade , the larger the value ) . ]    this would seem to indicate a collapse - collapse phase transition with two different collapsed states .",
    "such a transition has been seen to occur in the low temperature behaviour of the isaw when a stiffness energy is added to model semi - flexible polymers .",
    "one of the two low temperature phases in that model is an ordered crystalline - like phase .",
    "relatedly this occurs when the collapse is a first - order transition .    to test the possibility that the low temperature collapsed phase when @xmath189 is frozen we have plotted in figure  [ plot_density_k_6 ] the proportion of steps of the trail _ not _ involved with a triply - visited site",
    "given the collapsed nature of the phase it is appropriate to assume that the polymer has a surface @xcite and so we plot our estimate against @xmath194 .    , which measures the proportion of steps that are not involved with triply - visited sites per unit length , against @xmath195 at a point @xmath196 in the hypothesised frozen ( crystal - like ) phase .",
    "as the length increases this quantity vanishes . ]",
    "we have chosen a point in the @xmath186 model .",
    "the quantity @xmath197 $ ] is tending to zero as @xmath3 is increased , suggesting that , proportionally , all sites of the trail will be triply - visited : we can deduce that configurations produced are maximally dense and solid - like . in figure  [ densetriplevisits ]",
    "we display a typical configuration produced by our simulations when @xmath198 : it is space - filling , forming a crystal - like structure , being almost totally made up of triply - visited sites .",
    "produced at @xmath198 which looks like an ordered crystal . ]",
    "we find the same behaviour for the @xmath157 model at low temperatures .    for the sake of comparison we have considered the same quantity @xmath199 in the low temperature region of the @xmath138 model . in figure  [ density_vs_n ]",
    "we plot the proportion of steps that are not involved with triply - visited sites per unit length against @xmath194 at the point @xmath200 : this quantity clearly converges to a non - zero value .    , which measures the proportion of steps that are not involved with triply - visited sites per unit length , against @xmath195 at a point @xmath200 in the collapsed liquid - drop - like globule phase .",
    "as the length increases this reaches a non - zero value . ]    in figure  [ densedoublevisits ] we display a typical configuration produced by our simulations when @xmath201 : while dense , the configuration still has internal holes and seems disordered .",
    "produced at @xmath201 , which is in the globule phase : it looks disordered and rather more like a liquid - like globule than a crystal . ]    from the above considerations it seems that the phases that exist in our eisat model on the triangular lattice are of a similar type to those in the semi - flexible isaw phase diagram @xcite : namely a high temperature swollen phase and two low temperatures phases : one a disordered liquid drop - like globular phase and a second crystalline - like phase .",
    "we can now build a complete picture of the phase diagram of the extended isat model on the triangular lattice .",
    "a schematic of the conjectured phase diagram is shown in figure  [ phasediagram ] .      for small @xmath191 and @xmath192 we see the usual swollen polymer phase where @xmath7 . for large enough @xmath191",
    "regardless of @xmath192 we find a collapse phase as occurs in the isaw model and a transition between the swollen and collapsed globule phases which seems to be @xmath0-like . on the other hand for large enough @xmath192 we find crystal - like configurations that are space filling and",
    "internally contain only triply - visited sites . between the swollen phase and the crystal - like phase",
    "the collapse transition is first - order .",
    "separating this line of first - order transitions from the line of @xmath0-like transitions is a multi - critical point .",
    "this point is precisely the point to which the kinetic growth process of trails maps .",
    "it would seem that this larger parameter space has exposed a way of understanding the apparent differences and similarities of the isat and isaw models .",
    "when isaw is generalised with the addition of stiffness , and isat on a large enough coordination number lattice is generalised with different weightings for different numbers of visits , both display three polymer phases : swollen coil , globule and polymer crystal .",
    "note that for the eisat model considered here , the crystal - like phase has non - zero entropy and as such is strictly speaking not a proper crystalline phase , but rather a maximally dense phase .",
    "this is in contrast to the polymer crystal phase found in the semi - flexible isaw model @xcite , where one finds zero - entropy @xmath99-sheet like structures .    in two dimensions both semi - flexible isaw and eisat",
    "have a first - order collapse transition between swollen coil and crystal - like phases , and a @xmath0-point like transition between swollen coil and globule phases .",
    "it is also apparent that the square lattice isat model is unusual in that it only displays the multi - critical point , which is found in these generalised models as part of a larger phase diagram .",
