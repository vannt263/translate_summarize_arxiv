    "cold atoms in optical lattices represent a remarkably clean and controllable systems to simulate and study many - body physics @xcite .",
    "a crucial ingredient for realizing various phases of matter is availability of interactions with different strength and range .",
    "the interaction between the ground - state atoms in a lattice is typically short range ( on - site ) and can be tuned relative to the ( inter - site ) tunneling energy to realize the hubbard s model transition from the superfluid to the mott insulator phase with precisely one atom per lattice site @xcite .",
    "second order tunneling @xcite can translate into an effective nearest - neighbor interaction which allows the realization of the heisenberg spin or extended hubbard models @xcite .",
    "dipolar interactions @xcite between atoms with large magnetic moment or between polar molecules have still longer range .",
    "but atoms excited to the rydberg states exhibit unprecedented magnitude and range of dipole - dipole or van der waals interactions @xcite . dressing ground state atoms by the rydberg state with an off - resonant laser field can thus lead to an effective long - range interaction @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to explore resonant coupling of the ground state atoms to the highly excited rydberg states @xcite .",
    "the interaction between the atoms in rydberg states translates into the level shifts of multiple rydberg excitations which are therefore suppressed in dense atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "thus , within a small volume , where the interatomic interaction energies exceed the excitation linewidth of the rydberg state , a single rydberg atom blocks the excitation of all the other atoms @xcite .",
    "larger atomic ensembles can accommodate more rydberg excitations which effectively repel each other so that no two rydberg atoms can appear closer than the blockade distance @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the total number of excitations within the ensemble exhibits reduced fluctuations @xcite .",
    "spatial correlations and crystallization of rydberg excitations have recently invigorated many theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "a salient experiment of schau  _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated spatial ordering of rydberg excitations of resonantly driven atoms in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattice . in an atomic cloud with the diameter of about two blockade distances , up to five rydberg excitations",
    "were observed . in that experiment ,",
    "the lifetime of the rydberg state and the coherence time of the atomic polarization were much longer than the duration ( @xmath1s ) of the optical excitation pulses .",
    "hence , neglecting the relaxations , numerical simulations of the coherent excitation dynamics of many - body system well reproduced the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to obtain and characterize the many - body stationary state of a strongly interacting dissipative system subject to continuous ( long - time ) excitation . to that end , we employ an iterative monte carlo sampling algorithm @xcite to simulate the steady - state distribution of rydberg excitations of the van der waals interacting atoms in a 2d lattice of variable size .",
    "as shown in @xcite , however , the state of the system resulting after only a few @xmath2s driving is already close to the steady state . similarly to @xcite , we obtain spatially ordered patterns formed by definite numbers of rydberg excitations , while the probability distribution of the excitation numbers is very narrow ( highly sub - poissonian ) characterized by a large negative value of the mandel @xmath0 parameter @xcite . in a moderately sized atomic cloud , a few mutually repelling rydberg excitations dwell near the circular boundary of the system , as was also observed in @xcite .",
    "with increasing the size ( diameter @xmath3 ) of the cloud , while keeping the atomic density fixed , the mean number of rydberg excitations grows ( @xmath4 ) , but its distribution remains sub - poissonian with nearly constant @xmath5 .",
    "concurrently , the rydberg excitations tend to arrange in regular spatial shell structures , which are , however , progressively smeared for larger number of excitations . the corresponding density - density correlations decay on the length scale of the blockade distance .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after describing the monte carlo procedure in sec .  [",
    "sec : mc ] , we present the results of numerical simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , followed by the discussion and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "strongly interacting many - body systems are rarely amenable to exact numerical treatment due to the exponential scaling of the corresponding hilbert space with the system size . for an ensemble of @xmath6 two - level atoms interacting via a long - range potential , truncating the hilbert space by limiting the number of rydberg excitations can greatly reduce the dimension of the problem and allow approximate solutions for tens or hundreds of atoms sharing several excitations @xcite . as an alternative technique , semiclassical monte carlo simulations @xcite can efficiently deal with many more atoms and excitations .",
    "the essence of the semiclassical methods is to treat each atom separately in a potential generated by all the other atoms excited to the rydberg state , while neglecting the inter - atomic coherences ( entanglement ) .",
    "this approximation is valid when the dephasing rate of the atomic polarization is larger than the rabi frequency of the driving field @xcite .",
    "let us recall the properties of a single two - level atom driven by a laser field with rabi frequency @xmath7 and detuning @xmath8 on the transition from the ground state @xmath9 to the excited ( rydberg ) state @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the decay rate of the excited state population @xmath12 , and by @xmath13 the relaxation rate of atomic polarization @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the projection ( @xmath16 ) or transition ( @xmath17 ) operator of the atom .",
    "the steady - state population of the rydberg state is then a lorentzian function of detuning @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath18 with the width @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and we assume strong driving @xmath21 ( or weak decay @xmath22 ) . on resonance , @xmath23 ,",
    "the population saturates to @xmath24 .",
    "atoms in the rydberg state @xmath10 interact pairwise via the van der waals ( vdw ) potential , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the vdw coefficient and @xmath27 is the interatomic distance @xcite .",
    "hence , given an atom @xmath28 in state @xmath10 , it will induce a level shift @xmath29 of another atom @xmath30 , which effectively translates into the detuning @xmath8 .",
    "when @xmath31 , the transition @xmath32 of atom @xmath30 is non - resonant and its rydberg excitation is blocked by atom @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "we can therefore define the blockade distance @xmath33 via @xmath34 which yields @xmath35{c_6/w}$ ] .",
    "our aim is to obtain the stationary distribution of rydberg excitations of @xmath36 atoms in a 2d lattice .",
    "we make a semiclassical approximation which discards quantum correlations between the atoms but preserves classical @xmath6-body correlations .",
    "its validity hinges on the assumption of strong dephasing @xmath37 which suppresses intra- and interatomic coherences and disentangles the atoms @xcite .",
    "each atom @xmath30 then behaves as a driven two - level system of eq .",
    "( [ sigrr ] ) but with the detuning @xmath8 determined by operator @xmath38 which describes the total interaction - induced shift of its level @xmath10 involving the contributions of all the other rydberg atoms @xmath39 .",
    "we employ the procedure described in @xcite to generate the stationary distribution of rydberg excitations in an ensemble of @xmath40 atoms .",
    "the algorithm performs an iterative monte carlo sampling of @xmath41 for @xmath6 atoms , in the spirit of the hartree - fock method .",

    ". then , at every step , for each atom @xmath30 , we set @xmath43 or @xmath44 with the probability determined by its current rydberg state population @xmath45 . in turn",
    ", the thus constructed binary configuration of rydberg excitations @xmath46 determines the level shift @xmath47 ( equivalent to detuning @xmath8 ) of atom @xmath30 when evaluating @xmath45 .",
    "we continuously iterate this procedure , sifting repeatedly through every atom in the potential generated by all the other atoms .",
    "we thus generate a large number ( @xmath48 ) of configurations @xmath41 from which we obtain the averaged probability distribution @xmath49 of rydberg excitations and their correlations @xmath50 , as well as the probabilities @xmath51 of @xmath52 rydberg excitations and their spatial patterns .",
    "note that in the experiment , after preparing the atoms in the ground state @xmath9 and exciting them with a laser , one performs projective measurements @xmath41 of rydberg excitations @xcite .",
    "every experimental sequence then results in a particular configuration @xmath53 , and averaging over many such experimental sequences yields the rydberg excitation probabilities for individual atoms or the whole ensemble .",
    "hence , the monte carlo sampling of the excitation configurations closely imitates the experiment .",
    "in our simulations , we use the parameters similar to those in the experiment @xcite , with the exception of a larger relaxation rate @xmath13 compatible with the semiclassical approximation .",
    "we thus assume a 2d lattice of cold @xmath54rb atoms whose ground state @xmath55 is coupled to the rydberg state @xmath56 by a two - photon transition with the rabi frequency @xmath57khz .",
    "the decay rate of @xmath10 is @xmath58khz and we take large enough coherence relaxation rate @xmath59khz ( in the experiment @xmath60khz , stemming from the two - photon laser linewidth @xmath61khz and residual decay @xmath62khz of the atomic intermediate state to the ground state @xcite ) .",

    "a poissonian distribution @xmath84 would lead to @xmath85 , while @xmath86 corresponds to sub - poissonian distribution , with @xmath87 attained for a definite number @xmath52 of excitations .",

    "we then determine the mean angle of the position vectors of all the excited atoms with respect to a reference ( @xmath92 ) axis and rotate the configuration about the origin by that angle .",

    "the @xmath52 excitations are pushed to the boundary , and their angular separation is @xmath97 .",
    "but already for @xmath98 we encounter a significant probability of rydberg excitation at the cloud center , while for @xmath99 we clearly observe a double peak structure of @xmath94 , with the largest peak close to the boundary of the cloud and the smaller peak corresponding to the inside ring of the corresponding 2d density plot .",
    "the distance between the two peaks of @xmath94 is somewhat larger than the blockade distance @xmath33 ( see below ) .",
    "simultaneously , we observe reduced contrast of the angular distribution @xmath95 .",
    "vs distance @xmath27 ; the maximum is at @xmath100.,width=226 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] we plot the normalized spatial correlations @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the kronecker delta which selects the pairs of atoms @xmath103 at distance @xmath104 . clearly , at short distances @xmath105",
    "the rydberg excitations avoid each other @xcite , while at @xmath106 slightly larger than @xmath33 there is a pronounced maximum of @xmath107 , which implies higher probability of finding pairs of rydberg excitations separated by distance @xmath106 .",
    "precisely this suppression , or blockade , of rydberg excitations at shorter distances , and the elevated probability of excitations at distance @xmath106 , are responsible for the observed quasi - crystallization and inner shell structure of the spatial distribution of @xmath49 . at longer distances @xmath108 , the correlation function @xmath107 exhibits strongly damped spatial oscillations , signifying the absence of long - range order .",
    "similar results were obtained for a 1d system in @xcite , where it was found that the correlation length @xmath109 exceeding the oscillation period @xmath110 can only be attained at very high atomic densities ( thirty or more atoms per blockade distance @xmath33 ) .",
    "above we have analyzed the steady - state distribution of rydberg excitations in a 2d cloud of atoms subject to continuous resonant driving .",
    "we have observed very narrow ( sub - poissonian ) distribution of the number of excitations and the formation of regular spatial structures of definite numbers of rydberg excitations .",
    "these quasi - crystals are effected by the boundary of the system and the effective repulsion between the rydberg excitations which avoid each other at distances smaller than the blockade distance @xmath33 .",
    "a cloud of diameter @xmath96 can then accommodate only a few rydberg excitations which dwell near the boundary . with increasing the cloud size @xmath3 , the rydberg quasi - crystals grow , forming spatial shell structures , but their contrast decreases and beyond @xmath111 they are hardly discernible .",
    "the absence of the long - range order in rydberg quasi - crystals , also attested by the rapid decay of the density - density correlation function @xmath107 , is due to the `` softness '' of the van der waals potential and the finite excitation linewidth @xmath112 of the rydberg state . yet ,",
    "the mandel @xmath0 parameter , which quantifies the counting statistics of the rydberg excitations , remains negative and nearly independent of the system size .",
    "sub - poissonian statistics of the number of rydberg excitations and the corresponding negative values of the mandel @xmath0 parameter were observed in several experiment @xcite which dealt with the transient unitary dynamics of the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that for a coherently driven system @xmath113 @xcite while incoherent excitation studied here results in @xmath114 and the rydberg quasi - crystal exhibits sharper contrast than in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "dephasing leads to stronger classical ( density - density ) correlations of rydberg excitation .",
    "this effect is inherited @xcite from a single superatom ",
    "collection of atoms within the blockade distance : without dephasing , the rydberg population of a superatom saturates to @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) ; with strong dephasing and many atoms , @xmath71 approaches 1 ( @xmath87 ) , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrq ] for @xmath117 .    in our simulations",
    ", we assumed an experimental setup similar to that in @xcite , i.e. , square lattice with circular boundary , obtaining , for a moderately sized atomic cloud , qualitatively similar results .",
    "taking , instead , a different lattice geometry would lead to different spatial ordering of rydberg excitations , but the more fundamental quantities , @xmath0 and @xmath118 , would behave invariantly for a large cloud of the same atom density .",
    "let us finally discuss the limitations of our approach and the obtained results .",
    "the two key questions are whether the steady state can be attained in a real cold - atom experiment , especially for a large ensemble of @xmath119 atoms , and to what extend the employed semiclassical treatment is adequate to describe the true steady state of the system .",
    "these questions were addressed in @xcite , at least for a moderate number of atoms @xmath120 , and here we briefly summarize the conclusions . in an experiment with typical relaxation rates of the atoms @xcite ,",
    "the time scale for attaining the true many - body steady state is tens of @xmath2s  or more for larger @xmath6which can be prohibitively long due to the loss of atoms and the need of continuous laser irradiation .",
    "however , already after several @xmath2s of laser driving , the spatial probability distribution of rydberg excitations ceases to change appreciably @xcite being close to the steady - state distribution @xcite . moreover , stronger coherence relaxation @xmath37 will quickly dephase the atoms rendering the system essentially classical but still strongly correlated @xcite",
