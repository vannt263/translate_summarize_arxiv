    "the concept of nanometer - scale regions of polarization , randomly embedded within a non - polar cubic matrix , has become central to attempts to explain the remarkable physical properties of relaxors such as pbmg@xmath2nb@xmath3o@xmath4 ( pmn ) and pbzn@xmath2nb@xmath3o@xmath4 ( pzn ) .",
    "@xcite the existence of these so - called `` polar nanoregions '' ( pnr ) was first inferred from the optic index of refraction studies of burns and dacol on pmn , pzn , and other related systems ,  @xcite and later confirmed using many different experimental techniques including x - ray and neutron diffraction ,  @xcite @xmath16pb nmr ,  @xcite and piezoresponse force microscopy .",
    "@xcite early small - angle x - ray scattering and neutron pair distribution function ( pdf ) measurements on pmn by egami _",
    "et al_.  cast doubt on the nano - domain model of relaxors .",
    "@xcite however , the recent pdf analysis of jeong _ et al_. , which shows the formation of polar ionic shifts in pmn below @xmath17k , and which occupy only one third of the total sample volume at low temperatures , provides convincing support for the existence of pnr .",
    "@xcite neutron inelastic scattering data published by naberezhnov _ et al_.  on pmn offered the first dynamical evidence of pnr in the form of a prominent broadening of the transverse acoustic ( ta ) mode that coincides with the onset of strong diffuse scattering at 650k ,  @xcite roughly the same temperature ( @xmath18k ) as that reported by burns and dacol in their optical study of pmn .",
    "this temperature , commonly known as the burns temperature , and denoted by @xmath9 in the original paper , is widely viewed as that at which static pnr first appear .",
    "likely condensing from a soft to mode , distinctive butterfly - shaped and ellipsoidal diffuse scattering intensity contours centered on @xmath7 and @xmath19 bragg peaks , respectively , are seen below @xmath9 in both pmn  @xcite and pzn .",
    "@xcite similar diffuse scattering patterns were subsequently observed in solid solutions of pmn and pzn with pbtio@xmath4 ( pmn-@xmath20pt and pzn-@xmath20pt ) ; however these patterns appear only on the ti - poor ( relaxor ) side of the well - known morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) .",
    "@xcite the polar nature of the strong diffuse scattering , and thus its association with the formation of pnr , was unambiguously established by several electric field studies of pmn  @xcite and pzn-8%pt ,  @xcite all of which showed dramatic changes in the shape and intensity of the diffuse scattering as a function of field strength and field orientation .",
    "the burns temperature @xmath9 thus represents what is arguably the most important temperature scale in relaxors and is several hundred degrees kelvin higher than the critical temperature @xmath21 ( which for pmn is @xmath22k , but defined only in non - zero electric field ) .",

    "@xcite have proven to be extremely important because they demonstrated the utility of cold neutron spectroscopy to the study of relaxors .",
    "generally speaking cold neutrons are ill - suited to lattice dynamical studies because the longer wavelengths necessarily limit their use to the study of comparatively fewer ( lower-@xmath24 ) brillouin zones . on the other hand cold neutron spectrometers provide significantly better energy ( @xmath25 ) and wave vector ( @xmath14 ) resolution than do their thermal neutron counterparts .",
    "in addition , both the ( 110 ) and the ( 100 ) brillouin zones of pmn are accessible using cold neutrons with wavelengths @xmath26 . the combined cold and thermal neutron study of pmn by hiraka _",
    "et al_.  exploited this fact and uncovered several major new findings , two of which are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "@xcite the first finding is that the temperature at which the strong diffuse scattering vanishes depends on whether the measurement is made with cold or thermal neutrons , i.  e.  the value of @xmath9 depends on the energy resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "this fact , which is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , indicates that the diffuse scattering in pmn , and most likely other relaxors , contains a substantial quasielastic component .",
    "however , a consensus on this issue is lacking ; while the finding of hiraka _ et al_.  is consistent with the study of gvasaliya _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite it contradicts that of hlinka _",
    "et al_.  @xcite a second major finding is displayed in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] where intensity contours of the diffuse scattering measured with cold neutrons around ( 110 ) are shown to exhibit markedly different reciprocal space geometries at 300k and 650k .",
    "these data unambiguously demonstrate the presence of two distinct types of diffuse scattering in pmn . as the pnr",
    "are absent at 650k @xmath27 , the physical origin of the bow - tie - shaped diffuse scattering cross section is believed to come primarily from the underlying chemical short - range order .",
    "we shall refer to this as csro , although another commonly - used term for this is compositionally / chemically ordered regions ( cor ) .",
    "@xcite    an intriguing perspective on the burns temperature in pmn is provided in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] where the ta phonon energy width @xmath23 , which is inversely proportional to the phonon lifetime , is plotted as a function of temperature for pmn at the scattering vector @xmath28 .",
    "these data were measured with thermal neutrons by wakimoto _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and are consistent with those of naberezhnov _",
    "et al_.  in that the ta mode begins to broaden at @xmath29k , the same temperature where the strong diffuse scattering first appears .",
    "these data also show that the ta broadening achieves a maximum value ( minimum lifetime ) near 420k , which coincides with the value of @xmath9 measured with cold neutrons .",
    "these data raise the question of how to interpret the burns temperature @xmath9 properly in that they paint a picture , markedly different from that currently held , in which the pnr are dynamic below @xmath30k and condense into static entities only at a much lower temperature of 420k .",
    "the goal of our study then is to determine the intrinsic value of the burns temperature @xmath9 and to clarify its relationship to the diffuse scattering , lattice dynamics , and structure in pmn . to this end",
    "we have carried out extensive measurements of the neutron diffuse scattering cross section from 10k to 900k , far below @xmath21 and well above the nominal value of @xmath9 , that probe timescales from @xmath0s to @xmath1s .",
    "we find that a 300-fold improvement in energy resolution over that used by hiraka _",
    "et al_. ,  @xcite obtained using neutron backscattering techniques reproduces the same onset temperature for the diffuse scattering ; hence the intrinsic burns temperature @xmath9 for pmn is 420k .",
    "at the same time an enormous change in the thermal expansion is observed near 420k , which is indistinguishable from zero at low temperature .",
    "given the revised value of @xmath9 , this result implies the existence of a direct influence of the pnr on the intrinsic structural properties of pmn .",
    "we also present new data on the effects of the pnr on the lattice dynamics through measurements of the temperature and wave vector dependence of the long - wavelength ta phonon energy width @xmath23 measured near ( 110 ) from 25k to 900k .",
    "we find that ta modes with reduced wave vectors @xmath31@xmath12 exhibit the same energy width at all temperature whereas those with @xmath32@xmath12 exhibit a strongly temperature - dependent broadening similar to that shown in the top panel of fig.[figure1 ] .",
    "this behavior contrasts with that observed in thermal neutron studies of the to mode , which exhibits a broadening for all @xmath33@xmath12 .",
    "previous neutron scattering work on pmn-60%pt by stock _",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite a material in which there is no strong , temperature dependent diffuse scattering , and thus no polar nanoregions , found no evidence of any ta phonon broadening . in this context ,",
    "our data lend extremely strong support to the pnr model : the lifetimes of ta modes with wavelengths comparable in size to the pnr are strongly diminished by the pnr , whereas long - wavelength ( low @xmath14 ) ta phonons simply average over the pnr and are unaffected .",
    "the neutron scattering data presented here were obtained using the bt9 thermal neutron triple - axis spectrometer , the spins cold neutron triple - axis spectrometer , and the cold neutron high flux backscattering spectrometer ( hfbs ) , all of which are located at the nist center for neutron research ( ncnr ) . on bt9 , measurements of the phonons and diffuse scattering were made at a fixed final ( thermal ) neutron energy @xmath3414.7mev ( @xmath35 ) using the ( 002 ) bragg reflection of highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) crystals to monochromate and analyze the incident and scattered neutron beams , respectively .",

    "the choice of ge was motivated by the close matching between the pmn ( 022 ) ( 1.431 ) and ge ( 004 ) ( 1.414 ) @xmath37-spacings , which provides a significant improvement in the instrumental @xmath14-resolution .",

    "a liquid - nitrogen cooled be filter was located after the sample to remove higher order neutron wavelengths from the scattered beam , and horizontal beam collimations were set to guide-80@xmath36-s-80@xmath36 - 80@xmath36 .",

    "this instrument uses a mechanically - driven si(111 ) monochromator to doppler shift the energies of incident neutrons over a narrow range centered about 2.08mev .",
    "neutrons are backscattered from the monochromator and proceed towards the sample where they are scattered into a 12m@xmath42 array of si ( 111 ) crystals that serve as analyzer .",
    "these neutrons are then backscattered a second time by the analyzer , which selects the final neutron energy @xmath43mev , into a series of detectors positioned about the sample .",

    "@xcite the crystal growth conditions were determined from the pseudo - binary phase diagram established for pmn and pbo .",
    "the pmn#4 and # 5 crystals weigh 2.7 g ( 0.33@xmath47 ) and 4.8 g ( 0.59@xmath47 ) , respectively . at 300k the mosaic of each crystal measured at ( 220 ) is less than 0.04@xmath48 full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",

    "@xcite the idea that the pnr are uniformly displaced with respect to the underlying cubic lattice in a direction parallel to the pnr polarization has already been used by gehring _ et al_.  to explain the persistence of the strong diffuse scattering in a single crystal of pzn-8%pt against large electric fields applied along [ 001 ] .",
    "@xcite in that study it was shown that the diffuse scattering near ( 003 ) , which measures the projections of the ionic displacements along [ 001 ] , decreases under an external [ 001 ] field as expected .",

    "we associate the weak , temperature - independent , diffuse scattering , which shows no obvious change across either @xmath21 or @xmath9 , with chemical short - range order because it persists to extremely high temperature .",

    "the neutron inelastic measurements on pmn-60%pt by stock _",
    "et al_.  prove conclusively that pnr can not be the origin of the anomalous broadening of long - wavelength to modes observed in pmn , pzn , and other compounds , also known as the waterfall effect , because pmn-60%pt exhibits the same effect but no strong diffuse scattering ( no pnr ) .",
    "@xcite by contrast , many studies have shown that pnr do broaden the ta modes in pmn  @xcite and in pzn-@xmath20pt ,  @xcite but that such effects are absent in compositions with no pnr such as pmn-60%pt .",

    "the crossover between null and large coefficients of thermal expansion coincides closely with @xmath9 , which suggests that the appearance of static pnr strongly affects the thermal expansion in pmn and thus provides a structural signature of the formation of short - range , polar correlations in zero field .",

    "@xcite arguing by analogy with magnetic systems , stock _",
    "et al_.  considered a three - dimensional heisenberg model with cubic anisotropy in the presence of random fields in which the heisenberg spin corresponds to the local ferroelectric polarization , the cubic anisotropy represents the preferential orientation of the polarization along the < 111 > axes , and the isotropic random magnetic field corresponds to the randomly - oriented local electric fields that originate from the varying charge of the @xmath64-site cation . following a suggestion by aharony , stock _",
    "et al_.  considered the case where the heisenberg term dominates over the random field term , and the cubic anisotropy term is the weakest of the three . in this picture there would be just two distinct , static , temperature scales . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the cubic anisotropy is irrelevant and therefore the system should behave like a heisenberg system in a random field . in this case",
    "the excitation spectrum is characterized by goldstone modes and therefore no long - range order is expected in the presence of random fields .",
    "@xcite instead the system forms polar nanoregions in a paraelectric background .",
    "the second temperature scale @xmath21 appears at low temperatures where the cubic anisotropy term becomes important , and in this limit the system should resemble an ising system in the presence of a random field .",
    "this model thus explains the local ferroelectric distortion characterized by the recovery of the soft - optic mode and , although a 3d ising system in equilibrium should display long - range order in the presence of small random fields , as is observed in magnetic systems , nonequilibrium effects with long time scales become dominant .",
    "the presence of such nonequilibrium effects may explain the lack of long - range ferroelectric order in pmn and pzn as well as the history dependence of physical properties such as the linear birefringence .",
    "the phase - shifted nature of the polar nanoregions may also create another energy barrier against the ordered phase at @xmath21 .",
    "et al_.  are also able to explain the physics of compounds beyond the mpb , such as pmn-60%pt , within this model , for which only one temperature scale ( @xmath21 ) exists .",
    "as the ti concentration ti increases , the relaxor phase diagram crosses over to a ferroelectric regime , and this can be understood as an increase in the strength of the cubic anisotropy term that is simultaneously accompanied by a reduction of the random fields as must occur in the limit of pure pbtio@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite it should be mentioned that other studies have invoked random fields to explain the static and dynamic properties of relaxors .",
    "@xcite    independent of the validity of either of the two pictures summarized above , the seminal finding of our study of remains that the strong diffuse scattering in pmn first appears at a temperature that depends sensitively on the energy resolution of the measurement .",
    "this fact inevitably raises interesting questions about the significance of the previous value of the burns temperature ( @xmath122k ) . if the strong diffuse scattering in pmn results from the soft to mode , then other techniques based on x - ray diffraction , thermal neutron scattering , or neutron pdf , which provide comparatively much coarser energy resolution , will be unable to discriminate between low - energy , dynamic , short - range polar correlations and truly static ( @xmath40 ) pnr because any low - energy , polar correlations will be integrated into the elastic channel by the broad energy resolution .",
    "thus as the to mode softens , the associated low - energy , polar , spectral weight will fall within the energy resolution at temperatures above @xmath118k , and the net result will be an artificially higher value of @xmath9 that increases with the size of the energy resolution .",
    "this effect should be especially pronounced for phonon modes that are broad in energy ( i.  e.  that have short lifetimes ) , and this is clearly the case for the soft to mode in pmn , which exhibits a nearly overdamped lineshape and a minimum frequency precisely at @xmath118k . while it is true that the structure factor of the strong diffuse scattering is inconsistent with that of the soft to mode , the phase - shifted model of hirota _",
    "et al_.  provides a way to reconcile this discrepancy . in this respect , we simply suggest that the previous value of @xmath131k might not represent a physically meaningful temperature scale in pmn .",
    "future studies examining the values of @xmath9 in other relaxor compounds with improved energy resolution are thus of interest .    our reassessment of the burns temperature @xmath9 immediately clarifies an intimate relationship between the formation of static , short - range polar correlations and the consequent effects on both the low - energy lattice dynamics and structure of pmn .",
    "cold neutron triple - axis and backscattering spectroscopic methods conclusively show the existence of static , short - range polar correlations , only below @xmath89,k on timescales of at least 2ns .",
    "thermal neutron measurements of the lattice dynamics reflect the presence of these static pnr through the presence of a distinct minimum in both the soft to and ta mode energies , both of which occur at 420k .",
    "the effect of pnr on the lattice dynamics is evident only for ta modes having wave vectors of order 0.2@xmath12 , a fact that could be exploited to determine the size of the pnr . at the same time",
    "an enormous change in the coefficient of thermal expansion is seen near @xmath9 , below which the crystal lattice exhibits invar - like behavior .",

    "<S> we observed two distinct types of diffuse scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the first is weak , relatively temperature independent , persists to at least 900k , and forms bow - tie - shaped patterns in reciprocal space centered on @xmath7 bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we associate this primarily with chemical short - range order . </S>",
    "<S> the second is strong , temperature dependent , and forms butterfly - shaped patterns centered on @xmath7 bragg peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this diffuse scattering has been attributed to the pnr because it responds to an electric field and vanishes near @xmath6k when measured with thermal neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it vanishes at 420k when measured with cold neutrons , which provide @xmath8 times superior energy resolution . </S>",
    "<S> that this onset temperature depends so strongly on the instrumental energy resolution indicates that the diffuse scattering has a quasielastic character and demands a reassessment of the burns temperature @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> neutron backscattering measurements made with 300 times better energy resolution confirm the onset temperature of @xmath10k . </S>",
    "<S> the energy width of the diffuse scattering is resolution limited , indicating that the pnr are static on timescales of at least 2ns between 420k and 10k . </S>",
    "<S> transverse acoustic ( ta ) phonon lifetimes , which are known to decrease dramatically for wave vectors @xmath11  @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are temperature independent up to 900k for @xmath14 close to the zone center . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates a physical picture in which sufficiently long - wavelength ta phonons average over the pnr ; only those ta phonons having wavelengths comparable to the size of the pnr are affected . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the pmn lattice constant changes by less than 0.001  below 300k , but expands rapidly at a rate of @xmath151/k at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these disparate regimes of low and high thermal expansion bracket the revised value of @xmath9 , which suggests the anomalous thermal expansion results from the condensation of static pnr . </S>"
