    "the temporal properties of the radio wavelength sky are poorly understood .",
    "much of what is known results from follow - up of events discovered at optical , x - ray , or @xmath3-ray wavelengths such as supernovae , gamma - ray burst , and x - ray binaries . an important exception is the sub - second domain , which has been systematically , if incompletely , explored , leading to the discovery of pulsars @xcite , rotating radio transients @xcite , and other unexplained phenomena @xcite .",
    "longer - time scale searches , which tend to be sensitive to synchrotron sources , are rarer and the sky coverage is less complete .    systematic searches on long timescales for radio transients ( rts ) are undergoing a renaissance that is defining the available parameter space .",
    "these searches are motivated by the specific promise of orphan gamma - ray burst afterglows @xcite , radio supernovae , tidally - disrupted stars around massive black holes @xcite , intrinsic agn activity such as found in iii zw 2 @xcite , extreme scattering events @xcite , stellar events @xcite , and counterparts to gravity - wave events @xcite . additionally , these searches are motivated by the desire to fully characterize the radio sky and discover the unexpected and unpredicted .",
    "archival searches have proven fruitful in this search , uncovering a number of transients that are not easily explained with known source classes @xcite .",
    "these archival surveys have been powerful for the volume probed but the absence of the opportunity for real - time follow - up has significantly limited their value in characterizing the source population .",
    "synoptic transit surveys have also been carried out @xcite . in particular , a number of new variable and transient sources without deep radio or optical counterparts have been found .",
    "@xcite argue that these may be bursts from galactic neutron stars ; other evidence suggests that they could be strong bursts from low - mass flare stars .",
    "the success of archival surveys has lead to a growing number of unbiased surveys including those carried out by the allen telescope array ( ata ; * ? ? ?",
    "the atats survey places limits on rare , high flux density transients and variables @xcite .",
    "a recent vla / evla survey @xcite has now provided strong limits on the radio transient and variable population at 5 ghz .",
    "these authors also summarize existing rt surveys at frequencies @xmath4 ghz .",
    "long wavelength transients were searched for with the long wavelength array @xcite .",
    "these archival and unbiased surveys join targeted surveys of specific source classes in characterizing the radio transient sky .",
    "for example , the masiv survey @xcite and the university of michigan monitoring program @xcite provide characterization of bright , flat - spectrum radio sources , which are known to have the strongest variability amplitudes .",
    "the pi ghz sky survey ( pigss ) is a key project of the ata . in @xcite , hereafter paper i",
    ", we presented the survey description , methods in observation , data reduction , and source identification , and initial results on transient statistics .",
    "briefly , pigss is a 3.1 ghz survey of a large area of high galactic latitude sky conducted synoptically with 100  resolution and milli - jansky sensitivity .",
    "the pigss emphasis is on two surveys jointly conducted : 1 ) @xmath5 deg@xmath6 of the sky with @xmath7 ; and 2 ) individual @xmath8 deg@xmath6 fields that are observed repeatedly .",
    "paper i presented results from integrated results for a 11-deg@xmath6 field in the botes  constellation associated with the noao deep wide field survey ( ndwfs ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . numerous sensitive , large area surveys have been carried out for the botes  field , providing an important baseline for comparison with pigss results .",
    "we found no new radio sources that we could convincingly identify as rts .",
    "this sets an upper limit on the rt surface density at the millijansky flux limit .    in this paper , we present daily results from the botes  field .",
    "these consist of 78 individual epochs over five months .",
    "these observations provide a very sensitive probe of transient statistics .",
    "they also provide one of the first unbiased searches for variability in a sample of mjy brightness sources . in  [ sec : obs ] , we briefly review the observations and data analysis and present the full catalog of light curves . in  [ sec : transients ] , we present results on transient sources . in ",
    "[ sec : var ] , we characterize the variability of individual sources . in  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize our results .",
    "pigss observations of the botes  field were conducted between 2009 may 20 and 2009 september 29 .",
    "typical observations consisted of three 3-minute snapshots distributed over an observing epoch , which was between 4 and 12 hours in duration .",
    "the botes  observations were interleaved with those of a larger field .",
    "multiple hour angles were necessary to achieve good @xmath9-coverage for these complex fields .",
    "the botes  field consists of 7 individual pointings arranged in a close - packed hexagonal configuration with the central pointing located at @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( j2000 ) .",
    "pointings are separated by @xmath12 , the voltage full width half maximum at 3.14 ghz , which provides nearly uniform sensitivity in the central region of the field .",
    "observations were obtained in two separate frequency bands of 100-mhz width centered at 3.04 and 3.14 ghz .",
    "the digital correlator provided 1024 channels for each frequency band with all correlations between parallel- and cross - hand terms .",
    "the bright calibrator 3c 286 was observed hourly .",
    "data reduction was performed with standard techniques including flagging of bad data due to radio frequency interference , amplitude and phase calibration using 3c 286 , and imaging using the 2d fft .",
    "most analysis was performed with the miriad package @xcite .",
    "the clean images are convolved with a synthesized beam of @xmath13 .",
    "the majority of the reduction was performed with pipeline software @xcite although some of it required human intervention .",
    "individual pointings were stitched together into images using linear - mosaicking techniques .",
    "we refer the reader to paper i for further details of the reduction technique .",
    "we show a single - epoch image in fig .",
    "[ fig : image ] .",
    "the rms flux density in images from individual epochs has a minimum of 1.4 mjy , median of 2.8 mjy , and maximum of 4.7 mjy .",
    "90% of all images have an rms below 3.7 mjy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ) .",
    "these rms statistics differ from those presented in paper i due to a change in how we performed the clean on the images .",
    "we used a larger number of iterations ( 3000 ) for daily images in paper i , which reduced the image rms below theoretical expectations and lead to a systematic reduction of source flux densities ( by as much as a factor of 3 at flux densities around 10 mjy ) . in this paper",
    ", we stopped clean when the first negative component is reached .",
    "this typically occurred at fewer than 100 iterations .",
    "as we show below , the agreement between daily and deep flux densities is good .",
    "there is a bias of @xmath14 in the daily flux densities relative to the deep flux densities , which we think is an effect of @xmath9-coverage .",
    "we do not correct for that effect in these data because we are primarily interested in transient detections and light curve variability , which are insensitive to the absolute flux density .",
    "the median number of sources detected at a @xmath15 threshold per individual epoch is 30 and ranges from 17 to 69 .",
    "systematic variations in the rms with time are real and are due to changing performance of the array , small variations in the number of observations per epoch , and the variable interference environment .",
    "we also create monthly images of the field that are integrated over all epochs in the five - month span of these observations ( 2009 may through september ) .",
    "these images have a significant improvement in imaging quality due to the complete @xmath9-coverage .",
    "the rms for the monthly images from june to september ranges from 0.52 to 0.67 mjy ; the variation is representative of the range of daily epochs per month .",
    "the rms for the may epochs is 1.0 mjy due to the smaller number of epochs in this month ( 7 ) .",
    "the noise statistics from the monthly images are consistent with averaging of the daily data .",
    "the number of @xmath15 sources detected per month ranged from 83 to 171 .",
    "a table of 425 sources made from the deep image was presented in paper i. source finding in each epoch image was carried out using the miriad task sfind @xcite .",
    "we search for point sources down to a threshold of @xmath16 ; a higher threshold is employed for identifying transient sources as described below .",
    "additionally , light curves for sources from the deep image were generated by fitting 2d gaussians at the fixed positions of the sources from the deep images .",
    "errors are the rms background in the residual following removal of the best - fit 2d gaussian model .",
    "we plot mean flux densities for all sources from daily and monthly data against the deep image flux density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxflux ] ) .",
    "the plot demonstrates agreement between these three different measures of source flux density at the 10% level for most sources . in some sources",
    ", larger differences may be due to confusion in regions of complex sources .",
    "we extensively explored completeness of the deep pigss catalog in paper i. deviations from previous catalogs such as nvss and gb6 were explored for indication of transient sources ; the absence of these sources is a measure of the completeness at the threshold we explored . in this paper , we primarily compare individual epochs to the deep pigss field . as discussed below",
    ", the absence of transient candidates at our detection threshold indicates that the daily images are complete at the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "we use a detection threshold of @xmath15 for transient sources in this data set . with this threshold and 78 epochs of observation",
    ", we find that the number of false sources expected is @xmath17 .",
    "a @xmath18 threshold has an expectation of 0.4 false sources .",
    "it is important to use an accurate estimate of the background noise for this calculation .",
    "a 20% underestimate of @xmath19 will convert a @xmath18 source to @xmath15 .",
    "we use the rms background signal after model source subtraction from the sub - image associated with the source to provide our best estimate . for all sources in a typical epoch ,",
    "the rms deviation in the rms background estimates is @xmath20 of the mean rms background . since this rms deviation is much less than the",
    "20% required to convert @xmath18 fluctuations into @xmath15 `` detections , '' statistical uncertainties in the rms background or variations in the rms background across the field are unlikely to affect our rate of false positives .",
    "additionally , a systematic bias across the field towards underestimation of the rms noise could introduce a large number of false positives .",
    "the mean of the rms backgrounds is comparable to the rms estimated from a region without sources in each image ; the rms difference is @xmath21 of the mean rms .",
    "thus , we do not see a significant systematic bias in the rms estimate .",
    "our search through all epochs identified four @xmath15 sources that are well - fit as point sources and that are not associated with steady sources using a match radius of 60 .",
    "for each of these sources , we then require sources that are present in both frequency bands at the same location with consistent flux densities .",
    "this stage leads to rejection of all sources .",
    "if we reduce the threshold to @xmath18 , we find 29 point - like sources that are not matched to steady sources . of these ,",
    "15 sources survive the dual - frequency threshold .",
    "the much larger number of sources at this threshold indicates that we are underestimating the noise by @xmath22 or that errors in calibration or flagging are leading to image defects that we are detecting as sources .",
    "given the consistency of rms measurements discussed above , we attribute the higher number of @xmath18 sources to imaging defects .",
    "we take our threshold of @xmath15 with no transient detections as the definite threshold that we can accept .",
    "we conducted a search of the monthly images for transients at the @xmath15 threshold by comparing the monthly epoch catalogs with the deep catalog .",
    "several candidates are identified , however , inspection of the images reveals that these sources are identified in the individual epochs due to a different decomposition of complex sources .",
    "therefore , we report no rts with a timescale of 1 month in this data .",
    "we also investigate the reality of the candidate rt j143621 + 334120 identified in paper i. this source was identified in the deep image with flux density of @xmath23 mjy ( 4.3@xmath19 ) and had no counterpart in nvss or wsrt-1400 catalogs .",
    "we plot the light curve in the daily images at the position of this source in figure  [ fig : deeprtlc ] .",
    "there is no detection @xmath24 of a source in any given epoch or in any month .",
    "the highest flux density at the source position is in the september monthly image but examination of the image reveals it to be non - point - like and , therefore , difficult to unambiguously state as a real detection .",
    "it is clear from the light curve that the detection in the deep image is not the result of a transient event with a duration of less than 4 months . if it is a real source in the deep image , then it represents a longer timescale transient .",
    "the source is within 15  of two stars identified in sdss but we can not conclusively make an association .    in paper",
    "i we reported that the source gb6 j142554 + 343552 had no counterparts in the deep pigss image and other radio surveys .",
    "we note here that the source appears in the original gb6 catalog with a warning flag , and is , therefore , likely to be spurious .",
    "we construct upper limits on the rt surface density using the same formalism developed in paper i and other papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that we are using the term surface density for clarity rather than two - epoch snapshot - rate , although these terms are interchangeable .",
    "the limit from this search is based on 78 epochs of observation , the rms as a function of epoch , the total area observed , and the limit of no rt detections in these data .",
    "the surface density is applicable to the characteristic timescale of @xmath25 day from these observations .",
    "we find a limit for flux densities greater than 15 mjy of @xmath26 deg@xmath1 and for flux densities greater than 100 mjy of @xmath27 deg@xmath1 .",
    "these are @xmath0 limits on the transient surface density .",
    "these limits represent a nearly two - order of magnitude improvement in the surface density limit on the results reported in paper i. from the monthly data , we estimate @xmath0 upper limits of 0.18 deg@xmath1 at 5 mjy and @xmath28 deg@xmath1 at 100 mjy .",
    "we plot the surface density limits against other surveys in figure  [ fig : surfacedensity ] .",
    "the upper limits on surface density from this search are consistent with upper limits from previous searches with the ata @xcite and with other instruments and archival data @xcite .",
    "the upper limits confirm the previous result of rejection of the detection of 1-jy rts reported in numerous papers @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the surface density reported in these papers is mis - stated ; they estimate a rate that is two orders of magnitude lower than reported .",
    "as we have noted in the previous papers , the atats and 3c 286 surveys clearly rule out the quoted rate .",
    "the new pigss results also rule out the stated rate .",
    "these results also explore similar parameter space to work based on the most archive @xcite .",
    "the pigss upper limit is comparable to the detection rate from most .",
    "in fact , the most results suggest that pigss should have detected @xmath29 rt at 50 mjy",
    ". the absence of these sources could be the result of two factors : the difference in observing frequency between the two surveys ( 0.84 ghz versus 3.1 ghz ) , and , two , the absence of a deep image in the most archival data that prevents separation of transient sources from strongly variable sources .",
    "the pigss non - detection are consistent with an extrapolation of the b07 detection rate to higher flux density thresholds ; that is , the b07 rate predicts no transients in the data reported in this paper .    the limits on surface density presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : surfacedensity ] ignore a number of significant differences between surveys .",
    "b07 , @xcite , and the pigss results are all at frequencies greater than 1.4 ghz , where greater variability is expected .",
    "the surveys all have different cadences and different sensitivities to certain time scales .",
    "as @xcite shows for the case of tidal disruption events , translation of the surface density into limits on physical source populations requires consideration of both the observing frequency and the timescale of observations .",
    "we examined the light curves for evidence of systematic variations that are common to all sources as a function of epoch using two methods .",
    "neither method improved on the overall quality of results and for some sources appeared to introduce distortions in the light curves that worsened the results .",
    "in the first method , we used a sum of the flux densities of the brightest sources to normalize the flux densities of all sources .",
    "we varied the number of sources from the brightest five to the brightest fifty .",
    "there were reductions at the 20% in the scatter for the brightest sources but at the cost of potentially introducing distortions in the light curves , and required assuming constant flux density for these sources . in the second method",
    ", we performed a linear fit between the deep flux density and the epoch flux density for all sources brighter than 10 mjy in each epoch .",
    "the rms of the corrections to the flux densities was 4% , which would only be significant for the brightest sources and introduced similar issues to the normalization scheme described above .",
    "therefore , we decided not to apply these corrections .",
    "this analysis does confirm a bias in the daily flux densities of @xmath14 , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "we summarize the statistics that we compute below for all sources in table  [ tab : stats ] .",
    "columns are ( 1 ) the source name , ( 2 ) primary - beam corrected flux density from the deep image in mjy , @xmath30 , ( 3 ) primary beam gain , ( 4 ) daily reduced @xmath31 , ( 5 ) monthly reduced @xmath31 , ( 6 ) daily rms fractional modulation , ( 7 ) monthly rms fractional modulation , ( 8 - 9 ) minimum and maximum of daily fractional modulation , and ( 10 - 11 ) minimum and maximum of monthly fractional modulation .",
    "see below for definition of these terms .",
    "the reduced @xmath31 for the hypothesis of constant flux density is an established measure of variability . we plot histograms of the reduced @xmath31 for the daily and monthly epochs in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "the histogram for the daily data is dominated by the large number of sources that are undetected or marginally detected .",
    "the peak of the distribution is @xmath32 and there is a tail to @xmath33 . for the large number of degrees of freedom in this data , even small deviations from 1 are significant .",
    "a value of @xmath34 corresponds to greater than 99.7% certainty in rejection of the hypothesis .",
    "thus , 88/425 sources qualify as significantly variable on a daily timescale .",
    "the monthly data have lower errors and , therefore , more clearly identify variable sources .",
    "63/425 sources have @xmath35 , corresponding again to 99.7% certainty of variability .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath22 of sources are variable .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite that @xmath36 of sources brighter than 1.8 mjy are variable .",
    "the rms fractional modulation is the ratio of the rms flux density to the mean flux density : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the flux density in individual epochs , @xmath39 is the mean flux density and @xmath40 is a weighting factor equal to the inverse rms noise squared .",
    "we calculate this value for the monthly ( @xmath41 ) and daily ( @xmath42 ) data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation ] ) .",
    "the daily statistic is the same as the ratio of the standard deviation to flux density reported by @xcite . for the majority of sources , @xmath43 .",
    "the dominant effect producing this is the lower signal to noise ratio and the more limited @xmath9 coverage of the daily data .",
    "the solid curves in the plot correspond to rms fractional modulations that are three times the median rms noise for the daily and monthly data .",
    "strongly variable sources are those that are significantly above these curves .",
    "we also see that the rms fractional modulation on the two time scales is correlated , with @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modulation ] ) .",
    "this ratio is expected based on the ratios of the median rms between monthly and daily epochs ( which is also consistent with the noise decreasing as the number of epochs squared ) .",
    "here we plot only the sources for which the mean monthly flux exceeds 2 mjy .",
    "this excludes sources that are only marginally detected in the monthly images but permits inclusion of sources strongly variable on daily timescales .",
    "sources that fall far off this line are of interest as strongly variable on one timescale but not the other .    in figure",
    "[ fig : steady ] we show example light curves for sources that are not strongly variable in our data .",
    "these four sources were selected as those showing the smallest @xmath42 .",
    "this selection biases in favor of the brightest sources in the sample .",
    "these sources are also among the least active on monthly time scales as well , although the relationship between daily and monthly rms fractional modulation is not one - to - one .",
    "for instance , j143012 + 331444 has the minimum @xmath41 of all sources ( 0.01 ) but has @xmath45 .",
    "error bars are large in the case of j143317 + 345121 due to confusion with an adjacent bright source .    in figure",
    "[ fig : var ] we show examples of sources with the strongest variability as measured by @xmath42 .",
    "we restrict this sample to sources with mean flux density @xmath46 mjy and within the inner part of the region such that the primary beam correction is less than 4 .",
    "these restrictions provide a clean set of data in which pointing effects and low signal to noise ratio will not introduce significant variations in the flux density .",
    "the maximum @xmath42 in these subset is 0.30 for j142632 + 350831 .",
    "the rms fractional modulation is a good statistic for characterizing overall variability but it may not capture episodic variability .",
    "for instance , a factor of 2 flare with a duration of a few days would have a small impact on the rms fractional modulation over the full data set .",
    "such considerations are important when thinking about the identification of rare events .",
    "the fractional modulation is defined as the ratio of variability of each epoch to the deep flux density for that source : @xmath47 we create histograms for the daily ( @xmath48 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxhistdaily ] ) and monthly fractional modulations ( @xmath49 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxhistmonthly ] ) , summarizing the variability for all sources and all epochs together .",
    "these histograms are averaged over decade ranges in flux density .",
    "we also tabulate the probability of exceeding a fractional modulation in table  [ tab : fluxhist ] .",
    "these results incorporate @xmath50 flux density measurements . in the case of the monthly modulations for @xmath51",
    "mjy , there are a limited number of measurements , leading to a rather poorly characterized distribution .",
    "it is again clear from these data that the monthly modulations are significantly lower than the daily modulations .",
    "this is in part due to the lower signal to noise ratio and possibly the poorer @xmath9-coverage and greater systematic errors of the daily detections .",
    "this effect is very clearly evident in the daily modulations for sources with @xmath52 mjy .",
    "the majority of these sources are not detected in most , if not all , epochs .",
    "the histogram therefore represents the noise statistics more than the results .",
    "we fit a gaussian to the distribution as an estimate of the noise contribution .",
    "we see that this fit reasonably well represents the central portion of the distributions .",
    "there are long tails to all the fits that are either the results of individual measurements with large errors , systematic errors , or real variability in the source population .",
    "very large variations indicated in the histogram , for instance , could be the result of individual epochs with a flux density measurement that is not statistically significant in its difference from the mean but shows up as a large fractional modulation relative to the deep flux .",
    "another way of stating this is that the gaussian fit to the distribution estimates the noise properties only under the assumption of uniform errors for all sources in all epochs .",
    "it is also important to note that @xmath53 corresponds to a negative flux density , which occurs for sources near the flux density limit threshold .",
    "thus , the distribution of negative values in the histogram can be considered a bound on real activity in the sources .",
    "conservatively , we state that the variability characterized here sets an upper limit to the variable source population .",
    "the limits are nevertheless quite strong . among the brightest sources @xmath54 mjy , the probability of a daily variation @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "for the faintest sources , @xmath52 mjy , the probability of @xmath57 is @xmath58 .",
    "a similar limit holds for sources in the range @xmath59 mjy .",
    "very large variations ( @xmath60 ) in the monthly data do not occur and we set an upper limit of fewer than @xmath61 such events .",
    "these limits can be considered an alternative characterization of the transient rate for flux - limited surveys without a reference deep image in which strongly variable sources can exceed the flux threshold and appear as transient sources .",
    "variability of this kind could account for some fraction of the population reported by @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : var1 ] , we plot light curves for variable sources selected on the basis of their maximum daily fractional modulation and appying the same restrictions to the data as for the rms fractional modulation ( @xmath62 mjy and gain factor less than 4 ) .",
    "we select nine sources with @xmath63 . of these , 6 are in common with those selected by the rms fractional modulation .",
    "we plot the remaining three sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : var1 ] .",
    "these sources have a maximum @xmath64 of 0.81 but @xmath65 .",
    "one can see clear evidence of episodic variations with a duration of days in the light curves of these sources that stands out from otherwise stable light curves .",
    "this maximum value for @xmath64 is not the maximum seen in the histograms of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the most variable sources fall outside of the criteria we used for selecting these sources ; that is , these sources are less than 30 mjy and/or have gain factors greater than 4 .",
    "are these flux density variations real ?",
    "we plot light curves for sources with @xmath66 and @xmath67 mjy in fig .",
    "[ fig : var2 ] .",
    "these seven sources have a maximum @xmath68 , which is representative of the distribution of the most variable sources .",
    "we see strong modulation on a range of timescales in these sources .",
    "the structure function , @xmath69 , is the variance over a range of characteristic time scale , @xmath70 .",
    "the rms fractional modulation calculated on daily and monthly time scales can be construed as limiting cases of the structure function .",
    "we use the same analytic form for the structure function as @xcite .",
    "we produced structure functions for each source over time scales of 1 to 55 days .",
    "the maximum time scale is half of the total duration of the observations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfunex ] , we show examples of structures selected from sources with the highest and lowest daily rms modulation fractions . since the rms modulation fraction is an absolute quantity , we see evidence of variability timescales even for sources that have low rms modulation fraction .",
    "the results are remarkably flat and independent of time scale .",
    "we calculated power - law fits to the structure function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] ) .",
    "the range of power - law indices is -0.1 to 0.15 , indicating that the light curves do not evolve significantly on time scales greater than a few days , typically .",
    "note that a linear increase in flux density over this period would have an index 2 .",
    "we also computed the time scale of the peak of each structure function and find that those peaks are distributed over the full range of time scales .",
    "about half of the peaks are at timescales less than 5 days .",
    "we identified sources with the largest peak structure function values .",
    "of the top eight , only two were not identifed by any of our previous methods .",
    "we plot these two in fig .",
    "[ fig : var3 ] .",
    "these have characteristic timescales at their peaks of a few days .",
    "others identified through this method have peak timescales as long as 55 days . given the flat distribution of @xmath69 , many of these long timescale fluctuations may not be statistically significant .",
    "we also fit the function @xmath71 , which is characteristic of the fluctuations expected from interstellar scintillation ( iss ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find that @xmath72 days for all sources , with a median value @xmath73 day .",
    "overall , the bias to short timescales is consistent with the findings of @xcite for the bright source population probed by the masiv survey and to the fainter source population studied by @xcite .",

    "as figure  [ fig : var3 ] shows , there are some sources that exhibit strong variability that is statistically significant . what remains to be seen from this list of highly variable objects",

    "the largest amplitude fluctuations ( @xmath123 ) occur fewer than 1 in @xmath5 source - days .",
    "evla characterization of a subset of these sources is important for determining the effect of systematic errors in some of the larger variations reported here . while these statistics are of the most use for broadly characterizing the population , certain classes of objects are better identified with matched filtering techniques .",
    "for instance , extreme scattering events and radio supernovae have reasonably well - defined and parametrizable light curves which could be used to explore these data sets in greater depth .",
    "future explorations of data of this kind should include matched filter analysis .",
    "the pigss results in the botes  field represent approximately 20% of the data from the pigss project and were obtained in the early phases of routine telescope operations .",
    "subsequent analysis of higher quality daily observations in the lockman hole , elais , and the coma cluster will probe significantly deeper into the radio transient and variable population .",
    "pigss observations will also characterize variability on time scales of 1 year for @xmath124 radio sources in the north galactic cap .",
    "the limits we have placed are useful constraints on the population of active high energy objects in the universe .",

    "<S> approximately 20% of the sources exhibit some variability on daily and monthly time scales . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum rms fractional modulations on the 1 day and 1 month time scales for sources brighter than 10 mjy are 2 and 0.5 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of a daily fluctuation for all sources and all epochs by a factor of 10 is less than @xmath2 . </S>",
