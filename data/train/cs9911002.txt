    "in particular , we show that @xmath16 is rational ( this kind of result is also discussed in @xcite ) . using classical results about rational series",
    ", we obtain a generalization of the fact given in @xcite that ultimately periodic sets are @xmath13-recognizable for any numeration system @xmath13 .",
    "our main purpose is related to the stability of the @xmath13-recognizability under arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication by a constant .",
    "if addition preserves the @xmath13-recognizability then multiplication by @xmath17 also preserves the @xmath13-recognizability .",
    "so , a natural question about the stability of the recognizability arises .",
    "when does the multiplication by an integer @xmath18 preserve the recognizability ?",
    "it is well known that for positional numeration systems in base @xmath19 the problem of addition and multiplication by a constant is completely settled .",
    "the @xmath19-recognizable sets are exactly those defined in the first order structure @xmath20 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is obvious that addition and multiplication by a constant are definable in the presburger arithmetic .",
    "therefore , @xmath19-recognizability is preserved .    on the other hand , using the specific structure of the language @xmath21 , it is shown in @xcite that for the numeration system @xmath22 , the multiplication by a non - negative integer @xmath18 transforms the @xmath13-recognizable sets into @xmath13-recognizable sets if and only if @xmath18 is a perfect square .",
    "then the multiplication by @xmath17 does not preserve @xmath13-recognizability .",
    "notice that the language @xmath21 has a polynomial complexity ( the complexity function @xmath23 of a language @xmath2 counts the number of words of length @xmath24 in @xmath2 ) .",
    "so , it is natural to check whether a numeration system on a polynomial language preserves the recognizability of a set after multiplication by a constant . for @xmath21 , perfect squares play a special role .",
    "does there exist a similar set for an arbitrary language in @xmath3 ? we get the following result : if @xmath13 is a numeration system built on a regular language with complexity in @xmath3 then the multiplication by @xmath18 preserves the recognizability only if @xmath5 for some integer @xmath25 . as a consequence , the addition can not be a regular map for numeration systems on polynomial regular languages .    in order to prove this",
    ", we proceed in two steps . in section [ ns3 ]",
    ", we assume that the complexity of the language is a polynomial of degree @xmath26 with rational coefficients .",
    "with such a language , we exhibit a subset @xmath27 which is recognizable and we prove that @xmath28 is not recognizable for any @xmath29 . in section [ ns4 ] , we consider the general case .    in this study of polynomial regular languages , we have obtained a interesting result about a special sequence associated to a language .",
