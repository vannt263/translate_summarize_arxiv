    "the isotope @xmath0he probably first entered the astrophysical arena in 1949 with the ( unpublished ) calculations of fermi & turkevich concerning the chemical evolution of the first half - hour of the universe .",
    "the names `` tralphium '' and `` tralpha particles '' invented by george gamow for this isotope and its nuclei , have survived only in his humourous description of nucleogenesis : _ and god said : `` let there be mass three . '' and there was mass three .",
    "and god saw tritium and tralphium , and they were good_. and so on to transuranium elements , with fred hoyle s help to bridge the gap at mass five ( kragh  1996 ) .",
    "the rough estimate of by fermi & turkevich ( @xmath1 by mass ) was later refined by more detailed calculations , like e.g. those of wagoner , fowler , & hoyle  ( 1967 ) who showed that @xmath0he could be produced at levels comparable to its terrestrial abundance ( @xmath2 by mass ) during the evolution of a `` universal fireball or a supermassive object '' , or , as we say today , in the big bang .",
    "thus , at least in principle , the abundance of @xmath0he could be used ( together with d , @xmath3he and li ) to test theoretical predictions , and , in particular , to constrain the baryon density of the universe .",
    "having gained the special status of `` cosmic baryometer '' and caught the attention of cosmologists , the interest in @xmath0he spread rapidly in the astronomical community .",
    "at around the same time , iben ( 1967 ) and truran & cameron ( 1971 ) showed that ordinary stars produce @xmath0he in the ashes of hydrogen burning by @xmath4@xmath4 cycle on the main sequence .",
    "they found that the stellar production of @xmath0he roughly scales as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the mass of the star , indicating that low - mass stars ( @xmath73 @xmath8 ) are the dominant site of @xmath0he production in the galaxy .",
    "problems followed soon , when rood , steigman , & tinsley ( 1976 ) incorporated the stellar production of @xmath0he in simple models of galactic chemical evolution , and found the predicted present - day abundances to be larger by orders of magnitude than the value measured in samples of gas - rich meteorites , representative of interstellar medium abundances at the time of formation of the sun .",
    "the paper by rood , steigman , & tinsley ( 1976 ) marked the first appearance of the `` @xmath0he problem '' .",
    "however , additional observations of @xmath0he in the galaxy were needed to confirm the exent of the discrepancy .",
    "radioastronomers first learned of @xmath0he in 1955 at the fourth i.a.u .",
    "symposium in jodrell bank , when the frequency of the hyperfine @xmath0he@xmath9 line at 8.666 ghz ( 3.46 cm ) was included by charles townes in a list of `` radio - frequency lines of interest to astronomy '' ( townes  1957 ) .",
    "the line was ( probably ) detected for the first time only twenty years later , by rood , wilson & steigman  ( 1979 ) in w51 , opening the way to the determination of the @xmath0he abundance in the interstellar gas of our galaxy via direct ( although technically challenging ) radioastronomical observations . in the last two decades",
    ", a considerable collection of @xmath0he@xmath9 abundance determinations has been assembled in hii regions and planetary nebulae .",
    "the relevance of these results will be discussed in sect .  4 and 5 respectively .",
    "for many years , meteorites have provided the only means to determine the abundance of @xmath0he in protosolar material .",
    "the values obtained by mass spectroscopy techniques in the so - called `` planetary '' component of gas - rich meteorites have been critically examined by geiss  ( 1993 ) and galli et al .",
    "the latter recommend the value @xmath0he/@xmath3he@xmath10 .",
    "the meteoritic value has been confirmed by _ in situ _ measurement of the he isotopic ratio in the atmosphere of jupiter by the galileo probe mass spectrometer . the isotopic ratio obtained in this way , @xmath0he/@xmath3he@xmath11 ( mahaffy et al . 1998 ) , is slightly larger than , but consistent with , the ratio measured in meteorites , reflecting possible fractionation in the protosolar gas in favor of the the heavier isotope , or differential depletion in jupiter s atmosphere .",
    "the he isotopic ratio in the present day local ism ( inside and beyond the heliosphere at 35 au from the sun ) has been determined by two recent space experiments , and the two results agree within the uncertainties .",
    "helium atoms entering the solar system from the surrounding interstellar cloud and ionized deep inside the heliosphere ( the so - called `` pick - up ''",
    "ions ) , analyzed by the solar wind ion composition spectrometer on the ulysses spacecraft , show an isotopic ratio @xmath0he/@xmath3he@xmath12 , with the uncertainty resulting almost entirely from statistical error ( gloecker & geiss 1998 ) . in the collisa experiment on the russian space station mir , on the other hand , samples of the local _ neutral _ ism were collected on thin metal foils exposed to the flux of interstellar particles , and later analyzed in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "the he isotopic ratio measured in this way is @xmath0he/@xmath3he @xmath13 ( salerno et al .",
    "the old problems have now largely been overcome , and new ones have appeared . as for the cosmological implications ,",
    "thanks to the continuing effort of rood and collaborators over more than two decades to determine @xmath0he abundances in hii regions ( see contribution by bania et al . in these proceedings ) , the usefulness of this isotope as a cosmic baryometer has now been fully established .",
    "the trend ( or better , the absence of a trend ) of @xmath0he vs. metallicity in a sample of about 40 hii regions reveals the existence of a `` @xmath0he plateau '' at @xmath0he / h@xmath14 , similar in many ways to the celebrated `` li plateau '' .",
    "the resulting baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath15 ( bania , rood & balser 2002 ) is in agreement with other independent determinations of this fundamental cosmological parameter .",
    "after fifty years , the program started by fermi & turkevich s theoretical prediction of `` tralphium '' production in the early universe seems to have reached its fulfillment .    as for the discrepancy between observed abundances of @xmath0he and the predictions of models of galactic chemical evolution , the natural explanation of the problem was found by charbonnel  ( 1995 ) and hogan  ( 1995 ) in the existence of a non - standard mixing mechanism acting in low - mass stars during the red - giant branch evolution or later , leading to a substancial ( or complete ) destruction of all their freshly produced @xmath0he . in this way",
    ", the `` @xmath0he problem '' was reduced to `` just another '' isotopic anomaly , similar to those commonly observed in the atmospheres of giant stars for elements like carbon and oxygen , as originally suggested by rood , bania & wilson  ( 1984 ) almost ten years earlier .",
    "the characteristics of this mixing mechanism , and the attempts to identify a physical mechanism responsible for its occurrence ( rotation ? ) have been nicely reviewed by charbonnel  ( 1998 ) , and will not be repeated here . for an impressive demonstration of the effects of extra - mixing on the carbon isotopic ratio in globular cluster stars ,",

    "2003 ) is indicated by an attow at @xmath19 . taken together , the observational data support the hypothesis that negligible changes of the abundance of @xmath0he have occurred in the galaxy during the past 4.55 gyr .",
    "the failure of the standard @xmath0he yields to account for the measured abundances is not a peculiarity of the particular galactic model shown in fig .  1",
    ", as the interested reader may see in fig .  6 of tosi  ( 1998 ) .",
    "it should be noted however that the discrepancy with the observational data is rather model dependent .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ evolution ] that consistency with the observed abundance of @xmath0he in the galaxy is achieved only if the fraction of low - mass stars ( @xmath20 ) undergoing extra - mixing is larger than @xmath21% , assuming the @xmath0he yields of boothroyd & sackmann ( 1999 ) .",
    "thus , to solve the @xmath0he problem in terms of extra - mixing in low - mass stars , the vast majority of them ( 90%100% ) must be affected by this phenomenon ( galli et al .",

    "the most direct , model independent , way to test the validity of the mixing solution is to measure the @xmath0he abundance in the ejecta of low - mass stars , i.e. in planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "the search for @xmath0he in the ejecta of pne via the 8.667 ghz spin - flip transition of @xmath0he@xmath9 , painstakingly carried out by rood and coworkers at the green bank radiotelescope since 1992 ( see summary of results in balser et al .  1997 ) , has produced so far _ one solid detection _",
    "( ngc  3242 , see rood , bania , & wilson  1992 ; confirmed with the effelsberg radiotelescope by balser , rood , & bania  1999 ) , _ two tentative detections _ ( ic  289 , ngc  6720 ) and _ three upper limits _",
    "( ngc  7662 , ngc  6543 , ngc  7009 ) . one more detection has been recently obtained with the nrao vla in the pn j320 ( balser et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "all these objects can be placed in the progenitor mass@xmath0he diagram ( see details of the procedure in galli et al .",
    "1997 ) , and compared with the predictions of stellar models with and without extra - mixing ( fig .  [ pn ] ) .",
    "ironically enough , the position of the six pne definitely supports the standard @xmath0he yields , in particular the ( only ) solid detection of the sample , ngc  3242 .",
    "although the statistical significance of the sample is questionable , and selection biases are certainly present , the only way to reconcile fig .  1 with fig .  2 is to conclude that most , if not all , the pne shown in fig .  [ pn ] belong to the @xmath23% ( or less ) of low - mass stars which did _ not _ experience extra - mixing .",
    "we have learned many things about gamow s tralphium since 1949 .",
    "a personal selection includes : ( 1 ) the abundance of @xmath0he has not changed significantly over @xmath24  gyr of galactic evolution , which is remarkable ; ( 2 ) it has not changed not because nothing happened , but because two independent processes of opposite sign and equal magnitude were at work , which is _ truly _ remarkable ; ( 3 ) one object does not make a statistically significant sample ; ( 4 ) many objects do not make it either , if they are selected carefully enough .",
