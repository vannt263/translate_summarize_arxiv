    "impurity effects on quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets with a spin gap due to the topological structure of the system have attracted much interest in relation to the impurity - induced antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order ( lro ) observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "there are two types of disorders , i.e. , site dilution and bond dilution .",
    "extensive theoretical and numerical works have investigated properties of diluted heisenberg antiferromagnets in the one - dimensional ( 1d )  @xcite and two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems . in the latter , however , the interchain interactions have been treated by the mean - field - type approximations  @xcite , so that the difference of these two types of disorders can not be naturally introduced . in the present paper",
    "we have investigated bond - dilution effects on the spin-1/2 spin - gapped af heisenberg system by treating the interchain interactions on the equal footing as the intrachain interactions by means of the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method .",
    "the result obtained clearly reveals the different aspects between magnetic properties of the bond- and site - diluted systems .",
    "the site - dilution effects have been already extensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "if spins are randomly removed from the lattice , magnetic moments are induced at sites neighboring the removed sites .",
    "we have called the domain of induced magnetic moments the ` effective spin ' .",
    "they situate centered at sites next to each removed spin , and their extent is given by the correlation lengths , @xmath1 , of the non - diluted system . the effective exchange coupling between two effective spins centered at sites @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is given by @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the distance between the effective spins  @xcite . there",
    "exist strong correlations between the effective spins retaining the staggeredness with respect to the original lattice  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 2d site - diluted system has an af lro induced with an _ infinitesimal _ concentration of dilution at zero temperature .",
    "on the other hand , if a certain bond is removed from the lattice , the effective spins , peaks of which are located at both ends of the diluted bond , are induced . in this case , besides the same interaction @xmath6 between spins next to different removed bonds as in the site - diluted case , there exist af interactions @xmath7 between two spins at both ends of a removed strong bond through the 2d shortest paths .",
    "the latter is estimated of the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the strength of the interchain interaction and the strength of the stronger intrachain interaction is put unity . in the small concentration region with @xmath10 , therefore it is expected that the singlet pair is reformed by @xmath7 . as @xmath11 is increased",
    ", @xmath6 becomes dominant to @xmath7 . as a result",
    ", the af lro is expected to occur above a _",
    "finite _ critical concentration @xmath0 in the bond - diluted case .",
    "this scenario is clearly confirmed by the present work .",
    "we investigate the bond - diluted quantum af heisenberg model of coupled alternating chains on a square lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where 1 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the af intrachain alternating coupling constants , @xmath9 ( @xmath14 ) the af interchain coupling constant , and @xmath15 the quantum spin operator with @xmath16 at site ( @xmath17 ) . randomly quenched bond occupation factors \\{@xmath18 } independently take either 1 or 0 with probability @xmath19 and @xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath11 is the concentratin of diluted bonds . the pure system described by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) with @xmath20 for all bonds is in a spin - gapped or an af lro phase depending on strengths of @xmath13 and @xmath9 at zero temperature  @xcite . in the @xmath21 system which we examine in the present work there",
    "exists the spin - gapped phase below @xmath22 .",
    "the qmc simulations with the continuous - imaginary - time loop algorithm  @xcite are carried out on @xmath23 square lattices with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "for each sample with a bond - diluted configuration , @xmath24 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) are spent for measurement after @xmath25 mcs for thermalization .",
    "sample average for dilution is taken over @xmath26 samples .",
    "systems with @xmath27 .",
    "there exists the critical concentration of @xmath28 in the bond - diluted system .",
    "the percolation thresholds on the bond and site processes are denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "all the lines are guides to eyes . ]",
    "the @xmath11 dependences of the staggered magnetization @xmath31 in the bond- and site - diluted  @xcite systems with @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "if the pure system with the spin - gapped state is diluted , the af lro is induced at a certain concentration in both site- and bond - diluted cases . however , whereas the site - diluted system is driven into the af lro phase by an infinitesimal concentration , in the bond - diluted system there exists a critical concentration of @xmath28 even for @xmath27 , which is the system near the critical point @xmath32 for @xmath21 and @xmath33 . as the value of @xmath9 becomes smaller , the region of the disordered phase , i.e. , the value of @xmath0 increases due to the reduction of @xmath34 , e.g. , @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "and @xmath36 at @xmath37 . ]     and @xmath36 at @xmath37 . ]    for the coupled alternating chains considered in the present work there exist three types of bonds , whose strengths are 1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "if a weaker bond with @xmath13 or @xmath9 is removed , the singlet pairs on the strong bonds are not disturbed at all and so magnetic moments are not induced . however ,",
    "if a strong bond is removed , magnetic moments are induced at both ends of the diluted bond . in fig .",
    "2(a ) the real - space distribution of the local static staggered structure factor defined by @xmath38 is shown for @xmath21 and @xmath36 on a 64 @xmath39 64 lattice from which 15 strong bonds are removed .",
    "we can clearly see that magnetic moments are always induced in pairs at both ends of the removed bonds .",
    "this is a different situation from the site dilution for which isolated magnetic moments are induced next to each diluted site  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the real - space distribution of the staggered correlation function , @xmath40 , exhibits no af lro , where 0 ( = ( 29,31 ) ) is the peak site of an effective spin .",
    "( the reader may compare it with the af lro in the site - diluted case in ref .",
    "in such a small concentration region with @xmath10 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 for @xmath21 and @xmath36 , the spins correlate only with the neighboring spins . in the concentration region of @xmath43 , on the other hand , the effective spins practically overlap each other and the af lro is induced .     in the extremely - low - concentration region for @xmath21 .",
    "a line with the slope of 1.5 is the guide to eyes . ]",
    "next we investigate whether or not there is the spin - gapped phase in the disordered phase by means of the moment method  @xcite .",
    "we have found that in the extremely - low - concentration region there exists a spin gap , @xmath44 , whose magnitude is independent of the value of @xmath11 and proportional to @xmath8 as shown in fig .",
    "this relation tells that , as mentioned in introduction , two edge spins induced at both ends of a diluted bond reform a singlet pair due to the effective interaction @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) through the 2d shortest paths .",
    "we note here that since induced magnetic moments are located at sites of the different sublattices , the interaction is always af .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased , @xmath44 deviates from the proportionality to @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that the localized singlet picture does not hold well for larger values of @xmath9 .     for @xmath21 and @xmath36 .",
    "in the inset @xmath47 are shown at @xmath48 , 0.02 , 0.01 , and 0 from top .",
    "all the lines are guides to eyes . ]    in the inset of fig .",
    "4 the @xmath49 dependence of the effective curie constant @xmath50 for @xmath21 and @xmath36 is shown at @xmath48 , 0.02 , 0.01 , and 0 from top .",
    "the uniform susceptibility @xmath51 exponentially decreases at low temperatures due to the spin gap with the value of 0.31415(2 ) . in the main frame of fig .",
    "4 , the differences @xmath52 are shown .",
    "the plateau with the curie constant proportional to @xmath11 is clearly seen in these plots and @xmath52 falls off exponentially at lower temperature than @xmath53 .",
    "this confirms again the existence of the spin gap due to @xmath45 at relatively small @xmath11 .",
    "when bonds are randomly removed in the spin - gapped phase , the af effective interaction @xmath45 between two spins at both ends of a removed strong bond is induced in addition to the effective interaction @xmath6 between spins on ends of different removed bonds .",
    "therefore , in such a low - concentration region that the strength of @xmath45 is larger than @xmath54 there exists the spin - gapped phase dominated by @xmath45 .",
    "the ground state of the diluted dimerized 1d system with @xmath55 and @xmath56 is in the quantum griffiths phase , which is characterized by the finite correlation length and the gapless excitation . in the present 2d system with @xmath57",
    "our numerical results strongly suggest a gapless phase but without af lro just below @xmath0 . the problem will be discussed elsewhere .",
