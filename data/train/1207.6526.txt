    "in polycristalline materials that consist of multiple crystalline grains of the same thermodynamic phase , the grain size and texture of the material largely determine mechanical properties such as toughness and yield stress .",
    "therefore , a large effort has been devoted to understanding the relation between the processing conditions during solidification and subsequent ageing of a material and the resulting grain structure . from a fundamental viewpoint , this is an example of self - organization @xcite : a complex structure emerges from a structureless initial state ( the liquid ) , and the resulting network of grain boundaries evolves with time and coarsens @xcite .    despite a large body of work ,",
    "many questions regarding this self - organization process remain open . as often in such complex problems",
    ", a comparison between experiments and numerical modeling could be highly useful .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to develop quantitative modeling tools for the solidification and evolution of polycristalline materials . among the many modelling approaches ,",
    "the phase - field method has rapidly gained in popularity in recent years due to its versatility and robustness . for recent reviews on its applications in materials science ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "numerous phase - field models for the description of polycristalline solidification and grain growth have already been developed .",
    "they can be grouped in two categories . in the so - called multi - phase - field approach @xcite",
    ", each grain is described by an individual phase field .",
    "the grain boundary energies are determined by the coupling between the phase fields . despite the necessity to handle a large number of phase fields",
    ", this approach can be made quite efficient from a numerical point of view @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it suffers from the fact that for each simulation the coupling coefficients between the phase fields need to be computed ( and stored ) in order to reproduce the proper grain boundary energies @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the crystalline orientation in each grain is fixed , phenomena such as grain rotation and plastic deformation can not easily be described . finally , from a fundamental point of view",
    ", a large number of fields certainly does not constitute the most `` economic '' description of a polycristalline structure , since the state of matter in any space point can be specified by a set of a few variables , such as the degree of order and the local lattice orientation .    as a consequence of the latter consideration",
    ", alternative models have been developed that use a single phase field coupled to an orientation field @xcite .",
    "the phase field describes the local thermodynamic state ",
    "either solid ( @xmath0 ) or liquid ( @xmath1 )  and the orientation field is used to describe the local orientation of the crystallographic axes in the solid with respect to some fixed reference system . in two dimensions ,",
    "the orientation field is simply an angle @xmath2 , while in three dimension a more complex formalism is needed @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "a grain boundary is a diffuse but localized region in space between two regions of the same thermodynamic state ( both are solid ) but different crystalline orientations .",
    "the change of the crystalline orientation is concentrated in the grain boundary where the phase field is no longer equal to @xmath3 .",
    "while this kind of description is appealing , it turns out that the construction of a viable model is far from simple because of the need to obtain localized grain boundaries .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case with a scalar angle field and try to construct a free energy functional that leads to localized solid - liquid interfaces and grain boundaries .",
    "for the solid - liquid interfaces , this is straightforward : since there are two privileged and distinct thermodynamic states ( solid and liquid ) , diffuse interfaces arise from the free energy balance between a double - well potential and a square - gradient term for the phase field . in the case of grain boundaries",
    ", matters are not so simple .",
    "indeed , there is no privileged angle and the free energy must be rotationally invariant .",
    "therefore , a potential that depends on the angle is forbidden , and only terms that contain spatial derivatives of @xmath4 can be used in the free energy .",
    "then , in order to model localized grain boundaries , at a first glance it seems sufficient to introduce a term that couples the energy cost of angular variations to the local value of the phase field and induces a sufficiently high energy penalty for angle variations in the solid .",
    "however , a simple scaling argument , reviewed in detail below , shows that localized grain boundaries can not be obtained by a straightforward coupling of a square - gradient term in @xmath4 to the phase field .",
    "in fact , such a model is equivalent to the usual thermodynamic description of nematic liquid crystals @xcite , in which indeed no `` grain boundaries '' ( localized changes in the director field ) exist .",
    "the solution proposed in the previous orientation - field models is to include an additional term proportional to @xmath5 in the free energy .",
    "localized grain boundaries then arise from the balance between this term and the square gradient in @xmath4 .",
    "while this approach yields localized grain boundaries , it also has several problems .",
    "first , from a fundamental viewpoint it seems difficult to justify such a form in the spirit of a landau expansion .",
    "second , the functional derivative of this non - analytic term leads to a singular diffusion equation for @xmath4 and to non - local interactions between grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "the latter effect can be removed by a proper regularization @xcite , but this introduces additional parameters into the model .    here",
    ", we propose an alternative approach .",
    "our model contains only a square gradient term in @xmath4 , but relies on the use of a singular coupling function between orientation and phase field to make the energy cost of angular variations in the solid effectively infinite .",
    "similar ideas were proposed some years ago by lusk @xcite , but were to our best knowledge not pursued any further until now .",
    "the interesting point about this approach is that the equations for the equilibrium grain boundaries and solid - liquid interfaces are ordinary ( non - singular ) differential equations that can be analyzed using standard mathematical tools and concepts from dynamical systems theory .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the dynamical equations for the angle field show the proper behavior , that is , no long - range interactions between grain boundaries arise .",
    "therefore , we believe that this approach can be a useful alternative to existing orientation - field models .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] , we first outline the model ( for isotropic interfaces ) and then show how to determine a suitable coupling function between phase and orientation fields that yields localized grain boundaries . furthermore , we discuss in detail the properties of these grain boundary solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec_anis ] , we then extend the model to include interfacial anisotropy , and present numerical tests both in one and two dimensions to show that the model has the desired properties .",
    "perspectives for future work are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_end ] .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional system in which the crystal orientation can be described by a single angle field @xmath2 ; the local state of the system is described by a phase field @xmath6 .",
    "we start from a free energy of the form @xmath7,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 et @xmath10 are constants .",
    "furthermore , the dimensionless function @xmath11 is a temperature - dependent double - well potential with minima at @xmath0 ( solid ) and @xmath1 ( liquid ) , and @xmath12 is a function that tends to zero for @xmath13 . for simplicity ,",
    "we have neglected crystalline anisotropy for the moment ; its inclusion will be discussed below .",
    "let us first consider a coupling function @xmath14 that takes a finite value @xmath15 in the solid .",
    "the scaling argument which proves that there are no localized grain boundary solutions in this case is as follows . in the absence of anisotropy ,",
    "the grain boundary solution must depend only on the total angle change ( misorientation ) @xmath16 between the two grains . for a solid of size",
    "@xmath17 with a homogeneous continuous orientation variation between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the energy cost ( with respect to a state of constant @xmath4 ) is @xmath20 which decreases monotonously with growing @xmath17 and tends to zero when @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , any localized grain boundary solution has an energy that is independent of the system size ( and includes the energy cost for the variation of the phase field ) . for sufficiently large @xmath17 , the uniform angle variation has therefore always lower energy than a localized grain boundary .",
    "more precisely , whereas grain boundaries can be stable in finite systems depending on the values of @xmath17 and @xmath15 , an isolated grain boundary in an infinite system is always unstable .",
    "this scaling argument also clarifies why a term of the form @xmath22 cures this problem : with such a term , the energy of a homogeneous variation of the angle is independent of the system size and can be made larger than the energy of a localized solution by a proper choice of coupling functions and parameters .    here , we propose an alternative approach to achieve the same goal .",
    "since the above argument holds only for a finite value of @xmath15 , a possible way out is to use a _ singular _ coupling function @xmath14 that tends to infinity when @xmath23 .",
    "the rationale for this idea is that in a crystalline material any continuous variation of the local orientation implies an elastic or plastic strain , which has a high energy cost",
    ". we will show below that we can indeed choose a singular coupling function that leads to grain boundaries with the desired properties .",
    "this function can not be explicitly linked to microscopic physics or an elastic model ; our approach is therefore essentially phenomenological .    for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we use a coupling function of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is some positive real exponent and @xmath26 is a polynomial in @xmath27 which satisfies @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is useful for the following developments to non - dimensionalize the free energy functional and the involved length scales .",
    "the functional has three parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath10 have dimensions of energy per unit length , and @xmath9 sets a free energy ( density ) scale for the ( dimensionless ) double - well potential @xmath11 . dividing the whole functional by @xmath9",

    ", we finally obtain @xmath35 . \\label{general_form_f}\\ ] ] in the following , we consider the case @xmath36 that can be obtained by a proper rescaling of @xmath4 by @xmath37 .",
    "it should be pointed out that this is also the best case for a useful model since then the characteristic thickness of solid - liquid interfaces and grain boundaries are comparable .",
    "the equations of motion for the two fields are obtained by the standard variational procedure @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are relaxation times , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are ( dimensionless ) mobility functions .    for the solidification of a pure substance , the motion of solid - liquid interfaces is linked to heat transport by the stefan condition ( the latent heat released or consumed at moving interfaces must be transported by the local diffusion currents ) .",
    "the model therefore has to be completed by an equation for the temperature field .",
    "we define a dimensionless temperature @xmath43 by @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath17 , and @xmath46 are the melting temperature , the latent heat of fusion , and the specific heat , respectively .",
    "the field @xmath43 obeys the same equation as in the standard phase - field model , @xmath47 with @xmath48 the thermal diffusion coefficient .",
    "it turns out that in order to obtain a model with the desired properties , a certain number of conditions on the exponent @xmath25 , the polynomial @xmath26 and the double - well potential @xmath49 have to be satisfied that are linked in a sometimes subtle way to the internal structure of the grain boundary . in order to facilitate the understanding of the following developments",
    ", it seems useful at this point to state a summary of these results , while the details of the arguments will be given below .",
    "the main points are the following .    1 .   localized grain boundary solutions",
    "which smoothly connect to an infinite bulk solid on both sides can exist only for @xmath50 .",
    "2 .   for a fixed total misorientation @xmath16 and increasing system size @xmath17 ,",
    "the energy cost of a uniformly strained solid tends to zero for @xmath51 and to infinity for @xmath52 . together with condition 1 , this yields that the only reasonable value for @xmath25 is @xmath53 .",
    "the requirement that the angle variation is strongly concentrated in the center of the grain boundary imposes that the first term appearing in the polynomial @xmath26 is of order @xmath54 .",
    "4 .   a uniformly strained solid must be stable against the spontaneous formation of grain boundaries .",
    "this imposes the relation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , and primes denote a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "5 .   for @xmath59 ,",
    "the competition between the gradient terms of the phase field and the orientation field makes it impossible to obtain stable grain boundaries with misorientations smaller than a critical misorientation @xmath60 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath60 is controlled by the same combination of parameters that appears in condition 4 , @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , the last point has implications for the choice of the double - well potential @xmath49 . in the standard phase - field model for solidification",
    ", this potential is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a dimensionless coupling parameter . for this potential , the second derivatives with respect to the phase field , @xmath64 ,",
    "are independent of temperature in both wells ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) ; however , the third derivatives depend on the temperature . for our model",
    ", this would yield a temperature - dependent minimal grain boundary misorientation .",
    "we prefer to use a potential where , in addition to the above properties , the third derivative of @xmath49 in the solid well is kept constant .",
    "furthermore , since for the calculations of the grain boundary energy the solid state is the reference state , we wish to keep the energy of the solid potential well independent of temperature and equal to zero , whereas the height of the liquid potential minimum varies with temperature .",
    "a set of model functions which satisfies all the above requirements and conditions is @xmath65 @xmath66 these functions will be used in the numerical examples given below . in the following",

    "the same argument indicates that changes in undercooling ( increasing undercooling ) should only appreciably modify the high - angle grain boundaries and their energies .",

    "a ) , the minimal grain boundary angle @xmath60 is found to be independent of undercooling . the grain boundary energy for small angles is also almost independent of temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ tdependance ] ( b ) ) . for high - angle grain boundaries ,",
    "the grain boundary energy depends roughly linearly on the undercooling , which is expected since for such boundaries the center of the grain boundary is almost in the liquid state ( @xmath156 ) , and the free energy difference between solid and liquid is proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "we now turn to the case of negative undercooling ( overheated solids ) . whereas it is difficult if not impossible to overheat solids in experiments , due to the fundamental assymetry between solidification and melting ( for a review , see @xcite ) , the existence of grain boundary solutions above the melting point has recently been actively discussed in the context of grain - boundary premelting , due to new results coming from molecular dynamics @xcite and phase - field crystal @xcite simulations .",
    "it has also been examined in orientation - field @xcite and multi - phase - field models @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore useful to analyze our model in the light of this discussion .",
    "a grain boundary can formally be described as two solid - liquid interfaces separated by a thin disordered ( almost liquid ) layer .",
    "the behaviour of a grain boundary when the melting point is approached then depends on whether the grain boundary energy is larger or smaller than the excess free energy of two solid - liquid interfaces . in the former case , the grain boundary is _ repulsive _ , since at the melting point , where the free energy density of both phases is equal , it is advantageous to separate the two solids by a macroscopic liquid layer . in the latter case , the grain boundary is _ attractive _ , since it is favorable for the two solids to stick together .",
    "more quantitatively , the total free energy excess of the grain boundary can be described as twice the solid - liquid surface free energy plus a so - called _ disjoining potential _ , which describes the interaction between the two interfaces as a function of their distance . in the classic theory of grain boundary premelting , this disjoining potential is assumed to be a simple exponential ( see for example @xcite ) , but it was shown that this simple form is not sufficient to describe low - angle grain boundaries in the phase - field crystal model @xcite . indeed , for these boundaries the interaction is attractive for large separations , but repulsive for short ones . as a consequence ,",
    "equilibrium grain boundaries of finite width can exist at and above the melting point .",
    "it was later shown that such behavior ( long - range attraction and short - range repulsion ) is also generic for the standard multi - phase - field models ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .    in our model",
    ", the structure of the solution space can be directly and simply deduced from the effective potential and the relation between the constant @xmath69 and the total angle variation @xmath16 .",
    "let us start out by a brief discussion of the solutions that exist when the angle variation is zero .",
    "in this situation , @xmath100 is zero everywhere , which implies @xmath158 , and the effective potential is just the negative of the double - well potential . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the solid has a lower free energy than the liquid , which implies that the solid maximum in the effective potential is higher than the liquid one .",
    "no turning point exists , and no grain boundary solution of the type outlined above is possible . for @xmath159 , the liquid maximum in @xmath77 is higher than the solid one , and therefore there always exists a turning point .",
    "the corresponding grain boundary solution is unstable .",
    "indeed , it can be seen as a thin layer of liquid sandwiched between two solids , in a situation where the attraction between the two solid - liquid interfaces is exactly balanced by the free energy difference between solid and liquid .",
    "hence , this solution corresponds to a saddle point of the free energy , which can be seen as a one - dimensional liquid nucleus . when the melting point is approached from above , the thickness of the liquid layer diverges , and the grain boundary energy approaches twice the solid - liquid surface tension .",
    "next , consider the situation when @xmath153 .",
    "if the angle variation is finite , the constant @xmath69 differs from zero , and the effective potential has two contributions . since @xmath160 for @xmath161 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ veffdef ] ) diverges in this limit .",
    "in addition , since @xmath12 diverges for @xmath23 , @xmath162 vanishes for @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath163 is positive , there is necessarily at least one solution for the equation @xmath164 , which implies that there is a turning point for any value of @xmath69 .",
    "it remains to link the values of @xmath69 to the total angle variation .",
    "whereas we did not find an analytical expression for this relationship , the main trends can be extracted from an analysis of the trajectory close to the turning point .",
    "when @xmath165 tends to the melting temperature , the constant @xmath69 necessarily becomes small since the liquid maximum in the returned double - well potential lies closely below zero .",
    "this implies that the turning point is very close to the liquid state . as a consequence , @xmath12 is also small , and the orientation gradient becomes large .",
    "since @xmath12 behaves like a power law with exponent larger that one close to the liquid state ( see appendix a ) , the gradient at the center of the boundary becomes larger when @xmath69 becomes smaller .",
    "therefore , arbitrarily large total angle variations can be achieved for any temperature below @xmath45 .",
    "this situation changes when @xmath159 : now , the liquid maximum in the returned double - well potential is higher than zero , which means that a turning point exists even for @xmath158 . when a non - zero value is chosen for @xmath69 , this turning point moves further away from the liquid state .",
    "therefore , the phase field remains finite in the center of the grain boundary , and the orientation gradient in the center of the grain boundary tends to zero when @xmath166 . in this case , the curve of @xmath16 versus @xmath69 is non - monotonous and presents a maximum .",
    "this implies that there is a maximum misorientation beyond which no grain boundary solutions exist .",
    "this maximum misorientation depends on the temperature and tends to infinity when @xmath167 . for misorientations smaller than this critical value ,",
    "there are two distinct solutions .",
    "the solutions for @xmath69 smaller than the maximum correspond to unstable liquid nuclei , whereas the solution branch for @xmath69 larger than the maximum connects to the stable grain boundary solutions discussed previously .",
    "solutions corresponding to a grain boundary and an unstable liquid nucleus are shown on fig .",
    "[ tdependance ] ( d ) .",
    "while the angle profile is extremely similar in both cases , the liquid nucleus solution has a much smaller minimal @xmath27 .",

    "[ tdependance ] ( b ) . at a fixed misorientation above the minimal value",

    "this overheated range tends to zero when the misorientation becomes large .",
    "the stable grain boundary solutions all exhibit a deviation of the phase field from the solid state ( @xmath0 ) , which can be interpreted as a thin layer of liquid by performing a gibbs construction as in ref .",
    "the existence of such a layer of finite thickness results from the interplay between two antagonistic effects , which can be understood through the interpretation of the grain boundary as two solid - liquid interfaces that come close together . on the one hand",
    ", the overlap of the two phase - field `` tails '' of the two interfaces creates an attractive force that would eliminate the liquid layer ( as is happens in the case of zero misorientation ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite total misorientation generates a restoring force that opposes this compression of the liquid layer : if the two interfaces get closer together , the orientation gradients have to increase . on the branch on solutions that is stable , this increase of",
    "the gradient leads to an increase of the free energy of the grain boundary solution , whereas the opposite is true on the unstable branch .    as a result ,",
    "all the grain boundaries in our model are attractive .",
    "this finding coincides with the classic criterion .",
    "indeed , the solid - liquid surface tension can be calculated analytically in our model and is equal to @xmath168 .",

    "obviously , for the sketched geometry this change can not correspond to rigid body rotation .",
    "the evolution equation for the orientation actually describes the _ local _ rotation of disconnected objects , such as the molecules of a liquid crystal . for a continuously connected rigid solid , such a rotation",
    "could only be accomplished by a change in local connectivity , obtained for example by the migration of dislocations from one grain boundary to the other ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . however , since this process ( if it takes place at all ) would be extremely slow , the rotation of the central slab should be suppressed . in the previous orientation - field models that contain a modulus of the gradient in the free energy functional ,",
    "this is problematic since the functional derivative has a singularity at the points with vanishing orientation gradients  that is , inside the grains .",
    "the singular diffusion equation that results from the functional derivative leads to a non - local coupling of the grain boundaries @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the rate of rotation of the central crystal slab does not depend on the distance between the grain boundaries .",
    "therefore , the only solution to suppress the unwanted rotation is to choose a mobility function which vanishes inside the crystal grains @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the interaction between the grain boundaries is local .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated by an analysis of the `` tails '' of the boundary , that is , the approach of the phase and orientation fields to their bulk values .",
    "this is again straightforward by using the mechanical analog .",

    "the gradient in orientation is then obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq_thetaprime ] ) and tends to zero in the grains since @xmath14 diverges as @xmath23 .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from this result .",
    "first , the grain boundaries in our model are truly localized , in the sense that in a heterogeneous system only an exponentially small part of the orientation variation takes place outside the grain boundaries .",
    "second , the interaction between two grain boundaries decays exponentially with their distance for well - separated grain boundaries , since for large separation the interaction is mediated by the overlap of the exponential tails ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) . as a consequence , even for a constant mobility in the orientation evolution equation ( @xmath198 ) ,",
    "the rotation rate of the central slab in the tricristal configuration should rapidly drop with the size of the slab . finally , the characteristic length of decay for the exponential tails @xmath199 is the inverse of the second derivative of the effective potential , taken in the solid state .",
    "as discussed above , the second derivative depends of the value of the constant @xmath69 and vanishes at a critical value of @xmath69 that corresponds to the minimal misorientation @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , grain boundaries with smaller misorientations interact more strongly .",
    "these predictions are borne out by simulations on the tricristal configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_tricristal ] . for grain boundaries of a fixed misorientation",
    ", the rotation rate of the central slab decays exponentially with systems size ( and thus , separation of the grain boundaries ) , and the rotation rate is larger for smaller misorientations at a fixed separation .",
    "therefore , while our model does permit grain rotation , qualitatively by the same mechanism than in previous orientation - field models , the artefacts introduced by this design are small even for a constant mobility function , and it can be hoped that they will not drastically affect the results of large - scale simulations .",
    "our model can describe two different types of boundaries : solid - liquid interfaces and grain boundaries , both of which are in general anisotropic . for solid - liquid interfaces ,",
    "the surface tension and interface mobility depend on the orientation of the interface with respect to the crystal axes of the solid . for grain boundaries ,",
    "the energy and mobility depend on the orientation of _ both _ crystals that meet at the boundary .",
    "this yields two independent parameters in two dimensions , and five independent parameters in three dimensions .",
    "grain boundary energies and mobilities are conventionally given as functions of the _ misorientation _ between the two crystals and the _ inclination _ of the grain boundaries .",
    "the standard way of including the anisotropy of the solid - liquid interfaces in phase - field models is to make the coefficient of the phase - field gradient term dependent on the interface orientation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we will now explore the effects of introducing this type of anisotropy in our model . as we will see below",
    ", the modification of the phase - field gradient term also makes grain boundaries anisotropic .",
    "since the anisotropies in both types of boundaries are created by one single term in the free energy functional , they are obviously not independent . a possible way to choose both anisotropies independently would be to introduce a suitable dependence on orientation in the coefficient of the orientation - field gradient term .",

    "therefore , @xmath4 is actually defined modulo @xmath207 , which means that the values of @xmath4 can be restricted to the interval @xmath208 .",
    "this means that , contrary to what we did in the previous section , we can not rescale @xmath4 to make @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless , we will consider in the following the case @xmath36 for simplicity .",
    "furthermore , care has to be taken in the calculation of differential operators .",

    "however , the system can lower its energy by moving the interface and simultaneously changing the orientation field inside the interface . in this way , a homogeneous liquid",
    "is successively replaced by a solid with a very small `` frozen in '' orientation gradient that results from the time evolution of the surface orientation .",
    "this `` strained '' solid has a higher free energy density than the liquid , but this can be offset by the lowering of the surface free energy , such that the total energy of the system still decreases .",
    "( color online ) the equilibrium shape of an anisotropic crystal ( green circles ) agrees well with the wulff shape ( inner envelope of the red lines ) .",

    ", the presence of the additional degree of freedom ( change in orientation ) leads to a shift of the melting point for anisotropic interfaces . to quantify the importance of this effect",
    ", we have determined the modified melting temperature by performing simulations at constant volume of solid , as described in appendix c. the shift is actually very small , of the order of @xmath228 .",
    "moreover , since the profile of phase field and orientation across the interface are not exactly given by eq .",
    "( [ intsolution ] ) , the actual surface tension slightly differs from the intended value . to test the magnitude of this effect",
    ", we have determined the equilibrium shape of a two - dimensional anisotropic crystal , again by performing simulations at constant volume of solid . in fig .",
    "[ fig_wulff ] , we show the resulting equilibrium shape and the comparison to the wulff construction , which is very satisfactory . indeed , for typical undercoolings that can be reached in simulations ( @xmath229 ) , the shift of the equilibrium point is negligibly small , and therefore it is not surprising that the model is capable of producing an excellent approximation to the equilibrium crystal shape .",
    "we have not explicitly checked young s law at trijunction points for the anisotropic version of our model .",
    "however , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that young s law is generally valid for phase - field models that are variational , since equilibrium states result from an energy minimization . since this is the case for our model , and the equilibrium crystal shape is well reproduced , we are fairly confident that our model also correctly implements the balance of herring torque terms at trijunction points .",
    "we now turn to a more illustrative part , where we show results of numerical simulations for the case of isothermal solidification ( that is , we set @xmath43 to a constant that does not evolve with time ) .",
    "the aim is to show that our model is capable of reproducing the evolution of polycrystals , at least qualitatively .",
    "hence , we have simulated the solidification of an undercooled melt with a few seeds of different crystalline orientations .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_murissement ] .",
    "first , the individual grains grow .",
    "since we do not solve the heat equation ( [ uevolution ] ) , no diffusive instability can appear and create dendrites , and the shape of the grains remains convex .",
    "once the grains impinge , grain boundaries appear .",
    "they evolve toward straight segments , the lengths of which change through the motion of trijunctions while the orientation in each grain remains unchanged .",
    "other situations such as directional solidification in a fixed temperature gradient were also simulated , and also led to qualitatively correct behaviour of the model .",
    "snapshots of the numerical simulation of the isothermal growth of multiple grains .",
    "the grey scale indicates the orientation of grains .",
    "the undercooling is kept homogeneous and constant and the initial grains ( top left ) grow until they begin to interact with each other ( top right ) .",
    "once all the liquid is transformed , the further evolution is only driven by differences in grain boundary energies and becomes much slower .",
    "as one can see , most grain boundaries are already straight ( especially high angle grain boundaries between dark and light regions ) .",
    "a typical change in structure is shown in the two plots at the bottom : snapshots at two successive times of the same region ( only a small part of the system is shown ) are displayed . between the two snapshots , the length of the high angle grain boundary ( between the dark and light region )",
    "has significantly decreased , which has led to a motion from right to left of the triple junction.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have presented a phase - field model for the solidification and coarsening of polycrystals that is formulated in terms of two continuous fields , a phase field that indicates the local state of matter and an orientation field that gives the local direction of the crystallographic axes .",
    "contrary to previous orientation - field models found in the literature , the free - energy functional of our model does not contain a term proportional to the modulus of the orientation gradient , but only a standard square gradient term .",
    "stable localized grain boundary solutions are instead generated by a singular coupling function between the orientation and the phase field .    as a result , the mathematical structure of the model and the evolution equations are closer to the standard phase - field models for solidification , in that the evolution equation for the phase field is a regular reaction - diffusion equation instead of a singular diffusion equation that has to be regularized in a suitable way .",
    "the properties of the grain boundary solutions can be investigated by standard mathematical methods , in particular by the use of the well - known mechanical analog that exploits the relation between interface solutions and the motion of a particle in a potential landscape .",
    "this method has allowed us to perform a thorough analysis of the grain boundary properties , and to choose a suitable mathematical form of the singular coupling function .    one important result of",
    "this analysis is that the grain boundary solutions of our model have a similar structure as the solid - liquid interfaces in standard phase - field models : a central region with strong gradients of both fields is surrounded by exponential tails , and the interaction between two grain boundaries becomes exponentially small with their distance .",
    "two important differences with previous orientation - field models are a consequence of these facts .",
    "first , the artificial grain rotation that is mediated by long - range interactions between grain boundaries is not present in our model .",
    "second , it is possible to incorporate interfacial anisotropy in our model without breaking the variational structure of the model .",
    "the anisotropy generates unphysical `` torque '' terms that drives the orientation fields towards the minima of the surface free energy , but these effects are negligibly small for typical simulation parameters that can be achieved in practice .",
    "we have presented some preliminary simulations performed in two dimensions , which show that a qualitative description of multi - grain growth and of the evolution of polycrystalline solids can be obtained using this model .",
    "it should be stressed that the evolution equation for the orientation obtained from the variational formalism , eq .",
    "( [ theta_evolution ] ) , is likely to be incorrect , as discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that this model can be used for quantitative simulations of grain growth .",
    "nevertheless , in our opinion this model is interesting because of its intrinsic mathematical structure and because of its ability to reproduce a host of complex pattern - formation phenomena with the help of a simple set of equations .",
    "we have concentrated here on the discussion of the mathematical structure of the model , but we have neither tested its efficiency nor its quantitative accuracy in the case of known model problems , such as the growth of an isolated dendrite @xcite .",
    "these are promising subjects for further studies .",
    "the choice of the coupling function for values of the phase field close to one ( the solid ) has already been discussed in the main text . here , we briefly discuss the form of the coupling function @xmath12 close to zero and the double - well potential used in our simulations .",
    "first , @xmath12 must be equal to zero in the liquid ( there should be no energy penalty associated with orientation changes in the liquid phase ) .",
    "furthermore , we must have @xmath230 in order to keep a minimum of the free energy at the liquid state , irrespective of the configuration of the orientation field , which has no meaning inside the liquid .",
    "finally , we also require that the variation of the orientation should remain confined in the grain boundary .",
    "a similar problem was solved in a phase - field model of fracture , where the strain must be localized inside the crack for a broken elastic material . according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , this imposes that @xmath12 should behave as @xmath231 for @xmath161 , with @xmath232 .",
    "choosing @xmath233 would lead to a singular behaviour of @xmath4 in the middle of the grain boundary ( and to strong pinning of the grain boundary on the grid points ) .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath234 .",
    "the conditions on the double - well potential are the following : it should have two minima at @xmath1 and @xmath0 for all temperatures , with a free energy difference proportional to @xmath43 between the two wells .",
    "furthermore , its second and third derivatives in the solid should be constant ; this is guaranteed if its leading order expansion in @xmath0 is of the form @xmath235 ; with this choice , eq .",
    "[ eq_1dhom_ineq_dev ] is satisfied .",
    "in addition , we want to prescribe both the second derivative of the potential @xmath236 and its value @xmath237 in @xmath1 .",
    "the first is set to the same value as the second derivative in the solid well , in order to guarantee a symmetric interface profile of the phase field , and the second is a function of temperature , whereas the depth of the solid well is independent of temperature . assuming that @xmath49 has a polynomial form , the number of equation it has to satisfy is 7 :    1 .",
    "the free energy of the liquid phase is @xmath237 : @xmath238 2 .",
    "the liquid phase is a minimum : @xmath239 3 .",
    "the curvature of the potential at @xmath1 is fixed : @xmath240 4 .",
    "the free energy of the solid state is 0:@xmath241 5 .",
    "@xmath0 is a minimum : @xmath242 6 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath49 in @xmath0 has to be @xmath235 : @xmath243",
    "@xmath244    the first 3 equations impose the value of the constant and of the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath245 in the polynomial expansion of @xmath155 , while the last four equations ( the last three points of the above enumeration ) can be easily translated into a set of four independent linear equations on the coefficient of @xmath49 .",
    "an evident solution is then to consider that @xmath49 is a @xmath246 order polynomial and to solve the linear system imposed by the last four equations in order to compute the remaining coefficients of @xmath49 .",
    "this approach leads to the following expression of v : @xmath247 the remaining 4 coefficients have then to satisfy a set of 4 independent linear equations that can be inverted giving the following polynomial form for @xmath49  :    @xmath248    choosing to have @xmath249 , we have : @xmath250    the choice of @xmath251 ( which yields the correct free energy difference between the two bulk phases ) gives eq .",
    "( [ vfunc ] ) . with this choice of @xmath49 ,",
    "a reasonable choice for @xmath12 is finally : @xmath252",
    "here , we illustrate briefly how a discretization scheme that does not derive from an energy can lead to spurious motion of the interface while a discretization scheme that derives from a free energy can not lead to any such effect .",
    "the free energy we consider ( for simplicity , in one dimension ) writes @xmath253 when simulating the behaviour of a partial differential equation ( pde ) that derives from this free energy , one can either first derive the pde and then discretize it or first discretize the free energy and then derive the evolution equation for the discretized field . in the following ,",
    "we consider both options and show how they differ in the case of the first term in the above functional .",
    "the evolution equation that derives from this term for the phase field @xmath27 is @xmath254 where we have used the chain rule to obtain the second expression . the latter equation is simply discretized as follows : @xmath255 the other approach is to first discretize the free energy : @xmath256 where @xmath257 is either the value of @xmath4 on a staggered grid or the mean value of @xmath4 between the grid points .",
    "this , using the relaxation law @xmath258 , leads to an evolution equation for @xmath259 that writes ( taking into account all the terms of the sum ) : @xmath260 this equation differs from eq .",

    "( [ disc_from_pde_div ] ) . using a taylor expansion centered at the grid point @xmath261",
    "one can show that both discretization schemes are equivalent up to the second order , but differ by terms of higher order .",
    "this just reflects the fact that the chain rule is valid for continuous fields , but not for discrete fields .",
    "these seemingly small differences have important consequences . due to its construction , eq .  ( [ disc_from_energy ] ) implies that @xmath262 is decreasing with time : @xmath263 therefore , the free energy is guaranteed to decrease toward a minimum .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath264-norm of the rate of change of @xmath27 is proportional to the rate of change of the discretized energy .",
    "this means that if the interface is moving , then its squared velocity is proportional to the rate of change of the free energy . in other words ,",
    "any motion of the interface ( whatever are the discretization errors ) comes with a decrease in the free energy .",
    "this differs qualitatively from the expression of eq .",
    "( [ disc_from_pde ] ) which _ a priori _ has no reason to derive exactly from any energy and where the interface can have a motion proportional to discretization errors , as was indeed found in our early investigations of this model @xcite .",
