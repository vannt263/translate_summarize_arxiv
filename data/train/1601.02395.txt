    "nereid is a large , @xmath5350 km sized , irregular satellite orbiting neptune in a very eccentric and inclined orbit @xcite .",
    "although its orbital characteristics are well known , there is still a mistery related to its shape , orientation and rotation rate .",
    "there have been several papers reporting on unusual , in some cases large amplitude brightness variations of nereid on different timescales , from night - to - night variations to changes on annual scales .",
    "these investigations are nicely summarised and discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors preferred solution that could explain the photometric variability was that year - to - year variations are caused by nereid s pole precessing , in some years nereid s pole pointing towards earth while in other years nearly perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "physically this could be explained by forced precession , due to neptune s tidal torque on a non - spherical nereid .",
    "this would require high , 1.9:1 or greater axis ratios .",
    "@xcite attempted to model the rotation of nereid in a way similar to @xcite , but also considering the effect of smaller bodies in addition to the sun and neptune , especially that of triton .",
    "their `` best estimate '' solution is a triaxial ellipsoid with semiaxis ratios of c / a@xmath50.5 , b / a@xmath50.6 , an inital obliquity of @xmath560 and an initial rotation period of 144h .",
    "their model predicts `` active '' and `` inactive '' periods , depending on the actual direction of the main spin axis ( c - axis aspect angles of @xmath590 and @xmath50 , respectively ) , matching the photometry data collected in @xcite qualitatively , however , with some differences in the predicted brightness levels compared with the observed ones .",
    "they explain this latter discrepancy by an additional effect of a non - uniform albedo distribution .",
    "their model predicts a @xmath515-year time between the two extreme orientations .",
    "while the shape of nereid would be essential for the rotation evolution models , this is not known .",
    "@xcite derived a size of 350@xmath050 km from voyager-2 flyby observations in which nereid was resolved to some level , but the quality of the data was not good enough to constrain the shape ( see also * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) .",
    "based on observations in august 2001 and august 2002 @xcite derived a short rotation period of p=1152 for nereid with a small peak - to - peak light curve amplitude of 0029@xmath00.003 .",
    "this rotation period was later questionned by @xcite due to the relatively poor sampling of the rotation curve , and has not been included in the analysis by @xcite either . @xcite obtained a very similar light curve ( @xmath1m=0031@xmath00001 , p=1150@xmath0010 ) based on observations in 2008 , but their light curve was sparsely sampled in terms of rotational phase .",
    "as shown above , ground based observations have not placed a strong constraint on the rotation of nereid .",
    "however , as it has been demonstrated in some recent papers @xcite , data from the extended kepler mission ( k2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be very effectively used to obtain rotational light curves of distant solar system bodies due to uninterrupted photometric time series of several tens of days in length . given that neptune , and therefore nereid as well , was included in the campaign  3 observations of the k2 mission , we attempted to obtain the light curve of nereid from these observations .",
    "in addition to the light curve data , we collected archival spitzer space telescope and herschel space observatory data to detect the thermal emission of nereid in the mid- and far - infrared ( 24160@xmath6 m ) wavelength ranges . in this paper , with the synergy of the light curve information and thermal emission data , we put important constraints on the rotational state , shape , as well as on other physical properties of nereid .",
    "_ kepler _ observed nereid during the third campaign of the extended mission , named k2 @xcite . in this k2 mission , _ kepler _ targets fields near the ecliptic , observing each field for approximately three months .",
    "this quarterly schedule allows the continuous observations of solar system bodies if sufficiently large arcs are allocated in the ccd mosaic of the _ kepler _ space telescope .",
    "main - belt asteroids have a large apparent motion ( comparable to or even larger than the total field - of - view of the space telescope ) .",
    "in addition , main - belt asteroids have a non - negligible noise source on the photometry of stellar targets @xcite .",
    "however , minor bodies outside the main - belt  such as centaurs and trans - neptunian objects  can be observed with a relatively low pixel budget .",
    "in addition , the pixel budget can even be minimized around the stationary point , where masks with a size of @xmath7 pixels can be sufficient to follow trans - neptunian objects up to @xmath8 days @xcite .    in the case of nereid",
    ", a nearly parallelogram - shaped field was allocated for _",
    "kepler_/k2 observations .",
    "this field includes the apparent track of both neptune and nereid and has a size of @xmath9 pixels .",
    "this field is located on _ kepler _ module # 13 and read out by its output amplifier # 2 ( i.e. channel # 42 considering the full mosaic array ) . in order to analyze the field",
    ", we retrieved the @xmath10 individual data frames corresponding to the columns of this parallelogram - shaped ccd area .",
    "thereafter , we built the individual image frames on a rectangular area having a size of @xmath11 .",
    "this area safely covers the parallelogram and includes some additional rows and columns in order to have same extra space for frame registration . in total , the corresponding data series contains @xmath12 individual and useable long - cadence frames .",
    "the total number of frames for campaign 3 were @xmath13 , but @xmath14 frames had to be dropped due to lack of data or inappropriate tracking during the exposure .    due to the lack of a third active reaction wheel , the positioning jitter of _",
    "kepler_/k2 is significantly larger than what it had been during the main mission .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12 frames have to be analyzed independently in order to retrieve the proper astrometric solution as well as to perform an image registration needed by the subsequent steps of differential photometry . to accomplish this astrometry",
    ", we selected nearly a dozen reference stars distributed uniformly in the field . due to the large size of the field",
    ", we did not include additional stamps for this purpose ( see e.g. the case of , * ? ? ?",
    "these stars were used to perform both the differential astrometry ( i.e. the frame registration ) and the absolute astrometry ( i.e. finding the plate solution w.r.t . the j2000 system ) .",
    "the absolute plate solution has been derived by cross - matching the pixel coordinates of the selected reference stars with the usno - b catalogue @xcite .",
    "these @xmath15 stars were also used to transform _",
    "kepler_/k2 photometry to usno - b1 r system .",
    "the usno magnitudes of these star cover the range of @xmath16 , nearly homogeneously . since an unfiltered ccd efficiency curve can be considered as a `` wide r '' band , the comparison of the usno magnitudes with the instrumental ones yielded a fit residual of @xmath17 magnitudes .",
    "therefore , we can state that the accuracy of this transformation is in this range .    in all other aspects ,",
    "the data reduction and photometry were conducted in a similar manner as it was described in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "our photometric pipeline used for _ kepler _ frame reconstruction , source extraction , astrometry and cross - matching , image registration and differential photometry are based on the various tasks of the fitsh package @xcite . the folded light curve ( with the period of @xmath18 ,",

    "[ sect : analysis ] ) of nereid is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "we note here that the formal photometric uncertainities on the individual frames increased from @xmath19 up to @xmath20 throughout this @xmath21days long campaign .",
    "this increment is due to the gradually increasing level of zodiacal light as the elongation of nereid decreased from @xmath22 down to @xmath23 .",
    "this instrumental uncertainity can be compared with the statistical one computed from the root mean square deviation of the photometric data points on each of the @xmath24 bins on the binned light curve .",
    "this latter method gives us an estimation of @xmath25 error for each frame , i.e. slightly larger than the instrumental estimate .",
    "based on previous studies in the literature , the expected amplitude of the light curve variations are relatively small .",
    "therefore , periodicity in the light curve has been searched by assuming a sinusoidal function coadded to a linear function representing the gradual fading of the object ( due to phase angle and distance variations ) .",
    "this function was defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the suspected rotational frequency and @xmath28 is the time after @xmath29 ( chosen in order to minimize the rounding errors and numerical artifacts ) .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 can then be derived using linear regression .",
    "the parameter space in @xmath27 is then scanned in the physically relevant domain with a stepsize comparable to one tenth of the reciprocal timespan of the observations ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",

    "this suggests that the spin axis of nereid remained in approximately the same direction in the last @xmath515years .",
    "however , neptune ( and hence nereid ) moved on its orbit about 30 along the ecliptic in the last 15 years , and therefore the aspect angle @xmath52 of the spin axis should have changed with respect to the observer even if it was otherwise pointing in the same direction in space in this period . the position angle",

    "we looked for solutions that matches the observed spitzer / mips and herschel / pacs far infrared fluxes the best , using the input fluxes listed in table  [ table : fluxes ] . as in the case of the neatm model , we characterise the goodness of fit by calculating the reduced @xmath69 values and we require that acceptable solutions should fulfil the requirement of @xmath83@xmath46@xmath73 .",
    "low ( @xmath78=0.1 ) to intermediate ( @xmath78=0.5 ) surface roughness can not explain the observed fluxes as these values result in very high ( @xmath83@xmath843 ) reduced @xmath69 .",

    "the best - fit case of these models provided an effective size of d=357@xmath013 km and a geometric albedo of p@xmath74=0.24@xmath00.02 .",

    "this favours shape solutions of x@xmath40.13 , and a corresponding subsolar latitude of @xmath65@xmath460 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vartheta ] ) . we have chosen the highest possible shape parameter value of x=0.133 ( a : c=1.3:1 ) and the corresponding subsolar latitude of @xmath65=58 , and tested the feasibility of this configuration in a tpm model . when high roughness ( @xmath78=0.9 ) is assumed we obtained an acceptable @xmath83 value of 1.2 , but this is associated with a very low thermal inertia of @xmath79=0.5@xmath81 .",
    "for this solution the best fit effective diameter is d=335 km , with a correspondig geometric albedo of p@xmath74=0.275 .",
    "application of an extreme roughness of @xmath78=1.0 provides very low reduced @xmath69 values of @xmath50.5 , even when the `` nominal '' @xmath79=5@xmath81thermal inertia values are used .",
    "however , in these cases we obtain a somewhat smaller size of d=326 km and a higher albedo of p@xmath74=0.29 .",
    "the most important question about nereid , as discussed in the literature , was its shape and the precession behaviour of its spin axis .",
    "this was modelled in detail by @xcite and @xcite , with the main aim to explain the large amplitude brightness variations seen on different time scales .",
    "these models assumed a long rotation period ( 72144h ) which was needed to achieve precession timescales of around a decade .",
    "one important finding of our paper is that we confirmed the short ( 11594 ) rotation period observed earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as it has been mentioned previously , a short rotation period implies a long spin axis precession time , as p@xmath88@xmath89p@xmath90/p@xmath91 , where p@xmath88 is the precession period , p@xmath92 is the orbital period around neptune , and p@xmath91 is the rotation period ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "p@xmath88 values calculated from the 11594 rotation period are at least an order of magnitude longer than those assumed by @xcite and @xcite , even if an extremely elongated body is assumed . therefore the spin axis orientation could not change significantly in the last @xmath515 years , and the precession of the spin axis can not be the reason behind the large flux variations observed .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : spin ] we used this stability of the spin axis orientation and obtained a maximum axis ratio of a : c=1.3 from the light curve amplitude analysis . according to @xcite , forced precession of nereid could be feasible only if the moon is considerably elongated with an @xmath2:@xmath3 axis ratio of @xmath51.9:1 .",
    "such a high axis ratio is excluded by our results , consistently with the long precession timescales obtained .",
    "the shape solution favoured by the thermal analysis ( axis ratio parameter of x=0.133 ) is also the one that provides the maximum possible light curve amplitude of @xmath64@xmath4013 , with a peak in the 1960 s ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : spin ] ) .",
    "even this solution is unable to explain the extremely large brightness variations observed some decades ago ( up to @xmath64 of 05 , see fig .  4 in * ?",
    "* for a summary of these data ) .",
    "whatever caused these variations , it can not be the forced precession of a very elongated nereid , as this scenario is inconsistent with our present data .",
    "the long rotation period assumed by @xcite and @xcite was partly based on the expectation that if nereid was formed around neptune or captured at early times , then its original rotation  which could have had a period of a few hours  should have slowed down considerably , even if nereid is just slightly elongated . in this sense",
    ", nereid rotates fast today  this may favour a late capture ( i.e. nereid did not have enough time to slow down considerably ) or indicate some other influence , like a collision , that may overwrite the rotational state .",
    "we note that @xcite suggested that halimede , a small moon of neptune , may be a fragment of nereid broken off during a collision .",
    "this scenario for the origin of halimede is supported by their similar colours and the relatively high probability of a collision between nereid and halimede in the timespan between the formation of the solar system and today @xcite .    as discussed in detail in @xcite ,",
    "the voyager-2 images analysed by @xcite could hardly be used to put constraints on the actual shape of nereid , i.e. we did not have enough information to tell whether nereid was spherical or notably non - spherical .",
    "the combination of the spin axis constrains and both the neatm and tpm radiometry results favors a moderately elongated shape with a axis ratio parameter x@xmath40.13 , and correspondingly a present subsolar latitude of @xmath65@xmath460(a possible shape solution using x=0.133 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tpmres]b ) . the moderately elongated shape put forward here for nereid is feasible regarding observational constraints . however , for a moon of @xmath5350 km in diameter a shape closer to spherical may be more likely ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on the shape information of giant planet moons of similar size .",
    "most of these large ( @xmath58100 km in radius ) moons are round to a few per cent ( better than 10% ) accuracy .",
    "our preferred solution for nereid is further away from a perfect sphere .",
    "one exception among these satellites may be the saturn moon , hyperion , which is highly elongated despite that it is similar in size to nereid ( about 205@xmath93130@xmath93110 km semi - axes ) . in the case of hyperion",
    "the elongated shape is explained by the high porosity of the interior ( @xmath540% ) that also leads to a sponge - like , high roughness surface where craters remain nearly unchanged over billions of years @xcite .",
    "a porous internal structure and high roughness surface similar to that of hyperion may explain well both the elongated shape and the radiometry analysis results obtained for nereid in the present paper .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite presented an analysis of colours and albedos of centaurs and trans - neptunian objects , and identified two main groups whose existence can be considered as an evidence for a compositional discontinuity in the young solar system . for comparison , we plotted the colour and albedo of nereid in a diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : albedocolour ] ) similar to fig .  2 in @xcite , presenting these dark - neutral and bright - red objects .",
    "colours are represented by spectral slopes , calculated in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "if nereid was either formed around neptune or captured during neptun s outward migration from the 20 - 30au distance range in the early solar system , it is expected to exhibit a surface similar to the objects in the dark - neutral group .",
    "indeed , nereid is close in colour to the typical colours of objects in this group , but at the same time , its albedo is significantly larger than the typical value in this group , even larger than the albedos of most objects in the bright - red group .",
    "if nereid was a member to the dark - neutral group , it would have the brightest surface among these objects . while nereid is at the edge of the distributions of objects of both major groups in the albedo - colour plain , it is rather close in these characteristics to the saturnian moon hyperion ( purple triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : albedocolour ] ) . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the surface roughness and internal structure of nereid may as well be similar to those characteristic of this irregular satellite .",
    "in this paper we presented space born observation of nereid , performed by the kepler space telescope in the framework of the extended k2 mission , and results obtained from archival infrared data of the spitzer space telescope and the herschel space observatory . from the kepler k2 data we obtained a light curve that was the same in period and similar in amplitude to those obtained from ground based observations in 2001 and 2008 .",
    "these observations together contrain the possible rotation states of nereid very well . according to these results , nereid is in a low amplitude apparent light curve state nowadays , but may have been in a much larger amplitude state some decades ago .",
    "we managed to exclude very elongated shapes with axis ratios above @xmath94:@xmath95 ; this also means that nereid can not be in a forced precession state due to tidal forces as it is not elongated enough for this process .",
    "this is a robust result as we assumed that the light curve of nereid is solely caused by shape effects and albedo variegations existing on the surfce would just make the moon more spherical in this respect .",
    "we confirmed the size of nereid obtained from voyager-2 flyby data by an independent method ",
    "radiometry based on infrared data .",
    "both the neatm and tpm thermal emission models resulted in similar effective size ( d=335345 km ) and albedo values ( p@xmath74=0.250.27 ) .",
    "both methods indicate very high roughness ( likely @xmath78@xmath40.9 ) independently of shape , i.e. a surface with deep craters and very high surface coverage . using the light curve and thermal emission results together",
    "we obtain a likely moderately elongated shape ( a : c@xmath41.3:1 ) and a present spin axis aspect angle of @xmath52@xmath430 for this irregular moon of neptune .",
    "this shape may partly explain the larger light curves amplitudes observed some decades ago .",
