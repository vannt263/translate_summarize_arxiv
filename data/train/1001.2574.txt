    "attempts to understand relativistic jets of blazars have been greatly advanced by the availability of instruments such as the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , the _ rossi _",
    "x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , and , most recently , the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , together with more traditional telescopes .",
    "long - term multi - waveband monitoring of a number of blazars with these facilities is now providing valuable insights into the physical processes in the jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper presents a rich set of observations of the @xmath1-ray bright quasar pks  1510@xmath0089 ( @xmath5 ) , whose jet exhibits apparent motions of emission features that are among the fastest ( as high as @xmath6 ) of all blazars observed thus far @xcite .",
    "we analyze motions of features in the parsec - scale radio jet alongside variability of the optical polarization and flux from radio through @xmath1-ray frequencies .",
    "the relative timing of correlated variations probes the structure and physics of the innermost jet regions where the flow is accelerated and collimated , and where the emitting electrons are energized .",
    "our observations include imaging with the vlba at 43  ghz in both total and linearly polarized intensity , with angular resolution near 0.10  milliarcseconds ( mas ) , or a projected distance of 0.50  pc ( for @xmath7 km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 and the concordance cosmology ; * ? ? ?",
    "we processed the data and created images in a manner identical to that described by @xcite .",
    "we derived 0.1 - 200  gev @xmath1-ray fluxes by analyzing data from the large area telescope ( lat ) of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope with the standard software @xcite .",
    "photon counts from a circular region of radius @xmath9 centered on pks  1510@xmath0089 were fit by single power - law spectral models of this source , pks  1502 + 106 , and pks  1508@xmath0055 , plus model  v02 of the galactic and extragalactic backgrounds .",
    "the mean slope of the photon spectrum for 2009.0 - 2009.5 for 7-day integrations , @xmath10 , matched that reported by @xcite for 2008.6 - 2008.83 .",
    "our final fluxes are from 1-day integrations using this slope , with a detection criterion that the maximum - likelihood test statistic @xcite exceed 9.0 .",
    "we obtained 2.4 - 10  kev x - ray fluxes with the rxte  pca .",
    "we processed the data as described by @xcite , fitting the photon count spectrum with a single power law plus photoelectric absorption corresponding to a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we measured flux densities at : 14.5  ghz with the 26  m antenna of the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( see * ? ? ? * ) ; 37  ghz with the 14  m telescope of the metshovi radio observatory ( see * ? ? ? * ) ; and frequencies near 230  ghz with the submillimeter array ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we measured the degree of optical linear polarization @xmath13 and its position angle @xmath14 with : the 0.4  m telescope of st .",

    "we also obtained optical ( r - band ) flux densities from photometric observations at the six telescopes listed above , the 2.0  m liverpool telescope , and the 0.7  m meniscus telescope of abastumani astrophysical observatory .",
    "we have added data from yale university .",
    "a number of flares are apparent in the 2008 - 09 radio to @xmath1-ray light curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which includes @xmath1-ray data from agile in 2008 march ; * ? ? ?",
    "of particular interest is the first half of 2009 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , during which eight major @xmath1-ray flares are apparent .",
    "the vlba images ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) feature a bright `` core , '' presumed stationary , from which knots of emission separate at apparent superluminal speeds .",
    "we detect two new knots , with apparent speeds of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the first passed the core on jd  @xmath17 , as the x - ray flux reached a sharp peak , and @xmath18  weeks after a broad maximum in the 14.5  ghz flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the second knot passed the core on jd  @xmath19 , essentially simultaneous with the extremely sharp , high - amplitude optical/@xmath1-ray flare  8 on jd  2454962 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we argue below that this knot was responsible for flares 3 - 8 and possibly 1 - 2 .",
    "flare  8 coincides with the end of a 50-day rotation of @xmath14 by @xmath2 that started near flare  3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this striking phenomenon can be explained either by a stochastic process or by a coherent magnetic field geometry of the flaring region . in the stochastic interpretation",
    ", the magnetic field is turbulent ( see * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the apparent rotation results from a random walk of the resultant polarization vector direction as cells with random magnetic field orientations enter and then exit the emission region . according to our simulations ( described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one rotation by @xmath20 similar to that of pks  1510@xmath0089 and lasting @xmath21 days occurs once per @xmath22  days .",
    "the probability that such a random apparent rotation would coincide so closely with a specific 50-day period of elevated @xmath1-ray flux is extremely small , @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the model predicts equally probable clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of @xmath14 in the same object , while the @xmath24 rotation of @xmath14 between jd  2454990 and 2455000 ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) proceeded at the same counterclockwise rate as during the final stage of the larger rotation .",
    "this implies that the rotation is dictated by geometry , with the accompanying minor flare occurring in the same location as flare  8 .",
    "we observed a similar , but shorter , rotation of the optical polarization in bl lac in 2005 @xcite .",
    "we apply our phenomenological model developed to explain that event to pks  1510@xmath0089 .",
    "a moving emission feature follows a spiral path as it propagates through the toroidal magnetic field of the acceleration and collimation zone of the jet @xcite .",
    "the spiral motion is caused either by rotation of the flow @xcite or a helical stream of electron - positron pairs injected from the black hole s ergosphere @xcite .",
    "the secular increase in the rate of rotation ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) is due to an increasing doppler factor as the flow accelerates until it reaches the core , since the lorentz factor increases as the cross - sectional radius of the jet @xcite .",
    "[ however , the rest - frame angular velocity of the emission feature can not decrease to conserve specific angular momentum as the jet expands @xcite , hence the spiral path followed by the centroid of the feature must maintain a constant radius of helical motion to avoid this . ] the emission feature must cover most of the cross - section of the jet in order to create substantial flares and to cancel most of the polarization ( from different orientations of the toroidal magnetic field across the feature ) while leaving a residual of @xmath25% , with @xmath14 rotating systematically as the feature proceeds down the jet .",
    "front - to - back light - travel time delays also cancel some polarization by stretching the feature along the spiral path as viewed by the observer .",
    "synchrotron flares occur when the energization of electrons increases suddenly over some or all of the emission region ; our model does not attempt to explain these sudden surges in particle acceleration .",
    "the solid curve in the bottom panel of figure [ fig4 ] shows the fit to the variation of @xmath14 of the model , with parameter values that are typical but probably not unique . the bulk",
    "lorentz factor increases linearly with longitudinal distance down the jet from a value of 8 at the onset of the rotation to 24 at the end .",
    "the viewing angle of the jet axis is @xmath26 in the model , so the doppler factor increases from 15 to 38 during this time , and the final apparent speed is @xmath27 , matching the observed value within the uncertainties .",
    "the inflections of the curve are due to changing aberration , which we calculate with the equations of @xcite . the scenario proposed in that paper , in which the jet twists from helical instabilities , can explain the rotation of @xmath14 but not the observed low , randomly changing degree of polarization .",
    "the secular increase both in the rate of rotation of @xmath14 and in optical flux during the first half of the outburst results from the acceleration of the flow and consequent enhanced beaming .",
    "flare  8 , featuring the highest optical flux observed since 1948 @xcite , occurred as the rotation of @xmath14 was ending and the new superluminal knot was passing the core .",
    "this event can be explained by compression of the knot by a standing conical shock @xcite . according to our model , when the knot passed the core it was propagating down the jet at 0.3  pc  day@xmath8 in our frame , and had traveled 17  pc downstream since the rotation of @xmath14 began .",
    "the transverse radius of the jet at this point is @xmath28 cm , based on the opening angle of the jet @xmath29 derived by @xcite .",
    "the propagation rate , plus the 1-day timescale of the flare , sets the longitudinal size of the optical flare region at @xmath30  pc .",
    "we associate this size with the distance moved by an electron radiating at r - band before it loses too much energy to continue doing so . to determine the energy loss rate for all of the events , we first calculate the ratio of @xmath1-ray ( @xmath31  mev ) to synchrotron luminosity ( which equals the ratio of inverse - compton to synchrotron loss rate ) , @xmath32 , of the peak of flares 1 - 8 to be 70 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 30 , 10 , 40 , and 9 , respectively .",
    "we estimate the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation , whose spectral energy distribution peaks at infrared wavelengths , as the r - band flux density multiplied by @xmath33  hz , by 1.27 to correct for extinction @xcite , and then by 6 to convert roughly to bolometric luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we then derive that the magnetic field @xmath34^{2/3}(\\delta/40)^{1/3 } \\sim 0.4\\xi^{-2/3}$ ]  g during flare  8 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 if the seed photons originate from outside the emission feature , @xmath37 for mainly first - order ssc , and @xmath38 for combined first- and second - order ssc .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath390.4  g , with the highest value for the first - order ssc case .",
    "the ( toroidal ) magnetic field at the start of the rotation of @xmath14 was then @xmath40  g.    the 50-day rotation of @xmath14 implies that a single moving emission feature was responsible for the entire outburst encompassing flares 3 - 8 .",
    "we identify this feature as the superluminal knot seen later in the vlba images ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , whose polarization vector lies in the same direction as in the optical shortly after flare  8 .",
    "our observations therefore demonstrate that the high - energy emission from the jet of pks  1510@xmath0089 is quite complex , arising from different regions and probably by multiple emission mechanisms as a _",
    "single disturbance _ propagates down the jet .",
    "both the @xmath1-ray and optical emission is highly variable , but not always in unison .",
    "this is unexpected , since when @xmath391  g , electrons with the same energies , @xmath41 in rest - mass units , should be involved in optical synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering of optical or ir photons to @xmath1-ray energies .",
    "when the emission feature was close to the base of the jet , electrons in the jet could have scattered the broad emission - line region or accretion - disk photons to @xmath1-ray energies as the disturbance first became optically thin to photon - photon pair production ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we speculate that this could correspond to flares 1 - 2 . in this case",
    ", the subsequent quiescent period would imply that there is a section of the jet where neither seed photons nor electrons with @xmath42 are abundant .",
    "we conclude that some or all of @xmath1-ray flares  1 - 4 and 7 , with very weak optical counterparts , were caused by sudden increases in the local seed photon field at optical or ir wavelengths rather than by increased energization of electrons .",
    "the time scales of variability limit the size of each source of seed photons to @xmath43  pc  not much larger than the cross - sectional radius of the jet , @xmath44  pc  while the luminosity of each would need to be @xmath45 pc@xmath46erg s@xmath8 if the source lies at the periphery of the jet , and higher if more remote .",
    "this luminosity is too high for any commonly occurring cosmic object located parsecs from the central engine , but could be obtained in a relatively slow sheath surrounding the ultra - fast spine of the jet responsible for the high superluminal motion @xcite .",
    "moving knots or standing shocks in the sheath could produce the requisite number of seed photons while being too poorly beamed to contribute substantially to the observed flux .",
    "the relatively slow motion and gradual evolution of such features implies that they should persist for years , in which case another series of flares in the near future should exhibit a similar pattern of variability and appearance of a superluminal knot .",
    "flares  5 and 8 included rapid optical flaring that required sudden energization of electrons to @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests that the flaring @xmath1-rays could have been created by the ssc process , an inference that is supported by the lower value of @xmath32 than for the other flares .",
    "this ratio was , however , much greater than unity , which implies that second - order scattering contributed significantly to the @xmath1-ray flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we should therefore expect a different slope of the @xmath1-ray photon spectrum for these flares than for flares  1 - 4 and 7 .",
    "there are a sufficient number of photon counts to measure the slopes for flares  5 , 7 , and 8 : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the probability that these are the same is @xmath51 .",
    "detailed modeling is needed to determine the slopes expected for the different radiation mechanisms .",
    "the extremely high optical flux and polarization of flare  8 imply that the magnetic field was higher and more ordered for this event than for other flares .",
    "this is consistent with our interpretation that the 43  ghz core  where flare 8 occurred  is a standing shock .",
    "the low value of @xmath32 implies that the magnetic field was compressed by a factor @xmath52 over the previous flare .",
    "we suggest that the emission region responsible for flare  5 , when the polarization increased to @xmath53 , was a subset of the entire disturbance , so that there was less cancellation of the polarization .",
    "this indicates that the flare was caused by unusually efficient energization of electrons over only part of the disturbance , although we have insufficient information to determine the cause .",
    "in contrast , flares 6 and 7 occurred when the polarization was quite low , which implies that electrons were accelerated less intensely throughout the entire disturbance .    the flare in 2008 september ( jd  2454700 - 2454750 ; fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is of a different nature than flares  1 - 8 .",
    "it took place one month after a very bright superluminal knot passed through the core ( which coincided with the peak of a major x - ray flare ) , consistent with the finding of @xcite and @xcite that high @xmath1-ray states often follow the time when a new superluminal knot coincides with the core or a millimeter - wave outburst starts .",
    "the frequency - dependent delays  the emission peaked first at optical , then @xmath1-ray ( 10-day lag ) , and then radio and x - ray ( 24-day lag ) frequencies  contrast with the simultaneity of the optical and @xmath1-ray maxima of flares  2 , 5 , 7 , and 8 .",
    "the time delays imply that a power law is maintained over only a limited range of electron energies , with the range changing as a knot separates from the core .",
    "since 1996 , the x - ray emission has correlated better with the 14.5  ghz variations than with those at higher frequencies @xcite . during the 2006 - 2009 period covered by figure  [ fig5 ] ,",
    "the correlation is significant at @xmath54 confidence .",
    "the electrons radiating at 14.5  ghz near the core have energies @xmath55 - 40 in rest mass units , far too small to scatter the 14.5  ghz photons to x - ray energies . for this reason , we conclude , as have @xcite , that these electrons produce the x - rays via inverse compton scattering of ir seed photons from either the sheath of the jet or a source outside the jet , such as a dust torus @xcite . in this case , the x - ray variability is in response to both the evolution of the electron energy distribution  which affects the radio emission in a similar way  and changes in the seed photon density as a knot propagates down the jet . in the observer s frame ,",
    "the radiative energy loss time scale of @xmath56 electrons , @xmath57  s , @xmath58  days when @xmath59  g and @xmath60 .",
    "this is commensurate with the fastest x - ray and radio variability that we have observed .",
    "our comprehensive dataset has revealed some patterns that allow us to probe the locations and causes of the high - energy emission in pks  1510@xmath0089 .",
    "the rotation of the optical polarization vector over 50 days in 2009 , as multiple @xmath1-ray and optical flares took place , implies that a single emission feature  the superluminal knot later seen in our vlba images  was responsible for these variations . as for bl  lac @xcite",
    ", we model this as a structure that followed a spiral path through a helical magnetic field where the jet flow accelerates .",
    "the @xmath1-ray to synchrotron flux ratio varied greatly among the different flares .",
    "this requires local sources of seed photons from both within the jet and just outside , probably in a surrounding sheath . as a consequence ,",
    "flares erupt at a variety of locations as disturbances pass down the jet",
    ". future comprehensive multi - waveband monitoring plus vlba imaging will determine the extent to which our findings apply to the general population of blazars .",
    "funding of this research included nasa grants nnx08aj64 g and nnx08av65 g and nnx08av65 g , nsf grants ast-0907893 and ast-0607523 ( u.  michigan ) , russian rfbr grant  09 - 02 - 0092 , spanish `` ministerio de ciencia e innovacin '' grant aya2007 - 67626-c03 - 03 , the academy of finland , the university of michigan , and georgian national science foundation grant gnsf / st08/4 - 404 .",
