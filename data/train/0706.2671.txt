    "the study of continuum superfluid phase transitions using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods has a history which includes path integral simulations of helium using realistic interatomic potentials , which capture @xmath0 in good quantitative agreement with experiment @xcite , to recent numerical work @xcite focusing on experiments @xcite which observe ` supersolid ' order @xcite , the simultaneous presence of both superfluidity and long range density correlations .    at the same time",
    ", related path integral studies of lattice models ( the ` boson - hubbard ' hamiltonian ) @xcite have been undertaken .",
    "these too have been partially motivated by the issue of supersolid order , but have also been driven by the possibility of studying the universal conductivity in granular superconductors @xcite , and superfluid - mott insulator transitions of relevance to optically trapped atoms @xcite many of these simulations emphasize feynman s picture of the connection between the superfluid transition and the increasing entanglement ( and ultimate development of macroscopic ` winding ' across the whole sample ) of quantum paths as the temperature is lowered . indeed , the superfluid density @xmath1 is proportional to the mean square winding of paths around the lattice@xcite .",
    "however , even before the advent of these large scale qmc simulations which allow the study of the superfluid transition exactly , feynman@xcite and kikuchi@xcite suggested , and studied analytically , an approximate ` classical ' model whose configurations are permutation loops of sites on a @xmath2 lattice .",
    "the partition function they suggested is , @xmath3 \\,\\ , . \\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the effective mass of he atoms , and the function @xmath5 is assumed to be nonvanishing only when the coordinates @xmath6 are located on the sites of a regular lattice ( a cubic lattice in the original treatments ) .",
    "@xmath7 refers to a permutation of the coordinates .",
    "a transition to a ` superfluid ' phase where a macroscopic number of sites participate in a single large loop , as the temperature @xmath8 is lowered , was discovered and investigated .",
    "various approximations were employed to determine the properties of this model , predominantly diagrammatic ( series ) expansions in the exchange loops . to faclitate these analytic treatments , in many of the early studies the allowed permutations",
    "were restricted to  near - neighbor \" exchange in which the maximum  distance traveled \" by each particle @xmath9 , is only one lattice constant @xmath10 .",
    "that is , @xmath11 for all particles @xmath9 .",
    "one of the early issues concerned whether the superfluid transition was third order , as originally found by feynman @xcite , or second order @xcite and whether the order was affected by the restriction to near - neighbor exchange .",
    "another issue was the behavior of the specific heat , both how to eliminate various artificial structures ( and even negative values ) near the phase transition , and also how to recover the experimentally observed @xmath12 behavior in superfluids at low temperatures . here",
    "the removal of the restriction to local permutations was found to be crucial @xcite .",
    "the feynman - kikuchi ( fk ) model is closely related to the duality - transformed @xmath13 model @xcite , where the partition function can also be expressed in terms of sums of closed paths on a lattice .",
    "the allowed configurations are somewhat different , since in the @xmath13 case path overlap is allowed whereas in the fk model , each @xmath6 appears only once in @xmath14 .",
    "however , the energy for paths grows quadratically with the overlap , so that in practice large overlaps are unlikely , enhancing the similarities between the partition functions .",
    "this connection is perhaps not so surprising since both models offer ways to understand the superfluid phase transition .    in this paper",
    "we will study the fk model in @xmath15 using monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent work on supersolids , we will then suggest a generalization which contains ` vacancies ' and interactions between the occupied sites .",
    "we will determine the nature of the superfluid phase transition , and how it depends on particle density , and also study the possibility of charge ordered states arising from the interactions .",
    "the results allow up to construct the phase diagram of our generalized fk model .",
    "we begin by briefly reviewing the motivation for the fk model which will expose the connection with exact path integral expressions for the partition function .",
    "consider the quantum hamiltonian for a system of @xmath16 interacting bosons , @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the momentum and position operators .",
    "the partition function is given by , @xmath20 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & { \\rm tr } \\ , \\big [ e^{-\\epsilon \\hat k / t } \\ , e^{-\\epsilon \\hat v / t } \\cdots \\ , e^{-\\epsilon \\hat k / t } \\ ,",
    "e^{-\\epsilon \\hat v / t } \\ , \\big ] \\ ] ] where , following the usual the path integral approach @xcite , a small parameter @xmath21 has introduced , the exponential of the full hamiltonian has been broken into @xmath22 pieces with @xmath23 , and then approximated by the product of the exponentials of the kinetic and potential energies individually .",
    "this ` trotter ' approximation@xcite becomes exact in the limit @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have set boltzmann s constant @xmath26 for simplicity .",
    "the trace is evaluated by summing over a complete set of position eigenstates , and also inserting additional complete sets of position eigenstates throughout the string of incremental imaginary time evolution operators .",
    "the potential energy exponentials act on the eigenstates to give numbers , and the remaining matrix elements of the kinetic energy operators are readily computed , yielding , @xmath27 ^ 2 \\,\\ , . \\ ] ] here the superscript @xmath28 is an ` imaginary time ' index which labels the point of insertion of the different complete sets of states .",
    "the final set of positions @xmath29 is constrained to be a permutation @xmath7 of the original positions @xmath30 , as a consequence of the trace in the definition of the quantum partition function .",
    "the sum over permutations @xmath7 incorporates the indistiguishability of the bosonic particles .",
    "this completes the representation of the partition function as an integral over classical paths in space and imaginary time .",
    "examination of this _ exact _ expression for the partition function , now readily motivates the origin of the fk model .",
    "the function @xmath5 , and its restriction to a cubic lattice , can be thought of as arising from the potential energy terms which act to tend to localize the particle positions in a regular array .",
    "the _ single _ exponential in the particle positions in the fk model can be regarded as a truncation of the complete set of @xmath22 exponentials for all imaginary times .",
    "notice that the combination of the leading factor @xmath31 and the two such factors in the denominator of the ` kinetic energy ' lead to the appearance of the temperature in the _",
    "numerator_. from the viewpoint of the original path integral , this reflects the fact that as the temperature is lowered , the paths have more ( imaginary ) time in which to propagate , and it becomes increasingly easy for them to permute .",
    "physically , this then leads to a superfluid phase transition as @xmath8 is lowered .    in this paper",
    ", we will work with the fk model on a two dimensional square lattice .",
    "we will denote by @xmath32 the inverse of the prefactor of the sum of the distances traveled by the individual particles .",
    "that is , our partition function will be , @xmath33   = \\sum_{{\\cal p } } { \\rm exp } \\ , \\big[- { 1 \\over \\beta } \\sum_i ( { \\bf r}_i - { \\cal p } { \\bf r}_i ) ^2 \\big ]   \\ ] ] to be explicit , to a labeling of the sites of the two dimensional square lattice , illustrated in fig .  1 ( left ) we associate a permutation @xmath7 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .  1 ( right ) .",
    "this configuration contains three nontrivial permutation loops : the particles at sites 8 and 9 are in a ` two particle ' loop , as are the particles at sites 5 and 18 .",
    "note that in the former each particle moves a single lattice site , and contributes ` 1 ' to the energy , while the square of the distances traveled by each particle in the latter case is 5 .",
    "the fourth and fifth rows contain a loop of five particles ( moving distances @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) which extends ( ` winds ' ) all the way across the lattice in the @xmath36 direction . the remaining sites , which share the same labels in the left and right , correspond physically to particles which have not undergone an exchange .",
    "the total energy @xmath37 of the three loops in this configuration @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions produce an ambiguity in the definition of the energy , since there is more than one way in which to compute the distance traveled by each particle .",
    "we define the energy by choosing the smallest of such distances .    in order to monitor the superfluid phase transition we measure the winding across the lattice in the @xmath36 and @xmath40 directions .",
    "@xmath41 counts the difference between the number of particles which move to the right across the vertical edge of the lattice and those which move to the left .",
    "an analogous definition applies for @xmath42 across the top , horizontal edge .",
    "we define @xmath43 . in the right panel of fig .  1 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we now introduce our extension of the fk model to allow for vacancies . in so doing ,",
    "we are motivated by recent work on ` supersolid ' phases @xcite which are , in fact , continuations of an extensive history . in the configuration in the right panel of fig .  1 ,",
    "each site is labeled by one of the 36 sites in the left panel .",
    "all sites are occupied .",
    "we can define a set of ` vacancies ' by assigning ` 0 ' to a subset of the sites in the lattice ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) .",
    "an allowed configuration @xmath46 of the system has zeroes at the same sites as the vacant sites in @xmath6 and the occupied site labels are permuted .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "2 ( right ) . by a similar calculation to",
    "that described for fig .  1 , the configuration shown has energy @xmath47 .",
    "note that we will consider `` annealed '' vacancies : the vacancy density is fixed , but the system is allowed to sample all possible density locations satisfying that global constraint .    once vacancies are allowed , it is possible to introduce additional terms in the summand of the partition function which control their relative positions on the lattice . we choose to add the simplest possible term , @xmath48 the sum is over neighboring sites @xmath49 of the lattice .",
    "@xmath50 adds @xmath51 to the energy for each link which connects sites both of which are occupied . as emphasized in eq .  6",
    ", this number is the same whether the permuted or unpermuted sites are used in the summand , since the collection of occupied sites before and after the exchanges is the same .",
    "the resulting partition function combines the original fk exchange term and the new interaction term , @xmath52 \\,\\ , . \\ ] ] the inverse temperature @xmath32 appears in the interaction term in its usual place .",
    "we conclude this section by briefly discussing our simulation algorithm .",
    "our approach is a straightforward implementation of the metropolis monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "we suggest a change in our permutation which consists of interchanging two , randomly selected , entries @xmath14 and @xmath53 in the permutation @xmath7 .",
    "if a vacancy is moved , the list of occupied sites and their permutation must be changed accordingly .",
    "the resulting change @xmath54 in the argument of the exponential appearing in the partition function is evaluated , and the change is accepted with probability @xmath55 .    as with most path integral simulations , such local moves have difficulty evolving the configuration through phase space at large @xmath32 where the important paths are dominated by large loops .",
    "we therefore also introduce ` global ' moves which shift the elements @xmath14 by one lattice constant for sites @xmath9 across an entire column or row of the lattice .",
    "such moves change the vertical or horizontal winding of the lattice by @xmath56 . in some simulations",
    "such moves have low acceptance rates as the system size increases .",
    "indeed , this is a primary limitation of simulations of real helium @xcite .",
    "however , we do not encounter this difficulty here .",
    "we begin by studying the original fk model . in fig .",
    "3 we show data for the mean square winding @xmath57 as a function of @xmath32 for different lattice sizes . we see that the winding becomes nonzero as @xmath32 increases , and that the onset of nonzero winding becomes increasingly sharp as the lattice size grows .",
    "this raw data is suggestive of a critical @xmath58 for the development of macroscopic loops . in simulations of the fk model in which only local exchanges are allowed , on a @xmath2 cubic lattice @xcite , elser finds @xmath59 .",
    "presumably the higher dimensionality lowers @xmath60 relative to our @xmath15 square lattice while the restriction to local exchage would tend to raise @xmath60 .",
    "hence a rough match of the critical points is plausible .",
    "we can make the case for a phase transition , and determine @xmath60 with higher precision , by scaling our raw data .",
    "we adopt the usual ansatz @xcite which postulates that the dependence of the order parameter on the parameter controlling the transition and on the lattice size takes the scaling form , @xmath61 \\,\\ , . \\ ] ] here @xmath62 is a universal ( lattice size independent ) function of its argument , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are critical exponents .",
    "this scaling form is usefully rewritten as , @xmath65 \\,\\ , . \\ ] ] from this expression it is clear that if we scale the order parameter @xmath57 by the lattice size to an appropriate exponent , @xmath66 , and plot as a function of the control parameter @xmath32 , all the curves will cross at the universal value @xmath67 when @xmath68 , regardless of the value of the second exponent @xmath64 .",
    "4 presents the results of the analysis in which the vertical ( order parameter , @xmath57 ) axis alone is scaled .",
    "we observe a universal crossing of the five curves , and infer @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we calculate the average energy and specific heat from the partition function using the standard thermodynamics formulae , @xmath71 fig .",
    "[ cx ] shows a plot of specific heat as a function of temperature .",
    "we used the temperature rather than @xmath32 as our horizontal axis , as is more conventional .",
    "we see that there is a peak in the specific heat at roughly the same position as the crossing of the winding @xmath72 .",
    "plot of specific heat for the original fk model , that is , a fully filled lattice with no vacancies and no interactions . the value of the critical temperature inferred from the scaling of the winding ( fig .",
    "4 ) is indicated as a vertical dotted line .",
    "the negative values of @xmath73 at low @xmath8 are a finite size artifact , as explained in the text . ]",
    "the specific heat exhibits a sharp drop , and goes negative , close to @xmath74 .",
    "this is a non - physical effect which appears due to the finite size of the lattice , as can be seen as follows .",
    "starting with the partition function of eq .",
    "5 we obtain , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the partition function used in monte carlo simulations ; @xmath77 is our mc calculation of energy .",
    "the specific heat @xmath78 for a finite lattice , as @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 approach constant values given by all permutations on the @xmath82 lattice having equal probability . as a consequence , as @xmath79 , @xmath83",
    "so at large @xmath32 , or small @xmath8 , the specific heat becomes negative , achieves its minimum , and goes back to zero , as @xmath84 .",
    "as the lattice size increases , the area of negative specific heat moves closer to @xmath74 .",
    "this is because the situation when all permutations have approximately equal probability occurs when @xmath85 , or @xmath86 , so @xmath87 , or @xmath88 for this area of negative specific heat .    despite the crudity of the model ,",
    "we can , following feynman and kikuchi@xcite , use these results to infer a rough critical temperature for helium , the scaling of the winding gives @xmath89 , or @xmath90 . to recover physical values for the temperature we note our unit is @xmath91 , where @xmath28 is the mass of boson , and @xmath10 is lattice spacing . for @xmath92he , using density of 146 @xmath93 , and @xmath94",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 .",
    "this puts our transition temperature around 1.5 k , which is in the same ballpark as @xmath0 for helium .",
    "we close this section by examining the low @xmath8 behavior of the specific heat , since obtaining the proper exponent was the focus of much of the original work on the fk model . in three dimensions , where the initial analytic studies were performed , a linearly dispersing ( phonon ) mode @xmath96 gives @xmath97 at low @xmath8 . here",
    "we are working in @xmath15 , where instead @xmath98 .",
    "[ cxxlog ] shows an attempt to fit @xmath73 to a power law .",
    "the least squares fit gives @xmath99 for lattices of different sizes , which is in reasonable agreement with the prediction based on a linearly dispersing mode .",
    "( we restrict our fit to temperatures higher than those at which the finite size artifact negative @xmath73 values onset . )     a log - log plot of specific heat versus temperature yields data consistent with a straight line of slope @xmath100 , in agreement with the expected value , 2 .",
    "we used a temperature range @xmath101 , where @xmath8 is small , but out of range of the ( non - physical ) dip in @xmath102 , ]",
    "we now turn to our generalization of the fk model in which we allow a lattice with partial filling and a repulsive interaction @xmath51 between nearest neighbor sites .",

    "is whether @xmath50 induces vacancy / density ordering .",
    "we define the real space density correlation function , @xmath110 where the density @xmath111 if the site @xmath9 is occupied and is zero otherwise . the structure function , @xmath112 is the fourier transform of the density correlations . here",

    ", @xmath118 will go to a constant as the system size increases , for the appropriate ordering wave vector @xmath119 .    proceeding in analogy with the winding @xmath120",
    ", we measure @xmath121 for different lattice sizes and do finite size scaling to determine @xmath106 for the cdw transition .",
    "representative plots , for @xmath122 , are shown in figs .",
    "[ dd ] and [ ds ] .",
    "putting together such sweeps for different interaction strengths @xmath51 yields the density order - disorder ( cdw ) phase boundary in the @xmath123 plane at half - filling shown in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "in fact , a number of aspects of the phase diagram of fig .  [ phases ] can be inferred by a mapping to the ising model .",
    "we note that the interaction energy @xmath50 of eq .",
    "6 maps precisely to that of the ising model ( the well - known equivalence of lattice - gas and ising models ) with the definition of the spin @xmath124 .",
    "the alternating occupied and empty site pattern caused by the repulsive particle - particle interaction ( @xmath125 ) corresponds to an antiferromagnetic arrangement in spin language .",
    "the quantity @xmath126 plays the role of the exchange constant @xmath127 .",
    "the critical temperature of the ising model given by the onsager solution @xmath128 then implies a density ordering @xmath129 .",
    "we expect this result to be accurate for @xmath130 where @xmath50 dominates over any effects on the site densities which might be caused by the exchange term .",
    "this curve is shown as the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "we can also make a qualitative argument for how the phase boundary might bend away from this ising limit as the role of @xmath32 becomes larger .",
    "for any given density arrangement , the exchange of particles provides additional configurations of the system associated with permutations of the particle indices .",
    "such configurations have lower energy when the occupied sites are adjacent .",
    "thus we expect that the exchange term will favor `` ferromagnetic '' spin configurations , in competition with the `` antiferromagnetism '' driven by @xmath50 .",
    "this suggests a lowering of the cdw transition temperature .",
    "just such an increase in @xmath131 is seen in the phase diagram .",
    "one may well ask whether there is an extreme limit where the attraction between particles due to the greater ease of exchange becomes so dominant that phase separation occurs ( ferromagnetic clusters in spin language ) . we will address this possibililty later .",
    "the corresponding effect of @xmath51 on the superfluid phase transition is less easy to describe rigorously , in part because we do not begin from a known limit like the onsager solution in the density transition case . on the one hand , increasing @xmath51 drives the particles apart , making local exchange more expensive , suggesting that @xmath104 might increase . on the other hand ,",
    "the superfluid transition is not caused by local exchange but instead by global winding , and by separating the particles , @xmath51 might help provide regularly spaced `` stepping stones , '' aiding global winding and decreasing @xmath104 . while these qualitative arguments provide different conclusions , numerically , the answer is clear from fig .",
    "[ phases ] : turning on @xmath51 decreases @xmath104 .",
    "the effect is not large , however .    in the limit of large @xmath51 and half - filling , a perfect cdw phase forms , which corresponds to a completely filled square lattice with a lattice constant @xmath132 larger than the original lattice ( and rotated by 45 degrees ) .",
    "the squared distances in the fk exchange energy will be scaled up by a factor of two , and hence @xmath104 will be twice the value for the no - vacancy fk model of the previous section . thus @xmath133 .",
    "this value is shown as the circle at @xmath122 in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .    in order to develop a simple understanding of @xmath104 for general @xmath51",
    ", we consider a small ( four site , two particle ) cluster and enumerate completely the allowed configurations .",
    "there are six possible density configurations , which separate into two classes .",
    "four of them have the two particles adjacent , while the other two have the two particles separated by vacancies :    @xmath134    we have included the degeneracy factors in the weight . for each density configuration",
    ", there are two permutations .",
    "since we are interested in the superfluid transition , we will restrict ourselves to the case where the two particles do exchange , which is reflected in the nonzero value of the kinetic energy in the table above .",

    "we consider general filling @xmath144 .",
    "specifically , in fig .  [ phases2 ] we exhibit the phase diagram in the @xmath145 plane for two fixed values of the interaction , @xmath146 and @xmath147 . fig .  [ phases2 ] was obtained using the same analysis as in the earlier sections : evaluation and scaling of the winding and structure factor as a function of @xmath32 for different @xmath51 and @xmath144 .",
    "several features are immediately apparent from the phase diagram : charge ordering is , as expected , favored close to half - filling , with the highest transition temperature at @xmath148 .",
    "interestingly , the shape and size of the density ordered region around half - filling is in rough agreement with the boundaries obtained for checkerboard solid order in the extended boson - hubbard model @xcite where similar superfluid and charge ordered phases are present in an explicitly quantum model .    in the preceding section we argued that @xmath149 for half - filling and @xmath150 should be a factor of two larger than for the original , no vacancy fk model , and showed this",
    "was borne out numerically .",
    "one might expect that a similar result would be true for general fillings and that @xmath149 would be increased by a factor of @xmath151 , since this factor reflects the increase in the square of the average interparticle spacing .",
    "@xmath152 however , on further consideration , it is not quite so .",
    "half - filling and @xmath150 is a special case and in general the particles are not dispersed uniformly , that is , they no longer all have the same distance from their nearest neighbors .",
    "nevertheless , this relation provides a reasonable guide to the density dependence of the superfluid transition , and is shown on phase diagram at fig .",
    "[ phases2 ] as the line  @xmath153 \" . in fig .",
    "[ phases2 ] we also see that as @xmath32 is increased at @xmath148 and fixed @xmath146 , we go from normal to superfluid to supersolid , where the phases are labeled by the behavior of the two order parameters , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "likewise at larger @xmath147 we go from normal to cdw to supersolid .",
    "while the order parameters provide unambiguous identification of the phases , it is also interesting to see if the thermodynamics can pick up the two successive transitions in the form of separate peaks in the specific heat . to study @xmath73",
    ", we proceed similarly to the derivation for the partition function with only the kinetic energy term .",
    "now our partition function has both potential and kinetic energy . @xmath154    fig .",

    "as can be seen , we can not resolve separate peaks in @xmath73 associated with these transitions .",
    "it is likely that the critical temperatures are too close and that the finite size rounding blurs the two peaks into a single maximum .",
    "we can however exhibit separate sf and cdw peaks in the specific heat if we push the transitions apart sufficiently .",
    "for example , at @xmath161 the cdw transition occurs at a much higher temperature than the sf transition . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ cxv10 ] we can now observe separate signatures of the two transitions in @xmath73 . the maxima occur close to the transition points given by the order parameters .",
    "our final results concern the possibility of phase separation .",
    "one might argue that in a model with vacancies , especially at low or vanishing @xmath51 , the particles will clump together in order to facilitate exchange .",
    "indeed , phase separation has been observed in a related model : the bose hubbard hamiltonian with ring exchange , precisely due to this mechanism @xcite .",
    "phase separation is signalled by a peak in the density structure factor at small momenta @xmath119 ( as opposed to the cdw ordering vector at the largest @xmath113 ) .",
    "crudely speaking there are real space density fluctuations at long wavelengths , corresponding to a lattice with one side half occupied and the other half empty .",
    "these translate into a peak in @xmath116 at small @xmath119 . note that in a canonical ensemble simulation such as is performed here",
    "we can not set @xmath162 since that value of the structure factor is just a constant set by the filling .",
    "indeed with our definition of the density correlations in terms of fluctuations about the average density per site , eq .  14 , @xmath163 .    for a perfectly phase separated state with all particles on the right - most half of the lattice we find @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "[ ps- ] we see that @xmath166 is @xmath167 of that figure for @xmath125 .",
    "we conclude there is no phase separation in this model .",
    "the absence of a signal for phase separation is in contrast to the behavior in the related bose - hubbard model with ring exchange @xcite there the same quantity , the average of the structure factors at the three lowest momenta shows a sharp rise with increased exchange , as one enters the superfluid phase .",
    "in this paper we have presented monte carlo simulations of the phase diagram of an extension of the @xmath15 feynman - kikuchi model which includes vacancies .",
    "we found phases which have density and superfluid order , and where these two types of order coexist . unlike the boson - hubbard model where supersolid order requires doping away from half - filling in the extended fk model @xmath1 is nonzero even in the defect - free checkerboard solid",
    "the reason is that the boson - hubbard kinetic energy moves particles only between near - neighbor sites .",
    "bosons can not exchange without passing through an energetically unfavorable region .",
    "but in the fk model , exchange at longer range can occur without ever ` passing through ' the rare configurations with near - neighbor sites that are occupied .",
    "one might expect that in the fk model which is restricted to local exchange , the half - filled supersolid might be eliminated .    a further problem of interest in the extended fk is to consider `` quenched '' vacancies in which the locations of the empty sites are frozen throughout the simulation . here",
    "again we might expect that when a restriction to local exchange is enforced , there could be a destruction of the superfluid transition as the percolation threshold is crossed . in the model allowing exchanges of arbitrary distance , one expects a more trivial increase in @xmath60 , but that the superfluid transition would likely persist",
    ".    a final avenue for exploration would be the inclusion of a one - body vacancy potential which could be chosen to confine the particles preferentially towards the center of the lattice .",
    "such simulations would connect with recent experiments on cold atoms in magnetic and laser traps .",
