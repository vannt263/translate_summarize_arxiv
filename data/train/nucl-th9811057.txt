    "<S> we demonstrate , for the first time , successful s - matrix to potential inversion for spin one projectiles with non - diagonal @xmath0 yielding a @xmath1 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the method is a generalization of the iterative - perturbative , ip , method . </S>",
    "<S> we present a test case indicating the degree of uniqueness of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the method is adapted , using established procedures , into direct observable to potential inversion , fitting @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 for d + alpha scattering over a range of energies near 10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 interaction which we find is very different from that proposed elsewhere , both real and imaginary parts being very different for odd and even parity channels .    the inverse scattering problem , i.e.  the problem of determining a potential from the scattering matrix , has not until now been solved for the scattering of spin one projectiles . </S>",
    "<S> spin one inversion is substantially different from that for spin zero or spin half because , even for a spin - zero target , the elastic scattering ` @xmath7-matrix ' is no longer a complex number but a matrix . </S>",
    "<S> when spin-1 projectiles scatter from a spin - zero target , the conserved quantities are total angular momentum @xmath8 and parity @xmath9 . when @xmath10 , two values of orbital angular momentum , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are , in general , coupled by a tensor interaction . </S>",
    "<S> calculating the @xmath7-matrix @xmath0 therefore requires a coupled channel calculation and inversion from @xmath0 to a potential containing a tensor term requires a coupled channel inversion . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate a spin - one inverse scattering procedure . it is incorporated into a direct data - to - potential inversion procedure which is used to analyse @xmath13h  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14he scattering data at around 10 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a substantial parity dependent tensor interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> coupled channel inversion is here carried out using a generalization of the iterative perturbative ( ip ) inversion procedure@xcite , which is successful for @xmath15 inversion for spin half projectiles . </S>",
    "<S> features of the ip method ( e.g.  the ability to handle a range of energies simultaneously and to include majorana terms for all potential components ) all apply .    </S>",
    "<S> we seek a potential with many components , each component being labelled with index @xmath16 identifying central , spin - orbit or tensor terms , each real or imaginary . </S>",
    "<S> the number of components further doubles where , as essential for light nuclei , parity dependence is permitted . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the tensor force is of the form @xmath17 @xcite , where @xmath18 is assumed to have both wigner and majorana terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the ip method commences from a ` starting reference potential ' , srp and the potential is corrected iteratively . at each iteration , all components , indexed by @xmath16 , are modified by adding a superposition @xmath19 where functions @xmath20 are members of an ` inversion basis ' ( which , if required , can be chosen differently for different @xmath16 . ) the amplitudes @xmath21 are determined at each iteration from linear equations , based on an svd algorithm , which successively reduce @xmath22 . for each partial wave @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath24 is the ` target ' @xmath7-matrix and @xmath25 is for the potential at the current iteration . here </S>",
    "<S> label @xmath23 is a single index which identifies non - diagonal elements of @xmath0 as well as the energy @xmath26 when @xmath27 for energies @xmath26 are simultaneously inverted . </S>",
    "<S> the physical basis of the equations leading to @xmath28 is the the linear response of @xmath29 to small perturbations in the potential@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result applies to the non - diagonal as well as diagonal terms . for </S>",
    "<S> any given set of conserved quantum numbers , certain channels will be coupled by the nucleus - nucleus interaction and we use labels @xmath30 for these channels . </S>",
    "<S> thus the matrix element of the nucleus - nucleus interaction @xmath31 between the wavefunctions for channels @xmath32 and @xmath33 , corresponding to integrating over all coordinates but @xmath34 , will be written @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the increment @xmath36 in the non - diagonal s - matrix which is due to a small perturbation @xmath37 , is@xmath38 where @xmath39 is the @xmath40th channel ( first index ) component of that coupled channel solution for the unperturbed non - diagonal potential for which there is in - going flux in channel @xmath32 ( second index ) only . </S>",
    "<S> the normalisation is @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are incoming and outgoing coulomb wavefunctions for orbital angular momentum @xmath11 ; there is no complex conjugation in the integral . </S>",
    "<S> starting from eq.[integ ] , spin - one inversion becomes a straightforward generalisation of the procedure described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and is now implemented in the code imago  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * testing spin-1 @xmath44 inversion . </S>",
    "<S> * we established that in forward ( rather than inverse ) mode , a given @xmath1 potential led to the same @xmath0 and observables ( including tensor analysing powers ) as the standard deuteron scattering code ddtp  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a convenient property of the ip inversion method is the fact that when a sequence of iterations converges to small @xmath45 , as defined above , we can be sure that we have found a potential which reproduces the set of target @xmath0 to a precision which corresponds to that value of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the forward - mode test verifies that we have found a correctly defined potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also tested the prescription for spin-1 @xmath44 inversion using a known potential to define the target @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> one set of results , for 20.2 mev deuterons scattering from @xmath14he is shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> the target potential  @xcite ( solid line ) has a complex central term and real @xmath46 and @xmath18 terms but no majorana components . </S>",
    "<S> this potential reproduces the tensor analysing powers but with a @xmath1 interaction much stronger than folding models  @xcite predict . </S>",
    "<S> the two inversion solutions shown in fig .  1 both arise from a starting potential ( srp ) with only one non - zero component , a real central woods - saxon potential 60 mev deep . </S>",
    "<S> although few partial waves contribute significantly to the inversion , only 3 - 4 iterations were necessary to give solution a ( dotted ) and solution b ( dot - dashed ) , which reproduced all four volume integrals to better than 1 % , required not many more.defects in the tensor and spin - orbit terms for @xmath47 reflect the fact that both @xmath46 and @xmath48 have zero diagonal matrix elements for @xmath49 . a test case involving </S>",
    "<S> parity dependence would necessitate a smaller inversion basis , and hence reproduce each component with less accuracy , since @xmath0 for the same range of @xmath8 must determine twice as many components ; this is relevant to the case described below .    </S>",
    "<S> * direct data - to - potential inversion . </S>",
    "<S> * the preferred method of applying inversion methods to experimental scattering data is to convolute the phase shift fitting with the @xmath44 inversion to form a direct data - to - potential inversion procedure . </S>",
    "<S> this can be coded in a single data fitting program . </S>",
    "<S> the two step procedure in which one first fits the data with @xmath0 and then subsequently inverts @xmath0 does not guarantee that the @xmath0 for different energies are smoothly related like @xmath0 derived from a single potential . the direct inversion formalism has been described and applied  @xcite to cases where there is no channel coupling and it carries over to the present case with no change in basic principle . </S>",
    "<S> it has been implemented in code imago  @xcite and the convolution was thoroughly tested through explicit checking of all the derivative terms which are required  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * application to deuteron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> * we have analysed the scattering of tensor polarised deuterons from @xmath14he over a series of energies near 10 mev using direct data - to - potential inversion . </S>",
    "<S> this case is of particular interest both because it should become feasible to do quite realistic calculations using rgm or similar methods and also because the deuteron is the archetypal easily polarisable halo nucleus . from the data set for d  alpha scattering tabulated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have selected data of jenny _ et al_@xcite which is of high quality and covers a wide angular range . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the following observables , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for the energies , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this range includes broad 2@xmath50 resonances and a region of strong mixing between the 1@xmath50 channels . </S>",
    "<S> ref  @xcite applies direct data - to - potential ip inversion to data from the same source but without fitting @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> we exploit a property of the ip method to fit all of the above data , for all the stated energies , with a single potential . </S>",
    "<S> the potential is of fixed radial form but the overall strength of each of the imaginary components is proportional to the energy above the inelastic threshold . to minimize the number of parameters the real components are taken to be energy independent .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that fits of @xmath7-matrix to data are inevitably subject to discrete and continuous ambiguities and direct data - to-@xmath31 inversion is not exempt . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties arising at the @xmath44 stage are less important . </S>",
    "<S> various strategies are possible , such as the inclusion of _ a priori _ information from theory  @xcite . here we adopt the approach of using extremely small inversion bases ( two or three gaussian functions ) so that , in effect , we find the smoothest , minimally energy - dependent , potential fitting the data at all six energies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that we can allow the spin orbit terms to be real and parity independent but the central and @xmath1 tensor terms must be complex and and parity dependent . </S>",
    "<S> inversion studies involving fits to both empirical data and rgm theory  @xcite show that interactions between light nuclei are parity dependent for energies up to tens of mev per nucleon . as in earlier work , </S>",
    "<S> we present the real central term in the form of wigner and majorana components : @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath18 and the imaginary terms were treated somewhat differently : the data was reproduced most efficiently with inversion bases covering different radial ranges for the even and odd parity components . in fig .  3 below we </S>",
    "<S> shall see that the odd parity @xmath18 terms cover a wider radial range . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with theoretical arguments  @xcite for the existence of tensor interactions of quite different strengths and shapes for odd and even parity . </S>",
    "<S> the srp consisted only of real , wigner , central and spin - orbit terms . </S>",
    "<S> convergence was very rapid and typically about 3 iterations were required .    </S>",
    "<S> figs 2 and 3 show two alternative potentials fitting the data for the six energies . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependent imaginary parts were evaluated at 10 mev and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 shows the quality of fit to the 10 mev data . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to the data at the ends of the energy range was poorer suggesting that a somewhat less simple energy dependence is required . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath53 values of 8.59 and 8.08 are for the data at all six energies .    </S>",
    "<S> different components of the potential are determined to different degrees of uniqueness . </S>",
    "<S> the real central and spin - orbit wigner potentials shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 are well determined and consistent with predictions of rgm theory . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary central component is highly parity dependent and is emissive near the origin . </S>",
    "<S> all potentials giving a good fit to the data over this energy range have such an emissive region near the nuclear centre . such emissive regions are commonly present  @xcite in potentials found by inverting rgm @xmath7-matrix elements which manifestly do not break unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> emissive regions often appear in local potentials which represent exchange and channel coupling non - locality . in the present case , the unitarity limit is only broken , to a small degree , for @xmath54 , @xmath55 for the @xmath56 and is not broken for the better fit .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath57 interaction shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 departs markedly from previous phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the even parity real and imaginary terms are very strong near @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant for @xmath59 about 1.0 fm ; for @xmath60 the even - parity @xmath57 interaction is ill - determined since the diagonal matrix element of @xmath1 is zero for @xmath61 so the comment concerning irregularities at the nuclear centre in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 applies here . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of strong , short - ranged even - parity components and weaker , long ranged odd - parity components is precisely the pattern predicted to arise from a deuteron exchange mechanism discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which also present a @xmath18 interaction strongly peaked inside @xmath62 fm , but of the opposite sign .    </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis firmly establishes that most terms in the d  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14he potential are substantially parity dependent , casting doubt on parity independent d  @xmath14he potentials , including the potential of frick _ et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with its remarkably large @xmath18 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> rgm theory  @xcite predicts parity dependence for central components , but the strong parity dependence in @xmath18 suggests a new physical process .    in conclusion : </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated for the first time @xmath44 inversion for spin-1 projectiles leading to a tensor interaction which couples channels . </S>",
    "<S> this has been incorporated into a direct data - to - potential inversion procedure yielding a remarkable new kind of @xmath1 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the general procedure could be applied to other cases with channel spin one such as p  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63h scattering . </S>",
    "<S> spin-1 @xmath44 inversion makes it possible to study theories for dynamic polarization and exchange contributions to central and non - central forces for spin-1 projectiles . </S>",
    "<S> the results can then be directly related to phenomenology since , as we have shown here , the inversion procedure can be made part of a powerful , rapidly converging , phenomenological method which , at low computational cost , fits multi - energy datasets with a single , energy dependent potential . </S>"
