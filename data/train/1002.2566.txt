    "the fundamental problem of quantum field theory is the problem of divergences of feynman integrals .",
    "the formal infinities appearing in perturbation expansion of feynman integrals are tackled with different regularization methods , from pauli - villars regularization to renormalization methods for gauge theories , see @xcite for a review .",
    "let us consider the quantum field theory in its euclidean formulation .",
    "the widely known example which fairly illustrates the problem is the @xmath1 interaction model in @xmath2 , see @xcite , determined by the generating functional @xmath3= { \\mathcal{n}}\\int    e^{-\\int d^dx \\left [   \\frac{1}{2}(\\d\\phi)^2+\\frac{m^2}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4   - j\\phi \\right ]   } { \\mathcal{d}}\\phi , \\label{gf1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a formal normalization constant .",
    "the connected green functions are given by variational derivatives of the generating functional : @xmath5}{\\delta j(x_1 ) \\ldots \\delta j(x_n ) } } \\right|_{j=0 } \\label{cgf}\\ ] ] in statistical sense these functions have the meaning of the @xmath6-point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the divergences of feynman graphs in the perturbation expansion of the green functions with respect to the small coupling constant @xmath7 emerge at coinciding arguments @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , the bare two - point correlation function @xmath9 is divergent at @xmath10 for @xmath11 .    since in their correspondence to the @xmath12-valued fields the products @xmath13 have the probability meaning , it is quite obvious physically that neither of the joint probabilities of the measured quantities can be infinite .",
    "the infinities seem to be caused by an inadequate choice of the functional space the fields belong to .",
    "this standard approach inherited from quantum mechanics disregards two important notes :    1 .   to localize a particle in an interval @xmath14 the measuring device requests a momentum transfer of order @xmath15 .",
    "if the value of this momentum is too large we may get out of the applicability range of the initial model , in the sense that @xmath16 at a fixed point @xmath17 has no experimentally verifiable meaning .",
    "what is meaningful , is the vacuum expectation of product of fields in certain region centered around @xmath17 , the width of which ( @xmath14 ) is constrained by the experimental conditions of the measurement .",
    "even if the particle , described by the field @xmath16 , has been initially prepared on the interval @xmath18 , the probability of registering this particle on this interval is generally less than unity : for the probability of registration depends on the strength of interaction and the ratio of typical scales of the measured particle and the measuring equipment .",
    "the maximum probability of registering an object of typical scale @xmath14 by the equipment with typical resolution @xmath19 is achieved when these two parameters are comparable .",
    "for this reason the probability of registering an electron by visual range photon scattering is much higher than by that of long radio - frequency waves . as mathematical generalization",
    ", we should say that if a measuring equipment with a given spatial resolution @xmath19 fails to register an object , prepared on spatial interval of width @xmath14 with certainty , then tuning the equipment to _ all _ possible resolutions @xmath20 would lead to the registration .",
    "this certifies the fact of the existence of the measured object .",
    "most of the regularization methods applied to make the green functions finite imply a certain type of self - similarity  the independence of physical observables on the scale transformation of an arbitrary parameter of the theory  the cutoff length or the normalization scale .",
    "covariance with respect to scale transformations is expressed by renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "another regularization idea based on self - similarity and widely used in lattice gauge theories is the kadanoff blocking procedure , which averages the small - scale fluctuations up to a certain scale into a kind of effective interaction for a larger blocks , assuming the larger blocks interact with each other in the same way as their sub - blocks @xcite .",
    "however the theory based on the fourier transform of fields leaves no place for such self - similarity : the product of fields @xmath21 describes the strength of the interaction of all fluctuations _ up to _ the scale @xmath22 , but says nothing about the interaction strength _ at _ a given scale . an abstract harmonic analysis based on a group @xmath23 , which is wider than the group of translations @xmath24 ,",
    "should be used to account for self - similarity .",
    "the present paper aims to show how the quantum field theory of the scale - dependent fields can be constructed using the continuous wavelet transform , using the decomposition of fields with respect to the representations of the affine group @xmath25 .    in _ section [ cwt : sec ] _ we present a theory of the fields @xmath26 , which explicitly depend on the resolution @xmath14 rather than on the point @xmath17 alone .",
    "the finiteness of the green functions is shown on the simplest example of the scalar field theory with the @xmath1 interaction . in _",
    "section [ caus : sec ] _ we present the commutation relations for the operator - valued scale - dependent fields and apply the region causality relations @xcite to establish a causal ordering for scale - dependent fields . further possible applications of the proposed method , including that to gauge theories , and its existing discrete counterparts are mentioned in",
    "to observe the two notes above we need to modify the definition of the field function . if the ordinary quantum field theory defines the field function @xmath16 as a scalar product of the state vector of the system and the state vector corresponding to the localization at the point @xmath17 : @xmath27 the modified theory should respect the resolution of the measuring equipment .",
    "namely , we define the _ resolution - dependent fields _ @xmath28 also referred to as scale components of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the bra - vector corresponding to localization of the measuring device around the point @xmath17 with the spatial resolution @xmath19 ; @xmath31 labels the apparatus function of the equipment , an _ aperture _ @xcite . in terms of the resolution - dependent field",
    "the unit probability of registering the object @xmath29 anywhere in space at any resolution is expressed by normalization @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a translational - invariant measure , which depends on the position @xmath17 , the resolution @xmath19 , and the aperture @xmath31 .",
    "similarly to representation of a vector @xmath34 in a hilbert space of states @xmath35 as a linear combination of an eigenvectors of momentum operator @xmath36 can be represented as a linear combination of different scale components @xmath37 here , according to @xcite , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 is the left - invariant measure on the affine group @xmath23 ; @xmath40 is a representation of the affine group @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is a _ admissible vector _ , satisfying the condition @xmath43    if the measuring equipment has the resolution @xmath44 , all states @xmath45 are registered with significant probability , but those with @xmath46 are not , the regularization of the model in momentum space , with the cutoff momentum @xmath47 corresponds to the uv - regularized functions @xmath48 the regularized @xmath6-point green functions are @xmath49    however , the momentum cutoff is merely a technical trick : the physical analysis , performed by renormalization group method @xcite , demands the independence of physical results from the cutoff at @xmath50 .    in present paper",
    "we give an alternative , geometrical , interpretation to the cutoff .",
    "we assert that _ if for a given physical system @xmath29 and given measuring equipment there exist the finest resolution scale @xmath44 , so that it is impossible to measure any physical quantity related to @xmath29 with a resolution @xmath46 , then any description of @xmath29 should comprise only such functions , the typical variation scales of which are not less than @xmath44_. this looks like we observe the system @xmath29 _ from outside the scale @xmath44_. the feynman functional integrations in this approach are performed only over the functions with typical scales @xmath51",
    ". our method does not apply any direct cutoff to the momenta  the arguments of the fourier transform .",
    "the momentum conservation in each vertex remains intact .",
    "the calculations can be performed either for the scale - component green functions @xmath52 , or for the integrals of those over the scales @xmath53 .",
    "the technical realization of our scheme is based on the substitution of the fields @xmath54 with @xmath34 given by into the generating functional . in coordinate representation",
    "this is known as the continuous wavelet transform ( see @xcite ) . to keep the scale - dependent fields @xmath55 the same physical dimension",
    "as the ordinary fields @xmath16 we write the coordinate representation of wavelet transform in @xmath56-norm @xcite : @xmath57 in the latter equations the field @xmath58 has a physical meaning of the amplitude of the field @xmath29 measured at point @xmath59 using a device with an aperture @xmath31 and a tunable spatial resolution @xmath19 . for isotropic wavelets @xmath31 the normalization constant @xmath60",
    "is readily evaluated using fourier transform : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the area of unit sphere in @xmath2 .",

    "this is the point to restrict the functional integration in only to the field configurations @xmath68 .",
    "the restriction is imposed at the level of the feynman diagram technique .",
    "indeed , applying the fourier transform to the r.h.s . of ( [ iwt],[dwt ] ) one",
    "yields @xmath69 doing so , we have the following modification of the feynman diagram technique @xcite :    * each field @xmath70 will be substituted by the scale component @xmath71 . *",
    "each integration in momentum variable is accompanied by corresponding scale integration : @xmath72 * each interaction vertex is substituted by its wavelet transform ; for the @xmath73-th power interaction vertex this gives multiplication by factor @xmath74 .",
    "the finiteness of the loop integrals is provided by the following rule : * there should be no scales @xmath75 in internal lines smaller than the minimal scale of all external lines*. therefore the integration in @xmath75 variables is performed from the minimal scale of all external lines up to the infinity .    to illustrate the method we present the calculation of the one - loop contribution to the two- and the four - point green functions in @xmath1 model in @xmath76 .",
    "the best choice of the wavelet function @xmath77 would be the apparatus function of the measuring device , however a simple choice @xmath78 demonstrates the method qualitatively .",
    "the function is well localized in both the coordinate and the momentum spaces , it satisfies the admissibility condition with @xmath79 . due to the property @xmath80 the detector with such aperture is insensitive to constant fields , but detects the gradients of the fields .",

    "we would like to emphasize that in spite of the fact that application of wavelets to quantum field theory is not new , the interpretation of the fields @xmath55 ( or their integrals @xmath111 ) as physical fields yields a finite theory with no need for renormalization .",
    "indeed , the thooft and veltman dimensional regularization scheme @xcite works perfectly well in the presence of the scale factor @xmath44 .",
    "the difference is that the integrated function @xmath112 in @xmath113 where @xmath6 is the formal integration dimension , in our case contains the exponential factor @xmath114 , which suppress all ultraviolet divergences . in the limit @xmath115",

    "for the theory of scale - dependent fields , a stronger microcausality condition @xmath127 may be suggested if the derivation is performed with the generalized causal @xmath128-ordering ( \" the coarse acts first  ) defined in @xcite according to the region causality rules @xcite .",
    "the definition of the generalized causal ordering given in @xcite , is the following : @xmath129 , if the region @xmath14 is inside the region @xmath130 , the operator related to the larger region @xmath130 acts on vacuum first . if the regions @xmath14 and @xmath130 ( the vicinities of two distinct points @xmath131 ) have zero intersection @xmath132 , the causal ordering coincides with usual @xmath128-ordering .",
