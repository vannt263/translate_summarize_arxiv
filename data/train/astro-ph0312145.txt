    "the bright and long gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , grb030329 , was detected on 2003 march 29 11:37:14.67 ut , with the _ hete-2 _ spacecraft ( ricker et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the burst lasted for more than 25 s in the 30 - 400 kev band .",
    "the fluence of the burst was  1 x 10@xmath4 ergs @xmath5 and the peak flux over 1.2 s was @xmath6 7 @xmath7 10@xmath8 ergs @xmath5 s@xmath9 ( i.e. , @xmath6 100 @xmath7 crab flux ) in the same energy band .",
    "the subsequent ground analysis of the _ hete-2 _ data produced an accurate location for the burst , which was reported in a gcn position notice at 12:50:24 ut , 73 minutes after the burst .",
    "the location is centered at @xmath10 , with the 90%-confidence error radius of @xmath11 ( vanderspek et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the optical afterglow was found within the @xmath11-radius error circle at 0.077 days after the burst , at the coordinates of @xmath12 ( peterson and price 2003 ; torii 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift of grb030329 was determined as 0.168 @xmath2 0.001 by numerous absorption and emission lines in the optical spectra of the afterglow ( greiner et al .",
    "2003 ; price et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the afterglow spectrum",
    ", a bright type ic supernova feature appeared at @xmath137.6 days ; the associated supernova has been named sn2003dh ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "2003 ; hjorth et al . 2003 ; chornock et al . 2003 ; zaritsky et al .",
    "this detection strongly suggests a physical link between grbs and supernovae explosion .",
    "uemura et al . ( 2003 ) claim that the optical light curve of the afterglow , produced by their unfiltered observation , deviates from a single power - law decay , exhibiting temporal breaks at 0.085@xmath20.028 , 0.163@xmath20.060 , and 0.227@xmath20.043 days .",
    "we have established a grb follow - up observation system at kiso observatory ( urata et al .",
    "because the japan area had been blank for the grb follow - up observational network , this observational system is very important in studying the temporal and spectral evolution of early ( @xmath141 day ) afterglows .",
    "another merit of the system is its multi - color capability , using two instruments ( 2k@xmath72k ccd and konic ) and @xmath15- , @xmath16- , @xmath0- , @xmath17- , @xmath18- , @xmath19- , and @xmath20-bandpass filters ( urata et al . 2003 ) .",
    "we have already performed early optical color measurements of a number of grb afterglows . in the present burst ,",
    "we have also performed an early @xmath0-band follow - up observation of the afterglow , from 0.072 to 0.253 days .",
    "here we study the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow over a very early phase ( 0.065 to 0.286 days ) , by combining our kiso measurements with the published photometric points from the siding spring observatory ( sso0 40-inch telescope ( price et al.2003 ) , and the 1.5 m russian - turkish telescope ( rtt150 ) by burenin et al .",
    "we carried out @xmath0-band follow - up observations of the optical afterglow of grb030329 , using the system described in section 1 .",
    "specifically , we used the 1.05 m schmidt telescope and a 2k@xmath72k ccd camera at kiso observatory , the university of tokyo .",
    "the field of view was @xmath21 and the pixel size was @xmath22 square .",
    "the observation started at 2003 march 13:21:26 ut ( 0.075 days ) , and ended at 17:43:16 ( 0.253 days ) .",
    "meanwhile , we acquired 36 @xmath0-band images in total , mostly with 60-s exposure .",
    "an example of the @xmath0-band image we obtained is shown in figure 1 , where the afterglow is extremely bright .",
    "the data reduction was carried out by a standard method using the noao iraf .",
    "we performed the dark - subtraction and flat - fielding correction using appropriate calibration data .",
    "the photometric calibrations were done for all frames using apphot package in iraf , with 7 standard stars around the afterglow suggested by henden ( 2003 ) .",
    "we indicate these standard stars in figure 1 . for each data",
    ", we set the one - dimensional aperture size to 4 times as large as the full - width at half maximum of the objects .",
    "the magnitude error in each optical images is estimated as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the photometric errors of grb030329 afterglow , estimated from the output of iraf phot , and @xmath25 is the photometric calibration error estimated by comparing our instrumental magnitude of the 7 standard stars over the 36 frames .",
    "the typical errors are @xmath26 mag . for photometric , and @xmath27 mag . for systematic .",
    "in figure 2 , we plot the @xmath0-band light curve of the afterglow of grb030329 based on our photometry .",
    "the light curve is well fitted with a single power law function of the form @xmath28 , where t is the time after the burst and @xmath29 is the decay index ; we have obtained @xmath30 with reduced chi - squared @xmath31 of 0.819 for @xmath32 34 . in order to better constrain the early - time ( @xmath14 0.25 day ) behavior of the light curve , we combined our data with the two @xmath0-band photometric points reported by price et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using the sso 40-inch telescope ; @xmath3=12.6@xmath20.015 mag . at 0.065",
    "day , and @xmath3=12.786@xmath20.017 mag . at 0.073 day .",
    "these are among the earliest filtered observations of this afterglow .",
    "we have successfully fitted the combined @xmath0-band light curve again with a single power law , of which the decay index is 0.891@xmath20.003 with @xmath33=0.817 for @xmath34 .",
    "we have further included 13 @xmath0-band photometric data points obtained at about 0.3 days after the burst by burenin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using the russian - turkish telescope ( rtt150 ) , but the results did not change either ; the decay index is @xmath35 , with @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we observed the optical afterglow associated with grb030329 from 0.072 to 0.253 days after the burst . the light curve based on our photometry",
    "is well fitted by a single power law function with a decay index of @xmath38 .",
    "the result remains essentially unchanged when we include the published two sso data points ( price et al .",
    "2003 ) covering an even earlier phase ( up to 0.065 days ) , and the published 13 rtt150 data points ( burenin et al .",
    "2003 ) taken at about 0.3 days .",
    "thus , our single power - law representation of the @xmath0-band decay light curve is valid altogether over a period of 0.0650.285 days after the burst .",
    "uemura et al . ( 2003 ) reported that their unfiltered light curve has three temporal breaks , at @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 days , across which the power - law decay index changes by 0.20.5 . in figure 2 , we have plotted their best - fit model function , together with the @xmath42 magnitude constant error suggested by them . because the model normalization is not specified by uemura et al ( 2003 ) , we estimated it using 0.2 day data points of their figure 1 .",
    "although their measurements are thus consistent with ours within their measurement errors , the reality of the suggested breaks remain an important issue to be clarified .    for a more quantitative examination of the issue",
    ", we split our data into three phases , namely @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , each covering one of the three reported breaks .",
    "we then fitted each of these light curve segments with a single power - law , and obtained the results as summarized in table 1 .",
    "thus , the three segments are all expressed adequately with a single power - law , and the derived decay indices do not differ by more than 0.13 .",
    "we also tried to fit our light curve with the smoothly broken power - law model used by uemura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which is expressed as @xmath46 with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , where @xmath49 is the time after the burst onset , @xmath50 is the @xmath51-band flux , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the decay indices at early and late times respectively , @xmath54 is a normalization constant , and @xmath55 indicates a smoothness parameter .",
    "the break times were fixed to the values reported by uemura et al .",
    "furthermore , we fixed @xmath55 at unity after uemura et al ( 2003 ) when fitting the @xmath56 phase .",
    "the results from this analysis are again summarized in table 1 . in the first and the third time segments ,",
    "the slope change is thus insignificant ( at most 0.1 ) and the decay indices before and after the assumed break are all consistent with the global value of 0.89 . although a break is apparently suggested by the second segment , an f - test indicates that the improvement of the broken power - law model over the single power - law is not significant at the 90% confidence level .",
    "thus , our high - quality @xmath0-band light curve does not show any evidence for the wriggle structure reported by uemura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we further tried to fit the present light curve ( kiso , sso , and rtt150 ) with the best - fit model function reported by uemura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in which the over all normalization alone is allowed to vary .",
    "the fitting has yielded with @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "based on this large value of @xmath59 , we can rule out the model of uemura et al .",
    "( 2003 ) at more than 99.99% confidence level .",
    "a discrepancy between the filtered and unfiltered light curves could arise if there were significant color changes during the decay . in this case , a similar deviation from a single power - law decay should be observed in unfiltered light curves by other observers .",
    "however , there is no such structures in the unfiltered light curve obtained by torii et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; it is fitted successfully by a single power law with a decay index of @xmath60 , in a good agreement with the present result .",
    "furthermore uemura et al . ( 2003 ) report that their unfiltered ccd has response close to that of the @xmath0- system .",
    "therefore , the origin of the discrepancy must be found somewhere else .",
    "we thank many high school students who participated in the education program at kiso observatory in the night to collaborate with us .",
    "we also thank rtt150 collaboration for their observations as well as for making their data publicly available .",
