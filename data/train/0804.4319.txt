    "jet suppression in heavy ion collisions poses questions about the fate of the away - side parton and its lost energy . as jet reconstruction is difficult with heavy ion background levels , we study jet physics via two particle correlations where the backgrounds are subtracted statistically@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the descriptions of this analysis methodology within @xcite .",
    "( color online ) per trigger conditional yields for inclusive photons , @xmath6 gev/@xmath2 , paired with charged hadron partners , @xmath7 gev/@xmath2 , in p+p and au+au collisions , ( a ) and ( b ) respectively . ]    in p - p and d - au collisions we find back to back production of jets , but in central heavy ion collisions we have the development of two new structures , one on the near - side and another on the away - side@xcite@xcite .",
    "we demonstrate these findings in fig.[fig : cfs ] where we have measured these correlations in both the azimuthal angular difference , @xmath8 , and the pseudo - rapidity difference , @xmath3 , between two particles . in p - p collisions , shown in fig.[fig : cfs](a ) , we see the near - side jet , narrow in @xmath3 , and the away - side jet , broad in @xmath3 due to the swing of the away - side parton . in contrast , the near - side correlations in heavy ion collisions , shown in fig.[fig : cfs](b ) , broaden in @xmath3 .",
    "this structure is referred to as the `` ridge '' .",
    "the away - side jet is broadened in azimuth with a yield depletion around @xmath9 ( hereafter called the `` head '' ) and a yield enhancement at @xmath10 ( hereafter called the `` shoulder '' ) .",
    "we conjecture that the head is often dominated by jet suppression and the shoulder by medium response",
    ". therefore separation of these regions allows study of the interaction between partons and the medium .",
    "we have in phenix two methods for decomposing the away - side structure to isolate the characteristics of the shoulder mechanism .",
    "the first , the bin method , has the advantage of being model - independent .",
    "this method measures the physics of the dominant contribution inside a fixed bin in @xmath8 and suffers in some cases due to production from multiple sources .",
    "the other , the fit method , decomposes the away - side via a multi - gaussian fit of the form :    @xmath11    this method has the disadvantage of being model - dependent , but should better separate contributions from multiple sources .",
    "a extensive study of away - side correlations as a function of @xmath1 selection has been carried out @xcite . at high @xmath1",
    "the away - side peak is similar in shape but suppressed in yield compared to p - p collisions .",
    "below @xmath12 4 gev/@xmath2 the away - side broadens with the head being suppressed in yield and the shoulder showing yield enhancement .",
    "the latter is found to be more prominent as the associated particle @xmath1 decreases @xcite .",
    "measurements of the shoulder @xmath8 maximum have been made via the fit method and show its location is largely independent of both partner and trigger @xmath1 selections@xcite .",
    "this disfavors theoretical models which predict a @xmath1 dependent location .",
    "we have also measured the away - side particle species dependence .",
    "we find that the correlation shape is similar for both meson and baryon partners .",
    "the baryon to meson ratio of per trigger associated yields increases from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "this trend is incompatible with in - vacuum fragmentation , but similar to the behavior of the inclusive baryon and meson yields .",
    "furthermore , we have measured the away - side spectral slopes . above @xmath13 of 100 where the shoulder mechanism dominates",
    ", we find that the spectra are softer than in p - p collisions .",
    "the spectra also show the same @xmath1 independence that has been measured in other shoulder properties but contrasts the expectation from p - p measurements@xcite .",
    "( color online ) jet functions with charged hadron triggers , @xmath14 gev/@xmath2 , paired with charged hadron partners , @xmath15 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "central collisions , 0 - 5% , are shown in ( a ) & ( b ) , in - plane and out - of - plane respectively .",
    "mid - central collisions , 30 - 40% , shown in ( c ) & ( d ) , again in - plane and out - of - plane respectively .",
    "systematic errors are correlated or anti - correlated , as indicated by solid and dashed lines . ]    path length dependence to the away - side shoulder was probed by binning the triggers with respect to the reaction plane using the new reaction plane detector installed in run7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rxpn ] we examine a case of little geometry variation in central 0 - 5% collisions and find no dependence with reaction plane .",
    "when we examine a case of large geometry variation at 30 - 40% centrality , we find a slight variation with reaction plane , but this may be covered by the current uncertainties .",
    "the anti - correlating systematic errors are influential in trend determination .",
    "as understanding of the new reaction plane detector improves , this key source of systematic error should improve .",
    "in the near - side , we have measured the per trigger yield with respect to p - p collisions via the ratio @xmath16 .",
    "we find that the near - side yield enhancement also appears in the same @xmath1 range , @xmath0 4 gev/@xmath2 , as the away - side enhancement .",
    "the highest @xmath1 selections again show a similarity to p - p , though now without suppression@xcite .    we have also measured the near - side baryon to meson ratios and find that like the away - side the trends move from p - p values towards the inclusive measurements .",
    "since the near - side jet is not suppressed , the ratios can not achieve an inclusive - like particle mixture in the most central events@xcite .",
    "softening of spectral slopes relative to p - p is witnessed for the near - side , again similar to findings in the away - side .",
    "we have measured the near - side distributions projected along @xmath3 compared to p - p .",
    "this verifies that the near - side enhancement measured is broad within our acceptance .",
    "higher @xmath1 selections match the @xmath3 profile of p - p . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cfs ] , outside of 0.5 @xmath17 we have access to a region relatively free of p - p like production for a selection of @xmath1 ranges@xcite .",

[",
    "fig : rscent ] we show the ridge and shoulder have similar centrality dependencies .",
    "we have also measured the total partner @xmath1 in the near- and away - side , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rsbal ] . we find in a narrow pseudo - rapidity window ,",
    "near - side jet and ridge components balance with the shoulder and head components . by selecting a wide pseudo - rapidity bin",
    ", we drop the near - side jet contribution and find that the remaining ridge component balances with the shoulder component alone .",
    "possible independent production of ridge and shoulder leads to no expectation that this should be so . using this technique",
    "we have also measured the shoulder and ridge spectra and confirm that the spectra are softer than their p - p counterparts .",
    "the shoulder is closest to the inclusive spectral slopes with the ridge being slightly harder@xcite .",
    "the ridge - shoulder similarity found in so many of the measurements may be the result of triggering on the medium response .",
    "if the true shoulder mechanism is two - sided and broad in @xmath3 , a trigger arising from the medium response would pair with other medium response particles at both 0 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have evidence from @xmath16 reported in @xcite that the triggers below @xmath0 7 gev/@xmath2 have significant contributions other than jet fragmentation .",
    "triggers from jet fragmentation and medium response would mix ridge and shoulder production ( should they be produced separate phenomena at all ) and could be responsible for some of the similarities witnessed in the data .",
    "phenix is performing measurements of both the ridge and the shoulder .",
    "both structures are inconsistent with in - vacuum jet fragmentation . the ridge and the shoulder share much of the same behavior .",
    "they appear at similar @xmath1 .",
    "they have a similar centrality dependence .",
    "they are softer than their p - p counterparts .",
    "they have baryon to meson ratios larger than jet fragmentation . and ,",
    "finally , they balance in @xmath1 .",
    "these similarities suggest that the ridge and shoulder may share a common production mechanism .",
