    "the afterglow of the grb 000301c is one of the best observed to date , its emission having been monitored over 1.5 decades in time at radio frequencies ( berger 2000 ) and in the optical ( bhargavi & cowsik 2000 , masetti 2000 , sagar 2000 , jensen 2001 , rhoads & fruchter 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , 000301c is one of three afterglows whose optical emission decay exhibited a strong steepening ( break ) at few days .",
    "the steepening follows a flattening , or mild brightening , in the optical light - curve .",
    "the break in the optical emission was attributed to a jet geometry by berger ( 2000 ) , while the relatively short - lived brightening at 35 days was interpreted by garnavich , loeb & stanek ( 2000 ) as evidence for gravitational microlensing due to a star in a intervening galaxy .",
    "rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) point out that the sharpness of the optical break poses difficulties for a jet interpretation .    in this work we model the emission of 000301c in the framework of relativistic ejecta energizing the swept - up gas surrounding the grb source ( mszros & rees 1997 ) .",
    "our aims are to assess the ability of the jet model to accommodate the behaviors exhibited by the radio - to - optical emission of 000301c and to determine its basic physical parameters ( jet energy , initial opening , surrounding medium density , etc ) .",
    "furthermore , by including microlensing in our model , we also test its ability to reproduce the optical brightening seen around 3.5 days .",
    "the jet dynamics is given by a set of differential equations ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) for the lorentz factor @xmath10 , mass , and aperture @xmath11 of the jet as functions of radius @xmath12 .",
    "the jet lateral spreading is negligible in the early phase of the expansion . in the adiabatic limit",
    ", the jet lorentz factor evolves as @xmath13 for a uniform external medium , where @xmath14 is the observer time , and as @xmath15 for a medium whose density decreases as @xmath16 ( mszros , rees & wijers 1999 ) , for a wind ejected at constant speed before the release of the relativistic jet .",
    "the lateral spreading increases the jet sweeping area and alters significantly its dynamics when @xmath10 drops below @xmath17 ( rhoads 1999 ) , the jet deceleration becoming exponential , @xmath18 , as long as the jet is sufficiently relativistic ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we calculate numerically the jet dynamics , taking into account the energy loss through emission of radiation .",
    "the jet is assumed to have sharp boundaries and to be uniform , with no angular gradients ( of energy or mass ) within its aperture . from the dynamics of the jet",
    ", one can calculate the properties of the shocked fluid ( density , magnetic field , typical electron random lorentz factor ) , which are necessary for the computation of the synchrotron emission .",
    "we assume that the shock injects in the downstream region relativistic electrons with a power - law distribution , and approximate the distribution of electrons resulting from injection and cooling as a dual power - law ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , with a minimum and a break set by the injected ( @xmath20 ) and cooling ( @xmath21 ) electron lorentz factors .",
    "this approximation allows some analytical results for the self - absorption frequency , compton parameter , radiative losses , and peak synchrotron flux to be implemented in the code , avoiding thus time - consuming integrations over the electron distribution .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of this approximation and find that it is very good if radiative losses are small .",
    "for significant radiative losses ( above 50% ) it may mis - estimate the electron distribution and @xmath21 by a factor @xmath22 , thus the model fluxes in some frequency ranges at for certain durations may be off by a similar factor .    in the calculation of the afterglow emission",
    "we allow for the existence of a high energy break at @xmath23 in the electron distribution , at which the shock - acceleration becomes inefficient .",
    "this break could be due to the escape of particles from the acceleration region and to radiative cooling during acceleration , and becomes important if the emission from @xmath23-electrons crosses an observational band . in this case",
    "the resulting afterglow emission fall - off depends on the exact shape of the electron distribution at and above @xmath23 .",
    "for simplicity we shall assume that at @xmath23 there is a sharp transition to a steeper power - law .",
    "the afterglow spectrum has three breaks : the synchrotron characteristic frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 at which the @xmath20- and @xmath21-electrons radiate , and the self - absorption frequency @xmath26 . between these breaks the spectrum is a power - law of an index dependent on the ordering of the breaks ( sari 1998 ) .",
    "the steepening of the electron distribution at @xmath23 adds another break , at the frequency @xmath27 at which the @xmath23-electrons radiate .",
    "as the jet is decelerated , these four frequencies evolve , the passage of one of them through an observing band yielding a chromatic steepening of the afterglow emission fall - off .",
    "furthermore an achromatic steepening of the afterglow decay is expected around the time when , due to the decrease of the relativistic beaming of the afterglow emission , the jet edge becomes visible to the observer ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "in our treatment , the afterglow model has 8 parameters .",
    "three of them give the jet dynamics : + @xmath28 , the jet energy at the end of the grb phase + @xmath29 , the initial jet aperture ( half - angle ) + @xmath30 , the particle density of the uniform external medium or the parameter @xmath31 for a medium with a density profile @xmath32 , resulting from the ejection by the grb progenitor of a wind with mass loss rate @xmath33 and constant speed @xmath34 .",
    "the other five are parameters for the microphysics of shock acceleration and generation of magnetic fields , and determine the spectrum of the emergent synchrotron emission : + @xmath35 , the ratio of the magnetic energy density to the energy density of the freshly shocked fluid .",
    "+ @xmath36 , the ratio of the energy density of newly accelerated electrons , if they all had the minimum lorentz factor @xmath20 , to the energy density of the post - shock gas .",
    "this parameter quantifies @xmath20 .",
    "+ @xmath37 , the index of the power - law distribution @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) of the injected electrons .",
    "+ @xmath40 ( greater than @xmath41 ) , the fractional internal energy stored in electrons .",
    "this parameter determines the high - energy break @xmath23 of the electron distribution for @xmath42 and any @xmath43 or for @xmath44 and @xmath45      \\epsel$ ] .",
    "+ @xmath46 , the steepening of electron distribution index above @xmath23 .",
    "a quantitative description of these five parameters can be found in panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) .",
    "we note that , if the jet evolution is quasi - adiabatic , then its dynamics and the afterglow emission are independent on @xmath47 . if radiative losses are significant , the afterglow emission depends on @xmath47 because the magnitude and evolution of the radiative losses is @xmath47-dependent . however , this dependence is rather weak , so that the data can not be used to obtain meaningful constraints on the initial jet lorentz factor . for this reason we shall keep it fixed : @xmath48 .    in the calculation of the radiative losses and cooling frequency we take into account synchrotron self - absorption and inverse compton scatterings ( which may be dominant if the magnetic field is sufficiently weak ) .",
    "the received synchrotron flux is calculated by integrating it over the jet evolution , taking into account the effect of the source relativistic motion and spherical curvature on the photon arrival time and energy , but ignoring the light shell - crossing time .",
    "the observer is assumed to lie on the jet axis .",
    "fluctuations on a short timescale of the radio emission of grb afterglows , caused by inhomogeneities in the galactic interstellar medium have been predicted by goodman ( 1997 ) .",
    "as shown by berger ( 2000 ) , the well - sampled 8.46 ghz emission of 000301c exhibits such fluctuations .",
    "we include the effect of the interstellar scintillation ( iss ) by adding in quadrature to the reported errors the expected amplitude of the model flux fluctuations due to iss .",
    "the calculation of the modulation amplitude follows the treatment given by walker ( 1998 ) , and is summarized below .    at a frequency @xmath49 below a certain critical value @xmath50 ,",
    "scintillation occurs in the strong regime .",
    "_ diffractive _ scintillation ( ds ) is caused by the interference of light coming from many patches of coherence within the `` refractive '' disk of size @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular size of the first fresnel zone at the critical frequency @xmath50 .",
    "ds has amplitude @xmath53 if the source is point - like ( its size @xmath54 is smaller than @xmath55^{6/5}$ ] ) and if the observing window is narrower than the decorrelation bandwidth @xmath56 . for an  extended \" source ( @xmath57 ) the modulation index",
    "is reduced to @xmath58 .",
    "_ refractive _ scintillation ( rs ) is due to inhomogeneities in the scattering screen on the refractive disk scale . in the strong scattering regime",
    "the rs amplitude is @xmath59 if @xmath60 , while for @xmath61 the modulation index is @xmath62 . at frequencies above @xmath50",
    ", rs occurs in the weak scattering regime and have amplitude @xmath63 if @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the size of the fresnel zone . for @xmath66 the rs amplitude is reduced to @xmath67 .",
    "the amplitude of the radio iss depends therefore on two properties of the interstellar medium , @xmath50 and @xmath52 , which depend on the scattering measure and distance to the scattering screen .",
    "the maps of walker ( 1998 ) give @xmath68 and @xmath69 ghz in the direction of grb 000301c , thus the measurements at the two lowest frequencies ( 4.86 ghz and 8.45 ghz ) are close to the critical frequency .",
    "the above equations for the iss amplitude are asymptotic results , strictly valid at frequencies far from @xmath50 , and slightly overestimate the modulation amplitude at @xmath70 .",
    "for this reason we set an upper limit of 50% to the modulation index calculated with the asymptotic results above .",
    "the source size @xmath54 , on which the iss modulation may depend , can be easily calculated analytically at times before lateral expansion becomes important . during this phase",
    "the jet aperture @xmath11 exceeds @xmath71 , thus the observer receives photons mostly from a spherical cap of opening @xmath72 around the jet axis .",
    "therefore the size of the source seen by the observer is @xmath73 . for a uniform medium ( @xmath74 )",
    "it can be shown that a photon emitted by the fluid moving off - axis at an angle @xmath75 arrives at observer 5 times later than of a photon traveling along the jet axis . for a wind - like medium ( @xmath76 )",
    "the above factor is 3 . applying these correction factors to the expressions for the fireball radius given by panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) , which contain the arrival time of the photons emitted along the jet axis , we obtain _",
    "s = 0.89 d_a,28 ^ -1 ( 1+z)^-5/8 ( e_0,53/n_0)^1/8 t_d^5/8 [ thetas0 ] for a homogeneous medium and _ s = 0.60 d_a,28 ^ -1 ( 1+z)^-3/4 ( e_0,53/a_*)^1/4 t_d^3/4 , [ thetas2 ] for a wind - like medium , where @xmath77 is the jet isotropic equivalent energy and @xmath78 is @xmath79 normalized to the value corresponding to the ejection of @xmath80 at @xmath81 ) . in equations ( [ thetas0 ] ) and ( [ thetas2 ] )",
    "@xmath82 is the angular distance for redshift @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the observer time measured in days , and the usual scaling @xmath85 was used .",
    "after @xmath10 drops below @xmath17 , which is roughly the onset time of the lateral spreading dominated phase , the source size is @xmath86 .",
    "this quantity and the arrival time of photons emitted from the jet edge are calculated numerically .",
    "the decay of the near infrared ( nir ) and optical emission of 000301c exhibits a modest brightening at 35 days , which appears to be achromatic in the optical ( berger 2000 , bhargavi & cowsik 2000 ) , although there is evidence for @xmath87 color evolution during it ( rhoads & fruchter 2001 ) . garnavich ( 2000b ) have proposed gravitational microlensing as an explanation for this feature , though other possibilities  inhomogeneities in the external medium , delayed energy injection , departures of the electron distribution from a power - law  can not be ruled out given the lack of well sampled , simultaneous measurements in other frequency domains and of a detailed analysis of the chromaticity of the brightening in all these scenarios .",
    "we include microlensing in our modeling to assess its ability to explain the brightening of the 000301c afterglow .",
    "unlike the other scenarios mentioned above , lensing is  external \" to the afterglow modeling , as it does not modify the jet dynamics .",
    "better yet , it introduces only two free parameters : + @xmath88 , the apparent separation between the lens and the center of the grb remnant and + @xmath89 , the angular size of the einstein disk , which depends on the lens mass and distance to the observer .",
    "thus the total number of parameters of the afterglow model with lensing is 10 .    as pointed out by loeb & perna ( 1998 ) , a time - varying magnification of afterglows results when the expanding source ( and [ [ thetas2 ] ] ) crosses the einstein disk .",
    "the effect is enhanced by that the source has a non - uniform surface brightness distribution , with most of the optical emission coming from the outer part of the visible disk .",
    "these two factors are taken into account in our calculations by integrating over the jet surface the flux received from each infinitesimal patch multiplied by the magnification factor = , where @xmath90 is the angular separation ( on the sky ) between the patch and the lens , measured in units of @xmath91 .",
    "we note some important differences between the model used by garnavich ( 2000b ) and ours .",
    "we calculate the afterglow emission from the jet dynamics instead of approximating it with a smoothed broken power - law .",
    "the source surface brightness distribution is implicitly taken into account by our integration of the afterglow emission .",
    "thus we do not approximate the afterglow image as a ring , with zero brightness inside the ring .",
    "garnavich ( 2000b ) used a free normalization factor for the afterglow emission in each of the 7 observational bands included in their fit .",
    "this allows a rather excessive freedom to their model , given that the afterglow spectrum in nir  optical is a power - law , thus the normalizing factor at one frequency determines the factors for all other bands .",
    "all these differences point to that our model has significantly less freedom than that of garnavich ( 2000b ) .",
    "the afterglow data which we model are taken from bhargavi & cowsik ( 2000 ) , berger ( 2000 ) , masetti ( 2000 ) , sagar ( 2000 ) , jensen ( 2001 ) , and rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) .",
    "some of these articles list measurements reported in gcn circulars by bernabei ( 2000 ) , gal - yam ( 2000 ) , garnavich ( 2000a ) , halpern ( 2000 ) , kobayashi ( 2000 ) , mujica ( 2000 ) , and veillet & boer ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have excluded the earliest @xmath8-band magnitude reported by sagar ( 2000 ) , which is inconsistent at the @xmath92 level with an almost simultaneous measurement by bhargavi & cowsik ( 2000 ) , and the @xmath93 flux reported by smette ( 2001 ) , which could be affected by intergalactic ly@xmath94 absorption .",
    "we have averaged measurements separated by less than 0.01 day , whether they were independent observations or the same data analyzed and reported by different workers .",
    "the final data set contains 140 points .",
    "the nir and optical magnitudes have been converted to fluxes using the photometric zero points published by campins , rieke , & lebofsky ( 1985 ) , and fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa ( 1995 ) . to account for magnitude - to - flux conversion uncertainty",
    "we add 5% in quadrature to the reported uncertainties , noting that most of these uncertainties are equal to or exceed 5% .",
    "the nir and optical fluxes have corrected for galactic extinction with @xmath95 ( rhoads & fruchter 2001 ) , but no correction was made for a possible reddening in the afterglow s host galaxy .    throughout this work we denote by @xmath94 and @xmath96 the indices of the power - law afterglow light - curve and spectrum : f_(t ) ^- t^- .",

    "jensen ( 2001 ) and rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) attribute this departure from the power - law spectrum expected in the fireball model to extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "we note that softening of the nir  optical spectrum , if real , suggests an intrinsic feature of the afterglow , as caused by a spectral break whose frequency decreases , passing through the optical domain .",
    "given that the fastest possible decrease of the cooling frequency is @xmath110 ( see panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) and that the steepening @xmath111 of the spectrum across @xmath25 is smooth , it seems rather unlikely that the passage of @xmath25 would produce a detectable afterglow softening over a short timescale .",

    "it is also possible that the chromatic evolution of the afterglow between 2 and 5 days is caused by the same mechanism that yields the optical brightening seen at @xmath112 days .",
    "most likely this excludes microlensing as the brightening mechanism , as lensing should not produce a chromatic afterglow behavior over less than a decade in frequency ( note that , in general , microlensing of afterglows leaves chromatic signatures because the surface brightness profile of the source is wavelength - dependent ) .      the 8.46 ghz _",

    ", relativistic jets can not produce significantly different decay indices at frequencies that are a factor of only two apart , so we presume that the light - curve indices at 4.86 ghz and 8.46 ghz are in fact the same and that the discrepancy can be resolved by interstellar scintillation .",

    "the nir and _ optical _ emission of 000301c exhibited a break at few days . using a smoothed dual power - law fit , rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) found a steepening from an asymptotic @xmath120 at early times to @xmath121 at late times , in the @xmath102 band , and from @xmath122 to @xmath123 in the @xmath8 band . using a broken power - law approximation , jensen ( 2001 ) found @xmath124 and @xmath125 . at late times ,",

    "it is thus hard to see how collimation of ejecta could account alone for the magnitude @xmath131 of the optical break of 000301c , unless the afterglow decay before 3 days is significantly flattened by the brightening mechanism we see at 35 days , so that the observed decay index @xmath132 is smaller than that the afterglow would have if this mechanism were not present . given that it takes more than two decades in time to a jet expanding into an @xmath133 medium to yield about 90% of the full break magnitude ( kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) , the @xmath131 above rules out a model with a wind - like medium and an afterglow steepening due only to collimated ejecta .",
    "we start with a model where the high energy spectral break @xmath27 is well above the optical domain and the light - curve steepening is due solely to the collimation of ejecta . in this case",
    "the external medium must be homogeneous , so that the light - curve steepening at the time @xmath134 , when the jet edge becomes visible , is as fast as possible .",
    "if the cooling frequency were below the nir - optical domain , then @xmath135 , thus the observed slope at 5 days ( ) , after the optical brightening , would require @xmath136 .",
    "then the decay index of the optical emission at @xmath137 would approach asymptotically @xmath138 , and would be shallower than observed ( ) .",
    "therefore the cooling frequency should be above the nir  optical domain .    at few days",
    ", the injection frequency @xmath24 must be below the millimeter range , to explain the decay of the 250 ghz emission (  [ index ] , figure 2 ) .",
    "then @xmath139 and the observations at 5 days ( ) lead to @xmath140 , which is still below @xmath141",
    ". therefore it may be difficult to reconcile within the jet model the spectrum and the late time optical decay of 000301c .",
    "the best fit obtained with a jet model having the cooling frequency above optical and a homogeneous external medium is shown in figure 2 .",
    "its @xmath142 for 132 degrees of freedom ( df ) is large in part because microlensing does not produce the brightening seen around 3.5 days , for reasons discussed below , the 28 nir / optical measurements between 3.0 and 4.3 days yielding @xmath143 . to test the ability of only the jet model to account for the general features of 000301c ,",
    "we eliminate the 3.04.3 days data and microlensing from the modeling .",
    "the new best fit has @xmath144 for 98 df ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "one reason for which the new @xmath145 is still large is that a relativistic jet yields the same @xmath146 decay after @xmath134 at all frequencies above @xmath24 .",
    "however , in 000301 , the late time decay indices of the 8.46 ghz and @xmath8-band light - curves differ significantly . for the jet models shown in figure 2 , the 14 measurements made at 8.46 ghz after 30 days yield @xmath147 .",
    "berger ( 2000 ) explain this discrepancy ( see their figure 2 ) between the jet model and the radio emission of 000301c as the result of interstellar scintillation . even if iss were strong enough to accommodate the observations , the radio data should have been randomly scattered around the model light - curve , both having the same trend , which is unlike the behaviors illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the results of figure 2 point to yet another reason for the large @xmath145 we obtain : the optical steepening of 000301c is too fast and too large to be explained with a jet break , as was expected based on analytical considerations (  [ index ] ) . for this reason we turn now to a  modified jet model \" , where the passage through the optical of the @xmath27 break associated with the steepening of the electron distribution at @xmath23 yields a light - curve steepening . as noted in  [ spectrum ] ,",
    "the passage of a spectral break is suggested by the softening of the nir  optical spectrum ( ) . the time and magnitude of the light - curve break caused by",
    "the @xmath27-crossing depend on the location of @xmath23 and on the steepening of the electron distribution at @xmath23 , the parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 introduced in  [ synchro ] .",
    "first note that , within the jet model , the quasi - constant 8.46 ghz emission prior to 30 days has two possible explanations : + @xmath0 the ejecta are collimated , the jet edge becoming visible at few days , so that @xmath150 before the passage of @xmath24 and @xmath151 after that .",
    "these analytical results ( rhoads 1999 ) are not very accurate for moderately relativistic jets ( @xmath152 ) , where we find numerically smaller decay indices . nevertheless a hard electron distribution , with @xmath153 ,",

    "note that , in either case , the modified jet yields a significantly better fit than the `` traditional '' jet model with @xmath44 and optical steepening caused by collimation .",
    "the best fits obtained with a modified jet and a _ wind - like _ medium are shown in figure 4 . without microlensing and the 3.04.3 days data",
    ", it has @xmath163 for 96 df , being unacceptable .",
    "the light - curves shown in figures 3 and 4 prove that , for either type of external medium , microlensing does not yield an afterglow brightening but only a flattening , for the reasons discussed below .    as found by many researchers ( waxman 1997 , panaitescu & mszros 1998 , sari 1998 , granot , piran , & sari 1999 ) , at high frequencies , a spherical",
    ", relativistic fireball appears as a disk whose brightness surface increases toward the edge . an increasing magnification through lensing",
    "requires that the source is initially outside the einstein disk .",
    "the peak magnification is obtained when , due to the source expansion ( and [ [ thetas2 ] ] ) , its edge crosses the einstein disk .",
    "a significant magnification for a short duration ( 12 days for 000301c ) constrains the size of the einstein disk in two ways : it can not be much smaller than the source size at the time of maximum lensing , as in this case the magnification would be weak , but it can not be larger than it either , because the lensing event would last longer than the time when the maximum magnification is produced ( 34 days for 00301c ) . for the jet models with microlensing presented in figure 24 , the evolution of the source size and of the surface brightness distribution are such that the best fits are obtained if , at the time of maximum magnification ( @xmath112 days ) , the afterglow apparent size is twice larger than the einstein disk . for this source",
    " lens geometry , the source is too large for microlensing to yield a peaked light - curve .",
    "garnavich ( 2000b ) have obtained peaked lensed light - curves by approximating the source image with an annulus , whose fractional width ( 16% ) was obtained by fitting the data .",
    "granot & loeb ( 2001 ) have calculated microlensed light - curves using the surface brightness distribution of a spherical , relativistic afterglow , and have found a peak magnification factor @xmath164 , supporting the microlensing model of garnavich ( 2000 ) for 000301c .",
    "we note , however , that in 000301c , the optical brightening occurs at times when jet effects are important , thus the source geometry and dynamics are not those expected for a spherical fireball . according to ioka & nakamura ( 2001 ) , the surface brightness distribution of a spreading jet is rather uniform .",
    "we also note that , at the time of optical brightening , the jets of figure 3 and 4 are not very relativistic ( @xmath165 several ) , which makes the surface brightness distribution even more uniform .",
    "therefore , in our modeling of 000301c , jet effects and the mildly relativistic motion of the source lead to an afterglow whose image at optical frequencies is not like the narrow ring envisaged by garnavich ( 2000b ) , but more like a disk .",
    "the analysis presented in  [ models ] shows that the  traditional \" jet model can not reconcile the late time decay indices of the 8.5 ghz and @xmath8-band light - curves of 000301c , and can not account for the magnitude of the steepening exhibited by decay of its optical emission .",
    "we attribute the latter to the passage of a spectral break @xmath27 associated with a steepening of the power - law electron distribution at high lorentz factors .",
    "this also provides a natural explanation for the curvature of the optical spectrum observed by jensen ( 2001 ) without the help of host extinction , and for the possible softening of the nir  optical spectrum implied by the results of jensen ( 2001 ) and rhoads & fruchter ( 2001 ) , at about the same time when the steepening of the optical fall - off of 000301c occurred .",
    "note that a chromatic evolution of the afterglow emission over less than a decade in frequency can not be due to microlensing or to jet effects .",
    "a break in the electron distribution was also used by li & chevalier ( 2001 ) to model the emission of 000301c in the framework of spherical ejecta interacting with a wind - like external medium , and by panaitescu & kumar ( 2001 ) for the afterglow of grb 991216 , where its was found that a jet model with a broken power - law injected electron distribution accommodates the data better than the simple jet model .",
    "although the optical light - curve breaks shown in figures 3 and 4 are mostly due to the @xmath27-passage , the collimation of ejecta is still present in the model , to obtain consistency between the hard electron index @xmath153 and the @xmath113 late radio decay .",
    "we find marginally acceptable fits only for a jet interacting with a homogeneous medium , and after excluding the 3.04.3 days data , as we could not model the brightening of 000301c during this time using microlensing . from the variation of @xmath145 around its minimum ,",
    "we arrive at the following 95% confidence level intervals for a single parameter : e_0 = ( 1.8 - 3.6 ) 10 ^ 50 , _ 0 = 10.8 - 14.6 ,",
    "n = 13 - 38 , = 0.032 - 0.15 , = 0.030 - 0.065 , p = 1.41 - 1.59 , = 0.34 - 0.54 , p = 0.9 - 1.3 . these results are given _ only _ to show the statistical uncertainties of the model parameters , and _ should not _ be considered absolute limits . for such limits",
    "one would need to know the  model error bars \" , which may be larger than the above uncertainties .",
    "consistency between the expected decay of jet light - curves and that seen in 000301c at 8.5 ghz after 30 days requires a hard electron distribution , with @xmath166 , similar to the indices obtained by malkov ( 1999 ) for fermi acceleration in the limit when particles acquire a significant fraction of the shock energy , and by ellison , jones , & reynolds ( 1990 ) and baring ( 2000 ) for particle diffusion driven by large angle scatterings .",
    "we note that the time when the afterglow steepening is seen constrains the @xmath27 break frequency and determines the electron fractional energy @xmath148 . in light of this , is interesting to note that for 000301c we find an electron fractional energy close to equipartition , providing thus a natural reason for steepening of the electron distribution at high energies .",
    "the model lensed light - curves we obtain show that microlensing by can yield a significant magnification but does not provide a good fit to the observations , failing to produce a peak at maximum lensing .",
    "the reason is that the afterglow surface brightness is not sufficiently concentrated toward the edge of the visible disk to yield a light - curve peak when this edge crosses the einstein disk of the lens .",
    "we emphasize that this conclusion is subject to the correctness of the assumptions made in our treatment of the jet model .",
    "evidently , we do not rule out microlensing of 000301c within the framework of other afterglow models ( non - uniform jets ) .",
    "an inhomogeneity in the external medium or a pile - up of electrons ( protheroe & stanev 1999 ) at the @xmath23 break , above which electrons are inefficiently accelerated , could in principle explain the brightening that preceded the steepening of the optical emission of 000301c .    baring , m. 2000 , 26th international cosmic ray conference , vol iv , p5 , eds .",
