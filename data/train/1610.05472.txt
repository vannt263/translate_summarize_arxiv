    "today s development cycles of electric machines , magnetic sensors , or transformers are intimately connected with numerical simulation .",
    "a cost - effective development and optimization of these devices is hardly viable without virtual prototyping .",
    "the fundamentals of electromagnetic simulations are the maxwell s equations and one of the most popular and most versatile numerical discretization schemes is the finite element method ( fem ) . while originally applied to problems in structural mechanics the fem succeeded also for electromagnetic problems for more than 30 years .",
    "however , the simplicity of the fem does not come for free .",
    "since electric and magnetic fields extend into the unbounded exterior air region one typically introduces homogeneous boundary conditions some distance away from the solid parts .",
    "then by expanding the finite element grid to parts of the air region an approximation for the unknown fields can be obtained .",
    "thanks to the decay properties of the electromagnetic fields this approach is widely applied , accepted , and justified for many applications .",
    "nevertheless , some problems remain :    * non - physical boundary conditions are imposed on the domain s ( fictitious ) boundary and the introduced modeling error leads to contaminated solutions .",
    "this might become critical when highly accurate simulation results are needed . *",
    "the meshing of the air region requires a considerable amount of time and effort . in many situations",
    "the number of elements in the air region even exceeds the number of elements used for the solid parts .",
    "* electrical devices often contain moving parts .",
    "for instance , the variation of the rotor / stator positions of an electric motor requires either a re - meshing of the air gap or a fundamental modification of the finite element scheme . *",
    "the accurate computation of electro - mechanical forces with a fem - only discretization remains a challenge .    in this work",
    "we are going to present the implementation of a fem - bem coupling scheme in which the air region is handled by the boundary element method ( bem ) while only the solid parts are discretized by the fem .",
    "the bem is a convenient tool to tackle unbounded exterior domains and it is well - designed to eliminate the above mentioned problems .",
    "the method is based on the discretization of boundary integral equations ( bies ) @xcite that are defined on the surface of the computational domain .",
    "hence , no meshing is required for the air region .",
    "further , the bies fulfill the decay and radiation conditions of the electromagnetic fields such that no additional modeling errors occur . and finally , a simple , automatic treatment of moving parts is intrinsic to the presented scheme .",
    "the force computation is beyond the scope of this paper but it is important to note that the bem computations provide us with additional information such that these calculations can be carried out with unparalleled accuracy .",
    "this work is organized as follows : section [ sec : mathematics ] recalls the main idea of the fem - bem coupling .",
    "the coupling relies mainly on the theoretical work presented in @xcite . for proper definitions of the mathematical spaces , their traces , and",
    "the occurring surface differential operators we refer to that publication and to the references cited therein . in section [ sec : numericalexamples ] the method itself and the presented preconditioning strategy are verified .",
    "additionally , applications to industrial models are presented , where we remark on the incorporation of periodic constraints .",
    "finally , this work closes with a conclusion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we summarize the fem - bem coupling scheme as it has been proposed in @xcite .",

    "however , in a coupled formulation the interior traces are expressed by their exterior counterparts via appropriate transmission conditions .",

    "the use of this special space is motivated by the fact that the potential in has no physical meaning within this physical context and , therefore , shall be removed from the final numerical scheme . because of @xmath45 the potential drops out naturally when the neumann trace is applied to .",

    "an enhancement based on auxiliary space methods has been developed in @xcite .",
    "it is denoted as _ auxiliary maxwell space _ preconditioner ( ams ) and appears to be the natural choice for magnetostatic and eddy - current problems .",

    "even @xmath123 millions of fem degrees of freedoms ( dofs ) for the finest grid on @xmath124 are outperformed by just 600 fem dofs that are used within the fem - bem scheme for the coarsest grid on @xmath18 .",
    "however , while the results from fig .",

    "both fields can be represented exactly by the used fe spaces . hence , the errors for the fem - bem formulation in fig .",
