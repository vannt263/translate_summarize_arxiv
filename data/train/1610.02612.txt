    "the phase space of a system with interacting degrees of freedom consists of all possible states of the system and grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "if the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium , then it obeys detailed balance , which means that the ensemble - averaged forward rate of transitioning between any two states is exactly balanced by the reverse rate , yielding zero net current between all states in the phase space .",
    "the probability , @xmath0 , of finding the system in state @xmath1 as opposed to state @xmath2 is determined by the boltzmann equation @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the free energy of state @xmath1 and @xmath5 is the inverse of the boltzmann constant times the temperature .",
    "eq.1 is powerful because it shows how the relative probability of any state ( a collective property over all the states ) is determined by its free energy ( a local property of the state ) at equilibrium .    at sub - cellular length scales , biological systems",
    "are composed of macromolecules such as proteins , and each state of the system is defined by specifying the relative abundances of all macromolecules relevant to the system as well as their conformational ( i.e. folding ) and chemical modification ( e.g. phosphorylation ) status .",
    "the energy to transition between states is typically comparable to thermal noise , and in the absence of net energy flow between the system and its environment , the system would attain a state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "yet most biological processes are not at equilibrium because energy is constantly being fed in to drive them , and as a result their microstate probabilities do not obey the boltzmann distribution .",
    "nevertheless , they do seem to occupy a small subset of functionally relevant states within their enormous phase space , and to transition between such states in a reproducible way .",
    "such a system can still reach a steady state that does not obey detailed balance , resulting in net fluxes between microstates capable of performing work and dissipating heat .",
    "a wide variety of microscopic life processes use the hydrolysis of atp into adp ( or gtp into gdp ) as an energy currency ; such processes are driven by the continual net recycling of spent adp back to atp .",
    "a theory , akin to the boltzmann distribution , is needed to relate nonequilibrium fluxes and probabilities to microscopic parameters such as energies and rate constants .",
    "these parameters can be changed via biochemical regulation or genomic mutation on the timescales of organisms and species , respectively .",
    "the lack of such a theory has limited our ability to answer fundamental questions about biology .",
    "such questions include : why are living systems generically so efficient at performing complex tasks despite thermal stochasticity , for example when transporting cargo , pumping ions or synthesizing proteins @xcite ? is it necessary for life to operate far from equilibrium ?",
    "how are biological systems simultaneously robust and complex ?",
    "are there simple effective variables that can be systematically tuned or is the irreducible set of variables generally very large ?",
    "are there invariant physical constraints on how systems must behave or evolve ?    to date ,",
    "the closest we ve come to answering such questions are for systems near , or tethered to , equilibrium conditions .",
    "these include the relationship between the work necessary to transition a system from one equilibrium state to another and the free energy difference between the two states @xcite , as well as the principle that systems behave in a way that extremizes entropy or path entropy when driven close to equilibrium ( such that the current has a linear response to the driving force ) @xcite .",
    "far from equilibrium , such variational principles are not sufficient for predicting system behavior in general @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation theorems , which are valid far from equilibrium , are not predictive without knowing the nonequilibrium microstate probabilities @xcite . a graph theory - based approach exists to compute these probabilities and fluxes at steady state@xcite . however , this method is a recipe of combinatorial graph calculations , in which the number of system - specific sub - graphs scales super - exponentially with the number of microstates @xcite .",
    "these restrictions limit the ability of this approach to establish general properties , and is computationally impractical .    here ,",
    "i show that there is a generalization of the boltzmann distribution , valid for all thermostatted systems , including those that are strongly driven as well as time - varying .",
    "the equation gives nonequilibrium probabilities and net fluxes as a function of equilibrium free energies and the rate constants of driven and undriven transitions .",
    "remarkably , this generalization is a mapping from the microstate network of a given nonequilibrium system to an electronic circuit whose nodes are the microstates and whose resistances and voltages correspond to the equilibrium and driven components of the system , respectively",
    ". the resistances in a network can be systematically coarse - grained into a few effective resistors , enabling exact coarse - graining of complex systems .",
    "new laws of nonequilibrium steady states , such as far - from - equilibrium reciprocal relations and upper bounds on efficiency , can be found which hold for any system driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium by an external energy source .",
    "the generalized boltzmann distribution shows how desired states can be amplified orders of magnitude beyond their equilibrium probabilities and how the state probabilities and currents depend on temperature , driving rate , and the free energy landscape of the non - driven system . for systems described by a cyclic microstate topology ,",
    "i explicitly show how they can convert local stability and control at equilibrium into global stability and control when driven far from equilibrium , thereby freeing systems to evolve functionality independent of stability optimization .",
    "many of these properties are shown to depend on being driven far from equilibrium .",
    "consider a system capable of existing in @xmath6 microstates ( fig .",
    "let the rate coefficients between the microstates be such that the system will reach thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "define two microstates @xmath7 and @xmath8 to be `` neighbors '' if there exists a pathway between them that does not traverse any other microstates .",
    "the system is then completely characterized by forward rate constants between neighboring states @xmath9 and free energies @xmath10 ; @xmath11 s will be referred to as `` equilibrium rate constants . ''",
    "any nonequilibrium system can be constructed by adding driven rate constants @xmath12 to the rate constants of an original equilibrium system .",
    "the net current , @xmath13 , from state @xmath7 to @xmath8 is @xmath14 , which is the sum of the forward and reverse rates . at equilibrium ,",
    "all @xmath12 are zero . in the case",
    "that some @xmath12 are nonzero , the system may reach a nonequilibrium steady state with , in general , non - zero currents .",
    "define a `` voltage '' source between neighboring states as : @xmath15 which is zero when the transition between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is not driven .",
    "define the resistance between any two neighbor states @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath16    [ h ]    2    note that the second equality in eq .",
    "3 follows because the equilibrium forward rate constant is equal to the equilibrium backward rate constant times the exponential of the free energy difference between the states ; hence the resistance is directionally symmetric .",
    "this symmetry is crucial for the mapping to a resistive circuit , and holds even when the network is being driven such that the directional symmetry of the currents ( i.e. detailed balance ) is broken .",
    "the generalized boltzmann equation for any states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are not necessarily neighbors , is obtained by summing all @xmath17 on any path between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , substituting eqs . 2 - 3 , and canceling terms : @xmath18 where the sum is over _ any _ path between states @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 denoting intermediate microstates on the path .",
    "eq . 4 generalizes",
    "the boltzmann distribution to driven and time - dependent systems .",
    "it is the principal result of this work , and the one from which all subsequent results are derived .",
    "the `` voltage potential '' at microstate @xmath1 is the ratio of the probability of state @xmath1 divided by its equilibrium probability : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the equilibrium probability of state @xmath1 and the partition function , respectively . as defined in eq .",
    "2 , this means that the voltage source , @xmath22 , is itself proportional to the voltage potential at @xmath7 , and is an example of a voltage - dependent voltage source .",
    "it is this feedback between the voltage and the voltage source that qualitatively differentiates linear near - equilibrium behavior from nonlinear far - from - equilibrium behavior .",
    "4 applied to any loop in phase space gives zero net change in voltage : @xmath23 , i.e. kirkhoff s `` loop rule . '' at steady - state , kirkoff s `` junction rule '' also applies : the sum of all net fluxes into each state is zero ( in electrical circuits , this criterion is true even when not at steady state due to zero net charge in any discrete circuit element ) . at steady state ,",
    "the number of equations necessary to solve is equal to the number of simple loops in the microstate network ( e.g. using the method of mesh currents ) plus the number of voltage sources ( which are voltage - dependent ) .",
    "the number of equations to solve could therefore be much fewer than the number of microstates of the system . furthermore , by the methods to combine resistors in parallel , in series , or via the star - mesh transform , the number of effective variables can be reduced without losing the explicit dependence on the elementary parameters ( fig.1b ) @xcite .    in the special case that there are no driven rates , @xmath24 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 , then @xmath25 everywhere at steady state .",
    "otherwise , the steady - state condition necessitates at least one closed loop with currents all flowing in the same direction , in violation of eq .",
    "4 applied to the closed loop . therefore ,",
    "if all driven rates are zero , eq .",
    "4 reduces to the boltzmann distribution eq . 1 .",
    "zia and schmittmann , drawing an analogy with electric circuits , postulated that the full characterization of nonequilibrium steady states required that the interstate currents be placed on equal footing with the probability distribution @xcite .",
    "4 shows that this analogy becomes an exact mapping when the voltage and resistance are defined as in eqs . 2 - 3 .",
    "in this mapping , equilibrium corresponds to the situation in which all microstates are equipotential .",
    "due to the absence of net current at equilibrium , the free energies , being conjugate to the probabilities , are the only important microstate parameters . out of equilibrium , the resistances , being conjugate to the currents ,",
    "are just as important as free energies .",
    "for any system driven by thermal stochasticity as well as biasing forces , eq .",
    "4 shows that the flow and distribution of probability in the system s state space behaves in the same way as the current and voltage distribution in an electrical circuit ; the nondriven and driven transitions correspond to `` passive '' resistors and `` active '' voltage sources .",
    "this mapping allows for the cross - application of general theorems from the field of circuits , many of which hold for arbitrarily complex circuits . here",
    ", two such theorems , tellegen s theorem and lorentz s reciprocity theorem , are used to derive new statistical mechanical relations that hold for any system driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium by a single source .",
    "it is useful to describe the energy dissipation of a given system in terms of the circuit formalism presented here . from the fluctuation theorem @xcite ,",
    "the entropy production rate of the system is : @xmath26}$ ] , with the logarithm of the ratio of forward and reverse rates termed the `` affinity '' @xcite .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath27 - \\ln[p_j / p_j^ * ] ) + \\sum_{ij } i_{ij } \\ln[1+\\alpha_{ij}/k_{ij}].$ ] at steady state , the currents obey kirchoff s current law , and the first summation is the product of the current and a scalar field .",
    "tellegen s theorem is therefore applicable , and states that the first summation is zero @xcite .",
    "the entropy production rate at steady state is thus : @xmath28},\\ ] ] which can be computed by measuring the currents of only the directly driven processes ( for which @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is thus categorically simpler than obtaining the currents and probabilities of all states in order to calculate the entropy production before tellegen s theorem is applied .",
    "consider a singly driven system , for which there is a single nonzero driven rate constant , denoted @xmath30 .",
    "if we define all other transitions as the `` load '' of the microstate network , then the entropy production of the load is equal to the total entropy production minus the entropy production of the driven transition .",
    "whether for engineered or evolved systems , the power source ( directly driven transitions ) are typically optimized separately from the load , allowing each to be independently improved and modularly combined . in the state space of nonequilibrium systems , the load comprises the set of states or transitions that are the ultimate goal of driving the system . in biology , the load could correspond to a particular cellular pattern , protein assembly , or directed movement , that is negligible at equilibrium . running current through the load",

    "the system is maintained at steady state by constant replacement of products with reactants at a rate @xmath72 that drives state 1 ( defined to be `` enzyme + free product '' ) to state 2 ( defined to be `` enzyme + free substrate '' ) . without the enzyme , the spontaneous interconversion rates between substrate and product are much smaller than the other rates .",

    "a ubiquitous biochemical process is the activation and inactivation of proteins via the chemical attachment and removal of a phosphate group to the protein .",
    "proteins are phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by kinases and phosphatases , respectively , which are themselves also proteins .",
    "about one third of all proteins are estimated to be turned on and off in this way , with mis - regulation of phosphorylation now recognized to be a fundamental mechanism in diseases such as cancer @xcite .",
    "a minimal model of such protein regulation is the 6-state phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle shown in fig .",
    "3b , which assumes that kinase and phosphatase concentrations are large compared with the regulated protein and thus unaffected by binding .",
    "there are two driven transitions , from state 2 to state 3 and from state 5 to state 6 , corresponding to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation , respectively ; both of these are driven by the binding and hydrolysis of atp , which is kept in extreme excess to its equilibrium concentration compared with adp ( see methods for details ) . as a specific instance , consider the regulation of the mapk protein which controls cell decision - making ( such as whether to divide ) and for which we can use existing estimates of microstate parameters @xcite .",

    "however , the occupancy of state 4 is weakly modified by changing the phosphatase concentration , which is the canonical way that mapk activity is controlled in vivo ( fig .",
    "4e ) . therefore , a single driving source can cause a functionally important state that is only locally stable at equilibrium to become globally stable , but lacks the ability to tune the stability via modulation of rate constants or energies as reflected in the resistances .      consider the biologically - relevant case in which both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are directly driven . since both driven rate constants are proportional to atp concentration , for simplicity , assume that @xmath78 .",

    "the switching off of the protein ( i.e. depleting the `` on '' state 4 ) can be accomplished by decreasing the phosphatase concentration , and is either dominated by the linear term ( non - cooperative ) or quadratic term ( cooperative ) in the denominator of eq .",

    "these resistors can be systematically coarse - grained into effective variables , enabling lossless simplification . out of equilibrium , when currents are nonzero , the concept of the resistance is equally as important as that of the energy .",
    "this mapping allows for the cross - application of general circuit theorems to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to yield the reciprocal and maximum efficiency relations , which hold for all systems driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium by an energy source .",
    "the nonequilibrium boltzmann equation and its associated formalism and theorems are well - suited to probe living systems , which consist of a sparse subset of transitions ( atp binding ) that are directly driven far from equilibrium , thereby breaking detailed balance for the entire interconnected phase space .",
    "the theory leads to testable predictions relating observables ( @xmath39 and @xmath0 ) to both macroscopic ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) and microscopic parameters ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) , which can be independently confirmed in calorimetry , time - resolved - spectroscopy , and/or mutagenesis experiments .",
    "this approach offers a concrete way to answer general questions about living systems , such as whether high efficiency is intrinsic or due to evolutionary fine - tuning , how cell fate can be shielded from some biochemical perturbations while being sensitive to others , and how complexity coexists with stability and tunability .",

    "for the 6-state ( de)phosporlyation model , atp hydrolysis - driven ( de)phosphorylation is lumped into the atp - binding step because the former occurs irreversibly and much faster than the latter step under physiological conditions .",

    "<S> this mapping allows for the application of powerful theorems from circuit theory to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , from which they take on new meaning , such as maximum efficiency and reciprocal relations arbitrarily far from equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> these relations are obeyed by driven steady state systems in general , and therefore govern biological performance , response , and evolvability . </S>",
    "<S> the resistors can be systematically coarse - grained to simplify the analysis of complex systems , as well as to deduce microscopic thermodynamic information like free energy barriers from measurements of macroscopic observables like dissipation rate or motility . as concrete examples </S>",
    "<S> , the single - cycle microstate topology with one and two driving sources , which describe protein catalysis and activation , respectively , are solved analytically . in these cases , being driven far from equilibrium allows function to be optimized independently of stability .    2 </S>"
