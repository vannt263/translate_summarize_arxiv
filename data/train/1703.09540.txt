    "we consider the well - known caldern s inverse boundary value problem , also known as electrical impedance tomography . given @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 , the so - called dirichlet - to - neumann map @xmath5 is the operator which associates to each @xmath6 the conormal derivative @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the weak solution to the dirichlet problem @xmath9 caldern s problem asks for the determination of @xmath10 , given @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we refer to uhlmann @xcite for a thorough review on the progress and on the state of the art for this problem .",
    "it is well - known that this problem is ill - posed @xcite and that , assuming a - priori regularity bounds of any order on @xmath10 , the best possible stability of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath11 is of logarithmic type , mandache @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for the latest result of stability under minimal a - priori assumptions in the two  dimensional case , and for an updated reference list .",
    "on the other hand , under minimal regularity assumptions , it is known that the boundary values of @xmath10 depend in a lipschitz fashion on @xmath11 , @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask how the determination of the values of @xmath10 does deteriorate the deeper we go inside the domain @xmath12 .    in this direction",
    "we mention the result of nagayasu , uhlmann and wang @xcite who consider two  valued conductivities of the form @xmath13 when @xmath14 and the domain @xmath15 is a small perturbation of a disk @xmath16 , @xmath17 . examining the linearization @xmath18 of the corresponding dirichlet - to - neumann map",
    ", they show that the dependence of the infinitesimal domain variation in terms of @xmath18 deteriorates when @xmath19 at a logarithmic rate .    also in this note",
    ", we shall treat the two - dimensional setting , but we shall consider more general perturbations of the homogeneous conductivity @xmath20 , and , rather than examining stability , we shall discuss a more crude notion of _",
    "let us briefly illustrate here our notion of resolution .",
    "given an error level @xmath21 on the dirichlet - to - neumann map , we shall say that two conductivities @xmath22 are _ indistinguishable _ if @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 denotes the appropriate @xmath25 norm .",
    "next , fixing a disk @xmath26 , we consider the class @xmath27 of conductivities which are perturbations of the reference homogeneous conductivity @xmath20 , and which may differ from @xmath28 only inside @xmath29 .",
    "we shall call _ resolution limit _ at level @xmath0 , for the point @xmath1 , the largest @xmath30 such that all conductivities in @xmath27 are indistinguishable .",
    "we recall that a related notion of _ distinguishability _ has been already introduced by isaacson and cheney in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this note is the explicit calculation of such a resolution limit for all @xmath31 in two specific geometrical settings .",
    "namely , when @xmath12 is the unit disk @xmath32 and when @xmath12 is the half plane @xmath33 .",
    "such explicit formulas illustrate that the resolution deteriorates as the distance from the boundary increases .",
    "our approach is based on few elementary facts .",
    "\\(i ) when @xmath34 the resolution limit for the center @xmath35 can be explicitly computed by separation of variables , @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the quadratic form @xmath36 where @xmath8 and @xmath37 are as in is invariant under conformal mappings .",
    "\\(iii ) the quadratic form @xmath38 above is monotone with respect to the conductivity @xmath10 .",
    "this is a well - known fact in the theory of eit and has been used in many instances in the past @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the explicit classical description in terms of mbius transformations of the automorphisms of the disk and of the conformal mappings of the half space onto the disk enable to reinterpret the formula for the resolution limit in each point in @xmath32 or in @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , we shall see that the case of the half plane is especially instructing , because in this case the resolution limit depends linearly on the depth .",
    "we wish to mention that , while this paper was in preparation , the authors became aware of the preprint by garde and knudsen @xcite where similar considerations are developed .",
    "it may be noticed , however that the present approach has some differences .",
    "\\i ) in @xcite only two - phase perturbations of the reference homogeneous conductivity are considered , whereas here we are able to treat any variable perturbation .",
    "\\ii ) in @xcite the error on the data is evaluated with respect to the @xmath39 norm , instead of the @xmath40 norm , as we do here .",
    "this last choice , besides being physically motivated , has the fundamental advantage of being conformally invariant .",
    "\\iii ) here we examine the case of the half plane , which may be especially suggestive in connection to geophysical applications .    in the next section 2",
    "we shall introduce the functional framework necessary for our analysis . the specific feature that we emphasize",
    "is that we are allowed to treat with equal simplicity bounded and unbounded simply connected domains in the plane .",
    "next we show the basic conformal invariance of the functional spaces just introduced and of the dirichlet - to - neumann map .",
    "finally we rigorously formulate the notions of indistinguishability and of resolution limit .    in section 3",
    "we compute the resolution limit .",
    "first we treat the case of the resolution limit at the center of the disk .",
    "next we compute the resolution limit at an arbitrary point in the disk .",
    "we examine the asymptotic behavior of the resolution limit with respect to the relevant parameters : depth , error level and ellipticity .",
    "we conclude with the formulas for the half plane .",
    "we shall use the standard identification of @xmath41 with @xmath42 . depending on the circumstances , points in the plane shall be represented by pairs @xmath43 of real numbers or by a single complex number @xmath44 .",
