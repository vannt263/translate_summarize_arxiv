    "recent experimental progress in atomic physics includes the success of magnetic microtraps @xcite  the so - called `` atom chips '' @xcite  where combinations of magnetic fields and wires layed on silica substrates have made possible atom traps , guides and devices all above a single chip @xcite .",
    "the strong magnetic field gradients created by microtraps have already proven their versatility .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have been created above microchip surfaces using evaporation @xcite and also by using the surface itself as a hot atom knife to condense a cloud of atoms @xcite .",
    "these achievements are significant since a bec is the most likely source to feed atom - optical devices as they provide a large number of coherent atoms .",
    "in fact , the controlled propagation of becs through atom chip waveguides has already been demonstrated @xcite , and some sources of decoherence have been identified @xcite .",
    "non - linear interactions in atom optics can be useful @xcite , but recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated that such effects can potentially degrade atom optical device performance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , despite the possibility of using multi - moded matter waves @xcite , the low - density regime with single - mode propagation is expected to make atom optical devices much simpler and easier to operate . with this in mind , previous theoretical investigations of the low - velocity , low - density matter wave limit have delineated the conditions for single - moded wave propagation through microstructures @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we further explore the conditions under which propagation is single - moded , and the extent to which classical mechanics can predict the transverse excitation .",
    "specifically , the time - dependent scattering of a wavepacket through a circular bend is investigated , neglecting atom - atom interactions .",
    "the curved waveguide is a fundamental system that forms the basis for many geometries already experimentally realised , such as multiple circular bends @xcite , storage rings @xcite , spiral guides @xcite and stadium shaped traps @xcite . note that these experiments all used atoms with relatively high energies , not ground mode atoms , and thus the atomic motion was modelled using monte carlo ensembles of classical particles @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent quantum mechanical calculations explore the low - energy , tight bend limit , as well as regimes not easily accessible with our previous time - independent calculations of the circular bend system @xcite : large radii bends and small de broglie wavelengths .",
    "classical particle calculations using ehrenfest s theorem are performed alongside such wavepacket calculations to highlight the connections between the two pictures of atom propagation : @xmath0 that is , the center - of - mass motion of a wavepacket can be approximated by a _",
    "single _ trajectory of a classical particle , which we call the ehrenfest trajectory . while ehrenfest s theorem is generally exact for simple harmonic oscillators ( shos ) , our bend is only an sho in the transverse direction .",
    "so , the question asked here is how well the approximation introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ehren ] ) reproduces the exact ehrenfest s theorem , and thus the quantum mechanical results .",
    "we are not , however , testing the use of monte carlo ensembles of classical particles to approximate the quantum observables .",
    "jskelinen and stenholm @xcite , for example , have explored such an approach and found excellent agreement for the `` transverse cooling '' of a wavepacket exiting an abruptly terminating transverse potential ( when quantum reflections do not play a role ) .    in our calculations",
    ", remarkable agreement is seen between the `` transverse heating '' for the quantum wavepacket and for its ehrenfest trajectory , when wavepacket properties such as dispersion can be neglected ( in accordance with our approximation to ehrenfest s theorem ) and where large quantum numbers are involved ( in accordance with bohr s correspondence principle ) .",
    "it will also be seen that the transverse heating of the ehrenfest trajectories and the wavepackets are in disagreement with analytic expressions obtained by blanchard and zozulya for high - velocity atoms and large radii bends @xcite .",
    "the present results provide guidance as to when matter wave propagation through microstructures can be reliably considered using classical particle motion .",
    "whilst there are a variety of atom chip wire configurations both proposed and experimentally proven @xcite , the same theoretical ansatz found in @xcite was adopted here . that is ,",
    "only multiple wire configurations that do not require external bias fields applied in the plane of the microchip surface are considered @xcite .",
    "the problems relating to majorana spin - flips during propagation in the zero - field region of such geometries are ignored here , although it is noted that luo _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a rotating potential scheme to avoid these losses .",
    "our model reduces exactly to a 2-d geometry without losing any physics , as the out - of - plane potential remains constant through the bend in the limit where atom - atom interactions are neglected ( in other words , the out - of - plane quantum number is conserved @xcite ) . in practice ,",

    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation has been solved for non - interacting , low - energy wavepackets propagating through circular bends .",
    "our main goal for the present time - dependent calculations was to understand the conditions under which the classical picture of atom propagation through microstructures is valid for predicting transverse excitation . to this end , a series of time - dependent quantum and ehrenfest trajectory calculations were performed and compared .    in the tight - bend limit , @xmath130 ,",
    "for @xmath48 there was good agreement between the transverse heating predicted by the wavepacket and the ehrenfest trajectory calculations .",
    "in contrast to the purely sho case , the path of the wavepacket averages @xmath76,@xmath77 through the bend were found to be completely different from the ehrenfest trajectory for small @xmath2 .",
    "the peak probability density of the wavepacket , however , wriggles out of the bend along the same path as the ehrenfest trajectory .",
    "bohr s correspondence principle is demonstrated in the tight - bend , high propagation velocity limit ( where high-@xmath131 modes can be excited ) where great agreement is seen between the transverse heating of the wavepacket and its ehrenfest trajectory .",
    "the agreement for larger @xmath2 was not as good due to the increasingly important effects of wavepacket dispersion .",
    "in general , as long as the propagation velocity is such that there are minimal wave effects ( such as reflection and dispersion ) the approximation to ehrenfest s theorem introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ehren ] ) provides a useful approximation to the exact ehrenfest s theorem and thus the quantum mechanics .",
    "a note of caution should be added when extending this idea to other microstructures .",
    "for example , a wavepacket exiting an abruptly terminating transverse potential can transfer transverse energy into longitudinal energy , leading to transverse cooling @xcite . in that particular study , an ensemble of classical particles",
    "was found to reproduce the wavepacket expectation values ( given situations where quantum reflections did not play a role ) .",
    "the ehrenfest trajectory through such a potential , however , would be completely unaffected by the changes in the transverse potentials .    as the temperature of the atoms used in atom chip experiments decreases , the modelling of experiments using monte - carlo simulations will increasingly need to take into account the wave nature of the atoms .",
    "the present calculations provide guidance as to when this can simply be achieved by using a single classical trajectory to calculate the quantum observables of waves propagating through simple microstructures .",

    "most implementations of finite differences for the schrdinger equation implicitly require a volume element that is constant over the whole space .",
    "this condition is trivially satisfied for cartesian coordinates and can usually be achieved through a rescaling of the wave function for other coordinate systems .",
    "spherical coordinates are a prime example of the latter case since the radial wave function is often scaled by a factor of @xmath132 to remove the first derivative from the kinetic energy , effectively putting the system into a cartesian coordinate system with a boundary condition .    another common coordinate system , cylindrical coordinates ,",
    "is not so easily handled  rescaling the wave function involves a factor of @xmath133 .",
    "the overall behavior of the wave function near @xmath134=0 is then non - analytic , making finite differencing invalid since differencing relies on taylor series expansions .",
    "further , straightforward differencing of the unscaled @xmath134 equation gives a non - hermitian operator , which is a situation to be avoided in general .",
    "the angular momentum operator in spherical coordinates suffers from similar problems upon rescaling . somewhat _ ad hoc _ schemes have been formulated to deal with these problems , but are less than satisfactory from the viewpoint of wanting a general differencing scheme applicable to arbitrary coordinate systems .",

    "we begin with the energy functional @xmath135 note that in writing the kinetic energy as we have will guarantee that our resulting difference representation is hermitian .",

    "this condition requires that @xmath147 be subtracted from the first diagonal element of @xmath148 ; a similar term should be subtracted from the last element to apply the boundary condition at the other boundary .",
    "the case in which no boundary condition is required  if @xmath134=0  is treated the same as the zero derivative boundary condition . in all cases , the values of @xmath149 outside of the grid should be chosen to be symmetric with respect to the boundary .",

    "both the time and spatial dependence of the expectation values is not so simple and is worth this brief appendix .    in our analysis ,",
    "the transverse heating played the critical role in our comparisons between the quantal and classical results .",
    "the transverse heating is simply the energy transferred from the wavepackets longitudinal kinetic energy into transverse energy .",
    "quantum mechanically , of course , we must take the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "one might be tempted to use the virial theorem to more simply calculate this using twice the expectation value of the potential energy , however , it is well known @xcite that the virial theorem only strictly holds for stationary states .    it turns out that for a simple harmonic oscillator in one dimension that the expectation value of the kinetic energy for an arbitrary state is @xmath167 \\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 are the expansion coefficients of @xmath169 on the sho eigenstates @xmath170 .",
    "the expectation value of kinetic energy thus oscillates about half the average total energy . upon time - averaging ,",

    "since only the time - average will usually be important , this result can be handy for numerical calculations . note that if only states with opposite parity or indices separated by more than two are populated",

    "it is convenient to write the wave function as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the transverse sho wave function .",

    " and there is no mechanism for mode conversion  the observables will become time - independent as expected .",
    "we can also use these ideas to interpret the wave function at a fixed time by only integrating over @xmath19 .",
    "the transverse position at a given time @xmath176 is then @xmath177 as a function of @xmath178 .",

    "this time - independent expression can be used , for instance , to understand the wriggles seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : projcompilev03000 ] as the wavepacket exits the circular bend .",
    "where two modes overlap , the position of the resulting @xmath183 wriggles will be independent of time as the wavepacket propagates ( like a snake threading its body through a single curved path ) .",
