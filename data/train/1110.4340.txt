    "quantum entanglement  @xcite is a quantum mechanical phenomenon created by the separation of interacting quantum particles .",
    "this fundamental concept underpins a wide range of research in physics , such as quantum information , quantum computing , and quantum gravity , etc .",
    "when one considers this phenomenon in a study , it is often quantified as an _",
    "entanglement entropy_. in the field of condensed - matter physics , the von neumann entanglement entropy has been frequently used as an order parameter to investigate quantum phase transition or topological order in the quantum many - body problems . in particular , for one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems the entropy can be directly related to the _ central charge _ of the conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "@xcite to date , a method with this relation has been developed as a powerful tool to study the universal properties of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid  @xcite , in combined with numerical methods such as exact diagonalization ( ed ) or density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite techniques .",
    "let us consider a quantum 1d periodic system with length @xmath0 .",
    "the von neumann entanglement entropy of its subsystem with length @xmath1 is given as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem and @xmath4 is the full density matrix of the whole system .",
    "using the cft , the entropy of the subsystem with length @xmath1 for a fixed system length @xmath0 has been derived :  @xcite @xmath5+s_1 \\label{entropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the central charge of the associated cft and @xmath7 is a non - universal constant . a prime objective of using this formula is to estimate the central charge ,  @xcite which provides definitive information concerning the universality class of @xmath8 dimensional system .",
    "@xcite this estimation has been applied to a variety of fermionic systems ; e.g. , with impurity  @xcite , coupled to bosons ,  @xcite and under the magnetic field ,  @xcite etc .",
    "although the central charge can be also obtained by examining the finite - size correction of ground - state energy or the low - temperature behavior of specific heat ,  @xcite excited states have to be taken into account and considerable difficulty is involved in the ed and dmrg calculations .",
    "but , if one uses eq.([entropy ] ) , it is only necessary to consider the ground state .",
    "so far , two kinds of numerical methods have been principally adopted to extract the value of @xmath6 from eq.([entropy ] ) : one is direct fitting of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath1 for a fixed system length and the other is scaling analysis using a relation @xmath10 , considering two systems with lengths @xmath0 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , one would encounter difficulty attributable to a finite - size effect in their practical use . more specifically , in the former method the equation ( [ entropy ] ) is exact only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath12 and some ambiguity remains in the fitting of finite - size result ;  @xcite whereas , in the latter method the system length to be studied must be strongly restricted due to the incommensurability ( or frustration ) of spin and/or charge fluctuations as well as the ( open-)shell problem in itinerant systems . therefore , the aim of this paper is to propose a new method that overcomes those problems .",
    "we first derive an efficient formula for calculating the central charge .",
    "and then , to ascertain the validity of the formula we apply it to a couple of 1d quantum systems ; ( i ) frustrated spin model and ( ii ) itinerant model with strong charge fluctuation .",
    "we demonstrate that a very accurate estimation of critical point between tl - liquid and gapped ( or ordered ) states is enabled with this method .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that the tl parameter can be calculated in a like manner as the central charge .",
    "let us now derive the formula for estimating the central charge .",
    "we first prepare @xmath13 and @xmath14 from eq.([entropy ] ) .",
    "then , by subtracting the one from the other a simple expression is obtained : @xmath15 } { \\ln\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{l}\\right)\\right ] } \\equiv c_1 . \\label{cc1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this expression we can easily calculate the central charge for a 1d system with a fixed system length .",
    "the main advantages of eq.([cc1 ] ) are ; ( i ) the non - universal constant @xmath7 does not appear explicitly , ( ii ) only two values of @xmath9 at the middle of system , where the finite - size correction to eq.([entropy ] ) is the smallest  @xcite and the dmrg calculation is the most accurate , are used , and ( iii ) a unique value of @xmath6 is estimated for each system length and it enables us to perform a systematic extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . also , an alternative expression can be derived from the second derivative of eq.([entropy ] ) with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath9 is symmetric about @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , we obtain @xmath18 \\equiv c_2 . \\label{cc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that eq.([cc2 ] ) can be also derived by applying @xmath19\\simeq-\\frac{\\pi^2}{2l^2}$ ] into eq.([cc1 ] ) .",
    ".system - size dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath21 obtained from eqs.([cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) for the 1d @xmath22 frustrated heisenberg model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ krho ]     as a function of @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the system lengths are taken at intervals of @xmath25 sites from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "the red dashed line shows a simple linear fitting .",
    "inset : finite - size - scaling analysis of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the blue and green dashed lines are fitting with function @xmath32 .",
    "through all the calculations @xmath33 is kept to be odd , and therefore , @xmath34 ( see text ) . ]",
    "lastly , we mention that the tl parameter @xmath35 , which is one of the most notable quantity to study the tl - liquid properties , can be estimated in a manner similar to above .",
    "the tl parameter is related to the charge - density fluctuation of subsystem with length @xmath1 , @xmath36 [ @xmath37 subsystem ] , like  @xcite @xmath38-\\frac{(-1)^la}{\\left[\\frac{l}{\\pi}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi l}{l}\\right)\\right]^{2k_\\rho}}+f_1 , \\label{fluctuation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are non - universal constants .",
    "the function @xmath41 behaves similarly to @xmath9 with @xmath1 .",
    "then , in the same way as eq.([cc1 ] ) is derived , we easily obtain for @xmath42 @xmath43 \\\\ & & = \\frac{\\pi^2\\left[f_l\\left(\\frac{l}{2}-2\\right)-f_l\\left(\\frac{l}{2}\\right)\\right ] } { \\ln\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{l}\\right)\\right ] } \\equiv k_\\rho(l ) .",
    "\\label{krhol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the @xmath44 correction in eq.([fluctuation ] ) oscillates on alternate sites , the set of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a more proper choice than that of @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath28 estimated from eq.([krhol ] ) at @xmath48 as well as near the critical point are shown in table  [ krho ] . with increasing @xmath0",
    ", @xmath28 seems to approach the exact value @xmath49}. \\label{krhoexact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can easily perform the finite - size - scaling analysis with a fitting function @xmath32 ( @xmath50 ) where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fitting parameters . from eq.([krhol ] ) , we know @xmath53 ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath54even ( odd ) and expect a simple relation @xmath55 if the logarithmic corrections are small .",
    "the fitting analyses are shown in fig .",
    "as expected , @xmath56 is obtained at @xmath24 . near the critical point , we have @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and they have a kind of deviation from the exact values of @xmath35 due to the existence of logarithmic corrections . nonetheless , the extrapolated values are reasonably close to the exact ones ( see table  [ krho ] ) .",
    "the remaining error in the thermodynamic limit is only about @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .    here , we briefly comment on applying the open boundary conditions ( obc ) . thus far",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are assumed ; however , in general the obc are more preferable in the dmrg study for accurate and convenient calculations . in this regard , with applying the obc the function @xmath9 oscillates like eq.([fluctuation ] ) due to the friedel oscillation and the analysis with eq.([cc1 ] ) is unreasonable . if one can suppress the friedel oscillation sufficiently at the center of the system , for example , by using the @xmath61-deformed obc technique ,  @xcite the central charge might be calculated by taking @xmath62 and @xmath63 as eq.([krhol ] ) even with the obc .",

    "this approach is applied to the frustrated spin chain and the half - filled spinless fermions with nearest - neighbor repulsion to check the validity .",
