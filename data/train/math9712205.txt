    "an elementary count of degrees of freedom suggests that a randomly - chosen curve in @xmath0 , if sufficiently complicated , should contain four collinear points .",
    "one precise interpretation of this intuition is the following two theorems :    every non - trivial piecewise linear or smooth knot in @xmath0 in general position has four collinear points .    if two smooth or pl circles @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath0 in general position have a non - zero linking number , then there is a line in @xmath0 which intersects @xmath1 , then @xmath2 , then @xmath1 again , and then @xmath2 again .    these theorems are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( they are also mentioned in @xcite . ) also , the arguments in @xcite yield a lower bound on the number of collinearities and a generalization of the second theorem to the case of two circles which are linked in the sense that each represents a non - trivial homotopy class in the complement of the other .",
    "the main theorem of the present paper is a different generalization of this result :    every non - trivial tame link in @xmath0 has four collinear points .",
    "[ goal ]    since the statement of the theorem resembles the statements of theorems of pannwitz , morton , and mond , we explain the extra cases covered by our theorem . by a _ non - trivial link _ we mean any set of disjoint circles embedded in @xmath0 such that there is no homeomorphism of @xmath0 which sends the circles to a flat plane . the whitehead link and",
    "the borromean rings are two examples of non - trivial links which are not covered by the previous theorems .",
    "tame link _ is any set of continuous circles which are collared by solid tori , or equivalently one which is topologically equivalent to a smooth link in @xmath0 .",
    "however , a tame link may be very different from a smooth link geometrically ; for example , its hausdorff dimension may be greater than 1 .",
    "moreover , the main theorem is not restricted to links which have any particular transversality properties or are in general position in any sense .    to eliminate the general position hypothesis , we first prove a stronger theorem about ( smooth ) links in general position : such a link has a line which intersects it four times in a topologically non - trivial way .",
    "armed with this extra condition , we can use a limiting argument to pass from links in general position to arbitrary tame links .",
    "the theorem has an interesting corollary which may be applied to the topology of real algebraic surfaces .",
    "it is this application which led the author to the topic of this paper .    if an algebraic surface in @xmath0 contains the boundary of a knotted solid torus or linked solid tori , the surface has degree at least 8 .",

    "to be precise , a quadrisecant is a pair of distinct trisecants with the same underlying line segment .",
    "a _ degenerate secant _ is a single point .",
    "the set of secants has a natural topology , as does the set of trisecants : for a sequence of trisecants to converge we insist that the middle points converge as well .",
    "as motivation for the main theorem , we present a simple proof of a weaker result :    every non - trivial smooth knot @xmath5 in @xmath0 has a trisecant .",
    "suppose that there exists a point @xmath4 in @xmath5 such that no points @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath5 are collinear with @xmath4 .",

    "we define the _ algebraic dimension _ of a subset @xmath32 of a vector space @xmath33 to be the krull dimension of the ring of polynomial functions restricted to @xmath32 .",

    "we will need two basic facts about algebraic dimension : the algebraic dimension image of a set @xmath32 under a projection ( or more generally a polynomial map ) is less than or equal to the algebraic dimension of @xmath32 , and the complement of a set of algebraic codimension 1 or more is a polynomial property . in the following discussion",
    "we will also use codimension to mean the difference of the dimension of a pair of sets .    for simplicity , we consider only the case of knots .",
    "observe that in the vector space of ordered quadruples of points in @xmath0 , the subset for which the four points are collinear has algebraic codimension 4 . given four points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 on the unit circle , the space of knots @xmath5 of degree @xmath13 ( for @xmath35 ) projects onto the space of quadruples of points in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the set of knots @xmath5 of degree @xmath13 for which @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are collinear has codimension 4 as well , as does the analogous set in the space of quintuples @xmath40 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 are four distinct points on the circle . by projection ,",

    "is polynomial , i.e. finite .",
    "such a @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 would have to exist in order for @xmath30 to be three - to - one .",
    "thus , part iii of the lemma is proved for knots .",
    "the rest of the lemma can proved in the same fashion , namely by keeping track of the codimension of certain sets .",
    "informally , a set of algebraic codimension @xmath42 can be called an @xmath42-fold coincidence .",
    "parts i and ii of the lemma hold because , given points @xmath28 and @xmath29 on a link @xmath3 , it would take a 2-fold coincidence for the tangent to @xmath3 at @xmath29 to contain @xmath28 , and allowing @xmath28 to vary , it would take a 1-fold coincidence in the choice of @xmath28 , or allowing @xmath28 to vary , a 1-fold coincidence for the choice of @xmath29 .",
    "part iv of the lemma holds because , given @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath34 on a link @xmath3 , it would take a 3-fold coincidence for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath34 to be collinear and for the tangent lines at @xmath29 and @xmath34 to be coplanar .",
    "for part v , the case when condition iv of the lemma fails typifies the method of proof .",
    "informally , at a special point @xmath28 for which @xmath30 is somewhere three - to-1 , three arms of the projection of the link meet at a point and it would take a coincidence for there to be a fourth arm at the point or for two of the arms to have the same slope . near @xmath28 the front two arms cross at a point and it would take a coincidence for that crossing to travel parallel to the third arm instead of passing through it .    geometrically , it would take a 6-fold coincidence for five given points on a link @xmath3 to be collinear , and it would take a 5-fold coincidence for four given points on @xmath3 to be collinear and for two of the tangent lines to be coplanar .",
    "so in either case it would take a 1-fold coincidence in the choice of @xmath3 for such a set of points to exist .",
    "finally , consider collinear four points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 on @xmath3 and let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 be the tangent lines at these points .",
    "the set of lines that intersect @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 sweeps out a surface , and it is a 1-fold coincidence in the choice of @xmath46 for it to be tangent to that surface . if it is not tangent , then @xmath30 will look as it does in case iv of figure  [ f : one ] .",
    "the arguments in this section follow that of @xcite and @xcite . the only new feature is the notion of topological non - trivial quadrisecants , which we will need to generalize the main theorem to arbitrary knots .",
    "we begin with a simple lemma and a definition :    let @xmath47 be a compact set in @xmath48 . then not every point of @xmath47 lies between two other points of @xmath47 .

    "the disk may intersect itself and the secant . a quadrisecant @xmath50 with middle points @xmath29 and @xmath34 is topologically trivial if any of the secants @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are .",

    "if @xmath29 is a generic point , the topology of @xmath59 , and therefore the topology of @xmath60 , can not change as we vary @xmath28 slightly .",
    "but if @xmath28 is a special point , the topology of @xmath60 changes as illustrated in figure  [ f : two](b ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath28 is a special point at which condition iv of lemma  [ moves ] for @xmath59 fails , then there exist three points @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 so that @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath13 , in that order , make a quadrisecant of @xmath5 .",

    "choose the sequence so that @xmath129 converges smoothly to @xmath125 , i.e. @xmath130 converges smoothly to the zero section . since @xmath105 is a diffeomorphism outside of @xmath3 , we may choose each @xmath128 to be a polynomial link in general position .    by hypothesis , each @xmath128 has the same isotopy type as @xmath3 , and in particular each @xmath128 is non - trivial .",
    "therefore each @xmath128 has a topologically non - trivial quadrisecant @xmath131 . by compactness",

    "the resulting limit is a secant of @xmath3 .",

    "let @xmath2 be a round , open ball in @xmath126 centered at @xmath135 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath133 such that @xmath134 and an arc @xmath1 of @xmath128 with the same endpoints as @xmath134 are both contained in @xmath136 . for each point @xmath137",
    ", we consider the line segment from @xmath138 to @xmath139 , where @xmath139 is the point in @xmath130 which lies in the same fiber of @xmath126 as @xmath138 , as illustrated in figure  [ f : four ] .",
    "since @xmath130 is a section , @xmath139 is unique .",
    "the union of these line segments is the image of a spanning disk of @xmath140 which does not intersect @xmath141 . therefore @xmath134 is topologically trivial , a contradiction .",
    "the proof that the limit of the @xmath134 s is not a subset of @xmath3 is similar .",
    "corollary  [ degree8 ] follows from this theorem :    let @xmath142 be a non - trivially linked collection of solid tori . for each @xmath133 and each @xmath143 , let @xmath144 be the shortest non - contractible loop in @xmath108 which is homotopically @xmath42 times the core of @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath145 be a shortest member of the set @xmath146 .",
    "if we let @xmath61 and @xmath147 be two disjoint , non - separating disks in @xmath108 for some @xmath133 , then we see that the length of @xmath144 is bounded below by @xmath42 times the distance between @xmath61 and @xmath147 .",
    "therefore @xmath145 exists , although it may not be unique .",
    "suppose that for some @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "then we can divide @xmath145 into two loops from @xmath150 to itself .",
    "at least one of these loops must be non - contractible and both loops are shorter , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus , each @xmath145 is an embedding .",
    "if we let @xmath3 be the union of the images of the @xmath145 s , then @xmath3 is a satellite link of the @xmath108 s . by a theorem in knot theory @xcite",
    ", @xmath3 must be a non - trivial link if the @xmath108 s are .",
    "since a geodesic in a smooth manifold with smooth boundary must be @xmath151 ( see @xcite ; a proof was also suggested to the author by tom ilmanen ) , @xmath3 must be a tame link . by the preceding theorem",
    ", @xmath3 must have a quadrisecant @xmath73 such that no component secant of @xmath73 is contained in @xmath3 .",
    "suppose that a component secant @xmath32 of @xmath73 were contained entirely inside some @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a path which goes from one endpoint of @xmath32 to the other .",
    "then we can divide @xmath145 into two paths @xmath152 and @xmath153 to make two loops @xmath154 and @xmath155 whose composition is homotopic to @xmath145 .",
    "at least one of these loops must be non - contractible , therefore they can not both be shorter .",
    "therefore each component secant of @xmath73 must have one point which lies outside the @xmath108 s .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath156 is a non - trivial polynomial whose zero set contains @xmath157 for all @xmath133 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath10 to the line containing @xmath73 must be non - trivial and must have at least 8 real roots , counting multiplicity .",
    "therefore @xmath10 has degree at least 8 .",
    "the author once believed that the loop in a solid torus which is the shortest non - zero multiple of the core is necessarily homotopic to the core .",
    "however , this is false by an example of doug jungreis .",
    "we can consider the region @xmath32 in @xmath0 which consists of the set of points @xmath158 such that : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is very large , @xmath161 is much larger still , and @xmath162 is much smaller than @xmath163 .",
    "the region @xmath32 could be described as a corrugated sheet , and it has the property that if @xmath164 and the straight - line distance from @xmath28 to @xmath29 is greater than 1 , then this distance is much less than the length of the shortest path in @xmath32 from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath54 is a smooth mbius strip in @xmath0 whose tangent plane varies slowly , we can approximate @xmath54 with a solid torus @xmath70 which is topologically a tubular neighborhood of @xmath54 but which is geometrically quite different : @xmath70 is the union of a thick tube centered around the boundary of @xmath54 and a corrugated sheet which approximates the interior of @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ f : five ] .",
    "clearly the shortest non - trivial loop in @xmath70 stays close to the boundary of @xmath54 and is therefore homotopically twice the core .",
    "it is easy to show that the bound in corollary  [ degree8 ] is the best possible : if we choose two numbers @xmath165 , then the surface given by : @xmath166 is a torus .",
    "if @xmath167 , we can multiply two such surfaces together to obtain two linked tori .",
    "the most serious shortcoming of corollary  [ degree8 ] is the fact that it only applies to closed surfaces in @xmath0 , while the usual context for studying degrees of real algebraic surfaces is @xmath168 .",
    "we may view a subset of @xmath0 as a subset of @xmath168 which is disjoint from the `` plane at infinity '' , which is a copy of @xmath169 .",
    "we may define a _ flat _",
    "plane in @xmath168 to be the image of the plane at infinity under a projective transformation of @xmath168 , and a _ topological _ plane to be the image of the plane at infinity under a homeomorphism of @xmath168 .",
