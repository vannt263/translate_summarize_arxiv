    "now consider @xmath531 , where @xmath532 and @xmath359 stays in @xmath2 , and let @xmath422 . again if @xmath522 stays in @xmath2 then @xmath533 . if @xmath522 does not stay in @xmath2 then @xmath534 , so @xmath535 .",
    "it remains to check that if @xmath536 for @xmath537 then @xmath538 . if @xmath539 then this is immediate , so we suppose @xmath540 .",
    "this means we must in fact have @xmath541 while @xmath542 is not in @xmath2 and hence @xmath543 is also not in @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath544 is a relation not staying in @xmath2 and therefore @xmath545 . as before @xmath546",
    "so @xmath547 as required .    as the subspace @xmath469 is invariant it carries a unitary representation of @xmath5 defined by @xmath548 where @xmath359 is any word with @xmath549 :",
    "this is well - defined as for every relation @xmath550 , the operator @xmath500 is the identity on @xmath469 . for @xmath537 define @xmath551 .",
    "then for each @xmath335 , right multiplication by @xmath542 induces an isomorphism from @xmath552 to @xmath553 .",
    "this yields an isomorphism @xmath554 defined by @xmath555 .",
    "it is easy to check that this preserves inner products since the representation is unitary and the subspaces @xmath553 are pairwise orthogonal . for @xmath454 ,",
    "the isomorphism identifies @xmath455 with @xmath556 and hence the unitary representation of @xmath5 on @xmath469 extends to a representation of @xmath24 .",
    "composing with the quotient map @xmath557 we obtain a representation of @xmath15 on @xmath469 extending the map @xmath558 .",
    "we now consider @xmath472 .",
    "we have an isomorphism @xmath559 defined by @xmath560 where @xmath359 is a word staying in @xmath2 with @xmath561 : as we have seen above @xmath481 does not depend on the choice of @xmath359 .",

    "thus we see that the operator @xmath575 on @xmath472 is identified with @xmath576 on @xmath559 . using the isomorphism of hilbert modules to transfer the representation @xmath474 of @xmath15 on @xmath577 to @xmath472 yields a representation of @xmath15 on @xmath472 extending the map @xmath558 .",

    "the purpose of this section is to compute the @xmath1-theory of the algebra @xmath15 in this case .",
    "specifically we will show that @xmath580 hence there is a 6-term exact sequence in @xmath1-theory computing @xmath581 in terms of @xmath582 and @xmath583 .",

    "in fact the representation has range in @xmath15 , specifically , @xmath586 .",
    "hence we can think of @xmath584 as giving a representation on @xmath44 .",
    "likewise , as noted in section [ sub : bass - serre ] , the subset @xmath343 is right-@xmath64-invariant so there is a representation of @xmath587 on @xmath588 .",
    "extending by @xmath589 on @xmath248 we view this as a non - unital representation @xmath590 of @xmath587 on @xmath8 , defined by @xmath591 for @xmath592 .",

    "we remark that for @xmath136 the images @xmath601 and @xmath602 are not equal : specifically we have @xmath603 .",

    "similarly @xmath606 .    the algebra @xmath15 is generated by the images of the two representations @xmath599 .",
    "to see this it suffices to check that for @xmath509 a reduced word we have the equality @xmath607 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the boundary of the subset @xmath313 of @xmath65 is a single edge , hence a reduced word can not cross out of @xmath2 and back in again .",

    "\\(3 ) if @xmath359 is a relation not staying in @xmath2 then @xmath359 is a word of the form @xmath1107 or @xmath1108 where @xmath368 .",
    "taking the adjoint of equation [ kt = th ] and tensoring with @xmath251 we have @xmath1109 , so using the fact that @xmath1110 is unitary we get @xmath1111 the product @xmath1112 is the projection onto the complement of the submodule generated by @xmath1113 , so @xmath1114 is @xmath505 where @xmath170 is the projection onto the submodule generated by @xmath1115 .",
    "similarly tensoring equation",
    "[ kt = th ] with @xmath251 we have @xmath1116 so again the relation gives us @xmath505 .",
    "\\(4 ) since @xmath1117 for all @xmath136 and @xmath368 , we have @xmath1118 . thus we see that @xmath505 is unchanged by conjugating by @xmath1119 for @xmath136 .",
    "taking @xmath462 to be the restriction of @xmath1120 to @xmath460 we thus have that @xmath462 commutes with @xmath170 .    thus by proposition [ representations ] it follows that @xmath951 extends to a representation of @xmath15 on @xmath449 .",
    "faithfulness of the representation of @xmath15 on @xmath44 ensures that this extension is given by tensoring an extension of @xmath880 by @xmath251 , and in particular that @xmath880 extends to a representation of @xmath15 on @xmath1121 .",
    "it remains to check that @xmath881 defines a quasi - homomorphism for all @xmath882 , and hence that the quasi - homomorphisms @xmath883 and @xmath628 agree on @xmath1-theory .",
    "it is sufficient to check that @xmath953 is a compact operator for the generators @xmath954 and @xmath1122 of @xmath15 : given this , @xmath956 is compact as required .",
    "since @xmath1123 are compact perturbations of the identity , the same holds for @xmath1124 for all @xmath882 , so @xmath1102 agrees with @xmath1125 modulo compact operators , while for @xmath903 we have @xmath1126 by definition .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let @xmath5 be any infinite discrete group .",
    "we will say that a subspace @xmath27 of @xmath5 is _ universal _ if for every @xmath99 and every subset @xmath85 of @xmath98 there exists @xmath1127 such that @xmath1128 .",
    "intuitively this means that for any subspace @xmath2 of @xmath5 we can find arbitrarily large pieces of @xmath27 that look like @xmath2 .    as the condition holds for every subset of @xmath98 , in particular it holds for the ball ,",
    "so a universal space is deep .",
    "it is easy to see that universal spaces exist .",
    "for example for @xmath1129 we can construct a universal space by enumerating all binary sequences @xmath1130 , concatenating them as @xmath1131 and taking the subset of @xmath1132 whose characteristic function is this binary sequence .          let @xmath133 be a finite linear combination @xmath1138 with non - zero coefficients .",
    "then clearly for each @xmath17 the sum @xmath1139 is zero , so without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath1140 for all @xmath1141 .",
    "choose an @xmath1141 such that @xmath1142 is minimal with respect to inclusion , and take @xmath99 sufficiently large that every @xmath1143 lies in @xmath98 . by the universal hypothesis",
    "there is an @xmath1127 such that @xmath1144 . then @xmath1145 . as @xmath1142 is minimal",
    ", for each @xmath1146 there is some @xmath1147 , so @xmath1148 is not in @xmath27 , and @xmath1149 .",
    "it follows that @xmath1150 .",
    "hence no such @xmath133 is zero , and we conclude that the operators @xmath1134 are linearly independent .",
    "now let @xmath2 be any subspace of @xmath5 .",
    "we can define a map @xmath884 from the dense subalgebra of @xmath1151 spanned by operators @xmath1134 to the dense subalgebra of @xmath1152 spanned by operators @xmath89 as follows .",
    "we define @xmath1153 ; this is well defined as if @xmath1135 then @xmath1154 so @xmath1155 .",
    "moreover as the operators @xmath1134 are linearly independent we can extend by linearity to the whole dense subalgebra .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath884 is a homomorphism of @xmath67-algebras .        given the above remarks , it suffices to show that the map on dense subalgebras is contractive .",
    "let @xmath1158 be a finite sum @xmath1159 and let @xmath1160 .",
    "for any @xmath1161 there exists a finitely supported vector @xmath1162 of norm @xmath251 , such that @xmath1163 .",
    "take @xmath99 sufficiently large that @xmath98 contains @xmath1164 for all @xmath1165 . by the universal property there",
    "exists @xmath1127 such that @xmath1166 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath1167 we have @xmath1168 if and only if @xmath1169 .",
    "thus for @xmath1170 , the vector @xmath1171 is the left translation by @xmath151 of @xmath1172 .",
    "in particular @xmath1173 , hence @xmath1174 as required .",
    "[ example_coseparability ] let @xmath1178 be the free group with generators @xmath1179 .",
    "let @xmath662 be a universal subspace for @xmath5 chosen to be in the set of reduced words beginning with @xmath275 .",
    "now take @xmath1180 and take @xmath2 be the subset of @xmath27 given by @xmath1181 .",
    "then @xmath2 is relatively deep in @xmath27 , hence we have an exact sequence @xmath1182 moreover , the pair @xmath2 and @xmath27 satisfies the first condition of definition [ relative - h - almost - invariant ] because @xmath2 is the intersection of @xmath27 with a half space of the cayley graph of @xmath1183 . on the other hand , both and @xmath2 and @xmath27 are universal spaces for @xmath5 .",
