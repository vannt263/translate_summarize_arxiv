    "photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) is a recently developed coupled physics imaging modality that combines the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging with the high contrast of optical imaging @xcite .",
    "when a semitransparent sample is illuminated with a short pulse of laser light , parts of the optical energy are absorbed inside the sample , which in turn induces an acoustic pressure wave . in pat ,",
    "acoustic pressure waves are measured outside of the object of interest and mathematical algorithms are used to recover an image of the interior . initial work and also recent works in pat concentrated on the problem of reconstructing the initial pressure distribution , which has been considered as final diagnostic image ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the initial pressure distribution only provides qualitative information about the tissue - relevant parameters .",
    "this is due to the fact that the initial pressure distribution is the product of the optical absorption coefficient and the spatially varying optical intensity which again indirectly depends on the tissue parameters .",
    "quantitative photoacoustic tomography ( qpat ) addresses this issue and aims at quantitatively estimating the tissue parameters by supplementing the inversion of the acoustic wave equation with an inverse problem for the light propagation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) is commonly considered as a very accurate model for light transport in tissue ( see , for example , see @xcite ) and will be employed in this paper .",
    "as proposed in @xcite we work with a single - stage reconstruction procedure for qpat , where the optical parameters are reconstructed directly from the measured acoustical data .",
    "this is in contrast to the more common two - stage procedure , where the measured boundary pressure values are used to recover the initial internal pressure distribution in an intermediate step , and the spatially varying tissue parameters are estimated from the initial pressure distribution in a second step .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the two - stage approach has several drawbacks , such as the missing capability of dealing with multiple illuminations using incomplete acoustic measurements in each experiment .",
    "the single - stage strategy can also be combined with the diffusion approximation ; see @xcite .",
    "the diffusion approximation is numerically less costly to solve than the rte .",
    "however , we work with the rte since it is the more accurate model for light propagation in tissue .      in this paper , we study the linearized inverse problem of qpat using the rte .",
    "we present a uniqueness and stability analysis for both single and multiple illuminations .",
    "our strategy is to first analyze the optical ( heating ) and acoustic processes separately , and then combine them together .",
    "the uniqueness and stability analysis of the acoustic process is well established and we make use of existing results .",
    "the study of the heating process , on the other hand , is much less understood .",
    "its analysis is our main emphasis and our contribution includes several uniqueness and stability results .",
    "we derive stability estimates of the form @xmath0 for the unknown absorption parameter perturbation @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the actual and background absorption coefficients , respectively . here",
    "@xmath4 is the linearized forward operator of qpat with respect to the attenuation at @xmath3 .",
    "such results are derived under different conditions for vanishing scattering ( theorems  [ thm : sigma0-stablity ] and  [ thm : no ] ) , non - vanishing scattering ( theorem  [ thm : scatt ] ) , as well as multiple illuminations ( theorem   [ thm : multiple ] ) .",
    "our analysis is inspired by  @xcite where microlocal analysis was employed to analyze the stability of an inverse problem with internal data ( see also @xcite for related works ) .",
    "we also take advantage of previous works on rte @xcite and microlocal acoustic wave inversion @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of solving the linearized problem is illustrated by numerical simulations presented in section  [ sec : num ] . for numerically solving the linearized problem we use the landweber iteration that can also be employed for the fully non - linear problem , see @xcite .",
    "we point out that solving the linearized inverse problem is computationally much less costly than solving the fully non - linear problem .",
    "our numerical results show that in many situation the solution of the linearized problem already gives quite accurate reconstruction results .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : forward ] we present a hilbert space framework for qpat using the rte .",
    "we consider the single illumination as well as the multiple illumination case and recall the well - posedness of the non - linear forward operator .",
    "we further give its gteaux - derivative , whose inversion constitutes the linearized inverse problem of qpat . in section  [ sec : stability ]",
    "we present our main stability and uniqueness results for the linearized inverse problem .",
    "our theoretical results are supplemented by numerical examples presented in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "the paper concludes with a short summary and outlook presented in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we describe the forward problem of qpat in a hilbert space framework using the rte . allowing for @xmath5 different illumination patterns ,",
    "the forward problem is given by a nonlinear operator @xmath6 , where the operator @xmath7 models the optical heating and @xmath8 the acoustic measurement due to the @xmath9-th illumination .",

    "reconstruction results are shown in figure [ fig : thirdfull ] .",
    "it can be seen that also for larger scattering the edges of the squares are well resolved and the quantitative agreement of the reconstruction is still quite good .",
    "if the scattering rate in the interior is larger and thus the linearization point is chosen wrong then the algorithm has a tendency to overestimate the absorption .",
    "this is due to the fact that a larger scattering rate also leads to larger absorption by lowering the mean free path and thus potentially increasing the length that light has to travel to pass a high scattering area .",
    "note also that in the vicinity of high scattering areas the intensity increases because light is scattered out of that area with larger probability than in the other direction .",
    "thus the absorption in areas close to high scattering areas is underestimated and the absorption inside is overestimated .",

    "further , we were able to show injectivity and two - sided stability estimates for the linearized inverse problem using single as well a multiple illuminations .",
    "these results are presented in theorems  [ thm : sigma0-stablity ] and  [ thm : no ] for non - vanishing scattering , in theorem  [ thm : scatt ] ) for vanishing scattering , and in theorem   [ thm : multiple ] for multiple illuminations . in the case of non - vanishing scattering our condition guaranteeing injectivity",
    "requires quite small values of scattering and absorption at the linearization point .",
    "relaxing such assumptions is an interesting line of future research .",
    "another important aspect is the extension of our stability estimates to the fully non - linear case . finally , investigating single state qpat with multiple illuminations for moving object ( see @xcite for qualitative pat with moving object ) is also a challenging topic .    for numerical computations",
