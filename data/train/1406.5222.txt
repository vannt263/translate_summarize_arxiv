    "even though tantalizing experimental signatures of majorana particles have been reported in semiconductor quantum wires @xcite , there has been much less tangible progress to date in exploring and confirming their exotic physical properties or harnessing their potential for technological applications .",
    "further progress will be achieved by perfecting the existing devices and by engineering new systems which harbor unpaired majorana zero modes and are amenable to a wide range of experimental probes .",
    "indeed there is no shortage of theoretical proposals to implement and probe majorana particles in solid state systems @xcite .",
    "a specific system that we study in this paper consists of a chain of magnetic atoms , such as fe , cr or gd , deposited on the atomically flat surface of an ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductor such as pb or nb , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it has been shown previously that if the magnetic moments in the adatom chain form a spiral with the correct pitch , the shiba states @xcite ( that form inside the sc gap in response to the magnetic moments ) can give rise to an effective 1d topological superconductor ( tsc ) with majorana fermions bound to its ends @xcite . in practice",
    "such systems can be engineered and probed by scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite and preliminary spectroscopic evidence for zero modes has indeed been reported@xcite . unlike other proposals for majorana fermions",
    "this system does not rely on a strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) to produce a 1d topological state .",
    "instead , the exchange coupling of the electrons to the magnetic moments mimics the effect of soc when viewed in the reference frame rotating along with the spiral .",
    "thus , the parameter relevant to the topological phase is not the soc strength @xmath1 but the exchange coupling @xmath2 which can be large in solids , potentially leading to a more robust protection of the majorana zero modes .",
    "recently , a convenient way to effect majorana fermion braiding in this setup has been proposed @xcite .",
    ", calculated as described in section iii below , is also shown . ,",
    "width=264 ]    another interesting feature of the system is its self - organization property @xcite .",
    "as we shall review in more detail below , in a model describing the magnetic moments interacting with a superconductor , the spiral pitch @xmath3 must be in a certain relationship with the electron chemical potential @xmath4 for the system to exhibit the topological phase .",
    "the spiral pitch @xmath3 in turn depends on the coupling between the moments that is typically mediated by the electrons in the substrate . a priori it is not at all clear that the resulting equilibrium @xmath3 will have the correct value to bring about the topological phase .",
    "it is found @xcite , however , that at least in a simple 1d model the spiral pitch that minimizes the system energy is exactly the one required for the topological phase to emerge ",
    "remarkably , the system _ wants _ to be topological .",
    "recently , it has been argued @xcite that the self - organization property described above might only be effective in a purely 1d model and may thus not be relevant to a real experimental system that involves a 2d superconducting surface . the key insight behind refs .",
    "is that the spiral ordering vector @xmath3 will coincide with @xmath5 of the underlying normal electron gas because in 1d its static spin susceptibility @xmath6 peaks at @xmath7 .",
    "this behavior is only slightly modified by the inclusion of the superconducting order . in a 2d electron gas",
    ", however , @xmath6 has only an inflection point at @xmath5 and there is thus no reason to expect spiral ordering at @xmath8 .",
    "the authors of ref .   suggested introducing soc into the 2d problem to restore the spiral ordering .",
    "they also pointed out that small amounts of disorder , especially in the adatom positions , could destroy the spiral ordering and thus the topological phase .    with the goal of addressing the fate of the self - organization property away from a simple 1d model we perform a study here of a realistic lattice model ( similar to ref .  ) describing a 2d superconducting surface with electrons coupled to a 1d chain of magnetic moments positioned commensurately with the ionic lattice of the substrate .",
    "we consider both periodic and open ended chains , solving selfconsistently for the sc order parameter and the spiral pitch @xmath3 .",
    "our main finding is that the self - organization property previously established in a purely 1d model @xcite persists more or less intact in a model that takes into account the 2d geometry of the sc surface .",
    "a simple intuitive picture behind this result can be given as follows .",
    "as is well known from the physics of 1d quantum wires @xcite , for the system to be in the topological phase the magnetic gap must dominate over the sc gap @xmath9 . in our present setup",
    "this translates into the requirement that the exchange coupling @xmath2 must be larger than the sc pairing scale @xmath9 . in this limit , each magnetic moment acts as a strong pair breaking defect .",
    "a line of such strong pair breakers then locally suppresses @xmath10 essentially to zero as illustrated in fig .",
    "this `` trench '' in the sc pair potential hosts low - energy electron states that can be viewed as a 1d electron system described effectively by the same model as discussed in refs .  .",
    "the self - organization property of the 1d system is therefore recovered at the energy scales below the bulk superconducting gap @xmath11 .",
    "we also study the effects of disorder and find that it has only a mild effect on the stability of the topological phase . in a realistic system",
    "magnetic adatoms will be registered to the minima of the local surface potential which is necessarily commensurate with the underlying ionic lattice of the substrate . for this reason we feel that the positional disorder of the type emphasized in ref",
    ".   should not be relevant to the physical system . in our lattice model",
    "we study the substrate disorder ( modeled by local variations in the chemical potential @xmath4 ) and disorder in the exchange couplings @xmath2 .",

    "our selfconsistent calculations based on the 2d lattice hamiltonian ( [ hspi1a ] ) find that the magnetic moments tend to arrange in a coplanar spiral with an equilibrium pitch @xmath80 that depends on the system parameters . for a range of parameters that can be expected to occur in realistic systems",
    "( e.g.  gd atoms on a pb surface @xcite ) we find that @xmath80 adjusts itself such that the resulting wire forms a 1d topological superconductor with majorana zero modes bound to its ends .",
    "the self - organization property found previously in purely 1d models @xcite is thus recovered over a portion of the phase diagram in this more realistic 2d model .",
    "we emphasize that the topological phase occurs here in a fully su(2 ) symmetric model ",
    "soc is not required to bring it about ( although a small amount of soc may be needed to stabilize the spiral against thermal fluctuations @xcite , not considered in this work ) .",
    "an even more realistic model would include a full 3d description of the sc substrate .",
    "a fully selfconsistent calculation along the lines presented above is currently out of our reach due to a significant numerical cost incurred in modeling a sufficiently large 3d system .",
    "we expect , however , that the same mechanism that we uncovered in the 2d model will operate in 3d and the self - organization property should carry over largely intact .",

    "<S> electronic states associated with a chain of magnetic adatoms on the surface of an ordinary @xmath0-wave superconductor have been shown theoretically to form a one dimensional topological phase with unpaired majorana fermions bound to its ends . in a simple 1d effective model the system exhibits an interesting self - organization property : </S>",
    "<S> the pitch of the spiral formed by the adatom magnetic moments tends to adjust itself so that electronically the chain remains in the topological phase whenever such a state is physically accessible . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine the physics underlying this self - organization property in the framework of a more realistic 2d model of a superconducting surface coupled to a 1d chain of magnetic adatoms . </S>",
    "<S> treating both the superconducting order and the magnetic moments selfconsistently we find that the system retains its self - organization property , even if the topological phase extends over a somewhat smaller portion of the phase diagram compared to the 1d model . </S>",
