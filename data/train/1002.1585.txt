    "the final result of the data reduction of the above techniques is a data cube containing hundreds to thousands individual spectra to be analyzed , thus a common problem among the studies cited above is how to extract the information from these data cubes",
    ". a manually inspection of each spectrum is an exhaustive task and demand much time , so automated methods are needed to properly measure physical parameters from the data cubes .",
    "the most common method used to study the gaseous distribution and kinematics is based on the fitting of the emission - line profiles by gaussian curves .",
    "nevertheless , it is commonly reported in the literature the presence of asymmetries in the emission - line profiles , which are not well represented by gaussian curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several methods have been developed to fit line profiles ( e.g * ? ? ? * and iraf fitprofs and splot tasks ) , but most of these methods are based on the fitting of gaussian ( or lorentzian ) functions , in which the information of the wings of the line profile can be lost . a recent developed method to extract information from data cubes",
    "is the pca tomography , which uses principal component analysis ( pca ) to transform the system of correlated coordinates into a system of uncorrelated coordinates ordered by principal components of decreasing variance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases the ` traditional ' line - profile fitting method must be additionally used to properly extract the flux distribution and kinematics of the emitting gas .    in this work",
    "i present an automated line - profile fitting routine ( profit ) to be used to extract the gaseous kinematics and flux distribution from fits data cubes .",
    "this routine is written in idl language and allows the fit of the observed profiles by gauss - hermite series or gaussian curves .",
    "the fit of gauss - hermite series has been chosen because it preserve the velocity information of the emitting gas by the fitting of the wing of the emission - line profiles .",
    "such information could be lost in the fit of a single gaussian curve for an asymmetric emission - line profile .",
    "another advantage of the gauss - hermite profile is that it can be easily be implemented in an automated routine than multiple gaussian fit  which would also preserve the velocity information .",
