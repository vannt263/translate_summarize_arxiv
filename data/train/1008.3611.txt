    "due to their unique optical and energy - transfer properties molecular aggregates have attracted researchers for decades @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest in one - dimensional molecular aggregates consisting of a small number @xmath0 ( ranging from only two to a few tens ) of molecules @xcite , where finite size effects play an important role .",
    "such systems are e.g.  dendrimers @xcite , stacks of organic dye molecules @xcite or the light harvesting complexes in photosynthesis @xcite . usually in these aggregates",
    "there is negligible overlap of electronic wavefunctions between neighboring monomers .",
    "however , there is often a strong ( transition ) dipole - dipole interaction , that leads to eigenstates where an electronic excitation is coherently delocalized over many molecules of the aggregate , accompanied by often drastic changes in the aggregate absorption spectrum with respect to the monomer spectrum .",
    "since these changes depend crucially on the conformation of the aggregate , commonly the first step in the investigation of such aggregates is optical spectroscopy .",
    "important properties , like the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction can often already be deduced from these measurements @xcite . for small aggregates , often referred to as oligomers , the finite size leads to pronounced effects in their optical properties .",
    "the interpretation of measured absorption spectra is complicated by the fact that the electronic excitation couples strongly to distinct vibrational modes of the molecules and to the environment , leading to a broad asymmetric monomer absorption spectrum that often also shows a vibrational progression @xcite .",
    "because of this ( frequency dependent ) interaction with a quasi - continuum of vibrations , the theoretical treatment , even of quite small oligomers ( of the order of five to ten monomers ) , becomes a challenge .",
    "exact diagonalization @xcite is restricted to a small ( one to five ) number of vibrational modes .",
    "furthermore , to compare with experiments , the resulting `` stick - spectra '' have to be convoluted with some line - shape function to account for the neglected vibrations .",
    "for large aggregates the `` coherent exciton scattering '' ( ces ) approximation , which works directly with the monomer absorption line - shape as basic ingredient @xcite , has been shown to give very good agreement with experiment @xcite",
    ". however , one expects problems for small ( @xmath1 ) oligomers @xcite .    to treat oligomers with strong coupling to vibrational modes ,",
    "recently an efficient approach was put forward @xcite which is based on a non - markovian stochastic schrdinger equation . in the present paper this approach will be used to investigate the absorption of linear one - dimensional oligomers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] the hamiltonian of the aggregate is introduced followed by a brief review of our method to calculate the absorption spectrum in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "the calculated oligomer spectra are presented and discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary and an outlook .",
    "in this work we will use a commonly applied model of a molecular aggregate including coupling of electronic excitation to vibrations @xcite .",
    "we consider an oligomer consisting of @xmath0 monomers .",
    "the transition energy between the electronic ground and electronically excited state of monomer @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "we will investigate absorption from the state where all monomers are in their ground state .",
    "a state in which monomer @xmath2 is excited and all other monomers are in their ground state is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "states in which the whole aggregate has more than one electronic excitation are not considered .",
    "we expand the total hamiltonian @xmath5 of the interacting monomers and the vibrational environment with respect to the electronic `` one - exciton '' states @xmath4 .",
    "the purely electronic hamiltonian @xmath6 contains the interaction @xmath7 which describes exchange of excitation between monomer @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "the environment of each monomer is taken to be a set of harmonic modes described by the environmental hamiltonian @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the annihilation operator of mode @xmath11 of monomer @xmath2 with frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling of a local electronic excitation to its vibrational environment is assumed to be linear and the corresponding interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 where the coupling constant @xmath14 scales the coupling of the excitation on monomer @xmath2 to the mode @xmath11 with frequency @xmath15 of the local vibrational modes .",
    "this interaction is conveniently described by the spectral density @xmath16 of monomer @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the influence of the environment of monomer @xmath2 is encoded in the bath correlation function @xcite , which at temperature @xmath17 reads @xmath18 in this work we restrict the discussion to the case @xmath19 in which the bath - correlation function @xmath20 reduces to @xmath21 when the environment has no `` memory '' , i.e.  @xmath22 it is termed markovian , otherwise it is non - markovian .",
    "we use a recently developed method to describe the interaction of the excitonic system with a non - markovian environment @xcite which is based on ideas from a stochastic schrdinger equation approach to open quantum system dynamics @xcite . within this approach it is possible to exactly describe the dynamics governed by a hamiltonian of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_tot ] ) by a stochastic schrdinger equation in the hilbert space of the electronic system alone .",
    "however , due to the appearance of functional derivatives in this stochastic schrdinger equation , the general method is of limited practical use . to circumvent this problem in ref .",
    "@xcite these functional derivatives were approximated by operators @xmath23 which are independent of the stochastics and can be obtained from a set of coupled differential equations .    within this approximation the cross - section for absorption of light with frequency @xmath24 at zero - temperature is simply given by @xmath25 with initial condition @xmath26 and the polarization of the light @xmath27 .",
    "the state @xmath28 is obtained from solving a schrdinger equation in the small hilbert space of the excitonic system @xmath29 with initial condition ( [ eq : initial_state ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath30 appearing on the right hand side of equation ( [ schr_final ] ) contains the interaction with the environment upon excitation of monomer @xmath8 in an approximate way @xcite , and is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bathcor ] ) and the operator @xmath23 is obtained by solving @xmath33\\\\ & & + \\sum_l\\big [ { |\\,{\\pi_{l}}\\,\\rangle}{\\langle\\,{\\pi_{l}}\\ , | } \\nonumber    { \\bar{{d}}}^{(l)}(t ) ,   { d}^{(m)}(t , s)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with initial condition @xmath34 .",
    "this method allows a numerically fast and simple treatment of an assembly of interacting monomers with a complex environment .",
    "using the method described in the previous section we will now investigate the dependence of oligomer absorption spectra on the number @xmath0 of monomers and the interaction strength between them . to this end we choose a one dimensional arrangement of the monomers and take the transition energies to be equal , @xmath35 .",
    "we take only coupling between nearest neighbors into account , which we assume to be equal for all neighboring monomers , i.e.  @xmath36 for all @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we also take all transition dipole moments @xmath37 to be identical and parallel to the polarization of the light .",
    "this arrangement is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : skizze ] .    before including the complexity of the vibrations we will briefly discuss the purely electronic case , given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ham_sys ] . for the arrangement described above the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : ham_sys ] can be diagonalized analytically to obtain the eigenenergies @xmath38 where the sign and magnitude of @xmath39 depend crucially on the angle @xmath40 between the transition dipoles and the axis of the oligomer .",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath41 for absorption from the electronic ground state of the oligomer to an excited state with energy @xmath42 is given by @xcite @xmath43 where the oscillator strength of a monomer is taken to be unity . from this one",
    "sees that the state with @xmath44 , which is located at the edge of the exciton band , carries nearly all the oscillator strength . for large @xmath0",
    "it carries roughly 81% of the oscillator strength ; for @xmath45 even more than 90% .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath39 this state is either shifted to lower energies ( for @xmath46 ) or to higher energies ( for @xmath47 ) with respect to the electronic transition energy @xmath48 .",
    "note that with increasing number of monomers @xmath0 this state is shifted further away from the monomer transition energy , approaching for @xmath49 the value @xmath50 .",
    "note also that the absorption spectra for @xmath39 and @xmath51 are just mirror images of each other .",
    "this will change drastically when one includes coupling to vibrations .    for the vibrational environment we consider a continuum of frequencies so that the spectral density @xmath52 becomes a smooth function .",
    "exemplarily we will consider the monomer spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : monomer ] .",
    "this spectrum is obtained from a spectral density ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : monomer ] ) which is composed of a sum of lorentzians .",
    "the zero of energy is located at the transition energy @xmath48 . due to the strong interaction with the vibrations",
    "this spectrum is considerably broadened .",
    "it also shows a pronounced asymmetry ( it is much steeper at the low energy side ) .",
    "this strong asymmetry is mainly due to coupling to high energy vibrations with vibrational energies around @xmath53 , which is roughly the value of a c = c stretch mode in organic molecules .",
    "we will now take a closer look at the dependence of the oligomer spectra on the number @xmath0 of monomers for various values of the interaction strength @xmath39 .",
    "each column of fig .",
    "[ fig : oligomer ] shows , for a distinct value of the dipole - dipole interaction @xmath39 , a sequence of absorption spectra with increasing length @xmath0 of the oligomer from top to bottom .",
    "the values of @xmath39 and @xmath0 are indicated in the individual plots . on top of each column the monomer spectrum from fig .",
    "[ fig : monomer ] is shown again for comparison .",
    "in addition to the spectra calculated including all vibrational modes also `` stick - spectra '' resulting from the purely electronic theory are shown .",
    "the values chosen for the interaction strength @xmath39 between neighboring monomers are @xmath54 ( column 1 and 4 ) and @xmath55 ( column 2 and 3 ) .",
    "these values are of the order of magnitude as what is found in experiment @xcite .",
    "as explained above , the purely electronic stick spectra for opposite sign ( but same magnitude ) of @xmath39 are mirror images with respect to each other . however , as can clearly be seen , this is no longer the case for the spectra including coupling to the vibrations .",
    "although , in accordance with sum rules @xcite , the mean of each absorption spectrum is centered at the mean of the corresponding purely electronic spectrum , the line - shape is completely different for negative and positive interaction  @xmath39 .",
    "we will now discuss the dependence of the absorption spectra on @xmath0 and @xmath39 in more detail .",
    "for large negative interaction @xmath56 ( first column ) the absorption line - shape considerably narrows upon increasing the number @xmath0 of monomers of the oligomer .",
    "this exemplifies the appearance of the famous so - called j - band @xcite , a very narrow red - shifted peak found in the absorption spectra of large dye - aggregates .",
    "it shows a strong asymmetry , with a steep slope at the low energy side and a long tail extending to higher energies . due to this asymmetry of the line - shape",
    "the peak maximum appears shifted to lower energies with respect to the purely electronic `` stick '' . for weaker interaction @xmath57 ( second column ) the narrowing can already be seen , but is less pronounced than for @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , when increasing the number of monomers from 3 to 6 there is little change in the absorption spectrum for @xmath57 , while for @xmath56 there is still a noticeable narrowing .",
    "in contrast to the narrowing found for negative values of @xmath39 , for the same absolute value @xmath58 but positive @xmath39 , the spectra are much broader and show little resemblance with their negative counterparts .",
    "this is the typical case of the so - called h - band , which is blue - shifted with respect to the monomer absorption .",
    "note that for the present values of @xmath39 there is only minor change in the absorption spectrum for @xmath59 , which indicates that for larger @xmath0 finite size effects will no longer be of great importance .",
    "in this work we have investigated the properties of one - dimensional linear oligomers using a recently developed approach based on a stochastic schrdinger equation @xcite to handle coupling of the electronic excitation to vibrations .",
    "considering the length dependence of the oligomer spectra as well as the dependence on the dipole - dipole interaction between the monomers , we found that this approach , although approximate , is well suited to describe the basic features like the narrow j - band and the broad h - band . while in this work discussion",
    "was restricted to zero temperature , we plan to study the temperature dependence with the present method and compare to experiment ."
