    "there is an average milky way extinction relation , a(@xmath3)/a(v ) , over the wavelength range 0.125 @xmath4 m to 3.5 @xmath4 m , which is applicable to a wide range of interstellar dust environments , including lines of sight through diffuse dust , and dark cloud dust , as well as dust associated with star formation ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ( ccm ) ; cardelli & clayton 1991 ; mathis & cardelli 1992 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the existence of this relation , valid over a large wavelength interval , suggests that the environmental processes which modify the grains are efficient and affect all grains .",
    "the ccm relation depends on only one parameter , the ratio of total - to - selective extinction , r@xmath5 which is a crude measure of the size distribution of interstellar dust grains .",
    "however , the ccm relation does not appear to apply beyond the milky way .",
    "it does not always fit the observed extinction along sightlines observed in the magellanic clouds and m31 ( e.g. , clayton & martin 1985 ; fitzpatrick 1985 , 1986 ; clayton et al .",
    "1996 ; bianchi et al . 1996 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ; misselt , clayton , & gordon 1999 ) .",
    "the 2175   bump is weaker and the far - uv extinction is steeper in many of the magellanic cloud sightlines but there are also sightlines in both the lmc and smc where the dust extinction does follow ccm .",
    "the few lines of sight studied in m31 seem to show a ccm - like far - uv extinction and a weak 2175   bump ( bianchi et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the starburst nucleus of m33 appears to be associated with milky - way - type dust ( gordon et al .",
    "the variations in extinction properties seen in the magellanic clouds and m31 may be due to several factors .",
    "different environments , such as star formation regions where large amounts of uv radiation and shocks are present , may play a large role in processing dust .",
    "evidence for this can be seen in the lmc where two distinct wavelength dependences of uv extinction have been found for dust inside and outside the supergiant shell , lmc 2 , which lies on the southeast side of 30 dor .",
    "this structure was formed by the combined stellar winds and supernovae explosions from the stellar association at its center ( misselt et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the smc ,",
    "the dust properties are even more extreme , showing extinction curves for three of four sightlines which have virtually no bump and are very steep in the far - uv ( gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "although the dust responsible for these curves is located near regions of star formation in the smc , the environment is likely to be less severe than for the lmc 2 dust .",
    "the 30 dor region , where lmc 2 is located , is a much larger star forming region than any in the smc .",
    "the dust environments in starburst galaxies and qsos , which also show smc - like extinction , are much more extreme than 30 dor ( e.g. , gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ; pitman , clayton & gordon 2000 ; gordon , smith & clayton 2000 ) .",
    "the smc has star formation occurring at only 1% the rate of a starburst galaxy so other factors such as the known differences in metallicity between galaxies may be important ( fitzpatrick 1986 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ; misselt et al .",
    "1999 ) .    setting aside global metallicity differences ,",
    "are there sightlines in the galaxy where the dust environment is similar to those seen in the magellanic clouds ?",
    "real deviations from ccm are seen in the galaxy but deviations of the kind seen in the magellanic clouds have been seen only rarely ( cardelli & clayton 1991 ; mathis & cardelli 1992 ) .",
    "a few sightlines ( e.g. , 62542 , 204827 , and 210121 ) show weak bumps and anomalously strong far - uv extinction for their measured values of @xmath6 .",
    "their extinction curves are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "these deviant sightlines represent a variety of dust environments .",
    "the galactic sightline toward hd 62542 is somewhat similar to lmc 2 .",
    "its dust was swept up by bubbles blown by two nearby o stars ( cardelli & savage 1988 ) .",
    "hd 204827 is also in a star formation region where the dust has been subject to shocks ( clayton & fitzpatrick 1987 ) .",
    "hd 210121 lies behind a single cloud in the halo .",
    "there is no present activity near this cloud although it was ejected into the halo at some time in the past .",
    "there are some important differences between these galactic extinction curves and those in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the bump seen for hd 62542 is not just weak but it is very broad and shifted to the blue ( cardelli & savage 1988 ) .",
    "mantles on the bump grains has been suggested as the reason for the weak , broad , and shifted galactic bumps ( mathis & cardelli 1992 ; mathis 1994 ) .",
    "these sightlines show that dust in a variety of environments with a range of @xmath6 values can have extinction curves similar to those in the lmc . however , none of the anomalous galactic sightlines , seen in figure 1 , approach the smc extinction properties .",
    "the smc dust has weaker bumps and steeper far - uv extinction than any known galactic or lmc sightline .",
    "most of the galactic sightlines , that have been studied previously , differ in one respect from the lmc and smc sightlines .",
    "they are significantly more reddened than the magellanic cloud sightlines .",
    "in particular , those sightlines showing the greatest deviations from ccm , those near the supershell lmc 2 and those in the smc , all have e(b - v ) @xmath7 0.25 . of the twenty - nine ccm sightlines only two have e(b - v ) @xmath7 0.30 .",
    "the others range up to e(b - v ) = 1.2 .",
    "similarly , the fitzpatrick & massa sample of eighty stars includes only seven with e(b - v ) @xmath7 0.30 ( fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ; fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , the dust along the magellanic cloud sightlines is more diffuse and more representative of the warm intercloud medium than the cold cloud medium which is better represented in the galactic samples .",
    "kiszkurno - koziej & lequeux ( 1987 ) suggest from ans extinction measurements of 1200 stars in the galaxy that there may be a correlation between uv extinction parameters and distance from the galactic plane . as @xmath8 increases",
    ", the bump becomes weaker and the far - uv extinction stronger .",
    "these sightlines have low reddenings and long sightlines so they are also more diffuse and therefore more like those in the magellanic clouds . to investigate whether the extinction properties observed in the magellanic clouds are related to the diffuse nature of the sightlines , a sample of long sightlines with low reddenings in the galaxy was chosen and uv data were obtained with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) so that extinction curves could be constructed .",
    "sembach , danks , & savage ( 1993 ) obtained high resolution na i d and ca ii k spectra for a sample of distant ( d @xmath0 1 kpc ) stars .",
    "these sightlines were selected to investigate the distribution and physical conditions of gas located in low density regions of the galactic disk and halo .",
    "the sightlines listed in table 1 were selected from the sembach et al .",
    "sample for a complementary study of the uv extinction properties of interstellar dust in low density conditions .",
    "the sembach et al .",
    "sample is limited to stars with spectral types between o8 and b3 which makes them ideal for extinction studies . following the definitions of sembach et al .",
    "the sightlines in table 1 lie outside the sagittarius spiral arm ( ia1 ) , between the sagittarius and scutum - crux spiral arms ( ia2 ) , beyond the scutum - crux arm toward the galactic center ( gc ) , and the inner 4 kpc of the galaxy ( igc ) .",
    "the stars lie at distances ranging from 1.5 to 9.5 kpc and have heights above or below the plane of 0 to 1.5 kpc .",
    "twelve of the sightlines extend into the galactic halo , defined as @xmath8 @xmath0 500 pc .",
    "the locations of these stars in the galaxy are plotted in figure 1 of sembach et al .",

    "this region ( sembach & danks 1994 ( hereafter the sd region ) ) coincides with an area of galactic longitude , l=325@xmath174 to 0@xmath174 , where large forbidden velocities have been observed in the gas .",
    "figure 3 shows bump strength plotted against far - uv steepness for our sample extinction curves .",
    "the bump strength can be quantified as the area under the bump using the fm parameters to be @xmath175 ( fitzpatrick & massa 1986 ) . the steepness of the far - uv extinction can be characterized using the fm parameter , @xmath166 , which represents the slope of the linear background .",
    "seven of the nine sightlines lying in the sd region have the largest values of @xmath166 in our sample .",
    "six of these sightlines also have bump strengths below the galactic average .",
    "the sightlines in our sample outside the sd region have values of bump strength and @xmath166 grouped around the galactic average . as can be seen in figure 3 , the sd region",
    "extinction parameters fall roughly along a line running from the average galactic values through the lmc and lmc 2 averages to the those seen in the smc .",
    "this is a promising result as it indicates that whatever factors are affecting the dust properties in the magellanic clouds may also be affecting the low density dust in the milky way . as discussed below",
    ", the two sd - region stars which appear in the upper left - hand corner of figure 3 do not share the extinction properties of the rest of the sd region sample .",
    "the locations of the stars in our sample are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "we have separated sightlines according to the steepness of the far - uv extinction as measured by @xmath166 and also the ratio , n(ca ii)/n(na i ) , which measures the relative fraction of cloud and intercloud medium along a sightline .",
    "a high value indicates a high fraction of intercloud medium .",
    "all of the sightlines in table 1 with both n(ca ii)/n(na i ) @xmath0 0.62 and @xmath176 1.02 lie in the sd region .",
    "figure 5 shows height above or below the galactic plane plotted against distance in the plane for the stars in the sd region .",
    "figures 4 and 5 clearly show the anomalous extinction is seen only for stars in one particular direction .",
    "the two stars in the sd region , that do not share the anomalous extinction of the other sightlines , provide information on the location of this dust .",
    "hd 151805 has b= 1.59@xmath174 so its sightline does not go below the galactic plane as do the other stars in the sample .",
    "hd 161653 lies at a distance of 1.8 kpc and is , by far , the closest star in the l=325@xmath174 to 0@xmath174 region .",
    "so the dust responsible for the magellanic - cloud - like extinction lies further than about 2 kpc and in a direction defined by 325@xmath1 and -5@xmath177 .",
    "in fact , the four sightlines with the steepest extinction , hd 158243 , 160993 , 163522 , and 164340 , most resembling the smc extinction , lie in an even smaller region bounded by 337@xmath178 and -8@xmath177 .",
    "these four stars also have the lowest reddenings .",
    "so the remaining three less - extreme sightlines are likely a combination of clouds including more ccm - like dust as well .",
    "kennedy , bates , & kemp ( 1998 ) give a nice analysis of the absorption components in this direction of the sky including the sightline to hd 163522 ( l = 349.6 , b = -9.1 , d= 9.4 kpc ) . in their picture ,",
    "nearby clouds at 50 pc , 100 pc to 1 kpc , the sagittarius ( 1.5 - 2 kpc ) and scutum - crux ( 3 kpc ) spiral arms all provide absorption components with negative or small positive velocities .",
    "they identify peculiar velocity gas corresponding to the forbidden velocities of + 10 - 50 km s@xmath171 found by sembach & danks ( 1994 ) .",
    "these forbidden velocities differ significantly from those expected purely from galactic rotation .",
    "the origin and distance of this gas is not well known .",
    "higher ionization ions are associated with this gas indicating that it may be associated with a galactic fountain or worm ( savage , massa , & sembach 1990 ; savage , sembach , & cardelli 1994 ) .",
    "the extinction curves for the sightlines inside and outside of the sd region are plotted together in figure 6 .",
    "two sightlines , toward hd 151805 and 161653 , in the sd region show normal ccm ( @xmath6 = 3.1 ) extinction .",
    "as discussed above , the dust along those sightlines is not located in the same volume of space with the sd type dust so they are plotted with the non - sd - region sample in figure 6 .",
    "the average sd - region curve ( again not including hd 151805 and 161653 ) is plotted in figure 7 along with the average milky way and magellanic cloud curves for comparison .",
    "the average sd - region curve most resembles the hd 62542 and 210121 curves , seen in figure 1 , as well as the lmc 2 curve .",
    "the four steepest sd - region curves resemble the smc bar curve in the far - uv but still have stronger bump strengths .",
    "these curves show little or no slope change from the near to the far - uv while most other curves seen in figures 1 and 7 tend to turn up steeply to the blue of the bump .",
    "the environments of the lmc 2 and hd 62542 dust may be quite similar to the sd region dust .",
    "all are in diffuse regions subject to shocks and strong uv radiation fields .",
    "the sightline to hd 210121 contains one quiescent cloud with e(b - v ) = 0.40 .",
    "however , this cloud is located in the halo and shows uv extinction quite similar to the that seen in the sd region .",
    "calcium is heavily depleted indicating that grain destruction has not been an important mechanism in producing the unusual extinction ( welty & fowler 1992 ) . the low optical depth of the magellanic sightlines implies that the dust is not well shielded from these environmental pressures .",
    "the typical molecular cloud in the magellanic clouds is bigger but more diffuse than in the galaxy ( pak et al .",
    "then , the small size of the dust grains in a cloud could be the result of the lack of a very dense environment necessary for the grains to grow through coagulation .",
    "this has been suggested as the cause of the anomalous extinction seen along the hd 210121 sightline ( larson et al . 1996 ; 2000 ) .",
    "this kind of low density sightline may mimic the conditions in the smc where extinction properties have been measured over long sightlines with low values of e(b - v ) = 0.15 - 0.24 ( gordon & clayton 1998 ) . the value of n(ca ii)/n(na i ) is not known for the smc sightlines but the ca ii abundance in the gas phase is much higher than in the galaxy for a given reddening ( cohen 1984 ) .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio in general in the smc is ten times that of the galaxy ( koornneef 1983 ) .",
    "the gas - to - dust ratio in our low density galactic sample is not significantly different from the average galactic value ( sembach & danks 1994 ) .",
    "this implies that the gas - to - dust ratio is not well correlated with dust extinction properties .",
    "the forbidden velocities seen in our sample are associated with warm intercloud material and the turbulent ism ( sembach & danks 1994 ) and may indicate that the dust may have been subject to shocks .",
    "sembach & savage ( 1996 ) investigated the gas and dust abundances in the halo , finding that they are consistent with progressively more severe processing of grains from the disk into the halo .",
    "in addition , they find that while some material is returned to the gas phase , the grain cores seem resistant to destruction .",
    "dust models indicate that the far - uv rise in the extinction curve becomes steeper with increased frequency of exposure to shocks which produces more small dust grains ( odonnell & mathis 1997 )",
    ". however , the frequently shocked dust models that produce steeper far - uv extinction also result in stronger bumps .",
    "so , producing an smc - like extinction curve is not as simple as placing dust in a diffuse environment and waiting for a supernova shock .",
    "the next logical step is to attempt to directly connect grain properties to their respective sightline environments .",
    "consequently , we have included the average sd region extinction curve in a comprehensive study of dust in the local group where our goal is to explicitly examine the correlation of grain size distributions to sightline characteristics such as depletion patterns , and radiation environment ( wolff et al . 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath179 magellanic - cloud - like extinction has now been found in the milky way .",
    "+ @xmath179 large values of n(ca ii)/n(na i ) indicating low depletion are associated with steep far - uv extinction as measured by @xmath166 .",
    "+ @xmath179 global metallicity seems not to be a direct factor .",
    "local environmental conditions seem to be the most important factor in determining dust properties .",
    "+ @xmath179 similar uv dust extinction properties have now been seen in the milky way , the magellanic clouds , starburst galaxies and in high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "+ @xmath179 there may be at least two ways to achieve similar extinction properties .",
    "a lack of dust coagulation has been suggested for hd 210121 to explain the observed extinction ( larson et al .",
    "the galactic sd - region properties are closely tied to forbidden velocities indicating that processing of the grains in the diffuse ism resulted in their observed properties .",
    "+ @xmath179 there seems to be a correlation between decreasing bump strength and far - uv steepness that includes the galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "+ @xmath179 all the sightlines contained in ccm lie within 1 kpc of the sun .",
