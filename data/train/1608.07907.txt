    "a general description of the phase diagram of qcd includes several phases among which confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are the most relevant for the low energy regime .",
    "however what it is known and can be extracted from experiments regarding the low lying meson spectroscopy suggest that in order to explain thier properties one would need to take into account besides the usual `` two quark '' mesons also the possibility that `` four quark '' states might also exist .",
    "tetraquark states were first introduced by jaffe @xcite in the mit bag model and later explored in several studies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the unusual inverted scalar spectrum may be determined by a large `` four quark '' composition .",
    "if bound states of four quarks exist then it is natural to consider also their condensates .",
    "the appearance of multi fermion bound states and condensates is not taken usually into account as a separate phenomenon in drawing the phase diagram of a strong theory because it is assumed that the confining and chiral symmetry breaking processes are somehow continuous and do not yield multiple phase transitions .    in this paper",
    "we examine a picture where the actual confinement and chiral symmetry breaking take place in steps or stages each one corresponding to a different phase transition . we shall call this process `` cascade confinement and chiral symmetry breaking '' and in essence consists in a series of phase transitions each one occurring at a different scale and coupling constant and corresponding to a different number of fermions that bound together or condensate . we will study in detail two cases : qcd at a regular scale where",
    "quark and bound states of quark exist ; qcd at a higher scale where the elementary fermions are the preons that constitute the quark components , composite model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the formation of `` four quark '' condensate represents a separate phase transition was recently introduced in @xcite .",

    "iii we calculate the `` four quark '' condensate in a simple nambu jona lasinio mechanism . in section",
    "iv we discuss the phenomenon of cascade confinement and chiral symmetry breaking for regular qcd whereas in section v we analyze the same issues for qcd at higher scales that contains preons in a composite picture .",
    "section vi is dedicated to conclusions .",
    "in this work we consider a picture in which a nonabelian gauge group may present the phenomenon of cascade confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , indicating the possibility that confinement and chiral symmetry breaking may take place in steps or stages as one goes to lower scales where the coupling constant gets larger and multiparticle states or condensates may form .",
    "we shall discuss in particular the @xmath0 group but our findings may extend to other strong theories .",
    "we assume that at a high scale the fermion fields situated in some representation @xmath1 of the gauge group confine and form singlet bound states of two or three fermions . at a slightly lower scale",

    "here we took into account the fact that @xmath5 fermions lead to the formation of @xmath25 scalar states and @xmath25 pseudoscalar states which correspond to @xmath23 real scalar degrees of freedom . for the number of baryons we consider that in the structure @xmath26 where each entry corresponds to a fermion the last two states must be antisymmetric and thus different in order to form a baryon with the spin @xmath22 .",
    "thus the total number of states is @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to the number of possibilities for the last two entries ( see @xcite for details about the counting of states ) .",
    "then the absence of the initial colored fermion states and the formation of baryon and meson like colored states modify the beta function ( @xmath29 ) according to : @xmath30    on the other hand we will consider a model proposed in @xcite where at a higher scale the @xmath0 group contains @xmath31 fermions in the complex conjugate product representation and study the possibility of cascade confinement down to qcd . at a higher scale",

    "<S> we examine a toy model and a cascade effect for confinement and chiral symmetry breaking which consists in several phase transitions corresponding to the formation of bound states and chiral condensates with different number of fermions for a strong group . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze two examples : regular qcd where we calculate the `` four quark '' vacuum condensate and a preon composite model based on qcd at higher scales . in this context </S>",
    "<S> we also determine the number of flavors at which the second chiral and confinement phase transitions occur and discuss the consequences . </S>"
