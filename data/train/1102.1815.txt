    "the observed accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite is currently one of the central issues of observational and theoretical cosmology .",
    "it somehow came as a surprise to discover that the universe is not progressively slowing down its pace , but actually rocketing it up .",
    "the usual explanatory paradigm for this striking observation assumes the existence of the so - called _ dark energy _",
    "( de) a mysterious cosmic component with negative pressure , which , in contrast to dark matter ( dm ) , does not cluster ( at least in a comparable way ) and pervades all corners of the universe .",
    "an obvious candidate for the de is a strictly constant cosmological term , @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , this option precludes the possibility of a time evolution of the de ( which might be appealing so as to face the so - called coincidence problem , namely the fact that the current matter density @xmath8 is so close to the de density @xmath9 , or , equivalently , the fact that the acceleration epoch started so recently ) .",
    "this drawback could be cured by admitting that the cc can be a dynamical quantity : @xmath6 , an option which is perfectly admissible by the cosmological principle .",
    "actually , the mere possibility of a variable cc approach was explored long ago on purely phenomenological grounds  cf.@xcite ",
    "although many of the models are little motivated . at present , we know that the idea of a slowly running cc is in general compatible with the experimental data@xcite and there are reasonable theoretical models grounded on fundamental physical principles that can support these ideas , meaning that there is no strict need to invoke ad hoc scalar fields to generate a time dependence for the de  see@xcite and references therein , see also @xcite for recent alternative approaches reinforcing this point of view . still , the variable @xmath6 models can be dealt with in terms of a self - conserved de fluid in the manner of a scalar field ( as we can not know a priori the very nature of the de , and hence we may be naturally tempted to keep on using this simple scalar field approach ) . however , although this description in terms of scalar fields ( which may be called the `` de picture '' of the original @xmath6 model@xcite ) is perfectly possible , the corresponding effective equation of state ( eos ) for the de , @xmath10 , will be a non - trivial function of time or of the redshift , @xmath11 , and in general it can not be reduced to the standard forms proposed in the literature . in other words , the effect of having a variable cosmological term @xmath6 can not be described by the simple parameterizations usually employed for @xmath12 , characterized by two parameters @xmath13 that become constrained by the observations@xcite .",
    "the effective eos of a variable vacuum model is in general more complicated than that .",
    "this is shown in detail , with specific examples , in reference @xcite .",
    "in particular , the vacuum models that we are going to consider can not be described with these simple parameterizations .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6 models must be studied on their own and constitute an independent class of de models .",
    "it means that we should be more open minded on the form that the effective eos can adopt , and we should not limit ourselves to some admittedly popular ( albeit perhaps too simple ) forms utilized too often in the literature .    remarkably , the variable @xmath6 approach can also be advantageously employed for solving ( or highly palliating ) the big or `` old '' cc problem@xcite , viz .",
    "the absolutely formidable task of trying to explain the value itself of the current vacuum energy density @xmath14 gev@xmath15 on the face of its enormous input value @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 gev ) left over in the very early times , presumably just after the inflation phase induced by a grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "this option has been recently investigated in@xcite , and we will also review it here .",
    "it is based on the idea of `` relaxation '' of the effective vacuum energy density @xmath18 .",
    "relaxation offers indeed an entirely different perspective on the old cc problem ; in particular , it provides the extremely appealing possibility to solve the cc problem _ dynamically _ , hence _ _ without fine tuning__@xcite .",
    "moreover , the current value of the expansion rate @xmath19 becomes determined by an approximate relation of the form @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly enough , this relation tells us that @xmath21 is small just because the initial vacuum energy @xmath22 was very large !    in the next sections , i summarize the general notion and properties of the models with time - dependent vacuum energy , and consider specific scenarios possessing very interesting features concerning the possible solution , or at least significant alleviation , of some of the most fundamental cosmological constant problems of modern times .",
    "suppose that we are given a model where the vacuum energy density @xmath2 is time evolving through its dependence on other cosmological function(s ) of the cosmic time , e.g. @xmath23 .",
    "we take this starting `` picture '' as the original ( physical ) representation of the de , and we call it `` the cc picture '' . in general , other fundamental `` constants '' can also be varying , in particular the gravitational coupling @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , in the cc picture we will have in general two functions , at least , of the cosmic time or the cosmological redshift , namely @xmath25 of course other fundamental parameters could also be variable .",
    "for example , the fine structure constant has long been speculated as being potentially variable with the redshift .",
    "however , here we focus purely on the potential variability of the most genuine fundamental gravitational parameters of einstein s equations , to wit : @xmath0 and @xmath24 .    for a cosmological model of the kind ( [ varibleccg ] ) , the general bianchi identity of the einstein tensor leads to @xmath26=0 $ ] . in the flrw metric , and modeling the universe as a perfect fluid",

    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are certain functions of the redshift .",
    "they must satisfy @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in accordance with the current cosmic sum rule @xmath36 for a flat universe .    on the other hand , the above cosmological dynamics in the cc picture can also be described in terms of an alternative fluid with covariantly self - conserved densities @xmath37 , therefore satisfying @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 will be , in general , a function of the redshift : @xmath41 .",
    "of course @xmath42 and @xmath43 in general .",
    "the hubble rate in the new picture takes on the form : @xmath44\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 we have defined @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the current value of the critical density . notice that the parameter @xmath48 need not coincide with @xmath49 , as they are determined from two different parameterizations of the de data .",
    "similarly , we have defined @xmath50  and its current value @xmath51 .",
    "notice also that @xmath52 ( @xmath53 being the planck mass ) is strictly constant , whereas @xmath24 in eq.([hlambda ] ) is in general a variable function of the redshift : @xmath54 .",
    "the cosmological picture characterized by the _ self - conserved _ pair of energy densities @xmath37 at fixed @xmath55 will be called the `` de picture''@xcite .",
    "since the two pictures are assumed to be equivalent descriptions of the same cosmological evolution , their matching requires that the expansion history of the universe is the same in both pictures , i.e. that their hubble functions are numerically equal : @xmath56 recall that we take the original picture ( [ varibleccg ] ) as the physical one , whereas the de picture plays the role of an effective description of the former in terms of the self - conserved de component @xmath57 at fixed @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath58 defined above can be considered as the `` effective eos '' ( in the `` de picture '' ) of the original model ( [ varibleccg ] ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation , using the matching condition ( [ matching ] ) and the general bianchi identity ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) , allows to determine the effective eos function @xmath58 in terms of the fundamental parameters of the original theory ( [ varibleccg ] ) , as follows@xcite : @xmath59 where we have defined @xmath60 , and @xmath61\\,.\\ ] ] in particular , for a model of the kind ( [ varibleccg ] ) with fixed @xmath62 in the matter epoch ( @xmath63 ) , the effective eos simply reads @xmath64 .",
    "the latter would shrink to just @xmath65 only in case of a truly cosmological constant @xmath66 because then @xmath57 would coincide with it . with the help of the matching condition ( [ matching ] ) of the two pictures , and the bianchi identity",
    ", one can also show , with some effort , that @xmath67 this is a remarkable relation , if we recall the conditions @xmath68 fulfilled by the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 in eq.([hlambda ] ) .",
    "why is remarkable ?",
    "as @xmath49 and @xmath48 must be very close , and @xmath71 is presumably monotonous , eq.([dzeta ] ) shows that a value @xmath72 _ always _ exists for which the _ l.h.s .",
    "_ of eq.([dzeta ] ) vanishes and , therefore , the effective eos @xmath58 crosses the phantom divide at that point : @xmath73 . whether the crossing is in the recent past or in the immediate future",
    ", it will depend on the details of the original model ( [ varibleccg ] ) .",
    "notice , however , that if @xmath74 , then the crossing will be exactly at @xmath75 , i.e. now .",
    "this shows that a generic model ( [ varibleccg ] ) with time varying vacuum energy , when described in the de picture ( i.e. as if it were a cosmological self - conserved de fluid ) generally leads to a crossing of the phantom divide , thus providing a possible natural explanation for the observational data  which still admit a tilt in the phantom domain@xcite .",
    "in contradistinction to purely phenomenological models of time dependent @xmath0@xcite , we adopt here the fundamental point of view that the @xmath0 term is a running parameter in qft in curved space - time@xcite .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , we should have a corresponding renormalization group ( rg ) equation of the general form @xmath76 in which @xmath77 is an arbitrary scale associated to the rg running .",
    "of course the full effective action is perfectly scale independent ( i.e. rg invariant)@xcite , and the running of the vacuum energy should ultimately reflect the dependence of the leading quantum effects with respect to some physical cosmological quantity @xmath3 associated with @xmath77 , hence @xmath78 . despite it being a matter of debate , it has been argued by different methods@xcite that the physical scale @xmath79 pointed by the @xmath77-dependence is the hubble rate @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath80 evolves with the cosmic time , the cosmological term inherits a time - dependence through its primary scale evolution with @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 in eq.([rgeg1a ] ) are obtained after summing over the loop contributions of fields of different masses @xmath82 and spins @xmath83 .",
    "the general behavior is @xmath84@xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath85 , the series above is ( for @xmath86 ) an expansion involving powers of the small quantities @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "given , however , that @xmath89 , we see that the heaviest fields furnish the dominant contribution .",
    "this trait ( `` soft - decoupling '' ) represents a generalization of the decoupling theorem in qft . in addition , being @xmath90 , the condition @xmath91 is amply met for all known particles , and the series on the _",
    "r.h.s _ of eq.([rgeg1a ] ) converges extremely fast at present .",
    "also important is the fact that only even powers of @xmath87 are consistent with general covariance , see@xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath92 contribution is absent because it corresponds to terms @xmath93 that give an extremely fast evolution .",
    "actually , from the rg point of view they are already excluded because , as noted above , @xmath91 for all known masses . in practice only the first term @xmath94 is needed , with @xmath82 of the order of the highest mass available .",
    "as the dominant masses @xmath82 will be of order of a gut mass scale @xmath95 near the planck mass @xmath53 , it is convenient to introduce the ratio @xmath96 , in which @xmath97 depending on whether bosons or fermions dominate in their loop contributions to ( [ rgeg1a ] ) . if the effective mass @xmath95 of the heavy particles is just @xmath53 , the parameter @xmath98 takes the value @xmath99 , with @xmath100 . in general",
    "we expect that @xmath98 will take values of this order or below . under the very good approximation @xmath94 , and with @xmath87 , eq.([rgeg1a ] ) abridges to @xmath101 whose solution is @xmath102 with @xmath103    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     solving the model in the original cc picture@xcite leads to a non - standard evolution law for the matter density as a function of the redshift : @xmath104 , along with the following evolution of the vacuum energy density : @xmath105\\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath106 we recover the @xmath0cdm results , of course .",
    "but for @xmath107 we have a model in which the vacuum energy decays into matter ( or vice versa ) according to the generalized conservation law ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) , with @xmath108 in this case . with this rg model of the cosmic evolution at hand ,",
    "we may now use it to apply the procedure of section [ ccdepicture ] for obtaining the effective properties of the model in the `` de picture '' ( in which matter and dark energy are separately conserved ) . obviously , for this particular model , @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding effective eos can not be described with standard parameterizations@xcite . indeed , from equation ( [ we2 ] )  using ( [ if ] ) and ( [ crg ] )",
    " we find : @xmath110-(1-\\nu)\\,[\\tilde{\\omega}_m^0\\,(1+z)^3 - 1]}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath111 is the difference of the cosmological mass parameters in the two pictures ( corresponding to two different fits of the same data ) .",
    "for @xmath112 we may expand the previous result to first order in @xmath98 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath113 , we find @xmath114 this result reflects the essential qualitative features of the analysis presented in the previous section , where in this case @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath116 eq.([expwq ] ) shows that we get an ( effective ) phantom - like behavior ( @xmath117 ) , whereas for @xmath118 we have an ( effective ) quintessence behavior ( @xmath119 ) . in other words ,",
    "this variable cc model can give rise to two types of very different qualitative behaviors by changing the sign of a single parameter .",
    "in fig.[plot1 ] we show also more general cases where @xmath120 , corresponding to @xmath121 .",
    "in contrast to the previous situation , here the variable cc model may exhibit phantom behavior for @xmath118 ( if @xmath122 ) , and manifests itself through the existence of a transition point @xmath123 in our recent past  marked explicitly in the figure  as predicted by the general formalism of section [ ccdepicture ] .",
    "let us also examine another interesting situation . from eq.([bianchigeneral ] )",
    ", we see that if @xmath7 is variable and we assume that matter is conserved ( thus no transfer of energy with the time dependent vacuum @xmath124 ) , we have @xmath125 . from eq.([if ] ) it is then not difficult to show that in eq.([if ] ) satisfies the differential equation @xmath126 .",
    "next one notes that the previous equation is also solved by the alternative expression below : @xmath127 ] @xmath128\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the crossing point of the phantom divide , which satisfies @xmath129 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath24 is asymptotically free  that is to say , if @xmath130 decreases with redshift  we should observe quintessence behavior ( @xmath131 ) for @xmath132 ; whereas if @xmath24 is `` ir free '' ( i.e. it increases with @xmath133 , hence decreases with the expansion ) , we should then have phantom behavior ( @xmath134 ) in that interval .",
    "an interesting example of model of this kind appears if we take once more the evolution law ( [ cch ] ) for the vacuum energy , but assume now that matter is conserved@xcite .",
    "the basic cosmological equations can be formulated in the following compact way : @xmath135\\ \\ \\ ( { \\rm friedmann\\ equation})\\nonumber\\\\ & & ( { \\omega_m}+{\\omega_{\\lambda}})dg+g\\,d{\\omega_{\\lambda}}=0 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( { \\rm bianchi\\ identity})\\label{bianchi2}\\\\ & & { \\omega_{\\lambda}}(z)={\\omega_{\\lambda}^0}+\\nu\\left[e^2(z)-1\\right]\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( { \\rm running\\ { \\rho_{\\lambda } } } ) \\nonumber\\ , , \\label{rglaw3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "it is now straightforward to solve them for the gravitational coupling , which becomes a logarithmically running quantity of the hubble rate : @xmath138 we see that @xmath24 is asymptotically free ( resp .",
    "ir free ) for @xmath116 ( resp .",
    "@xmath118 ) . an alternative formulation of this running law for @xmath24 and @xmath139 , motivated by the quantum physics of inflation , was presented in @xcite .",
    "the previous considerations show that we have plenty of theoretical and phenomenological motivations to support the possibility of observing running cosmological parameters , specially through the study of time - evolving vacuum cosmologies .",
    "ultimately this issue must of course be backed up by observations , and in this sense it is very important to try to find all possible phenomenological indications suggesting such a vacuum dynamical picture .",
    "it is also remarkable that one could even find signs of the running @xmath0 in the astrophysical context ; for example , through the study of the implications that a variable @xmath0 distributed ( homogeneously or inhomogeneously ) in a large domain could have in the process of local structure formation , see@xcite .",
    "time - evolving vacuum models inspired by qft principles could do even more : they could provide a possible solution to the cosmic coincidence problem , and ultimately to the `` old cosmological constant problem '' , namely the cc fine - tuning problem  the toughest cosmological conundrum of all times@xcite .",
    "possible avenues leading to a significant step in this direction are summarized in the next two sections .",
    "the @xmath0xcdm model@xcite makes a further step in our systematic approach to a cosmology with variable cosmological parameters .",
    "it is based on assuming that we have a composite de energy density @xmath140 . in the canonical case where",
    "@xmath108 , it can be taken as covariantly conserved : @xmath141 and in these conditions matter is self - conserved too of course : @xmath142 . here @xmath143 is the energy density of the running @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath144 is the energy density of a new dynamical entity @xmath145 that we call the `` cosmon '' .",
    "its dynamics is completely determined by the above local conservation law ( [ fosc ] ) once the evolution for @xmath146 is given .",
    "as emphasized in@xcite , this implies that in general it will be an effective entity , not a fundamental one ( i.e. @xmath145 is _ not _ supposed to be a scalar field @xmath147 ) because the dynamics imposed by ( [ fosc ] ) will in general make it incompatible with the scalar potential provided for @xmath147 .",
    "the cosmon @xmath145 , instead , embodies the behavior of terms in the effective action of qft in curved space - time , and , far from being an elementary scalar field , it represents a convenient way to parametrize the effect of those terms in the cosmological evolution .",
    "the eos of the cosmon is indicated by @xmath148 ( assumed , for the moment , to be constant for simplicity ) .",
    "it should not be confused with the effective eos of the total de , which reads @xmath149 next we will assume that @xmath150 is the same function of @xmath19 as in the running @xmath0cdm model presented in section [ rgmodel1 ]  cf .",
    "eqs.([cch ] ) and ( [ c0c1 ] ) .",
    "notice that this does not mean that its redshift evolution is still given by eq.([crg ] ) , as here the overall conservation law is no longer ( [ bianchigeneral ] ) but ( [ fosc ] ) .",
    "after solving explicitly the details of this new cosmological model  which we refrain from reporting here@xcite  the normalized energy densities @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) with respect to the present critical density @xmath153 become determined as a function of the redshift ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig4]a ) .",
    "we see that the cosmon density @xmath154 can be negative , although this is not too surprising for an effective quantity that does not represent a fundamental field . on the other hand",
    "we observe that the total de density @xmath155 behaves properly , and its current value is the measured de value , i.e. we have @xmath156 with @xmath157 ( flat space ) .",
    "furthermore , the eos function @xmath158 can display a rich variety of behaviors while being in agreement with the most recent data@xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig4]b , where we see that , depending on the value of @xmath98 , the eos can be quintessence - like , or mimic ( in some cases almost exactly ) a pure cc term ( @xmath159 ) , and it can even exhibit a mild transition from the phantom to the quintessence regime . from fig.[fig4]b",
    "we recognize that this model is a spectacular example of cosmology , in which despite of the fact that the vacuum energy @xmath150 is a running quantity , the effective eos of the composite de can approach the standard @xmath0cdm model in an arbitrary way , and may display only small `` quintessence - like '' or `` phantom - like '' departures from it , thus mimicking a scalar field even in situations where such field could not behave canonically ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "[ ratiordrm ]    the truly nice feature of a model of this kind , however , is that it can cure or highly alleviate the `` cosmic coincidence problem '' . recall that this problem is related to the behavior of the ratio @xmath161 between the dark energy density and the matter energy density . in the standard @xmath0cdm model , that ratio increases arbitrarily with the cosmic evolution because @xmath57 is just the strictly constant vacuum energy density @xmath162 , whereas @xmath163 with the expansion , so there is no apparent reason why we should find ourselves precisely in an epoch where @xmath164 . or , to put in other terms : there is no obvious reason why the epoch where the universe started to accelerate is so recent .",
    "this is an unexplained coincidence puzzle in the standard model . not so in the @xmath0xcdm model , in which , thanks to the presence of the cosmon @xmath145",
    ", the function @xmath165 presents a maximum at the resdhift @xcite : @xmath166^{\\frac{1}{3\\,(1+{\\omega_x}-\\epsilon)}}-1\\,,\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath167 .",
    "one can show that this point can not be in our past@xcite , so it will generally be in the future ( hence @xmath168 ) . beyond that maximum",
    ", there is a turning point @xmath169 where the universe stops and reverses its evolution . at the stopping point , @xmath170",
    "this is possible because we can have @xmath171 , or @xmath172 .",
    "the following observation is now in order : notice , from eq.([fosc ] ) , that for @xmath106 ( which implies no running of @xmath124 ) the cosmon energy density is conserved ; so , if in addition @xmath173 ( vanishing current cosmon density ) , we must then have @xmath174 at all times .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath175 we exactly recover the standard @xmath0cdm model . and",
    "it is precisely in this limit that the formula ( [ zs ] ) for the redshift location of the maximum of the ratio @xmath176 ceases to make sense , as it is evident by simple inspection of that formula . in contrast ,",
    "when we make allowance for the parameter space of the @xmath0xcdm model , the maximum does exist and moreover the ratio @xmath176 stays bounded ",
    "typically @xmath177  for the entire history of the universe .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig.3 , for various values of the parameters .",
    "so , in fact , the @xmath0xcdm model can provide a nice solution to the cosmic coincidence problem without necessarily departing from the @xmath0cdm model in a significant way .",
    "furthermore , the detailed analysis of the cosmic perturbations in the @xmath0xcdm model indicate excellent compatibility with the present observational data on structure formation@xcite .",
    "the `` relaxed universe '' is a special realization of the @xmath0xcdm model which points to a more ambitious aim , to wit : solving the `` old cc problem''@xcite , i.e. understanding how the universe could start up its thermal history with a huge value of the initial vacuum energy @xmath16 ( e.g. triggered by a gut with , say @xmath17 gev , presumably responsible for inflation ) and then eventually ended up with its current tiny value @xmath178 gev@xmath179 !",
    "the history of this profound theoretical conundrum , which keeps in check the fundamental physics principles since more than forty years ago , traces back to zeldovich s realization in the late sixties@xcite , that the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields should induce a very large value of the cc .",
    "since then the problem stays with us , unbeaten and virtually invincible .",
    "the `` traditional '' fine - tuning solution @xcite ( i.e. the sheer adjustment by hand of the initial big cc value @xmath22 by a carefully chosen finite `` counterterm '' ) is simply and fully inadmissible , especially at the quantum level  see @xcite ( particularly appendix b of this reference ) for a detailed account .",
    "a much more promising approach , instead , should be to find out a mechanism that neutralizes _ dynamically _ the presence of the initial vacuum energy , @xmath22 , whatever it be its seed value in the early universe .",
    "we will call the cosmological model related to this relaxation mechanism , the `` relaxed universe''@xcite .    as we would like that the expansion of the universe be responsible for the triggering of the relaxation dynamics ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such mechanism should be closely related to the expansion itself , or more precisely , to the interaction governing the expansion , i.e.  _ gravity_. a note of caution , however : although we aim at a modified form of gravity , we can not just content ourselves with a `` late time effect '' ( as usually done in the literature on modified gravity  @xcite ) .",
    "we rather must have a _",
    "persistent _ effect , fully active throughout the _ entire history _ of the universe .",
    "indeed , in order to solve the old cc problem we need that some automatic mechanism sets to work at a time prior to the onset of the radiation epoch  at which time it must cancel most of the value of the original vacuum energy present in the early universe _ and _ , most important , we also need that this cancelation is maintained for the rest of the universe lifetime , leaving a small value today and maybe also in the future .",
    "it is not easy to device such a mechanism , but some ideas on it are briefly explained here ",
    "see @xcite , and specially @xcite , for a detailed account ; and @xcite for alternative forms .",
    "the effective action of the `` relaxed universe '' is proposed in the following way : @xmath180\\,,\\label{eq : cc - relax - action}\\ ] ] in which we have an ( arbitrarily large ) initial vacuum energy @xmath22 , and we have included a functional ( the `` cosmon functional '' ) @xmath181 of the ricci scalar @xmath182 and the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath183 .",
    "the structure of this functional is convenient in order to avoid the presence of ghost degrees of freedom and also to dodge the ostrogradski instability , i.e.  the appearance of vacuum states of negative energy@xcite .",
    "the corresponding ( generalized ) einstein equations read @xmath184\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath185 is the ordinary energy - momentum tensor of the matter fields , and @xmath186 is the new tensor in the field equations associated to the presence of the cosmon functional @xmath187 in the action .",
    "we assume that matter is covariantly conserved , and therefore @xmath186 must also be conserved : @xmath188 .",
    "clearly , our functional constitutes an extension of the einstein - hilbert s action with cc , in which we have added the @xmath189 part .",
    "the next point is to make an appropriate choice for the functional @xmath187 such that it can have a bearing on the cosmological constant problem .",
    "we make the following ansatz : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is a polynomial of the ricci scalar and the gau - bonnet invariant , and @xmath192 are dimensionful parameters to be determined later .",
    "this model is in fact of @xmath0xcdm type , in the sense that the cosmon @xmath145 here is related to the energy density @xmath193 generated by @xmath187 in the effective action , and so @xmath194 plays the role of @xmath195 in the @xmath0xcdm model .",

    "the parallelism with the @xmath0xcdm model becomes even more transparent if we notice that the mixed de energy density defined in ( [ fosc ] ) takes here the form @xmath202 , and is covariantly conserved .",
    "indeed , since @xmath22 is constant , we have @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the effective eos of the cosmon , i.e. the analog of @xmath148 in section [ lxcdmmodel2 ] , except that here @xmath205 is a non - trivial function of the cosmological evolution which is determined by the structure of the cosmon functional ( [ eq :",
    "ffp ] ) .",
    "this is indeed a good example of the situation we have mentioned in section [ lxcdmmodel2 ] , in which we emphasized that the cosmon @xmath145 is _ not _ a fundamental field , but a non - trivial field - theoretical object generated from terms of the effective action of qft in curved space - time . evaluating it in the flrw metric we obtain , for its denominator ( [ eq : defb ] ) : @xmath206^{3}\\,,\\label{eq : b}\\ ] ] where @xmath207 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "the previous formula shows why the cosmon functional ( [ eq : ffp ] ) can provide a dynamical mechanism for counterbalancing the value of @xmath22 , whatever it be its size .",
    "the relaxation of the effective vacuum energy @xmath202 in the radiation epoch originates from the  @xmath208 factor in the denominator ( [ eq : b ] ) of the cosmon functional , as this term grows as @xmath209 at large @xmath19 and dominates @xmath210 in the earlier epochs .",
    "the large  @xmath22 left over in the immediate post - inflationary period drives the deceleration parameter  @xmath211 to larger values until @xmath212 , which corresponds to radiation - like expansion .",
    "in other words , the very existence of the radiation period is triggered automatically by the presence of this term , which can be thought of as a countermeasure launched by the universe against the presence of the large `` residual '' vacuum energy @xmath22 in the pre - radiation era . as a result , @xmath213 is driven _ dynamically _ to very large values , opposite in sign to @xmath22 , and produce a small effective @xmath214 in the radiation epoch , for an appropriate sign of the parameter @xmath215 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath216 factor in the denominator ( [ eq : b ] ) will be responsible for the relaxation in the matter era  ( @xmath217 ) , at lower values of @xmath19 .",
    "this is possible because the term with the @xmath216 factor is weighted by a power of @xmath19 smaller than the term carrying the @xmath208 factor .",
    "the transition between the two regimes ( i.e. from radiation to matter ) is what fixes the parameter @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the hubble rate just at the transition time between the two epochs .    a numerical example illustrating all these features",
    "can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ relaxhistory ] .",
    "the relaxed universe is seen to follow very closely the past history of the standard @xmath0cdm model ( see especially the upper panel in that figure ) , and its effective eos loiters around the @xmath0cdm value @xmath220 near our time ( see the second panel of that figure ) . in the far past , @xmath221 turns out to track the values @xmath222 and @xmath223 in the matter and radiation epochs , respectively .",
    "finally , when the universe leaves the matter epoch @xmath224 , there is a kind of impasse , as there is no longer a special value for @xmath211 to pick dynamically in order to maintain the counterbalance of the large @xmath22 by the cosmon density @xmath194 .",
    "what to do now ? under these circumstances , the last resort of the relaxation mechanism is to enforce ( dynamically ) a very low value of @xmath19 .",
    "since in the current universe we must have @xmath225 , with @xmath226 , it follows that the value of @xmath19 that solves this equation is approximately given by @xmath227 for an appropriate choice of @xmath215 , we may bring @xmath228 close enough to the current value @xmath21 . as @xmath215 has dimension @xmath229 of mass ,",
    "we can rewrite it as @xmath230 .",
    "the relaxation condition requires @xmath231 where @xmath232 .",
    "thus , @xmath233 .",
    "taking the standard gut scale @xmath17 gev , we obtain @xmath234 in the ballpark of a light neutrino mass : @xmath235 incidentally , this value for @xmath236 is the geometric mean of the two most extreme mass scales available in our universe below the planck mass .",
    "it is rewarding to see that we do not obtain an extremely small mass scale of order @xmath237 ev , as in the case of quintessence models .    from the above considerations , we see that the @xmath197-functional s main mission is to _ dynamically _ counterbalance the big initial @xmath22 at _ all epochs _ , not just now ; and in the last stage of this dynamical process the hubble rate is driven to the very small value @xmath21 that we observe today . at the end of the day",
    ", what we get is not just a late time effect of the cosmological evolution ( as in the traditional modified gravity models ) , but rather a truly perennial large scale influence on all periods of the cosmic history .",
    "one hope is that a relaxation mechanism of this sort should ultimate provide a dynamical solution to the tough fine tuning problem underlying the `` old cc problem''@xcite .",
    "for example , in the standard model of electroweak interactions such fine - tuning involves @xmath238 decimal places , at least , and it must be retuned order by order in perturbation theory until reaching loop diagrams of order 20th !",
    "@xcite for details . in the relaxed universe , in contrast",
    ", the tuning to all orders is automatic and performed dynamically by the universe s expansion .",
    "this is why such field - theoretical object associated to the functional @xmath197 is called the `` cosmon '' , as its primary mission is to compensate for the huge initial cc throughout the entire cosmological evolution .",
    "clearly , it has the same aim as the cosmon scalar field first introduced in @xcite , except that here the cosmon has nothing to do with scalar fields , and moreover is _ not _ subdued by weiberg s `` no - go '' theorem ",
    "see@xcite for a more detailed account .",
    "while in the present version the cosmon is not a fundamental quintessence field@xcite , it can perfectly mimic quintessence - like behavior ( cf .",
    "[ relaxhistory ] ) .",
    "the new cosmon , however , is a more complex object : it is a functional whose ultimate origin must be provided by a fundamental theory ( say string theory or any other theory aiming at a final explanation of quantum gravity ) . in the meanwhile ,",
    "what we have shown here is a practical working example , actually a class of such functionals which are able to truly adjust the vacuum energy dynamically , whatever it be its initial value , and without performing fine - tuning at any stage of the cosmological evolution .",
    "as this was the main aim of the original cosmon model@xcite , it is naturally suggested that the general class of these functionals is called the `` new cosmon '' . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that the relaxed universe based on the cosmon functional ( [ eq : ffp ] ) and extensions thereof ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) , provides also a possible natural solution to the cosmic coincidence problem ( mentioned in section[lxcdmmodel2 ] ) .",
    "this additional bonus is not too surprising if we recall that the relaxed universe is a particular implementation of the class of @xmath0xcdm models of the cosmic evolution@xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned that , in the relaxed universe , there is a tracking behavior of matter / radiation and de during the @xmath239 ( radiation ) and @xmath240 ( matter epochs ) . however , when the matter epoch is left behind and the relaxation mechanism is enforced ( dynamically ) to pick a very small value of @xmath19 ( as we have seen above ) in order to insure the condition @xmath241 to hold , this crucial event decoupled once and forever the tracking behaviors of matter / radiation and de , and since then the de dominates the universe s expansion . such breakdown of the tracking property at the end of the matter epoch , on the other hand , pushed the subdominant de density curve upwards until crossing the decaying dm one at some point after the matter epoch and hence near our time .",
    "this feature , which can be very well appreciated in fig .",
    "[ relaxhistory ] ( cf .",
    "third panel ) , encodes the very origin and the possible exciting explanation ( within the relaxed universe ) of the `` coincidence @xmath242 '' of the matter and de densities in our late time neighborhood . not only so : we can also understand now the smallness of both @xmath243 and @xmath21 in front of the huge initial vacuum energy density @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , from ( [ hstar ] ) we predict @xmath244 gev , for @xmath234 not far from the @xmath245mev scale , which is the mass scale itself of the current cc : @xmath246 ev .",
    "we have thus arrived at a most natural scenario ( `` the relaxed universe '' ) in which , at variance with the quintessence formulation of the de , there is no need to severely fine - tune any parameter of the model , and moreover it is not required the existence of any extremely tiny mass scale .",
    "we have shown that models with variable vacuum energy @xmath28 ( and may be also with variable @xmath24 ) generally lead to a non - trivial effective eos when viewed from the point of view of a self - conserved de fluid at fixed @xmath24 . as a result",
    ", these models can effectively appear as quintessence , and even as phantom energy , without need of invoking the existence of fundamental quintessence and phantom fields . combining a time - evolving @xmath28 with a variable `` cosmon '' energy density @xmath195 ( in general _",
    "not _ representing any scalar field ) , we obtain the class of @xmath0xcdm models , which are able to deal with the cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "finally , one can provide a version of the @xmath0xcdm model in which the new cosmon stands for a self - adjusting functional , namely one which is able to counteract the effects of an arbitrarily large cc in the early universe , leaving a small and completely innocuous net value of the cc at any stage of the cosmological evolution , in particular the tiny value @xmath14 gev@xmath15 that we observe at present .",
    "this particular cosmon functional is thus able to reduce the value of the cc _ without fine - tuning _ , and may be eligible as a prototype model ( `` the relaxed universe '' ) for eventually solving the old cc problem .",
