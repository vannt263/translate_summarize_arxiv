    "in multiple input and multiple output ( mimo ) systems , channel adaptive techniques ( e.g. , water - filling , interference alignment , beamforming , etc . ) can enhance the spectral efficiency or the capacity of the system .",
    "however , these channel adaptive techniques require accurate channel conditions , often referred to channel state information ( csi ) . oftentimes , in a frequency - division duplex ( fdd ) setting , csi is estimated at the receiver and conveyed to the transmitter via a feedback channel . in recent years",
    ", csi feedback problems have been intensively studied , due to its potential benefits to the mimo systems @xcite .",
    "it is significant to explore how to reduce the feedback load , due to the uplink feedback channel limitation .    in @xcite ,",
    "four feedback rate reduction approaches were reviewed , where the lossy compression using the properties of the fading process was considered best .",
    "when the wireless channel experiences temporal - correlated fading , modeled as a finite - state markov chain , the amount of csi feedback bits can be reduced by ignoring the states occurring with small probabilities @xcite .",
    "the feedback rate in frequency - selective fading channels was studied in @xcite , by exploiting the frequency correlation .    in summary , all the above works mainly focus on feedback rate compression considering either temporal correlation or spectral correlation .",
    "however , doubly selective fading channels are more frequently encountered in wireless communications as the desired data rate and mobility grow simultaneously . to the best knowledge of the authors , the scheme of making full use of the two - dimensional correlations",
    "is not yet well studied . using both of the orthogonal dimensional correlations in a cooperated way",
    ", the feedback overhead can be further reduced in the doubly selective fading channels .",
    "thus , in this paper , we derive the minimal feedback rate using both the temporal and spectral correlations .",
    "the main contributions of the present paper can be briefly summarized as:1 ) we discuss the minimal feedback rate without differential feedback .",
    "2 ) we propose a differential feedback scheme by exploiting the temporal and spectral correlations , and 3 ) we derive the minimal differential feedback rate expression over mimo doubly selective fading channel .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii , we describe the differential feedback model as well as the statistics of the doubly selective fading channel . in section  iii ,",
    "we propose a differential feedback scheme by exploiting the two - dimensional correlations and derive the minimal feedback rate . in section",
    "iv , we provide some simulation results showing the performance of the proposed scheme .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the down - link channel is a mobile wireless channel which is always correlated in time and frequency domains , while the up - link channel is a limited feedback channel .      since the channel corresponding to each antenna is independent and with the same statistics , we can describe the separation property of the channel frequency response @xmath0 at time @xmath1 for an arbitrary transmit and receive antenna pair  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes expectation function , the superscript @xmath4 denotes complex conjugate .",
    "@xmath5 is the power of the channel frequency response . @xmath6 and @xmath7 denotes the temporal and spectral correlation functions , respectively .    assuming that the channel frequency response stays constant within the symbol period @xmath8 and the subchannel spacing @xmath9 , the correlation function for different periods and subchannels is written as @xmath10 = \\sigma_h^2 { r_t}\\left [ \\delta m \\right]{r_f}\\left[\\delta",
