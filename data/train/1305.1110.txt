    "the light - matter interaction is one of the fundamental problems investigated in many aspects of modern physics ranging from quantum optics to quantum information processing and to condensed matter physics .",
    "the simple description of quantum light - matter interaction , namely the interaction of a qubit with a harmonic oscillator , is given by rabi model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , this simple model has been recently used to describe many physical phenomena , such as an electron coupled to a phonon mode  @xcite , an atom interacting with an electromagnetic field in a cavity  @xcite , a superconducting qubit interacting with a nanomechanical resonator  @xcite , a transmission line resonator  @xcite or an lc circuit  @xcite , etc  @xcite . due to the excitation non - conserving nature of the rabi model ,",
    "it is hard to obtain an elegant formula for its eigen - spectrum ; only recently braak was given the spectrum in terms of a solution of a transcendental equation with a single variable  @xcite .",
    "for the weak atom - field coupling regime and the nearly resonant condition , it is legitimate to drop the excitation non - conserving terms , the so - called counter - rotating terms , in the atom - field interaction .",
    "this approximation is known as rotating wave approximation  ( rwa ) and has been well applied recently in most optical settings both experimentally and theoretically . under rwa",
    ", rabi model reduces to jaynes - cummings model  @xcite which is exactly solvable . on the other hand , with the recent technological advances in the circuit and cavity qed systems  @xcite",
    ", it is now possible to engineer the strong atom - field couplings which makes crucial to consider the effects of counter - rotating terms on the dynamics of atom - field systems .    in the present study",
    ", we consider a model of two noninteracting qubits strongly coupled to a harmonic oscillator in a dissipative cavity .",
    "our main focus is to investigate the effects of counter - rotating terms on the dissipative dynamics of entanglement between one of the atom and the cavity mode by using the recently derived lindblad type quantum optical master equation  @xcite which is adapted to the strong - coupling regime under born and markov approximations .",
    "the entanglement between atoms in the same setting has been recently investigated by many groups in the strong - coupling regime by using different master equation approaches  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the entanglement between the atoms displays richer dynamical features in comparison to the rwa one .",
    "in particular , counter - rotating terms are found to lead to steady state entanglement between the atoms even for the initial states  ( including vacuum state ) that have no overlap with the decoherence free subspace of the system  @xcite .",
    "different from the previous studies  @xcite , we focus on the entanglement for atom - field system in the strong - coupling regime . under rwa conditions ,",
    "even the entanglement between the atoms can reach a high non - zero value in the long - time limit for certain initial states , the cavity mode always becomes separable from the atoms in the steady states . by using monogamic relation for entanglement of formation  ( eof )  @xcite as well as the lower bound of eof for bipartite mixed states in higher dimensions  @xcite , contrary to the rwa case",
    ", we show that the atom - field system in the steady states can become entangled in the strong - coupling regime and the entanglement can grow as a function of atom - field coupling constant .",
    "the rabi hamiltonian that describes the strong interaction of two identical qubits  ( a and b ) with a quantized cavity field f can be written as  ( @xmath0 )  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 is the qubit transition ( cavity field ) frequency , @xmath4 @xmath5 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity field , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the pauli matrix in the @xmath8 @xmath9 direction and @xmath10 is the coupling constant between the atom and the cavity field .",
    "the terms , @xmath11 , in the interaction part of the hamiltonian are called counter - rotating terms  ( crts ) and they do not conserve the excitation number ; even the atoms and the field are initially in their ground states , the time evolution of the mean excitation number is nonzero  @xcite . on the other hand , in the weak - coupling regime where",
    "@xmath12 , the effects of crts are negligible and these terms can be dropped from the hamiltonian .",
    "this approximation is known as rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) which leads to two - qubit jaynes - cummings hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the photon loss due to the imperfections of the cavity mirrors should be taken into account . under born and markov approximations  , the non - unitary dynamics of atoms - field system",
    "is generally represented by the `` _ standard _ ''",
    "lindblad master equation : @xmath14+\\kappa d[a]\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15\\rho=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(2m\\rho m^{\\dagger}-\\rho m^{\\dagger}m - m^{\\dagger}m\\rho\\right)$ ] , @xmath16 is the atoms - field density matrix and @xmath17 is the photon leakage rate . in the weak atom - field coupling regime",
    "where rwa can be applied  ( eq .  ( [ jch ] ) ) , the master equation  ( [ slme ] ) has been well studied and can be used accurately to describe many cavity and circuit qed systems .",
    "contrary to the numerous investigations of the master equation  ( [ slme ] ) in the strong atom - field coupling regime by using rabi hamiltonian  ( [ rh ] ) in an _ ad hoc _ manner  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , it is , in fact , at the root of unphysical effects  @xcite ; it creates excess photons in atom - field system and produces spurious qubit flipping .",
    "the main reason of the unphysical predictions obtained from standard lindblad master equation in the strong - coupling regime is to neglect the qubit - field interaction  ( @xmath18 ) while deriving the dissipator part of eq .",
    "( [ slme ] ) .",
    "although the error introduced by the approximation  ( @xmath18 ) is negligible under rwa , the qubit - field interaction becomes influential in the strong - coupling regime and causes the unphysical effects .",
    "recently , a new lindblad master equation , which carefully considers the transitions among the eigenstates of the rabi hamiltonian  ( [ rh ] ) , has been given  @xcite .",
    "it can be written as  @xcite : @xmath19+\\displaystyle\\sum_{j , k > j}\\gamma_{\\kappa}^{jk}d\\left[\\left|j\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle k\\right|\\right]\\rho,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 are the relaxation coefficients  @xcite , @xmath21 and @xmath22 define the spectrum of the hamiltonian  ( [ rh ] ) i.e. , @xmath23 and the eigenstates should be labeled according to increasing energy  ( label @xmath21 such that @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) .",
    "also , note that as @xmath18 , the standard dissipator  ( [ slme ] ) can be recovered from eq .",
    "( [ ilme ] ) . here",
    ", we call the equation  ( [ ilme ] ) as the `` _ improved _ '' lindblad master equation which , indeed , cures the unphysical effects originated from the use of the _ ad hoc _ master equation  ( [ slme ] ) in the strong atom - field coupling regime  @xcite .    for the numerical solution of the master equation  ( [ ilme ] ) with rabi model , we have considered basis vectors of type @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the excited and ground states of the qubit and @xmath28 .",
    "the field fock space is truncated for large enough @xmath29 until the results converge  @xcite . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will consider the resonant case , @xmath30 , and the field initially prepared in its ground state @xmath31 .",
    "now , we investigate the dissipative dynamics of entanglement between one of the atom ( say a ) and the cavity mode f in the strong - coupling regime . the reduced density matrix of a - f system can be obtained by taking a partial trace of @xmath16 over the remaining part b : @xmath32 . in practice",
    ", the considered system has a dimension of ( @xmath33 ) . since we apply a convergence criteria to the field fock space to solve the master equation  ( [ ilme ] )",
    ", the atom - field system becomes a qubit - qudit ( @xmath34 ) system .",
    "entangled states are vital for many quantum computation and communication protocols . entanglement of formation  ( eof ) is one of the meaningful and physically motivated measure of entanglement . for two - qubit states",
    ", eof can be calculated directly through the entanglement monotone , concurrence  @xcite . for higher dimensional bipartite mixed states , except for some special cases  -dimensional bipartite mixed states reduced from tripartite ( @xmath35 ) pure states  @xcite which will be discussed later in the text . ] , the evaluation of eof is a formidable task which can require highly complex optimization process .",
    "therefore , recent efforts have led to several bounds to estimate the amount of entanglement in high dimensional quantum systems  @xcite . in the present study , we will use recently proposed the lower bound of eof  @xcite to estimate the amount of entanglement for the atom - field states in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "its definition is based on the comparison of two strong separability criteria : the positive partial transpose and the realignment criteria .",
    "it was shown that eof is tightly bounded for qubit - qudit system as  @xcite : @xmath36 $ & if $ \\lambda \\in \\left [ 1 , 2 \\right],$\\end{tabular}\\right . \\label{lbeof}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the trace norm .",
    "the matrix @xmath40 is the partial transpose with respect to the subsystem a. @xmath41 is , in fact , sufficient for separability of bipartite ( @xmath42 ) and ( @xmath43 ) states .",
    "@xmath44 is the realigned version of @xmath45  @xcite and is another operational criteria for separability which satisfies @xmath46 for any bipartite separable state @xmath47 .",
    "we first investigate the dissipative dynamics of entanglement between the atom a and cavity mode f under rwa conditions .",
    "the dynamics of atoms - field system with cavity decay under rwa given by eq .",
    "( [ slme ] ) have been throughly investigated , recently  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the atoms - field steady states have a simple structure determined solely by the overlap of atomic initial state with the subradiant state  ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "more precisely , the cavity decay tends to drive the atoms - field system to the ground state  ( @xmath48 ) of @xmath49 . on the other hand , the population of the subradiant state , @xmath50 , given by @xmath51 does not decay in the evolution process .",
    "therefore , the atoms - field system is driven to a mixed state involving only the two decoherence free subspaces  ( dfs ) : the ground state , @xmath48 , and the dark state , @xmath52 .",
    "depending on the atomic initial state  .",
