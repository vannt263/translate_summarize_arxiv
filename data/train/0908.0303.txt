    "the superconductivity in iron pnictides @xcite and chalcogenides @xcite , with the interactions resulting from charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons delicately balanced @xcite , provide a unique opportunity to unravel the mystery of unconventional superconductivity @xcite . from the experimental characterizations @xcite of the superconducting state of the iron pnictides and chalcogenides as well as theoretical calculations @xcite , it seems clear that the superconductivity in these alloys is not mediated by the phonons @xcite .",

    "the recently discovered , superconducting iron pnictides and chalcogenides , fese and its alloys with one of the simplest crystal structure are well - suited for such a study .    in fese ,",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 of @xmath2 k @xcite , increases up to @xmath3 k with s and te substitutions @xcite but decreases rapidly with electron doping using co , ni and cu substitutions @xcite . the presence of excess fe as well as the se deficiency in fese is known to affect its superconducting properties @xcite .",

    "previous theoretical attempts @xcite at understanding the changes in the normal state electronic properties , as a prelude to understanding the changes in their superconducting properties , of several of the pnictides and chalcogenides upon alloying have used either virtual - crystal or the supercell or a series of ordered alloys or parametrized model hamiltonian approach .",
