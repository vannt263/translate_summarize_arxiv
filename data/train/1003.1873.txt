    "according to the bardeen , cooper and schrieffer @xcite theory of superconductivity in conventional metals and their alloys the superconducting condensate consists of singlet cooper pairs .",
    "these pairs can be described by a wave function @xmath11 which is in the absence of the condensate flow symmetric in the momentum space ( @xmath12-wave singlet pairing ) . in terms of the creation and annihilation operators",
    "@xmath13 this function can be represented in the form of a thermodynamic average @xmath14 at equal times ( @xmath15 ) this function determines the order parameter @xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coupling constant of an attractive interaction@xmath19the spin - independent scattering by ordinary impurities does not affect this type of superconductivity ( anderson - theorem ) @xcite .    in the last two decades",
    "other types of superconductivity have been discovered .",
    "the most important example is high @xmath20 superconductivity discovered by bednorz and mller @xcite in cuprates .    as a result of intensive study of these superconductors",
    ", it was demonstrated that , although the cooper pairs in this case are also singlet , their wave function essentially depends on the momentum @xmath21 and changes sign with varying momentum direction in @xmath22 planes . in the simplest version ,",
    "the dependence of the order parameter @xmath23 on @xmath21 has the form : @xmath24 ( @xmath25-wave singlet pairing ) .",
    "such a dependence @xmath26 allows one to construct the so called @xmath27josephson junction consisting of single crystals of high t@xmath28 superconductors with an appropriate orientation of these crystals with respect to each other @xcite .",
    "the ground state of this junction corresponds to the phase difference equal to @xmath29 .",
    "another type of superconductivity ( triplet ) has been discovered in strontium ruthinate @xmath30 @xcite and in heavy fermion intermetallic compounds @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the singlet superconductivity , the wave function of the cooper pairs @xmath31 is an odd function of momentum @xmath32 , so that for equal times @xmath15 the function @xmath33 and the order parameter @xmath26 do not equal to zero ( @xmath34-wave triplet pairing ) . only for some directions of the momentum",
    "@xmath35 the order parameter turns to zero .",
    "this means that , in agreement with the pauli principle , the pair wave function changes sign under permutation of spins and momenta .",
    "the momentum dependence of the condensate function makes the singlet @xmath25-wave and triplet @xmath21-wave superconductivity sensitive to scattering even by potential ( not acting on spin ) impurities .",
    "an unusual mechanism of superfluidity was proposed by berezinsky @xcite .",
    "having in mind liquid @xmath36 , he considered a retarded interaction between atoms and assumed that the order parameter @xmath37 and the wave functions @xmath38 or @xmath39 in the matsubara representation were even functions of momentum but odd function of the matsubara frequency @xmath40 .",
    "however , experiments on superfluid @xmath36 revealed that the @xmath21-wave triplet type of the superfluidity is realized in @xmath41 rather than the one proposed by berezinsky @xcite . some possibilities to realize the exotic berezinsky - type mechanism of superconductivity in various systems in context of the pairing mechanism in high @xmath20 superconductors",
    "were considered in refs.kirkpatrick,coleman,abrahams .",
    "this exotic type of superconductivity ( or superfluidity ) was regarded for quite a long time as a hypothetical one .",
    "only recently it has been realized @xcite that the odd triplet superconductivity might exist in a simple  sf bilayer system consisting of a conventional  @xmath12-wave singlet bcs - type superconductor s and a ferromagnetic layer f with a nonhomogeneous magnetization @xmath42    to that moment it had already been well known that in an sf system with a homogeneous magnetization @xmath2 the cooper pairs penetrated the ferromagnet over a short length @xmath43 ( in the diffusive limit ) , where @xmath44 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath45 is the mean free path , and @xmath46 is the exchange energy in the ferromagnet ( we set the planck constant @xmath47 equal to @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the exchange energy usually is much larger than the critical temperature of the superconductor @xmath20 , the length @xmath49 is much shorter than the length of the condensate penetration into a normal metal in an sn bilayer : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the cooper pairs penetrating the ferromagnet with an uniform magnetization consist of electrons with opposite spins .",
    "their wave function is however the sum of a singlet and triplet component with zero total spin projection on the @xmath50-axis ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the exchange field mixes these components and the triplet component with @xmath6 is unavoidable in the ferromagnet . the sum of these two components can be considered as a short - range component ( src ) .    the part corresponding the triplet @xmath6 component has the form @xmath51 . at equal times @xmath15",
    "this function equals zero in agreement with the pauli principle .",
    "therefore the function @xmath52 is an odd function of the time difference @xmath53 or @xmath40 in the matsubara representation .",
    "the order parameter in the superconductor s is related only to the singlet function @xmath54 which is an even function of @xmath55 the superconducting order parameter in f is zero if the coupling constant @xmath56 in the cooper channel equals zero .",
    "the situation changes if the magnetization orientation in the vicinity of the sf interface is not fixed .",
    "this case was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an sf bilayer with a domain wall located at the sf interface was considered .",
    "it was shown that in such a system not only the singlet and triplet @xmath6 components but also the odd triplet component with @xmath57 arises in the ferromagnet .",
    "the latter component penetrates the superconductor over a large distance that does not depend on the exchange field and is of the order @xmath58 provided the spin - dependent scattering is not too strong .",
    "this odd triplet component can be considered as the long - range triplet component ( lrtc ) .",
    "as the lrtc is symmetric in the momentum space , the scattering by potential impurities does not affect this component .    in subsequent theoretical papers various types of sf structures where the lrtc may arise were studied ( see review articles bvermp , buzdinrmp , eschrigrev and references therein ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the creation of the lrtc is predicted in a diffusive sf structure with a bloch - type domain wall ( dw ) .",
    "the width of the dw , @xmath59 was assumed to be larger than the mean free path @xmath60",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62    a more general case of the dw with a width , arbitrary with respect to the mean free path , in a sf structure with an arbitrary impurity concentration was studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "the lrtc in diffusive sf structures with a neel - type dws has been analyzed in ref .",
    "the case of a half - metallic ferromagnet in sf or sfs structures was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . braude and",
    "nazarov @xcite studied the lrtc in sf structures with a highly transparent sf interfaces so that the amplitude of the condensate functions induced in the ferromagnet was not small ( strong proximity effect ) .",
    "ballistic sf structures with a nonhomogeneous magnetization , where the lrtc could be created , were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . the papers vae06,champel08,annett , sudbosp were devoted to the study of the lrtc in spiral ferromagnets attached to superconductors .    in several papers @xcite the lrtc",
    "was investigated in sf structures with the so - called spin - active interfaces . in the approach used in these papers ,",
    "the properties of the sf interface are characterized by a scattering matrix with elements considered as phenomenological parameters . in this approach",
    "one does not need knowing the detailed structure of the sf interface and can proceed calculating physical quantities using these parameters . * *  * * we will see that even in the framework of the quasiclassical theory one can obtain effective boundary conditions for the lrtc provided the width of the dw @xmath63 attached at the sf interface is thin enough ( such an approach was used in ref .",
    "ve08 ) . from the physical point of view the region with a narrow dw can be regarded as a spin - active sf interface .",
    "if the width @xmath63 is comparable with the fermi wave length , one has to go beyond the quasiclassical theory and derive the boundary conditions from the first principles ( see @xcite as well as @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "by now , several papers presenting a quite convincing experimental evidence in favor of the existence of the lrtc have been published petrashov , klapwijk , birge , aarts10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the conductance of a spiral ferromagnet ( @xmath64 ) attached to two superconductors was measured .",
    "it was concluded that the conductance variation below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath20 is too large to be explained in terms of the singlet component .",
    "keizer et al .",
    "@xcite observed the josephson effect in an sfs junction with a half - metallic ferromagnet @xmath65 .",
    "the thickness of the f layer was much larger ( up to @xmath661 mkm ) than the penetration depth of the short range condensate components .",
    "moreover , in the metal where free electrons with only one spin direction are allowed , no pairs with opposite spins are possible .",
    "therefore , only triplet @xmath9 component can survive in this ferromagnet @xcite . however , there is no controllable parameter in this system that would allow one to change the amplitude of the lrtc .",
    "a similar long - range josephson effect in a sfs junction with @xmath65 as a ferromagnetic layer was observed by anwar et al . in a recent work @xcite .",
    "recently the dc long - range josepshon effect has been observed in a more complicated sfs structure with a controllable parameter @xcite . in the experimental setup of this work ,",
    "f was not a single ferromagnetic layer but a multilayered structure of the nfnfnfn type , where n is a nonmagnetic metal , f is a weak ferromagnet ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) and f is a strong ferromagnet ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the middle f layer was in its turn a trilayer structure consisting of two f layers with antiparallel orientation of magnetization @xmath2 and of a thin layer ( @xmath70 ) that provides rkky coupling between the f layers .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite measured the josephson critical current @xmath71 for different thicknesses",
    "@xmath72 of the f and f layers ( we denote the thicknesses of the f and f layers as @xmath73 and @xmath4 layers respectively ) . it was demonstrated that in the absence of the f layers ( @xmath74 ) the critical current @xmath75 was negligible if the width of the f layer @xmath4 essentially exceeded the small length @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the exchange energy in the f layer .",
    "this is what one expects for the conventional superconductivity .",
    "however , adding the f layers resulted in an increase of the critical current @xmath75 by several orders .",
    "the dependence of @xmath76 is non - monotonous : the critical current is small at small and large @xmath73 reaching a maximum at @xmath77 .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite suggested an explanation of these results in terms of the lrtc .",
    "note that the mean free path @xmath78 in the structure studied in ref.@xcite is rather short ( the diffusive limit in the f layers and an intermediate case in the f layer ) .",
    "theoretically the dc josephson effect in multilayered sfs junctions with a non - collinear magnetization orientation has been studied in several works . in refs . @xcite the josephson current in ballistic sfs junctions was calculated .",
    "the diffusive sff s junctions were considered in refs .",
    "however the long - range josephson effect in the junctions with two f layers is not possible ; the josephson critical current @xmath71 is not exponentially small only if the total thickness of the ferromagnetic layer , @xmath79 , is comparable with the short length @xmath49 : @xmath80    the diffusive josephson junctions with three ferromagnetic layers and non - collinear @xmath2 orientation , where the long - range josephson coupling may exist , have been analyzed in refs . @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite considered the fsfsfstructure with different magnetization @xmath2 orientations in the f and f layers . in ref .",
    "buzdinhouzet a somewhat different , but more suitable for experimental realization , sfff s structure with different @xmath2 directions in the f and f parts was analyzed .",
    "in both papers the exchange energy in the f and f was assumed to be equal .",
    "the amplitude of the lrtc , @xmath81 and the josephson critical current due to this component @xmath82  are calculated in both works .",
    "although the structures studied in refs .",
    "@xcite are different , the results obtained are similar . the final formula for the critical current can be written in both the cases as @xmath83    in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , @xmath84 are angles between the @xmath50-axis and the magnetization vectors in the left ( right ) f layers , while the magnetization @xmath2 in the f layer is assumed to be parallel to the @xmath50-axis .",
    "the function @xmath85 is a non - monotonic function with a maximum at @xmath77 .",
    "this function vanishes at small and large thickness @xmath73 of the f layers ( see eq . ( 12 ) in ref . @xcite and fig . 2 in ref .",
    "buzdinhouzet ) .",
    "qualitatively , this prediction agrees with the observations in ref .",
    "however , experimental parameters presented in this publication are well defined and this makes a more detailed comparison of the theoretical predictions for ltrc with the experimental results quite interesting .    in this paper",
    "we analyze an sfff s structure which , being formally similar to that considered by houzet and buzdin @xcite , is in many respects different and closer to the structure studied experimentally .",
    "first , unlike ref.@xcite , we assume that the exchange energies in the f and f layers ( @xmath86 an @xmath1 respectively ) are different .",
    "secondly , we assume that the sf interface is not perfect and the proximity effect is weak .",
    "this assumption allows us to linearize the usadel equation and to calculate the critical josephson current @xmath75 at any temperatures @xmath87 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite only the case of temperatures close to @xmath88 was considered ) .",
    "thirdly , we also analyze the case when the f layer consists of two domains with parallel and antiparallel orientations of magnetization .    at last , we derive a formula for the current @xmath75 for arbitrary thicknesses , @xmath89 , of the f and f layers ( in ref .",
    "@xcite a formula for @xmath75 is presented only in the limit @xmath90 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ basic ] we formulate the problem and write down necessary equations . in section",
    "[ thin ] we analyze the case of thin f layers ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "we calculate the amplitudes of the short range singlet and triplet @xmath6 components as well as the lrtc . in section",
    "[ arbitrary ] the case of arbitrary lengths @xmath91 will be considered under assumption that the angles @xmath84 are small . using the formulas obtained for the amplitudes of different components , we calculate in section [ current ] the critical current @xmath92 in the limiting cases : a ) for parallel and antiparallel @xmath2 orientations in the f layer and for arbitrary angles @xmath84 assuming that the thickness @xmath73 is small , b ) for arbitrary @xmath89 under assumption of small @xmath84 .",
    "the results obtained are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider a multi - layer s / f josephson junction shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "it consists of two superconductors , s , and three ferromagnetic layers f , f@xmath93 .",
    "the middle f layer may consist of two domains or layers with parallel or antiparallel orientations of the magnetization @xmath2 .",
    "a similar josephson junction has been studied experimentally in a recent work @xcite .",
    "the presence of normal n layers in the experimental s / nf@xmath94nfnf@xmath95n / s structures can not change qualitatively the results for the s / f@xmath94ff@xmath96s structure obtained here because the scattering in the n layers does not depend on spin ( if a weak spin - orbit scattering can be neglected ) .",
    "therefore , all the superconducting components , singlet and triplet , decay in the n layers in a similar way over a large distance of the order @xmath58 .",
    "the exchange fields acting on electron spins are @xmath86 in the f@xmath97 layers and @xmath1 in the middle f layer .",
    "the magnetization vector @xmath98 in f is supposed to align along the z - axis and it has the components @xmath99 in the f@xmath100 layers .",
    "the magnetization in the f layer is oriented along the @xmath50-axis but may have parallel or antiparallel orientations in the regions ( @xmath101 ) and ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "for explicit calculations we use the quasiclassical  green s function technique , which is the most efficient tool for studying sf structures ( see reviews @xcite ) , and assume that all the ferromagnetic layers are in the diffusive regime , so that the usadel equation can be used .",
    "the amplitude of the condensate wave function in the ferromagnetic layers is assumed to be small ( weak proximity effect ) and therefore the usadel equation can be linearized .",
    "the smallness of the condensate wave function is either due to a mismatch of the fermi velocities in s and f or due to the presence of a tunnel barrier at the s / f interfaces .",
    "the anomalous ( gorkov ) quasiclassical green s function in the considered case of a spin - dependent interaction is a @xmath103 matrix @xmath104 .",

    "the @xmath123 matrices are matrices in the particle - hole space .",
    "the first term is the short range triplet component with the zero projection of the total spin on the z - axis , the second term is the lrtc with the non - zero projection of the total spin , and the third term is the singlet component of the condensate green s function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( [ usadel ] ) should be complemented by boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the simplest model of the s / f heterostructures assuming that the interfaces have no effect on spins ( spin - passive interface ) .",
    "these boundary conditions have the form @xcite",
    "@xmath124    where @xmath125 is the s / f interface resistance per unit area , @xmath126 is the conductivity of the ferromagnet .",

    "in particular , the coefficient @xmath132 becomes a matrix with matrix elements containing very often unknown phenomenological parameters .",
    "such interfaces are called spin - active interfaces . in many papers",
    "the lrtc is studied in sf systems with spin - active interfaces @xcite .",
    "the f / f@xmath100 interfaces are assumed to be ideal and therefore the function @xmath133 and its derivative @xmath134 must be continuous at these interfaces . solving the linear equation ( usadel ) with the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] )",
    "one can calculate the dc josephson current using the formula @xcite    @xmath135    this problem can be solved in a general case of an arbitrary thicknesses of the f and f layers ( @xmath4 and @xmath73 ) and angles @xmath84 .",
    "however , the general results are too cumbersome . in order to present analytical formulas in a more or less compact form",
    ", we consider two limiting cases : a ) thin f@xmath100 layers ( @xmath136 ) and arbitrary angles @xmath137 , b ) arbitrary thicknesses @xmath138 , but small angles @xmath137 ( @xmath139 ) . in the next section we consider the case a ) .",
