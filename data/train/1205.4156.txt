    "it has been well - known that the high - energy scattering processes , such as the inclusive or exclusive production ones , are very useful tools to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . in such processes , the drell - yan ( dy ) one for instance , the scattering amplitudes consist of short and long range qcd interactions simultaneously . by the virtue of the factorization theorem ,",
    "the first can be studied via perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , whereas one is able to investigate the second , that signals the nontrivial structures of the hadrons involved , by various nonperturbative approaches .",
    "note that those nonperturbative quantities can be defined by the parton - distribution amplitude ( pda ) , parton - distribution function ( pdf ) , fragmentation function ( ff ) , generalized parton - distribution function ( gpd ) , and so on , depending on different scattering processes . among them , pdfs for the pseudoscalar ( ps ) mesons , @xmath4 , are of importance to understand the nonperturbative structure of the mesons , which play a crucial role in the low - energy qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite , employing the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , pdf and valance - quark distribution function ( vqdf ) for the pion and kaon were derived from the forward scattering amplitude of a virtual photon from a pion target in the bjorken limit .",
    "the obtained results at a low renormalization scale @xmath0 gev were evolved to a high @xmath2 by using the altarelli - parisi equation .",
    "similarly , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the su(3 ) njl model was applied for pdf for the pion , kaon and eta mesons with scalar and pseudoscalar couplings .",
    "they obtained , in the chiral limit , the simple result @xmath5 for the structure functions , satisfying the gauge invariance for the vector current . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the chiral quark model ( chqm ) was used for the pion pdf , resulting in that the pauli - villars regularization scheme is most suitable for both the anomaly structure of qcd and the leading scaling behavior of pdf in the bjorken limit .",
    "the pion pdf was computed using the instanton - liquid model , suggesting an analytic expression for a general vertex function and satisfying , in a gauge invariant approach  @xcite .",
    "the njl - jet model was also employed to compute pdf as well as ff by the cut diagrams in ref .",
    "a parameter - free prediction for the ratio @xmath6 was given in ref .",
    "@xcite using the rainbow - ladder truncation for the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) equations , reproducing the dy data .",
    "extraction of the pion pdf was performed in a next - to - leading order analysis from fermilab e-615 pionic dy data , observing that the high-@xmath7 dependence is different from that of the leading order analysis , whereas it does not match with the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and ds calculations  @xcite .",
    "the lowest three non - trivial moments , calculated by the lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) simulation , were in good agreement with existing data at the physical pion mass  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - flavor wilson - fermion was used for lqcd simulation , observing smallness of relevant moments in comparison with other theoretical models .",
    "using qcd sum rules , the pion pdf was investigated taking into account the nonlocal condensates , paying attention on the bilocal power corrections  @xcite . in the previous works",
    "@xcite , we also computed unpolarized ff first then converted it into pdf by using the drell - levi - yan ( dly ) relation  @xcite , employing the simplified nonlocal chiral - quark model ( nlchqm ) , although this duality or analytic continuation according to the dly relation is not generally satisfied especially for @xmath8-odd pdfs .",
    "the numerical results turned out to be compatible with available empirical data after the dgalp ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) evolution for high-@xmath2 values .",
    "we note that , although the previous works showed qualitatively reasonable results for pdf and ff  @xcite , from a theoretical point of view , there were some issues to be improved : 1 ) the vector - current conservation ( or gauge invariance ) of the matrix element for pdf was not taken into account , i.e. only the simple _ local _ contribution was computed .",
    "2 ) moreover , the numerical calculations were simplified to a certain extent by assuming that the constituent - quark masses inside the relevant matrix element for pdf are constant , not momentum dependent , except for the quark - ps - meson couplings , although this simplification helps to understand the analytic structure of pdf in the model and reduces the difficulties much in the numerical calculations .",
    "3 ) above all , pdf was converted from ff via the dly , not a direct calculation . hence , in the present work , we would like to improve all the issues mentioned above in the same model .",
    "our strategy in the present work is as follows :    1 .",
    "pdf is directly computed by the gauge - invariant effective chiral action ( echa ) of nlchqm , satisfying the vector - current conservation .",
    "this is a similar approach as in refs .",
    "all the momentum dependences in the constituent - quark masses @xmath9 , in which the subscript @xmath10 stands for the quark flavor , are strictly taken into account : @xmath11 .",
    "one can refer for more details in refs .",
    "relevant model parameters are determined by satisfying the theoretical condition and experimental information , i.e. the pdf normalization condition , and empirical values for the pion and kaon weak - decay constants .    as already observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it turns out from the numerical results in the present work that the _ nonlocal _ contribution , which are newly considered here and necessary to preserve the gauge invariance , provides about @xmath12 of the total strength for pdf .",
    "similar tendency was also observed in refs .",
    "@xcite in the single - instanton model .",
    "moreover , those contributions play the role of broadening pdf .",
    "interestingly , careful treatment of the momentum dependences in the effective quark masses does make noticeable changes in the numerical results in comparison to those with the simplification , i.e. @xmath13 , if we compare them with the previous calculations . considering the normalization condition for pdf and @xmath14 mev as an input , we determine one of the model parameters , the constituent - quark mass at zero virtuality , to be @xmath15 mev , once we choose the model renormalization scale as @xmath16 gev phenomenologically as in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this parameter set , the kaon weak decay constant",
    "is obtained as @xmath17 mev , which is only about @xmath18 larger than its empirical value , @xmath19 mev . from the computed pdf for the pion @xmath20 and kaon @xmath21 ,",
    "we parameterize them into a simple analytic form , which was suggested in various works for extracting empirical pdf from the experimental data  @xcite . employing the dglap equation for high @xmath2 evolutions for them",
    ", we compare our results with empirical data , showing considerable agreement with them .",
    "we also present the numerical results for the ratio of @xmath22 and the moments of the pion and kaon vqdfs in comparison with the data  @xcite to verify the relevance of the present theoretical work .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the present theoretical framework , defining pdf and vqdf for the ps mesons .",
    "the numerical results and related discussions will be given in section iii .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary , conclusion , and future perspectives .",

    "we choose only positively charged pion and kaon , and assign them as @xmath27 and @xmath28 hereafter for simplicity . for other isospin states , it is straightforward to compute the multiplicable factor considering the isospin symmetry . in",
    "what follows , we want to explain how to define and calculate pdf . in general , information for the parton distribution function can be extracted from the @xmath29-@xmath30 scattering using the dy process or deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) of the ps mesons .",
    "the information of the ps - meson pdf can be represented by the hadronic tensor @xmath31 as depicted in the left of figure  [ fig1 ] , which is so - called the handbag diagram in the forward compton scattering , and it is defined as a function of the bjorken @xmath7 by  @xcite @xmath32 where the four momenta @xmath24 and @xmath33 stand for those of the ps - meson and virtual photon as shown in the left of figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    "thus , by measuring @xmath41 by experiments , one can extract pdf at a certain @xmath2 value .",
    "there can be two ways to compute pdf based on nonperturbative qcd techniques . by defining the interaction vertices in the handbag diagram , i.e. the @xmath42 and @xmath43 vertices , from effective models manifesting the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) , such as the njl model  @xcite , light - front formalism  @xcite and so on",

    "it turned out that this method for computing pdf is equivalent to the operator - product - expansion ( ope ) method , which will be explained below  @xcite .",
    "the other way is to extract the _ soft _ part for pdf from the hadron tensor @xmath31 in terms of the ope technique considering the factorization theorem  @xcite . due to the ope",
    ", the handbag diagram can be separated by the convolution of the hard and soft parts , and the separated diagrams are depicted in the right of figure  [ fig1 ] . the hard one is represented by wilson coefficients , whereas the soft one by the matrix elements of local operators in a nonperturbative manner . in the present work ,",
    "we employ this method with help of the gauge - invariant nlchqm .",
    "now , we want to focus on the effective local operators for ope , categorized by its twist and denoted by the gray blob of the soft diagram in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "since higher twists are suppressed at high @xmath2 , we will take into account only the twist-@xmath45 operator for pdf .",
    "the relevant matrix element of the local operator sandwiched by the ps - meson states can be related to the @xmath46-th moments of pdf as follows  @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the covariant derivative and light - like vector , which satisfies @xmath50 , respectively .",
