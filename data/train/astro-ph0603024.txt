    "a common feature in x - ray power spectra from many x - ray binaries ( xrb ) are quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) .",
    "many `` flavours '' of qpo have been identified , with some correlations between their frequencies ( psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "for example , low frequency ( @xmath0 of a few hz ) qpo in black hole xrb seem to appear preferentially when the state of the source changes ( rutledge et al .",
    "they are mostly observed in luminous states , high or very high state , when the energy spectrum is rather complex , showing both disc thermal component and high energy comptonized component ( see qpo observations review in wijnands 2001 ) .",
    "models of qpo so far concentrated on identifying the frequencies of oscillations , with very little if any attention paid to the fact that it is the hard x  rays which are modulated ( see qpo models review in psaltis 2001 ) . the results of gilfanov , revnivtsev & molkov ( 2003 ) and revnivtsev & gilfanov ( 2005 ) are perhaps the only ones where the energy spectra of qpo are discussed and interpreted .",
    "these authors applied fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy ( revnivtsev , gilfanov & churazov 1999 , 2001 ) to show in particular that the kilo - hz qpo spectra in neutron star xrb are the same as spectra at other fourier frequencies .",
    "this can be interpreted as common spatial origin of the x - rays showing the usual broad band noise variability and the more coherent quasi - periodic variability .",
    "the spectral shape of these components is consistent with comptonized emission from a boundary layer .",
    "fourier spectroscopy techniques are particularly suitable for analysis of qpo . however , the approach of revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 1999 ) requires integrating the power density spectra over a narrow frequency interval around a chosen frequency resulting in contamination of the fourier frequency resolved spectrum of the qpo by a contribution from the broad band variability component .",
    "thus , in this paper we construct a root - mean - square spectrum , where each point is the r.m.s .",
    "variability integrated over the component ( e.g.  a lorentzian ) describing the qpo in the broad band power spectrum .",
    "such energy dependences of qpo amplitude in xrb has been investigated before ( e.g.  belloni et al .",
    "1997 ; cui et al .",
    "1999 ; rao et al .",
    "2000 ; tomsick & kaaret 2001 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2004 ; casella et al .",
    "2004 ; see review in van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "the main conclusion from these studies is that the qpo amplitude increases with energy up to at least @xmath1 kev .",
    "this suggests immediately that the oscillations are connected with the high energy spectral component , rather than with the disk component .",

    "qualitatively , we find an interesting anti - correlation : in soft spectral states the qpo spectra are harder than the mean spectra , while they are softer than the mean spectra in hard spectral states .",
    "together with two intermediate cases this forms a continuous sequence .",
    "quantitatively , the differences between the spectra can be described by a difference in spectral indices or seed photons temperatures , or both , with the statistical quality of the various descriptions being approximately the same .",
    "the qpo spectra do contain the reprocessed component . in most datasets",
    "their presence is highly statistically significant ( 99 per cent or better ) , although the reflection amplitude is rather poorly constrained .",
    "because of that , it is not possible to determine if the amplitude is different than that in the time averaged spectrum .    in paper",
    "i we introduced a phenomenological model of qpo , where the background radial propagation model of broad band variability ( kotov et al .",
    "2001 , ycki 2003 ) is supplemented with quasi - periodic modulation of one or more of the parameters of a comptonization spectrum .",
    "the main parameters include the plasma heating rate , @xmath18 , the cooling rate by soft disc photons , @xmath19 ( here @xmath20 is the compactness parameters ) , and the amplitude of the reflected component ( describing the coupling between the heating and cooling ) .",
    "our motivation for such a model is that irrespectively of the physical mechanism behind the qpo , the modulation of the emitted x - rays can only be produced by a modulation of one or more of the parameters actually determining the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "we can now discuss our observational results in the light of that model .",
    "qpo spectra harder than the mean spectra can be obtained if the qpo are produced by modulation of the heating rate while the cooling rate does not respond fully to @xmath18 modulation .",
    "this produces spectral pivoting around the low energy end of the spectrum , and , in consequence , r.m.s .",
    "variability increasing with energy .",
    "such a model might then be applicable to the soft spectral states discussed in this paper .",
    "the model predicts a local maximum of the ew of the fe line at the qpo frequency ( see fig .  3 in paper i ) ,",
    "but the quality of our data is not sufficient to test this prediction .",
    "qpo spectra softer than the mean spectra can be produced by modulations driven by the cold disc .",
    "one possibility here is a modulation of the cooling rate .",
    "this results in the spectra pivoting around an energy point intermediate between the low and high energy ends of the spectrum ( see also zdziarski et al .  2002 ) . in the limited energy band ,",
    "e.g.  that of _",
    "rxte_/pca , it may correspond to the r.m.s .",
    "spectra decreasing with energy .",
    "the cooling rate may be modulated with or without modulation of the seed photons temperature .",
    "the difference between the two is that the qpo spectrum is monotonic in energy in the former case but it has a very deep minimum ( at the pivot energy ) in the latter case ( see figs .",
    "4 and 5 in paper i ) .",
    "additionally , qpo harmonics appear when @xmath21 is modulated , since the modulation of @xmath19 is then not sinusoidal ( even if modulation of @xmath21 is ) .",
    "however , the harmonics are limited to the soft disc component only , unlike in some of our data , for example , xte  j1550 - 564  ( i ) .",
    "the other possibility of producing a soft qpo spectrum is to modulate the amplitude of the reflected component , @xmath5 , assuming that it also describes the feedback between illuminating hard x - rays and the re - emitted soft disc photons cooling the hot plasma . because of the coupling , this again generates modulations of @xmath19 and the characteristic spectral pivoting .",
    "the most characteristic feature of this model is the strong fe line ( and the entire reprocessed component ) at @xmath22 , directly resulting from modulations of @xmath5 .",
    "contrary to that , the model with @xmath19 modulation gives either generally weak fe line , or at least a minimum at @xmath22 .",
    "the presence of the reprocessed component ( including the fe line ) in our qpo spectra makes modulation of @xmath5 an interesting possibility ( see also miller & homan 2005 ) .",
    "we note that models from paper i involving modulation of @xmath19 predict very strong soft component in the qpo spectra , which is not observed .",
    "it is rather hard to envision a geometry where the modulated soft flux would enter the hot plasma , but would not be directed towards an observer .",
    "modulation of @xmath5 also produces some soft component in the qpo spectra , but it appears less prominent than the one from @xmath19 modulation models . clearly , further development of the models is necessary to fully describe the data .",
    "another potentially useful diagnostics is the coherence function . while variations in different energy bands are perfectly coherent when @xmath5 is modulated , the coherence function shows a complex behaviour , with a number of minima , when @xmath19 and/or @xmath21 are modulated .",
    "however , distinguishing between the models based on such predicted observables as the ew of the fe line , the coherence function or the hard x - ray time lags would require better data than currently available .",
    "it needs to be emphasized that majority of physical models of qpo envision the qpo as driven by some kind of disc oscillations .",
    "however , our interpretation of the energy dependencies of low-@xmath0 qpo , at least in soft spectral states , would rather point out to modulations of the heating rate in the hot plasma .",
    "if so , then those models must find a way of transferring the disc oscillations to the hot plasma with 100 per cent efficiency , i.e.  without affecting the disc emission . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the models were formulated in the context of the high frequency qpo , where the energy dependencies might be different than those for the low-@xmath0 qpo .",
    "the only work where a physical model of the low-@xmath0 qpo was constructed is that by giannios & spruit ( 2004 ) .",
    "they consider oscillations of a hot ion - supported accretion flow coupled to a outer cold disc .",
    "the coupling is realized by a number of channels : hard x - rays illuminating the cold disc , hot protons heating the cold disc , the soft disc photons cooling the hot flow .",
    "spectral variability predicted by that model corresponds to our case of modulating the cooling rate , that is , the qpo spectra are softer than the time averaged spectra .",
    "this would then be consistent with observed qpo behaviour in the hard state .",
    "the overall geometry of a hot inner flow and an outer cold disc fits that state too .",
    "considering that the usual broad band noise x - ray variability is driven by instabilities and flares in the hot plasma , it is obvious that an important piece of physical understanding is still missing .",
    "* the qpo energy spectra are harder than the time average spectra in soft spectral states , but they are softer than the time averaged spectra in the hard state .",
    "the qpo spectra are similar in slope to the time averaged spectra , when the latter are intermediate in slope between hard and soft ( @xmath23 ) . *",
    "the disc component is absent in the qpo spectra .",
    "* comparison of the observational data with simple models of spectral variability suggests that instabilities in the hot plasma drive the low-@xmath0 qpo in the soft state , while cold disc oscillations drive the qpo in the hard state .",
