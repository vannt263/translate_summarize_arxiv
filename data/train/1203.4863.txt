    "random graphs constitute an important and active research area with numerous applications to geometry , percolation theory , information theory , queuing systems and communication networks , to mention a few .",
    "they also provide analytical means to settle prototypical questions and conjectures that may be harder to resolve in specific circumstances . in this work",
    "we analyze the traffic congestion on random delaunay triangulations with non - uniform density , erds ",
    "renyi random graphs , random @xmath0regular graphs and random geometric graphs .",
    "given a set of points in euclidean space , the delaunay triangulation gives a canonical triangulation whose vertices are these points .",
    "these triangulations have many nice combinatorial and geometric properties that make them extremely useful .",
    "moreover , they can also be constructed in riemannian manifolds .",
    "however , they do not exist for arbitrary sets of points : certain density requirements are needed to ensure that the triangulation can accurately represent both the topology and geometry of the manifold .",
    "these triangulations are canonically determined by the set of points and have many of the properties that delaunay triangulations have in the euclidean space .",
    "the definition of delaunay tessellations is the same in riemannian geometry as it is in @xmath1 .",
    "they are defined as having the empty circumscribing sphere property : the minimal radius circumscribing sphere for any simplex contains no vertices of the tessellation in its interior .",
    "however , there are several possible problems with this definition .",
    "how do we know the circumscribing sphere is unique ?",
    "for instance , a necessary requirement is that all simplices of our delaunay tessellation and their neighbors are contained inside strongly convex balls .",
    "otherwise , we would run into problems with the tessellation being well defined .",
    "since in this work we are not is interested in studying delaunay triangulations per se but in understanding their traffic congestion and graph properties , we focus on the following construction",
    ". let @xmath2 be a either the open unit disk or the whole euclidean plane with density @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 be a poisson point process of density @xmath5 on @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution and density of these points are determined by the function @xmath5 .",
    "now let @xmath7 be the delaunay triangulation of @xmath4 with respect to the euclidean metric in @xmath8 .",
    "in this work we are mostly interested in the case where the density is rotationally symmetric ( i.e. @xmath9 ) and where @xmath10 the last condition guarantees that the points in the set @xmath4 are infinite with probability one .",
    "our interest is in understanding how the graph s characteristics change as we change the density .",
    "for instance , let @xmath7 be as before and choose @xmath11 an arbitrary vertex . consider the sets @xmath12 with the graph metric ( hop metric ) .",
    "for each pair of nodes , consider a unit flow that travels through the minimum path between nodes so that the total flow in @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 .",
    "if there is more than one minimum path for some pair of nodes @xmath15 , the flow splits among them in a locally equal manner : if @xmath16 is a vertex on a such a path , the flow out of @xmath16 is split equally among neighbors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the hop metric .    given a node @xmath20",
    "we define @xmath21 as the total flow generated in @xmath13 passing through @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , @xmath21 is the sum off all the geodesic paths in @xmath13 which are carrying flow and contain the node @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the maximum vertex flow @xmath23 it is easy to see that for any graph @xmath24 .",
    "analogously , we can define @xmath25 as the maximum edge congestion .",
    "note that the same question can be formulated by replacing the infinite graph @xmath7 with a sequence of graphs @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "one of our main motivations is to understand how @xmath22 is affected by changes in the function @xmath5 .",
    "we also study how the density affects the degree distribution of the corresponding triangulation .",
    "another topic is the maximum vertex flow in erds - renyi random graphs , random geometric graphs and random @xmath0regular graphs .",
    "it was observed in many complex networks , man - made or natural , that the typical distance between the nodes is surprisingly small .",
    "more formally , as a function of the number of nodes @xmath28 , the average distance between a node pair typically scales at or below @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , many of these complex networks , specially communication networks , have high congestion .",
    "more precisely , there exists a small number of nodes called the _ core _ where most of the traffic pass through . in this work , we present a possible solution to this problem .",
    "given a graph @xmath30 , consider the graph @xmath31 constructed by adding a random maximal matching to @xmath32 .",
    "more precisely , we choose a pair of nodes at random from @xmath32 and add an edge between these two nodes if they are not already connected .",
    "now , we remove these two nodes from the possible candidates and repeat this process until there is only one or no nodes remaining ( depending on the parity of @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is clear that the new graph @xmath31 has the same nodes as before , and it has at most @xmath34 extra edges .",
    "moreover , we added at most an extra edge at every node .",
    "we show that if the original graph satisfies certain hypotheses ( exponential growth ) then we can reduce the maximum vertex flow to @xmath35 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sconstruc ] , we present the construction of the random delaunay triangulations and we show a necessary condition to guarantee maximum vertex flow of the order @xmath36 . we also show that for any planar graph , congestion can not be smaller that @xmath37 regardless of how the flow is routed . in section [ analysis ] , we analyze the maximum flow and degree distribution for several examples . in section [ rg ] , we analyze maximum vertex and edge flow in random erds - renyi random graphs , random geometric graphs and random @xmath0regular graphs .",
    "we further present the main result on the congestion after a random matching .",
    "finally , section [ imp_alg ] discusses some of the algorithms used , their complexity and how they were implemented .",
    "consider @xmath38 the open ball of radius @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a rotationally symmetric density on @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a poisson process with intensity @xmath5 on @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the delaunay triangulation of the set of points in @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , introducing geodesic polar coordinates @xmath41 makes it apparent that for any borel set @xmath42 the expected number of points in @xmath43 is @xmath44 therefore , if @xmath45 then almost surely @xmath7 induces and infinite graph ( triangulation ) on @xmath6 .",
    "[ examp1 ] if @xmath39 and @xmath46 then @xmath5 corresponds to the constant density on the unit ball with the metric of the hyperbolic space under the poincar disk representation with curvature @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath40 and @xmath48 then @xmath5 corresponds to the constant density on the euclidean space .    for notational simplicity , we assume that @xmath49 ; otherwise we choose the closest point to the origin .",

    "consider @xmath13 the graph induced by the finite set @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 is the hop metric in the triangulation . in this section ,",
    "we are interested in analyzing the traffic behavior on the graph @xmath13 as @xmath56 increases as we discussed in the introduction .",
    "for instance , if @xmath57 is @xmath58 , the complete graph with @xmath28 vertices , then @xmath59 .",
    "it was proved , in @xcite that if @xmath32 is an infinite gromov hyperbolic graph then @xmath60 .",
    "( for more details in gromov hyperbolic graphs , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , trees have congestion of the order @xmath61 .",
    "one of our main questions is , what is the rate of growth of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , under what conditions is @xmath65    the next theorem gives a sufficient condition , but first let us recall a result from riemannian geometry . given a rotationally symmetric riemannian surface with metric @xmath66 , its curvature @xmath67 is equal to @xmath68    assume @xmath69 is equal to @xmath70 , and let @xmath5 be a differentiable , strictly increasing function that is strongly convex ( i.e. , @xmath71 is convex ) and satisfies condition ( [ rho ] )",
    ". then there exists @xmath72 such that @xmath73    let @xmath74 be the riemannian surface with metric @xmath75 .",
    "then its area form @xmath76 is equal to @xmath77 .",
    "hence , the euclidean unit ball @xmath78 with volume density @xmath79 corresponds to this metric . by applying equation ( [ curvature ] ) to @xmath6",
    "we see that @xmath80 since @xmath81 is increasing and strongly convex , we observe that @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a poisson process in @xmath78 with intensity @xmath5 .",
    "this is equivalent to a poisson process in @xmath6 of constant unit intensity .",
    "let @xmath7 be its delaunay triangulation , and let @xmath50 be an increasing sequence converging to 1 .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the restriction of @xmath7 to @xmath84 , and let @xmath85 .",
    "as before , we assume that @xmath49 ( otherwise we choose the closest point to the origin ) . for each @xmath86 , the volume @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , we have only a finite number of nodes in @xmath89 and an infinite number outside this ball",
    ". since we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath90 , we can ignore all the traffic flow generated inside @xmath89 for @xmath56 sufficiently large .",
    "given @xmath91 and @xmath92 in @xmath93 , let @xmath94 be the geodesic in @xmath6 connecting these two points . since @xmath6 has negative curvature , the geodesics bend over to the origin . in particular",
    ", let @xmath95 be the number such that @xmath96 and let @xmath97 be the shadow of this ball seen through the point @xmath98 to the unit circle according to the euclidean metric and let @xmath99 be the shadow of this point according to the metric on @xmath6 as shown in figure [ shadow ] . since @xmath6 has negative curvature , it is clear that @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath99 depends only on the distance from @xmath98 to the origin .",
    "let @xmath101 in the unit circle @xmath102 .    .",
    "the shadow @xmath97 is in magenta and the shadow @xmath99 is in red . ]    by construction , the points in @xmath4 are distributed in such a way that there is one point per unit area in @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the geodesics in @xmath7 are quasi ",
    "geodesics in @xmath6 .",
    "then the traffic flow in @xmath13 is equal to the traffic in @xmath103 up to a constant .",
    "hence , up to a fixed constant , @xmath104 proving our claim .    as mentioned above , the rate of growth of @xmath90 is between @xmath105 and @xmath36 for any graph with @xmath28 nodes .",
    "the next theorem shows that this function can be narrowed down if the graph is planar .",
    "[ n3/2 ] if @xmath32 is a planar graph , then @xmath106 where @xmath28 is the number of nodes in @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the same result holds for any traffic routing ( not necessarily geodesic routing ) .    by the planar separator theorem ( @xcite ) in any @xmath28-vertex planar graph @xmath107",
    ", there exists a partition of the vertices of @xmath32 into three sets @xmath43 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 such that each of @xmath43 and @xmath109 has at most @xmath110 vertices , @xmath108 has @xmath111 vertices , and there are no edges with one endpoint in @xmath43 and one endpoint in @xmath109 .",
    "it is not required that @xmath43 or @xmath109 form connected subgraphs of @xmath32 .",
    "the set @xmath108 is called the separator for this partition .",
    "therefore , all the traffic between nodes in @xmath43 and @xmath109 has to pass through a node in @xmath108 .",
    "hence , by the pigeonhole principle there exists a node in @xmath108 with traffic at least @xmath37 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that if the graph @xmath32 has exponential growth then @xmath112 independently of how the traffic is routed .      in this subsection , we describe a way to construct a realization of the poisson @xmath4 in practice .",
    "let @xmath113 be the measure preserving map given in polar coordinates by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is an increasing function that depends on the function @xmath5 .",
    "this map is measure preserving if and only if for every @xmath116 , @xmath117 therefore , @xmath118 has to be equal to @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the inverse with respect to composition of the function @xmath121 .",
    "let @xmath122 be a poisson point process on the euclidean plane of constant intensity @xmath70 .",
    "we can construct @xmath4 as the set of points @xmath123 .",
    "hence , everything boils down to constructing a poisson process on the euclidean space which can be done by partitioning the space into a set of disjoint annuli and uniformly distributing points in these annuli .",
    "in this section , we show some simulation results obtained for the maximum edge and vertex flow as well as the degree distribution for different densities @xmath5 .",
    "assume that @xmath5 is as in example  [ examp1 ] .",
    "then it is an easy calculation to show that @xmath124 and @xmath125 , hence @xmath126 in figure [ ff1 ] , we show the delaunay triangulation with 10,000 nodes of the previous surface for different values of the intensity @xmath127 . in table",
