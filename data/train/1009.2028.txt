    "this paper deals with the problem of recovering missing samples of band - limited functions and of its derivative via frame reconstruction sampling formulas .",
    "a band - limited signal is a function which belongs to the space @xmath0 of functions in @xmath1 whose fourier transforms have support in @xmath2 $ ] . functions in this space can be expanded in terms of the orthonormal basis of translates of the _ sinc _ function .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are the samples of the function at a uniform grid on @xmath3 , with  density \" @xmath4 ( _ nyquist _ density ) .",
    "such expansions , called sampling formulas , have been generalized by replacing the orthonormal basis with more general families , like riesz bases and frames , formed by the translates of one or more functions ( _ generators _ ) .",
    "frames , unlike riesz basis , are overcomplete and their redundancy provides a perfect tool for the recovery of missing data .    the problem of recovering missing samples has been investigated first by p.j.s.g .",
    "ferreira in @xcite , where it is shown that , in the case of a generalized kramer sampling , under suitable oversampling assumptions , any finite set of missing samples can be recovered from the others by solving a linear system @xmath5 , where the matrix @xmath6 is positive definite .",
    "moreover the author studies the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath6 in dependence of the oversampling parameter and the number of missing samples . successively",
    "santos and ferreira considered the case of a two - channel derivative oversampling formula obtained by projecting the generators of a riesz basis of the space @xmath0 and their duals into the space @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xcite . with this technique",
    "they obtain a pair of dual frames , although the dual frame is not the canonical one . in their paper",
    "the authors show that a finite number of missing samples either of the function or of its derivative can be recovered , solving in each case a non singular linear system similar to the one - channel case .",
    "however the authors do not consider the case when samples both of the function and the derivative are simultaneously missing .",
    "+ the technique of santos and ferreira has been applied to more general two - channels by j. m. kim and k. h. kwon @xcite , who gave sufficient conditions for the recovery of missing samples , from a single channel and from both channels . however , as the authors observe , these conditions do not apply to the derivative sampling formulas studied in @xcite .",
    "successively , in @xcite , the author gave new derivative oversampling formulas of any order , where the dual generator is the canonical dual and in @xcite found an expression of the dual in the two - channel case .",
    "the use of the canonical dual allowed the author to prove in @xcite that simultaneously missing samples of the function and of the derivative can be recovered .",
    "however the generators of the canonical duals are much less explicit than the non - canonical dual used by santos and ferreira see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 5.2 ) p. 178 ) and ( [ antif ] ) .",
    "+ in this paper we study the problem of the recovery of missing samples of the function and of its derivative in ferreira s two - channel derivative formula . the technique we use , first proposed in @xcite , extends in a natural way that for one channel in @xcite and consists in solving a system @xmath9 , where the matrix @xmath10 ( see ( [ sfi ] ) ) is a block matrix depending on the dual generators and on the position of the missing samples , and the unknowns @xmath11 are the missing samples of the function and its derivative . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no results are known about the possibility of solving this system , i.e. of recovering simultaneous missing samples of the function and of its derivative .",
    "+ we obtain estimates of the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the block submatrices of the matrix @xmath10 , show that in some cases the matrix reduces to a lower triangular matrix and provide several numerical experiments on the dependence of the eigenvalues on the parameters of the problem , like the oversampling parameter @xmath12 and the number of missing samples .",
    "moreover , we experiment the recovery of missing samples and the reconstruction of a signal , paying particular attention to the computational aspects , analyzing the ill - conditioned problem of contiguous samples , also with noisy data .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we establish notation and collect some results to be used later . in section 3",
    "we describe the technique for the recovery of the missing samples .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to the study of the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrices in the system , mostly when the missing samples are equidistant . in this case , we find estimates of the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the diagonal submatrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath10 ( see ( [ sfi ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , we find that in some cases the matrix @xmath6 is lower triangular and that half of its eigenvalues are equal to @xmath15 , half to @xmath16 , where @xmath12 is the oversampling parameter .",
    "this extends to two channels a result in @xcite .",
    "we also present some numerical experiments supporting the theory .",
    "finally , in section 5 , we analyze the case of contiguous missing samples both for one and two channels , when the problem may become very ill - conditioned .",
    "we present a numerical procedure to solve it , also in presence of noisy data , via regularization techniques .",
    "in this section we collect some results on frames to be used later .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation .",
    "the fourier transform of a function @xmath17 in @xmath18 is @xmath19 in this paper vectors in @xmath20 are to be considered as column - vectors , however , to save space , we shall write @xmath21 to denote the column - vector whose components are @xmath22",

    "canonical dual frame _ , and @xmath46 ; explicitly @xmath47 the elements of @xmath48 are called _ generators _ of the frame and the elements of @xmath41 _ canonical dual generators_. given a frame @xmath44 of a hilbert space @xmath49 the expansion of an element in terms of the generators is not unique ; a frame @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is called _ dual frame _ for @xmath44 .",
    "we remind that the coefficients @xmath52 with respect to the _ canonical _ dual frame have the minimal @xmath53 norm among all the sequences that represent an element @xmath17 in terms of a given frame @xmath44 .",
    "if the family @xmath28 is a frame for @xmath24 and the operator @xmath54 is injective , then @xmath55 is called a _",
    "riesz basis_.    let @xmath44 be a frame of a @xmath23-shift - invariant hilbert space @xmath24 with canonical dual generators @xmath41 .",
    "denote by @xmath56 the orthogonal projection on a @xmath23-shift - invariant subspace @xmath57 of @xmath24 , then @xmath58 and @xmath59 are families of dual frames for @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath60 note that @xmath59 is not necessarily the canonical dual .",
    "+ in this paper we study families @xmath44 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 have fourier transform @xmath64}(x ) $ ] and @xmath65}(x ) $ ] and @xmath23 and @xmath66 are such that @xmath67 .",
    "the interest of these families in applications resides in their connection with derivative sampling formulas for the space @xmath0 . to simplify notation , throughout the paper we shall set @xmath68",
    "the family @xmath69 , @xmath70 defined by @xmath71}(x)\\hskip 2truecm   \\widehat{\\psi_2}(x)=ix\\chi_{[-h , h]}(x)\\ ] ] is a riesz basis for the space @xmath72 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "for any @xmath76 the coefficients of the expansion in ( [ expansionzero ] ) are @xmath77 thus the expansion formula ( [ expansionzero ] ) becomes @xmath78 for any @xmath79 note that the convergence is uniform .",
    "this formula is called a _",
    "first order derivative sampling formula_. the sampling frequency for an @xmath80-channel formula is @xmath81 and is called _ nyquist frequency_. by using a frame instead of a riesz basis , in @xcite the authors obtained a two - channel derivative formula where the sampling frequency in each channel is greater than the nyquist frequency @xmath82 ( _ first order derivative oversampling formula _ ) .",
    "the frame is obtained by projecting on @xmath0 the riesz basis @xmath69 for @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 we denote by @xmath12 the ratio @xmath86 since the projection commutes with the translations , to project the family @xmath87 and the dual family , it is sufficient to project on @xmath0 the generators and the dual generators .",

    "we observe that @xmath92 is the ratio between the sampling frequency and the nyquist frequency and that @xmath93 we shall be mainly interested to the case @xmath94 , since for @xmath95 it is possible to use one channel separately for the function and for its derivative @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath12 is close to 1 , the frame is close to a riesz basis , while if @xmath12 is small the frame is very redundant .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the method for the recovery of a finite number of missing samples via two - channel derivative oversampling .",

    "+ suppose that in ( [ xf ] ) only the values @xmath124 are missing , while all the values of @xmath125 are known . by considering only the first @xmath80 equations of the system ( [ sistema ] ) and by separating the known from the unknown samples ,",

    "we conjecture that all its eigenvalues are real and that they lie in the interval @xmath140 for all @xmath139 . in section 4",
    "we present several numerical experiments supporting our conjecture .",
    "this section is dedicated to the study of the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath142 in the two - channel system ( [ sistema ] ) .",
    "first , we briefly summarize the one - channel case and recall some stability results matrix obtained in @xcite .",
    "the one - channel formula is @xmath143 where @xmath144 . in this case",
    "the oversampling parameter is @xmath145 .",
    "let @xmath146 be a set of integer numbers and @xmath147 the set of missing samples ; then the system to be solved is @xmath148 where @xmath114 is the identity @xmath149 matrix @xmath150 @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 the matrix @xmath154 is symmetric and positive definite . in @xcite",
    "the author shows that all its eigenvalues are in @xmath155 and observes that there are two situations that lead to a ill - conditioned problem : when @xmath12 is close to 1 and when the integers @xmath123 are contiguous . in the first case ,",
    "the frame is close to a riesz basis , when the recovery is impossible and @xmath154 becomes the identity matrix . in the second case the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath156 grows rapidly with @xmath80 ; moreover it can be close to 1 also for small values of @xmath80 ( see figure  5 in @xcite ) . in both cases",
    "the spectral condition number of the matrix @xmath157 , which controls the propagation of errors on the data , becomes very large .",
    "next , we investigate the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath10 in the two channel case ( see ( [ sfi ] ) ) and of its submatrices @xmath158 and @xmath14 . since the latter are real symmetric matrices , their eigenvalues give their condition number .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath159 the maximum integer less than or equal to @xmath160 .",

    "the trace of @xmath13 is @xmath166 ; by ( [ matrice ] ) and ( [ derfi12 ] ) the trace of @xmath14 is @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , since the entries of the matrix @xmath10 are real , its eigenvalues are complex conjugates , thus its trace is @xmath168 ; hence @xmath169 we observe that , if the oversampling parameter @xmath12 tends to 1 , i.e. the frame tends to a riesz basis , then @xmath10 tends to the identity matrix .",
    "following ferreira , we shall now consider the case in which the set that locates the positions of the missing samples is @xmath170 where @xmath171 is an integer and @xmath172 is a set of integers ; in the following we shall denote such sets by @xmath173 .",
    "the interest for studying these cases lies in the technique of interleaving the samples of a signal , prior to their transmission or archival ; the advantage of this procedure is that the transmitted ( or stored ) information becomes less sensitive to the burst errors that typically affect contiguous set of samples ( @xcite ) .",

    "first we consider the case @xmath175 integer .",
    "the following proposition , which extends to two channels a result in @xcite , shows that in this case the matrix @xmath10 is lower triangular and that @xmath80 eigenvalues are equal to @xmath15 and @xmath80 are equal to @xmath176 hence if @xmath12 is rational @xmath177 one can take @xmath171 equal to a multiple of @xmath178 and obtain a lower - triangular matrix @xmath10 .

    "this shows that @xmath192 similarly , by using ( [ matrice ] ) and ( [ derfi12 ] ) , we obtain that @xmath193 and @xmath194 . from ( [ derdualiferr ] )",
    "one finds that the off - diagonal entries of the matrix @xmath184 are @xmath195 the diagonal entries in @xmath184 are equal to zero , since @xmath196    in the following theorem we find estimates for the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath13 and @xmath197 the estimates do not depend on the number @xmath80 of missing samples and are simple to compute .      from ( [ dualgen ] ) , by fourier inversion and a change of variable , we obtain @xmath206 hence by ( [ matrice ] ) with @xmath207 ,",
    "@xmath208 let @xmath209 be a column - vector in @xmath210 and denote by @xmath211 its conjugate transpose .",
    "then @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the @xmath214-periodic function @xmath215 by splitting the integral in two parts and changing variable the left hand side of the above equation may be written @xmath216 where we have set @xmath217 next we write the integral in ( [ xsx ] ) as a sum of @xmath218 integrals @xmath219 since @xmath220 we majorize @xmath221 in each integral and obtain the estimate @xmath222 next we prove that for all @xmath223 @xmath224 indeed by ( [ m ] ) , by changing variables and using the @xmath225-periodicity of @xmath226 @xmath227 by ( [ poly ] ) and the plancherel formula , since @xmath228 has norm equal to 1 , we have @xmath229 this concludes the proof of equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "next we prove that @xmath230 indeed , from ( [ m ] ) , by changing variable in the integral and using the @xmath231-periodicity of @xmath232 , we obtain @xmath233 the length @xmath234 of the interval of integration is less than the period @xmath214 of @xmath226 thus inequality ( [ eq:2 ] ) follows from ( [ normfi ] ) . + from ( [ ineq:1 ] ) , by using ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath235= \\frac{d}{m}\\big(1   -\\frac{d}{4m}-\\frac{1}{4 m } \\big)+\\frac{1}{m}\\ ] ] thus we have proved the upper bound for the eigenvalues of @xmath236 from ( [ xsx:1 ] ) , by observing that the second integral is positive and using ( [ eq:1 ] ) we obtain @xmath237 this proves the lower bound and concludes the proof of inequality ( [ s11eig ] ) .",
    "the omit the proof of inequality ( [ s22eig ] ) which is similar .",
    "of course , by using a smaller oversampling parameter , one can reduce the condition number of the matrix @xmath241 , obtaining much better results : using @xmath242 ( hence @xmath243 ) , and the same set @xmath244 , one gets @xmath245 and maximum absolute error on the samples of the signal equal to @xmath246 . in section 2",
    "we have observed that , in the two - channel formula , the case @xmath247 implies oversampling in each channel separately , thus it can be used the one - channel formula separately for the signal and its derivative .",
    "however , the two alternative are not numerically equivalent . to recover the same missing samples via the one - channel formula ,",
    "we have taken @xmath248 and @xmath244 and we have obtained a maximum absolute error on the samples of the signal equal to @xmath249 .",
