    "to describe high - energy nuclear physics , the knowledge of the in - medium behavior of quasiparticles such as quarks , gluons , mesons and baryons including their antiparticles is crucial .",
    "the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) seems to be the best tool to proceed to this study .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known that the direct implementation of the qcd lagrangian is not feasible in this state except for some particular cases . in order to avoid the qcd difficulties ,",
    "some effective models were developed .    in this respect ,",
    "the low - energy particle sector is well described by effective chiral theories of qcd , the nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it can be studied in the entire temperature range .",
    "the njl model also offers a simple intuitive view of chiral symmetry breakdown and restoration via the realization of the quark - antiquark pairing similar to the bcs theory of superconductivity .",
    "however , a simple point - like interaction form of the model does not ensure its renomalizability , and a cutoff scale @xmath2 must be introduced in the theory .",
    "the impossibility to treat the confinement - deconfinement phase transition and the absence of gluons are other important defects of the njl model .    to eliminate partially these defects , it has recently been proposed to couple the quarks to a polyakov loop  @xcite as a mechanism that could simulate the confinement , even if the model does not consider the color degrees of freedom as done in qcd .",
    "this realized approach is called the polyakov - nambu  jona - lasinio model ( pnjl )  @xcite .",
    "some recent results show that this approach , exhibiting a smooth crossover at zero baryon density and a first - order phase transition at a large baryon chemical potential , provides some advantages  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the extended model allows one to correctly reproduce lattice data of qcd thermodynamics  @xcite as well as to improve the njl model at low temperature due to the suppression of the contribution of colored states .",
    "in addition , the pnjl model is more efficient for describing the restoration of the chiral symmetry by a rapid decrease in the effective masses of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the phase structure and its dependence on thermodynamic variables is still an open problem and raises some interesting questions including chiral symmetry restoration , color superconductivity , and charged pion condensation phenomena .",
    "in particular , it has been found that if the isospin chemical potential @xmath3 in a charge neutral quark matter is lower than the critical value required for the realization of the pion condensation , pions do not condense and , therefore , even above the critical temperature a bound state with the pion quantum numbers can be formed  @xcite .    at high temperatures ( @xmath4 300 mev )",
    "it is supposed that the pnjl description is reliable up to a temperature of approximately 2.5@xmath5 .",
    "for still higher temperatures the transverse gluons , ignored in the pnjl treatment , are expected to be non - negligible  @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction in such a nonperturbative regime of the deconfinement phase is taken into account through an effective temperature - dependent mass for the gluons with a polyakov - loop background , leaving open the possibility that lighter quasiparticles propagate in the medium  @xcite .",
    "allowability of quark - gluon degrees of freedom along with hadronic ones means that the model for heavy - ion collisions should be multiphase in nature and include possible phase transitions between different phases .",
    "generally , this complicated situation can be described in terms of hydrodynamics or kinetics which have their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the use of kinetics for the quark - gluon phase needs knowledge of in - medium cross sections for its constituents . in a multiphase transport ( ampt )",
    "model  @xcite this phase is described in terms of the parton cascade with the partonic elastic cross sections estimated within the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "the effect of the surrounding matter was roughly included by introducing the effective debye mass .    the microscopic quark dynamics is studied in a more elaborated way in the parton hadron string dynamics ( phsd ) model  @xcite where the plasma evolution is solved by a kadanoff - baym type equation . here",
    "the potentials between the plasma constituents are chosen in such a way that the model equation of state is consistent with lattice calculations .",
    "the cross sections are derived from the spacelike part of the interaction and are employed for the scattering interactions among the plasma constituents . in this model , gluons as well as quarks acquire a large mass when approaching the phase transition",
    ". therefore , the prehadrons which are created in the phase transition are rather heavy .",
    "another model which allows for these studies is a gluonic cascade realized in the boltzmann approach to multi parton scattering ( bamps )  @xcite .",
    "the gluon emission and interaction during the expansion stage of the qgp move the system towards equilibrium .",
    "a parton cascade approach with a pqcd inspired cross section was applied also at the rhic energy to study scaling properties of the elliptic flow  @xcite and chemical composition of the quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "the quantum molecular dynamics of the expanding @xmath6 plasma has been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "properties of quarks as well as elastic scattering cross sections were calculated within the three - flavor njl model .",
    "all the kinetic multiphase models mentioned above should describe a transition from one to another phase : from quarks - gluons to hadrons , in our case .",
    "this smooth transition is simulated by a possible coalescence of quark - antiquark or three quarks , being close to each other in coordinate and momentum space , to form a meson or a baryon thereby creating a mixed parton - hadron phase which is a typical feature of the crossover phase transition . as was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of a simple thermodynamically consistent statistical model , the gluon - glueball system exhibiting a crossover phase transition shows the first order phase transition if the interaction between mixed phase constituents is neglected . as to chiral njl - like models , the appearance of a first - order chiral phase transition is a characteristic feature of the simplest versions of these models .",
    "sensitivity of the phase structure to the parameters characterizing the quasiparticle interaction has noted many years ago .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the location of the qcd critical point moves in accord with the repulsive vector - channel interaction which may result in the disappearance of the critical end - point at sufficiently large values of the vector interaction coupling turning it into crossover  @xcite . a pronounced impact on the phase diagram",
    "is also given by breaking of the @xmath7 symmetry due to the axial anomaly in qcd which is introduced into models by adding the kobayashi - maskava-t hooft interaction to be responsible for the large mass of the @xmath8 meson .",
    "the decrease of this interaction strength may dismiss the associated existence of a critical point in the phase diagram  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we want to make a step towards account for the interaction between constituents of quark - gluon and hadronic phases . basing on the pnjl model",
    "we give here the first estimate for interaction of quarks / antiquarks with pions which is expected to be a dominant component of this type of interactions .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to calculate quark - quark , quark - antiquark and antiquark - antiquark cross sections and generalize this approach to the case of quark - pion scattering .",
    "the consideration is based on the chiral two - flavor pnjl model the key points of which are remind in the next section ii . in sections",
    "iii and iv , the main equations are given for different channels of quark-(anti)quark elastic scattering and are generalized to the quark - hadron case in section iv .",
    "their numerical results for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 processes are presented and discussed in section v. we conclude the obtained results in section vi .",

    "[ h ]    such behavior is more transparent from simplified two - body pqcd calculations with @xmath196 used in the ampt model  @xcite . in particular , for the gluon elastic scattering ( which differs by the casimir factor from the @xmath9 scattering ) one has @xmath197 with the strong coupling constant @xmath198 .",
    "equation  ( [ el_qcd ] ) is obtained in the leading - order qcd by keeping only the leading divergent terms for identical particles , which allows one to limit oneself to the angle range @xmath199 ( the last equality in ( [ el_qcd ] ) ) .",
    "the cross section really diverges at the scattering angle @xmath2000 .",
    "the singularity in this cross section can be regularized by introducing the debye screening mass @xmath201 leading to @xmath202 and , respectively , for the total cross section at relativistic energies @xmath203 if @xmath204  @xcite .",
    "note that in this approximation the pqcd gives an energy - independent cross section ( [ s - pqcd ] ) in disagreement with the njl - like chiral model discussed .",
    "taking @xmath2053 @xmath206 we get @xmath2073 mb . in the real ampt calculations",
    "@xmath201 is a parameter and this cross section changes from 3 to 10 mb in different model versions  @xcite .",

    "[ crosqh ] .",
    "for the    [ thb ]    considered reactions @xmath208 and their charge conjugated ones the cross sections behave very similarly : @xmath163 is maximal just at the threshold @xmath209 reaching here values of 60 - 80 mb and then monotonically falls down rather quickly with the slightly different slopes for different reactions . at the mott temperature and for all energies",
    "the @xmath10 elastic cross section exhibits a huge maximum as large as several hundred of mb ( to be cut in fig .",
    "[ crosqh ] ) . generally , the magnitude of the quark - pion cross sections is higher than the quark - quark one and comparable with free hadron - hadron cross sections . in the case of the @xmath210 reaction ,",
    "the cross section fall - off is the slowest , and the quark - pion scattering turns out to be several times higher than that for quark - quark in the energy range @xmath211(0.7 - 1.5 ) gev .    as is seen from fig .",
    "[ crosqh ] ( right - bottom panel ) , @xmath212 is a weakly changing function up to @xmath169 0.18 gev and then has a kick at the mott temperature .",
    "this cross section is the sum of different terms corresponding to the squared amplitudes : @xmath213 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 11a ] ) ) , @xmath214 ( eq .  ( [ 22a ] ) ) , @xmath215 ( eq .  ( [ 33a ] ) ) and summary interference term @xmath216 ( eqs .",

    "the dominant @xmath82-channel gives @xmath217 .",
    "in contrast , the cross section of the @xmath79-channel is very small , @xmath2180.5 mb .",
    "the rest of @xmath163 is shared almost equally between the sum of all interference terms @xmath216 ( note the scale in figure ) and the @xmath219channel @xmath213 elastic cross section .",
    "[ thb ]    in fig .",
    "[ adqh ] , some examples of the angular distribution are given for the quark - pion scattering . at the energy @xmath220 0.5 gev , independently of t , the angular distributions are isotropic with high accuracy , besides in the vicinity of @xmath177 .",
    "at higher energy and moderate temperatures @xmath188 the differential distributions are almost isotropic with small anisotropy growing at the backward scattering angles .",
    "this backward bounce is more prominent for lower energies .",
    "the presented angular distributions are really the contributions of diagrams of three types ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_dir ] ) . as is shown in the right - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ adqh ] and in accordance with the above discussion , @xmath214 is dominant and completely defines the backward scattering ( note the scale factor 0.2 in the figure ) .",
    "the @xmath221 and @xmath222 angular distributions are forward peaked but the asymmetry is much more pronounced in the @xmath78-channel .",
    "the sum of interference terms results in the distribution with a broad maximum at @xmath2230 .",
    "the presented results are the same for the @xmath224 and @xmath225 reactions because their flavor factors are the same ( see table ii ) . for other channels of the quark - pion scattering ,",
    "the shape of angular distributions is similar to that for @xmath224 but the magnitude is lower in accordance with the flavor factors in table ii .",
    "since a pion consists of a quark - antiquark pair , the substitution @xmath226 for quarks does not change the calculated scattering cross sections results in fig .",
    "[ crosqh ] and angular distributions in the @xmath78- and @xmath82-channels shown in fig .",
    "[ adqh ] are exchanged .",
    "in - medium elastic scattering of quarks is evaluated by treating quarks in terms of the two - flavor pnjl model accounting for their scalar and pseudoscalar interactions and using the large @xmath227 approximation .",
    "the model parameters are in agreement with low - energy static mesonic properties and lattice qcd results for gluons .",
    "general trends of the energy and temperature dependence of @xmath163 and @xmath228 are investigated in a large range of @xmath164 and @xmath29 at both below and above the mott temperature .",
    "essential influence of the flavor of interacting quarks on the scattering results is noted .",
    "the comparison with the earlier works shows that the @xmath11 pnjl results agree with those of the njl model for the same @xmath11 symmetry ( at @xmath229 ) but noticeably below in the case of three flavors .",
    "this difference is due to a larger number of contributing intermediate states for the quark scattering in the case of @xmath182 symmetry .",
    "the above pnjl results are presented for the vanishing chemical potential .",
    "however , @xmath37 enters not only into the pauli exclusion factor but also into the polarization function @xmath230 which makes masses and coupling constants to be @xmath37-dependent . to consider the quark - baryon case ,",
    "an additional issue arises : one should treat properly the loop formed by the quark and the diquark that form the baryon . as demonstrated in  @xcite , taking into account the finite chemical potential results in some suppression of the scattering cross sections at large @xmath37 .",
    "the pnjl approach should also be generalized to the @xmath182 symmetry .",
    "this allows one to extend the set of reactions including strange quark and strange hadrons and to effect non - strange reactions due to increasing a number of possible intermediate states , as noted above .",
    "this work is in progress now .    the first predictions for the quark - pion scattering are given .",
    "the integral cross sections for this reaction are higher than those in the quark - quark case .",
    "the quark differential @xmath231-distribution is practically constant with some enhancement in the backward direction at @xmath2321 gev .",
    "the developed technique and obtained results can be applied in the kinetic approach  @xcite to take into account the interaction between constituents of quark - gluon and hadronic phases .",
    "the derived formulae for the elastic quark - hadron scattering can be easily generalized to the expression for gamma and dielectron emission  @xcite .",
    "this new channel can definitely give rise to an observable effect and would confirm the existence of the quark - hadron interaction .",
    "another possible implementation of these results is a study of transport properties of the system .",
    "for example , the shear viscosity @xmath233 can be estimated in the so - called relaxation time approximation by using the average momentum loss @xmath234 , the quark densities @xmath235 and the mean life time as @xmath236 , the mean life time being inversely proportional to the quark cross sections @xmath237 ref .",
    "@xcite . in the two - flavor njl model ,",
    "this shear viscosity was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the chiral limit @xmath196 .",
    "one should not expect a noticeable difference with our model treating a quark system with the finite quark masses in the @xmath11 pnjl model , especially at high temperature where the njl model is more justified .",
    "however , for the mixed quark - hadron system considered in  @xcite the shear viscosity should be smaller , because the @xmath10 elastic cross section is noticeably larger than the quark - quark one and particle density of quarks and pions is rather abounded in the mixed phase .",
    "certainly , this problem deserves a more elaborated study , for example , by the method developed in ref .",
