    "it has been firmly established that a significant fraction of the energy density of the universe resides in the form of dark matter ( dm ) , whose total abundance and approximate distribution has been inferred via its gravitational influence  @xcite .",
    "however , we have as yet no direct detection , and the fundamental particle properties of dm remain unknown .",
    "a promising technique to explore the particle nature of dm is to search for signatures of dm annihilation or decay .",
    "this is achieved by examining fluxes of particles emanating from regions of dm concentration either in our own galaxy or throughout the cosmos .",
    "indirect dm detection has been the subject of much recent attention , due to measured cosmic ray excesses of positrons and electrons above those expected from conventional astrophysical processes .",
    "pamela has observed a sharp excess in the @xmath4 fraction at energies beyond approximately 10 gev  @xcite , without a corresponding excess in the antiproton / proton data  @xcite , while fermi and hess have reported more modest excesses in the @xmath5 flux at energies of order 1 tev  @xcite .",
    "these signals have led to a reexamination of positron production in nearby pulsars  @xcite , emission from supernova remnants  @xcite , acceleration of @xmath6 in cosmic ray sources  @xcite , and propagation in conventional cosmic ray models  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed the excess electrons and positrons are not due to conventional astrophysics process , but arise instead from dm annihilation or decay in the galactic halo .",
    "a plethora of dm models have been designed with this goal in mind ( for a review see for example  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a viable resolution of the cosmic ray @xmath7 data by means of dm annihilation requires a large branching ratio to leptons",
    ". a large branching ratio to hadrons would make a contribution to cosmic ray antiproton fluxes , for which stringent observational bounds exist .",
    "therefore , so called leptophilic models are preferred , in which dm couples ( at tree level ) only to leptons . however , for many scenarios in which the dm particle is a majorana fermion , annihilation to light fermions is helicity suppressed ( @xmath8 in the @xmath9-wave contribution , and of course velocity suppressed ( @xmath10 ) in the @xmath11-wave contribution .",
    "this is the case for popular dm candidates such as the neutralino of supersymmetric models , if @xmath12 is below the @xmath13 threshold ; or bino models with highly suppressed annihilation to @xmath14 and @xmath15 final states .",
    "large boost factors would be required for such a scenario to explain any observed positron excess .",
    "it has long been known that photon bremsstrahlung can lift helicity suppressions  @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that helicity suppressions are also lifted by the bremsstrahlung of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 gauge boson  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "( electroweak radiative corrections to dm annihilation , but without the observation of helicity unsuppression , have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) where a helicity suppression is lifted , the cross sections for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 can all greatly exceed that for the lowest order process @xmath19 .",
    "the bremsstrahlung processes thus may allow for the indirect detection of many dm models which would otherwise be helicity suppressed .",
    "importantly , the decay of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge bosons inevitably leads to the production of secondary annihilation products , including gamma rays , hadrons , charged leptons and neutrinos , allowing multimessenger searches .",
    "note particularly , that even for dm models designed to be leptophilic , production of hadrons is unavoidable .",
    "( in fact , even for models in which on - shell production of @xmath0 or @xmath1 gauge bosons is kinematically forbidden , some minimal hadron production is inescapable , due to loop processes , or the exchange of off - shell @xmath0 or @xmath1 bosons . )    in this paper we examine a simple example of a model which has a helicity - suppressed @xmath2 cross section , provided by ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "we shall show that in this model , the cross section required to produce positrons in sufficient quantity to account for the observed excess will lead to overproduction of antiprotons and gamma rays , and as such is ruled out as an explanation of the observed positron anomalies . though our calculation is performed for the reference scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect this conclusion to hold for all scenarios in which the dominant positron contributions arise from the 3-body @xmath0/@xmath1-bremsstrahlung final states .",
    "we calculate the spectra of both primary and secondary particles from unsuppressed electroweak ",
    "bremsstrahlung annihilation processes , and calculate the expected spectra and fluxes at earth for a given annihilation cross section . we compare the earthly fluxes with observational data to determine an upper limit on the annihilation cross section . while our analysis techniques are conservative , there are large astrophysical uncertainties in the propagation of charged particles through galactic magnetic fields , and in the dm density profile which probably contains substructure .",
    "a rigorous treatment of these effects is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "consequently , our constraints are illustrative of the upper limit on the cross section , but not robust .",
    "the example model we investigate is the majorana dm version of the leptophilic model proposed in  @xcite . here",
    "the dm consists of a gauge - singlet majorana fermion @xmath20 which annihilates to leptons via the interaction term @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a coupling constant , @xmath23 is the @xmath24-invariant antisymmetric matrix , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 form the new @xmath24 doublet scalar which mediates the annihilation . for simplicity , we consider a coupling to the first generation of leptons only , and set @xmath27 for coupling to the @xmath28 and @xmath29 doublets . as described in @xcite , the @xmath11-wave contribution to the lowest order annihilation process @xmath30",

    "@xcite have shown that this is also the case for the electroweak bremsstrahlung channels @xmath40 . for both @xmath0/@xmath1 and @xmath41 bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the effect is most significant where the dm mass is nearly degenerate with the mass of the boson which mediates the annihilation process . in the high energy limit where the @xmath0/@xmath1 masses are negligible , the cross sections for @xmath0/@xmath1 bremsstrahlung reduce to that for @xmath41 bremsstrahlung , modulo different coupling constants",
    "however , the respective sizes of the electromagnetic and electroweak coupling constants imply that the @xmath0/@xmath1-strahlung cross section is a factor of several larger than that for @xmath41-strahlung , @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 at lower energies , the phase space for @xmath0/@xmath1 bremsstrahlung is somewhat reduced due to the effects of the finite @xmath0/@xmath1 masses .",
    "the bremsstrahlung cross section dominates over that for the lowest order @xmath2 process , provided that @xmath44 does not greatly exceed @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio @xmath46 was plotted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is largest for @xmath47",
    ". however , the @xmath0-strahlung process dominates over the @xmath2 annihilation even if a mild hierarchy between @xmath45 and @xmath44 is assumed , with @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath50 , production of monoenergetic leptons will be subdominant to particles produced in the 3-body processes ( both primary and through gauge boson decay ) , a feature which must be accounted for when analysing astrophysical signatures of these models .",
    "we use the cross sections calculated in @xcite in combination with the pythia code  @xcite to determine the spectra of gamma rays , electrons , protons , and their antiparticles , per annihilation to the five 3-body final states listed above ( one electromagnetic bremsstrahlung and four electroweak bremsstrahlung processes ) . after accounting for propagation effects for the charged particles , we constrain these cross sections by comparing the observed flux with the calculated annihilation signal .",
    "although the spectra of annihilation products which we show are unique to the particular model we have chosen , we expect the results to apply qualitatively to any model where @xmath51-bremsstrahlung is the dominant annihilation mode ( i.e.  where helicity suppression of the @xmath2 @xmath9-wave is lifted by electroweak bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "as mentioned , the model we examine is leptophilic in the @xmath2 process , and therefore has five 3-body bremsstrahlung channels , @xmath52 , which simultaneously contribute to the dm annihilation fluxes .",
    "the cross sections and spectra for the electroweak channels are specified in ref .",
    "@xcite , while those for the electromagnetic channel are given in refs .",
    "the total bremsstrahlung cross section is given by the sum @xmath53 the total bremsstrahlung cross section is a factor of @xmath54 larger than that for photon bremsstrahlung alone , due to the four @xmath0/@xmath1 channels , which are governed by somewhat larger coupling constants .",
    "we shall consider parameters for which the bremsstrahlung channels dominate the total cross section , so that @xmath55 .",
    "we define the `` branching ratio '' for an individual channel @xmath56 as @xmath57 the spectrum per annihilation , for any given annihilation product , @xmath58 , is then given by @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the spectrum per annihilation for a given channel .",
    "the spectra for @xmath61 and @xmath62 include primary annihilation products and secondary annihilation products produced by gauge boson fragmentation .",
    "the spectra for @xmath11 and @xmath63 arise exclusively from gauge boson fragmentation .",
    "the branching ratios and spectra depend on the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "however , as long as the 3-body final states remain the dominant channel , the spectra ( and thus the final results ) have little dependence on this parameter .",

    "finally , the flux of a given annihilation product is schematically @xmath66 the detailed evaluation of these annihilation spectra is given below .",
    "in order to place constraints on the cross section , we need the spectrum of stable particles ( @xmath67 and their antiparticles , plus @xmath41 ) produced per dm annihilation . as an example , we describe how we determine the spectrum of antiprotons per @xmath68 event ; the technique is very similar for other secondary particles , and other electroweak  bremsstrahlung annihilation channels .",

    "the final spectrum is found by averaging the pythia spectra over 10,000 such events .",

    "we have not attempted to model this standard background , so constraints from antiprotons are likely to be significantly stronger than presented here .",
    "annihilation to @xmath152 or @xmath153 is not as helicity - suppressed as to electrons .",
    "even so , the helicity factors which suppress the @xmath9-wave are @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which are comparable to the factor by which the @xmath11-wave is velocity suppressed , @xmath156 . since bremsstrahlung overcomes both suppressions , it can also be important for annihilation to muons and taus .",
    "( and , of course , any helicity suppression is especially stringent for annihilation to @xmath157 and @xmath158 , as @xmath159 . ) in the case of relatively light dm annihilating to taus , the helicity suppression is not as pronounced .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0/@xmath1  bremsstrahlung may be kinematically forbidden . in any case",
    ", we note that annihilation to @xmath160 can never be purely leptophilic , as the @xmath160 has significant hadronic decay modes .    note that in the model we consider , emission of photons or massive gauge bosons can always lift helicity suppression , however the effect will be much greater in magnitude when the dm and scalar exchange particles are nearly degenerate in mass ( such as the co - annihilation region of msugra ) .",
    "in the present work we consider such a region of parameter space .",
    "specifically , we present results for @xmath161 , though our conclusions remain valid for any value of @xmath162 where the bremsstrahlung processes dominate the 2 to 2 body processes . as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rates for these two processes become comparable at @xmath163 .",
    "consider now scenarios where dm annihilation to a lepton pair is _ not _ helicity - suppressed . as examples , one may have majorana dm annihilating via an exchange of a pseudoscalar or scalar ( the latter is still velocity - suppressed at the dm vertex ) or dirac dm annihilating via the exchange of a vector , or one may have scalar dm annihilations . in these cases",
    ", there will still be a signal from electroweak bremsstrahlung emission @xcite , although it will no longer be the dominant channel .",
    "even so , the @xmath51 decay products can still lead to restrictive constraints .",
    "reference  @xcite considered an example ( exchange of a scalar ) where ew bremsstrahlung makes only a subdominant contribution to the total dm annihilation rate . in this model ,",
    "the main contribution to the annihilation rate comes from the 2-body annihilation channels , thus the monoenergetic @xmath7 and neutrino fluxes dwarf the gauge boson fragmentation products .",
    "nonetheless , ref .",
    "@xcite found that the antiproton data still provide the most stringent cross section constraints for certain parameters .",
    "note however , that the models of @xcite explicitly break gauge invariance .",
    "a detailed , model - independent , treatment of weak corrections may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the results presented here are not due to an exhaustive survey of all possible dm profiles and parameters .",
    "uncertainties arise from the various choices made in order to present illustrative results . in most cases ,",
    "we have made conservative choices for these parameters such that alterations to these selections should strengthen the results . in calculating the flux of protons , antiprotons , electrons and positrons ,",
    "all the astrophysical parameters are encoded into a numerically - fit function @xcite with propagation parameters which are consistent with a ` median ' flux @xcite . however , by assuming alternate parameters , e.g. from the ` max ' or ` min ' flux scenarios , our results may be strengthened or weakened by up to an order of magnitude , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : limits - comparison ] .",
    "our conclusions hold in all cases considered , but for the extreme choice of ` min ' diffusion parameter set , where the @xmath164 limits become comparable to those for @xmath165 and the @xmath96 limits become comparable to those for gamma rays .",
    "obviously , the choice of profile can have a large effect on the parameter ranges , and we have adopted the nfw profile with @xmath166 0.39 gev/@xmath167 throughout this work . if one considers nonspherical profiles or dark discs then the uncertainty in the value of the local dm density may be expanded to accommodate a value between 0.2 gev/@xmath167 and 0.7 gev/@xmath167@xcite .",
    "note , however , that changes to the dm profile would move all the predicted fluxes , and thus the corresponding cross section constraints , in the same direction . for",
    "the calculation of the extragalactic fluxes , the cosmic source clustering factor ( @xmath110 of eq.([cosmicflux ] ) ) can vary by an order of magnitude depending on the profile and inclusion or exclusion of subhalos @xcite ( for example , in the case of the moore profile @xcite , our choice for normalization could be increased by a factor of 10 @xcite ) .",
    "this would lead to tighter constraints coming from the gamma - ray signals .",
    "we have also neglected the signals produced by inverse compton scattering ( gamma rays ) and synchrotron radiation ( radiowaves ) of the electrons and positrons as they propagate in the galaxy ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "note , however , that these effects are properly included in the electron energy - loss formalism we adopt .",
    "we expect the gamma rays produced directly from the annihilations to dominate the constraints .",
    "additional gamma rays from inverse compton would only strengthen our results ( but make them less robust ) .",
    "if dm is majorana in nature , then its annihilation to fermions may be suppressed due to helicity considerations . however , when the dm mass is greater than @xmath168 , both electroweak and photon bremsstrahlung may lift this suppression , thereby becoming the dominant channel for dm annihilation .",
    "this permits the indirect detection of models for which the annihilation cross section would otherwise be too suppressed to be of interest .",
    "subsequent decay of the emitted @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge boson will produce fluxes of electrons , positrons , neutrinos , hadrons , and gamma rays .",
    "the aim of the present work has been to study the spectra of these particles as a tool for indirect detection of dm . by comparing these fluxes to cosmic ray data",
    "we have been able to constrain the dm annihilation cross section in such models . from these constraints",
    ", we find that the observational data pertaining to the flux of antiprotons combined with those of positrons make it difficult for helicity - suppressed @xmath2 leptophilic dm annihilation to be the source of the recently detected cosmic ray anomalies . for these models , the bremsstrahlung processes dominate .",
    "the primary culprit is the hadronization of the gauge bosons , which leads to a significant antiproton flux .",
    "this result highlights the difficulty of producing lepton - only final states even in a model expressly designed for just such a purpose with @xmath2 annihilation .",
