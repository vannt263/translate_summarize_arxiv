    "recent discoveries of unconventional electronic behaviour  such as high-@xmath2 superconductivity in the cuprates or colossal magnetoresistance in the manganates  have focused scientific interest on the transition metal oxides . to understand the properties of metallic oxides , it is important to probe the validity of the fermi liquid picture and , if possible , to infer the shape of the fermi surface and other quasiparticle properties .",
    "measurement of the quantum - oscillatory part of the magnetization  the de  haas - van  alphen ( dhva ) effect  is the most direct way to obtain such information .",
    "however , these investigations are difficult as the materials in question are frequently non - stoichiometric and are often only available as very small crystallites .",
    "in particular , sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  has aroused great interest as the only known superconductor with the same ( layered perovskite ) crystal structure as the high-@xmath2 cuprates but without copper.@xcite moreover , it represents a possible candidate for p - wave superconductivity.@xcite sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  is one of the very few complex materials for which there is a good prospect that a deeper physical understanding will soon be achieved .",
    "high - purity stoichiometric crystals can be prepared , and its normal state fermi surface is known to be `` quasi-2d '' , consisting of three slightly warped cylindrical sheets.@xcite    here , we reexamine the dhva effect in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  using piezolever torque magnetometry : a new and ultra - sensitive technique which is especially suited for small microcrystals of anisotropic materials .",
    "it was possible to obtain _ absolute _ estimates for the quantum - oscillatory magnetization on all three fermi surface sheets .",
    "the torque interaction effect and its remarkable manifestation in the `` overcritical '' case will also be discussed .",
    "the fundamental frequency of the quantum - oscillatory torque density ( magnetic torque per unit volume ) corresponding to a fermi surface cylinder in a quasi-2d metal is@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic field which is applied at an angle @xmath5 to the low conductivity axis , @xmath6 is the brillouin zone height ( i.e.  the length of the cylinder ) , @xmath7 the on - axis quasiparticle mass , and @xmath8 the dhva frequency corresponding to the on - axis fermi cylinder cross - section @xmath9 via .",
    "the number @xmath10 represents the damping factors related to finite temperature , sample inhomogeneity , spin - splitting , and the warping of the cylinder.@xcite    to record this small torque , we have employed piezoresistive microcantilever torque magnetometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ simplelever ] .",
    "this technique was pioneered only recently;@xcite we successfully implemented it at low temperatures and achieved quantum - oscillatory moment sensitivities of at 150mk in a 17 t field.@xcite    = 6.5 cm    a small high - quality sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1  crystal ( @xmath11 , residual resistivity about 0.6@xmath12 cm ) , prepared in a floating zone image furnace , was mounted on a piezolever@xcite of dimensions . a second ( empty )",
    "piezolever was used for background compensation in a wheatstone bridge circuit , driven by a 50na amplitude ac current through each lever .",
    "temperatures of 150mk were achieved on a dilution cryostat during field sweeps from 18 t to 15 t .",
    "the output signal and its dhva spectrum for a sweep close ( ) to the @xmath13-axis is shown in fig .",
    "all dhva frequencies observed in the original study@xcite ( which employed the standard field modulation technique ) were reproduced with piezolever torque magnetometry .",
    "one can extract the _ absolute _ quantum - oscillatory magnetization , and we estimate 460a / m , 200a / m , and 30a / m , respectively , as the dhva amplitudes ( at , , and ) for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 sheets  to within a factor of two . these values are in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ lkm ] ) .",
    "for off - axis fields , the magnetization signal is affected by the torque interaction effect which is due to the feedback of the oscillating magnetic moment on the position of the lever in the field.@xcite as a result , the apparent magnetization profile gets sheared , and harmonics and sidebands are introduced to the dhva spectrum . fortunately , this effect can be compensated through numerical treatment of the experimental data . for large @xmath5 and high fields , however , the effect becomes strong enough ( `` overcritical '' ) to produce discrete jumps in the magnetization and hence in the position of the lever , see fig .",
    "[ tioverlay ] .",
    "although observed previously in arsenic,@xcite this remarkably macroscopic manifestation of an inherently quantum phenomenon was visible in our experiments at unprecedented strength .",
    "the `` sproing '' effect at the magnetization jumps  when the lever snaps into its new equilibrium position  was also recorded with a high - speed voltmeter : the lever movement turned out to be near - asymptotically damped by eddy currents .",
    "this casts some doubt on the practicability of proposed `` dynamic mode '' piezolever measurements,@xcite at least on metallic samples .",
    "in conclusion , piezolever torque magnetometry measurements have been able to reproduce the quantum - oscillatory magnetization data on all three fermi surface sheets of the layered perovskite oxide superconductor sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , they provide an absolute estimate of the amplitude of the oscillation .",
    "this introduces the piezolever technique as an interesting alternative to conventional methods for dhva experiments on anisotropic compounds if these are only available as microcrystals  a common situation for complex modern materials .",
    "we also investigated the phenomenon of torque interaction which distorts the magnetization signal and introduces harmonics and sidebands to the dhva spectrum .",
    "as torque interaction grows in strength , it leads to irreversibility effects and discrete magnetization jumps : a near - asymptotically damped `` sproing '' effect ."
