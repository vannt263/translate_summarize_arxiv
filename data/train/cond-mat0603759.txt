    "we focus our attention on a modified version of the @xmath0-spin hamiltonian , the so - called multi-@xmath0-spin model , in which spins do interact in @xmath12-uples with @xmath12 taking more than one value : @xmath13 using the overline for the disorder average , we have that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the overlap among @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the single-@xmath0-spin corresponds to @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) is motivated by the request of an exactly solvable dynamics , for which we need continuous variables interacting in a fully - connected fashion . unlike the single-@xmath0-spin case , in the multi-@xmath0-spin model there is level crossing of metastable states by varying the temperature @xcite .    from a statical point of view , this model is characterized by the presence of a large number of metastable states @xmath19 $ ] . the so - called _ complexity _ @xmath20 is an increasing function of the free - energy @xmath21 which is zero at the lower band edge @xmath22 and maximal for a certain value @xmath23 . for high temperatures the gibbs measure is dominated by the paramagnetic state ( @xmath24 ) , while for @xmath9 ( @xmath1 being the dynamical critical temperature ) , metastable states start to play a relevant role , much in the same way as for the single-@xmath0-spin model . in this region the thermodynamic equilibrium is given by a class of metastable ` equilibrium ' states with finite complexity ( see e.g.ref .  ) , the global free energy of the system thus bearing a contribution from this state - related entropy , i.e.  @xmath25 . lowering still more the temperature , the complexity of the equilibrium states decreases until a point where it becomes zero and the lower band edge states ,",
    "non exponential in number , become dominant .",
    "the temperature where this occurs , @xmath26 , is the static transition temperature for this model , as can be seen also by a direct computation of the partition function with the replica method .",
    "the interpretation of this transition as an ` entropy crisis ' for metastable states is particularly relevant when comparing this model with real systems : indeed fragile glasses do exhibit in this respect a very similar phenomenology .",
    "the structure of metastable states can be investigated in much detail by considering the tap approach , where mean - field equations can be formulated for the local magnetizations @xmath27 ( at fixed disorder realization ) , and stable solutions of these equations identified as states of the system .",
    "recently , some novel intriguing features of this formalism have emerged , according to which metastable states can either satisfy a supersymmetry between fermionic and bosonic integration variables @xcite , either break it @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric ( ss ) states are very robust to external perturbations , while supersymmetry breaking ones ( ssb ) are extremely fragile , and even a small perturbation can dramatically change their number and global structure @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the multi-@xmath0-spin model addressed in this paper , contrary to the single-@xmath0 case , exhibits states of both classes @xcite and allows a comparative study of their role .",
    "in particular , states in the range @xmath28 $ ] are ss , while states with @xmath29 $ ] are ssb .",
    "the free energy level @xmath30 separating the ss from the ssb region , that we shall call _ threshold energy _ , also plays a relevant role in the dynamical behaviour of this system .",
    "another important feature of metastable states , which is more relevant for the questions we want to address , is their behaviour with changing the temperature . for the single-@xmath0-spin spherical model ,",
    "as anticipated above , states can be transposed in temperature and their energy ordering does not change .",
    "there is no birth / death of states with varying the temperature , or , in other words , a tap solution at zero temperature persists when the temperature is turned on until @xmath31 . in the multi-@xmath0-spin model",
    "this is not the case . to investigate more explicitly this point ,",
    "we need a method to ` pin ' out a state and ` follow ' it with varying the temperature .",
    "this can be done by resorting to a dynamical analysis .",
    "given the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) with a generic correlator @xmath32 , it is possible to write the equations for the langevin dynamics at temperature @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a thermal gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath36    given the initial conditions this equation can be solved exactly using the method of the generating functional @xcite .",

    ", however , the most interesting situation is another one .",
    "if we choose the initial condition @xmath43 to belong to a given metastable state , then we can let the system evolve and check whether the state is stable and well - defined ( in which case we expect an equilibrium - like relaxation dynamics inside the state ) or looses stability ( exhibiting off - equilibrium behaviour ) . to this aim @xcite , we may choose an initial condition thermalized at temperature @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 } \\label{dynamics1}\\ ] ] indeed , since for @xmath46 the boltzmann measure is dominated by a class of metastable states , the distribution ( [ dynamics1 ] ) naturally picks out a configuration @xmath47 which belongs to one of such states .",
    "besides , since the class of dominating states varies with the temperature , we can use @xmath48 to select the kind of state ( i.e. energy , complexity and self - overlap ) we want the system to start in .    summarizing , the dynamics that we are considering , described by eqs .",
    "( [ dynamics]-[dynamics1 ] ) , involves two distinct temperatures .",
    "the first one , @xmath11 , controls the thermal noise and therefore represents the temperature at which the dynamical evolution takes place .",
    "the second one , @xmath48 is used to force the system to start into a given metastable state , and to select its properties .",
    "we now analyze the dynamical behaviour of the system by tuning these two parameters .",
    "the case @xmath42 corresponds to random initial conditions , that is to a _",
    "quench_. in this case the system undergoes a dynamical transition at a critical temperature @xmath31 where the relaxation time diverges ( much in the same way as in the single-@xmath0-spin ) .",
    "for @xmath9 the dynamics exhibits aging and asymptotically reaches the threshold states , which have energy density @xmath49 ( corresponding to free energy density @xmath30 ) and self - overlap @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the solution to the marginality condition @xmath52 a similar behaviour occurs for any @xmath53 .",
    "we note that the dynamics following a quench always converges to the edge of the ss region , despite a larger number of ssb states are present at higher energy densities ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "at least two explanations are possible : ( i ) ssb states are `` invisible '' for the dynamics we have solved ; ( ii ) ssb states are marginally unstable ( they have a finite number of zero modes in the thermodynamic limit ) and they are unable to trap the system during the relaxation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath46 , the situation is more complex : as described above the thermodynamic equilibrium is no longer given by the paramagnetic state but rather by a set of metastable states with energy density @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "thus , the initial configuration belongs to one of such states . for @xmath56",
    "the system undergoes an equilibrium dynamics in the state where it was at the starting time . for @xmath57",
    "the initial condition is out of equilibrium and , according to the value of @xmath11 , different dynamical behaviours can be observed . in particular , a critical temperature @xmath58 exists , such that :    \\i ) for @xmath59 the system follows , at large times , an equilibrium relaxation dynamics .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) and ( [ response ] ) can be easily solved exploiting time - translational invariance and the fluctuation - dissipation relation between correlation and response .",
    "the asymptotic regime is then fully described by the two parameters @xmath60 which turn out to be different from zero @xcite , similarly to the single-@xmath0-spin model @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation is clear : the system has been prepared inside an equilibrium state at temperature @xmath48 ; at temperature @xmath11 this state still exists , even if with slightly different features , and the system dynamically relaxes into it . in this view , @xmath61 identifies the self - overlap of the state at temperature @xmath11 , while @xmath62 measures the overlap between the equilibrium state at @xmath48 , where the initial configuration is placed , and the _ same _ state transposed at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath63 the dynamics remains out of equilibrium even for large times , showing aging and violation of the time - translation invariance .",
    "equations for the correlation and the response functions can be written using the same scaling ansatz as the single-@xmath0-spin model @xcite . for asymptotic but close times [ @xmath64 , @xmath65 , time translation invariance is recovered and the parameter @xmath61 can be defined as in eq .",
    "( [ equilibrium ] ) . for asymptotic and well separated times",
    "[ @xmath66 , @xmath67 , the correlation function scales as @xmath68 , with @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 ( the same scaling holding for the response ) .",

    "[ fig : parameters ] for @xmath76 ( the same correlator used in ref .  ) .",
    "@xmath48 has been chosen very close to @xmath1 in order to have a large @xmath77 value .",
    "the first of equations ( [ equazioni ] ) coincides with the marginality condition obeyed by threshold states and defining @xmath51 .",
    "however , the asymptotic dynamical energy @xmath78 that we obtain is different ( and lower ) from the threshold energy @xmath49 , indicating that the asymptotic dynamics takes place in a marginal manifold below the threshold states one .",
    "this feature also holds when @xmath79 , which is relevant for understanding the behaviour of a cooling in this system .",
    "indeed an infinitely slow cooling is able to reach thermal equilibrium at any temperature above and at @xmath1 : is a subtle point : there are no @xmath80 barriers ( states are marginal ) , and so the equilibration time is less than exponential in @xmath4 ( we expect it to grow polynomially with @xmath4 ) . ]",
    "thus for temperatures @xmath11 below @xmath1 an infinitely slow cooling is roughly equivalent to a dynamics starting thermalized at @xmath79 .",
    "our result then indicates that for this system the asymptotic states reached with a cooling are _ lower _ than those reached with a quench .",
    "actually the difference between these asymptotic states is really very tiny ( see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : parameters ] ) . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first analytically solvable model showing up a dependence of the asymptotic dynamical states on the cooling schedule .    , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( curves ) ; the mutual overlap @xmath81 and the self - overlap obtained from the tap complexity computation ( points ) . here",
    "relevant temperature values are : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "inset : difference between asymptotic energies in a quench and a cooling ( see text ) . ]",
    "note also that the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ equazioni ] ) has @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the system never decorrelates completely .",
    "we are observing aging _ together _ with a strong dynamic ergodicity breaking , contrary to the weak - ergodicity breaking scenario analyzed for this kind of models so far @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath87 the initial condition is not forgotten by the aging system and thus the initial condition acts like a magnetic field , inducing @xmath88 .",
    "the change in the dynamical behavior at @xmath89 can be better understood by noticing that @xmath90 as long as @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that states dominating the gibbs measure at @xmath48 are stable for @xmath94 , but at @xmath58 they become marginal , forming a manifold where the system ages on .",
    "for @xmath95 these states become unstable and the system keeps aging in a nearby critical manifold with @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this interpretation also tells us that in the multi-@xmath0-spin model , contrary to the single-@xmath0-spin , it is not possible to ` follow ' any state from @xmath98 to finite temperature , or viceversa , because some states loose stability as the temperature is varied and there may be birth / death of states with temperature .",
    "moreover , changing the temperature the complexity @xmath20 varies along the dynamical trajectory , implying that there is mixing of states .",
    "the variation in @xmath20 is very tiny : e.g.  for @xmath76 is @xmath99 and for this reason it would be hardly visible in a numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "to confirm the interpretation given above and to better understand the dynamical behaviour , we can look more in details at the structure of the metastable states in the region where the asymptotic dynamics occurs .",
    "in particular , we can consider the following static quantity . given a reference state , that will be appropriately chosen as the state to which the initial configuration of the dynamics belongs , we compute the number of metastable states of given free energy density that have fixed mutual overlap with it .",

    "the other delta functions fix respectively the free energy densities and the mutual overlap of the solutions we wish to count .",
    "note also that we have divided by the number of metastable states with free energy @xmath104 in order to get the number of states of free energy @xmath103 with overlap @xmath81 with a _ given _ reference state of kind @xmath100 ( otherwise we would have gotten the number of pairs ) .    the entropy related to ( [ numerotap ] ) , also called _ constrained complexity _ , can be computed using standard techniques @xcite within the annealed approximation , which is in general adequate to treat large free energies @xmath114 ( see appendix [ sec : app ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the entropy can be computed as the legendre transform of a constrained thermodynamic free energy @xcite .",

    "let us now use this constrained entropy to investigate the structure of the phase space sampled by the asymptotic dynamics . to this end , let us fix @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "that is , the reference state is chosen as the state where the dynamics has been started in ( an equilibrium state at temperature @xmath48 ) , while the states to be counted have energy density equal to the asymptotic dynamical energy .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath20 as a function of @xmath81 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexity ] .",
    "we see that two different situations occur above and below @xmath77 .    for @xmath94",
    "the constrained complexity is positive and decreasing with increasing @xmath81 , ( as discussed for the single-@xmath0-spin in ref .  )",
    ", it becomes negative at some value of the mutual overlap and touches back the zero axis for @xmath123 ( see the lowest curve in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : complexity ] ) , with @xmath73 given by the dynamical equations  ( [ equazioni ] ) .",
    "the interpretation is straightforward . for small overlaps we are counting states in a very large manifold , and",
    "we thus find many of them .",
    "as @xmath81 decreases , this manifold becomes smaller and , consequently , the number of counted states decreases until when it becomes zero ( negative complexity ) .",
    "however , if we still increase the overlap , looking closer to the reference state , at some point we are bound to find the state itself .",
    "this is signaled by the zero value of the complexity at @xmath124 , which therefore represents the overlap between the reference state and the _ same _ state evolved at temperature @xmath11 , consistently with the dynamical interpretation . in this point one",
    "also has @xmath125 , with @xmath61 given again by the dynamical equations .",
    "please note that @xmath126 is not the typical value for tap states at temperature @xmath11 and free - energy @xmath127 ; so the dynamics is restricted to a set of sub - dominant states , that can be selected by constraining the tap measure as in ( [ numerotap ] ) .",
    "the interpretation is straightforward : the @xmath48 equilibrium state has evolved in a slightly modified state at temperature @xmath11 , which has overlap @xmath73 with the original one .",
    "this is the _ only _ state ( i.e.  @xmath128 ) that we count at temperature @xmath11 when fixing @xmath123 .",
    "note that this state is stable ( by computing the replicon ) and it is `` isolated '' , that is the @xmath20 curve is negative in the @xmath129 plane around the point @xmath130 .",

    "fig : complexity ] ) and the @xmath133 region in the @xmath129 plane ( with @xmath104 fixed ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] .",
    "the @xmath48 equilibrium state opens up at @xmath134 and a non trivial structure of metastable states appears close to where the dynamics is taking place ; these states are responsible for the aging behavior , but it is still unclear which are the thermodynamical parameters of the dynamical asymptotic states .",
    "this is the main question when trying to describe the dynamical behavior in terms of static observations .    we know that for @xmath135 the dynamics is taking place on a marginal manifold , so we can fix @xmath136 : states with this self - overlap are found along the full line in fig.[fig : region ] .",
    "all the points along this line are possible candidates for the asymptote of the dynamics , but understanding which one is actually chosen during system relaxation is a difficult task .",
    "consistently with the dynamical computation the point @xmath130 is always on the line .",
    "moreover , at this point , @xmath137 holds , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the dynamical fluctuation - dissipation ratio .",
    "it seems that at least one dynamically computed quantity must be plugged in the static computation to predict the asymptotic states : this can be equivalently @xmath123 or @xmath137 ( for a quench the computation is easier : starting with a random configuration one has @xmath140 by definition ) .",
    "it would be very useful to find an extremizing principle to select , among all the candidate tap states , those which are actually reached by the constrained out of equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the spherical multi-@xmath0-spin model defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) has the nice properties of being exactly solvable ( thanks to its continuous variables ) , while showing non - trivial dependence on temperature of its states ( birth , death and level crossing ) .",
    "these features makes the model more realistic than other mean - field models and a perfect candidate for studying glassy relaxation under variations of temperature .",
    "we have performed such a study finding several interesting analytical results .",
    "( i ) the relaxation at any temperature converges to tapstates satisfying the supersymmetry between fermionic and bosonic integration variables . in order to understand whether tap  states breaking the supersymmetry are relevant for _ finite times _ dynamics , the method described in ref .",
    "could be applied to the present model .",

    "this result is based on the assumption than an infinitely slow cooling equilibrates at any temperature @xmath141 , which needs to be improved .",
    "( iii ) the solution to the dynamical equations is consistent with the constrained complexity of tap  states computed thermodynamically : starting from a thermalized configuration and lowering the temperature , the system starts aging when the state it belongs to becomes marginally unstable . for lower temperatures , states where aging is taking place can not be predicted solely from the constrained complexity ; a new extremizing principle is needed in order to make the connection between static and dynamic computations .",

    "<S> we give a full description of this constrained out of equilibrium behavior and we clarify the connection to the thermodynamics by computing ( sub - dominant ) tap states , constrained to the starting equilibrium configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> many interesting physical systems live for very long times out of equilibrium , and , in this regime , they display highly non trivial behaviors which are still to be understood ( e.g.  rejuvenation and memory effects in spin glasses ) . in general , these systems fall out of equilibrium when some external parameter is changed . </S>",
    "<S> for example , fragile glass - forming liquids undergo a dramatic slowing down of their relaxational dynamics when the temperature is dropped below the glass transition temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is sharpened in certain mean - field models where , at a critical temperature @xmath1 , a transition occurs from an equilibrium kind of dynamics to an off - equilibrium aging one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon is ubiquitous and can be found also in very different fields : e.g.  in local search algorithms for solving hard optimization problems the time - complexity may become extremely large by varying a macroscopic parameter @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the dramatic slowing down in out of equilibrium dynamics is a subject of broad interest and wide applicability .    in describing the dynamical slowing down ( and possible eventual arrest ) </S>",
    "<S> the common view suggests that at a low temperature a huge number of metastable states appears ( with energies higher than the equilibrium one , @xmath2 ) , making relaxation to equilibrium very slow , and even impossible if interactions are long ranged and metastable states life - times diverge in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> this picture has been verified by solving the out of equilibrium langevin dynamics of a particularly simple mean - field model , the so - called fully connected spherical @xmath0-spin , whose hamiltonian is @xcite @xmath3 where the @xmath4 spins @xmath5 are continuous variables subject to the spherical constraint @xmath6 and the couplings are i.i.d.random variables with zero mean and variance @xmath7 . in this model ( hereafter @xmath8 ) if we consider a _ </S>",
    "<S> quench _ </S>",
    "<S> , that is if we choose an initial configuration of high energy and let the system relax at a _ fixed _ value of the temperature @xmath9 ( @xmath1 being the dynamic transition temperature ) , the asymptotic dynamics remains trapped at the energy level of the highest and most numerous metastable states , the so - called _ threshold states_. time - translation invariance and the dynamic fluctuation - dissipation relation are violated and aging is observed in correlation and response functions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> these features are intriguing and experimentally relevant , since aging behaviour has been observed in many disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in order to compare with more realistic situations it is extremely useful to understand the dynamical behaviour during a _ </S>",
    "<S> cooling_. in this case the system relaxes while the temperature is slowly decreased from an initial high value to a final temperature below @xmath1 .    in the single-@xmath0-spin model , defined by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamsingle ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , changing the temperature during the dynamics has no effect on the asymptotic states approached by the relaxing system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily understood by considering the structure of metastable states . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to a particular symmetry , at any temperature @xmath10 the ordering ( in free - energy ) of the metastable states is the same they have ( in energy ) at zero temperature @xcite . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the metastable threshold states , those where the out of equilibrium dynamics converges to , are the same at any temperature below @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for this very reason , the single-@xmath0-spin model can be considered as pathological . in more realistic systems , when the temperature ( or any other external parameter ) varies , metastable states may appear / disappear and their ordering is no longer preserved . for such systems , many questions on the dynamical behaviour </S>",
    "<S> are still open : for example , it is not clear what is the asymptotic state of the off - equilibrium dynamics if the temperature varies during the relaxation and whether such asymptotic state can be computed directly from the thermodynamical measure ( i.e.  statically ) , without solving the dynamical equations . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we try to give some answers to the above points .    a last comment on the relevance of the present work concerns the difference between a cooling and a quench . </S>",
    "<S> the common experience ( exploited by the simulated annealing method ) tells us that , in the same amount of _ finite _ time , the cooling is able to reach lower energies than the quench . but what happens in the large times limit ? in the single-@xmath0-spin model the answer is simple : any cooling scheme , included the quench , converges to threshold states , which are @xmath11-independent . on the contrary , if threshold states vary with temperature , the answer was unclear and we show analytically that the asymptotic state may depend on the cooling scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : model ] describes the model we want to study and summarizes what was already known about it ; in section [ sec : dyn ] we write and solve the equation for the out of equilibrium dynamics , starting from a thermalized configuration ; in section [ sec : statics ] we report the results of the computation of the number of tap states , constrained to a fixed distance from a reference state ( more details are given in appendix [ sec : app ] ) and we compare these results with the solution of the dynamical equations ; finally in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and give some future perspective . </S>"
