    "more than @xmath0 of all bright nearby galaxies are disk - dominated systems .",
    "bars are seen in about @xmath0 of them . this is also true at higher redshift .",
    "in fact , the bar fraction is constant out to @xmath1 ( see ( * ? ? ? * marinova & jogee 2006 ) and references therein ) .",
    "therefore bars are a common feature in the central regions of disk galaxies .",
    "their growth is partly regulated by the exchange of angular momentum with the stellar disk and the dark matter ( dm ) halo . for this reason",
    "the dynamical evolution of bars can be used to constrain the content and distribution of dm in the inner regions of galaxy disks .",
    "the morphology and dynamics of a barred galaxy depend on the pattern speed of the bar , @xmath2 .",
    "usually , it is parametrized with the bar rotation rate @xmath3 .",
    "this is the distance - independent ratio between the corotation radius , @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the disk circular velocity ) , and the length of bar semi - major axis , @xmath6 . at @xmath7",
    "the gravitational and centrifugal forces cancel out in the rest frame of the bar .",
    "as far as the value of @xmath8 concerns , if @xmath9 the stellar orbits are elongated perpendicular to the bar and the bar dissolves . for this reason",
    ", self - consistent bars can not exist in this regime .",
    "bars with @xmath10 are close to rotate as fast they can , and there is not a priori reason for @xmath8 to be significantly larger than 1.0 . the knowledge of @xmath8 allows to distinguish between fast bars ( @xmath11 ) and slow bars ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this choice does not imply anything about the actual rotation velocity of bar .",
    "a variety of indirect methods has been used to measure @xmath2 and corresponding @xmath8 .",
    "they are based on the identification of morphological features with the location of lindblad s resonances , comparison of the observed gas velocity and density fields with numerical models of gas flows , and analysis of the offset and shape of dust lanes which traces the location shocks in the gas flows .",
    "all these methods are model dependent and are mostly used for late - type barred galaxies because they rely on the presence of gas .",
    "nearly all the measured bars are found to be fast ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elmegreen 1996 ) for a review ) .",
    "a model - independent method for measuring @xmath2 is the tremaine - weinberg method ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) , tw ) .",
    "they showed that if a tracer satisfies the continuity equation , then @xmath2 is determined from two observationally accessible quantities : the luminosity - weighted mean of positions @xmath13 and the luminosity - weighted mean of line - of - sight velocities @xmath14 of the tracer .",
    "it is @xmath15 with @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cartesian coordinates chosen to be aligned with the observed major and minor axis of the galaxy disk .",
    "the position @xmath17 , velocity @xmath19 , and surface brightness @xmath20 of the tracer are measured along a strip which is parallel to the disk major axis and offset by @xmath18 .",
    "this strip actually corresponds to the aperture of either a slit or a pseudo - slit in long - slit and integral - field spectroscopy , respectively .",
    "plotting @xmath14 versus @xmath13 for the different strips produces a straight line with slope @xmath21 .",
    "the inclination @xmath22 of the galaxy disk is derived from the analysis of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "the assumption underlying the tw method is that the observed surface brightness is proportional to the surface density of the tracer , as for old stellar populations in the absence of significant and patchy obscuration of dust .",
    "thus , the method has been applied largely to absorption - line spectra of early - type barred galaxies ( table 1 ) .",
    "all the objects listed in table  1 are bright galaxies , except for ngc  4431 .",
    "@xcite found that the probability that the bar of this dwarf galaxy ends close to its corotation radius ( i.e. , it is fast ) is about twice as likely as that the bar is much shorter than corotation radius ( i.e. , it is slow ) .",
    "a fast bar in ngc  4431 would suggest a common formation mechanism of the bar both in bright and dwarf galaxies .",
    "if their disks were previously stabilized by massive dm halos , bars were not produced by tidal interactions because they would be slowly rotating ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* noguchi 1999 ) ) .",
    "but , this is not the case even for galaxies which show signs of weak tidal interaction with a close companion ( e.g. , ngc  4431 and ngc  1023 ) .",
    "this finding implies there is no difference between tw measurements of the stellar component in isolated or mildly interacting barred galaxies .",
    "all the measured bars are consistent with being in fast .",
    "this is particularly true when galaxies with small uncertainties on @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xmath23 ) are considered .",
    "most of the studied sb0 bulges have the photometric and kinematic properties of classical bulges ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* aguerri et al . 2005 ) ) . in particular , they follow the faber - jackson correlation , lie on the fundamental plane and those for which stellar kinematics are available rotate as fast as the bulges of unbarred galaxies .",
    "the remaining bulges have disk properties typical of pseudobulges .",
    "a successful application of the tw method to the stellar component of late - type barred galaxies will remedy the selection bias present in the current sample of directly measured pattern speeds .",
    "this problem could be addressed by using near - infrared spectroscopy in order to deal with dust obscuration .",
    "in fact , according to @xcite realistic values of dust attenuation change the observed @xmath2 by less than 30 per cent .",
    "extensions of the tw method to multiple pattern speeds were proposed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they can be applied to measure pattern speeds of nested bars , as in ngc  2950 .",
    "the primary bar of this double - barred galaxy has a smaller pattern speed than the secondary one , which is possibly counterrotating ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corsini et al . 2003 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* maciejewski 2006 ) ) .    in most cases",
    "the presence of shocks , conversion of gas between different phases , and star formation on short timescales prevent the application of the tw method to gas .",
