    "a series of experiments in the late 1960s and in the 1970s discovered that molecular fluorescence and raman scattering could be enhanced close to metal surfaces  @xcite .",
    "these pioneering efforts spurred a fury of theoretical works in the subsequent years to understand and explain the phenomena encountered in surface - enhanced spectroscopy @xcite . among various effects ,",
    "these efforts identified field enhancement at sharp edges and surface roughness as a source of stronger fluorescence excitation and emission . it was also predicted that plasmon resonances in metallic films and nanostructures could enhance these effects further .",
    "moreover , fluorescence quenching and the modification of the emission quantum yield due to the absorption in real metals were investigated theoretically .",
    "for all these effects , one discovered a very strong influence on the emitter orientation and position with respect to the metallic structure under study .",
    "these steep dependencies , which are inherent to near - field interactions , posed a great challenge to the experimental verification and quantitative understanding of surface - enhanced phenomena because they could not be controlled in ensemble measurements . as a result",
    ", only the large enhancement factors had to be deduced from averaging measurements .",
    "the advent of scanning near - field optical microscopy ( snom )  @xcite and single molecule spectroscopy  @xcite in the 1980s and their maturation in the 1990s provided the experimental tools for controlled laboratory investigation of surface - enhanced interactions . in 2004 we succeeded , for the first time , to examine the enhancement of fluorescence from a single oriented molecule as a function of its precise three - dimensional ( 3d ) location close to a single gold nanoparticle . to do this",
    ", we placed a single gold nanosphere at the end of a glass fiber tip  @xcite and used scanning probe microscopy to position it in the near field of single molecules embedded in a thin film .",
    "in an extended series of measurements we investigated the shortening of the fluorescence lifetime , the modification of the emission spectrum , the change in the emission pattern , dependence of the excitation rate on the illumination wavelength within the plasmon resonance , and the size of the gold nanoparticle  @xcite .",
    "these studies showed that a spherical gold particle acts as a nanoantenna that modifies the excitation rate , the spontaneous emission rate , the emission spectrum , and the radiation pattern of an emitter in its near field .",
    "indeed , several other groups have also investigated single molecule fluorescence in the near field of well - defined scanning probes , which function as optical antennas  @xcite .",
    "the concept of optical antennas is closely linked to the physics of near - field microscopy , in which a tip mediates between a far - field illumination and the sample in its subwavelength vicinity  @xcite .",
    "progress in nanofabrication has motivated the realization of structures similar to radiowave antennas,@xcite for operating in the optical domain  @xcite although various issues have to be considered .",
    "for example , metal nanoparticles support localized surface plasmon - polariton ( lspp ) modes that depend on the nanoparticle shape , composition and surroundings.@xcite moreover , losses due to absorption by real metals are not negligible at optical frequencies.@xcite in addition , the molecule is coupled to the antenna via the displacement current , which is strongly position and orientation dependent  @xcite . in this respect , there are ongoing efforts to reconcile these differences with standard antenna theory.@xcite    recently , we proposed a few simple rules for designing optical antennas to enhance spontaneous emission by more than three orders of magnitude while avoiding quenching@xcite",
    ". first , the plasmon resonance should be in a spectral region where dissipation in the metal is small .",
    "second , the nanoparticle should have sharp corners to strongly increase the near field .",
    "third , the antenna and the molecule dipole moment should be aligned in a head - to - tail configuration to maximize coupling and radiation .",
    "fourth , the structure should be compatible with state - of - the - art nanofabrication .",
    "we then performed a detailed analysis of nanorods and nanospheroids for enhancing fluorescence by varying their aspect ratio and composition .",
    "we found that nanospheroids perform better than nanorods when the plasmon resonance needs to be shifted towards shorter wavelengths@xcite .",
    "moreover , by choosing different plasmonic materials , such as aluminum , silver , copper and gold , we could obtain large purcell effects and quantum efficiencies in a broad spectral region , from ultraviolet to near infrared@xcite .",
    "one of the issues that we identified is that the antenna efficiency @xmath0 , which is the power that reaches the far field divided by the total emitter power , and the purcell factor @xmath1 , which represents the enhancement of the radiative decay rate , are maximal for different antenna parameters .",
    "in particular , we found that for gold nanorods and nanospheroids increasing @xmath0 involves a rapid decrease of @xmath1 in the visible and near - infrared range@xcite .",
    "the question now is if one can improve the antenna design to increase @xmath1 without decreasing @xmath0 and losing control on the spectral position of the resonance . in this work",
    ", we propose that a simple solution based on using a nanocone , where one end can be sharp to increase the field enhancement and the purcell factor , while the other larger end increases the volume , and thus , the antenna efficiency@xcite .",
    "the nanocone antenna is similar to the ( bi- ) conical antenna , which is the canonical example of a broadband antenna for applications in the vhf and uhf frequency bands.@xcite however , for practical reasons such as the antenna weight , it is often realized in the form of a bow - tie .",
    "finite and semi - infinite metal nanocones are not a new concept in optics and snom.@xcite for example , conical snom probes could be exploited to focus surface plasmon - polaritons down to a spot size limited only by the tip curvature.@xcite moreover , the field enhancement for semi - infinite@xcite and finite@xcite silver nanocones has been studied as a function of the cone angle . in both situations , like for the bow - tie@xcite",
    ", there exists an optimal angle that maximizes the enhancement .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out that a finite nanocone can give rise to a stronger field than a semi - infinite one because of the lspp resonance effect.@xcite other groups investigated the modification of fluorescence lifetime by semi - infinite metal tips,@xcite where coupling to the surface plasmon - polariton mode leads to quenching . also for finite nanocones , previous investigations concluded that quenching dominates at the lspp resonance.@xcite    here , we concentrate our attention on finite 3d gold nanocones to demonstrate that they can actually exhibit very interesting performances in terms of purcell effect and antenna efficiency at the lspp wavelength .",
    "in particular , we discuss the role of @xmath0 in determining the optimal angle for enhancing fluorescence .",
    "first , we briefly review the theory and computational approach for studying spontaneous emission and molecular fluorescence with an optical antenna .",
    "second , we investigate @xmath1 and @xmath0 of single and double gold nanocones as a function of cone angle .",
    "we then discuss the role of the emitter intrinsic quantum efficiency @xmath2 , which together with @xmath1 and @xmath0 determines the effective quantum efficiency and the fluorescence enhancement .",
    "lastly , we explore the effect of a supporting substrate and of rounding the tip .",
    "we consider an isolated emitter with radiative decay rate @xmath3 , nonradiative decay rate @xmath4 and quantum efficiency @xmath5 .",
    "the presence of a metal nanostructure modifies the spontaneous emission rate and introduces an additional non - radiative decay channel with rate @xmath6 due to absorption in the metal.@xcite the new radiative decay rate @xmath7 and the quantum efficiency @xmath8 can be related to the initial values by the following expression@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the purcell factor and @xmath11 is the antenna efficiency . under",
    "weak excitation , the fluorescence signal of the isolated emitter is @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 represents the collection efficiency , @xmath14 is the transition electric dipole moment , and @xmath15 is the electric field at the emitter position . with an optical antenna , the local electric field and the collection efficiency",
    "get also modified and the signal becomes @xmath16.@xcite assuming that the signal is collected over all angles , such that @xmath17 , the fluorescence enhancement reads @xmath18 furthermore , if the metal nanostructure and the emitter are arranged in a configuration that almost preserves the dipolar radiation pattern of the isolated emitter,@xcite reciprocity implies that @xmath19 can be well approximated by replacing the electric field enhancement @xmath20 with the purcell factor @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we thus write @xmath21 from eqs .",
    "( [ fluo1 ] ) and ( [ fluo2 ] ) one immediately notes that the maximum fluorescence and the maximum field enhancements do not correspond because of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath1 and @xmath0 is performed here using the body - of - revolution ( bor ) finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method , which exploits the cylindrical symmetry of the nanocones to significantly reduce the computational burden in comparison to standard 3d - fdtd methods@xcite .",
    "the computational details can be found in ref .   and references therein .",
    "we focus our attention on gold@xcite optical antennas made of one or two finite nanocones .",
    "the emitter is always at 10 nm from the sharp end of the nanocone , unless otherwise specified , and it is positioned and oriented along the nanocone axis .",
    "this distance is chosen in order to ignore effects due to nonlocality in the optical constants of the metal interface@xcite and convergence issues in the fdtd method.@xcite the mesh pitch is 1 nm or 0.5 nm , depending on the nanocone geometry . for the case of an optical antenna made of two nanocones , the gap between them is fixed to 20 nm .",
    "the nanocone dimensions are chosen such that the lspp is placed in the visible and near - infrared spectral range .",
    "the surrounding material is either glass ( refractive index 1.5 ) or air .",
    "[ smallcone ] displays the purcell factor @xmath1 and the antenna efficiency @xmath0 for single and double nanocone antennas in glass as a function of the nanocone base @xmath22 and the wavelength .",
    "the nanocone height is 80 nm and the tip end is flat with a fixed diameter of 20 nm .",
    "the black curves correspond to the case of a nanorod@xcite .",
    "starting from this structure , the purcell factor increases slightly and then decreases , confirming that there exists an optimal value for @xmath22@xcite .",
    "this trend is found for optical antennas made of one and two nanocones , as shown in [ smallcone](b ) and [ smallcone](d ) .",
    "however , [ smallcone](a ) and [ smallcone](c ) reveal that @xmath0 steadily grows with @xmath22 because the volume of the nanostructure increases . intuitively , that occurs since scattering is proportional to the volume squared , while absorption only to the volume@xcite . therefore ,",
    "if both f and @xmath0 have to be considered in the assessement of the antenna performances , one sees that @xmath22 might be different than the optimal value found when only the field enhancement is taken into account .",
    "the dips in [ smallcone](a ) and [ smallcone](c ) are associated with the excitation of higher - order resonances , which increase the non - radiative decay rate more strongly than the radiative one  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage with respect to nanorods and nanospheroids is that here the resonance can be tuned towards the visible spectrum simply by changing the nanocone angle , without a significant loss of enhancement .",
    "indeed , for nanorods we found that shifting the resonance by 100 nm can lead to a reduction of @xmath1 by more than a factor of two.@xcite    single , ( a ) and ( b ) , and double , ( c ) and ( d ) , conical optical antennas in glass ( refractive index 1.5 ) .",

    "the redshift due to a longer optical antenna is compensated by a lower refractive index so that the resonances are in the same spectral region of those shown in [ smallcone ] .",
    "the overall behavior as a function of @xmath22 is similar to the previous case .",
    "the main difference here is that the purcell factor rises to as high as 2000 for a single nanocone and 8000 for a double nanocone antenna .",
    "such large values combined with a very good antenna efficiency and a wide spectral tunability of the lspp make them ideal systems for enhancing the radiative properties of solid - state quantum emitters .",

    "( [ fluo2 ] ) , the fluorescence enhancement depends on @xmath1 , on @xmath0 , and on the initial quantum efficiency @xmath2 .",
    "we anticipated that the value of @xmath22 that maximizes @xmath1 should not correspond to the value that maximizes @xmath19 . to discuss this point further we plot in [ fluocone ] the fluorescence enhancement as a function of the nanocone base diameter @xmath22 and @xmath2 . for each @xmath22",
    "we choose the wavelength associated with the maximum @xmath1 .",
    "for the same wavelength , we also take @xmath0 and use these quantities in eq .",

    "@xmath19 is maximal when @xmath22 is about 30 nm in place of 24 nm obtained for @xmath1 ( see the bold black curve ) .",
    "the difference is small because @xmath1 is so large that eq .",
    "( [ fluo2 ] ) can be well approximated by @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath0 does not change much compared to @xmath1 , it turns out that maximizing @xmath1 and @xmath19 give similar values for @xmath22 .",
    "this can also be inferred from the quantum efficiency @xmath8 , which is shown by dashed curves in [ fluocone ] .",
    "@xmath8 is close to @xmath0 , corresponding to the curve for @xmath24% , even when @xmath25% . for smaller purcell factors ,",

    "the optical antenna gap for the case of two nanocones is 20 nm .",
    "see the inset to [ largecone ] for details on the coupling geometry.,width=311 ]      an important aspect for the experimental realization of nanoantennas is the effect of a supporting substrate .",
    "often , the optical antenna is grown on a dielectric substrate,@xcite or is attached to the end of a fiber.@xcite previous works concluded that the presence of a substrate has a negligible effect on the field enhancement and on the spectral position of the lspp for nanocones.@xcite here , in [ subs ] , we show that adding a glass substrate can shift the resonance by more than 50 nm .",
    "furthermore , the lspp exhibits a stronger radiative broadening , which decreases the purcell factor @xmath1 and the field enhancement,@xcite and increases the antenna efficiency @xmath0 .",

    "the insets in ( a ) and ( b ) sketch the antenna cross section , indicating the emitter position and orientation , and the nanocone parameter that is varied.,width=311 ]      the last important aspect that we would like to address is the effect of the tip termination .",
    "previous studies on the field enhancement in triangular nanoparticles have shown that changing the tip termination can affect the results.@xcite here , we compare the case of a flat tip , shown in [ tip](a ) , with the case of a rounded tip having the same diameter , as shown in [ tip](b ) .",
    "we see that the resonance frequency and the antenna efficiency @xmath0 are almost the same .",
    "the only noticeable difference occurs for the purcell factor @xmath1 , which is larger for the case of a flat tip .",
    "this holds also if the flat and rounded ends have a diameter of 10 nm in place of 20 nm .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between the two situations is not huge . indeed ,",
    "when the emitter is only 6 nm from the metal surface , the 20 nm rounded tip yields a stronger field enhancement in comparison to the flat one .",
    "these results stem essentially from the complex behavior of the electric field close to a metal tip  @xcite .",
    "effect of the tip termination on nanocone optical antennas in air .",

    "the emitter is at a distance of 6 or 10 nm from the end of the tip .",
    "the insets in ( a ) and ( b ) sketch the antenna cross section , indicating the emitter position and orientation , and the varied nanocone parameters.,width=311 ]",
    "we investigated the performance of gold nanocones as optical antennas for enhancing molecular fluorescence . compared to nanorods and nanospheroids",
    ", the great advantage of nanocones is that the spectral position of the lspp can be tuned towards shorter wavelengths by increasing the cone angle without compromising the purcell factor and reducing the antenna efficiency .",
    "another important practical aspect in favor of nanocones is the increased robustness and stability for vertical orientation because the base is larger than for nanorods.@xcite    moreover , we have shown that an optimal angle for the purcell factor exists , which is directly related to the field enhancement studied in previous works.@xcite we have also studied the antenna efficiency , showing that quenching does not necessarily occur in correspondence with the lspp.@xcite while @xmath1 increases and then decreases with increasing cone angle , @xmath0 exhibits a monotonic growths .",
    "therefore , because the fluorescence signal depends on the local electric field and on the quantum efficiency , the maximum field and fluorescence enhancements do not occur for the same cone angle .",
    "nevertheless , we found that this difference is small if the purcell factor is much larger than 1 , which is easy to achieve using realistic nanocone parameters .",
    "the strong fluorescence and field enhancement as well as the electric field localization at the nanocone tip holds great promise for high - resolution fluorescence , raman , and other nonlinear nanoscopies.@xcite in fact , finite nanocones could be very efficiently butt - coupled to a dielectric nanofiber or interfaced with a weakly - focused radially - polarized beam for the realization of a high - throughput and large - bandwidth scanning near - field optical microscope@xcite .",
    "considering the recent progress in the fabrication of single and double gold nanocone on substrates,@xcite cantilevers,@xcite and on the facet of optical fibers,@xcite we anticipate a great deal of activity on this antenna system .",
