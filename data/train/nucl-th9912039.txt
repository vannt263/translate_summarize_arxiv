    "mutual relations between @xmath72 and temperature as well as between @xmath73 and @xmath41 result in dependence of functions @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 on the dimensionless fermi momentum @xmath21 and the temperature @xmath77 .",
    "+ when the temperature equals zero the shapiro for result free nucleons can be reproduced @xcite @xmath78 which in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath79 yields @xmath80 and the equation of state takes the form of the polytrope @xmath81 .",
    "the forms of the functions @xmath74 , @xmath76 and @xmath75 indicate their relations with the functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 which are used in order to evaluate thermodynamic properties of the matter @xcite",
    "@xmath84 @xmath85 the case where the interaction in the lagrange function ( [ lag ] ) is neglected ( free nucleons ) is equivalent to the one where @xmath20 in equations ( [ egg1],[egg2 ] ) .",

    "the final forms of the function emerge : @xmath100 @xmath101 in order to calculate the contribution of electrons to the total pressure @xmath59 and the energy density @xmath58 , the relativistic case should be considered . in this very case",
    "the variable @xmath72 tends to zero .",
    "it is necessary to calculate the mentioned above functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the relativistic limit , where again the method used by weldon in @xcite , @xcite has been involved .",

    "the identity @xmath108 originated from dolan and jackiw @xcite gives us the possibility to write the functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 as @xmath111dz}{[z^{2}+y^{2}(1-r^{2})+(2n+1)^{2}\\pi ^{2}]^{2}+4\\pi ^{2}r^{2}y^{2}(2n+1)^{2}}}\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath112dz}{[z^{2}+y^{2}(1-r^{2})+(2n+1)^{2}\\pi ^{2}]^{2}+4\\pi ^{2}r^{2}y^{2}(2n+1)^{2}}}\\ ] ] the integrands in these equations are multiplied by the convergent factor @xmath113 and after its expansion as a power series in @xmath72 the term by term integration is performed . in the next step the summation over @xmath114 is carried out . in the last stage",
    "the limit @xmath115 enables us to obtain the final result which in the first approximation achieves the form of @xmath116 @xmath117 knowing the form of functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 and the initial conditions ( [ eq4 ] ) it is possible to calculate the functions @xmath107 , @xmath106 , @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 these functions are employed to express the electron pressure and energy density according to the equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "consequently the relation between the total pressure @xmath59 being the sum of the leptons and nucleons pressures and the dimensionless fermi momentum @xmath21 is presented in fig.2 .",
    "the curves in fig , 2 are parameterized by the temperature and @xmath20 .",

    "+ introduction of the dimensionless variable @xmath131 which is connected with the variable @xmath73 by the relation @xmath132 ( @xmath133 km ) enables us to define the functions @xmath126 , @xmath128 and @xmath127 in the following form @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 some more parameters , namely @xmath137 @xmath138 and @xmath139 are also needed to achieve the useful form of the otv equation @xmath140 with @xmath141 these equations can be solved specifying the central neutron energy density being the energy density for @xmath142 .",
    "+ the equation of state is the function of the temperature and the neutron chemical potential which changes with the radius @xmath73 . therefore the changes of the radius influence the parameters of the star . using the results",
    "obtained in previous chapter it is now possible to write the functions @xmath126 and @xmath128 in the form @xmath143 @xmath144 and the variable @xmath21 can be obtained @xmath145 @xmath146 the function @xmath147 takes the form @xmath148 the solution of the oppenheimer - volkoff - tolman equation depicts the mass - radius relation .",

    ". shows the changes of the radius as a function of the neutron density @xmath149 in the center of the star .",
    "herein presented solutions of the oppenheimer - volkoff - tolman equations of hydrostatic equilibrium concern hot neutron stars .",
    "the neutron star matter in this model consists of neutrons , protons and leptons ( electrons , muons ) being in @xmath42- equilibrium under the assumption that the temperature is different from zero .",
    "it varies from 0 to 50 mev .",
    "the objective of our work was to study the influence of the temperature on the main parameters of a neutron star . in order to achieve the proper form of the equation of state , which is determined only by the neutron fermi momentum ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate either the low temperature or the high temperature expansion of the integrals ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "this very simple model presents a few global properties of the hot neutron star such as the mass and the size.the parameters of neutron stars obtained in this simplified model considering zero temperature and cases of finite temperatures vary from one another . in each of the mentioned above cases",
    "stars with the same energy density inside are considered . however , their baryon numbers are different which makes each of them a different star with specific baryon number . in this situation",
    "we do not deal with the thermal evolution of one star with conserved baryon number but several separate cases .",
    "the star whose parameters at the temperature of 50 mev are as follows : for @xmath19 @xmath150 @xmath151 , for @xmath152 @xmath153 , @xmath154 at zero temperature limit the star is characterized by the mass @xmath155 and the radius @xmath156 for @xmath19 and the mass @xmath157 and radius @xmath158 for @xmath152 .",
