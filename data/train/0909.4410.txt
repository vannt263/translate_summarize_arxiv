    "in recent years , a series of papers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , wk06 from now on ) have proposed that the stellar content of an entire galaxy may not be well described by the same initial mass function ( imf ) that describes the distribution of stellar masses in the star clusters , where these stars form .",
    "the reason is that star clusters also form with a cluster mass function ( cmf ) , which is a power law with a power law index of @xmath0 .",
    "if the lower cluster mass limit is very low ( in the mass range that is also occupied by single stars , i.e. below 100 @xmath1 , and under the assumption that the most massive star in a cluster can not be more massive than its host cluster ) , the low mass clusters will be deficient in high mass stars . therefore ,",
    "if the stellar content of all clusters is added up , resulting in the integrated galactic initial mass function ( igimf ) , the distribution of stellar masses may be steeper at the high mass end , depending on the exact shape of the cmf .",
    "the exact form of the igimf could have profound implications for the integrated properties of galaxies .",
    "high mass stars are important for galaxies , both in terms of their energy output ( massive stars are bright and explode in supernova explosions ) and in terms of the chemical enrichment . assuming an igimf instead of an imf , the she supernova rate and chemical enrichment of galaxies are studied by @xcite , the relation between h@xmath2 and uv luminosity in star forming disks by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigates [ @xmath3 fe ] abundance ratios for igimfs .    in most of these earlier studies , the assumed cmf and sampling method",
    "are kept the same",
    ". for sampling they use the method ` sorted sampling ' , which was put forward by wk06 , as they found it to best fit the relation between the most massive star in a cluster and the cluster mass .",
    "the cmf was assumed to be a pure power - law with index -2.2 and a lower cluster mass limit of 5@xmath1 .    in this contribution",
    ", we will vary the sampling method and the cmf parameters and investigate the resulting igimfs .",
    "also , we will estimate the observability of the effects of sampling method and cmf variations through the number count of o - stars as will be observed by gaia , the integrated photometry of distant galaxies and the chemical enrichment of galaxies ( in terms of total gas phase metallicity ) .",
    "as a default choice for the cmf , we will use the same cmf as used before : + @xmath4 , with a lower mass limit of 5@xmath1 . for computational simplicity",
    "we use the salpeter imf for stars , between 0.1 and 100@xmath1 .",
    "we test several sampling methods ( italic parts are the descriptions used in the figure later on ) :    1 .",
    "random sampling until the cluster mass is reached . as this will never get exactly to the cluster mass aimed for , we either include the last star ( _ stop after _ ) , exclude it ( _ stop before _ ) , only exclude it if that brings the total mass in stars closer to the cluster mass aimed for than including it ( _ stop nearest _ ) or excluding the last star ( which first surpassed the cluster mass ) at a 50% probability ( _ stop 50/50 _ ) .",
    "2 .   sampling a specific number of stars , estimated from the total cluster mass and average mass in the imf ( with the maximum stellar mass limited to the cluster mass or not ( _ number _ and _ number unlimited _ ) ) .",
    "the ` _ sorted sampling _ ' method of wk06 .",
    "4 .   _ analytic sampling _ , in which we assume that the imf in a cluster is always sampled analytically , excluding stochastic effects .    for more detailed descriptions ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we use a monte carlo approach in order to make the numerical scatter smaller than the difference between igimfs .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the results on the underlying imf ( we test for kroupa ) and the results are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "as the main cause of the lack of high mass stars are the low mass clusters , the behaviour of the cmf at the low mass end is very important .",
    "the default choice is an extrapolation of the observed cmf at higher masses ( @xmath5@xmath1 ) , down to the mass of the smallest observed star forming clumps in the taurus - auriga region .",
    "we therefore test , besides the default choice given above , also a lower limit of 1@xmath1  and 50@xmath1  for the clusters , and power law indices of -1.8 , -3.2 and -4.2 ( effectively changing the number of low mass clusters , compared to high mass clusters ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : igimfs ] we show the resulting igimfs from different sampling methods ( left ) and different cmfs ( right ) . the value of the igimf is divided by the value for the underlying imf , in order to enhance the visibility of the differences . also , dotted lines indicate the slopes the different igimfs would have .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     it can be clearly seen that the different sampling methods give different igimfs .",
    "the recovered cmfs after filling the clusters with stars are indistinguishable from the input cmf .",
    "depending on the method , the steep end has power law indices of about -2.6 , as compared to the input -2.35 .",
    "the ` sorted sampling ' and ` analytic sampling ' get even slightly steeper and deviate strongly from a power law shape .    from the monte carlo realisations using different cmfs , it can be seen that the slope of the cmf determines the high mass end slope of the igimf , whereas the minimum cluster mass sets the stellar mass at which the steepening sets in .",
    "if clusters do not typically go down in mass all the way to the mass range of stars , sampling effects in the igimf will be negligible .",
    "the low mass end of the cmf is badly constrained .",
    "the igimf could be obtained observationally , giving an indirect measure of the low mass end of the cmf ( under the assumption of a sampling method and an underlying imf ) .",
    "using the igimfs as imfs in galaxy evolution models we are able to investigate the integrated properties of galaxies , if their total stellar initial mass distribution is given by an igimf rather than a more standard imf .",
    "the high mass end of the stellar mass distribution is important for galaxies , as their light in many pass bands is dominated by the most massive stars for a wide range of star formation histories , their chemical composition depends on the metals expelled by the massive stars and the ism is strongly influenced by the energy output of the massive stars exploding as supernovae .",
    "as the most pronounced effect appears for the most massive stars , we first estimate the difference in massive star content of the galaxies .",
    "specifically , we estimate the number of o - stars ( with masses @xmath6@xmath1 ) that gaia will be able to observe . assuming that gaia will observe 10% of all o - stars in the galaxy , that they live for 10 myr and that in the past 10 myr the average sfr of the galaxy was 1 @xmath1/yr",
    ", gaia will be able to rule out several of the very extreme igimfs ( from e.g. steep cmfs and sorted sampling ) with very high significance .",
    "judging between the several different sampling methods is difficult , as the differences are of the order of @xmath7 , for purely poissonian errors on the number counts .",
    "if our assumptions regarding the observed fraction of o - stars , the sfr and or the lifetimes of o - stars are inaccurate , the resultant number of o - stars varies linearly with either of them .",
    "the errors on the numbers scale with the square root of the numbers .",
    "as the numbers we calculate are of the order of 1000 to 2000 , and the differences an order of magnitude smaller , the combined effect of our assumptions may be off by a factor of a few and the differences between all igimfs will still be of more than @xmath8 significance .      using the galev evolutionary synthesis models ( @xcite ) we are able to assess observable properties of galaxies , in which the stellar initial mass distribution is given by igimfs , instead of more popular imfs .",
    "the galev models follow the chemical enrichment and photometric evolution of galaxies self - consistently in closed - box models of galaxy evolution .",
    "they are able to match a wide range of observed properties of galaxies of all hubble types , like stellar mass , star formation and multi - band photometry .",
    "the ingredients of the models are star formation histories which depend on the gas mass present ( no in- and outflows are assumed , nor are they necessary ) and hubble type , spectral synthesis , and yield tables .",
    "subsequent generations of stars are formed from the gas enriched by earlier generations .",
    "for all hubble types , the difference in integrated photometry in any band is smaller than the observed galaxy - to - galaxy scatter as present in the hyperleda database ( @xcite )",
    ". therefore , integrated photometry of galaxies will not be a discriminant between imfs and/or igimfs .",
    "many heavy elements are mainly produced in supernova explosions of type ii ( including ib , c ) and in the winds of massive agb stars . with a deficiency in massive stars , as expected from the igimf , less production of metals is to be expected .",
    "the galev models do not follow the chemical enrichment on an element by element basis , but rather follow the total metallicity .",
    "element abundances can then be obtained by assuming solar abundance ratios .    with igimfs",
    "as determined above , metallicities of galaxies vary by half a dex at given gas mass fraction of the galaxies . for the igimfs resulting from extremely steep cmfs , the difference can be up to 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "at given gas mass fractions , the hyperleda database gives a scatter of about half a dex as well .",
    "therefore , the most extreme cmfs can be ruled out by the observed gas phase metallicities . in order to differentiate between several igimfs more precise measurements of metallicities",
    "are necessary .",
    "the difference between sampling methods is comparable to , or slightly larger than the spread that results from using individual metallicity measurements for the same galaxy , and is thus a possible discriminant between igimfs , provided that absolute determinations of gas phase metallicities are reliable ."
