    "understanding physical process of cosmic reionization is one of the major goals in astronomy today . although the increase of gunn - peterson ( gp ) optical depths may be contiguous from low @xmath19 to @xmath20 @xcite , the evolution of gp optical depths clearly show the steep rise at @xmath21 towards high-@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find that the polarization data of wmap place the constraints that instantaneous reionization at the late epoch below @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is rejected at the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) level , and claim that the reionization process would be extended at @xmath26 ( see also @xcite for the latest wmap7 results ) .",
    "however , physical models would not easily reproduce such a long extended reionization due to the rapid recombination of hydrogen ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the combination of subaru and vlt wide - field cameras and the newly - installed hst / wfc3 has identified a definitive decrease of uv - continuum luminosity function ( lf ) from @xmath49 to @xmath50 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , which are also reproduced by recent hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "accordingly the star - formation rates drop roughly by an order of magnitude from its peak of @xmath51 to @xmath52 , and this decrease implies that observations are touching initial formation epoch of galaxies . because galaxies are thought to be sources of reionization , the decrease of uv lf would indicate that galaxies produce less uv ionizing photons towards high redshifts .",
    "the production rate of uv ionizing photons is close to balance with the recombination rate of hydrogen igm at @xmath53 , and the reionizing epoch may be near these redshifts .",
    "the other interpretation of the decrease of uv lf is that a moderately high ionizing photon escape fraction , @xmath54 , is required to keep the universe ionized at @xmath55 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the faintest hst / wfc3 sources at @xmath56 show a very blue uv continuum slope possibly consistent with extremely young , metal - poor stellar populations , which is also suggestive of large escape fraction of @xmath57 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , although there are claims that their uv continuum slope measurements include potentially large statistical and systematic uncertainties @xcite .",

    "these different conclusions of ly@xmath0 lf evolution may be raised by contamination , small statistics and systematic errors such as cosmic variance . moreover , a careful argument is needed for the interpretation of ly@xmath0 lf evolution , because properties of star - formation galaxies are changing , which are already found in the decrease of uv lf of dropout galaxies as discussed above .",
    "it is also important to constrain reionization and galaxy formation models with other observational quantities .",

    "this trend is usually discussed on a plane of uv luminosity and ly@xmath0 ew , and no objects are found in the uv - luminous and ew - large regime ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of our scenario ,",
    "a typical lae evolves into a typical lbg , i.e. less - massive galaxies with a strong ly@xmath0 emission line become massive galaxies with a weak or no ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "when this evolution is investigated on this plane , objects move from uv - faint to uv - luminous regimes , because uv luminosity positively correlates with stellar mass at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the uv - faint ( less - massive ) objects are , first , distributed widely in ew values on this plane before the evolution .",
    "then , these objects end up in the uv - bright and small - ew regime on this plane after the evolution .",
    "the tendency of ly@xmath0 deficit among uv - bright galaxies would be consistent with the scenario of this lae - lbg evolution sequence . in this way",
    ", this evolutionary scenario would provide the answers to these two observational questions .",
    "the recent study of @xcite has found that laes have a more compact uv - continuum morphology than lbgs with no ly@xmath0 emission at @xmath655 .",
    "if our scenario of lae - lbg evolution is correct , star - formation activities start at the center then extend to the outskirts of galaxies , which is suggestive of the inside - out picture of galaxy formation .",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ fig : redshift_bias_lbglae ] show evolutionary tracks of dark halos for galaxy - conserving models .",
    "the galaxy - conserving model assumes that the motion of galaxies is purely driven by gravity , and that merging does not take place . in this case",
    ", the bias value of galaxies decreases as the universe evolves with time , @xmath656 where @xmath657 is a bias at @xmath658 @xcite . under the assumption of the galaxy - conserving evolution ,",
    "dark halos of @xmath654 laes evolve into dark halos with @xmath659 at @xmath658 . because , in more realistic extended press - shechter formalism ( e.g. @xcite ) , average evolutionary tracks come slightly below those of the galaxy - conserving models ( see , e.g. , figure 13 of @xcite )",
    ", dark halos of @xmath654 laes probably evolve into dark halos with @xmath660 which host present - day @xmath661 galaxies including milky way , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in figure [ fig : redshift_bias_lbglae ] , laes at @xmath662 have a significantly larger bias than @xmath654 laes , and the increase of the lae bias measurements toward high-@xmath19 ( nearly along solid lines ) is steeper than those of galaxy - conserving evolution ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the galaxy - conserving model indicates that dark halos of @xmath662 laes evolve into those with @xmath663 at @xmath658 whose value is higher than those of @xmath251 laes ( @xmath659 ) , which implies that descendants of @xmath662 laes are different from those of @xmath654 laes . on average",
    ", the descendants of @xmath662 laes would be more massive than those of @xmath654 laes .",
    "majority of laes at @xmath662 are probably not ancestors of milky way , but today s large galaxies more massive than milky way , although there should exist some laes that become today s @xmath263 galaxies by a probability process of halo mass build up .",
    "these implications from our clustering results are similar to those from theoretical predictions by @xcite who claim that only @xmath537% of milky way progenitors can be laes .",
    "we have identified 207 laes at @xmath1 in the 1 deg@xmath2 area of sxds field down to @xmath98 erg s@xmath6 and @xmath664   by deep and wide - field narrow - band and broad - band imaging of subaru / suprime - cam .",
    "nineteen ly@xmath0 lines are confirmed by the high - quality keck / deimos spectra , and none of interlopers have been found in our sample through our extensive deep spectroscopy campaign as well as the sxds project spectroscopy consisting of 3,233 objects at @xmath204 .",
    "we have obtained the ly@xmath0 lf , acf , and ly@xmath0 line profiles to constrain cosmic reionization and early galaxy formation with the aid of recent theoretical model predictions .",
    "we have also derived acfs of laes at @xmath274 in the sxds field to find the evolutionary trend of lae clustering from @xmath665 in the framework of the @xmath428cdm model .",
    "the major results of our study are summarized below .",
    "our ly@xmath0 lf of @xmath1 laes shows the best - fit schechter parameters of @xmath3mpc@xmath4 and @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 with a fixed @xmath7 , where the errors include uncertainties of statistics and cosmic variance .",
    "the combination of statistics and cosmic variance errors presents scatters of number density measurements up to a factor of @xmath231 among 5 subfields of @xmath233 deg@xmath2 areas , although the typical scatters of the subfield number densities are not far beyond the errors of poisson statistics . comparing this lae lf at @xmath1 with",
    "the one at @xmath8 , we find that the ly@xmath0 lf decreases from @xmath8 to @xmath17 at the @xmath666% confidence level . a more dominant decrease of @xmath263 ( luminosity evolution ) than @xmath259 ( number evolution ) is preferable .",
    "the decrease of ly@xmath0 lf from @xmath8 to @xmath17 is @xmath667% in the case of pure luminosity evolution .",
    "note that this 30%-luminosity decrease is too small to be identified by the previous studies , due to their large uncertainties from small statistics and cosmic variance .",
    "we have identified a significant angular - correlation signal for our @xmath1 lae sample .",
    "this is the detection of clustering signal for the most distant galaxies , to date .",
    "the correlation length and bias are @xmath668 h@xmath12 mpc and bias of @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "there is no sudden boost of clustering amplitude given by cosmic reionization at @xmath1 . in the framework of @xmath428cdm models ,",
    "the average hosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is @xmath14 .",
    "the duty cycle of lae population , a product of star - formation and ly@xmath0 emitting duty cycles , is a few @xmath487 to a few percent , roughly @xmath488% , although the constraint on the duty cycle involves large uncertainties because of the bias estimate errors and the fairly flat relation between number density and bias of halos from the @xmath428cdm model .",
    "\\3 . based on our high quality deimos spectra",
    ", we have found that most of ly@xmath0 emission lines present a clear asymmetric profile with the average fwhm velocity width of @xmath16 km s@xmath6 ( direct measurement ) at @xmath509 , and that the average fwhm velocity width does not largely evolve from @xmath8 to @xmath17 beyond errors of our @xmath519 km s@xmath6 , which is dominated by the error of our reference @xmath8 lae .",
    "there is no anti - correlation between ly@xmath0 luminosity and velocity width .",
    "if our spectroscopic sample is not biased , ly@xmath0 velocity width positively correlates with ly@xmath0 luminosity at @xmath1 in the luminosity range of @xmath509 .",
    "we identify a knee feature in a blue tail of ly@xmath0 line in our composite spectra of laes at @xmath1 as well as @xmath252 , which can not be explained by statistical and systematic instrumental errors .",
    "these knee features , if true , would be important for understanding dynamics , uv radiation field , and structure of laes .    \\4 .",
    "we compare evolution of ly@xmath0 lf , clustering , and ly@xmath0 line profiles from our observations with various reionization models including analytic , semi - analytic , and radiative transfer models .",
    "although there would exist a small @xmath669%-decrease of igm transmission from @xmath8 to @xmath17 due to cosmic reionization , the comparisons of all models and observational quantities reach the same conclusion that hydrogen igm is not highly neutral at @xmath1 .",
    "the upper limit of neutral fraction is @xmath637 from our ly@xmath0 lf evolution and @xmath617 from our clustering evolution between @xmath8 and @xmath17 .",
    "a fully neutral universe , @xmath630 , at @xmath1 is ruled out by no large evolution of ly@xmath0 velocity width from @xmath8 to @xmath17 and by no anti - correlation between ly@xmath0 luminosity and velocity width at @xmath1 .",
    "all of these reionization tests with ly@xmath0 lfs , clustering , and line profiles , agree that a neutral hydrogen fraction of igm is not high at @xmath1 .",
    "our strongest constraint from ly@xmath0 lf , @xmath637 , implies that the major reionization process took place early , at @xmath642 .",
    "\\5 . calculating acfs , bias , and hosting dark halos of low-@xmath19 laes of sxds at @xmath274 in the same manner as those of our @xmath1 laes",
    ", we find that hosting dark halo masses stay at the similar value of @xmath614 over @xmath670 .",
    "it implies that laes are galaxies at the evolutionary stage for all or some type of galaxies whose dark halos have reached a mass of @xmath478 .",
    "because a halo mass of typical ( @xmath671 ) lbgs is @xmath650 , about one order of magnitude larger than that of laes , there is a possibility that some galaxies become laes with a halo mass of @xmath652 in the @xmath488% duty cycle , then evolve into typical lbgs with a halo mass of @xmath653 via mass assembly such as mergers and accretion .",
    "this scenario consistently explains two observational results of lbgs and laes ; the different lf evolutionary trend between lbgs and laes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the deficit of strong ly@xmath0 emitters among uv bright population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present ly@xmath0 luminosity function ( lf ) , clustering measurements , and ly@xmath0 line profiles based on the largest sample , to date , of 207 ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) at @xmath1 on the 1-deg@xmath2 sky of subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) field . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath1 ly@xmath0 lf including cosmic variance estimates yields the best - fit schechter parameters of @xmath3mpc@xmath4 and @xmath5erg s@xmath6 with a fixed @xmath7 , and indicates a decrease from @xmath8 at the @xmath9% confidence level . however , this decrease is not large , only @xmath10% in ly@xmath0 luminosity , which is too small to be identified in the previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> a clustering signal of @xmath1 laes is detected for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the correlation length of @xmath11 h@xmath12 mpc and bias of @xmath13 , and find no significant boost of clustering amplitude by reionization at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the average hosting dark halo mass inferred from clustering is @xmath14 , and duty cycle of lae population is roughly @xmath15% albeit with large uncertainties . the average of our high - quality keck / deimos spectra shows an fwhm velocity width of @xmath16 km s@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no large evolution of ly@xmath0 line profile from @xmath8 to @xmath17 , and no anti - correlation between ly@xmath0 luminosity and line width at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of various reionization models and our observational results about the lf , clustering , and line profile indicates that there would exist a small decrease of igm s ly@xmath0 transmission owing to reionization , but that the hydrogen igm is not highly neutral at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our neutral - hydrogen fraction constraint implies that the major reionization process took place at @xmath18 . </S>"
