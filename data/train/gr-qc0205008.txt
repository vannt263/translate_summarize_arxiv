    "binary black holes are considered as one of the most promising sources for the gravitational wave interferometric detectors ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama currently under construction , as well as for the space interferometer lisa in project . from the theoretical point of view , computing the final inspiral and merger of binary black holes has proved to be a very difficult task . however , when the black holes are far enough so that the radiation reaction timescale is large as compared to the dynamical timescale , the orbits can be approximated as closed ones . moreover , due to the accumulated effects of the reaction to gravitational radiation , these orbits can be considered as circular .",
    "in such a case ( closed circular orbits ) , the spacetime possesses a one - parameter symmetry group , whose integral curves are helices .",
    "the associated killing vector is called the _ helical killing vector_. in full general relativity , requiring the helical symmetry for a binary system imply equal amounts of outgoing and incoming gravitational radiation.@xcite the spacetime can not therefore not be asymptotically flat.@xcite however , there are two interesting cases where helical symmetry and asymptotic flatness are compatible : ( i ) in the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation , up to the second order and ( ii ) the isenberg - wilson - mathews ( iwm ) approximation of general relativity ( see e.g. sec .",
    "iv.c of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which assumes that the spacetime can be foliated by a family of conformally flat spacelike hypersurfaces and reduces the einstein equations to five elliptic equations .",
    "both approximations ( i ) and ( ii ) do not allow for gravitational radiation , which explains why they permit asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "they are valid approximations to general relativity when the gravitational radiation content of spacetime does not play any important dynamical role .",
    "note that the iwm formulation contains the first order pn one .    in our first study of the binary black hole problem,@xcite",
    "we have used the helical symmetry along with the iwm approximation      regarding the rotation state of the black holes , we have chosen each black hole to be corotating ( synchronized binary ) , so that the whole system is in rigid rotation .",
    "there are several motivations for this : ( i ) it has been recently argued@xcite that when the black holes are close together , tidal forces may lead to an efficient transfer of spin angular momentum to orbital angular , which might lead to synchronization .",
    "however this not clear yet .",
    "( ii ) as discussed by friedman et al.@xcite , corotating black holes are the only state compatible with the helical symmetry in full general relativity ( basically , any other rotation state would result in shear and increase of the horizon area , which is not allowed by the helical symmetry ) .",
    "detweiler@xcite has already pointed this by noticing that gravitational radiation going down in the hole from the distant past piles up near the distant horizon , resulting in a divergence of the metric , except for the corotating state .",
    "( iii ) for the iwm spacetimes we are considering , other rotation states are permitted,@xcite but the corotating one has a very simple geometrical interpretation : the black holes horizons are in this case killing horizons , i.e. the helical killing vector is tangent to the black hole horizons.@xcite      in the iwm framework , the field equations reduce to five elliptic equations and the orbital angular velocity @xmath0 appears only in the boundary condition at infinity for the corotating shift vector .",
    "this contrasts with the fluid case , where @xmath0 shows up in the equation governing the equilibrium of the fluid .",
    "we have determined @xmath0 by demanding that the adm mass be equal to the komar - like one@xcite , a requirement which reduces to the classical virial theorem at the newtonian limit .",
    "we have verified that when the holes are far apart , this procedure leads to kepler s third law .    the minimum of adm mass along a sequence of decreasing circular orbits with constant horizon area marks the limit of orbital stability.@xcite we call this configuration the isco ( for _ innermost stable circular orbit _ ) .",
    "the five non - linear elliptic equations describing corotating binary black holes in the iwm approximation have been solved by means of a multi - domain spectral method.@xcite we use spherical coordinate systems centered on each black hole , which allow for an easy implementation of the boundary conditions on the horizons .",
    "moreover the computational domain extends to spacelike infinity , thanks to some suitable compactification of the external domain .",
    "this permits a rigorous implementation of the boundary condition at infinity ( flat spacetime ) .",
    "the numerical implementation has been performed by means of an object - oriented code based on the lorene library.@xcite numerous tests of the code have been presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "prior to our study@xcite , the agreement between numerical computations of orbiting black holes and analytical ( post - newtonian ) ones was very bad ( compare the dotted line with the dot - dashed one in fig .  [",
    "f : comp]a ) .",
    "notably the orbital frequency at the isco was differing by a factor of two ( compare the triangles with the circles and diamonds in fig .  [",
    "f : comp]b ) .",
    "our results , based on the helical killing vector approach , turned out to be much closer to the post - newtonian ones ( compare the dark solid line with the light solid one in fig .  [",
    "f : comp]a , as well as the square with the circles and diamonds in fig .",
    "[ f : comp]b ) .",
    "we present a detailed comparison with the effective one body ( eob ) analytical approach in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this work has benefited from numerous discussions with luc blanchet , brandon carter , thibault damour , david hobill , jrme novak and keisuke taniguchi .",
    "we warmly thank all of them ."
