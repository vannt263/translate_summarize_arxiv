    "the @xmath0 mass region is a particularly complex one , displaying transitional behavior such as prolate - oblate deformed shapes , @xmath5-unstability , triaxial deformation and/or coexistence of different configurations which present a daunting challenge to nuclear structure models . despite this complexity",
    ", the @xmath0 mass region has been a rich source of empirical evidence for the existence of dynamical symmetries in nuclei both for even - even , odd - proton , odd - neutron and odd - odd nuclei , as well as supersymmetric pairs @xcite and quartets of nuclei @xcite .    in this contribution , we present evidence for the existence of a new supersymmetric quartet in the @xmath0 mass region , consisting of the @xmath2os and @xmath3ir nuclei , and study correlations between different one- and two - nucleon transfer reactions .",
    "dynamical supersymmetries ( susy ) were introduced in nuclear physics in the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) and its extensions @xcite .",
    "the ibm describes collective excitations in even - even nuclei in terms of a system of interacting monopole ( @xmath6 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath7 ) bosons @xcite .",
    "the bosons are associated with the number of correlated proton and neutron pairs , and hence the number of bosons @xmath8 is half the number of valence nucleons . for odd - mass nuclei",
    "the ibm was extended to include single - particle degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the ensuing interacting boson - fermion model ( ibfm ) has as its building blocks @xmath8 bosons with @xmath9 and @xmath10 fermion ( @xmath11 ) with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the ibm and ibfm can be unified into a supersymmetry ( susy ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dimension of the fermion space @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "even - even and odd - even nuclei form the members of a supermultiplet which is characterized by @xmath15 , i.e. , the total number of bosons and fermions .",
    "supersymmetry distinguishes itself from other symmetries in that it includes , in addition to transformations among fermions and among bosons , also transformations that change a boson into a fermion and _ vice versa_.    the concept of nuclear susy was extended in 1985 to include the neutron - proton degree of freedom @xcite . in this case , a supermultiplet consists of an even - even , an odd - proton , an odd - neutron and an odd - odd nucleus .",
    "the the best experimental evidence of a supersymmetric quartet is provided by the @xmath16pt and @xmath17au nuclei as an example of the @xmath18 supersymmetry @xcite , in which the odd neutron is allowed to occupy the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbits of the 82 - 126 shell , and the odd proton the @xmath22 orbit of the 50 - 82 shell .",
    "this supermultiplet is characterized by @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "recently , the structure of the odd - odd nucleus @xmath1ir was investigated by a series of transfer and neutron capture reactions @xcite . in particular , the new data from the polarized @xmath32 transfer reaction provided crucial new information about and insight into the structure of the spectrum of @xmath1ir which led to significant changes in the assignment of levels as compared to previous work @xcite .",
    "the odd - odd nucleus @xmath1ir differs from @xmath33au by two protons , the number of neutrons being the same .",
    "the latter is crucial , since the dominant interaction between the odd neutron and the core nucleus is of quadrupole type , which arises from a more general interaction in the ibfm for very special values of the occupation probabilities of the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbits , _",
    "i.e. _ to the location of the fermi surface for the neutron orbits @xcite .",
    "this situation is satisfied to a good approximation by the @xmath34pt and @xmath33au nuclei , and thus also for @xmath4os and @xmath1ir .",
    "for this reason , it is reasonable to expect the odd - odd nucleus @xmath1ir to provide another example of the @xmath35 supersymmetry .",
    "[ ir194 ] shows the negative parity levels of @xmath1ir in comparison with the theoretical spectrum in which it is assumed that these levels originate from the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 configuration .",

    "ir.,width=302 ]    the successful description of the odd - odd nucleus @xmath1ir opens the possibility of identifying a second quartet of nuclei in the @xmath0 mass region with @xmath35 supersymmetry .",
    "the new quartet consists of the nuclei @xmath2os and @xmath3ir and is characterized by @xmath23 and @xmath45 .",

    "the nuclei belonging to a supersymmetric quartet are described by a single hamiltonian , and hence the wave functions , transition and transfer rates are strongly correlated . as an example of these correlations , we consider here",

    "@xmath62 relative to that of the ground state band @xmath63 $ ] , @xmath64 is given by @xcite @xmath65 which gives @xmath66 for @xmath1pt @xmath53 @xmath34pt ( @xmath67 ) , in comparison with the experimental value of 19.0 for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for @xmath46os @xmath53 @xmath4os ( @xmath70 ) . the equivalent ratio for the inverse pick - up reaction is given by @xmath71 which gives @xmath72 for @xmath34pt @xmath53 @xmath1pt ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 for @xmath4os @xmath53 @xmath46os ( @xmath76 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "this means that the mixed symmetry @xmath59 state is predicted to be excited more strongly than the first excited @xmath59 state .",
    "this correlation between pick - up and stripping reactions can be derived in a general way only using the symmetry relations that exist between the wave functions of the even - even and odd - neutron nuclei of the supersymmetric quartet .",
    "it is important to point out , that eqs .",
    "( [ ratio ] and ( [ corr ] ) are parameter - independent predictions which are a direct consequence of nuclear susy and which can be tested experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented evidence for the existence of a second quartet of nuclei in the @xmath77 region with @xmath78 supersymmetry , consisting of the @xmath2os and @xmath3ir nuclei .",
    "the analysis is based on new experimental information on @xmath1ir . in particular , the @xmath32 reaction is important to establish the spin and parity assignments of the energy levels , and to provide insight into the structure of the spectrum of @xmath1ir . given the complexity of the @xmath0 mass region , the simple yet detailed description of @xmath1ir in a supersymmetry scheme is truly remarkable .",
    "nuclear supersymmetry establishes precise links among the spectroscopic properties of different nuclei .",
    "this relation has been used to predict the energies of @xmath4os .",
    "since the wave functions of the members of a supermultiplet are connected by symmetry , there exists a high degree of correlation between different one- and two - nucleon transfer reactions not only between nuclei belonging to the same quartet , but also for nuclei from different multiplets @xcite . as an example",
    ", we studied the correlations between one - neutron transfer reactions for the pt and os isotopes , and predicted that the @xmath59 mixed symmetry states in the even - even nucleus are populated much stronger than the first excited @xmath59 state .    in order to establish the existence of a second supersymmetric quartet of nuclei in the @xmath0 mass region , it is crucial that the nucleus @xmath4os be studied in more detail experimentally .",
