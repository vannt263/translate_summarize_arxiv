    "cluster algebras were introduced by fomin and zelevinsky in 2002 in @xcite in order to give an algebraic framework for the study of the ( dual ) canonical bases in lie theory .",
    "this work was further developed in @xcite .",
    "cluster algebras are commutative algebras given by generators , the _ cluster variables _ , and relations .",
    "the construction of the generators is a recursive process from an initial set of data . in general , even in small cases , this is a complex process .",
    "however , there is a class of cluster algebras coming from surfaces @xcite where this process is encoded in the combinatorial geometry of surface triangulations .",
    "surface cluster algebras are an important part of the classification of ( skew - symmetric ) cluster algebras in terms of mutation type , namely almost all cluster algebras of finite mutation type are surface cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "cluster algebras from surfaces have been widely studied via the combinatorial geometry of the corresponding surfaces @xcite .",
    "the same holds true for the associated cluster categories and jacobian algebras .",
    "an important example of this is the crossing of two arcs in a surface . in the case of cluster algebras",
    "this gives rise to a multiplication formula for the corresponding cluster variables @xcite . in the cluster category",
    ", the number of crossings of two arcs gives the dimension of the extension space between the associated indecomposable objects @xcite .",
    "for jacobian algebras of surfaces where all marked points lie in the boundary , in @xcite , building on @xcite and @xcite , auslander - reiten sequences have been given in terms of arcs in the surface .",
    "in general , however , there has so far been no link between arbitrary crossings of arcs in the surface and the extensions between indecomposable modules in the jacobian algebra .",
    "the jacobian algebras under consideration are gentle algebras and their indecomposable modules , given by strings and bands , correspond to curves and closed curves in the surface @xcite ( see @xcite for a more general definition of jacobian algebras via quiver with potential ) .",
    "gentle algebras form a special class of algebras , for example , this class is closed under tilting and derived equivalence @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are part of the larger family of string algebras which are an important family of algebras of tame representation type whose representation theory is well - understood .",
    "for example , their auslander - reiten structure has been determined @xcite and in @xcite the morphisms between indecomposable modules are completely described . however , a complete description of the extensions between indecomposable modules is not known .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a full description of the extension space of string modules over gentle jacobian algebras .",
    "furthermore , we show that in analogy with the cluster category , the number of crossings of two arcs still gives rise to a dimension formula of the extension space between the corresponding indecomposable modules in the jacobian algebra by explicitly constructing a basis",
    ". however , not every crossing contributes to this dimension .",
    "we characterize exactly which crossings contribute and which do not .",
    "we do this by introducing a new approach , consisting of using the snake graph calculus developed in @xcite to explicitly construct extensions resulting from crossing arcs .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the dimensions of the extensions spaces in the jacobian algebra . in order to obtain an upper bound , we work in the cluster category .",
    "there we show explicitly how the four arcs in the surface , resulting from the smoothing of a crossing of two not necessarily distinct arcs , give rise to two extensions in the cluster category .    for a surface cluster algebra ,",
    "the cluster variables are in bijection with arcs in the surface @xcite . moreover , in a given triangulation , each arc corresponds to a combinatorial object called _ snake graph _ @xcite .",
    "snake graphs have proven to be an important element in the understanding of surface cluster algebras , for example , in @xcite snake graphs ( and band graphs ) were used to show that certain collections of loops and ( generalised ) arcs comprise vector space bases for surface cluster algebras .",
    "snake graphs have also been instrumental in the proof of the positivity conjecture for surface cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "note that the conjecture has since been proved for all skew - symmetric cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "if two ( generalised ) arcs @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a marked surface @xmath2 cross then the geometric operation of smoothing the crossing is given by locally replacing the crossing @xmath3 with the pair of segments @xmath4 or with the pair of segments @xmath5 .",
    "this gives rise to four new arcs @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to the two different ways of smoothing the crossing .",
    "the corresponding elements @xmath8 in the cluster algebra satisfy the so - called _ skein relations _",
    "given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are some coefficients @xcite .",
    "suppose from now on that @xmath2 is a marked surface such that all marked points are in the boundary of @xmath11 and let @xmath12 be a triangulation of @xmath2 .",
    "all arcs are considered to be generalised , that is they might have self - crossings .",
    "the abstract snake graph calculus developed in @xcite applies in this setting and gives a combinatorial interpretation in terms of snake graphs of the arcs resulting from the smoothing of two crossing arcs .",
    "we remark that we never actually smooth self - crossings as in @xcite , but instead in the case of a self - crossing we consider two copies of the same arc .",
    "we then use the combinatorial description in @xcite to study the extension space over the associated jacobian algebra @xmath13 and over the cluster category @xmath14 defined in @xcite by giving explicit bases for these spaces .",
    "as mentioned above , the string modules over @xmath13 are in bijection with the arcs in the surface @xcite not contained in @xmath12 , and the arcs in the surface correspond in turn to snake graphs @xcite .",
    "therefore there is a correspondence associating a snake graph corresponding to an arc in @xmath15 to the string module corresponding to the same arc and this defines a sign function on the snake graph , see proposition  [ snakestrings ] .",
    "based on the snake graph calculus developed in @xcite , given two string modules , we define three types of crossings of modules corresponding to the three different types of crossings of the associated snake graphs .",
    "namely , if the snake graphs cross with an overlap then we say that the corresponding string modules _ cross in a module_. if the snake graphs cross with grafting and @xmath16 then we say that the corresponding string modules _ cross in an arrow _ and finally if the snake graphs cross with grafting and @xmath17 then the corresponding string modules _ cross in a 3-cycle_. our first result is then to determine when two crossing string modules @xmath18 and @xmath19 give rise to a non - zero element in @xmath20 .",
    "* theorem 3.5*[shortexactsequencesintro ]    note that there is a direction in the crossing of modules , that is `",
    "@xmath18 crosses @xmath19 ' is different from ` @xmath19 crosses @xmath18 ' and that this distinction does not appear in terms of crossings of the corresponding arcs , see section  [ crossingmodulessection ] for more details .",
    "we remark that theorem 3.5 can be interpreted as skein relations for string modules and such skein relations have been announced in @xcite in the setting of caldero - chapoton algebras .    in the cluster category @xmath21 the indecomposable objects",
    "correspond to arcs and ( non - contractible ) loops in @xmath2 and therefore they are referred to as string and band objects , respectively , see @xcite .",
    "it follows from the results on ar - triangles in @xcite that all triangles between indecomposable objects in @xmath14 have at most two middle terms . for triangles corresponding to extensions between string objects",
    ", we explicitly describe these middle terms in terms of string objects .",
    "we remark that an important factor in the proof is the geometric interpretation of iyama - yoshino reduction @xcite given by marsh - palu @xcite .",
    "* theorem 4.1 * [ trianglesintro ] _ let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be two string objects ( not necessarily distinct ) in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath22 be the string objects corresponding to the smoothing of a crossing of the arcs associated to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "then there are two non - split triangles in @xmath14 given by @xmath23\\ ] ] and @xmath24.\\ ] ] _    if any of the arcs corresponding to @xmath22 are boundary arcs in @xmath2 then the corresponding objects in @xmath25 are zero .",
    "in @xcite the dimension of the extension space of two string objects in the cluster category is shown to be equal to the number of crossings of the corresponding arcs .",
    "therefore , keeping the notation of theorem 4.1 , leads to the following remark .    * remark * _ considering all the crossings of the arcs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the triangles in theorem 4.1 give bases of the spaces @xmath26 and @xmath27 and these bases consist of triangles in string objects . _",
    "theorem  3.5 together with theorem  4.1 and the dimension formula in @xcite , give the following result for extensions in the jacobian algebra . here",
    "@xmath28 is the minimal number of intersections of two arcs @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that we use the following convention : if @xmath31 then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the minimal number of self - crossings of @xmath29 .",
    "* corollary 4.2 *    * acknowledgments : * the authors would like to thank ralf schiffler for helpful conversations .",
