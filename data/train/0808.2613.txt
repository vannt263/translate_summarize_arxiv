    "it is well known that in 3 dimensions gravity is described by a topological field theory , and therefore has a finite number of topological degrees of freedom reflecting the topology of spacetime @xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 gravity is coupled to point particles , which can be modeled as charged punctures of space manifold , these topological degrees of freedom can be `` integrated out '' leading to effective , deformed particle kinematics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this effective system of deformed particles is of doubly special relativity type ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the original proposal and @xcite , @xcite for reviews ) , being characterized by two scales , velocity of light @xmath3 and planck mass @xmath4 . similarly it turns out that integrating out topological gravitational degrees of freedom in the case of gravity coupled to fields leads to effective field theory on non - commutative spacetime @xcite , @xcite . as a result",
    "spacetime symmetries of deformed systems become quantum symmetries , being described by quantum groups , instead of the standard lie groups .",
    "the question arises if something similar could happen in the case of physical , 4-dimensional gravity coupled to particles and/or fields ? certainly , in @xmath5 gravity possesses local degrees of freedom exhibited by newtonian interactions and gravitational waves , for example .",
    "however , as stressed in the context of recent investigations in quantum gravity phenomenology ( see @xcite for recent review and references to earlier works ) our best hope to see signals of quantum gravity is to look for high - energetic events events ( like scattering of ultra high energy cosmic rays ) in description of whose local degrees of freedom of gravity play no role . if we expect to see some quantum gravity imprints there , to describe them we must look for `` no local gravity limit of gravity '' , hoping that in this limit the effective theory behaves like gravity in @xmath2 , effectively deforming particles and fields kinematics .",
    "this is why we make use of dsr - like test theories , that predict deformation of spacetime - symmetries characterized by planck - scale deformation parameter to describe quantum gravity signal that may be detected in foreseeable experiments .",
    "it is therefore of interest to look for a formulation of gravity such that one keeps good control over the limit , in which local gravitational degrees of freedom are not present . in this limit gravity",
    "is described locally by its maximally symmetric vacuum state : minkowski space for zero cosmological constant , and ( anti ) de sitter space in the case of the ( negative ) positive one .",
    "coupling such a theory to point particles and then taking the limit makes it possible investigate the effective behavior of the particles .",
    "one then can ask the question if the quantum gravity scale is still present in this effective theory , acting as a deformation ?",
    "naively the answer would be in the negative , and after taking a limit we would end up with the standard theory of particles moving on minkowski space of special relativity ( or on ( anti ) de sitter space when the cosmological constant is non - zero . ) on the other hand , the experience of 3d gravity suggests that even in the limit the effective theory might be deformed by the presence of planck scale .",
    "this is the problem that we would like to investigate in this paper .    as said above , in 4 dimensions gravity",
    "is certainly not a topological theory .",
    "however , it can be nevertheless described by a bf topological theory with de sitter @xmath0 gauge group , appended by a small term that breaks gauge symmetry down to lorentz @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of this symmetry breaking term switches on the local degrees of freedom of gravity , while in the limit , in which this term vanishes the theory becomes topological , as in @xmath2 . such formulation of gravitational field has its roots in the proposal of macdowell and mansouri @xcite and has been recently investigated in depth in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the construction presented in these works is as follows .",
    "the building blocks are the @xmath0 connection @xmath6 with curvature @xmath7 and the @xmath8 valued two - form field @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , in terms of whose the action takes the form @xmath11 in this action a constant algebra element @xmath12 enforces breaking the gauge symmetry group down to @xmath1 ( the subgroup of @xmath0 that leaves @xmath12 invariant . ) without loss of generality we can take this vector to be @xmath13 so that the action takes the form @xmath14 the first two terms in the action describe the topological field theory , and in the limit @xmath15 the only solution of equations of motion is de sitter space , the topological vacuum of the full theory .",
    "notice that both the topological lagrangian and the gauge breaking one are manifestly diffeomorphism invariant , and thus the perturbation theory in @xmath16 , around topological vacuum , corresponding to topological theory at @xmath17 , is going to be manifestly diffeomorphism invariant as well .    remarkably , it can be shown @xcite that if one decomposes the connection @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being a constant of dimension of length , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are tetrad and lorentz connection one forms , respectively , after solving for @xmath24 this action reproduces , up to topological terms , to the standard einstein ",
    "cartan one @xmath25 the last term in this action does not modify field equations if torsion vanishes .",
    "the physical constants : newton s constant @xmath26 , cosmological constant @xmath27 and immirzi parameter @xmath28 are related to the dimensional parameters of the original action ( [ 0.2 ] ) and the scale @xmath19 as follows @xmath29    one can couple gravity described by the action ( [ 0.2 ] ) to particles in a rather straightforward way @xcite ( see also @xcite for recent discussion . )",
    "each particle with ( dimensionless ) mass @xmath30 and spin @xmath31 at rest is described by an appropriate element of the @xmath8 algebra . here",
    "we describe it by a canonically conjugated element of the algebra . ]",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are `` translational '' `` rotational '' generators of @xmath8 algebra , respectively .",
    "then the lagrangian describing the particle at rest is simply @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the particle worldline , and @xmath37 is the affine parameter .",
    "the action ( [ 0.6 ] ) breaks gauge invariance at the particle worldline .",
    "however @xmath0 gauge transformations are just translations and lorentz transformations , so acting by gauge transformations on the particle at rest just makes the particle moving . in this way",
    "the gauge degrees of freedom of gravity on worldline become dynamical degrees of freedom of the particle and the action describing arbitrarily moving particle has the form @xmath38 it can be shown @xcite that this action leads to correct equations of motion for the particle and generalized einstein equations with mass and spin of the particle being the source of curvature and torsion , respectively .",
    "notice that the action ( [ 0.7 ] ) easily generalizes to the case of a finite number of particles in which case it reads @xmath39 for further discussion of this formulation of gravity coupled to particles see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the action of gravity ( [ 0.2 ] ) coupled to particles ( [ 0.8 ] ) is a convenient starting point to address the question raised above .",
    "the point is that the presence of the parameter @xmath16 in the action ( [ 0.2 ] ) makes the `` no gravity limit '' easy to control , and to set up a perturbative theory . in the next section we consider the quantum perturbative expansion in parameter @xmath16",
    "and we argue that the zeroth order of this expansion is described by a holographic theory living on the boundary of spacetime .",
    "then , in the following two sections , we will show how such boundary theory reduces to effective particles dynamics . in the final section we discuss the obtained results .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the zeroth order approximation of perturbation theory of quantum gravity with particles around bf topological quantum field theory is described by chern - simons theory coupled to point sources .",
    "we will not study higher order corrections here .    for shortness",
    "let us write the action ( [ 0.2 ] ) as @xmath40 where now @xmath41 is a lagrangian of topological field theory possibly coupled to particles , and @xmath42 is a symmetry breaking interaction term .",
    "the general perturbative expression for the partition function coupled to arbitrary finite number of particles ( where we neglect all the interactions except gravitational ) looks like @xmath43 \\nonumber \\\\ = \\sum\\limits_n \\frac{(i\\alpha)^n}{n!}z_n(\\{g_{p_i}\\},\\{g_{p_f}\\}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 group elements labeling initial and final positions and orientations of @xmath47-th particle with respect to the selected reference point .",
    "they can be obtained as holonomies of connection @xmath48 between corresponding points ( see @xcite for detailed discussion . )    the expression ( [ series1 ] ) is formal , of course , and we have to define it precisely .",
    "first we must specify the measure @xmath49 in the path integral .",
    "since the action describes a system with gauge symmetry the conventional way to proceed would be to introduce a gauge - fixing term .",
    "an immediate problem with this approach has been pointed out in @xcite for yang - mills theory .",
    "namely , since the interaction term breaks the symmetry , higher order terms in perturbative expansion have less gauge symmetry than the free action . on the other hand , if we do not fix all the gauge symmetries of the free action we can not construct a propagator because of non - invertibility of the quadratic form .",
    "the approach of @xcite has been to introduce an auxiliary field that turns gauge degrees of freedom into physical ones already at zero order .",
    "such procedure however trivially reduces the perturbative expansion to the standard one around fixed background .",
    "this is appropriate in the case of yang - mills theory , but can not be applied in the case of a theory that is supposed to be background independent .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different approach which does not use a gauge fixing . to define a path integral without gauge",
    "fixing one has to explicitly construct the reduced phase space spanned by the complete set of gauge invariant observables and define a measure on it . in most situations",
    "the later is not possible for technical reasons , e.g. it is certainly impossible to construct all the diffeomorphism invariant observables of four dimensional general relativity .",
    "fortunately , this turns out to be possible for any finite order terms of the perturbation theory considered here .",
    "this happens because the starting point for the expansion is a topological field theory whose reduced phase space ( moduli space ) is finite dimensional . then , in finite order of perturbative expansion the dimensionality of the moduli space is getting larger , but remains finite . therefore , in any finite order of expansion the moduli space can be , explicitly constructed and the measure on it can be defined .    to show this",
    "let us replace the integral over the symmetry breaking lagrangian in ( [ series1 ] ) by its riemann definition .",
    "divide the manifold @xmath50 into @xmath51 cells @xmath52 where each cell is sufficiently small so that every field @xmath53 on which the lagrangian depends can be considered constant within each cell @xmath54",
    "the integral is a sum of contributions from every cell @xmath55 where @xmath56 here we took into account that the lagrangian @xmath57 is a density and the volume element is already contained in it .",
    "consider the contribution of a cell @xmath52 to the partition function at the first order @xmath58 and compare it with the contribution @xmath59 from another cell @xmath60 .",
    "one can always find a diffeomorphism @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "the fields also transform under this diffeomorphism @xmath63 . due to diffeomorpfism invariance of the interaction term @xmath64",
    "the free action is also diffeomorphism invariant and we assume that we can define a diffeomorphism invariant measure of the path integral @xmath65 as a result , the contribution to the path integral from different cells is equal , @xmath66 , and the sum over cells becomes trivial .    at higher order one has to distinguish the situations when the cells on which the interaction term is applied are the same or distinct .",
    "@xmath67    in the limit of large number of cells the first term , where interaction is applied to the distinct cells , will be dominating .",
    "the above argument is analogous to that of coordinates - independence of @xmath68-point functions of diffeomorphism invariant theories ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "so far we were using only diffeomorphism invariance of the free action .",
    "its topological invariance allows us to give a complete definition of every term in the expansion of the the path integral .",
    "the free action can be replaced by its discretized version @xmath69 , and the measure can be specified as @xmath70 .",
    "the resulting path integral is finite dimensional and due to topological invariance of the free action is independent of the discretization .",
    "let us now specify the model in ( [ modelgeneral ] ) to be ( [ 0.2 ] ) with particles coupling in the @xmath15 limit , i.e.  being defined , after integrating out b - field , by @xmath71 in the formula above @xmath72 is an algebra element defining mass and spin of @xmath73-th particle ( both @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the physical mass and @xmath19 is the length scale of the model ( [ 0.4 ] ) , and @xmath76 are dimensionless here ) , @xmath77 is a timelike particle trajectory which can be taken arbitrary due to topological invariance of the model . in the present paper",
    "we are studying only the zeroth order contribution , and therefore we do not consider the interaction term @xmath78 here .    due to bianchi identity",
    "the integral of the first term in ( [ lbf ] ) after integration by parts reduces to a chern - simons action on the boundary of the original manifold @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 below we consider the boundary @xmath81 to be the direct product of a ( punctured ) sphere @xmath82 with the real line @xmath83 .",
    "the second term in ( [ lbf ] ) breaks the gauge symmetry at the location of the particles thus promoting some of the gauge degrees of freedom to the physical ones .",
    "we can include the latter explicitly by substituting into the action the connection in an explicit gauge transformed form : @xmath84 at the location of the particles @xmath85 become physical degrees of freedom .",
    "to make a link with canonical formulation we will rewrite the resulting action explicitly , decomposing the connection into .spacelike and timelike components .",

    "the one - dimensional delta function @xmath96 reducing the expression to the boundary is defined by @xmath97    in the action ( [ 2.2a ] ) the first line is the kinetic term , while the second is the constraint @xmath98    notice that because of topological invariance of the model the deformation of the trajectory of a particle @xmath99 does not change the value of the physical degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "the later are encoded in the group elements @xmath100 at the location of the particle and not in the position of the trajectory .",
    "in particular , by such deformation one can map the whole particle trajectory @xmath101 on the boundary @xmath102 of the manifold without changing @xmath100 .",
    "however , the constraint ( [ 2.4a ] ) distinguishes the boundary , and in fact , mapping the particle trajectories to the boundary is the only way to satisfy it for a nonzero value of @xmath92 . indeed ,",
    "if some part of the particle trajectory does not belong to the boundary , at such points the first term in ( [ 2.4a ] ) is zero , while the second term is equal to a constant times @xmath92 .",
    "in such situation the constraint ( [ 2.4a ] ) would force @xmath92 to be zero . as due to bianchi",
    "identity the charge @xmath92 has to be conserved , @xmath103 along some part of trajectory means @xmath103 along the whole trajectory which in turn means that there is no particle .",
    "thus , the only way to introduce a particle satisfying constraint ( [ 2.4a ] ) is to map the whole particle trajectory on the boundary .",
    "mapping particle trajectories on the boundary is analogous to introducing the dirac string singularity for magnetic monopole in electromagnetism . through the dirac string",
    "the magnetic flux can reach from the boundary to the point at which the monopole is located . in our model",
    "the situation is even simpler . in topological field theory",
    "the position of a monopole with respect to a manifold coordinates has no physical relevance . therefore connecting a monopole to the boundary with a string",
    "is the same as placing the monopole on the boundary .",
    "we have seen that the equations of motion of the model , namely the constraint ( [ 2.4a ] ) , force the particle trajectories to lie on the boundary @xmath102 of the manifold .",
    "so far our considerations were classical .",
    "but we should expect these results to hold also in quantum theory because the equations of motion which are constraints on initial data , such as ( [ 2.4a ] ) hold in quantum theory exactly . to see this",
    "let us substitute the action ( [ 2.1a ] ) into the path integral over the connection @xmath48 and perform integration over @xmath104 . among the spatial components of connection @xmath48 we will distinguish @xmath105  the components lying within the boundary and @xmath106  the component transverse to the boundary .",

    "the correspondence is precise .",
    "this picture is also supported by spinfoam studies @xcite where it was shown that the invariants of four dimensional crane - yetter model are equivalent to turaev - viro invariants on the three dimensional boundary .",
    "let us summarize what was achieved above .",
    "we showed that in the topological limit the action for gravity coupled to the particles is equivalent to the chern - simon action for the gauge group @xmath0 , coupled to particles , carrying the charges ( masses and spins ) of the same group .",
    "the 3 dimensional manifold on which this theory is defined is assumed to be a product of a punctured 2-sphere @xmath82 , with each puncture corresponding to the particle , with real line @xmath110 representing time .",
    "thus in the zeroth order of perturbative expansion , i.e. , in the `` no local gravity limit of quantum gravity '' our theory is described by a holographic quantum @xmath0 chern ",
    "simons theory with particles .    in what follows we recall the construction of alekseev and malkin @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite , from which we borrowed the notation ) . in the case",
    "when the topology of the boundary of spacetime is simple ( no handles ) and thus reflects only the presence of particles exhibited by punctures , the topological degrees of freedom of gravity can be absorbed by particle s .",
    "thus effectively we obtain a ( possibly deformed ) theory of particles kinematics .",
    "as stressed above this theory could only depend on gauge group elements , as positions in spacetime do not play any role .    in",
    "what follows we will consider only the classical theory .",
    "the symplectic form on the space of gauge field and particles configurations can be easily found from the action ( [ actioncs ] ) and reads @xmath111 this symplectic form is subject to the constraint @xmath112 which makes the curvature zero everywhere except for the positions of the particles .",
    "it follows that the connection @xmath105 takes simple form at appropriately defined submanifolds of @xmath113 .",
    "alekseev and malkin @xcite define these submanifolds as follows . take a point @xmath114 away from the punctures and construct loops @xmath115 with this base point around each puncture ( figure 1 ) .",
    "along these loops we will later calculate holonomies .",
    "now cut the surface along the loops and remove the so obtained discs . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath68 punctured discs @xmath116 and the polygon @xmath117 with no punctures inside , whose boundary will contain exactly @xmath68 edges which we denote @xmath115 and vertices @xmath118 @xmath119 ( figure 2 )",
    ".    now the first term in ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be decomposed as follows @xmath120    the virtue of the decomposition ( [ 2.3 ] ) is that on each region the form of the connection is quite simple . consider the region @xmath117 first .",
    "since there are no punctures in this simply connected region the constraint ( [ 2.2 ] ) tells that connection @xmath105 is trivial there @xmath121 then by direct calculation one can convince oneself that the first integral in ( [ 2.3 ] ) reduces to the boundary one @xmath122        the contribution from the discs @xmath116 can be found by similar analysis .",
    "the only difference is that now we have to do with a region with puncture inside , carrying the charge , being an element of gauge algebra .",
    "since the curvature must have the delta singularity at the puncture , the most general connections on the disc must be given by gauge transformations of the canonical ones .",
    "the latter are defined by @xmath123 where @xmath124 are angular coordinates , that along with the radial ones ( defined such that the singularity corresponds to @xmath125 ) can be introduced on the disks globally .",
    "thus @xmath126 it is easy to see that since @xmath127 this connection solves the constraint ( [ 2.2 ] ) if @xmath128 . plugging ( [ 2.6 ] ) to one of the @xmath116 integrals in ( [ 2.3",
    "] ) we find @xmath129 @xmath130 notice that the sum of the first terms in ( [ 2.7 ] ) cancels exactly the second term in ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "thus the symplectic form is a sum of ( [ 2.5 ] ) and the last two terms in ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",

    "let us consider again the polygon @xmath135 .",
    "it has @xmath68 vertices @xmath136 connected by edges @xmath115 . since the connection is trivial on the polygon , the parallel transport along an edge is given simply by a product of the gauge parameters at the beginning and the end of the edge @xmath137 but because of the continuity of the connection the values of @xmath138 at the vertices of the of the polygon @xmath135 are just the products of holonomies @xmath139 of the connection of the disks @xmath140 next , since the connection @xmath141 is single valued on each disk it is clear from ( [ 2.6 ] ) that each holonomy is of the form @xmath142    now we are ready to present the central result of this section , the alekseev  malkin theorem @xcite : the symplectic form @xmath143 ( [ 2.1 ] ) gets contributions only from vertices of the polygon @xmath117 and reads @xmath144    the first term in this expression is a deformed kinetic term ( a deformation of the standard free particle symplectic form @xmath145 , and the second describes some `` topological interaction '' of the particles .",
    "notice that as expected the final form of the symplectic structure does contain no trace of the connection ; there is as many degrees of freedom as the number of particles , each described by a gauge group element .",
    "in this way the topological degrees of freedom of gravity has been `` eaten '' by the particle s ones .",
    "we will discuss the theory of particles provided by this symplectic structure in the next section .",
    "having obtained the symplectic form for single particle ( [ 2.12 ] ) , let us try to understand in which sense it describes a deformed particle . to do that",
    "let us first compare it with with an analogous expression for free particle moving in 4 dimensional de sitter spacetime in the limit of vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "the lagrangian for such particle is given by equation ( [ 0.7 ] ) and reads ( following @xcite we represent @xmath0 generators by gamma matrices , @xmath146 $ ] , @xmath147 with @xmath148 matrix denoted here @xmath149 ) @xmath150 where @xmath30 with @xmath19 being the cosmological length scale , related to the cosmological constant , cf .",

    "we can treat these components as independent adding to the lagrangian the on shell constraint @xmath161 .",

    "one can then easily check using definition of momenta ( [ 3.4a ] ) and the expansion ( [ 3.2a ] ) that ( [ 3.5 ] ) exactly reproduces ( up to the sign and a prefactor depending on immirzi parameter ) the free particle symplectic structure . we conclude that the first term in ( [ 2.12 ] ) is just a sum of free particle actions .",
    "let us now turn to the second , interaction term , in the symplectic form ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "as an example consider the case of two particles . in this case",
    "the interaction term reads @xmath171 to calculate this let us first expand the holonomy in powers of @xmath19 , by making use of the cartan decomposition of the group ( [ 3.2a ] ) and definition of momenta ( [ 3.4a ] ) @xmath172 thus @xmath173 @xmath174 equation ( [ 3.8 ] ) can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of particles , and knowing the symplectic form one can readily reproduce the lagrangian for the n - particles system .",
    "it is a sum of the standard kinetic terms and the on shell constraints for each particle along with the interaction terms @xmath175 + \\frac1{\\kappa^2 } p^{(i)}\\cdot \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1 } \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\ , p^{(j ) } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the affine parameter and @xmath176 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the mass shell constraints , and @xmath177 is the standard minkowski product",
    ".    equation ( [ 3.9 ] ) is the final result of our paper .",
    "it shows that in the action of @xmath68-particles system , the actions of each particle is not deformed while the deformation arises in the form of the presence of the additional interaction terms .",
    "it is worth noticing that this deformation does not change equations of motion ( because the momenta @xmath178 are constants of motion ) , while it certainly changes the poisson brackets .",
    "in particular the brackets of positions will not vanish anymore .",
    "however , it is easy to see that by simple change of variables @xmath179 the lagrangian ( [ 3.9 ] ) can be cast into the form of the one of the standard system of free relativistic particles .",
    "the results of the preceding section can be regarded surprising . building on the experience with @xmath2 gravity one would expect that the deformation of the final particle action is essentially guaranteed , and the recent investigations reported in @xcite suggested that the deformation was to be of @xmath4-poincar form @xcite .",
    "instead what we got was just a standard undeformed relativistic particles action .",
    "let us therefore try to understand this result .",
    "to get some more insight let us try to investigate how the results above change if we go beyond the the leading order in large cosmological scale @xmath19 expansion .",
    "our starting point is again the formula ( [ 3.5 ] ) @xmath180 using the definition of momenta and cartan decomposition as above one computes @xmath181 with momenta restricted to be on - shell @xmath182 .",
    "it is now convenient to parametrize the translational part of the group as follows @xmath183 with ( dimensionless ) positions @xmath184 belonging to de sitter space @xmath185 plugging this into the symplectic form above after straightforward calculations we find @xmath186 it follows that the lagrangian is again up to the irrelevant prefactor just the one of a relativistic particle moving on de sitter background : defining @xmath187 we have @xmath188\\ ] ] notice that again we see no trace of any deformation and both the symplectic structure and the lagrangian are linear in momenta , which makes the position space commutative .",
    "however we were not able yet to calculate the second `` interaction '' terms of the symplectic structure beyond the leading term in large @xmath19 expansion , which may change the picture considerably .",
    "it is a general result of alekseev and malkin @xcite that such interactions can be removed by an appropriate symplectic transformation . in this transformation",
    "the borel subroup of the original gauge group is known to play a role , and on the other hand it is directly related to @xmath4-poincar algebra and @xmath4-minkowski space @xcite .",
    "one should also remember that in order to get the @xmath4-poincar algebra as a contraction limit of @xmath189 , a nontrivial rescaling of momenta is required ( see @xcite and @xcite for details . )",
    "although such rescaling is well motivated mathematically , it is not clear how to justify it physically .",
    "we are going to address all these questions in the forthcoming paper .",
