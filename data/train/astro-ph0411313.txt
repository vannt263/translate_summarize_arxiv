    "astrophysical jets are observed from a wide range of systems , including active galactic nuclei @xcite , young stellar objects @xcite , accreting white dwarfs in symbiotic binaries @xcite and super - soft x - ray sources @xcite , and neutron stars and black holes in x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "although it is generally accepted that the power supplied from these jets has its origin in accretion , the details of the mechanisms producing the jets are not fully established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* falcke , krding , & markoff 2004 ) .",
    "observationally , one possible impediment to understanding these mechanisms is that the jets probably form on the time scales at which changes occur in the accretion flow ( e.g. , the viscous time scale ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for young stellar objects and active galactic nuclei ,",
    "that time scale is months to years , which makes it difficult to obtain well - sampled observations of jets as they form .",
    "therefore , in trying to establish what conditions are needed to produce jets , it is often hard to disentangle the relative importance of the state of the accretion flow from the physical properties of the systems as a whole , such as the binary orbital period or the rotation rate of the accreting object .",
    "the exceptions are accreting compact objects , in which , because of their small size , the structure of their accretion flows are observed to change on time scales of hours to days .",
    "recent observations of x - ray binaries have provided the first information about the time - dependent relationship between the accretion flow and the formation of jets ( e.g. , mirabel  1998 ; fomalont , geldzahler , & bradshaw 2001 ; fender  2004 ; fender , gallo , & belloni 2004 ) .",
    "a particularly striking picture of the relationship between accretion and jets has emerged for black hole x - ray binaries ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the accretion flows can be characterized by three `` states '' based on the spectral and timing properties of their x - ray and gamma - ray emission ( 0.5500 kev ) : ( 1 ) a hard state that usually occurs at relatively low accretion rates in which the x - ray emission forms a power - law with photon index @xmath1 that is exponentially cutoff at an energy of @xmath2  kev , and the power spectrum resembles band - limited white noise with a power of 1030% rms , ( 2 ) a thermal state at higher accretion rates , in which the x - ray emission resembles that expected from a canonical optically - thick , geometrically - thin accretion disk with a temperature of @xmath3  kev @xcite , and in which the power spectrum exhibits only weak noise ( 1 - 6% rms ) with a power - law shape ; and ( 3 ) a steep power - law state that is characterized by the sum of thermal emission plus a power - law of photon index @xmath4 that extends without a break to @xmath5 kev , and the power spectrum usually contains quasi - periodic oscillations at low - frequency ( 0.120  hz ) , and less often at high frequencies ( 150450  hz ) or in the mhz range ( see * ? ? ? * for further discussion ) .",
    "the radio emission associated with these states comes in two forms .",
    "first , optically thick radio emission from compact jets that extend only tens of au ( dhawan , mirabel , & rodrguez 2000 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is observed to coincide with the x - ray hard power - law state ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* gallo , fender , & pooley 2003 ) .",
    "the hard states and their jets can persist for days to months with relatively steady flux , and yet the jets become quenched when sources enter thermal - dominated states .",
    "second , transitions between these states are often observed to coincide with the formation of discrete synchrotron - emitting structures that travel relativistically across the sky ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these ballistic jets form on time scales of a day , and eventually travel thousands of au from the central black hole .",
    "x - ray binaries containing neutron stars with relatively weak magnetic fields ( @xmath7 gauss ; these are almost always found in low - mass x - ray binaries , or lmxbs ) resemble black hole systems in some respects , because the inner edge of the accretion disk can extend to near the inner most stable general relativistic orbit in both types of systems .",
    "however , the relationship between x - ray and radio emission from neutron star lmxbs has not been as firmly established .",
    "similarly to the black hole x - ray binaries , neutron star lmxbs exhibit a hard x - ray state with a @xmath1 . however , the analogs of the thermal - dominated and steep power - law states appear to be replaced by soft states in which most of the x - ray emission is produced by the boundary between the accretion disk and the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "transient radio emission has been observed from neutron star x - ray binaries during periods in which their x - ray spectrum was highly variable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) , and in two cases this emission was resolved into ballistic jets @xcite . however , the peak luminosity of their radio emission is a factor of @xmath8 lower than the black hole systems @xcite.two neutron star system were also detected in persistently soft states ( 4u 182030 and ser x-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this emission does not easily fit into the paradigm derived from black holes .",
    "however , no study has systematically targeted neutron star x - ray binaries in their hard , @xmath6 power - law states to determine whether or not they exhibit steady , compact radio jets .    in this paper , we search for radio emission from three neutron star lmxbs in hard x - ray states with the very large array ( vla ) in order to determine whether the formation of compact jets affected by changing the central compact object from a black hole to a neutron star .",
    "we have observed three systems that remained in hard , @xmath6 power - law states for the first five years of observations with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) : 1e 1724307  in terzan 2 , slx 1735269 , and 4u 181212 .",
    "each of these systems exhibits thermonuclear x - ray bursts , which demonstrates unambiguously that they contain neutron stars @xcite . however , their x - ray properties are otherwise almost indistinguishable from those of black holes in their hard states @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : xte ] , we explain how we selected our sample of sources , and report on the x - ray emission derived with _",
    "rxte_. we include considerable detail in order to establish the degree to which these systems resemble black hole x - ray binaries in the hard state . in section  [ sec : vla ] , we report on strict upper limits to the radio emission from three lmxbs in our sample that were obtained with the vla , nearly simultaneous with the _ rxte_observations . in section  3",
    ", we discuss the implications of a lack of radio emission from neutron star lmxbs in the hard state .",
    "the basic observational properties of the three neutron star lmxbs that we have studied are listed in tables [ tab : vla ] and [ tab : xte ] .",
    "_ rxte _  carries three instruments : the all - sky monitor ( asm ) , consisting of three , 30 @xmath9 proportional counters sensitive between 1.512 kev that scan 80% of the sky every 90 minutes @xcite ; the proportional counter array ( pca ) , consisting of five , 1300 @xmath9 detectors that record events with capability for microsecond time resolution and 256 channels of spectral resolution between 260 kev @xcite ; and the high energy x - ray timing experiment , consisting of two clusters of scintillation detectors , each with an effective area of 800 @xmath10 and sensitivity between 15250 kev ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "data from all three instruments was used to characterize the x - ray emission from the lmxbs in our sample .",
    "we first used data from the pca and asm to identify several neutron star lmxbs that persistently remained in a hard state ( sometimes also referred to as the `` island '' of the atoll - shape in the color - color diagram ) from the sample of systems that exhibit thermonuclear x - ray bursts ( d. galloway , in preparation ) .",
    "we first confirmed that the x - ray emission was steady using data from the _ rxte _  asm .",
    "we then measured the hardness of the x - ray spectrum using a hard color , which was defined as the ratio of the background - subtracted pca counts in the ( 8.618.0)/(5.08.6 ) kev energy bands , where the counts were normalized to account for changes in the gain of the proportional counter units ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "eight sources qualified as persistently hard , and we were able to obtain _ rxte _  and vla observations with a day of each other for three of these sources : 4u 181212 , slx 1735269 , and 1e 1724307 .",
    "the asm light curves and pca color - color diagrams from 8 years of observations are displayed    in figure  [ fig : asm ] . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we report the x - ray spectral and timing properties from _ rxte _",
    "observations taken within 6 weeks of the vla observations .      to produce spectra , we extracted data in 128 energy channels from the top layer of each active detector of the pca , and in 64 channels from cluster 0 of hexte . for the pca , the detector response and background were estimated using standard tools in ftools version 5.1 .",
    "for hexte , the background from the intervals in which the cluster was pointed off - source , and the response and effective area estimates were obtained from caldb version 2.23 .",
    "we modeled the spectra jointly in xspec version 11.2 , using the 325 kev energy range from the pca , and the 15200 kev energy range from hexte .",
    "we applied a constant normalization to account for differences in the calibrated effective area of the pca and hexte , and a 1% systematic uncertainty added in quadrature to the count spectra from the pca to account for uncertainties in the detector calibration near the xe edge at 4.5 kev . after confirming that the spectrum did not vary significantly over the course of the observations that we considered , we averaged the spectra to obtain better signal - to - noise at high energies .",
    "the resulting spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "we modeled the spectra using a phenomenological model that included a power - law continuum that produced most of the 2.5200 kev flux ; a blackbody component at low energies to remove residuals below 4  kev , which could result from emission from the neutron star s surface or the inner accretion disk ; a reflection component to account for residuals between 67 and 1020 kev ( refsch in xspec * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , which may be produced by hard x - rays impinging on an optically thick accretion disk ; and low - energy absorption caused by interstellar gas . the column density of interstellar matter ( @xmath11 )",

    "asca _  or _ bepposax",

    "the parameters of the reflection component could not all be constrained independently , so we fixed the inner and outer radii of the disk to 10 and 100 gravitational radii ( @xmath12 ) , the power law index for reflection emissivity to -2 , the metal abundances to their solar values , the inclination to 30@xmath13 , the disk temperature to 30,000 k , and the ionization fraction to 100 .",

    "the spectra of the black hole candidates , however , are often a bit flatter ( @xmath18 ) than the neutron star systems ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we produced power spectra using pca data with 122 @xmath20s ( @xmath21 s ) time resolution in a single energy channel ( effectively 230  kev ) .",
    "we computed power spectra in 256  s intervals , and averaged them weighted by the total counts to produce an accurate estimate of the continuum power .",
    "we then subtracted the deadtime - corrected poisson noise level from the power spectra @xcite , re - binned    them logarithmically , and estimated uncertainties from the standard deviation in the individual points averaged to compute the final power spectrum . to quantify the shape of the power spectrum , we modeled the continuum with several zero - centered lorentzian functions , and any qpos with lorentzians with variable centroid frequencies .",

    "the neutron star lmxbs in our sample have the lowest radio luminosities of the x - ray binaries in figure  [ fig : lrlx ] .",
    "several authors have found that the relationship between the x - ray and radio luminosities of both individual black hole systems and the ensemble of systems follows the relationship @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this scaling follows the spectral energy distribution expected from models of a standard conical radio jet that extracts a fixed fraction of the total    energy from accretion ( * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , we also plot in figure  [ fig : lrlx ] lines of @xmath24 that intercept data from v404 cyg , cyg x-1 , and grs 1758258 ; these lines bound the observed scatter in radio luminosities .",
    "the upper limits on the radio luminosities of the neutron star x - ray binaries are equal to or below the line of @xmath24 that passes through the faintest black hole x - ray binary observed in the hard x - ray state , grs 1758258 @xcite .",
    "the strictest 1-@xmath23 upper limit on the radio luminosity , from 1e 1724307 , is a factor of @xmath25 below the relationship for grs 1758258 . for comparison",
    ", there is a factor of @xmath8 difference in the radio luminosities of grs 1758258 and those of v404 cyg and gx 3394 .    by comparing a sample of accreting black holes in x - ray binaries and active galactic nucleii , @xcite and @xcite have found an additional dependence on black hole mass : @xmath26 .",
    "this dependence is also expected from conical jet models @xcite .",
    "therefore , in figure  [ fig : lrlx_m ] we re - plot the data in figure  [ fig : lrlx ] with the @xmath27-axis scaled by a factor @xmath28 . since all of the black holes in the sample have masses that are between 515 @xmath29  @xcite , the proposed dependence on mass does not account for the scatter in the @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 relationship for black holes .",
    "however , accounting for the fact that the neutron stars are likely to have masses near 1.4 @xmath29  @xcite shifts them so that the upper limits on their radio luminosities are consistent with the relationship defined by grs 1758258 .",
    "however , the mean luminosity of the neutron star lmxbs is still lower than that of the black holes .",
    "unfortunately , the individual upper limits on the radio emission from the three neutron star lmxbs are not strict enough to establish a clear difference between the production of jets from accreting black holes and neutron stars .",
    "nevertheless , the low radio luminosities of the neutron star systems do raise further questions as to the origin of the dispersion in the radio luminosities of accreting x - ray binaries in hard x - ray states .",
    "@xcite suggested that grs 1758258 has an anomalously low radio luminosity because its jets have been `` quenched '' by an unknown mechanism that begins to operate when black holes accrete at a few percent of the eddington rate .",
    "indeed , all four sources with low radio luminosities have @xmath32 .",
    "however , the quenching mechanism would have to activate in these systems without manifesting any obvious cause ( or reaction ) in the energy spectrum and timing properties of the x - ray emission ( see lin  2000 for grs 1758258 , and figures  [ fig : spec ] and [ fig : pds ] for the neutron star lmxbs ) . further insight into the possible causes of the relative faintness of the the radio emission during the hard x - ray states of grs 1758258 , 1e 1724307 , 4u 181212 , and slx 1735269 can be found by considering current models explaining why hard x - ray and radio emission are observed together .",
    "for instance , several authors have suggested that the structure of the accretion flow is more conducive to launching jets in the hard state than in the soft , most likely because the geometry of the accretion flow differs ( meier , koide , & uchida 2001 ; meier 2001 ; merloni & fabian 2002 ) .",
    "specifically , the hard x - ray state is thought to occur when the accretion flow is radiatively inefficient and geometrically thick , whereas the thermal - dominate state is assumed to occur when the accretion disk is radiatively - efficient and geometrically thin ( e.g. , esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) .",
    "at the same time , the jets are assumed to be formed by threading matter onto a poloidal magnetic field anchored to the rotating accretion flow @xcite , while the fields are generated by turbulent motions in the accretion flow . since the scale heights of the turbulent motions are much larger when the flow is geometrically thick , stronger magnetic fields and more powerful jets are produced in the hard state .",
    "under this model , there is no obvious reason to associate the faintness of the radio emission from grs 1758258 and the neutron star lmxbs with the `` quenching '' of what would otherwise be a powerful compact jet , since the x - ray emission from these sources are almost indistinguishable from those of radio - luminous sources such as cyg x-1 .",
    "instead , it seems more natural to assume that another physical or observational property of the radio - faint sources differs from the radio - luminous ones .",
    "another basic explanation for the association is that the hard x - rays are produced by optically - thin synchrotron emission from the electrons in the jet ( markoff , falcke , & fender 2001 ; markoff  2003 ; note that in this case the mechanism for launching the jet is unspecified ) . under this model",
    ", there is little freedom to assume that the jet power is simply lower in grs 1758 - 298 and the neutron star lmxbs during their hard states , because the x - ray emission is produced in the jet .",
    "one option is to assume that the break frequency at which the synchrotron emission from the jet changes from optically thick to optically thin shifts to higher frequencies , so that the x - ray luminosity from the jet is preserved , while the radio luminosity at 5 ghz declines .",
    "this could be accommodated if the shock that accelerates the x - ray emitting electrons in the jet forms closer to the accreting compact object .",
    "since the shock is positioned @xmath33 gravitational radii from the black holes in the models for xte j1118 + 480 and gx 3394 presented by @xcite , in principle there is plenty of room for it to move .",
    "moreover , the presence of stronger noise in the power spectra of the neutron star lmxbs above @xmath34  hz in figure  [ fig : pds ] could also be taken as evidence that the x - ray emitting region is closer to the compact object .",
    "alternatively , some of the x - ray emission may be produced by synchrotron self - compton emission , which would allow for some decoupling between the x - ray and radio emission ( s. markoff , m. nowak , & j. wilms , in preparation ) .",
    "given the tentativeness of the above arguments , we believe it also is important to consider whether the dispersion observed in the radio luminosity from the ensemble of black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries is caused by differences in the physical or observational parameters of the systems . for instance , @xcite examined the degree to which doppler boosting of the radio and x - ray emission could produce dispersion in the @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 relationship , and concluded that the tightness of the correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 erg s@xmath37 implies that the bulk motion of the jets can be no more than @xmath38 .",
    "however , they specifically omitted the data from grs 1758258 , which they assumed was quenched in the radio ; including that source and the neutron star lmxbs could point toward a larger importance for doppler boosting .",
    "the presence of a hard surface near the inner edge of the accretion disk is another factor that distinguishes neutron star lmxbs from those containing black holes .",
    "the hard surface must arrest the accretion flow , which would form a boundary layer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that could alter the structure of a jet or produce photons that cool the electrons in the jet . however , it is difficult to believe that this is the explanation for the faintness of the radio emission from the neutron stars , because there are not significant differences in the x - ray spectral or timing components seen from the black hole and neutron star systems that can be attributed unambiguously to such a boundary layer in the latter systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] and [ fig : pds ] ) .",
    "finally , it has also been suggested that the depth of the gravitational potential out of which the jets are produced can greatly influence their strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in black hole systems ,",
    "the inner radius at which a stable accretion disk can exist depends on the black hole spin ; in a neutron star systems , it is most likely set by either the surface of the star , or by a dipole field anchored to the star .",
    "the low radio luminosities of grs 1758298 , 1e 1724307 , 4u 181212 , and slx 1735269 could then be explained by the relative shallowness of their potentials . for the neutron stars",
    ", the difference would be due to the nature of the compact object ; for grs 1758258 , the difference could be explained if the black hole was either non - rotating , or rotating with an angular momentum opposite to that of the accretion disk .",
    "we have obtained upper limits on the radio emission from three neutron star lmxbs , concurrent with x - ray observations that demonstrated that they were in a hard x - ray state .",
    "we have compared these upper limits to the radio luminosities of several black holes in very similar hard states , and found that the neutron star systems are as faint as or fainter than the black hole candidate with the lowest observed radio luminosity , grs 1758258 . the difference in radio luminosity",
    "can partly be attributed to the lower masses of the neutron star systems , which on theoretical and observational grounds is expected to decrease as @xmath0 .",
    "however , there still remains a factor of 30 scatter in the radio luminosities of black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries , particularly at x - ray luminosities of a few percent eddington .",
    "we find no obvious differences in the x - ray timing and spectral properties that explain this dispersion .",
    "two future observations could help resolve why there is such a large dispersion in the radio luminosities of black hole x - ray binaries , and why neutron stars tend to fall on or below the faint end of this dispersion .",
    "first , it is important to either detect , or place much stricter upper limits on , the radio luminosities of neutron star lmxbs in the x - ray hard state .",
    "this would help resolve whether there is indeed a physical difference that causes the relative faintness of neutron star lmxbs , or whether the three sources we observe just happen to fall on the low end of a dispersion in radio luminosity .",
    "second , radio observations of the fainter radio sources , i.e. grs 1758298 and the neutron star lmxbs , at lower x - ray luminosities could reveal whether they are indeed quenched near @xmath39 , or whether another parameter is needed to explain the radio luminosity of x - ray binaries in hard states",

    "<S> we report strict upper limits to the radio luminosities of three neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries obtained with the very large array while they were in hard x - ray states as observed with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ : 1e 1724307 , 4u 181212 , and slx 1735269 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these upper limits to the radio luminosities of several black hole binaries in very similar hard states , and find that the neutron star systems are as faint as or fainter than all of the black hole candidates . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in luminosities can partly be attributed to the lower masses of the neutron star systems , which on theoretical and observational grounds are expected to decrease the radio luminosities as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there still remains a factor of 30 scatter in the radio luminosities of black hole and neutron star x - ray binaries , particularly at x - ray luminosities of a few percent eddington . </S>",
    "<S> we find no obvious differences in the x - ray timing and spectral properties that can be correlated with the radio luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these results on current models for the relationship between accretion and jets . </S>"
