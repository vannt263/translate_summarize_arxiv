    "recent advances that allow virial black - hole masses in nearby quiescent and active galaxies to be measured have opened a new era : with mass measurements we can address issues of the physics of black - hole evolution and its connection with galaxy evolution . some obvious first questions to ask are what is the typical mass of black holes in agns at high redshift , and is this different from those of lower-@xmath4 agns ? also , does the typical mass of luminous quasars change beyond the redshift ( @xmath5 ) at which the co - moving space density of quasars drops dramatically ?",
    "a study addressing these issues ( vestergaard 2004 , hereafter paper  i ) is summarized below .",
    "as summarized by vestergaard at this meeting , obtaining direct virial black - hole mass ( @xmath6 ) measurements of large samples of distant quasars is very time - consuming and is , hence , impractical .",
    "instead , @xmath6 _ estimates _ can be more easily obtained with scaling relationships and measurements of broad - line width and continuum luminosity in a single - epoch uv or optical spectrum (  wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; vestergaard 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ) . the mass estimates presented here were obtained with such scaling relationships ( paper  i ) .",
    "but is it reasonable to assume that scaling relations , even those based on high - ionization lines , are valid for all agns and quasars ? while the efficacy of the scaling relations is discussed in more detail in paper  i , a few key points are worth emphasizing here . from the demonstrated virial relationships ( peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 ; onken & peterson 2002 ) for the broad emission lines , including the high - ionization lines ,",
    "we know that for a given object the distance to the line - emitting gas and its velocity dispersion each scale between the emission lines : for example , @xmath7(h@xmath8 ) @xmath9(h@xmath8 ) @xmath10(civ ) @xmath9(civ ) , where @xmath11 is the light travel time delay between the variations in the ionizing continuum and responding line emission . therefore , any broad emission - line width ( for which the virial relationship holds ) can be used as a measure of the velocity dispersion , @xmath12(line ) , at the distance of this line - emitting gas , @xmath13(line ) @xmath14(line ) .",
    "in addition , since all four agns that can be tested exhibit this virial relationship , it is fair to assume it is universal in spite of the small number of agns on which this conclusion is based . moreover ,",
    "for the reasonable assumption that the broad - line region is photoionized one can show that if the radius ",
    "luminosity relationship did not apply to the luminous and high - redshift quasars , then their spectra would look very different than they actually do : composite quasar spectra grouped by luminosity and redshift are surprisingly similar at least up to redshifts of @xmath154.5 (  dietrich 2002 ) .",
    "also , the application of the radius  luminosity relation to the most luminous ( high - redshift ) quasars is only an extrapolation of at most 1.5 dex beyond the luminosity range of 4 dex over which the relationship is defined ( kaspi 2000 ) .",
    "thus , there are no immediate concerns that the radius  luminosity relationship",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of estimated @xmath6 values for several samples of quasars : 87 objects from the bright quasar survey at @xmath16 , a sample of @xmath17 quasars , and recently published samples of @xmath18 quasars , including sdss edr data (  anderson 2001 ; fan 2001 ; constantin 2002 ) . a cosmology with @xmath19 = 75 @xmath20 ,",
    "q@xmath21 = 0.5 , and @xmath22 = 0 is used .",
    "the reader is referred to paper  i for further details . for these samples",
    "figure  2a shows the distributions of the bolometric luminosities , @xmath23 , determined by applying bolometric correction factors to measured monochromatic continuum luminosities .",
    "the lower envelopes in both the @xmath23 and @xmath6 values are due to the flux limits in the sample selection or in the original surveys .",
    "figure  2b displays the redshift distribution of the eddington luminosity ratio of the samples .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the @xmath24 values is significant ( @xmath250.7dex ) due to the need to apply an average bolometric correction to obtain @xmath23 and due to the accuracy of the @xmath6 estimates ( 1@xmath26error is@xmath150.5dex relative to reverberation masses ) . the observed range in @xmath24 values is the result of selection flux limits ( lower envelope ) and the combination of a minimum line - width adopted ( @xmath152000km / s ) to identify quasars and the observed upper @xmath23 envelope",
    "nonetheless , these crude @xmath24 estimates show that massive , high-@xmath4 quasars have eddington ratios of order 0.1@xmath271.0 , as commonly expected , as opposed to super - eddington or    * distant , luminous quasars have very massive black holes , even at the highest redshifts . in other words ,",
    "black holes with very large masses , @xmath6 @xmath28 , exist at large redshifts  beyond the space density drop at @xmath5 and even as early as @xmath29 6 .",
    "* there appears to be a real physical ceiling of @xmath6 @xmath30 and @xmath23 @xmath31 ^ -1 ergss@xmath32 .",
    "this is partly owing to the steep cutoff in the upper end of the luminosity ( and mass ) function .",
    "in addition , this may signify a maximum sustainable mass and luminosity . *",
    "the early appearance of supermassive black holes suggests that they form early or fast .",
    "in fact , they may even form faster than the stars in the host galaxy as suggested by studies of high-@xmath4 host galaxies ( see below ) .    the notion that active massive black holes at high-@xmath4 may reside in relatively young galaxies",
    "is based on largely circumstantial evidence that host galaxies of agns at @xmath333 do not typically appear fully formed or have old stellar populations ( see paper  i for a more detailed discussion ) : ( a ) the presence of large masses of cold molecular gas in high-@xmath4 hosts (  significant fuel exists for future star formation ) which for some high-@xmath4 sources are clearly separated from the agn nucleus or is distinctly extended (  ohta 1996 ; papadopoulos 2000 ; carilli 2002 , 2003 ) , ( b ) inferred high star - formation rates from the far - ir luminosities in 2001 ) , ( c ) the presence of large - scale young stellar populations confirmed in at least one well - studied @xmath18 radio galaxy with high far - ir luminosity , 4c41.17 (  dey 1997 ) , ( d ) the strikingly different morphology of host galaxies of high-@xmath4 radio - quiet quasars and radio galaxies compared to their lower-@xmath4 cousins : radio galaxies exhibit multiple components embedded in large - scale diffuse emission indicative of non - relaxed systems in the process of forming (  van breugel 1998 ) while radio - quiet quasars appear to have smaller scale - lengths and a fraction of their final stellar mass (  ridgway 2001 ; papovich 2001 ) , and ( e ) the presence of massive , active black holes ( @xmath34 ; marked ` lbg - agn ' in figures  1 and 2 ) in lyman - break galaxies at @xmath35 ; these are typically small , young starforming galaxies ( steidel 2002 ) .",
