    "drell - yan production in the forward direction is dominated by the quark - gluon fusion , where especially at not too large invariant masses of the dilepton system the gluon density is probed at low values of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 .",
    "one might therefore probe a kinematic range where gluon saturation effects are potentially large . consequently the forward drell - yan process has been discussed in the color - glass condensate approach in @xcite .",
    "recently much attention has also been paid to appplications of the color dipole approach to the drell - yan process at the lhc ( see e.g. @xcite )    in this talk we instead present an alternative formulation in momentum space published recently in @xcite . in particular , this approach includes all the four structure functions @xcite of the drell - yan process and allows to put cuts on the momenta of individual leptons ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
