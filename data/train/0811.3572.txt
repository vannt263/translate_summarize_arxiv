    "the distribution of the hall potential close to the current injecting ohmic contacts is crucial for deriving the current - voltage relation .",
    "the analytic solution of laplace s equation with the boundary condition of a given voltage difference @xmath1 between the two ohmic contacts and no current leaving the sample along the long sides @xcite leads to a highly non - uniform potential and current distribution , shown in figure  1 .",

    "several experiments have imaged either the hall potential directly @xcite or the resulting hot spots in opposite corners of the device @xcite and thus established the validity of the classical hall field calculation with its high electric field values at two corners even in the quantum hall regime .",

    "( [ eq : laplace_potential ] ) can be considerably simplified in two regions : in the middle of the device at @xmath60 , where it becomes the solution of a parallel - plate capacitor , with plates parallel to the @xmath51-axis at @xmath61 and a potential difference of @xmath1 : @xmath62 the resulting electric field is constant and directed in the @xmath53-direction : @xmath63 another most important simplification happens in the hot - spot corner of the device . there",
    ", the solution is given by the electrostatic potential of a rectangular corner , where the two sides have a potential difference @xmath1 : @xmath64 or in cylindrical coordinates @xmath65 with respect to the corner @xmath66 the electrical field points along the unit vector @xmath67 and is given by @xmath68 the corner and the middle of the device are covered by a single conformal mapping . the existence of a conformal map allows to introduce a set of local orthogonal coordinates . in the middle of the device",

    "next , we discuss the local density of states ( ldos ) close to the corner .",
    "for the uniform field case with hamiltonian @xmath76 the ldos is derived in @xcite . the ldos ( without spin ) in crossed electric and magnetic fields is given by @xmath77}^2.\\ ] ] here , the level width parameter @xmath78 is related to the magnetic length @xmath79 , the electric field @xmath80 , and @xmath81 denotes the effective energy shift for the @xmath82th level : @xmath83 the electron spin leads to a shift of the ldos and we obtain the ldos in the presence of spin , @xmath84 for the hamiltonian @xmath85 we have to perform a numerical calculation of the ldos by tracking the autocorrelation function of a wavepacket which is propagated using fast fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "the resulting ldos is to a very high accuracy ( for @xmath86  mv better than @xmath87 ) approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ldos ] ) , provided we set @xmath88 for smaller @xmath1 we obtain an even stronger numerical bound .",
    "the accuracy is best tested by subtracting the analytical available time - dependent autocorrelation function in a homogeneous electric field from the one obtained by numerical propagation .    for the homogeneous case ,",
    "the expectation value of the kinematic velocity @xmath89 through a flux line along @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 likewise we obtain in the corner geometry for the flux through a line along @xmath67 , @xmath92",
    "while the ldos ( and the velocity ) depend on the local field gradient , it is crucial to realize that the gaps of the ldos in the middle of even landau levels survive the averaging process over a wide range of local field gradients .",
    "however , other oscillatory structures in higher landau levels are affected by the field - average and may disappear .",
    "the disappearance of the gaps at small currents ( here for @xmath93  na ) is caused by the convolution of the ldos with the fermi - dirac distribution at the liquid helium temperature @xmath94  k.    in principle , the electric field suffers from the mathematical singularity at the corner where @xmath95 .",
    "however , we will assume that the non - uniformity of the contacts will weaken the singularity and thus limit the upper value of the electric field .",
    "an exact model of the environment around the singularity is beyond the scope of the present paper , but the experimentally observed structures allows us to pin down the effective distance from the singularity to @xmath96  nm for a magnetic field around 3 tesla , which leads to a 300-fold amplification of the electric field at the injection region compared to the middle of the device .",
    "this distance corresponds to @xmath97 cyclotron diameters . in the present modelling",
    ", we distribute incoherent emitters with equal angular spacing on a quarter circle of radius @xmath98  nm .",
    "the hall angle in the used high mobility samples is between @xmath99 and the current is flowing almost perpendicular to the electric field vector ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the equipotential lines near the hot spots are radial rays , while the lines of equal electric field are quarter - circles .",
    "equipotential lines of equal angular spacing from the corner are transformed into parallel lines of equal distance in the middle of the hall bar . in the presence of a magnetic field , the electrons move on these equipotential lines .",
    "thus a point source emitting with uniform intensity along the quarter circle will populate the middle of the hall bar uniformly . in the classical theory",
    ", we can calculate the average velocity of the electrons along a slice across the middle of hall bar of width @xmath52 and length @xmath50 using the classical equations of motions : @xmath100 we obtain the classical hall coefficient by considering a uniform density of electrons @xmath101 across the middle of the device which originates from a uniform , isotropic emission from a quarter circle close to the hot spot .",
    "the voltage drop across the device is equal to the source - drain voltage @xmath102 .",
    "thus the current becomes just @xmath103 and the hall resistance is given by @xmath104 next , we translate the classical considerations into the corresponding quantum mechanical model . as in the classical model , we consider the position of the hot - spot at the current injecting edge as the electron source for the current through the device .",
    "however , this time we study the quantum - mechanical emission and propagation of the electrons . to this end",
    ", we model the current injecting hot spot by a quarter - circle with a fixed radial distance @xmath105 from the mathematical singularity at @xmath95 .",
    "the hamiltonian in the vicinity of the corner is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcorner ] ) .",
    "we calculate the contribution to the total current of each source at position @xmath106 along the quarter circle by integrating over the product of the ldos @xmath107 at the emission point with the expectation value of the kinematic velocity of the emitted particle : @xmath108 where we used the results for the ldos and the velocity given in sect .",
    "[ sec : ldos ] . for evaluating the above equation along the quarter - circle ,",
    "we take the dissipative nature of the hot - spot into account by launching wavepackets with the same initial kinetic energy , independent of their starting point on the circle .",
    "this assumption is supported by two experimental observations : ( i ) the hot - spot shows indeed an increased temperature compared to the rest of the device , and ( ii ) the qhe and the unique fingerprint of the modulations within a landau level are prominently visible even for hall potentials exceeding the energetic difference between two landau levels by a factor of 10 .",
    "the conformal mapping assures that the isotropic emission from the corner flowing from the quarter circle is transformed into a homogeneous flow across the full width of the device @xmath52 .",
    "also the potential drop along the quarter circle is equal to the potential drop across the middle of the device .",
    "the quantum mechanical expression for the hall resistivity becomes @xmath109 the local density of states given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ldosspin ] ) depends strongly on the magnetic and electric field values . between two landau levels the ldos",
    "is exponentially suppressed , and it is broadenend and modulated within each landau level with a zero in the center of even landau levels .",
    "now we are in a position to self - consistently solve the equations for given magnetic field @xmath110 , temperature @xmath17 , fermi energy @xmath111 , and current @xmath2 ( which is fixed in the experiment by a constant - current source ) .",
    "experimentally , the gate voltage @xmath112 can be used to change the fermi energy and thus the average electron density . in this experiment @xmath113",
    "is fixed , and thus the fermi - energy is given by the average electron density @xmath114 divided by the average dos @xmath115 , yielding @xmath116  mev .    to calculate the source - drain - current  hall - voltage characteristics of the device ,",
    "we fix the hall angle @xmath117 .",
    "then we proceed in the following way :    1 .",
    "make an initial guess of the source - drain voltage @xmath1 ( i.e. by using the classical hall effect ) .",
    "2 .   from eq .",
    "( [ eq : laplace_efield ] ) , obtain the electric hall field at a distance @xmath105 from the singularity .",
    "3 .   using eq .",
    "( [ eq : jsource ] ) , calculate the total current @xmath118 .",
    "4 .   compare @xmath118 with the experimentally given value @xmath2 .",
    "if the current is too large , reduce @xmath1 , otherwise increase @xmath1 .",
    "5 .   repeat these steps until convergence with respect to @xmath119 is reached .",
    "certain ranges of the magnetic field are of special importance and directly related to integer and half - integer structures : whenever the magnetic field is such that the fermi energy falls between two landau levels , the ldos is highly suppressed and we obtain the integrated ldos @xmath120 with filling factor @xmath121 .",
    "this yields the total current @xmath122 thus we recover the integer qhe with quantized conductivities @xmath36 .",
    "however there is a second interesting case , related to the substructure present in @xmath123 . for the filling factors @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the ldos has a zero in the middle of the landau level , whose position only very weakly depends on the electric field value ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the filling factors @xmath126 and @xmath125 are located in the middle of the second landau level .",
    "both filling factors are separated in energy due to the zeeman splitting @xmath127 caused by the electron spin with an effective g - factor . for higher electric fields ( caused by higher currents )",
    "we observe an overlap of the neighboring landau levels and an enhanced dos between the two landau levels .",
    "however , the zeroes of the dos around the two filling factors stand out at all field values , since they actually widen at higher fields .",
    "the appearance and widening of the gaps at @xmath124 and @xmath125 and the coalescence of the shoulders of the two levels are clearly visible in the experiment ( figure 3b ) and the theoretical calculation ( figure  3c ) .",
    "two main mechanisms lead to additional resistance in the system : the ohmic contacts into the device ( see the discussion of hot - spots above ) , and the redistribution of the emitted current in the device . from imaging the vicinity of a hot - spot using sfm @xcite , fig .  3",
    ", the following picture emerges : at distances closer than 500  nm from the hot - spot the hall potential becomes independent of slight variations of the magnetic fields , while starting at a distance of several @xmath5 m away from the injection region a redistribution of the hall potential takes place , which depends on the magnetic field .",
    "the above experimental findings are in line with our theoretical model of the origin of the hall plateaus , which predicts a more robust @xmath15 which is unaffected by screening , while the current distribution and voltage drop along the sample edges associated with @xmath14 are strongly affected by readjustments of the density caused by screening and disorder .",
    "the calculation of the screened potentials and ( in-)compressible stripes , relevant for determining @xmath14 along the middle section of the device , has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but in our model these stripes are not the reason for the existence of the hall plateaus in @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath14 is probed at a considerable distance from the hot - spot , it is more susceptible to disorder , screening , and gate structures and its calculation relies on more details of the sample than the calculation of @xmath15 : in the injection region the disorder effects are negligible because of the huge electric field strength imposed by the device geometry .",
    "the decoupling of the theoretical description of @xmath15 from the one of @xmath14 is an important consequence of our model : it can explain the generally observed differences between @xmath14 and @xmath128",
    ". however , some similarity still prevails , which can be seen in figure 2b , where the lack of available states right at the center of a landau level is also reflected in a dip in the longitudinal resistivity @xmath14 around @xmath129  t.",
    "the current densities used in the present experiments are much lower than the one reported for the breakdown of the iqhe ( @xmath130  am@xmath131 here , vs.  @xmath132  am@xmath131 in ref .",

    "<S> the quantum hall effect is one of the most important developments in condensed matter physics of the 20th century . </S>",
    "<S> the standard explanations of the famous integer quantized hall plateaus in the transverse resistivity are qualitative , and involve assumptions about disorder , localized states , extended states , edge states , fermi levels pinned by landau levels , etc . </S>",
    "<S> these standard narratives give plausible reasons for the existence of the plateaus , but provide little in the way of even a qualitative understanding of the shape and width of the hall plateaus , much less a first principles calculation @xcite . the injection model presented in this </S>",
    "<S> paper changes that situation . rather than focusing on the middle of the hall device , </S>",
    "<S> we follow the electrons to their source : one corner of the hall bar and its steep electric field gradients . </S>",
    "<S> we find the entire resistivity curve including the hall plateaus is calculable as a function of magnetic field , temperature , and current . </S>",
    "<S> the new higher current experiments reported here show remarkable half integer features for the first time ; these are faithfully reproduced by the injection theory . </S>",
    "<S> the hall plateaus and half integer inflections are shown to result from the local density of states appropriate to the magnetic field and the strong electric field gradient at the injection corner .    </S>",
    "<S> the classical hall effect generates a highly non - trivial electron flow pattern , electric field , and potential distribution , which originate from the boundary conditions imposed by the device geometry and the lorentz force acting on moving charges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extremely high electric fields are present in the vicinity of two opposite corners of a hall device ( figure 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have confirmed that this picture prevails in the quantum hall regime and that electrons enter the device in this high - field zone , where dissipation and heating take place @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the corners and their high - field injection zones do not play a significant role in any of the standard narratives about the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) . </S>",
    "<S> discussions focus instead on the center section of the hall bar , including the edges . the de - emphasis of contacts and the injection point goes so far as introduction of a fictitious translational invariance , crucial for example to laughlin s elegant gauge argument for the integer plateaus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the gritty job of understanding the flux of electrons through the corner from first principles has as its reward a calculable , quantitative understanding of the transverse resistivity hall plateaus . </S>",
    "<S> a satisfying continuity would prevail with the theory of quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) and two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) in the absence of a magnetic field , in which conductance is calculable in terms of the injection of electron flux at the qpc , without having to worry about the fate of the electrons after they leave the qpc , apart from any backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> because of the presence of a strong magnetic field leading electrons along potential contours and along edges , backscattering is not an issue in quantum hall experiments .    , while near the corner the electric field strength increases ( hot spot ) and the equipotential lines follow the radial unit vector @xmath0 and run isotropic perpendicular to quarter circles . </S>",
    "<S> the source - drain voltage @xmath1 is experimentally adjusted to deliver a constant direct current @xmath2 , and the hall resistivity is obtained by measuring the ratio @xmath3 , while the longitudinal resistivity is obtained via @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> this would seem to make calculations very difficult , especially considering the strong magnetic field which is present . </S>",

    "<S> we believe this central argument in traditional discussions is in fact not the key to an understanding of the iqhe . </S>",
    "<S> it is much more important to understand the _ local _ density of states at the point where electrons enter the device ; this is the `` injection theory '' idea . </S>",

    "<S> we solve the self - consistent relation between the voltage drop across the corner ( which broadens and modulates the ldos ) and the quantum mechanical current ( see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos in a quantum hall system ( figure  4 ) shows a very different behaviour from the dos of a disordered system : the ldos drops to zero in the middle of even landau levels , and thus transport is suppressed around the center of these landau levels , as predicted before in a uniform electric field environment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the gaps in the ldos disappear at low currents due to the convolution with the temperature broadened fermi - dirac distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that @xmath15 is not affected by local disorder perturbations in the injection region , since the corner geometry enforces a much stronger electric field gradient than the gradient caused by disorder fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the ohmic resistivity @xmath14 is probed later in the device , where the amplification effect of the hall field is absent . </S>",
    "<S> these two points explain the robustness of the quantization of @xmath15 against disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note we do not require any disorder ; it plays no essential role in our theory of @xmath15 in the iqhe , in keeping with the experimental trend of still observing the iqhe in ever cleaner samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also electrons confined to closed interior orbits in strong magnetic fields , while undoubtedly present , play no significant role in our theory .    </S>",
    "<S> certain values of the fermi energy are of special importance and directly related to integer and half - integer structures : whenever the magnetic field is such that the fermi energy falls between two landau levels , the ldos is highly suppressed and we obtain an integer filling factor @xmath35 and recover the iqhe with quantized conductivities @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> however there is a second interesting case , related to the substructure present in the ldos . for the filling factors @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> , the ldos has a zero in the middle of the landau level , whose position only very weakly depends on the electric field value . </S>",
    "<S> the filling factors @xmath24 and @xmath27 are located in the middle of the second landau level . </S>",
    "<S> both filling factors are separated in energy due to the zeeman splitting caused by the electron spin .    </S>",
    "<S> for higher electric fields ( caused by higher currents ) we observe ( figure 3b ) the widening of the zeroes of the ldos into gaps at @xmath19 and @xmath18 . at the same time the ldos in between the neighbouring spin - split landau levels is enhanced and the @xmath34 integer gap is no longer present . the theory ( fig .  4 and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) predicts the positions and widening of the gaps at the level centers , and the coalescence of their shoulders , in full agreement with the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> thus the new features in the experiments can be seen as of the ldos gaps _ in the center of the second landau level _ and provide conclusive evidence for the validity of the injection model of the quantum hall effect . </S>"
