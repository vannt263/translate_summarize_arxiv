    "the critical behavior of the antiferromagnetic vector spin models on the stacked triangular lattice ( sta ) is still a controversial issue even after twenty years of extensive studies by means of experimental , field - theoretical , and numerical methods .",
    "see @xcite for recent works , and @xcite for a review .    the field - theoretical renormalization group ( rg ) analysis tells that when the number of spin component @xmath5 is greater than some threshold value @xmath6 , there are so - called `` chiral fixed points '' of the rg which control the critical behavior and are characterized by novel values of critical exponents , while for @xmath7 such fixed points disappear and the phase transition is of first order ( see @xcitefor a review ) .",
    "theoretical estimations of @xmath6 have been made by various authors by means of @xmath8-expansion @xcite , fixed dimensional perturbation @xcite , local potential approximation @xcite , and effective average action approach @xcite , but the estimated values range from negative value to 6.5 , depending on the method employed ( however , recent results tend to be around 6.0 ) .",
    "thus the critical behaviors of the physical relevant cases @xmath3 ( xy spin ) and @xmath9 ( heisenberg spin ) are still unclear .",
    "a number of experimental studies @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite have yielded results which suggest second - order phase transition for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , recently it has been pointed out that the critical exponent @xmath10 , calculated from the scaling relation , becomes negative in some of these results , which is unphysical and indicates that the observed critical behavior is in fact pseudo - critical behavior induced by the slow rg flow @xcite .",
    "the present work intends to clarify the issue by numerically observing the rg flow and investigating whether there are chiral fixed points or not for several values of @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we will present the method by which we observe the rg flow in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "details of the monte carlo simulations are given in sec .",
    "[ mc ] . in sec .",
    "[ results ] the rg flow diagrams obtained from the simulations for @xmath11 cases are presented .",
    "the last section is devoted to the concluding remarks .",
    "the critical behavior of the @xmath5-component sta model is essentially described by the following @xmath0-component ginzburg - landau - wilson hamiltonian @xcite : h = dx , [ hamiltonian - c ] where @xmath12 is @xmath13-component vector field defined on the continuum space . in the field - theoretical studies , @xmath14 is fixed to unity to eliminate ambiguity of coefficients induced by a trivial rescaling of @xmath15 , namely , @xmath16 . in this regularization scheme , @xmath17 plays a role of temperature . in the present work we concentrate on the case @xmath18 .",
    "figure [ rgth00 ] depicts the renormalization group flow of the scaling variables @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "there are some trivial fixed points , namely :    h : :    : high - temperature fixed point @xmath21 l0 : :    : anisotropic low - temperature fixed point    @xmath22 l1 : :    : isotropic low - temperature fixed point    @xmath23 g : :    : gaussian fixed point @xmath24    the flow on the critical plane projected onto the @xmath19@xmath20 plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ rgth ] for ( a ) @xmath7 and ( b ) @xmath25 cases . when @xmath25 , there are stable and unstable chiral fixed points denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , beside the @xmath28 symmetric and the gaussian fixed points denoted by o and g , respectively .",
    "the two fixed points @xmath26 and @xmath27 approach as @xmath5 decreases , and annihilate each other at @xmath29 .    in the isotropic",
    "@xmath1 models , the correction - to - scaling term ( distance to the wilson - fisher fixed point ) rapidly converges to zero as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a renormalization factor and @xmath32 is the correction - to - scaling exponent .",
    "therefore the asymptotic critical behavior can be observed in finite systems with moderate size .",
    "however , when an anisotropic quartic term is included in the hamiltonian , it in general induces very slow rg flow along the anisotropy direction .",
    "the correction - to - scaling exponent at an anisotropic fixed point ( if it exists ) is usually of order @xmath33 or less , and extremely large system is needed to observe asymptotic critical behavior in the simulation of finite systems .",
    "even when there are no chiral fixed points and the rg flow eventually diverges , the rg flow in the intermediate region is very slow @xcite and it is very hard to observe asymptotic first - order behavior . thus , in the simulation of finite systems",
    ", it is crucial to check the convergence to the fixed point of the renormalized quartic coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 . now let us consider how to observe these renormalized coupling constants in the numerical simulations . in the continuum theory , they describe the behavior of renormalized field variables @xmath34 defined as follows : ( * x*;l)_|*k*|<1/l ( i * k * ) ( * k * ) d*k * , where @xmath35 is a cut - off length and @xmath36 denotes fourier component of the field @xmath37 . we denote by @xmath38 and @xmath39 the renormalized coupling constants of cut - off length @xmath35 : the renormalization flow in fig .",
    "[ rgth ] is a trajectory of @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the critical plane when @xmath35 is increased .",
    "the renormalization behavior of these quantities may be well observed via their conjugate quantities , which are easier to observe in numerical simulations : ( ^2(*x*;l))^2 , [ ulc-0 ]    _ a^2(*x*;l ) _ b^2 ( * x*;l ) -(_a ( * x*;l ) _ b ( * x*;l))^2 [ vlc-0 ] .",
    "of course , these quantities are affected not only by @xmath38 and @xmath39 but also by other irrelevant scaling fields , such as coefficients of higher order terms like @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ". however , these irrelevant scaling fields rapidly vanishes ( faster than the leading correction - to - scaling term in the isotropic model , @xmath42 ) and their effects can be ignored after sufficient renormalization as long as @xmath38 and @xmath39 converge ( or diverge ) very slowly .",
    "note that the definition of the renormalized field @xmath34 needs scaling prefactor so that the coefficients such as @xmath38 and @xmath39 remain finite when @xmath35 goes to infinity .",
    "the following scaling scheme is simple and suitable for numerical simulations @xcite : ^(*x*;l ) . substituting @xmath34 by @xmath43 , equation ( [ ulc-0 ] ) and ( [ vlc-0 ] ) lead as follows : , [ ulc ]    [ vlc ] .",
    "basically , in the present work , we observe these quantities in the numerical simulations of finite lattice version of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - c ] ) defined as follows :    h = k n 2 _ < ij > ( ( i)-(j))^2 + r_i ( i)^2 + u _ i ( ( i)^2 ) ^2 + v _ i , [ hamiltonian - l ] where @xmath44 is an @xmath13-component vector defined on the lattice site i of an @xmath45 cubic lattice with periodic boundary condition being imposed , the summation @xmath46 runs over all nearest neighbor pairs of the lattice site .",
    "we use a restriction @xmath47 so that the minimum of the hamiltonian takes place at @xmath48 to eliminate the ambiguity of the trivial rescaling of @xmath15 .",
    "actually we use the following parameterization : r= -2 , u= ( 1+a ) , v = 4 a where @xmath49 controls the strength of the anisotropy and @xmath50 controls the `` hardness '' of the spin the larger @xmath50 is , the smaller the fluctuation of @xmath51 is .",
    "a line @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath53 , on which instability of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - l ] ) occurs ; thus @xmath50 should be positive .    in the lattice models",
    ", renormalized field corresponds to block spin variables .",
    "for example , consider a block spin variable @xmath54 defined on a block of @xmath55 spins in an @xmath56 lattice model .",
    "one can calculate the quantities ( [ ulc ] ) and ( [ vlc ] ) using @xmath54 , which we denote by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , and check the convergence or divergence of the renormalization flow . in the conventional mcrg scheme @xcite , one calculates ( [ ulc ] ) and ( [ vlc ] ) for fixed value of @xmath59 and increasing value of @xmath31 .",
    "note that , after the  renormalization  by the block spin transformation , the number of spins , @xmath60 , decreases and the hamiltonian does not stay in the same hamiltonian space , unlike the continuum case . therefore the number of block spins must be sufficiently large , i.e. @xmath61 , so that ( [ ulc ] ) and ( [ vlc ] ) take the same value at the fixed point for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "the present author proposed another scheme @xcite , in which the ratio @xmath62 is fixed and both @xmath59 and @xmath31 are increased .",
    "let us denote a renormalized hamiltonian which contains @xmath63 block spins by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 are the renormalized coefficients of terms which correspond to that in the original hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - l ] ) , and @xmath66 denote set of coefficients of higher order irrelevant terms such as @xmath40 , which is not included in the original hamiltonian .",
    "now consider the behavior of @xmath67 and @xmath68 : the behavior of both quantities are described by a renormalized hamiltonian which contains only 1 spin , but with different coefficients . here , @xmath68 is a renormalized spin , obtained by applying real - space renormalization of factor-@xmath69 to the original spins .",
    "let us regard this factor-@xmath69 renormalization as two successive renormalizations , namely factor-@xmath70 renormalization at first and then factor-@xmath59 renormalization .",
    "accordingly , the original hamiltonian @xmath71 is at first renormalized to @xmath72 , then again renormalized to @xmath73 .",
    "if the starting hamiltonian is at a fixed point and @xmath59 is sufficiently large , coefficients before and after the factor-@xmath70 renormalization should remain unchanged except for the higher order coefficients @xmath74 @xcite . at this stage , @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "can be calculated ( in other words , factor-@xmath59 renormalization ) from @xmath72 , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are calculated from @xmath79 .",
    "since the coefficients of these two hamiltonians are the same ( except the irrelevant ones ) , @xmath80 and @xmath81 should be satisfied , where @xmath82 denotes correction - to - scaling exponent of the higher order terms such as @xmath40 . the so - called `` phenomenological renormalization group method '' @xcite uses this property to locate the critical point .",
    "when the hamiltonian is not at a fixed point , the coefficients before and after the first factor-@xmath70 renormalization differ : they moves along the renormalization flow .",
    "this difference is reflected by @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; if the renormalization flow slowly converges to some fixed point , @xmath77 and @xmath78 slowly converge to some fixed value , while when the phase transition is of first - order and the renormalization flow diverges , so do @xmath77 and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "we will henceforth denote these quantities simply by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and investigate their behavior at the critical point when @xmath59 is increased . here",
    "their explicit form is written down for the readers convenience : u_l= ( ^2)^2 ^2 ^2 [ ul ] , v_l= _ a^2 _ b^2 -(_a _ b)^2 ^2 ^2 [ vl ] , where @xmath85 . in the past numerical studies in which only a specific model was investigated , the only way to reach the final fixed point ( if it exists ) or to observe asymptotic first - order behavior was to simulate extremely large systems , and it was impossible in general . in the present work , we investigate various hamiltonians and scan the hamiltonian space in search of fixed points .",
    "this method allows us to determine the asymptotic critical behavior by simulations of moderately large systems .",
    "note that , in the theoretical works one can concentrate on the rg flow on the critical plane on which inverse susceptibility vanishes , while in the numerical works one must determine the critical point from the numerical data . for this purpose",
    "we use a quantity which corresponds to the following quantity in the continuum theory : = l^2 .    in the lattice models",
    ", the above quantity corresponds to the normalized correlation between two adjacent block spins .",
    "actually we observe the following quantity : c_l= ( * k*_1)(-*k*_1 ) ^2 [ cl ] , where @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ rgmc0 ] depicts the rg flow in @xmath83@xmath84@xmath88 space : a number of trivial fixed points , namely , high - temperature fixed point @xmath89 , isotropic low - temperature fixed point @xmath90 , and anisotropic low - temperature fixed point @xmath91 are denoted by h , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively . beside these points , there are some trivial manifolds : when the probability distribution of the order parameter @xmath94 is isotropic , a relation @xmath95 is satisfied , while in the strong anisotropy limit where @xmath96 and @xmath97 hold , @xmath98 is satisfied . at the gaussian fixed point ,",
    "the behavior of the finite system is governed by the zero - mode @xcite , therefore the gaussian fixed point lies on the @xmath99 plane . the rg flow on the critical plane , projected onto the @xmath83@xmath84 plane , is shown in fig .",
    "[ rgmc ] for ( a ) @xmath7 and ( b ) @xmath25 cases . in both cases ,",
    "the rg flow along the ( approximately ) horizontal direction rapidly converges , while along the ( approximately ) vertical direction the flow is expected to slowly converge / diverge .    to obtain the rg flow on the critical plane",
    ", we investigate the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - l ] ) for various values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , tuning @xmath14 so that @xmath100 is satisfied and observe the difference between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it should be noted that the above definition of critical plane induces systematic deviation .",
    "for example , consider the rg flow of the isotropic @xmath1 model ( set @xmath103 in ( [ hamiltonian - l ] ) ) .",
    "the flow of @xmath104 near the wilson - fisher fixed point is depicted in fig .",
    "[ rg - phi4 ] ( a ) @xcite .",
    "if one define the critical point by @xmath105 , the flow of @xmath83 becomes the one shown in fig .",
    "[ rg - phi4](b ) , thus the arrow tends to `` overshoot '' the rg fixed point .",
    "however , the direction of the flow can be correctly estimated , and the systematic error vanishes as one approaches the fixed point .",
    "we also observe the rg flow of the following sta model : h =- k _ < ij > j_ij , where @xmath106 denotes a two - component ( xy ) or three - component ( heisenberg ) vector spin with @xmath107 defined on the lattice site @xmath108 of the stacked triangular lattice .",
    "we set @xmath109 ( antiferromagnetic ) for intra - plane nearest neighbor pairs , @xmath110 ( ferromagnetic ) for inter - plane nearest neighbor pairs , and @xmath111 otherwise , so that the fourier transform of @xmath112 near the antiferromagnetic mode @xcite @xmath113 becomes isotropic in the @xmath114-space , i.e. @xmath115 .",
    "note that the critical values of quantities such as @xmath116 and @xmath88 do not depend on the microscopic lattice structure , but _ do _ depend on the macroscopic lattice structure such as boundary conditions and aspect ratios @xcite .",
    "therefore we use rectangular system which contains @xmath117 spins ( see fig .",
    "[ tri8 ] ) , imposing periodic boundary condition for all three directions .",
    "the aspect ratio then becomes @xmath118 .",

    "but the finiteness of the easy - plane spin anisotropy of the actual materials will weaken the transition compared to the sta - xy model simulated in the present work , in which the easy - plane anisotropy is infinitely strong .",
    "we have also investigated the rg flow the @xmath0component chiral @xmath1 model numerically and have found that there are no chiral fixed points in @xmath3 and @xmath9 cases , and we conclude that the sta - heisenberg model also undergoes first - order transition . by a rough estimate , we expect that the sta - heisenberg model exhibits strong first - order behavior when the size is larger than @xmath200 . for @xmath147 case , we have found the chiral fixed points , thus the value of @xmath6 is estimated as @xmath201 . further study to determine the precise value of @xmath6 may be of some interest , because such a study will serve to test the accuracy of field theoretical techniques .",
