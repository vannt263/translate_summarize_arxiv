    "other than the intervening systems , all absorption lines have a component at @xmath18 , the highest redshift absorption system we observe , which we take to be the redshift of the host galaxy .",
    "if the other 3 systems are a type of outflow ( we do not rule out the possibility that the 0 velocity system is associated with the grb progenitor rather than the host galaxy , but see section 4.2 ) , their observed velocities would be approximately 570 , 2400 and 2800  km  s@xmath0 ( as reported in salamanca  2002 ) .",
    "the lines at we observe at 11901197  could be either h ly@xmath11 at 5500 km  s@xmath0 , intervening ly@xmath11 forest lines or siii at 0 km  s@xmath0 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "in the former case , we might expect to see civ or siiv at this velocity as well , which we do not ; in the latter case , the stronger siii @xmath201260 line should also be seen , but it is not . we conclude that the nature of the lines at 11901197  is uncertain , though most likely ly@xmath11 forest lines , so we claim no h at velocities above 3000 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we find no significant variability in equivalent width ( ew , within the 2@xmath21 errors ) between the absorption features common to 2 or more epochs , with the exception of alii @xmath201670 at @xmath22 = 2.327 which we were unable to clearly detect in the 2nd and 3rd epochs .",
    "fixing the position of alii to that found at epoch 1 allowed us to fit a line there , and the resulting ew is inconsistent with that at epoch 1 within the 2@xmath21 errors .",
    "the alii line is also detected in several other spectra of this afterglow ( mller  2002 ; matheson  2003 ; mirabal  2003 ; schaefer  2003 ; fiore  2004 ) taken at times both before ( in the case of the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope ( not ) data ) and after our 2nd epoch wht spectra , and in each case the measured ew is consistent with what we measure in the epoch 1 wht data .",
    "the discrepancy may be due to imperfect cosmic ray / bad column removal at epoch 2 , and/or there may be moderate variability in this line .",
    "feii @xmath202344 is another low ionization line which is not detected in all optical spectra of grb021004 , though we do find it in the first 2 epochs presented here .",
    "the apparent variability of this line is largely due to the presence of a strong skyline near that position .",
    "the lack of significant variability in the strong lines indicates that the absorbing material in our line - of - sight remains in front of the afterglow throughout the @xmath5 6 days spanned by our spectra .",
    "the ews we measure are consistent with those of corresponding lines or line complexes reported by mller  ( 2002 ) , matheson  ( 2003 ) , mirabal  ( 2003 ) and fiore  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the resolution of these spectra are such that we are not resolving every component of each line blend  the line complex at the host galaxy redshift is resolved into 3 components in the vlt uves spectrum @xcite . unfortunately the calibration uncertainties in our late - time spectrum are too large to detect the colour change blueward of ly@xmath11 of @xmath23 magnitudes claimed by matheson  ( 2003 ) and schaefer  ( 2003 ) and supported by photometric observations @xcite , but not found in the hst observations of fynbo  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we clearly detect the host galaxy ism through its emission in hydrogen ly@xmath11 . taking the host galaxy redshift to be @xmath18",
    ", the ly@xmath11 emission line centre then appears redshifted , by an amount that is somewhat different between various authors .",
    "however , as it lies right on the edge of the ly@xmath11 absorption complex , which probably eats into the emission line , its central wavelength will depend on the resolution of the spectrum , so this effect is not surprising . within the resolution of these spectra ( a few hundred km s@xmath0 ) ,",
    "its velocity is in fact consistent with zero .",
    "the ly@xmath11 emission line strength is difficult to estimate due to the line blending .",
    "however , by fitting in isolation the part of the line observed above the continuum level , we can measure a lower limit to the flux : + f@xmath24 erg @xmath25 s@xmath0 , f@xmath26 erg @xmath25 s@xmath0 .",
    "these lower limits are consistent within the quoted 1@xmath21 errors , suggesting that both the emission line and the blended absorption line component at the host redshift show no variability , and are consistent with the value measured in not data of this source @xcite .",
    "in epoch 3 we obtain f@xmath27 erg @xmath25 s@xmath0 , with a large error of @xmath5 56 per cent .    following the method described in fynbo  ( 2004 , and references therein )",
    "we calculate a star formation rate ( sfr ) using the ly@xmath11 emission line flux measured in the wht data .",
    "we find a lower limit for the sfr of 6  yr@xmath0 , with average values of 10 and 7  yr@xmath0 at epochs 1 and 2 respectively , consistent with estimates based on keck and hst data of this afterglow ( djorgovski  2002 ; fynbo  2004 ) .",
    "our estimate assumes a cosmology with h@xmath28 = 70  km  s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 , @xmath29 = 0.3 and @xmath30 = 0.7 .    from these data",
    "we can obtain only a lower limit for the column density of hi of @xmath31 @xmath25 , by comparing the observed ews of each line to their theoretical curves of growth .",
    "this poor constraint is because the hi lines are close to or at saturation , they are all heavily blended and can not be well modelled .",
    "the column of neutral hydrogen is in fact much larger : @xmath32 ( @xmath25 ) @xmath33 ( mller  2002 ; fynbo  2004 ) . from the unsaturated lines of siiv and civ ( those at the 2 lowest redshifts and part of the outflow ) we measure columns of @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "respectively , where @xmath36 is given in @xmath25 , in line with previous estimates ( schaefer  2003 civ only ; fiore  2004 ) .",
    "the spectra we have taken provide information on material whose distance from the explosion centre covers a wide range . no material can be closer than the emitting surface ( the blast wave ) at the time of the first spectrum , which is about @xmath37  cm .",
    "some lines are from intervening galaxies very far from the host at @xmath2 and @xmath38 , and yet others are from the host itself at @xmath18 .",
    "we interpret the low - ionization absorption lines and the narrow ly@xmath11 emission line around @xmath39 as coming from within the host , but many parsecs from the explosion so that the absorbing material was unaffected by the explosion or by the grb progenitor .",
    "the blueshifted lines we interpret as coming from the region affected by the explosion or the progenitor , which we shall term the ` high - velocity zone ' .",
    "the ly@xmath11 absorption could in principle come from either the high - velocity zone or the host , but given its velocity structure , identical to that of the high - ionization lines of siiv and civ , we shall interpret it as coming from the high - velocity zone .",
    "ly@xmath40 absorption has also been observed with components spanning approximately the same velocity range @xcite .",
    "note that this implies a very low column of hi in the host in front of the immediate star forming region of the grb progenitor , unlike other grb hosts observed to - date .",
    "we discuss these outflowing systems and their possible origins in turn below .",
    "there is a possibility that the ` outflow ' may just be several systems in the line of sight to the burst .",
    "this , however , seems highly unlikely to occur so close to the burst redshift ( see schaefer  2003 ; fiore  2004 ) and in addition to the @xmath2 and 1.60 systems . specifically , a number of ( proto-)galaxies within 3000  km  s@xmath0 of each other would constitute a nonlinearly collapsed overdensity that is very hard to get as early as @xmath41 in currently favoured cosmologies either in the hubble flow or within a galaxy cluster including the grb host .",
    "let us now consider a clumpy stellar wind environment for grb021004 .",
    "clumps of material may comprise the stellar wind ",
    "cherepashchuk ( 1990 ) suggested that up to 80 per cent of a wolf - rayet stars mass can be lost in clumps in the wind . in principle",
    "the lines we see could either be due to a wind with optical depth less than 1 absorbing a fraction of the light more or less uniformly throughout the wind material , or by a partial covering of the emitting surface by optically thick clouds . in the latter case",
    ", the spectrum should be the sum of a featureless continuum from regions uncovered by cloud , and a spectrum with saturated , flat - bottomed lines from the regions covered by clouds that are optically thick in the lines but thin in the continuum .",
    "this implies that the summed spectrum should have flat - bottomed lines whose flux level in the centre is non - zero , when viewed with high enough resolution spectroscopy . whilst our data do not allow us to address this distinction , the uves high resolution afterglow spectra of grb021004 ( fiore  2004 ; castro - tirado , in preparation ) show flat - bottomed , saturated lines with no flux in the centre , effectively ruling out a partial covering model .",
    "we now consider the exotic possibility that the high - velocity absorption features are from a number of supernova shells produced by an earlier stellar death in the same cluster that produced the progenitor of the grb .",
    "it is plausible that an unusually rich cluster ( e.g. the central cluster of the s dor complex in the large magellanic cloud , lmc ) would have produced a number of stellar explosions in the past myr , of which the supernova remnants are now expanded beyond the cluster core size , so that our line of sight to the next explosion will only pass through the approaching sides of the shells and thus give rise to blueshifted features .",
    "the hydrogen richness is explained in this case , since the ejecta could contain hydrogen , or sweep it up .",
    "the problem is that the velocities are low enough that supernova shells must have significantly decelerated .",
    "in so doing , they will shock and be heated to x - ray temperatures , which makes species like hi , siiv and civ rather unlikely to be present in those shells .",
    "the shell geometry has also been seen around wolf - rayet stars as shell nebulae .",
    "mirabal  ( 2003 ) demonstrated that optical absorption lines like those seen in grb021004 can be produced by a fragmented shell nebula , under very particular conditions .",
    "the shell nebula would need to have been located at a distance from the grb progenitor such that it received sufficient radiative acceleration from the burst to achieve the high velocities , but was not fully ionized by the grb flux .",
    "all things considered , we do not favour these options .",
    "the most natural explanation for the blueshifted absorption features is that they arise in a stellar wind .",
    "a 1/@xmath42 density profile is inferred from the light curve at very early times @xcite suggesting a stellar wind circumburst medium .",
    "a grb progenitor must be a massive , evolved star .",
    "the highest velocity system observed is an outflow of @xmath5 2800  km  s@xmath0 , which could be the terminal velocity of a stellar wind and in this case implies the star is a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star ( mirabal  2003 ; schaefer  2003 ) .",
    "such stars evolve to type ib supernovae and are characterised by large mass loss rates in high velocity , optically thick stellar winds .",
    "the 3 outflow velocities observed in this afterglow could correspond to the fast wr wind ( 2800  km  s@xmath0 ) , a slower wind from an earlier phase in the stellar lifetime ( 2400  km  s@xmath0 ) and the slow bubble moving into the ism or mixing of winds from different phases ( 570  km  s@xmath0 ) as shown in simulations of massive star evolution by van marle , langer & garca - segura ( 2005 ) .",
    "massive star winds are predicted to show a higher optical depth in the civ line than in the siiv line @xcite which seems to be true for these data .",
    "line - locking is a characteristic of wr wind spectra , since the winds are radiatively driven ( e.g. puls  1996 ) , and this appears to be present in the wht spectra @xcite , seen as an overlap of the civ doublet lines at the two highest redshifts .",
    "if , however , the only signature of the radiatively driven wr wind is the fastest absorption component , then line - locking would not be expected , and would be a coincidence in this case .",
    "there are two basic challenges to interpreting these lines as originating in the stellar wind .",
    "the first is that the species causing the lines must survive the initial blast of uv to gamma rays without becoming fully ionized .",
    "the distance out to which the material might be fully ionized can be estimated in two different ways , depending on the recombination time - scale .",
    "if the recombination time is short compared to the 100  s duration of the ionizing flash @xcite , we can use ionization equilibrium as characterised by the ionization parameter @xmath43 .",
    "if on the other hand the recombination time is long , then a given atom with cross - section @xmath21 for ionization will simply absorb at least one ionizing photon : @xmath44 this is the appropriate limit to use since a rough calculation of the recombination time for hydrogen gives a time - scale of the order of 10@xmath45 years .",
    "this gives minimal distances for the survival of siiv , civ and hi of 5@xmath1010@xmath46 , 2@xmath1010@xmath47 and 9@xmath1010@xmath48 cm respectively ( using photoionization cross - sections and threshold energies from verner  1996 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "if we assume that these 3 species are co - located ( because they have the same velocity structure ) then the minimum distance out to which we could find them if they were ionized by the burst flux is far beyond the few pc radius of a typical stellar wind bubble .",
    "this excludes a stellar wind origin for these absorption lines if they are intercepted by the grb flux .",
    "the second challenge is the presence of hydrogen in the spectra with approximately the same velocity structure as siiv and civ , strongly suggesting that significant amounts of hydrogen are present in the stellar wind , with a column of neutral hydrogen @xmath5010@xmath51 @xmath25 .",
    "this is not usual for a wr wind . a wr star will once have been hydrogen - rich , and so the outer wind can have hydrogen , but its velocity structure will not match that of the later , hydrogen - deficient wind .",
    "wr stars in our own galaxy are hydrogen deficient and in most cases h is not detected at all . however in the smc a large fraction , if not all single wn - type wr stars ( nitrogen - rich wr stars ) show hydrogen in their spectra @xcite .",
    "this was unexpected given the lack of h in galactic wn - types , leading to the suggestion that the wn population in the smc is fundamentally different from that of our own galaxy .",
    "so in the smc , where the metallicity is low causing less severe mass loss and fewer wc - type ( carbon - rich ) wr stars , massive stars can remain h - rich in the wr phase .",
    "grb host galaxies are thought to be metal - poor like the smc , but the strength of civ and siiv and non - detection of nitrogen ( particularly niv , nv ) in the afterglow spectra of grb021004 is inconsistent with a wn - type wr star .",
    "in fact carbon produces the strongest absorption features , suggesting we are observing the wind of a wc - type wr star ( e.g. mirabal  2003 ; schaefer  2003 ) , thought to be the last evolutionary stage of the wr phase .",
    "on the other hand we do not detect ciii @xmath201247 which is strongly detected in samples of wc - types with e.g. fuse @xcite and iue @xcite .",
    "there is no significant variability in the absorption line ews between our very early spectrum at 0.49 days after burst , and those beginning 1.55 and 6.62 days after burst ( besides the alii line discussed in section 3.2 ) .",
    "the three epochs appear to be in different ` phases ' of the peculiar afterglow light curve ( fig .",
    "[ photometry ] ) .",
    "the jumps in the light curve at 0.81 and 2.53 days can not then be shells through which the afterglow light passes , because the same absorption is seen at all epochs . unless the shells are located very far from the star so that the afterglow never overtakes them , which then makes it difficult to produce the fast velocities we observe .",
    "21-cm measurements have shown hi shells around wr stars , e.g. wr 102 @xcite , but these have expansion velocities of @xmath5 50  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the galactic wr star wr 3 may also have an unusually high h content if it is a single star rather than in binary with an o star , but again only rather low velocities of up to 400  km  s@xmath0 are observed @xcite , never reaching the 24002900 km s@xmath0 velocities we observe .",
    "so , whilst a wr star is the obvious choice to explain the blue shifted , line - locked absorption complexes , this picture is difficult to reconcile with the large amount of neutral hydrogen observed , particularly at very high velocities .",
    "this conundrum leaves us with few options .",
    "either distant carbon - rich wr stars are very different to those in our own galaxy and are able to retain a large fraction of their hydrogen , or the hydrogen originates elsewhere  perhaps in a companion star wind .",
    "there is the possibility that we are seeing a wr star in a close binary with a hydrogen - rich main - sequence star . even for an o star companion ,",
    "the momentum loss rate @xmath52 of the wr star far exceeds that of the companion , and so the wind velocity structure at distances much greater than the binary separation will be dominated by the wr star .",
    "however , a few to 10 per cent of the mass will come from the companion and so is hydrogen rich .",
    "when mixed into the wr wind it can cause the observed phenomenon of h ly@xmath11 emission accompanying otherwise typical wr lines .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that a wr star is in a binary with an o star is still a debatable number .",
    "foellmi  ( 2003a ) give theoretical binary frequency lower limits for wr+o systems in the magellanic clouds of @xmath53 ( lmc ) and @xmath54 ( smc ) , assuming a mass loss - metallicity relation of @xmath55 and excluding rotation effects .",
    "they find , however , significantly lower observed fractions of 30 and 40 per cent respectively ( foellmi  2003a , b ) .",
    "various measured values point towards the conclusion that the binary frequency of wr stars is identical to that of their progenitors and independent of the metallicity .",
    "there is also the possibility that the wr star is in a binary with a less massive star that is providing the observed hydrogen .",
    "the probability of a wr star having a lower - mass companion ( perhaps 13 m@xmath56 ) is even less well known , since such low - mass , low - luminosity companions are hard to detect .",
    "the only evidence for the existence of such binaries is the population of soft x - ray transients in our galaxy , which consist of a black hole orbited by a low - mass star in a very tight orbit .",
    "their ancestors must have been wr stars with a low - mass main - sequence binary companion .",
    "it has been suggested that these systems produce a grb when the black hole forms @xcite .",
    "one necessary consequence of this h - admixing model is that probably only within some angle from the orbital plane of the binary will h be mixed into the outflowing wind . in the polar direction",
    "pure wr composition will dominate .",
    "this will constrain our viewing angle to the system to being not too far out of the orbital plane . for an o star , still having a relatively strong wind ,",
    "this is not severe , but for a low - mass star with a very weak wind , the system would have to be viewed at or close to edge - on .",
    "this is unlikely if , as predicted by the collapsar model , the jets emerge from the polar axis of the progenitor star .",
    "the ionization problem remains however , and it seems that in order to observe fast - moving species such as siiv and civ and even hi , one must be observing a region undisturbed by the gamma ray jet . in order to achieve this we suggest a structured jet geometry , with one narrow jet ( @xmath57 3@xmath58 ) and one slower , much wider jet of material which are both visible to us ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "in fact , the afterglow has a surface area , and so there are several lines - of - sight along which the light will reach us",
    ". gamma rays from the inner jet will ionize material in its path .",
    "but if the inner jet opening angle is small then there will also be a line - of - sight along which we see material unaffected by high energy radiation .",
    "we propose that there is a second wider cone of slower jet material surrounding the narrow gamma ray jet .",
    "this wide jet is also seen through the absorber , probably a fast stellar wind within 2 older more slowly moving wind phases , which produces the absorption lines we observe .",
    "the power law decay of afterglow light curves can be very smooth , as in the cases of grb020813 ( e.g. laursen & stanek 2003 ) and grb990510 ( e.g. stanek  1999 ) .",
    "but some show considerable deviations from this with many irregularities , as seen in grb011211 ( e.g. holland  2002 ) and grb030329 ( e.g. lipkin  2004 ) and this is the case for this burst ( fig [ photometry ] ) .",
    "the structured jet scenario we describe is consistent with the observed light curve of the afterglow of grb021004 ( van der horst , private communication ) .",
    "we also note that the general decay of the light curve may be adequately fit with other models including several energy injections @xcite , patchy shell models @xcite and density enhancements in the ism @xcite or in a wind @xcite .",
    "from the light curve alone we can not pinpoint the cause of the irregularities in the temporal decay .",
    "considering the light curve in combination with the spectra provides further constraints and leads us to prefer the structured jet idea , which can explain both types of observation and does not require the absorbers to be at a large distance from the progenitor to produce the absorption lines seen in our spectra .",
    "we have observed the optical afterglow of grb021004 spectroscopically at three epochs ranging from 0.49 to 6.62 days after the grb , when the emitting surface is of order @xmath37  cm away from the explosion centre .",
    "the most unique feature in the spectra is the fact that lines of hi , siiv and civ are observed at blueshifts of up to 2900  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "while no model explored by ourselves or earlier authors explains this phenomenon in a very simple manner , we find that by far the most plausible explanation is that these lines result in the fossil stellar wind of a highly evolved wolf - rayet star .",
    "it is unusual that hydrogen would be present in such a wind .",
    "this could be explained if wr stars do remain hydrogen - rich up to explosion at high redshift and/or low metallicity , or if a nearby companion star had enriched the wr wind with hydrogen . in any case ,",
    "our data seem to further enhance the case for the origin of grbs in the core collapse of very massive stars .",
    "ionization from the burst itself prevents the existence of hi , siiv and civ close to the afterglow surface where the fast stellar wind should dominate .",
    "a structured jet geometry is a promising explanation : the gamma rays emerge in a small opening angle leaving a wider cone of slower , less energetic material also along our line - of - sight .",
    "this wider jet does not fully ionize the material in its path , and can give rise to the absorption lines we observe .",
    "this model is able to explain both the spectral features and reproduce the light curve shape .",
    "we thank r. mclure for interrupting his observing run to take these wht data .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussions with c. dijkstra , m. franx , a. j. van der horst , a. de koter , a .-",
