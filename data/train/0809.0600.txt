    "this is because the geometry of the ray optics associated with the lens requires rays parallel to the lens axis to converge to the focus after refraction , while the destructive nature of photon detection implies the termination of the path . as another example , consider a mach - zehnder interferometer where the second beam - splitter is replaced by a detector : the two converging arms are then brought into overlap and detected in the overlap region , without being sent through , as would be the case in a conventional mach - zehnder set - up .",

    "for example , if alice detects her photon at @xmath157 , @xmath158 or @xmath159 , bob s photon is projected to a superposition of the parallel modes 2 and 5 , modes 1 and 4 , or modes 3 and 6 . since this can not reveal positional information about whether the particle originated at @xmath85 or @xmath160 , and hence reveals no which - way information about slit passage , therefore , _ in coincidence _ with a registration of her photon at a focal plane point , the idler exhibits a young s double - slit interference pattern @xcite .",

    "the modified innsbruck experiment is revisited here in order to clarify this issue in detail in the light of the discussions of the previous sections .",
    "this will help crystallize what is , and what is not , responsible for the claimed signaling effect . in ref .",

    "thus no interference pattern is found on bob s screen even in the coincidence counts.,width=642 ]    first we present a qualitative overview of the modified innsbruck experiment .",
    "the only material difference between the original innsbruck experiment and the modified version we propose here is that the latter contains a ` direction filter ' , consisting of two convex lenses of the same focal length @xmath37 , separated by distance @xmath197 .",
    "their shared focal plane is covered by an opaque screen , with a small aperture @xmath198 of diameter @xmath199 at their shared focus .",

    "if it is not satisfied strictly , the predicted signal is weaker but not entirely suppressed .",
    "the point is clarified further down .",
    "if alice makes no measurement , the idler remains entangled with the signal photon , which renders incoherent the beams coming through the upper and lower slits on bob s side , so that he will find no interference pattern on his screen .",
    "similarly , if she detects her photon in the imaging plane , she localizes bob s photon at his slit plane , and so , again , no interference pattern is seen . thus far , the proposed experiment the same effect as the innsbruck experiment .    on the other hand , if alice scans the focal plane and makes a detection , she remotely measures bob s corresponding photon s momentum and erases its path information , thereby ( non - selectively ) leaving it as a mixture of plane waves incident on the direction filter .",
    "however only the fraction that makes up the pure state comprising the horizontal modes passes through the filter .",
    "diffracting through the double - slit diaphragm , it produces a young s double slit interference pattern on bob s screen .",
    "those plane waves coincident with alice s detecting her photon away from focus @xmath157 are filtered out and do not reach bob s double slit assembly .",
    "it follows that an interference pattern will emerge in bob s _ singles counts _ , coinciding with alice s detection at @xmath157 or close to @xmath157 .",
    "thus alice can remotely prepare inequivalent ensembles of idlers , depending on whether or not she measures momentum on her photon . in principle , this constitutes a superluminal signal .",
    "quantitatively , the only difference between the innsbruck and the proposed experiment is that eq .",
    "( [ bobfjeld ] ) is replaced by an expression containing only horizontal modes . as an idealization ( to be relaxed below ) , assuming perfect filtering and low spreading of the wavepacket at the aperature , we have : @xmath205 where @xmath175 now represents the distance from the epr source to the upper / lower slit on bob s double slit diaphragm ( the length of the segment @xmath206 or @xmath207 ) ; @xmath178 ( resp . , @xmath179 ) is the distance from the upper ( resp . , lower ) slit to @xmath172 .",

    "it follows that bob s observed pattern in the singles counts conditioned on alice measuring in the imaging plane , @xmath211 , is also the same , i.e. , @xmath212 .",
    "our main result is the difference between the patterns @xmath211 and @xmath208 , which implies that alice can signal bob one bit of information across the spacelike interval connecting their measurement events , by choosing to measure her photon in the focal plane or not to measure . in practice",
    ", bob would need to include additional detectors to sample or scan the @xmath172-plane fast enough .",
    "this procedure can potentially form the basis for a superluminal quantum telegraph , bringing into sharp focus the tension between quantum nonlocality and special relativity .",
    "considering the far - reaching implications of a positive result to the experiment , we may pause to consider whether our analysis of so far can be correct , and in the chance ( however limited ) that it is how such a signal may ever arise , in view of the no - signaling theorem .",
    "it may be easy to dismiss a proof of putative superluminal communication as ` not even wrong ' , yet less easy to spot where the purported proof fails and to provide a mechanism for thwarting the signaling .",
    "for one , the prediction of the nonlocal signaling is based on a model that departs only slightly from our quantum optical model of section [ sec : sridom ] , which explains the original innsbruck experiment quite well . there have been various attempts at proving that quantum nonlocality somehow contravenes special relativity .",
    "the author has read some of their accounts , and it was not difficult to spot a hidden erroneous assumption that led to the alleged conflict with relativity .",
    "armed with this lesson , the present claim will be different in the following three ways :    * _ we individually discuss , in the following section , various possible objections to our claim , and demonstrate why each of them fails .",
    "_ by ruling out all the obvious mechanisms for thwarting the signaling , we are led to believe either ( a ) that there are erroneous but less obvious assumptions that have somehow gone into arriving at the superluminal signaling ( more likely ) , or ( b ) that there is new physics , associated with the signaling ( less likely ) . + either way , it is in the spirit of science that we must now rely on experiments to be the final arbiter on the question . if item ( a ) turns out to be the right scenario eventually , our present exercise could still be instructive in yielding new theoretical insights .",
    "for example , a proposal for superluminal communication based on light amplification was eventually understood to fail because it violates the no - cloning theorem , a principle that had not been discovered at the time of the proposal was made ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "_ we single out , in the following section , the key assumption responsible for the superluminality .",
    "_ this is shown to be alice s momentum measurement , which implements a non - complete measurement of the polynomial superluminal type .",
    "this makes clear exactly what is the non - standard element at stake , and further makes it easier for the reader to judge whether the proposal is wrong , not even wrong , or as we believe is the case worth testing experimentally . *",
    "_ we have furnished computation- and information - theoretic grounds for why superluminal gates could be possible .",
    "_ we have shown how no - signaling could be a nearly - universal - but - not - quite side effect of the computation theoretic properties of physical reality ; elsewhere @xcite , we show how the relativity principle could be a consequence of conservation of information .",
    "these ideas suggest that no - signaling is not an exact or fundamental law , but an indication of a deeper computational and informational layer underlying physical reality",
    ".    it would no doubt be surprising if such non - complete measurements , which have no place in standard quantum mechanics , turn out to exist . in the last section ,",
    "we clarify how they could possibly fit in with known physics .",
    "there we will argue that they arise owing to the potential fact that practically measurable quantities resulting from quantum field theory are not described by hermitian operators , at variance with a key axiom of orthodox quantum theory @xcite .",
    "in the section , we will consider a number of possible objections to our main result .",
    "it might at first be supposed that as the only difference between our set - up in figure [ fig : zei ] and the innsbruck experiment ( figure [ fig : zeiz ] ) , the direction filter must be responsible for the signaling , and that therefore , there must be some unphysical assumption in the way the filter is described to work .",
    "for example , it might be supposed that in a legitimate filter , the spreading caused by the aperture would wash out any information about alice s choice . yet , in the case of each objection , we will quantitatively demonstrate why there arises no physical mechanism to thwart the nonlocal signaling , and thus the objection fails .",
    "for instance , contrary to the above example claim , we will find that the mode - selection at the filter can be described as a local linear unitary ( and hence complete ) operation acting on the idler , and thus should not lead to any violation of no - signaling .",
    "the signaling arises from some action of alice , which we identify with her ` momentum ' measurement , and which we show to realize a noncomplete operation in the subspace of interest .",
    "it turns out that the filter only serves the practical purpose of exposing the signaling that would otherwise remain hidden in the averaged pattern that bob receives .",
    "these points are discussed in the following subsections .      in an actual experiment ,",
    "the conditions ( [ eq : sricond ] ) may not hold strictly , with narrow filtering leading to a diffractive spreading of bob s photon .",
    "it might appear that because the direction filter localizes the photon in momentum space , it would cause a complementary positional spread of the wavefunction , as a result of which bob should observe a fixed interference pattern always , no matter what alice does ( or does not ) .",
    "however , a closer examination shows that such a spreading only causes a reduction in the visibility and not a total washout of the pattern received by bob in the case of alice s focal plane measurement .",
    "thus , the spreading only lowers but does not eliminate the distinguishability between the two kinds of pattern that bob receives . a simple , quantitative explanation of this situation is discussed in the remaining part of this subsection .        the state ( [ spdc ] ) is now represented in a simple way as the unnormalized state @xmath224 where for simplicity the vacuum state , which does not contribute to the entanglement related effects , is omitted , and it is assumed that each mode contains at most one pair of entangled photons ( i.e. , no higher excitations of the light field ) .",
    "further because of the direction filter , it suffices to restrict our attention to the state @xmath225 the projection of @xmath226 onto @xmath227 , where @xmath106 is the subspace spanned by @xmath228 and @xmath229 , can be written as the kraus operators @xmath230 . within @xmath231",
    "these operators form a complete set since @xmath232 in the position basis does not nonlocally affect bob s reduced density operator in this subspace , which is proportional to @xmath233 .      a simple model of the action of the perfect direction filter is @xmath244 ) . here",
    "@xmath245 can be thought of as a state orthogonal to all @xmath147 s and other @xmath245 s , that removes the photon from the experiment , for example , by reflecting it out or by absorption at the filter .",
    "it suffices for our purpose to note that @xmath246 can be described as a local , standard ( linear , unitary and hence complete ) operation . since the structure of qm guarantees that such an operation can not lead to nonlocal signaling ,",
    "the conclusion is that the superluminal signal , if it exists , must remain _ even if the the direction filter is absent_.    we will employ the notation @xmath247 . to see that the nonlocal signaling is implicit in the state modified by alice s actions even without the application of the filter , we note the following : if alice measures ` momentum ' on the state @xmath226 and detects a signal photon at @xmath157 , she projects the corresponding idler into the state @xmath248 .",
    "similarly , her detection of a photon at @xmath159 projects the idler into the state @xmath249 , and her detection at @xmath250 , projects the idler into the state @xmath251 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of the direction filter , alice s remote measurement of the idler s momentum leaves the idler in a ( assumed uniform for simplicity ) mixture given by @xmath252 her momentum measurement is non - complete , since the summation over the corresponding projectors ( r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srirhop ] ) ) is not the identity operation @xmath253 pertaining to the hilbert space spanned by six modes @xmath147 @xmath254 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if alice remotely measures the idler s position , she leaves the idler in the mixture @xmath255 here again , her position measurement is non - complete , reflected in the fact that the summation over the corresponding projectors ( r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srirhoq ] ) ) is not @xmath253 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath256 , we are led to conclude that the violation of no - signaling _ is already implicit in the innsbruck experiment_. yet , since bob measures in the @xmath172-basis rather than the ` mode ' basis , in the absence of a direction filter as is the case in the innsbruck experiment , bob s screen will not register any signal , for the following reason . in case of alice",
    "s focal plane measurement , the integrated diffraction - interference pattern corresponding to different outcomes will wash out any observable interference pattern . on the other hand , in case of alice s imaging plane measurement , bob s each detection comes from the photon s incoherent passage through one or the other slit , and hence again no interference pattern is produced on his screen .",
    "thus , measurement at bob s screen plane @xmath172 without a direction filter will render @xmath257 effectively indistinguishable from @xmath258 .",
    "the role played by the direction filter is to prevent modal averaging in case of alice s momentum measurement , by selecting one set of modes .",
    "the filter does not create , but only exposes , a superluminal effect that otherwise remains hidden .",
    "it is well known that path information ( or particle nature ) and interference ( or wave nature ) are mutually exclusive or complementary . in the two - photon case , this takes the form of mutual incompatibility of single- and two - particle interference @xcite , because entanglement can be used to monitor path information of the twin particle , and is thus equivalent to ` particle nature ' .",
    "one may thus consider single- and two - particle correlations as being related by a kind of complementarity relation that parallels wave- and particle - nature complementarity .",
    "a brief exposition of this idea is given in the following paragraph .",

    "we let @xmath269 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath2 . quantifying the degree of entanglement by concurrence",

    "we thus obtain a trade - off between coherence and entanglement given by @xmath271 , a manifestation of the complementarity between single - particle and two - particle interference .    in the context of the proposed experiment",
    ", this could raise the following purported objection to our proposed signaling scheme : as the experiment happens in the near - field regime , where two - particle correlations are strong , one would expect that bob should not find an interference pattern in his singles counts . yet , contrary to this expectation , eq .",
    "( [ ram ] ) implies that such an interference pattern does appear .",
    "the reason is that in the focal plane measurement , alice is able to erase her path information in the subspace @xmath272 , but , by virtue of the associated non - completeness , she does so in _ only one _ way , viz . via the non - complete operation @xmath273 associated with her measurment . if her measurement were _ complete _ , she would erase path information in more than one way , and the corresponding conditional single - particle interference patterns would mutually cancel each other in the singles count .",
    "this is clarified in the following section .",

    "( [ eq : srispdc ] ) .",
    "the measurement operator corresponding to her detection at @xmath157 is @xmath283 in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srif0 ] ) .",
    "one might consider that to make her measurement complete , @xmath284 should be complemented by @xmath285 which might be interpreted as the operator corresponding to alice s non - detection at @xmath157 . if alice s momentum measurement were given by the pair @xmath286 , clearly no superluminal signal occurs for the reason given above . here",
    "one might consider @xmath287 to the operator corresponding to alice s non - detection at @xmath157 .",
    "unfortunately , the operator @xmath287 in necessarily non - physical , which can be seen in several ways .",
    "let us consider what @xmath287 represents from a quantum optics ( second quantization ) perspective .",
    "converting from first quantization langauge , we see that it represents @xmath288 .",
    "but this does _ not _ correspond to the electric field operator at _ any _ point on alice s side , since these modes meet only at @xmath157 , and since @xmath85 and @xmath160 are equidistant from @xmath157 ( along optical rays ) , the form of the electric field operator at @xmath157 is @xmath289 , which is of course @xmath284 in the first quantization langauge .",
    "thus @xmath287 is not a valid measurement operator of alice in the current set - up .    in particular",
    ", @xmath287 is not the measurement operator that corresponds to her non - detection at @xmath157 . if alice does not detect her photon at the @xmath157 , then she would in principle detect them elsewhere on the focal plane ( points @xmath158 and @xmath159 in our present model of figure [ fig : zei ] ) ) . in our simplified 6-mode picture , they are given by the operators @xmath290 in view of eqs .",
    "( [ alicefjeldab ] ) and ( [ alicefjeldac ] ) .    but clearly @xmath291 .",
    "in fact , the two operators do nt even have the same support .",
    "thus @xmath287 does not correspond to non - detection at @xmath157 and could not be used to complete @xmath287.this strange state of affairs is a consequence of non - completeness as had been clarified in note - in - citation @xcite .",
    "in other words , alice s non - detection at @xmath157 does not give rise to a complementary interference pattern , but to a non - detection at bob s side , too .",
    "the physical realization of @xmath108 allows us to study the polynomiality of the family of @xmath108-like gates from a less abstract and more physical perspective .",
    "the gate @xmath292 acting on @xmath293 dimensional system defined on @xmath71 qubits , prepared initially in the state @xmath294 .",
    "the spatial part of the physical @xmath71-qubit system s matter wave is now split into two partial waves by an appropriate beam - splitter , and then refocused onto a path singularity .",
    "on the second partial wave , before the two partial waves reach the region of spatial overlap , an oracle operation is applied which in a single step inverts the sign of all the kets , except the ` marked ' state @xmath295 , yielding @xmath296 . according to the above prescription for non - complete detection ,",
    "the output at the path singularity should be @xmath297 , i.e. , an outcome @xmath295 observed with the exponentially low ( in terms of @xmath298 , the number of qubits used to realize the state ) probability of @xmath299 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that for the most part , with probability @xmath300 for large enough @xmath71 , no atoms are observed at the path singularity , whereas the solution state @xmath295 is observed with probability @xmath301 . here",
    "non - detection of atoms should be interpreted as suppression of spatial transfer of atoms from their source to the path singularity .",
    "this is reminiscent of coherent population trapping , where an atom in a ` dark state ' remains unexcited because two pathways to excitation destructively interfere @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the above oracle operation could be defined so that the marked state is a solution to sat , the measurement would have to be repeated exponentially large number of times to detect a possible ` yes ' outcome .",
    "alternatively , exponentially large number of atoms should be used to build up an answer signal of strength @xmath124 in polynomial time .",
    "either way , the physical situation is compatible with the wnhe assumption , but not with no - signaling .",
    "the implementation of non - complete measurement of modes of arbitrary polarization gives us further insight into the polynomiality of nature .",
    "it is not difficult to imagine a more complicated rule than plain vector addition for the interference of quantum wavefunctions ( say a renormalization following vector addition ) , which could have been used to boost the above signal , to solve sat in polynomial time .",
    "this would in fact implement the post - selection gate .",
    "however , it would have required ` nature to compute harder ' than believed to be possible with a turing machine or equivalent model of computation , in contradiction to the wnhe viewpoint that the universe is a polynomial place .",
    "considering the far - reaching implications of a positive result to our proposed experiment , we have to remain open to the possibility that there is an error somewhere in our analysis , possibly a hidden unwarranted assumption , the elimination of which would provide a mechanism to prevent the superluminal signaling . however , in support of our claim , it may be noted that our analysis of the modified innsbruck experiment is based on a model that works quite well in explaining the results of the original innsbruck experiment .",
    "this suggests that it would be difficult to prohibit the superluminal signal in the model of the modified experiment without also ending up proscribing two - particle correlations in the model for the innsbruck experiment .",
    "furthermore , we have ruled out in section [ sec : sriung ] all the ( so far as known to us ) obvious objections .",
    "hence we are led to believe that any erroneous assumption or application of physical principles , if it exists in our analysis , must be sufficiently subtle .",
    "therefore , it would still be instructive to perform our proposed experimental tests because , even if the tests yield a negative result , provided the outcome is unambiguous , we could re - examine our analysis confident of detecting an erroneous element that is otherwise not obvious . as in the earlier mentioned example of the no - cloning theorem , even this potentially negative result could carry new theoretical insights .",
    "on the other hand , in the surprising event the proposed experiment yields a positive outcome , a number of issues would clearly be brought up .",
    "foremost among them : the apparent violation of locality in standard , linear qm would now emerge as a real violation , and no - signaling would no longer be a universal condition .",
    "the issue of ` speed of quantum information ' @xcite would assume practical significance .    a putative positive outcome to either of the proposed experiment would also bolster the case for believing that the wnhe assumption is a basic principle of quantum physics , while undermining the case for no - signaling in qm .",
    "it would then follow that intractability , and by extension uncomputability , matter to physics in a fundamental way .",
    "this would suggest that physical reality is fundamentally computational in nature @xcite . with this abstraction",
    ", physical space would be regarded as a type of information , with physical separation no genuine obstacle to rapid communication in the way it seems to be when seen from the conventional perspective of causality in physics . on the other hand ,",
    "the barrier between polynomial - time and hard problems would be real",
    ". the physical existence of superluminal signals would thus not be as surprising as that of exponential gates .",
    "interestingly , polynomial superluminal operations exist even in classical computation .",
    "the random access machine ( ram ) model @xcite , a standard model in computer science wherein memory access takes exactly one time - step irrespective of the physical location of the memory element , illustrates this idea .",
    "rams are known to be polynomially equivalent to turing machines . at the least",
    ", wnhe could serve as an informal guide to issues in the foundations of qm , and perhaps even quantum gravity .    even granting that the noncomplete gate @xmath113 turns out to be physically valid and realizable",
    ", this brings us to another important issue : how would non - completeness fit in with the known mathematical structure of the quantum properties of particles and fields , and why , if true , should it have remained theoretically unnoticed so far inspite of its far - reaching consequences ?",
    "we venture that the answer has to do with the nature of and relationship between observables in qm on the one hand , and those in quantum optics , and more generally , in quantum field theory ( qft ) , on the other hand .",
    "it is frequently claimed that qft is just the standard rules of first quantization applied to classical fields , but this position can be criticized @xcite . for example , the relativistic effects of the integer - spin qft imply that the wavefunctions describing a fixed number of particles do not admit the usual probabilistic interpretation @xcite . again , fermionic fields do not really have a classical counterpart and do not represent quantum observables @xcite .",
    "in practice , measurable properties resulting from a qft are properties of particles of photons in quantum optics .",
    "particulate properties such as number , described by the number operator constructed from fields , or the momentum operator , which allows the reproduction of single - particle qm in momentum space , do not present a problem .",
    "the problem is the _ position _",
    "variable , which is considered to be a parameter , and not a hermitian operator , both in qft and single - particle relativistic qm , and yet relevant experiments measure particle positions .",
    "the experiment described in this work involve measurement of the positions of photons , as for example , alice s detection of photons at points on the imaging or focal plane , or bob s detection at points on the @xmath172-plane , respectively .",
    "there seems to be no way to derive from qft the experimentally confirmed born rule that the nonrelativistic wavefunction @xmath302 determines quantum probabilities @xmath303 of particle positions . in most practical situations ,",
    "this is really not a problem .",
    "the probabilities in the above experiment were computed according to standard quantum optical rules to determine the correlation functions at various orders @xcite , which serve as an effective wavefunction of the photon , as seen for example from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coinc ] ) . in qft",
    ", particle physics phenomenologists have developed intuitive rules to predict distributions of particle positions from scattering amplitudes in _ momentum _ space .    nevertheless , there is a problem in principle , and leads us to ask whether qft is a genuine quantum theory @xcite .",
    "if we accept that properties like position are valid observables in qm , the answer seems to be ` no ' .",
    "we see this again in the fact that the effective momentum and position observables that arise in the above experiment are not seen to be hermitian operators of standard qm ( cf . note @xcite ) .",
    "further , non - complete operations like @xmath242 , disallowed in qm , seem to appear in qft .",
    "this suggests that it is qm , and not qft , that is proved to be strictly non - signaling by the no - signaling theorem .",
    "since nonrelativistic qm and qft are presumably not two independent theories describing entirely different objects , but do describe the same particles in many situations , the relationship between observables in the two theories needs to be better understood .",
    "perhaps some quantum mechanical observables are a coarse - graining of qft ones , having wide but not universal validity .",
    "for example , alice s detection of a photon at a point in the focal plane was quantum mechanically understood to project the state of bob s photon into a one - dimensional subspace corresponding to a momentum eigenstate .",
    "quantum optically , however , this ` eigenstate ' is described as a superposition of a number of parallel , in - phase modes originating from different down - conversion events in the non - linear crystal , producing a coherent plane wave propagating in a particular direction .",
