    "strongly - coupled plasmas appear in exotic environments , such as dense astrophysical systems @xcite , matter irradiated with intense - laser fields @xcite , dusty plasmas of highly charged macroscopic particles @xcite , or non - neutral trapped ion plasmas @xcite that are laser - cooled until they freeze into a wigner crystal .",
    "ultracold plasmas are excellent systems in which to study strong - coupling achieved at relatively low - density in neutral systems where recombination , collective modes , and thermalization are all interesting things to explore .",

    "alkali atoms , alkaline - earth atoms , and metastable noble gas atoms are the most common atoms for these experiments because they posses electric - dipole allowed transitions at convenient laser wavelengths . the normal trapping configuration is called a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) ( fig.[energylevels ] and [ apparatus ] ) @xcite . in the experiments described here",

    "the number of trapped atoms is typically @xmath9 .",
    "these parameters can be adjusted . in particular , turning off the trap and allowing the cloud to expand yields larger samples with lower densities .    to form the plasma ,",

    "the density profiles , @xmath13 , follow the gaussian shape of the neutral atom cloud .",
    "because of the small electron - ion mass ratio , the electrons have an initial kinetic energy approximately equal to the difference between the photon energy and the ionization potential , typically between 1 and @xmath14k .",
    "the initial kinetic energy for the ions is close to the kinetic energy of neutral atoms in the mot .",
    "as we will discuss below , the resulting non - equilibrium plasma evolves rapidly .    to record an absorption image of the plasma , a collimated laser beam , tuned near resonance with the principle transition in the ions , illuminates the plasma and falls on an image intensified ccd camera .",

    "in order to understand the details of the image analysis , it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the plasma .",
    "the imaging probe is most sensitive to the ion dynamics , so we will concentrate on this topic .",
    "the behavior of electrons was studied experimentally in @xcite and theoretically in @xcite .",
    "ions are created with very little kinetic energy , but their initial spatially uncorrelated state possesses significant coulomb potential energy compared to the regular lattice that represents the ground state of the system @xcite .",
    "as ions equilibrate and correlations develop , the kinetic energy increases . this process is called disorder - induced heating , or correlation heating , and it has been discussed in many theoretical papers .",
    "early interest was generated by non - equilibrium plasmas created by fast - pulse laser irradiation of solid targets , for example @xcite , and the problem has been revisited in the context of ultracold neutral plasmas @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , one expects the ion temperature after equilibration to be on the order of the coulomb interaction energy between neighboring ions . a quantitative analysis @xcite , assuming complete initial disorder and incorporating the screening effects of the electrons , predicts an ion temperature of @xmath19 here , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the debye length .",

    "a system of particles with charge @xmath40 is strongly coupled when @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "@xmath42 for the systems studied here , so the electrons are not strongly coupled .",
    "this avoids excessive complications that arise when @xmath38 approaches or initially exceeds unity , such as screening of the ion interaction @xcite , and rapid collisional recombination and heating of the electrons @xcite , although we do see some signs of these effects , even in this regime .",
    "the ions typically equilibrate with @xmath43k , which gives @xmath44 , so the ions are strongly coupled .",
    "the time scale for disorder - induced heating is the inverse of the ion plasma oscillation frequency , @xmath45 , which is on the order of 100 nanoseconds .",
    "physically , this is the time for an ion to move about an interparticle spacing when accelerated by a typical coulomb force of @xmath46 .",
    "this time scale is also evident in molecular dynamics simulations of ion - ion thermalization @xcite .    for @xmath47 ,",
    "the ions have equilibrated and the thermal energy of the electrons begins to dominate the evolution of the plasma .",
    "electrons contained in the potential created by the ions exert a pressure on the ions that causes an outward radial acceleration .",

    "the experiments measured the final velocity that the ions acquired , which was approximately @xmath48 . with the imaging probe",
    ", we can now observe the expansion dynamics at much earlier times during the acceleration phase .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , a hydrodynamic model , which describes the plasma on length scales larger than @xmath49 , shows that the pressure of the electron gas drives the expansion through an average force per ion of @xmath50 where the electron and ion density distributions are @xmath51 .",
    "we assume thermal equilibrium for the electrons throughout the cloud @xcite .",
    "the force leads to an average radial expansion velocity for the ions , @xmath52 the velocity is correlated with position and increases linearly with time .",
    "this does not represent an increase in the random thermal velocity spread or temperature of the ions . due to the large mass difference ,",
    "thermalization of ions and electrons @xcite is slow and occurs on a millisecond time scale .    equation [ ionvelocity ] for the average ion velocity assumes a constant electron temperature . actually , as the plasma expands , electrons will cool .",
    "this can be thought of in terms of energy conservation or adiabatic expansion .",
    "it is possible to describe the expansion with a vlasov equation that includes the changing electron temperature . for an initial gaussian density distribution ,",
    "the equations can be solved analytically and the expansion preserves the gaussian shape with a @xmath53 density radius given by @xmath54t_{delay}^2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the experiments involving absorption imaging of the plasma , however , have concentrated on the first few microseconds of the expansion when the plasma size and electron temperature have not changed significantly .",

    "[ ionvelocity ] .",
    "the effects of the expansion are evident in the radial velocity that manifests itself in doppler broadening of the ion absorption spectrum .",

    "as we vary the detuning , we obtain absorption spectra as shown in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "the rest of the paper will deal with the relationship between spectra such as these and the underlying temperature distributions of the ions .",
    "the absorption cross section for ions in a region described by a temperature @xmath35 , is given by the voigt profile @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the doppler width , and @xmath67 is the effective lorentizian linewidth due to the natural linewidth of the transition , @xmath68 rad / s , and the laser linewidth , @xmath69 rad / s .",

    "this originates from conversion of coluomb potential energy into kinetic energy as the ions evolve from a completely disordered state to one with some degree of spatial correlations .",
    "this was predicted in @xcite , and observed in numerical simulations @xcite and the first experimental studies with optical imaging @xcite .",

    "the three curves coincide very well in the time axis , but show slight deviation in the temperature axis .",

    "electron screening is discussed in @xcite .    to quantitatively analyze the data in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] we must account for the effect of the inhomogeneous density distribution @xcite .",

    "if the effective ion temperature is measured for longer delay times , acceleration of the ions by the electron pressure also becomes important .",
    "the effect is small for the data presented here , but its effect can be modelled @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of the ions then becomes a sensitive probe of the electron temperature which evolves under the influence of recombination , continuum lowering , disorder - induced heating , and adiabatic expansion @xcite .    from the measured @xmath87 , @xmath29 , and density distribution , we calculate the average coulomb coupling constant for debye - screend ions , @xmath88 for all the data shown in figs .",

    "the region with lower density has lower @xmath87 , supporting our hypothesis of local thermal equilibrium , but the oscillation is the most striking observation .",
    "@xmath1 and initial @xmath76k . in ( b ) , we plot the visibility of the oscillation for the central probed region versus the averaged @xmath37 for this region for all our data taken at different conditions . from @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=384 ] +    intuitively , one can explain this phenomenon as an oscillation of each ion in its local potential energy well .",
    "a simple calculation implies that the time for an ion to move an interparticle distance , when accelerated from rest by a force of @xmath95 , varies as @xmath85 , and the observed oscillation occurs at @xmath96 .",
    "as expected from the density dependence of @xmath97 , the oscillation period is longer for the outer region where the average density is lower .",
    "this explains why averaging over the entire cloud obscures the oscillation ; the motion dephases because of the variation in @xmath97 .",
    "it is questionable whether the ion motion should be called an ion plasma oscillation or not , because there is probably no collective , or long range coherence to the motion .",
    "kinetic energy oscillations at @xmath96 have been observed in molecular dynamics simulations of equilibrating strongly - coupled systems @xcite .",
    "calculations @xcite also show oscillations in the velocity autocorrelation function in equilibrium strongly - coupled one - component plasmas . to our knowledge , this is the first experimental observation of the phenomenon . numerical results@xcite",
    "suggest that the damping time for the oscillations is approximately @xmath98 for @xmath99 , and that lower @xmath100 leads to faster damping . because our analysis still averages over the z - axis of the plasma , which introduces dephasing into the observed oscillations , it is difficult to comment on the damping of the oscillation .",

    "the absorption spectrum , after accounting for the inhomogeneous plasma density distribution , measures the average ion temperature .",
    "equilibration of the plasma shows the effect of disorder - induced heating .",

    "the ion kinetic energy also displays oscillations that are characteristic of equilibrating strongly coupled plasmas .",

    "some of the most interesting are investigating dynamics when the initial electron coulomb coupling parameter is large and recombination and disorder - induced electron heating are expected to dominate the plasma evolution .",
    "detailed examination of ion and electron thermalization at the border of the strongly coupled regime is also possible .",
    "quantitative study of the kinetic energy oscillations is also necessary in order to develop a better understanding of aspects of the phenomenon such as damping .",
