    "however on smaller scales the resummation inherent in our approach allows clpt to track the n - body results to smaller scales than lrt .",
    "the comparison with the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of the redshift - space correlation function is very similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : quad_matt ] ) .",
    "both lrt and clpt provide a better fit than linear theory to the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments at large scales , but all theories depart from the n - body results at larger scales than for the monopole .",
    "the level of agreement is worse for the hexadecapole , but that moment is also quite small .",
    "[ fig : halo_real ] compares the theories for biased tracers , in this case for halos in the range @xmath186 at @xmath187 though other results are qualitatively similar ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : halo_many ] ) .",
    "the situation is similar to that for the matter : linear theory provides a poor approximation at large scales , missing the smearing of the acoustic peak due to the motion of material .",
    "lrt tends to overshoot the n - body results at small scales , while clpt provides a good match down to @xmath188 .",
    "note that we considered two distinct sets of biasing parameters . in figs .",
    "[ fig : halo_real ] and [ fig : halo_red ] we allowed the `` renormalized '' bias parameters @xmath189 and @xmath190 to be adjusted independently , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo_many ] , we related the two using the peak - background split , as in @xcite .",
    "finally we compare the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift space correlation function of halos to the predictions of clpt in fig .",
    "[ fig : halo_red ] .",
    "the prediction of the monopole moment is in relatively good agreement with the n - body measurements , though the level of agreement at @xmath191mpc is clearly not as good as it was with the matter .",
    "the prediction for the quadrupole is much worse than it was for the matter .    on large scales the prediction for the quadrupole",
    "is dominated by the same terms as the matter and the term scaling as @xmath192 .",
    "the clpt prediction does not have as much power on small scales as the n - body results , which have more small - scale power compared to the large - scale power than was the case for the matter .",
    "the shortfall in power is shared by the terms which survive when @xmath193 and by the terms which scale as @xmath192 .",
    "the failure of our model to match the quadrupole moment on small and intermediate scales may be due to our assumption of local lagrangian bias . while this approximation has received some support from n - body simulations @xcite we also expect that terms involving e.g.  the tidal tensor , can become important for high mass halos @xcite .",
    "such terms are naturally quadrupolar in nature and may affect the predictions .",
    "we have presented a new formulation of lagrangian perturbation theory which allows accurate predictions of the low - multipole , real- and redshift - space correlation functions of the mass field and dark matter halos .",
    "our formulation , which we refer to as `` convolution lagrangian perturbation theory '' or clpt involves a non - perturbative resummation and indeed can be viewed as a partial resummation of the formalism of @xcite upon which we have relied heavily .",
    "a key difference between clpt and lrt or rpt is that we naturally recover the zeldovich approximation as the lowest order of our expansion for the matter correlation function .",
    "@xcite have recently emphasized the importance of not splitting the effects of bulk flows across orders in perturbation theory , and we find that clpt ( which does not make such a split ) does indeed provide better agreement with n - body results at small scales than lrt ( which does ) .",
    "clpt works best for the real - space clustering of the matter and halos and for the monopole of the redshift - space correlation functions .",
    "while the n - body results for the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments of the redshift - space correlation function for the matter is relatively well reproduced by clpt , those moments for the halo correlation function differ significantly from the clpt prediction .",
    "we suspect that this difference is due to a limitation in our bias prescription , in particular that our assumption of local lagrangian bias for halos is not sufficiently accurate",
    ". further work along these lines is clearly warranted .",
    "one possible extension of this work is to use the real - space correlation function from clpt in the gaussian streaming model ansatz of @xcite with @xmath194 and @xmath195 terms calibrated from n - body simulations or computed within the context of lpt .",
    "these terms can be computed in our formalism by generalizing our function @xmath115 ( eq .  [ eq : k ] ) to include a @xmath196 contribution and taking functional derivatives of @xmath115 .",
