    "collective electron states are widely used in the theory of metals  @xcite , while bulk dielectric and semiconductor materials are equally well modeled as a rigid network of covalent bonds incorporating lattice defects .",
    "success for classic models is mainly due to extensive use of translational symmetry , which is definitely not the case for nano - sized systems : nanoparticles are mostly imperfections with perfect regions rather than perfect crystals with imperfections .",
    "lattice termination is the main imperfection leading to the consideration of the collective surface - localized electron states problem .",
    "however , one should clearly distinguish collective states in a metal and in a dielectric material  collectivity does nt necessarily imply conductivity , and there is no contradiction between the `` bonding '' and `` collective '' terms .",
    "it s crucial to emphasize unambiguous meaning of the term `` collective '' we use in our paper : collective states in dielectric materials are bonding molecular orbitals , localized over several atomic cores . the fact that collective states despite their importance are rarely used in dielectric materials theory results in seemingly unresolvable issues like inability to describe the nature of the intrinsic spin found in the nanodiamond .",
    "b.  pate has summarized study of the electronic and atomic structure of the bulk diamond in his classic paper  @xcite . almost simultaneously the nanodiamond was discovered , and its practical applications attracted great attention  @xcite , leaving behind detailed investigation of the underlying structural and electronic aspects .",

    "collective electron states are vital part of the global perspective which interrelates consistently magnetism , surface conductivity and the set of nanodiamond experimental `` anomalies '' .",
    "the first theoretical investigation of the collective electron states in a bulk diamond was done by i.e.  tamm  @xcite .",
    "his calculations were based on the idea of electron confinement between periodic lattice potential and vacuum .",
    "we have followed tamm approach assuming that electron could be confined between vacuum and semi - periodic diamond ball kernel .",
    "j.  kouteck then investigated surface states of a one - dimensional crystal in connection with penetration of surface potential perturbation into the crystal and was the first to introduce the term `` subsurface states ''  @xcite .",

    "direct experimental evidence of the surface layer deformation in nanodiamond molecules follows from peels  @xcite , nmr  @xcite and auger  @xcite data and allows us to make the assumption about subsurface states existence in nanodiamond .",
    "we have concentrated our attempts on study of the collective electron states in nanodiamond in order to relate great amount of well - documented reliable experimental data with the _ ab initio _ computations of its electronic structure .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that it s vital to take nuclear movement explicitly into account in order to describe optical gap of diamondoids  @xcite",
    ". however , full - scale _ ab initio _ geometry optimization is still impossible for big diamondoids .",
    "the optimization procedure must be consistent with the experimentally observed deformation , so we introduce an approximate parametric non - uniform compression to the diamond ball model , which would allow us to skip the geometry optimization and to catch the qualitatively correct picture .    the problem of collective electron states localization in nanodiamond is considered , and qualitative explanation of the nature of the experimentally observed compression , the intrinsic unpaired spin and the peels pre - peak is proposed .",
    "orbital localization in nanodiamond was studied on model systems by exact numerical integration of schrdinger equation for one - particle model in one - dimensional kronig  penney potential and by _ ab initio _ computations of ground - state wavefunctions of small diamondoids .",

    "the structure of the compressed layer is usually and erroneously understood in terms of @xmath4-shell coating diamond core , despite the vast amount of experimental data showing inadequacy of this model .",
    "thus , nmr spectroscopy is unable to detect a @xmath4 phase signal  @xcite above the detection limit ; neither can x - ray powder diffraction .",
    "we conclude that the compressed layer is not to do with @xmath4-phase necessarily , so every atom in our model ( and in real best quality nanodiamond , actually ) is @xmath5-hybridized",

    "a quantitatively correct description of the compression is much more complex and , more importantly , would provide higher precision than we really need for demonstration purposes .      ground - state electronic structure computations for several small diamondoids @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 were performed at dft  r - b3lyp level of theory using the 6 - 31g(d , p ) basis set .",

    ", experimental data shows that unpaired electrons in nanodiamond are located in a subsurface layer and are delocalized over significant amount of carbon atoms .",
    "the unpaired electron is also completely unrelated to point defects and impurities .",

    "indeed , existence of stable uncompensated spin deep inside valence band in absence of external fields would leave free position for `` upper '' electrons and is impossible .",

    "analogy may be made with long conjugated @xmath27-electron systems where singlet instabilities of ground - state solutions are widely known  @xcite .",
    "fluctuational nature of intrinsic spin is probably the only suitable explanation which does not contradict experimental data , chemical reason , charge or high - spin states issues .",
    "there is no way to imagine classical radical spin1/2 state localized in the subsurface layer and being nevertheless stable .",
    "moreover , it seems that the number of intrinsic spins depends on the magnitude of applied field which probably magnifies the spin - density fluctuations in the subsurface orbitals .",

    "their observations are very similar to the nanodiamond case .",
    "consideration of these results allows us to propose similar explanation for paramagnetic center appearance under mechanical damage as a result of spin - density fluctuations in long collective molecular orbital localized on the damaged area .",
