    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "the force variation is obtained while gradually varying @xmath8 in small steps .",
    "we start by two ni slabs with no graphene layer in between .",
    "the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig1](c ) shows the variation of @xmath9 as @xmath8 is gradually decreased .",

    "the observed bistability or hysteresis manifests itself as strong adhesion and wear phenomena frequently observed in the dry sliding friction between two metal surfaces .",
    "similarly , the normal forces between two bare cu(111 ) and al(111 ) slabs are strong and show the behavior similar to fig .",

    "the maximum attractive force between ni(111 ) surfaces in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) is reduced to approximately 1/4 of that between bare surfaces .",
    "even if this graphene layer screens ( or decouples ) the interaction between two bare ni(111 ) surfaces and hence dramatically decreases the maximum attractive force between them , the hysteresis is still present between the approach and pull - off of the top surface , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) .",
    "the sudden variation of energy in the constant height sliding mode is also shown by inset .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the stick - slip motion , which usually plays the principal role in the dissipation of mechanical energy is still present .",
    "a pair of cu(111 ) and a pair of al(111 ) slabs having single graphene layers in between also exhibit similar behaviors , such as the reduced adhesion and bistability occurring in the course of the pushing and pulling - off the metal slabs .",
    "this is the first important theoretical prediction of our analysis and explains why graphite flakes can provide the lubrication of the sliding motion of two parallel metal surfaces .",
    "a number of interesting effects occur when the second graphene layer is inserted between ni slabs : owing to significant graphene - ni attraction each layer becomes stuck to one of the ni(111 ) surfaces .",
    "later we show that the binding between ni(111 ) surface and graphene layer is achieved mainly through the coupling between ni-@xmath0 and graphene-@xmath1 orbitals . under these circumstances the hysteresis is completely removed , since the jump - to - contact between graphene coated ni slabs are hindered .",

    "[ fig1](d ) is further reduced to @xmath280.12 ev /   per unit cell as shown in fig .",

    "consequently , the stick - slip regime comes to an end with the onset of the the continuous sliding regime , whereby the energy dissipation through the generation of non - equilibrium phonons is , in principle , completely suppressed .",
    "reminiscent of ni - aa - ni in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) , our results obtained from cu - aa - cu and al - aa - al indicate further weakening of the maximum attractive force upon the insertion of second graphene , where one graphene layer sticks to each metal surface .",
    "this is due to the fact that attractive metal - graphene interaction is stronger than the graphene - graphene interaction .",
    "physical mechanisms underlying these effects will be clarified in the forthcoming analysis .",
    "three graphene layers in ni - aba - ni shows slight decrease of maximum attractive force by @xmath280.04 ev /   per unitcell . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) , the maximum attractive force or the adhesion decreases gradually for @xmath292 and eventually saturates at a constant value of force @xmath280.08 ev /   per unitcell .",
    "this is in compliance with the short range nature of the orbital overlaps of different layers .",
    "in contrast , depending on the range and type of metal - graphene interaction , the maximum attractive force in cu - aba - cu and al - aba - al slightly increases as compared to cu - aa - cu and al - aa - al and remain practically unaltered for more graphene layers .",
    "we calculated the increase of the maximum attractive force upon increasing the number of graphene layers from @xmath3=2 to @xmath3=3 to be 0.13ev /   and 0.06 ev /   per unit cell for cu and al , respectively .",
    "the value of the maximum attractive force for @xmath30 keeps the same value .",
    "this is the marked difference between ni(111 ) and other metal surfaces like cu(111 ) and al(111 ) surfaces .      to clarify how graphene layers function as lubricant and also to investigate the effect of including more layers on the friction we examine the potential corrugation in the course of the sliding of the layers under constant pressure .",
    "to this end , we first calculate the optimized total energies @xmath31 , when the topmost ni layer is displaced and kept fixed at various lateral @xmath32-position and vertical separation @xmath8 relative to the bottommost layer ( see fig .  [ fig1](a)).@xcite these calculations are performed in a 3d grid of @xmath33 .",
    "the intervals between the data points were taken to be @xmath28 0.2     in the lateral @xmath32-plane and 0.2     in the perpendicular direction , @xmath8 , which are then made finer down to @xmath28 0.05     by spline interpolation .",
    "we also generate @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath9 matrices from the gradient of the total energy @xmath36 , which are found to be consistent with the forces calculated from the hellmann - feynman forces on fixed atoms of outermost planes .",
    "we then retrieve @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponding to a given @xmath9 ( normal pressure ) at each @xmath32 in the unit cell and generate the profiles of the potential corrugation from @xmath37 , where the minimum of total energy is set to zero .",

    "[ ] . on the other hand , the intrinsic stiffness of the present case , which is related to the interaction between ni and graphene layers is also substantially lower ( @xmath38  ev / @xmath39 ) compared to the intrinsic stiffness of those honeycomb structures.@xcite the lower intrinsic stiffness accompanied by low potential corrugation curvature results in a frictional figure of merit of @xmath28  10 , at constant pressure of 7  gpa , which is enough to keep the system in the continuous sliding regime . comparing the profiles of the potential corrugation of ni - aa - ni and aa structures , one can see how the interaction between graphene layers is affected by their interaction with ni surfaces .",
    "the effect of distortion presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) is reflected to the potential corrugation of ni - aa - ni , since its symmetry is changed from hexagonal to rectangular .    to set a measure for the _ corrugation strength _",
    "we first derive the path on which the upper slab would slide if it was pulled along @xmath24-axis .",
    "this path is shown by dashed lines in fig .",

    "we note that in the sliding of ni(111 ) slabs having @xmath3 graphene layers the dissipation of energy through non - equilibrium phonons generated by sudden processes is hindered for @xmath41 and hence @xmath42 vanishes .",
    "this , however , does not precludes energy dissipation through other mechanisms . with a premise that the maximum of the energy to be dissipated by any mechanism should not exceed @xmath43 ( i.e the integral of all positive work done during sliding of one slab over one unit cell shown by the green shaded region in fig .",

    "[ fig2](c ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] presents crucial trends related with the corrugation strength @xmath26 .",
    "as expected , @xmath26 increases with increasing normal force and is higher in structures composed of only graphene layers ( like aba ) compared to the ones having ni slabs ( like ni - aba - ni ) .",
    "this effect is mirrored in the repulsive interaction of graphene layers in the presence and absence of ni slabs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "namely , for a given width of graphene layers , ni - aba - ni is exerted by a normal loading force , which is smaller than that exerts on aba without supporting ni slabs .",
    "this situation presents a qualitative explanation why the corrugation strength calculated for ni - aba - ni is smaller than that calculated for aba in fig .",

    "this variation of the corrugation strength is in compliance with the nature of short range chemical interaction between ni(111 ) and graphene layers",
    ". stated differently , the exponentially decaying overlap between ni-@xmath0 and graphene-@xmath1 orbitals reflects to the variation of @xmath26 with @xmath3 . even if this trend illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) is seemingly reminiscent of the experimental observations related with the sliding friction between tip and graphene layers,@xcite the system at hand is very different and heralds another important effect .",
    "these trends can be explained by the effects of ni slabs on the electronic structure of graphene layers .",
    "the self - consistent difference charge density @xmath45 , is obtained by subtracting the charge density of aba structure and two ni(111 ) slabs from that of ni - abc - ni structure .",
    "the isosurfaces of @xmath45 and the variation of its value averaged over @xmath32-planes parallel to graphene layers ( called linear density ) are presented in fig .",
    "the major charge transfer takes place between ni and graphene layers attached to each other as seen in the top and middle panels of fig .",

    "therefore , in comparison with graphene deposited sio@xmath2 substrate@xcite the reducing of adhesion and the lowering of friction coefficient between ni(111 ) surfaces coated with single layer graphenes are much pronounced and graphene coating of ni(111 ) surfaces are more durable .",
    "al.__@xcite , who attained the highest durability and lowest friction coefficient in the sliding of sio@xmath2 lens on the as - grown graphene on ni corroborates our predictions .",
    "additionally , in the present theoretical work the interesting variation of adhesion and friction with @xmath3 are revealed by presenting all underlying physical and chemical interaction obtained from first - principles calculations .",
    "next , we address the question whether the static treatment of sliding friction , where dynamic conditions are neglected is appropriate .",
    "the criterion for the frictional figures of merit developed earlier theoretically@xcite and the relevant experimental background@xcite is quite general and is independent of dynamical conditions .",
    "the sudden processes generating non - equilibrium dynamical events ceases if a proper figure of merit is attained . as demonstrated above the figure of merit of ni - ab .. -ni structures approximately five times larger than the critical value .",
    "nonetheless , even if the stick - slip behavior disappears and the relative motion proceeds in the continuous sliding regime , our analysis considers the dissipation of maximum amount of energy by other mechanisms and hence requires that the integral of all positive work done in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is dissipated .",
    "this requirement makes our analysis more stringent and our conclusions more reliable than those can be obtained by considering only the dynamical effects at room temperature .",
    "thus , our conclusions are not affected because the dynamical effects or stochastic defects of real surfaces could not be simulated using first - principles methods .    .",
    "the bottom panel has isovalue one order of magnitude smaller than that of the top panel .",
    "linear ( or planar averaged ) @xmath45 varying along @xmath6-axis is given in the middle panel with numerals indicating specific regions .",
    "the normal pressure is @xmath28  6  gpa .",
    "yellow ( blue ) isosurface plots correspond to the charge density accumulation ( depletion ) . for the definition of difference charge density @xmath45 see the tex.,width=321 ]",
    "in conclusion , even if the strong interaction between the sliding surfaces of ni(111 ) is dramatically reduced by a single layer graphene placed in between , the bistability between approach and pull - off remains . also the stick - slip motion still exists and continues to dissipates significant amount of mechanical energy .",
    "the stick - slip motion and hence the generation non - equilibrium phonons are eliminated with the onset of continuous sliding , once each of metal surfaces in relative motion is coated by a single graphene layer .",
    "this is attributed to substantial interaction between ni surface and graphene through complex charge exchange causing to the reduction of the chemical interaction between graphene layers and hence to the decrease of the corrugation strength .",
    "the corrugation strength continues to decrease gradually with increasing graphene layer and eventually saturates at a small value . in the absence of metal slabs",
    "each coated by a graphene layer , the corrugation strength is relatively higher and practically independent of the number of graphene layers .",
    "our results demonstrate that graphene attached to sliding surfaces operate as superlubricant .",
    "one expects to achieve similar lubrication effect but in lesser degree by placing graphene flakes between sliding or rolling ni(111 ) surfaces .",
    "the interaction between ni(111 ) and graphene investigated in this study appears to be important not only for the growth of pristine graphene or for the protection from oxidation , but also for achieving the nearly frictionless friction .",
    "easy growth of graphene on ni(111 ) surfaces makes ni also an attractive substrate for nanotribology applications .",
    "finally , we note that the first - principles calculations of potential corrugations calculated in the constant force mode are achieved by optimizing atomic structure .",
    "this way , the elastic deformations of sliding surfaces under perpendicular loading force are taken into account .",
    "we believe that this important feature of the present method will be used in future studies dealing with the development of lubricant single layer materials .",
    "this work is supported by tubitak through grant no:108t234 also by efs eurocore programme fanas and the academy of sciences of turkey(tuba ) .",
    "all computational resources have been provided by tubitak ulakbim , high performance and grid computing center ( tr - grid e - infrastructure ) ."
