    "the occurrence of turbulent power law spectra after the saturation of chromo - weibel instabilities has been established by several authors  @xcite . however , the value of the spectral index characterising these spectra is still under debate .",
    "+ we investigate this question in two ways  @xcite : firstly , we carry out a perturbative , analytical calculation for the uv- part of the spectrum similarly as in  @xcite .",
    "this yields a spectral index @xmath0 in the equal - time correlation function of the gauge fields .",
    "subsequently , we run classical - statistical numerical simulations starting from nonequilibrium initial conditions .",
    "we find that the spectral index from the numerical solution agrees with the result from the analytical computation .",
    "our interest in this work focuses on the anti - commutator expectation value @xmath1 of the gauge field .",
    "it appears in a decomposition of the full propagator according to @xmath2 where @xmath3 \\ , \\rangle $ ] is the spectral function .",
    "the nonlocal part of the self - energy can be decomposed in a similar way as the propagator  @xcite , @xmath4 with ( anti-)symmetric @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "all these objects are diagonal in the colour indices and thus we will drop the latter in what follows .    the goal of this work is to study fixed - point solutions .",
    "these are invariant under time translations and we additionally assume spatial translation invariance as well .",
    "this implies that all correlation functions and self - energies only depend on the displacement @xmath7 , that is @xmath8 , and analogously for the other objects .",
    "a solution with these properties satisfies the following identity in fourier space  @xcite : @xmath9 in order to find an analytical solution we will later integrate this equation over @xmath10 .",
    "now we make the following scaling ansatz for the symmetric and anti - symmetric correlation functions : @xmath11 the partial fourier transform of such a solution for @xmath12 possesses the property @xmath13    in a perturbative calculation the dominant contribution to the self - energies in the uv stems from the diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - loop - diagram ] . using the perturbative three- vertex for the su(2)- gauge theory we can write the self - energies as @xmath14 \\bigl [ \\ , g^{\\nu \\rho}(p - k)^{\\sigma } + g^{\\rho \\sigma}(k - q)^{\\nu } + g^{\\sigma \\nu } ( q - p)^{\\rho }   \\ , \\bigr ] \\\\ { \\pi^{\\ ; \\mu \\nu}_{(\\rho ) \\ , } } ( p ) & = + g^2 \\int { \\frac{d^{4 } k}{(2 \\pi)^{4 } } }   \\int { \\frac{d^{4 } q}{(2 \\pi)^{4 } } } \\ , \\delta(p +",

    "integrating over the spatial @xmath10 and carrying out a generalised zakharov transformation similarly as in  @xcite we obtain @xmath18 further details of the calculation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that without the classicality assumption there would not be a fixed - point solution .",
    "our numerical setup is the same as in  @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarise the details that are relevant for the present discussion .",
    "we use a standard lattice discretisation scheme in terms of link variables @xmath19 representing parallel transporters from the lattice site @xmath20 to @xmath21 . given the link variables one can compute the gauge fields as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , are the pauli matrices and @xmath24 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we compute the real time evolution of gauge fields by solving the discrete equations of motion derived from a variation of the wilson lattice action in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the initial conditions are sampled from a gaussian distribution such that @xmath25 for the gauge fields in momentum space .",
    "the expectation values occurring in the definitions of the correlation functions   have to be taken with respect to this distribution .",
    "we numerically follow the time evolution of the gauge fields to times far beyond the saturation of the instabilities . computing the fourier spectrum here",
    "denotes the classical approximation to the object defined in eq .  .",
    "] of @xmath26 at late times in coulomb gauge we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig - power - laws ] that the spectrum converges towards a stationary curve . fitting a power law ansatz @xmath27 as in eq .   to the latest available spectrum on the domain @xmath28",
    "we obtain @xmath29 we can produce a slightly higher exponent of @xmath30 by including also the lowest momenta into the fit",
    ". however , this increases @xmath31 per degree of freedom to 1.7 , in contrast to @xmath32 for the fit underlying  .",
    "therefore , the result quoted in   is more reliable and we note that it is in excellent agreement with eq .  .",
    "in any case our data is incompatible with @xmath33 and also with the thermal value @xmath34 .",
    "the fit results are visualised in fig .",
    "[ fig - power - laws ] .",
    "the analytical and numerical results for the spectral index are in excellent agreement .",
    "their numerical value also agrees with the one found for the uv- spectrum of scalar field theories in the context of early - universe cosmology  @xcite .    what is the meaning of these findings ? comparing the present results to  @xcite shows that some features of qcd are quantitatively the same as for scalar theories .",
    "this might allow to establish the notion of universality far from equilibrium .",
    "in fact , quantum corrections will eventually drive the system away from the classical fixed - point solution in the uv .",
    "however , they will not alter the infrared behaviour , as it is known from scalar theories  @xcite .",
    "it remains as a future project to search for nonthermal fixed points in the ir- sector of the gauge theory .",
    "also , it would be desirable to discuss fixed points in terms of gauge - invariant quantities .",
