    "empirical properties of infinite nuclear matter can be calculated using many different theoretical approaches .",
    "the most microscopic ones start from a realistic two - body free nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction with parameters fitted to nn scattering phaseshifts in different partial wave channels and to properties of the deuteron @xcite . taking these bare nn interactions as input into many - body formalism , such as the relativistic dirac - bruckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approximation and",
    "its non - relativistic counterpart bhf @xcite , variational methods @xcite , correlated basis function @xcite , self - consistent greens function models ( scgf ) @xcite , quantum monte carlo techniques @xcite and chiral effective field theory @xcite an effective nn interaction , which includes the effect of the medium , is derived and the many - body problem approximately solved .",
    "various many - body approaches typically lead to an over prediction of the saturation density @xmath0 of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) , at which the binding energy per nucleon reaches its maximum , and of the corresponding maximum binding energy @xmath1(@xmath2=@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "there are many ways of estimating the experimental value of @xmath0 , including different variants of the liquid drop models , optical model of nn scattering , muonic atoms , and hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation of nuclear density distributions ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the range of results is rather broad but a consensus value is @xmath0=0.17@xmath30.03 @xmath4 .",
    "the empirical value @xmath1 per nucleon @xmath5 16 mev can be extracted from the semi - empirical mass formula or from the extrapolation of binding energies of heavy nuclei .",
    "theoretical calculation of saturation properties of snm is not only dependent on the choice of the bare nn interaction but also on the method of treatment of many - body effects .",
    "for example , if the bhf approximation is used , @xmath1 and @xmath0 are correlated within a narrow band @xcite .",
    "two main approaches have been suggested to improve the theoretical calculation of saturation properties of snm , the most frequently used being the inclusion of 3-body ( nnn ) forces . as the form of these forces is unknown , different _ ad hoc _ parameterizations have been used , dependent on additional variable parameters that need to be fitted to account for the delicate balance between the strong ( nnn ) attraction and ( nn ) repulsion at short distances .",
    "alternatively , dbhf calculations have been shown to be effective without the need for nnn forces @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to treat the scalar and vector densities in the walecka relativistic mean - field model @xcite as equal @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic deviation of all theoretical predictions from the expected empirical values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 remains a problem .",
    "an interesting suggestion by dewulf _",
    "@xcite implies that treatment of short - range correlations in nuclear matter in the scgf model brings the saturation density closer to the empirical value than do current bhf calculations .",
    "careful examination of the effect of long - range correlations on nuclear saturation properties through coherent pion - exchange contributions to the binding energy of nuclear matter is equally important .",
    "such correlations are not present in finite nuclei and a question arises as to how applicable are liquid drop model predictions , based on properties of finite nuclei , to saturation properties of nuclear matter .",
    "quite a different perspective on treating many - nucleon systems is to use effective density dependent nn and nnn interactions instead of realistic ones .",
    "the pioneering models of khler @xcite , brink and boeker @xcite , moszkowski @xcite , skyrme @xcite , further developed by vautherin and brink ( see @xcite and references therein ) and gogny @xcite initiated this approach , widely used today .",
    "the basic idea is to parameterize the nn and nnn interactions by zero range ( skyrme model ) , short finite range ( gogny model ) and indefinite range ( separable monopole model ( smo ) @xcite ) density dependent functionals to describe the ground state properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter . in this scenario ,",
    "the microscopic details of nn and nnn forces , such as meson exchange , are not explicitly considered and all the physically relevant information is carried by the parameters of the density dependent phenomenological forces which include the spin , orbital angular momentum and isospin couplings .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that the parameterization of such forces is not unique and there exist , in principle , an infinite number of parameter sets , fitted to ground state properties of ( doubly- or semi - magic ) stable nuclei , fission barriers , energies of giant resonances and symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) .",
    "this situation arises in part because there is no unambiguous connection between individual parameters , or groups of parameters , of these forces with particular physical properties of the many - body nuclear system .",
    "many parameters are strongly correlated .",
    "it is obviously desirable to constrain the parameterizations of effective density dependent forces as much as possible .",
    "the strategy chosen in this work is to concentrate first on application of the forces to modelling different variants of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "although nuclear matter is an idealized medium , and all its properties , derived from experiments indirectly in a model dependent way , are _ empirical _ quantities , it offers an important insight into specific parts of the phenomenological interaction and has important applications in the theory of heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) and the physics of neutron stars .",
    "this paper focuses on the skyrme interaction and is the first part of a series in which nuclear matter constraints will be applied to each class of effective density dependent interaction .",
    "it will be followed by investigation of gogny and smo forces and interactions used in relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models .",
    "after this work is complete , the implications of the consequences for the theory of finite nuclei will be investigated .",
    "we use the most up - to - date constraints on nuclear matter properties which go much beyond the minimal conditions on snm ( saturation density , binding energy , incompressibility and symmetry energy at saturation ) .",
    "new data from hic , giant monopole and dipole resonance experiments as well as new observational data on neutron stars provide new constraints on the performance of individual skyrme parameterizations in nuclear matter .",
    "the set of eleven macroscopic constraints used in this work have been mainly derived from experimental data , on the assumption of the validity of the liquid - drop model @xcite , and concern properties of snm at and close to the saturation point .",
    "studies of dilute fermi gas provide constraints on low density pure neutron matter ( pnm ) equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "dynamical models of hic further constrain the density dependence of pressure in snm and pnm at subsaturation density and extrapolate these constraints to higher densities .",
    "mean - field hartree - fock + random phase approximation ( rpa ) , used in calculating giant resonance excitation energies both in relativistic and non - relativistic models , provide a final group of constraints on the incompressibility of nuclear matter and its density and symmetry dependence .",
    "in addition to the above macroscopic constraints , several more microscopic constraints are employed .",
    "these include the density dependence of the nucleon effective masses in beta - equilibrium matter ( bem ) , the landau parameters for snm and pnm and of the symmetry energy .",
    "observational data on cold non - rotational high - mass and low - mass neutron stars provide a final group of constraints .    in this work we consider 240 skyrme parameter sets , currently available in the literature , and critically compare their predictions for a wide variety of properties of snm , pnm , asymmetric matter with fixed ratio proton fraction ( anm ) and bem with all available constraints in the density range from @xmath50.1@xmath0 to 3@xmath0 , estimated on the best available experimental and theoretical grounds .",
    "the range of applicability of the skyrme force is a very important issue which is often mishandled .",
    "the skyrme interaction , originally constructed for finite nuclei and nuclear matter at saturation density , is a low momentum expansion of the effective two - body nn interaction in momentum space , and both the lower and upper limits of its validity are not firmly established .",
    "the important point about the skyrme interaction is that some correlation effects are included through its parameters .",
    "thus , although formulated as zero - range in coordinate space @xcite , it exhibits some finite - range features @xcite .    for finite nuclei ,",
    "the best evidence for a lower limit derives from the fact that skyrme models reasonably predict the observed abrupt decrease of density at the nuclear surface , and neutron and proton mean - square radii .",
    "the sensitivity extends down to about 0.1@xmath0 .    in uniform snm",
    "the skyrme interaction has been used to make prediction of the appearance of light clusters ( deuterons , tritons , @xmath6he and alpha - particles in hot matter in the region of density of 0.6 - 1.25@xmath7 @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , abundance of light clusters with @xmath813 in supernova envelopes at finite temperature was calculated at density range 0.01 - 0.5@xmath0 using the skyrme functional @xcite .",
    "the `` pasta '' phase , predicted in neutron star and supernova matter in a variety of models @xcite , was successfully modeled in supernova matter in a density range 0.25 - 0.75@xmath0 in self - consistent hf+bcs calculation with skm * and sly4 skyrme interaction @xcite .",
    "pnm has been mainly studied as an approximation to a low density fermi gas .",
    "schwenk and pethick @xcite explored , in a model independent way , the neutron matter eos at densities 0.0125 - 0.125@xmath0 , and epelbaum _ et al . _",
    "@xcite calculated the ground state energy of dilute neutron matter at next - to - leading - order in lattice chiral effective field theory in the density range 0.02 - 0.1@xmath0 .",
    "quantum monte carlo techniques have been applied to low density pnm , providing a constraint for on the eos up to saturation density @xcite . to our knowledge , there has not yet been a detailed study of the applicability of the skyrme interaction at these low densities in pnm .",
    "such a study is of a particular interest as it may be one of the best ways to model the crust of neutron stars .    the upper density limit of validity of the skyrme interaction reflects the fact that at higher densities relativistic effects should be increasingly important .",
    "the appearance of heavy strange baryons and mesons in the matter is ultimately inevitable .",
    "due to pauli blocking , the chemical potential of the neutrons increases rapidly with density . at some point",
    ", it becomes energetically favourable for the system to let the neutrons undergo a strangeness changing weak decay , which replaces them by hyperons , for which the fermi sea is not yet filled . from the difference of mass between the neutron and its strange partners it follows that the critical density , at which hyperons should appear , is 2 - 3@xmath0 . using a nucleon - only skyrme interaction beyond this density",
    "can be expected to yield misleading results .",
    "this is discussed later in connection with high - mass neutron star models .",
    "taking all the above pieces of evidence into account , we adopt 0.01@xmath9 3@xmath0 as the range of validity of the skyrme interactions considered in this work .",

    ", the performance of cskp in finite nuclei will be studied in more detail @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to test the quality of the skyrme functional by extending the fitting protocol to include not only all the constraints studied in this work but also requirements based on the most up - to - date finite nuclei data , including drip - line and superheavy nuclei .",
    "it may turn out that the ambition to fit using such a detailed protocol may be asking too much of the skyrme model ( with its known deficiencies @xcite ) but the attempt may also lead to a parameterization with increased predictive power .",
    "it is our opinion that a parameterization , successful in reproducing only a selected subset of available data but failing the rest , does not have credible predictive power and does not progress the field .",
    "results obtained in this paper should be seen as the first step in a global effort to find the best possible skyrme interactions for use in modeling of nuclear matter .",
    "we intend to monitor developments both in keeping up - to - date the existing constraints and adopting new ones .",
    "progress in _ ab - initio _ calculations of inhomogeneous neutron matter @xcite and chiral effective field theory @xcite are good examples of sources of new constraints which will be taken into account in future .",
    "new experimental results on giant resonances , neutron skin in heavy nuclei and heavy ion collision , as well as new astrophysical observations will further improve the set of benchmark constraints , which may shed more light on the structure and applicability of the skyrme interaction .",
    "should new skyrme parameter sets appear in the literature , we intend to catalogue and test them using the most complete set of constraints available to us .    the outcome of our analysis of all , standard and non - standard , parameterizations does not offer a final solution to the `` skyrme proliferation '' problem .",
    "neither does it provide general guidance for construction of more skyrme parameter sets .",
    "production of new parameter sets having limited range of application should not be encouraged .",
    "rather , more emphasis should be put on better understanding of the existing models , which should be further tested against an extended number of refined constraints including both , nuclear matter _ and _ finite nuclei related properties , with equal emphasis .",
    "the skyrme interaction has played a dominant role in low energy nuclear physics for decades .",
    "the approach suggested can lead to the final judgment whether or not this interaction includes enough physics not only for a successful interpretation , but also for a prediction , of the rich variety of data and observations on nuclear and astrophysical systems available today and expected in future .",
