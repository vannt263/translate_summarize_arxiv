    "experimental data on @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions at display a very strong suppression pattern in the transverse momentum region , which indicates a clear evidence of the presence of induced jet energy loss in hot dense matter  @xcite .",
    "quantitative calculations of the energy loss in @xmath4 collisions require the precise description of the available data from @xmath5 collisions .",
    "these data incorporate initial state effects ( nuclear multiscattering and nuclear shadowing ) and possible final state effects ( e.g. energy loss in cold nuclear matter ) , which should be understood .",
    "in this paper we accomplish the analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath2 data in a leading - order ( lo ) perturbative qcd based model  @xcite . we plan to repeat our analysis in next - to - leading ( nlo ) order  @xcite , when final data will be available for pion production in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the invariant cross section for pion production in @xmath1 collision can be described in a lo pqcd - improved parton model on the basis of the factorization theorem as a convolution  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hard scattering cross section of the partonic subprocess @xmath8 , and the fragmentation function ( ff ) , @xmath9 gives the probability for parton @xmath10 to fragment into hadron @xmath11 with momentum fraction @xmath12 at scale @xmath13 . for fragmentation functions we use the kkp parameterization  @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the colliding partons @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the interacting protons as functions of momentum fraction @xmath18 , at scale @xmath19 .",
    "we use a product approximation , namely @xmath20 , where the function @xmath21 represents the standard lo pdf ( here it is the grv set  @xcite ) . in our phenomenological approach the transverse - momentum distribution is described by a gaussian , [ ktgauss ] g(*k*_t )  =   ( - ) . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the 2-dimensional width of the @xmath23 distribution and it is related to the magnitude of the average transverse momentum of a parton as @xmath24 .",
    "the validity of this approximation and the introduction of the transverse component into the pdfs were under debate for a long time .",
    "however , recent measurement of di - hadron correlations by phenix  @xcite and the theoretical investigation of these data  @xcite have shown that a large value for the @xmath23-imbalance can be extracted from existing di - hadron data .",
    "the origin of this @xmath23-imbalance is three - fold : intrinsic transverse momenta of the partons , non - perturbative soft radiation and higher order radiation terms .",
    "we consider these effects phenomenologically and our @xmath22 value accumulates all of these effects . as we will see , the size of this @xmath22 can be extracted consistently from one - particle spectra and two - particle correlations .    in our present study",
    "we consider fixed scales : the factorization scale is connected to the momentum of the intermediate jet , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 ) , while the fragmentation scale is connected to the final hadron momentum , @xmath27 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 can be varied in a wide range , however we will use @xmath29 , which is the best choice to obtain agreement between data and theory at high-@xmath30 , where non - perturbative effects have a small contribution .",
    "figure 1 displays our results at @xmath31 gev for @xmath32  @xcite at different values of the @xmath33imbalance . without transverse momentum component for partons",
    "the theoretical results underestimate the data by a factor of 2 in the window 2 gev @xmath34 5 gev . to minimize the difference between rhic data and the model , a value of @xmath35 gev@xmath36 can be selected .",
    "this value indicates which is compatible with the value obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite from di - hadron spectra .",
    "our earlier studies have shown that the theoretical reproduction of the one - hadron spectra in a pqcd frame strongly requires the introduction of a large @xmath33imbalance in both lo and nlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of di - hadron correlations in nlo frame would give more insight into this problem .",
    "considering the @xmath2 collision , the hard pion production cross section can be written as an integral over impact parameter @xmath17 , where the geometry of the collision is described in the glauber picture  @xcite : [ daux ] e _ = d^2b d^2r t_d(r ) t_au(|*b * - * r*| ) e _ , where the proton - proton cross section on the right hand side represents the cross section from eq .",
    "( [ hadpp ] ) , but with the broadened widths of the transverse - momentum distributions in eq .",
    "( [ ktgauss ] ) , as a consequence of nuclear multiscattering ( see eq .",
    "( [ ktbroadpa ] ) ) . in eq .",
    "( [ daux ] ) , @xmath37 is the nuclear thickness function ( in terms of the density distribution of the gold nucleus , @xmath38 ) , normalized as @xmath39 . for the deuteron",
    ", one could use a superposition of a @xmath40 and a @xmath41 collision , or a distribution for the nucleons inside the deuteron . here",
    "we apply a hard - sphere approximation for the deuteron with a=2 for estimating the nuclear effects .",
    "also , since @xmath0 production is not sensitive to isospin , we continue to use the notation `` @xmath42 '' when talking about the interaction of any nucleon with a nucleus .",
    "the initial state broadening of the incoming parton distribution function is accounted for by an increase in the width of the gaussian parton transverse momentum distribution in eq .",
    "( [ ktgauss ] ) @xcite : [ ktbroadpa ] 2av_pa = 2av_pp + c h_pa(b )  . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the width of the transverse momentum distribution of partons in @xmath1 collisions , @xmath44 describes the number of _ effective _ nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions at impact parameter @xmath17 , which impart an average transverse momentum squared @xmath45 .",
    "the effectivity function @xmath44 can be written in terms of the number of collisions suffered by the incoming proton in the target nucleus , @xmath46 . here , @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "for the factor @xmath45 and @xmath49 we will use the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the systematic analysis of @xmath42 reactions was performed in lo and the characteristics of the cronin effect were determined at lo level .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that only a limited number of semi - hard collisions ( with maximum @xmath50 ) contributes to the broadening , and we have found @xmath51 0.4 gev@xmath36 .",
    "the maximum of the broadening is and this value determines the maximum increase in the particle yield .",
    "it is well - known that the pdfs are modified in the nuclear environment and nuclear shadowing appears for partons with momentum fraction @xmath52 .",
    "this is taken into account by various shadowing parameterizations  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we display results obtained with the eks parameterization , which has an antishadowing feature@xcite , and with the updated hijing parameterization@xcite , which incorporates different quark and gluon shadowing and requires the introduction of nuclear multiscattering . as a third case",
    ", we consider the nuclear parton distribution functions introduced by hkm  @xcite .",
    "since beyond nuclear shadowing the nuclear multiscattering may appear , we will apply the hkm parametrization alone and in a combination with our multiscattering description .",
    "including the multiscattering and shadowing effects one can calculate the invariant cross section for pion production in @xmath5 collision . moreover , introducing the nuclear modification factor @xmath53 , as [ rdau ] r_dau = = ,   nuclear effects can be investigated clearly and efficiently , using a linear scale .",
    "the value of @xmath54 can be determined using the glauber geometrical overlap integral as in eq .",
    "( [ daux ] ) . here",
    "we apply the right - most equation in our theoretical calculations , which does not require the determination of @xmath54 from the glauber model .",
    "figure 2 summarizes our theoretical results in four centrality bins for the nuclear modification factor @xmath53 in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath31 agev , displaying different shadowing models .",
    "preliminary phenix data are from ref .",
    "@xcite .    at first glance ,",
    "the experimental data have a striking message at all centrality bins : the nuclear modification factor shows a @xmath55 deviation from unity in wide momentum regions in all centrality bins , including the most central and the most peripheral ones . since these @xmath55 deviations overlap with the systematic error of these experimental data , we can not exclude the scenario of a null effect , which means no multiscattering and no shadowing are present at rhic energies .",
    "fortunately the nuclear modification factor has been measured at higher rapidities and the influence of nuclear shadowing can be seen clearly  @xcite , which excludes the null effect scenario .",
    "this means that there is a delicate interplay between nuclear shadowing and multiscattering ( or the antishadowing feature of the shadowing functions ) .",
    "investigating the experimental data from this point of view , we may recognize a slight b - dependence for both multiscattering and shadowing . in the most peripheral collisions ( 60 - 88 % ) multiscattering overwhelms the shadowing - or shadowing function has a clear antishadowing region to be involved in the pion production in the region @xmath56 gev / c .",
    "the enhancement can be reproduced by the eks ( thin dashed line ) and the hkm shadowing ( solid line ) , the scenario of hkm+multiscattering ( dotted line ) is satisfactory only because of the large error bars .",
    "hijing ( thick dashed line ) displays no nuclear modification  more precise data may help us to choose between the different scenarios . in the most central collisions ( 0 - 20 % ) in the intermediate transverse momentum window",
    "the @xmath57 enhancement appears through the superposition of a stronger shadowing and a more effective multiscattering connected to the geometry of the collisions .",
    "if final data will have a smaller error bars , then we may be able to select between the different theoretical models .",
    "however , data in the most central bins ( 0 - 20 % ) display an interesting phenomenon at high-@xmath30 : although all model calculations with nuclear multiscattering and shadowing lead to unity , the experimental data are decreasing with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "the authors are not aware of any shadowing parametrization , which could yield such a suppression around @xmath58 gev at rhic energies , and any nuclear multiscattering should work in the opposite direction .",
    "this suppression in central @xmath2 collisions may indicate the presence of a new phenomena , namely a moderate jet energy loss in the cold matter produced in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "cold quenching of high energy quarks is known from the hermes experiment  @xcite , and recently it was investigated theoretically ( see refs .",
    "the question of cold quenching is very complicated , and it is strongly related to the microscopical description of hadronization ( see ref .",
    "thus recent @xmath2 data with large error bars can not give a deep insight into this phenomena beyond indicating its existence in the most central bins .",
    "we estimated this effect with a simple rescaling of the hkm+multiscattering scenario .",
    "figure 3 indicates that @xmath2 data in the most central bin can accommodate a 10 - 15 % suppression .",
    "we have investigated the interplay between nuclear shadowing and multiscattering at rhic energies in @xmath2 collisions . since the nuclear modification factor",
    ", @xmath53 , has a value close to unity in large transverse momentum regions , the two effects seem to balance each other within @xmath59 , which makes the separation and the quantitative analysis of these effects in the mid - rapidity difficult",
    ". final data with smaller error bars may lessen this complication .",
    "the characteristic suppression of the nuclear modification factor at high-@xmath30 in the most central @xmath2 collisions may indicate the presence of a moderate jet energy loss .",
    "quantitative analysis requires the introduction of proper theoretical models for jet energy loss in cold nuclear matter .",
