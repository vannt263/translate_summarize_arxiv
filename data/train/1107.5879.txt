    "the introduction of quadruplet @xmath46 in the model can have interesting consequences for neutrino masses , mixing and also for lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversion because the vev of @xmath46 is constrained to be small which then can lead to a large yukawa coupling @xmath66 .",
    "we also found some interesting collider signatures of the doubly charged higgs boson in the quadruplet . in the following",
    "we will study the quadruplet model in more details .",
    "we have seen that in type iii seesaw , it is possible to introduce a quadruplet higgs which give additional seesaw contributions to neutrino masses at the tree level .",
    "it is , however , well known that electroweak precision data constrain the vev of a higgs representation because a non - zero vev of some higgs may break the @xmath67 custodial symmetry in the sm leading to a large deviation of the @xmath68 parameter from unity . with",
    "the constraints satisfied , the higgs doublet and quadruplet may contribute to the neutrino mass matrix differently .",
    "the non - zero vev of the higgs representation with isospin @xmath69 and hypercharge @xmath70 will modify the @xmath68 parameter at tree level with@xcite , @xmath71 the sm doublet higgs alone does not lead to a deviation of @xmath68 from unity , but the addition of a quadruplet does . for our case of one doublet and one quadruplet ,",
    "we have @xmath72 we therefore have , @xmath73 . using experimental data @xmath74(95% c.l.)@xcite ,",
    "we see that @xmath55 is constrained to be less than 5.8 gev which is about 40 times smaller than that of the doublet higgs vev .",
    "this vast difference in higgs vev s indeed indicate that the higgs doublet and quadruplet contribute to the neutrino mass matrix differently in the sense that if the yukawa couplings @xmath75 and @xmath66 are the same order of magnitude , they contribute to the neutrino masses can be different by orders of magnitude . turning this around , if both higgs contribute to the neutrino masses with the same orders of magnitude , then the yukawa coupling for quadruplet @xmath66 can be several orders of magnitude larger than that for the doublet @xmath75 .",
    "if the seesaw mass is only from the coupling to @xmath76 , just like type iii seesaw with one doublet , the canonical yukawa coupling is of order @xmath77 . with a @xmath78 of order @xmath11 tev",
    ", the yukawa couplings would be less than @xmath79 with @xmath59 around @xmath80 ev .",
    "this makes it clear that even the heavy degrees of freedom are kinematically accessible at the lhc@xcite , the small yukawa couplings is hard to study their properties and their effects on lfv processes@xcite .",
    "although it has been shown that there are solutions with large yukawa coupling in type iii seesaw with just one higgs doublet@xcite , it is interesting to see if large yukawa couplings can more naturally manifest itself .",
    "the quadruplet with a small vev provides such a possibility .",
    "the natural size of the yukawa coupling @xmath66 is of order @xmath81 . with @xmath55 of order 1 gev , @xmath66",

    "the large yukawa coupling @xmath66 can lead to interesting phenomenology , such as the possibility of having large effects in lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes @xmath2 and @xmath1 conversion .",
    "in the type iii seesaw with just doublet higgs , if there is just one leptonic triplet @xmath83 , the resulting neutrino mass matrix @xmath59 for the three light neutrinos is only a rank one matrix .",
    "this implies that only one light neutrino mass is non - zero .",
    "neutrino oscillation data show the existence of two distinct mass squared splittings , so a model with just one generation of triplet @xmath83 is in conflict with data .",
    "more than one generation of @xmath83 is required to have a higher ranked mass matrix to fit data .",
    "we point out that with the introduction of quadruplet @xmath46 , it is possible to raise the rank of neutrino mass matrix by including one loop contributions to the mass matrix .",
    "the tree and loop generated mass matrices together can be consistent with present data on neutrino mass and mixing . with both higgs doublet and quadruplet , the tree level light neutrino mass matrix @xmath59 given in eq .",
    "is still rank one if there is only one generation of @xmath83 . in the following",
    "we show that the inclusion of one loop contribution can raise the rank of the mass matrix to two .",
    "the one loop contributions involve exchange of internal quadruplet higgs bosons and heavy leptons . in order to show this mechanism explicitly , we first identify physical higgs states and mixing necessary for one loop generation of neutrino mass from the higgs potential .",

    "@xmath91 then mixes @xmath76 and @xmath46 fields . at one loop level majorana masses will be generated for light neutrinos .",
    "there are three types of mixing terms which can be characterized to be proportional to @xmath92 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "we have seen earlier that @xmath43 is much larger than @xmath55 from electroweak precision data , therefore one can just keep terms proportional to @xmath92 for the loop generation of neutrino masses .",

    "this mechanism can also work even when we introduce an additional scalar doublet@xcite .",
    "however such a scalar is indistinguishable from a sm higgs doublet without additional quantum charges .",
    "the extra doublet fields can interact with other sm fermions and will induce large tree level flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) for the charged leptons . in this model , the tree level fcnc",

    "the mass matrix obtained in the previous section , being rank two , has two non - zero eigenvalues .",
    "one of the neutrino masses is predicted to be zero .",
    "the zero mass neutrino can be @xmath117 or @xmath118 depending on whether the neutrino masses have normal or inverted hierarchy . in this section , we show that the mass matrix obtained can be made consistent with experimental data on mixing parameters .",

    ", we then have @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 . the neutrino mixing",
    "are given by@xcite @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "to the leading order , the mixing pattern can be approximated by the tribimaximal mixing matrix@xcite , @xmath136 the light neutrino mass matrix obtained in eq . can be easily made to fit data .",
    "we consider the case for @xmath137 , such that terms proportional to @xmath55 can all be neglected for illustration . with this approximation ,",
    "the cross term proportional to @xmath138 can be neglected .    for normal hierarchy case , by imposing the condition of the tribimaximal mixing ,",
    "the yukawa couplings can be taken to be the forms @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . in this case @xmath141 and @xmath142 . if the heavy neutrino mass is of order 1 tev , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "we note that relative size of tree level and loop level contributions can be tuned by the parameter @xmath113 , which is proportional to the higgs potential parameter @xmath100 . if @xmath100 is small , quaruplet yukawa coupling @xmath145 can be order of one .",
    "this kind of possibility is also studied in the neutrinophilic two higgs doublet model@xcite .",
    "the role of the @xmath75 and @xmath66 can be switched .",
    "similarly the model can be made consistent with inverted hierarchy .",
    "for example with @xmath146 and @xmath140 , the tribimaximal mixing pattern can be realized . in this case @xmath147 and @xmath142 . if the heavy neutrino mass is of order 1 tev , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "again the roles of @xmath75 and @xmath66 can be switched .",
    "making perturbation to the above forms , one can get non - zero @xmath150 solutions , which is indicated by recent results at t2k@xcite .",
    "for instance , for normal mass hierarchy case modifying @xmath75 to be @xmath151 and keep the same @xmath66 , we can produce non - zero @xmath150 solutions . using the @xmath152 ev",

    ", we obtain @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 which are , again , within one @xmath159 error of the data .",
    "higher order loop corrections can further raise the rank of neutrino mass matrix in general .",
    "therefore , all three light neutrinos can have non - zero masses in this model . it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the rank of the neutrino mass matrix can be rank two at two loop level even with just one triplet lepton and one higgs doublet . however , in this case the heavy triplet lepton mass needs to be @xmath167 gev , and hence its phenomenological consequence for collider physics is out of the scope at the lhc .",
    "introduction of more leptonic triplet generations can also increase the rank of mass matrix too .",
    "we now study possible effects on lfv processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversion .",

    "one of the interesting feature of type iii seesaw is that the heavy leptons with a mass of a tev or lower can be produced at the lhc .",
    "the collider phenomenology related to type iii seesaw for the heavy leptons has been studied in great detail@xcite .",
    "the introduction of quadruplet also leads to new phenomena in collider physics .",
    "an interesting feature is the existence of the doubly charged particle @xmath208 in the model .",
    "doubly charged scalar bosons also appear in other models for neutrino masses , for example , higgs triplet in type ii seesaw model@xcite , and zee - babu model@xcite .",
    "the doubly charged scalar bosons can be produced at a hadron collider through the drell - yan production mechanism @xmath209@xcite .",
    "the vector boson fusion mechanism can also be useful to produce doubly charged particle@xcite if the vev s of the higgs triplet @xmath210 and the quadruplet @xmath55 are not very small .",
    "the recently results from lhc exclude doubly charged higgs mass to be around @xmath211 gev if it decay predominantly through leptonic decay@xcite . unlike the type ii",
    "seesaw and zee - babu models , the quadruplet scalars do not have direct interaction with a pair of sm fermion and therefore can not decay into them",
    ". the lower limit on the mass of doubly charged higgs boson does not apply for our model .    in both type ii seesaw and the quadruplet models , if the vev s @xmath210 and @xmath55 are not very small , the doubly charged scalar will mainly decay into a pair of @xmath212@xcite .",
    "zee - babu model does not have such decay modes . in the case of type ii seesaw model , if @xmath213 gev , the leptonic pair decay modes will become the dominate one for the doubly charged scalar because the decay to gauge boson pair is suppressed by @xmath214 while leptonic yukawa coupling is scaled as @xmath215 .",
    "this is , however , not the case for quadruplet model .",
    "the @xmath208 can couple to @xmath216 through yukawa coupling .",
    "since the heavy charged lepton @xmath217 can mixing with @xmath218 because mixing in eq .",
    "leading to @xmath219 .",
    "however , the mixing in this case is proportional to @xmath220 which is small .",
    "there is another possible decay for @xmath208 .",
    "electromagnetic loop correction@xcite will make @xmath217 to be heavier than @xmath221 allowing @xmath222 .",
    "then @xmath221 mixes with light neutrinos to allow @xmath223 decay .",
    "since the mixing between light neutrino and @xmath221 is only suppressed by a factor @xmath224 , the decay mode , @xmath225 would be more important than @xmath226 .",
    "this is different than type ii seesaw model in the case even the vev s are very small .",
    "in type iii seesaw the heavy neutrinos are contained in leptonic triplet representations .",
    "being a triplet of @xmath227 gauge group , the heavy leptons have non - trivial structure . concerning yukawa interaction for seesaw mechanism ,",
    "we find a new possibility of having new type of yukawa couplings by introducing a quadruplet @xmath46 with hypercharge equal to half . when the neutral component field of @xmath46 develops a non - zero vev , a dirac mass terms connecting the light and heavy neutrinos can result to facilitate the seesaw mechanism .",
    "it is interesting to note that the vev of the quadruplet higgs is constrained to be very small from electroweak precision data .",
    "therefore the yukawa couplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those in a type iii model with a higgs doublet only .",
    "we also find that unlike the usual type iii seesaw model where at least two copies of leptonic triplets are needed , with both doublet and quadruplet higgs representations , just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a phenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive sizable contributions from both the tree and one loop levels .",
    "large yukawa coupling may have observable effects on lepton flavor violating processes , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversion .",
    "there are also some interesting collider signatures for the doubly charged particle in the quadruplet model .",

    "<S> in type iii seesaw model the heavy neutrinos are contained in leptonic triplet representations . </S>",
    "<S> the yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the left - handed neutrinos with the doublet higgs field produce the dirac mass terms . together with the majorana masses for </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic triplets , the light neutrinos obtain non - zero seesaw masses . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that it is also possible to have a quadruplet higgs field to produce the dirac mass terms to facilitate the seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet higgs is constrained to be small by electroweak precision data . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the yukawa couplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that unlike the usual type iii seesaw model where at least two copies of leptonic triplets are needed , with both doublet and quadruplet higgs representations , just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a phenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive sizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels . </S>",
    "<S> large yukawa couplings of the quadruplet can induce observable effects for lepton flavor violating processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 conversion . </S>",
    "<S> implications of the recent @xmath2 limit from meg and also limit on @xmath3 conversion on au are also given . </S>",
    "<S> some interesting collider signatures for the doubly charged higgs boson in the quadruplet are discussed . </S>"
