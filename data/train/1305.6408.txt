    "as mentioned already , uniform convergence implies hypi - convergence but not conversely .",

    "<S> in the past decades , weak convergence theory for stochastic processes has become a standard tool for analyzing the asymptotic properties of various statistics . </S>",
    "<S> routinely , weak convergence is considered in the space of bounded functions equipped with the supremum metric . however , there are cases when weak convergence in those spaces fails to hold . </S>",

    "<S> to resolve the issue , a new metric for locally bounded functions is introduced and the corresponding weak convergence theory is developed . </S>",
    "<S> convergence with respect to the new metric is related to epi- and hypo - convergence and is weaker than uniform convergence . </S>",
