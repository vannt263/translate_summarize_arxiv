    "within the @xmath3cdm cosmology framework , mergers or interactions play a fundamental role in the formation , growth and subsequent galactic evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , as shown in merger trees of hierarchical models of galaxy formation , the galactic growth is driven by accretion of other galaxies , most often minor companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite their importance , these minor mergers have been less studied than major merger interactions @xcite . from the observational point of view , the statistical samples show a bias favouring major mergers , due to the large magnitude differences between galaxies and the magnitude limit set by redshift @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations also show a trend to study major interactions , since the computational cost is larger for minor mergers , due to the higher resolution required to model the small companions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there have been significant advances in understanding minor mergers .",
    "for instance , numerical simulations indicate that they can trigger star formation and transform the morphologies of galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these results have been confirmed by observational studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , minor mergers are also recognized as potential agents to drive the morphological evolution of galaxies .",
    "for example , as a result of a satellite accretion , the galactic discs can become warped and heated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or inner structures can be created , such as discs , rings and spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , the interaction with a small companion can generate all kinds of phenomenons seen in majors cases , such as tidal tails , bridges , rings , as well as form or destruct bars or spiral arms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the velocity fields of the large galaxy often shows asymmetries and irregularities due to the interaction with the smaller companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such distortions are seen in the rotation curves as significantly rising or falling profiles on the side pointing towards the companion galaxy , or pronounced velocity bumps , which are stronger at perigalacticum passages and decline 0.5 gyr after that @xcite .",
    "the kinematic and photometric effects caused by minor mergers strongly depend on structural parameters , such as morphological type ( bulge , disc , bar , etc . ) , baryonic - to - dark mass ratios , and orbital parameters , such as retrograde , prograde , inclination and coplanar orbits @xcite .",
    "thus , obtaining photometric and kinematic informations on minor merger systems is useful for understanding the effects that interaction may have on each component .",
    "the decomposition of the surface brightness profile can be used to infer the stellar mass distribution .",
    "rotation curves are used to constrain models of dark matter distribution @xcite .    in order to investigate the interaction effects on kinematic and photometric properties of minor merger components ,",
    "we have selected several systems from @xcite and @xcite samples of interacting galaxies taken from the arp - madore catalogue @xcite .",
    "these pairs consist of a main galaxy ( component a ) and a companion ( component b ) that has about half or less the diameter of component a. the pairs lack basic information , such as morphological types , magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "optical spectroscopic properties ( e.g , star formation rates , diagnostic diagrams , stellar population ) of these samples have been already studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . from their samples ,",
    "we have selected systems in which the main component has a well - defined spiral structure , so that the effect of the interaction in the arms is easily seen , and the galactic disc has an inclination ( @xmath4 ) with respect to the plane of the sky of 30@xmath570 . in addition",
    ", these systems have different separations between the components , morphological distortions and likely interaction stages .",
    "long - slit spectroscopy and images of these systems were obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) at gemini south telescope .",
    "previous results from this project have been presented for the systems am2306 - 721 @xcite , am2322 - 821 @xcite and am1219 - 430 @xcite .",
    "along these works , we have developed a robust methodology to obtain the kinematic and photometric properties of the galaxies in minor mergers .",
    "such properties are valuable constraints for numerical simulations in case studies in order to understand the specific mechanisms that drive the collision in an interaction of unequal mass galaxies . in this paper",

    "the disc and halo have similar weights along the overall radii of the rotation curve , being the halo component somewhat more important than the disc component .",
    "on the order hand , the middle part of the rotation curve of am1228a ( @xmath229 kpc ) is dominated by the halo component , while the disc becomes dominant in the outer parts ( @xmath230 kpc ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the disc component will dominate up to their peak at 10.5kpc , after that , the curve will be dominated completely by the halo component .",
    "the cumulative masses for the disc ( @xmath231 ) and halo ( @xmath232 ) components of the main galaxies , along with the total masses ( @xmath233 ) , are listed in table [ parmodels ] .",
    "these values are estimated inside the equivalent radii of the outermost isophotes .",
    "the total masses of am2058a and am1228a are @xmath218 and @xmath234 , respectively .",
    "thus , the ratio between the integrated masses of both galaxies is proportional to their physical sizes .",

    "a detailed study of the morphology , kinematics and dynamics of the minor mergers am2058 - 381 and am1228 - 260 was performed .",
    "the work is based in @xmath0 images and long - slit spectra in the wavelength range from 4280 to 7130  , obtained with the gmos at gemini south .",
    "the main results are the following :    1 .",
    "am2058a is @xmath1 5 times more luminous than am2058b , while am1228a is @xmath1 20 times more luminous than am1228b .",
    "in addition , am2058 - 381 is a very luminous minor merger when compared to the mw system .",
    "in contrast , the main and secondary galaxies of the pair am1228 - 260 have similar luminosities similar to mw and lmc , respectively .",
    "2 .   for am1228 - 260 we detected a common isophote enclosing the members , which contributes with 20% of the total luminosity of the pair . for the main galaxy of am2058 - 381 , we detected two symmetric , long tidal tails , having only 5% of the system total luminosity .",
    "the main galaxies , am2058a and am1228a , were decomposed in bulge , bar , ring and disc , while the secondary galaxies , am2058b and am1228b , in bulge and disc .",
    "the disc parameters derived for these galaxies agree with the average values found for galaxies with no sign of ongoing interaction or disturbed morphology @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the symmetrization method is adequate to recover the unperturbed disc of the interacting galaxies .",
    "the studied galaxies have pseudo - bulges , with a @xcite index @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the b / t for am2058a , am1228a and am1228b are very small ( b / t @xmath142 ) , which is typical of late - type spirals . for am2058b , b / t is 0.34 , which is similar to the early - type galaxies .",
    "the receding side of the rvp along pa=350  of am2058a departs from the velocity field model .",
    "this departure can be interpreted as if this part of the galaxy is speeding up , and/or as if it is being deviated from the galactic plane due to interaction with am2058b .",
    "there is a strong evidence that am2058b be a tumbling body , rotating along its major axis .",
    "the observed rvps of am1228a indicate that there is a misalignment between kinematic and photometric major axes .",
    "only a small fraction of non - interactions galaxies present this feature @xcite .",
    "the observed rvp at pa=319 for am1228b is quite perturbed , very likely due to the interaction with am1228a .",
    "7 .   the nfw halo parameters ( @xmath176 and @xmath243 found for am2058a are similar to those reported for the mw and m31 , while the halo mass of am1228a is nine times smaller than that of am2058a . it was found a m / l@xmath244 of 3.05 and 1.37 for am2058a and am1228a , respectively .",
    "the m / l@xmath244 of am2058a is in agreement with the mean value derived for late - type spiral galaxies @xcite , while the low m / l@xmath244 obtained for am1228a may be due to the intense star formation ongoing in this galaxy .",
    "the parameters obtained in this paper will serve as a starting point in future numerical simulations to reproduce the dynamical histories and predict the evolution of the encounter of these pairs .",
