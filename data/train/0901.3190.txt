    "interfaces between light and matter are key building blocks of a future _ quantum web _ , a global secure communication network where the manipulation and transmission of information are regulated by the quantum laws @xcite .",
    "the transfer of quantum states and the distribution of correlations across the interfaces are enabled by the common mathematical language of canonically conjugate observables with continuous spectrum , such as the quadratures of light and the collective spin components of atomic ensembles .",
    "it is thus very fascinating to witness how the second generation of quantum information research is focusing more and more , from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints , on the characterization of continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement and its applications for communication , computation and metrology @xcite .    out of the infinite - dimensional hilbert space of cv states ,",
    "a special class of states has played a prominent role in recent years : gaussian states .",
    "their mathematical treatment is advantageous thanks to a compact formalism based on symplectic analysis , and a very accurate degree of control is reached in their experimental realizations with light and matter @xcite .",
    "there are however many tasks which are impossible by using only the gaussian states and operations toolbox ( e.g. , entanglement distillation @xcite and universal quantum computation @xcite ) , and many other tasks which can be sharply improved by suitably resorting to some non - gaussianity ( e.g. cv teleportation @xcite and loss estimation @xcite ) .",
    "these premises have spurred astonishing progresses in the experimental engineering of non - gaussian states , such as fock states and states obtained by degaussifying gaussian resources via addition and/or subtraction of single photons @xcite .",
    "it has been in particular verified experimentally that a photon subtraction from a two - mode squeezed entangled gaussian state leads to an enhancement of the entanglement ( at fixed squeezing ) @xcite , and it is known that such resource might be used for a more performant quantum teleportation of classical and nonclassical states ( a primitive of the quantum internet ) @xcite and for yet - to - be - achieved demonstrations of loophole - free bell tests of nonlocality @xcite . the bottleneck for unleashing the power of non - gaussian cv quantum technology has remained the quantitative characterization of entanglement in states which deviate from gaussianity , a crucial step to evaluate and control their usefulness for applications and the _ bona - fide_ness of their preparation . while for gaussian states all the information is encoded in the second moments of the canonical operators ( collected in the covariance matrix ) , for any other state an infinite hierarchy of moments is in principle needed for an exact entanglement quantification @xcite .",
    "this translates , in experimental terms , into the demand for a complete state tomography @xcite , a process which is time- and resource - consuming especially for two or more modes .    in this paper",
    "we provide an advance in the characterization of non - gaussian entanglement which reduces the complexity of its experimental determination exactly to the same level of gaussian states",
    ". this can not be possible for _ any generic _ non - gaussian state : hence here we focus on the important class of photon - subtracted states ( pss ) under quite realistic conditions @xcite , which represent the preferred resources for most current and future applications requiring non - gaussianity . combining results from the extremality of gaussian states @xcite with an analysis of quadrature correlations , we derive analytical lower and upper bounds which individuate the entropy of entanglement of pure two - mode pss ( obtained from gaussian twin beams by conditional subtraction of @xmath0 photons per beam ) within a very narrow band , with relative error vanishing with increasing entanglement .",
    "the bandwidth is linked to the degree of non - gaussianity @xcite of the analyzed pss .",
    "the results are extended to bound the entanglement of formation of a class of mixed pss obtained by means of realistic `` on / off '' type photodetectors .",
    "crucially , all these bounds are only functions of the second moments of the non - gaussian states .",
    "a novel method for the fast and reliable reconstruction of the complete covariance matrix of optical two - mode cv states has been recently demonstrated @xcite : our result proves that it can be applied to real degaussified pss as well and it is enough to quantitatively estimate entanglement with surprisingly high accuracy .",
    "we deal with a cv system of @xmath1 bosonic modes , associated to an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 is the fock space of each individual mode @xmath4 , described by the ladder operators @xmath5 satisfying the canonical commutation relations @xmath6=\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "we can collect the field quadrature operators into the vector @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the exact description of a generic cv ( non - gaussian ) state requires arbitrary - order moments of the canonical operators . in general , the first moments @xmath10 can be adjusted by local displacements without affecting entanglement : they will be set to zero without loss of generality .",
    "two - mode gaussian states are henceforth completely specified by the @xmath11 real symmetric covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath12 of the second moments @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the cm elements for an arbitrary two - mode cv state can be efficiently reconstructed in the lab by means of homodyne detections @xcite .",
    "we recall that any physical two - mode cm @xmath14 can be converted by local unitaries into a standard form @xcite where @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 is universally quantified by the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of each subsystem ( entropy of entanglement @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "the optimal convex - roof extension of @xmath19 for a mixed state @xmath20 defines the entanglement of formation @xcite @xmath21 , where the infimum runs over all pure - state decompositions of @xmath22 .",
    "another popular measure of entanglement for pure and mixed states , whose computation is in general simpler , is the logarithmic negativity @xcite @xmath23 $ ] @xcite , where the partial transposition @xmath24 is obtained from @xmath20 by transposing the degrees of freedom of one subsystem only . for pure states @xmath25 .",
    "an important result in cv entanglement theory is the ` extremality ' of gaussian states : for any cv state @xmath20 with second moments given by @xmath26 , the corresponding gaussian state @xmath27 defined by the same cm has smaller entanglement ( quantified by a continuous and strongly superadditive measure ) than @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that for arbitrary two - mode gaussian states @xmath28 is computable , additive , and strongly superadditive @xcite .",
    "the starting point for the definition of `` ideal '' pss is a pure two - mode squeezed gaussian state ( or ` twin beam ' in the optical language ) , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and the positive @xmath31 is the squeezing degree .",

    "in most practical implementations , efficient photon - number - resolving detectors are not available and the conditional generation of pss is achieved by means of `` on / off '' type detectors which are only able to discriminate the vacuum from a bunch of an undefined number of photons @xcite .",

    "we plan to deepen our investigation in the future following the experimental progresses in the generation of ( generally non - symmetric ) pss states @xcite , thus properly modeling other sources of imperfections ( e.g. mismatches or dark counts in the photon conditioning ) that arise in practical demonstrations @xcite , in order to test the robustness and reliability of our techniques for estimating entanglement in fully realistic situations .    in this context ,",
