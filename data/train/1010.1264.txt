    "in a sense , ads / cft duality reduces the construction of quantum gravity to a solved problem .",
    "gravity is written in terms of a nongravitational quantum field theory  @xcite , and the technology of wilson  @xcite can then be applied . in its current form ,",
    "this duality reports only the measurements made by an external observer studying gravity confined to an anti - de sitter box .",
    "still , this allows one to address many of the conceptual questions of quantum gravity , most notably the purity of black hole hawking radiation .",
    "this implies in turn an extreme nonlocality of quantum gravity  @xcite . formulating a theory in which locality has been so radically abandoned is a great challenge .",
    "fortunately , we have the example of ads / cft duality , and so we should understand this example as fully as possible .",
    "in retrospect , what ads / cft describes are the simplest and most sharply defined observables possible in a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "one needs go beyond these , to describe local observers within ads space , and to understand gravity outside the ads box . in this paper",
    "we study a framework suggested by the discussion above , in which we pull the wilson renormalization group back through the duality , where it takes a holographic form . of course there is a wide literature that falls under the broad heading of _ holographic renormalization group ( hrg)_. however , the parallels between the wilson and holographic perspectives have not been fully developed , and there are some simple observations and exercises that we would like to add , although we will also leave many questions unanswered for now .",
    "many of the points that we make have already been made in various forms in the literature , but it is useful to bring together here a coherent point of view .",
    "although we have emphasized the use of the duality to understand quantum gravity , clarifying the relation between the rg s should also be useful in the applications to strongly coupled field theories .",
    "indeed , there is interesting overlap between some recent work in this area and ours .",
    "wilson separates the path integral into high- and low - energy modes , and integrates out the former , @xmath0 where we use @xmath1 for generic boundary fields .",
    "we are being impressionistic here : the precise form of the cutoff at scale @xmath2 is not specified .",
    "the progressive integration of momentum shells is then described by a differential equation , and by integrating out to @xmath3 one obtains the full path integral .",
    "the intermediate stages are quite complicated : @xmath4 is necessarily a quasilocal function of length scale @xmath5 , and so depends on an infinite number of parameters , but the flow is strongly convergent in almost all directions .",
    "in essence , this flow supplies the deltas and epsilons of path integration , reducing the construction of qft to dimensional analysis . in the spirit of full disclosure",
    "we should note that it is difficult to make the mode separation while preserving explicitly important structures such as gauge invariance , supersymmetry , and duality .",
    "ultimately this may point to the need for a new way to think about qft , but for now this is the only tool of broad applicability , enabling one to reduce arbitrary calculations to algorithms .    in ads / cft duality ,",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath6 of the ads bulk emerges from the energy scale of the boundary field theory  @xcite .",
    "this suggests a correspondence between radial evolution in the bulk and wilson renormalization group flow in the field theory . in sec .",
    "2 we develop this idea .",
    "our approach is to postulate a mapping between the radial cutoff on the bulk , and a wilsonian cutoff on the field theory . to make the form of this mapping precise is the deep and difficult problem that we would like to solve in the future , but for the present we are interested in the consequences of this postulate for the structures on the two sides .",
    "two somewhat unexpected results are the central role played by multi - trace operators , and the need to carry out the gravitational path integral in gauge - fixed rather than wheeler - dewitt form . in sec .",
    "3 we work out some examples , in particular the flows induced by relevant single- and double - trace operators , and also flows involving bulk gauge fields and the metric . in sec .  4",
    "we discuss various truncations of the full wilsonian flow and relations with the earlier literature . in sec .",
    "5 we discuss the picture from the boundary field theory point of view , and are led to a possible , but rather unusual , regulator . in sec .",
    "6 we discuss future directions and intended applications .",
    "in the bulk , our approach requires that we write the theory as a path integral over local fields .",
    "already this leads to some tension , as the wilsonian framework requires that we keep all operators in the theory , including those dual to stringy states , and so it is not clear whether such a local representation is possible .",
    "we will gloss over this point for now , and return to it in sec .",
    "an asymptotically @xmath7 metric can be written @xmath8 we use a lower - case @xmath9 for the lapse to distinguish it from the number of colors .",
    "some flows of interest involve large deformations of the spacetime , and so we must be must deal with the dynamics of the metric . in order to get oriented , however , we will first consider flows for which the backreaction is small , and so take the path integral in the fixed metric  ( [ adsmet ] ) , focussing for simplicity on scalar fields . separate the path integration over the fields @xmath10 into three parts , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 : @xmath14 here @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denotes the bulk action , while @xmath17 and also @xmath18 will be used for qft actions .",
    "the dependence of the full amplitude @xmath19 and of the uv piece @xmath20 on the choice of ads boundary conditions , including any sources , is left implicit .",
    "we keep track of @xmath21 ( which for @xmath22 is @xmath23 ) in anticipation of the classical limit , and we assume that @xmath24 is of supergravity type , by which we mean that with canonical normalization it is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "this radial separation resembles a wilsonian treatment of the dual field theory .",
    "in particular , it is natural to interpret the ir factor @xmath26 as the path integral in the dual qft with a uv cutoff  @xcite , on a length scale @xmath2 to be determined shortly , @xmath27 here @xmath28 are a complete set of local single trace operators built from the matrix fields @xmath1 and their derivatives .",
    "they are normalized @xmath29 where the ellipsis represents a product of the matrix fields and their derivatives .",
    "thus @xmath30 and @xmath31 are held fixed in the large-@xmath32 limit , and @xmath33 .",
    "it would be more standard to have a factor of @xmath34 in the exponent rather than @xmath35 , which is of the same order in @xmath32 , but this makes subsequent equations simpler .",
    "the action @xmath36 is included for generality , though one might absorb it into the definition of the measure .",
    "the linearity of the action in @xmath37 can be arranged by a bulk field redefinition .",
    "_ we take eq .",
    "( [ ir ] ) as a postulate , _ and explore its consequences .",
    "of course we would like to be explicit about the precise form of the cutoff @xmath2 and action @xmath36 .",
    "this is the hard question , whose solution would allow us to discuss local physics in the bulk . for now , though , we will simply assume this and see what it implies for the rest of the rg structure .    similarly , it is tempting to identify the uv factor @xmath38 with a wilsonian action , integrating out the fields above the cutoff scale .",
    "this action is not local , because propagating fields have been integrated out , but will fall exponentially beyond some length @xmath2 because the fields are confined to a finite range @xmath39 , and so there is a gap for propagation in the @xmath40 directions .",
    "this locality property has been discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath2 is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of a geodesic connecting two boundary points and hanging down to radius @xmath6 . the same order of magnitude is given by the extent in @xmath40 of the lightcone of a boundary point when it touches @xmath13 @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 .     on which the wilsonian action is localized . ]    [ deltafig ]    for a poincar invariant metric @xmath41 this is given by @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the proper distance , and we assume that , as in ads , @xmath44 grows rapidly toward the ir and so the integral can be estimated by the behavior near the upper limit . for pure ads space one",
    "simply has @xmath45 more generally , @xmath46 meaning that the proper length corresponding to the cutoff is of the order of the effective ads radius at the given scale .",
    "this is also consistent with one degree of freedom per planck area  @xcite , @xmath47 in terms of the @xmath48 dimensional planck length .",
    "the expansion in local terms thus involves an infinite number of parameters , as in the wilsonian action .    finally , in comparing the holographic and wilsonian structures  ( [ holosplit ] ) and ( [ wilsplit ] ) , what is the role of the functional integral over @xmath49 ?",
    "it appears that rather than a definite rg flow we have instead some weighted average over effective couplings .",
    "to get some insight , consider a single scalar , suppose that the uv factor is a local gaussian@xmath50 using the postulate  ( [ ir ] ) and carrying out the integral over @xmath37 gives @xmath51 thus we do obtain a definite effective action , but one that has double - trace as well as single - trace terms .",
    "more generally , we see that the wilsonian action is not @xmath52 directly , but rather an integral transform of it , @xmath53 the action @xmath54 has general multi - trace terms , and is localized on the scale @xmath2 .",
    "that renormalization group flow generically leads to multi - trace operators , and moreover that these contribute to connected correlators even in the planar limit , has been discussed in a number of situations .",
    "for example , in nonsupersymmetric orbifolds of the @xmath55 theory this was observed in refs .",
    "@xcite , while in the wilson rg context it was noted in refs .",
    "@xcite ; we will review the latter work in sec .  5 .",
    "nevertheless , it comes as a bit of a surprise , because most of the hrg literature focuses on flows within the space of single - trace couplings , and because of the apparently misplaced prejudice that single - trace actions are the norm in taking large-@xmath32 limits , with multi - trace actions arising in exotic applications such as refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the total amplitude is independent of the radius at which the division is made , @xmath56 where the angle brackets denote the matrix path integral  ( [ ir ] ) , and the derivative in the last form acts on both the cutoff and the action .",
    "the ` amplitudes ' @xmath57 evolve via radial schrdinger equations  @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "for example , for @xmath60 @xmath61    for the wilsonian action  ( [ wilson ] ) , the evolution equation becomes @xmath62 this is our main result , an equation that should be compared in form to that found in the qft . in the classical limit @xmath63",
    ", corresponding to the planar limit of the qft , this reduces to the hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) equation @xmath64    let @xmath65 be a complete set of local operators , including multi - traces .",
    "expand @xmath66 where we allow for position - dependent couplings so as to have a generating functional for correlators .",
    "then the rg equation  ( [ wilrg ] ) for the running is of the general form @xmath67 and the statement of invariance with respect to cutoff is @xmath68 where the partial derivative acts only on the cutoff .",
    "further , using functional derivatives to introduce the correlator @xmath69 we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 .    in this discussion , we have taken a euclidean metric , as is usual in studies of the renormalization group , but there appears to be no obstacle to having a lorentzian metric on the poincar slices .",
    "now we consider the general case , with dynamical metric . because the metric is fixed on the ads boundary one can in a neighborhood of the boundary fix the coordinates fully such that @xmath72 these fefferman - graham coordinates have been employed extensively in the holographic renormalization program of ref .  @xcite .",
    "once the coordinates are fixed , one can treat the @xmath73-dimensional metric @xmath74 on the same footing as the scalar fields .",
    "for pure einstein gravity we get the schrdinger equation @xmath75 with the upper sign for the uv and the lower sign for the ir .",
    "tildes again denote the field restricted to @xmath76 . here",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 is the intrinsic curvature of a fixed @xmath6 slice , and @xmath79    this approach may raise concerns on two points , stability and coordinate invariance .",
    "the fefferman - graham coordinates will in general break down at finite distance due to formation of caustics .",
    "this is actually exacerbated by the ads geometry : if we consider the radial geodesic @xmath80 , nearby geodesics @xmath81 diverge quadratically .",
    "we view this as an inessential complication .",
    "one can think of this coordinate system as defining the surface of given @xmath82 as the set of points of distance @xmath83 from the surface @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is in the asymptotic region  ( [ adsmet ] ) .",
    "the coordinates @xmath40 are then assigned on the @xmath82 surface according to the closest point on the @xmath85 surface . when there are caustics , the @xmath82 surface and the @xmath40 mapping are not smooth .",
    "it should be possible to smooth these , for example by defining the distance from the @xmath85 surface in terms of some average distance to a disk of radius @xmath6 .",
    "we leave the details for future work , hopefully by others with better geometric tools .    more substantively , by fixing completely the lapse and shift we have lost the corresponding equations of motion , so that the state @xmath20 does not satisfy the constraints of canonical gravity . in our approach",
    ", we are foliating the bulk according to the lapse from the @xmath85 surface , and the integral over uv metrics is constrained to those of given total lapse and zero shift . in the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) approach  @xcite , one would integrate over all metrics with given inner and outer boundary , and identify a radial variable according to some intrinsic property of the geometry .",
    "in this case the wavefunction would satisfy the constraints .    in most contexts it is the wdw wavefunction that is physical , but for the purpose of defining the wilsonian action it is the coordinate - fixed wavefunction that is appropriate .",
    "one sign of this is that the wdw wavefunction does not have the quasilocality expected of the wilsonian action , because the action for the metric component @xmath86 does not involve @xmath6-derivatives ; we will work out explicitly the corresponding effect for the bulk gauge field in sec .  3.2 .",
    "another reason that this can not work is that an ultralocal term in the metric would have to be of the form @xmath87 if the constraints are satisfied . on the other hand",
    ", the wilsonian action should contain arbitrarily ultralocal functions of @xmath88 , whose integral transform would be a correspondingly general function of @xmath89 .",
    "conceptually , the boundary qft action is not coordinate invariant , and so neither should the cutoff action obtained by integrating out high energy fields .",
    "note that in most applications of gaussian normal coordinates there is no natural surface on which to begin , and so one must impose the constraints . in ads",
    "space the boundary provides such a surface .    for the ir path integral ,",
    "there is no corresponding boundary surface and no condition to fix the coordinates globally .",
    "one is integrating over all metrics with given outer boundary , and so @xmath90 does satisfy the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "the equation of motion corresponding to the constraint , which is given by the matrix element of the constraint between @xmath90 and @xmath20 , is therefore satisfied .    as a result of the constraint",
    ", @xmath90 has no direct dependence on @xmath91 .",
    "rather , for given @xmath74 the ir path integral has an effective cutoff given by ( [ cutoff ] ) .",
    "insertions of the energy - momentum tensor are generated by derivatives with respect to @xmath74 , but we can not linearize as in the scalar case  ( [ ir ] ) .",
    "the rg equation is @xmath92 when the metric is approximately classical , the uv amplitude will be peaked at a metric @xmath93 .",
    "this defines the cutoff  ( [ cutoff ] ) , and the integration over fluctuatations around @xmath93 generates multitrace interactions involving the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "incidentally , if one has a metric of finite total lapse in the ir direction , as with massive deformations of the qft , most foliations will eventually break down .",
    "here there is a physical origin : when we pass through a massive threshold we must recast the rg in terms of new degrees of freedom appropriate to that scale .",
    "more generally , the monotonicity of the energy with radius will break down , for example in multi - throated solutions corresponding to breaking of @xmath94 to a product of smaller @xmath95 s , and in semi - holographic situations where there are massless degrees of freedom in a region of finite warp factor  @xcite .",
    "again , these represent thresholds in the rg .",
    "it is interesting to work out in detail the case of a single free scalar , in the limit that backreaction is negligible .",
    "we work in units @xmath96 , and take a poincar invariant background , so @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 \\bigr\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] we further assume that the amplitudes are gaussian , @xmath100 in the ir this follows dynamically , while in the uv it is an assumption about the initial conditions on the flow , which could be relaxed .",
    "we have allowed for a possible translation - breaking source for the linear term , but not for the quadratic one : the subscript @xmath101 is for fourier components of fields and sources , while the argument @xmath101 is for kernels .",
    "then @xmath102 with the upper sign for the uv and the lower sign for the ir . for the normalization constant , @xmath103 \\,.\\ ] ] for this quadratic system",
    "the full schrdinger equation differs from the hj equation only by the @xmath104 term in @xmath105 .",
    "the center of the gaussian , @xmath106 , is not a solution to the bulk field equation , but it and @xmath107 can be written @xmath108 where @xmath109 does solve the massive klein - gordon equation @xmath110 we now specialize to the case of pure ads , @xmath111 , for which @xmath112 is a bessel function of order @xmath113 .",
    "it is convenient to write it as @xmath114 in terms of@xmath115 we will need a different prescription , below . ]",
    "@xmath116 the set of flows is thus parameterized by two functions @xmath117 , @xmath118 .",
    "first let us cast the evolution equations in the form of an rg flow . according to eq .",

    "the standard conformal quantization is @xmath132 and the alternate conformal quantization is @xmath133 .",
    "recall that for @xmath134 only the standard quantization gives a unitary theory all the way into the uv , so we focus on @xmath135 ; we could also consider the flow at general @xmath136 in an effective theory with a maximum uv scale .",
    "the uv boundary conditions on the fields are generally parameterized as @xmath137 our restriction to gaussian @xmath20 implies a linear relation @xmath138 in order to relate this parameterization to the general flow above , we can directly evaluate the path integral , which is extremized by @xmath139 , which has the asymptotic behavior  ( [ asymp ] ) at @xmath140 and is equal to @xmath37 at @xmath76 .",

    "the uv amplitude depends only on @xmath146 and its derivative , and on the initial data @xmath150 .",
    "therefore if the latter are are localized ( analytic around @xmath151 ) then so is the wilsonian action , as expected .",
    "we can then expand @xmath152 then @xmath153 is the coefficient of @xmath154 in the lagrangian .",
    "the rg equation becomes @xmath155 note that the equation for @xmath153 involves on the right only @xmath156 with @xmath157 , allowing an iterative solution .",
    "this iterative structure in the momentum expansion is a property of the planar limit in the interacting case as well .",
    "the infrared amplitude solves the evolution equations  ( [ fphi ] ) with the lower sign . in the path integral , the condition that the classical solution not blow up as @xmath158 fixes @xmath159 so @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "the amplitude is @xmath162    to see how the rg acts on this , we have from  ( [ ir ] ) @xmath163 in terms of the action @xmath164 with single- and double - trace couplings . at @xmath165",
    "we simply have @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the rg  ( [ rg ] ) then takes the form @xmath168 the integrand of the second term on the right can be rewritten @xmath169 and so we recover the schrdinger equation . in the hj approximation ,",
    "the rhs becomes @xmath170    the ir amplitude is generated by integrating out long wavelengths , and so is not localized .",
    "using @xmath171 , we have @xmath172 in the asymptotic expansion at small @xmath101 , one obtains terms of the form @xmath173 .",
    "the local part , defined by the terms of the form @xmath174 , is @xmath175 this has no particular relation to the uv amplitude , which is also local , since the latter depends on the uv boundary conditions . in identifying the local part ,",
    "we have ignored additional integer powers that appear when @xmath136 is rational ; for more general flows , picking out an part analytic in @xmath101 may not be well defined .",
    "however , the ultralocal @xmath176 term is unambiguous if @xmath177 , and in the present case is just @xmath178 the leading nonlocal behavior at small @xmath101 is @xmath179      our next example is a bulk @xmath180 gauge field @xmath181 in a fixed poincar invariant background geometry , which must couple to a conserved current @xmath182 in the boundary theory .",
    "integrating by parts along the @xmath183 directions the action can be written @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a projection operator .",
    "we will first deal with the gauge symmetry by fixing radial gauge , @xmath186 .",
    "normally this leaves a residual invariance under @xmath6-independent gauge transformations , but in ads space the gauge parameter is required to vanish at the boundary ( in the cft the @xmath180 is a global symmetry ) , so the gauge symmetry is fully fixed .",
    "we can then write a hamiltonian directly @xmath187 giving the ( momentum - space ) schrodinger equation @xmath188 where the upper / lower sign is for the .",
    "the schrdinger equation separates in the longitudinal and transverse variables @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191    we first obtain @xmath20 by direct evaluation of the path integral with @xmath192 and @xmath193 fixed .",
    "the latter is the same as the classical gauge field coupled to the the equations of motion in radial gauge reduce to @xmath194 the transverse part obeys the scalar klein - gordon equation  ( [ bulkkg ] ) with the replacements @xmath195 and @xmath196 , while the longitudinal part is given by @xmath197 the classical action is then @xmath198 the longitudinal part is @xmath199 the transverse part is @xmath200 where @xmath201 here @xmath202 is the solution to the massive klein - gordon equation at @xmath203 and @xmath204 such that @xmath205 .",
    "it is clear from the path integral construction that the total classical action is localized in the boundary values of the fields .",
    "this is not manifest in the final form , because the projection @xmath206 makes the transverse and longitudinal pieces separately nonlocal : each piece separately is @xmath207 times an analytic function of @xmath208 , and a generic solution to the schrdinger equation would be nonlocal .",
    "one can verify that the pole cancels in the sum by noting that at @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 is identically 1 , so that the nonderivative part of the action is simply @xmath212 the integral transform , which is the wilsonian action , therefore contains a a @xmath213 term and an @xmath214 term .",
    "if we had fixed @xmath215 to some generic functional form , then by a gauge transformation we can see that the action would be the same as above with the replacement @xmath216 if we integrated freely over @xmath215 , the result would be a gauge volume times an integral over @xmath217 , with a result independent of @xmath218 .",
    "that is , the uv amplitude would now satisfy the constraint @xmath219 in canonical quantization , one would normally be interested only in such physical states , but for our purposes this can not give rise to a wilsonian action : eliminating the dependence on @xmath218 necessarily leaves the amplitude nonlocal . effectively , the wilson action must remember that the @xmath180 symmetry was a global symmetry in the uv , not a gauge symmetry .",
    "all of these observations are parallel to our discussion of the coordinate choice in sec .  2.2 : the radial gauge has the same properties as the gaussian normal gauge , and gives rise to a wavefunction that does not satisfy the constraints , but gives a wilson action with the expected properties .",
    "the @xmath215-integrated amplitude is analogous to the wheeler - dewitt wavefunction and does not lead to a local action .",
    "the longitudinal part of the ir amplitude is @xmath220 when there is a horizon ( @xmath221 ) then @xmath222 and the longitudinal part vanishes ( except for @xmath223 , but this is a rather special case ) .",
    "when there is a mass gap ( so @xmath82 is finite ) , @xmath224 is finite but we must integrate over the gauge field on the lower boundary , and the longitudinal amplitude is again trivial . thus the ir amplitude always satisfies the constraint .",
    "now we consider an interacting scalar theory , taking for simplicity a single field . in this subsection",
    "we assume that the backreaction on the metric is small , in the next we discuss its inclusion .",
    "we focus on the momentum - independent terms in the action .",
    "these satisfy closed equations , as we have already seen in the example  ( [ momex ] ) . thus , writing @xmath225 we have the hj equation @xmath226 suppose that @xmath227 has a stationary point @xmath228 , @xmath229 then there are scale invariant solutions @xmath230 where @xmath231 note that the equation for @xmath232 is independent of the other @xmath233 , and quadratic .",
    "this just produces the standard and alternate quantizations , subject to the usual restrictions .",
    "the remaining equations then determine the higher @xmath233 iteratively .",
    "flows that approach one of the extrema of @xmath227 in the uv correspond to perturbations by relevant operators .",
    "much of the literature on the holographic renormalization group focuses on flows that interpolate between different extrema of @xmath227 . in our framework",
    ", we look for a solution of the form @xmath234 this form is redundant , because @xmath235 can be set to an arbitrary function by redefinition of the @xmath236 s , but it is useful to present it in this way .",
    "taylor expanding the hj equation around @xmath228 gives @xmath237 the first three equations are @xmath238    we can obtain the same iterative structure  ( [ iter ] ) as in the conformal case if we fix the redundancy noted above by requiring @xmath239 the @xmath240 equation is then independent of @xmath232 , and requires that @xmath241 satisfies the classical field equation , @xmath242 in the equations for the higher @xmath233 , the next term @xmath243 enters multiplied by @xmath244 , so each successive equation closes .    for the case of a domain wall solution  @xcite ,",
    "where @xmath228 approaches distinct extrema of @xmath227 at @xmath245 , this asymptotes to the conformal solution at each end .",

    "it is important to note that this greatly changes the form of the rg .",
    "for example , in the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite , the full rg contains only a tree level term which is quadratic in the couplings , and a one - loop term which is linear in the couplings , and these are explicitly known .",
    "the renormalizable flow , on the other hand , contains terms of all orders in the coupling , which must be calculated order by order . to see how this comes about , consider the model equations  @xcite @xmath275 here @xmath276 is a nearly marginal coupling , and @xmath277 is irrelevant . as we flow toward the ir the latter approaches a value that depends only on @xmath276 and not on the initial conditions . in this simple example",

    "there is a set of operators whose dimensions are of order one , dual to states whose masses are of order the ads scale , and there are operators whose dimensions are parametrically large , dual to string scale ( or heavier ) states .",
    "these ultra - high dimension fields represent directions in which the flow is converging extremely rapidly , and one can project onto the relatively slower flow of operators of dimension @xmath282 . in the bulk , this corresponds to truncating to the effective supergravity theory including the dependence of the fields on the compact directions ( when these are at the ads scale ) .",
    "indeed , our whole framework of separating the bulk path integral radially into two parts is much more natural in this effective theory than in the full string theory .",

    "the formal structure that we have developed in this paper will be useful only if we can give meaning to the relation  ( [ ir ] ) between the cutoffs in the bulk and the gauge theory .",
    "of course , already on the gauge theory side it is intricate to construct a continuum cutoff that respects the gauge symmetry  @xcite ; extended supersymmetry and dualities are also mangled in the wilson framework . as a final calculation in this paper , we would like to note that the wilsonian holographic rg suggests a new approach to this problem .",
    "if we begin with the cutoff amplitude @xmath26 in the bulk , whose precise cft dual is to be determined , we could try to use the schrdinger evolution  ( [ evolve ] ) @xmath310 to express this in terms of @xmath311 ; for simplicity we are looking at the case that the backreaction is small . taking the limit @xmath312",

    "a higher covariant derivative regulator would correspond to adding higher derivative single - trace terms , but of course this does not work in yang - mills theory .",
    "the alternate quantization corresponds to adding double - trace terms , which begin at quartic order in the matrix fields and so do not affect the propagator directly . in a sense we are treating the theory with alternate quantization as a starting point , and using its deformations to define the cutoff theory . theory ( with standard quantization ) as a starting point for defining wilsonian regulators of theories of less symmetry .",
    "it may be that one should revise the wilsonian strategy along these lines .",
    "] we should note that the required step of running the rg backwards raises suspicions , though the theory with alternate quantization is actually an attractor for this flow in almost all directions , since most single - trace operators get negative dimensions .",
    "we leave further exploration of this idea for later work .",
    "we have identified structural parallels between the wilson and holographic rg s .",
    "the hope is that this will give a framework for making precise the connection  ( [ ir ] ) between the cutoff theories , pursuing the various parallels we have noted .",
    "the general direction of this work , if it succeeds , is to produce a more local version of holography , where the boundary is pulled into the bulk . of course , the radial slicing is not locally special , and so it should then be possible to discuss more general subregions of the bulk , with some sort of equivalence principle relating different slicings .",
    "possibly a more modest goal is to extend the results of ref .",
