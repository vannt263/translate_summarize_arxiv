    "the reader can refer to this joint paper to have more details about mose .",
    "we only recall here that the mose project aims at proving the feasibility of the forecast of the most relevant classical atmospherical parameters for astronomical applications ( wind speed intensity and direction , temperature , relative humidity ) and the optical turbulence ot ( @xmath0 profiles ) with the integrated astro - climatic parameters derived from the @xmath0 i.e. the seeing ( @xmath10 ) , the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath2 ) , the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath3 ) above the two eso sites of cerro paranal ( site of the very large telescope - vlt ) and cerro armazones ( site selected for the european extremely large telescope - e - elt ) .",
    "+ the final outcome of the project is to investigate the opportunity to implement an automatic system for the forecast of these parameters at the vlt observatory at cerro paranal and at the e - elt observatory at cerro armazones .",
    "+   + the meso - nh model has already successfully been used to investigate some atmospherical parameters above sites of interest for the astronomy : at roque de los muchachos ( near ground temperature , @xcite ) ; at san pedro martir ( wind speed profiles , @xcite ) ; at cerro paranal in chile and maidanak in uzbekistan ( near ground wind speed , @xcite ) ; in antarctica ( wind speed and temperature profiles at dome c , @xcite ) ; at mount graham , arizona ( wind speed vertical distribution , @xcite and use of the meso - nh wind speed for wavefront coherence time reconstruction , @xcite ) . in the present study , we focus our analysis on the model ability in reconstructing the meteorological surface parameters ( temperature , wind speed and direction ) , from the ground up to 30  m a.  g.  l , at cerro paranal and cerro armazones . in section 2",

    "we just recall here the use of the grid - nesting technique @xcite , that consists in using different imbricated domains of the digital elevation models ( dem i.e orography ) extended on smaller and smaller surfaces , with increasing horizontal resolution but with the same vertical grid . in this study",
    "we use two different configurations .",
    "the first grid - nesting configuration employed three domains ( fig .",

    "we have 62 levels distributed as follows : a first vertical grid point equal to 5  m , a logarithmic stretching of 20  @xmath19 up to 3.5  km above the ground , and an almost constant vertical grid size of @xmath5600  m up to 23.8  km .",
