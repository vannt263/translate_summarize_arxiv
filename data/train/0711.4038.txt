    "in a now widely accepted evolutionary sequence based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the infrared , there are four stages in the pre - main - sequence life of a low - mass star : class 0 objects are deeply embedded protostars with large submillimeter to bolometric luminosity ratios , which are very faint at near - infrared wavelengths ; class i objects are surrounded by infalling envelopes , but are less embedded ; class ii objects have cleared their envelopes and are surrounded by accretion disks ; and class iii objects have dispersed almost all of their circumstellar material @xcite .",
    "therefore , class i protostars are thought to be in one of the earliest evolutionary stages .",
    "after the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core starts , the infalling material forms an envelope around the central object .",
    "since cloud cores are usually rotating slowly , the material falls preferentially onto a disk , which serves as a mass reservoir , most of which is eventually accreted by the protostar .",
    "class i objects are thus surrounded by accretion disks , in addition to envelopes extending to several 1000 au .",
    "the radius of the disk is roughly equal to the centrifugal radius ( @xmath1 ) , which defines the centrifugal barrier encountered by matter falling in on the equatorial plane , if the specific angular momentum is conserved ; inside this radius the density distribution flattens , and the matter follows non - radial trajectories , falling onto a disk .",
    "material tends to accumulate close to @xmath1 , which is close to the protostar at the beginning of the collapse , but increases rapidly over time @xcite .",
    "besides accreting matter , young stars generate powerful outflows which are launched along magnetic field lines ; mass accretion onto the star and mass loss in the form of outflows seem to be correlated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to collimated outflows , protostars might also emit a wide - angle wind , which is expected to open up cavities in the envelope @xcite .",
    "the presence of both collimated outflows and wide - angle stellar winds explains the fact that some objects with large cavities have well - collimated outflows .",
    "a partially evacuated cavity also forms as a natural by - product of the collapse of a sheet @xcite ; since molecular cloud cores are rarely spherically symmetric , this scenario might be more realistic .",
    "in some cases , both stellar winds and the flattening of the envelope are responsible for cavities oriented along the rotational axis of a protostar .    the spectral index @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) from 2 to 25 @xmath0 m is used for the sed classification of protostars and pre - main - sequence stars @xcite",
    "; class i objects have @xmath4 , class ii objects have @xmath5 , and class iii objects have @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the spectral index of a photosphere in the rayleigh - jeans limit ) .",
    "therefore , class i objects are characterized by a strong infrared excess ; the dust in the envelope absorbs radiation from the central protostar and disk and reemits it at infrared to mm wavelengths .",
    "the peak of the sed of this type of objects usually lies in the mid- to far - infrared , depending on the density of the envelope ( and thus mass and infall rate ) , as well as the source luminosity @xcite .",
    "flat spectrum sources are likely objects surrounded by envelopes and disks and therefore protostars , but with wide cavities in their envelopes and/or seen close to pole - on ( e.g. , dg tau , t tau ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . some of the flat - spectrum sources could be transition objects ( class i / ii ) , consisting of a t tauri star and its disk surrounded by remnant envelope material ( e.g. , iras 04154 + 2823 ) .",
    "their seds typically show a double peak , one centered in the near - ir and one in the far - ir .",
    "in addition to a rising sed in the infrared due to this excess emission , class i protostars display various absorption features in their near- and mid - infrared spectra due to silicates and ices in the envelope .",
    "however , many parts of the infrared spectrum are not accessible from ground - based telescopes , which in addition often lack the sensitivity to observe faint objects .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite opened a new window onto low - mass star formation ; with unprecedented sensitivity , the precursors of low - mass stars can be studied in various evolutionary stages .",
    "here we present 28 spectra from 5 to 36 @xmath0 m of class i objects in the taurus star - forming region observed with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board of _ spitzer_. the 520 @xmath0 m spectra of 5 of the 28 class i objects were already introduced in @xcite ; these objects are iras 04016 + 2610 , 04108 + 2803b , 04181 + 2654 b , 04239 + 2436 , and dg tau b. our irs observations are part of a larger infrared spectrograph guaranteed - time observing program ; we presented the class ii and iii objects from our sample of 150 young stellar objects in taurus in an earlier paper @xcite .    since the taurus - auriga star - forming region is young ( 12 myr ) and relatively nearby ( 140 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , many of its objects have been fairly well - studied at wavelengths covering almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum . here",
    "we use seds constructed with data from the literature and our irs spectra to constrain envelope models and to determine which parameters describe the circumstellar environment of the class i objects in our sample .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in   [ obs_data_reduction ] we lay out our _ spitzer _ irs observations and data reduction ; in    [ sample ]",
    "we present the irs spectra and seds of the 28 class i objects in our sample ; in   [ env_models ] we describe the envelope models used to fit 22 of our class i objects and give detailed descriptions of the individual model fits ; in   [ discussion ] we discuss the different appearances of class i objects and give a summary of our models ; and in   [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "our taurus targets were observed with the irs on _ spitzer _ during irs observing campaigns 3 ( 2004 february 6 to 8) , 4 ( 2004 february 27 to march 5 ) , 12 ( 2004 august 30 to 31 ; only 3 targets ) , and 24 ( 2005 september 12 ; only iras 04166 + 2706 ) .",
    "all targets were observed over the full irs range from 5 to 40 @xmath0 m by using either the two low - resolution irs modules ( short - low [ sl ] and long - low [ ll ] , 5.214 @xmath0 m and 1438 @xmath0 m , respectively , @xmath8/@xmath9 @xmath10 90 ) or the sl module and the two high - resolution modules ( short - high [ sh ] and long - high [ lh ] , 1019 @xmath0 m and 1937 @xmath0 m , respectively , @xmath8/@xmath9 @xmath10 600 ) , depending on the object s expected mid - infrared flux .",
    "thus , roughly half of our class i objects were observed with sl and ll , and the other half with sl , sh , and lh . our observations were carried out either in irs staring mode , where the target is placed on two nod positions along the slit , at 1/3 and 2/3 of the slit length , or in mapping mode , with @xmath11 step maps on the target ( 3 steps in the dispersion direction and 2 steps in the spatial direction ) .",
    "more than half of the objects ( 19 out of 28 ) were observed in mapping mode .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the smart software tool @xcite .",
    "spectra were extracted after bad pixels , including so - called rogue pixels , were fixed by interpolation and after the sky in the low - resolution spectra was subtracted using the off - order observation ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "a variable - width column extraction was performed for low - resolution spectra , while high - resolution spectra were extracted using a full - slit extraction .",
    "the spectra were calibrated by dividing them by a calibrator spectrum ( @xmath12 lac ( a1 v ) for low - resolution and @xmath13 dra ( k2 iii ) for high - resolution observations ) , and by multiplying the result by the calibrator s template spectrum @xcite .",
    "final spectra were obtained by averaging the two nod positions ( for staring mode observations ) or the two central map positions ( for mapping mode observations ) .",
    "we also truncated all sh spectra below 13 @xmath0 m and rebinned all high - resolution spectra to a resolution of @xmath8/@xmath9 = 200 to achieve a more uniform representation of the spectra .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , we applied scalar corrections to each lh spectrum to account for the absence of sky subtraction in the high - resolution modules .",
    "some minor adjustments ( @xmath14 10% ) were also necessary for sl to match it to the flux level of sh .",
    "for iras 04154 + 2823 , 04158 + 2805 ,",
    "04325 + 2402 , and 04368 + 2557 , a multiplicative factor of 1.2 had to be applied to sl , while dg tau b is the only class i object in our sample to require an even larger scaling : a multiplication by 1.35 of sl2 ( 5.27.5 @xmath0 m ) and by 1.21 of sl1 ( 7.414 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the flux mismatches between short- and long - wavelength modules can be attributed to the extended nature of our targets ; even though all objects in our sample appeared as point sources when observed with the irs , we know that most of our targets are somewhat extended due to the presence of an envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are two effects caused by the extension of the envelope influencing our irs observations .",
    "first , the ll and lh slits , which are 10.6  and 11.1  wide , respectively , cover a larger area and thus more of the envelope emission than the sl and sh slits , which are 3.6  and 4.7  wide , respectively .",
    "however , the cold , outer envelope regions do not contribute much flux at the irs wavelengths ; at a distance of 140 pc , the sl slit encompasses all emission within 250 au from the central source , while lh includes emission out to 780 au , sufficient to sample almost all of the material contributing to the irs spectrum .",
    "only a few objects probably suffer from slit losses beyond about 30 @xmath0 m , evidenced by a change in slope , and thus decrease in flux level , around 30 @xmath0 m ; this effect is most notable in iras 04108 + 2803 b , 04158 + 2805 , 04181 + 2654 a , 04239 + 2436 , and 04295 + 2251 .",
    "second , and more importantly , is the fact that protostellar envelopes are usually not spherically symmetric and that each of the irs modules sample different regions of a protostellar system , since the slits of the various modules are not aligned parallel to each other and are also of different sizes ( see , e.g. , fig .   [ dgtaub_slits ] ) .",
    "for example , a protostar seen edge - on might show a dark central lane representing the disk and symmetric reflection nebulae representing inner envelope regions ; if sl is aligned along the disk , ll will be oriented perpendicular to the dark lane and will sample more of the envelope emission .",
    "the larger scalar correction factors applied to some of class i objects in our sample ( especially in the case of dg tau b ) are likely due to this second effect .",
    "in particular , the centering and orientation of the narrow sl slit could result in some of the envelope emission being missed by the sl observation ( see fig.[dgtaub_slits ] ) . however , in most cases only a small fraction of the warm dust contributing at irs wavelengths is not included in the irs observations , and therefore the spectra we obtained are believed to be a good representation of the mid - infrared emission of the inner envelope regions .",
    "our absolute spectrophotometric accuracy is of the order of 510% , depending on the module used and the pointing uncertainty .",
    "the relative spectral accuracy is module - dependent ; spectral features above the noise level are likely real in sl , ll2 ( 1421 @xmath0 m ) and sh , while in ll1 ( 2036 @xmath0 m ) and especially in lh artifacts from unresolved calibration issues often do not allow reliable identifications of spectral features .",
    "also the wavelength region where sl and ll meet ( 13.514.5 @xmath0 m ) is affected by this higher uncertainty due to possible artifacts at the order edges .    some of the class i objects we observed with irs are members of multiple systems ( see table [ tab_properties ] ) . except for gv tau",
    "a and b , they either are at separations that place all members well within the irs slits , or their separations are large enough to ensure that only one component is observed . since the infrared emission from protostars",
    "is dominated by envelope emission , the multiplicity of the central source should have no impact on the mid - infrared spectrum , except when the configuration of the system is such that it influences the emission from the envelope , e.g. , by truncating it or causing a departure from spherical symmetry in the illuminating radiation field .",
    "we encountered reduction problems in a few objects ; they are listed below . +",
    "_ 04108 + 2803b .",
    "_ this object is part of a mispointed mapping - mode observation ; by using the spectra from the central map position for sl and sh and scaled spectra from the third map position for lh , we created a continuous irs spectrum . this stitching adds a higher uncertainty to the absolute flux level in our spectra , but the overall shape of the spectrum should be only minimally affected .",
    "+ _ gv tau ( a , b ) .",
    "_ this binary is only separated by 13 ; it was observed with sl , sh , and lh in mapping mode , and it was not resolved in any of the modules . since this object consists of two point sources with likely some extended emission surrounding them , their sh and lh calibration presented some problems .",
    "the final spectrum was composed by using those nod and map positions for each module in which the flux was highest , and in addition sh was scaled to match up with sl . due to this procedure , the absolute flux level of this spectrum carries a higher uncertainty .",
    "in fact , we multiplied the entire spectrum by 0.85 to match fluxes at 11.7 and 17.9 @xmath0 m with our , yet unpublished , ground - based measurements at these wavelengths .",
    "+ _ hh 30 .",
    "_ this object was too faint in sl2 ; the spectrum could only be extracted in sl1 and in ll .",
    "+ _ lkha 358 . _",
    "the peak - up arrays contained bright to saturated sources during the sl observations , which resulted in increased noise in the sl part of the spectrum .",
    "the ll observation included 3 sources , lkha 358 , hl tau , and xz tau , but since the observation was centered on lkha 358 , the other two sources entered only partially in the slit .",
    "in addition , all three sources were separated sufficiently in the spatial direction to allow extraction of the individual spectrum of lkha 358 .",
    "our taurus sample is based on objects analyzed by @xcite ( from here on kh95 ) ; a large fraction of our class i targets has identifiers from the _ iras _ point source catalogue , since these objects were first identified as possible embedded protostars in the _ iras _ surveys and confirmed in follow - up observations .",
    "some objects that are part of our class i sample are identified as class ii objects in kh95 : these objects are iras 04154 + 2823 , 04158 + 2805 , 04278 + 2253 , coku tau/1 , hl tau , ic 2087 ir , and lkha 358 .",
    "we base our identification of these sources as class i objects on the existence of extended , near - infrared nebulosity and possibly outflows around these objects , or the presence of a silicate absorption feature and a positive spectral index over the irs range , or the detection of ice absorption features in the 58 @xmath0 m region as well as the co@xmath15 ice feature at 15.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , this sample includes all taurus objects we observed with the irs that are thought to be at the protostellar evolutionary stage and therefore surrounded , to varying extents , by envelopes , even though in a few cases the sed slope does not lie in the typical range for class i objects .",
    "figure [ classi_irs ] shows the irs spectra of the 28 class i objects in our sample .",
    "most have seds that are rising over the irs spectral range , and almost all of them show numerous absorption features in their mid - infrared spectra , typical of embedded protostars : wide bands due to amorphous silicates at 9.7 and 18 @xmath0 m ( the latter one is much less prominent ) , and features at 6.0 @xmath0 m due to h@xmath15o ice , at 15.2 @xmath0 m due to co@xmath15 ice , and at 6.8 @xmath0 m due to organic compounds , possibly ch@xmath16oh , nh@xmath17 , or strongly polar h@xmath15o ice @xcite .",
    "in addition , the silicate absorption feature at 9.7 @xmath0 m often displays a wider absorption shoulder at the longer - wavelength end due to the broad h@xmath15o ice libration band at @xmath10 11 - 13 @xmath0 m .",
    "the long - wavelength wing of the co@xmath15 ice feature also suggests that water ice is responsible , likely in the form of a mix with co@xmath15 ice @xcite .",
    "some protostars show an obvious self - absorbed silicate feature at 10 @xmath0 m ( e.g. , iras 04154 + 2823 , 04181 + 2654 b ; see fig .",
    "[ classi_irs]d ) , where the silicate emission from inner disk regions is absorbed in cooler envelope regions , causing a feature that is more or less flat , with some emission and some absorption characteristics @xcite .",
    "the self - absorbed features probably indicate that the optical depth of the envelope along the line of sight is not as large as for the cases where a clear silicate absorption feature is seen .",
    "iras 04248 + 2612 , 04264 + 2433 , and coku tau/1 ( fig .",
    "[ classi_irs]e ) have a silicate emission feature , but are surrounded by nebulosities and have an overall rising sed in the infrared .",
    "therefore , they are likely more evolved class i objects seen through low - density envelopes , which have mostly dispersed and thus reveal the central star and its accretion disk .",
    "based on the geometry of their near - infrared reflection nebulae , iras 04248 + 2612 and coku tau/1 are likely seen close to edge - on @xcite .",
    "most protostars are found near or are embedded within dense molecular cloud cores @xcite .",
    "due to high extinction mostly due to their envelopes , protostars are usually faint or even undetectable in the optical . in the near - infrared and in the optical , the infalling envelope often appears as a reflection nebula , seen in light scattered by dust grains in the inner parts of envelope cavities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , class i objects are often extended in the sub - mm and mm @xcite ; at these wavelengths , the thermal emission from cold dust in the envelope is detected .    to show the emission from protostellar systems at all wavelengths , in particular how the emitted power is distributed at different wavelengths , we generated spectral energy distributions with data from the literature . in figure",
    "[ classi_sed ] , we show the seds of the class i objects in our sample , constructed with optical to mid - ir photometry mostly from @xcite , the 2mass @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 fluxes , the _ iras _ 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath0 m fluxes , irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m fluxes @xcite , sub - mm and mm fluxes , where available , and the irs spectrum .",
    "the _ iras _ fluxes are mostly from the _ iras _ faint source catalog ; for coku tau/1 , gv tau , hl tau , and l1551 irs 5 we adopted the _ iras _ fluxes from @xcite , and for the 12 and 25 @xmath0 m fluxes of dg tau b and hh 30 the measurements from coadded _ iras _",
    "scans by @xcite .",
    "the fluxes at 350 , 450 , 800 , 850 , 1100 , and 1300 @xmath0 m are mostly from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , while the few measurements at 160 @xmath0 m were taken by @xcite with the kuiper airborne observatory ( see table [ tab_longwave ] for a list of the long - wavelength data used in the sed plots ) .",
    "the fluxes were not corrected for reddening , since the high extinction of these objects is very likely intrinsic .",
    "the sed plots show that most of the power of a class i object is emitted in the mid- to far - infrared ; therefore , for many objects the irs spectrum lies close to the peak of the emission . for most objects ,",
    "the sed is either rising or flat over the irs spectral range , with a deep silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m as the most notable spectral feature .",
    "only a few objects have seds that seem to peak at @xmath10 5 @xmath0 m and decrease over the irs spectral range ; they might be more evolved protostars and will be discussed in ",
    "[ special_obj ] .",
    "_ this object , also known as haro 6 - 10 , consists of two components separated by 13 . like t tau ,",

    "gv tau b is likely responsible for the outflows measured from this source @xcite . in the near - ir ,",
    "the brightness ratio of the components varies considerably over the timescale of a few years @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the b component , which is more deeply embedded , varies more than the a component in brightness and generates the deep 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature , as well as the various ice features , observed in its mid - ir spectrum ( see figure [ classi_irs]c ) .",
    "_ optical and near - ir hst images @xcite reveal that this object is seen edge - on ; the central star illuminates a flared circumstellar disk , which obscures the protostar and is seen in scattered light .",

    "its appearance is reminiscent of that of dg tau b , which is also seen edge - on and emits a jet .",
    "@xcite modeled the emission of hh 30 and concluded that , in addition to a disk , only a tenuous envelope is required .",
    "the presence of a diffuse infalling envelope , as well as outflows , indicates that hh 30 is a protostar , though likely more evolved .",
    "+ the _ iras _ fluxes of hh 30 , determined by @xcite from coadded _",

    "hh 30 is among the faintest objects in our taurus sample ; its irs spectrum suggests the presence of a deep silicate absorption feature , but its sed is only poorly determined .      as indicated in ",
    "[ sed_section ] , a few objects in our sample have seds that are not typical of protostars .",

    "@xcite measured the 10 @xmath0 m spectrum of ic 2087 ir ; they noted a strong silicate absorption feature on a decreasing photosphere - like continuum .",
    "the absorption features we detect in the irs spectrum of ic 2087 ir , and the fact that it is surrounded by a reflection nebulosity ( ic 2087 ) , suggest that it is actually a protostar , surrounded by an accretion disk and some envelope material .",
    "further evidence for its earlier evolutionary stage are a molecular outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the presence of two herbig - haro knots , which are not within the outflow , but are oriented along the axis of symmetry of the reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that , since ic 2087 ir has a rather weak outflow , it could be in transition between the embedded protostellar and the t tauri phase @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ic 2087 ir , iras 04278 + 2253 shows no silicate absorption feature , only a weak co@xmath15 ice feature , and likely gas absorption features in the 58 @xmath0 m wavelength range , most prominently an h@xmath15o band centered at 5.7 @xmath0 m .",
    "this feature , similar to what is observed in some fu ori objects @xcite , is thought to arise in the upper layers of hot inner disk regions that are heated by accretion .",
    "iras 04278 + 2253 is a 68 binary , whose primary component is of g8 spectral type and has a relatively high mass accretion rate ( @xmath22 m@xmath23 yr@xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary is of k7/m0 spectral type @xcite and thus clearly fainter than the primary . given this object s relatively large mass accretion rate , it is likely still a protostar , but since no extended emission has been detected around it , there is likely only little envelope material left .",
    "lkha 358 forms a small cluster of stars together with hl tau and xz tau ( a flat - spectrum source , see @xcite ) : all three objects are found within a radius of less than 1 .",
    "all of them are likely embedded to some extent ; while hl tau has an obvious absorption feature and an sed typical of a class i object , lkha 358 only has a weak absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m , and xz tau has silicate emission features at 10 and 20 @xmath0 m and an overall flat sed in the mid - ir . since hl tau is the brightest source of the group , it is likely the dominating contribution to the iras source 04287 + 1807 ; therefore , the _ iras _ fluxes for lkha 358 are not known .",
    "the irs spectrum shows that lkha 358 has a silicate feature that could be partly self - absorbed , as well as some weak ice absorption features .",
    "the late spectral type of lkha 358 ( m5.5 according to @xcite and @xcite ) suggests that this object will end up as a very low - mass star , with a mass close to that of a brown dwarf .",
    "iras 04154 + 2823 is very faint and could be a more evolved protostar ; in fact , its 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature seems to be self - absorbed , with a broad absorption centered at 9.7 @xmath0 m and emission between 10 and 12 @xmath0 m , which is an indication of a tenuous envelope .",
    "its sed can be fitted reasonably well with a low - density envelope model ( see figure [ model_04154 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we generated envelope models for 22 of the 28 class i objects we observed in the taurus star - forming region using the irs on _ spitzer _ to characterize some of the envelope parameters that result in the observed sed shapes .",
    "these models include the contributions of the central protostar , the disk , and the envelope to compute the resulting sed of a protostellar system .",
    "we used a modeling code based on two types of models that differ in the initial configuration : so - called tsc models ( after * ? ? ? * ) , which assume an initially spherically symmetric molecular cloud core , and sheet - collapse models @xcite , which simulate the collapse of elongated cloud cores .",
    "both models result in flattened density distributions , in which the emergent sed is strongly dependent on the inclination angle of the system .",
    "below , we will briefly introduce these two types of models .      in the tsc models ,",
    "the radiative equilibrium temperature is determined first by using the angle - averaged density distribution for the infall region ( @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 ; @xmath1 , the centrifugal radius , is where material falling in on the equatorial plane lands and thus represents the outer disk radius ) . in this region ,",
    "departures from spherical symmetry become apparent only at small distances , when material falls onto a disk ; at large distances , the tsc model can be described by spherical free - fall .",
    "after the temperature distribution has been calculated , the flattened , axially symmetric density distribution from @xcite is used to compute the flux emitted by the system ( * ? ? ? * from here on kch93 ) .",
    "the models also include isotropic scattering . the source luminosity is not set according to the mass infall rate , which means that the disk accretion rate can be different from the mass infall rate of the envelope .",
    "outflow cavities along the poles can also be included in the models by specifying a cavity semi - opening angle @xcite . inside the bipolar cavities ,",
    "material has been evacuated ; outside , material will fall onto a disk with an inner radius @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the half opening angle of the cavity , i.e. the angle between the polar axis and the streamline of an infalling particle at the edge of cavity at large distances , and @xmath1 is the centrifugal radius @xcite .",
    "thus , the shape of the cavities is determined by the streamlines of the infalling material .",
    "the inclusion of a cavity in the density distribution of the envelope causes departures from spherical symmetry in the temperature distribution .",
    "scattered light from these cavities adds flux at near - infrared wavelengths , but the cavities also remove hot , inner dust . therefore , for larger cavities , the net result is a decrease in near- and mid - infrared flux when the inclination angle is larger than the opening angle of the cavity .",
    "however , when the inclination of the system allows the observer to see inside the cavity and thus the star and inner disk directly , the near - infrared emission increases @xcite .",
    "sheet - collapse models start from the collapse of sheets that are initially in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this modification to the spherical infall scenario produces partially evacuated cavities , which , when aligned along the line of sight , reveal the inner parts of the envelope and disk , thus increasing the object s optical and near - infrared emission . since the polar regions of the sheet collapse before the equatorial regions , polar cavities , which are regions where low - density material is falling in , will result @xcite . with sheet collapse , the opening angle of the cavity",
    "is connected to the infall and not to the outflows ; eventually , outflows , but also wide - angle stellar winds @xcite , might easily remove the low - density material and fully clear out the cavities , so in the end both effects , sheet collapse and mass loss from a protostar , could be responsible for the formation of cavities .      the disk is modeled as an optically thick , steady accretion disk irradiated as a flat disk by the central star ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) , oriented perpendicular to the rotation axis of the envelope . as the outer disk regions , which emit mostly in the sub - mm and mm , are optically thin , and only the inner disk regions are optically thick , the outer disk radius was set at 10 au to represent the optically thick part of the disk .",
    "however , the disk is expected to extend out to @xmath1 ; emission from the protostellar envelope will be obscured if it lies behind the disk along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , to take this obscuration effect into account , a second set of models was calculated with the disk radius set equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the latter set was used for the envelope and stellar emission , while the set with the smaller disk radius was used for the disk emission . in this way",
    "the disk component in our models represents only the optically thick disk regions ; the optically thin outer regions would likely add small amounts of additional flux at sub - mm and mm wavelengths .",
    "this simple disk model also does not include an inner disk wall at the dust truncation radius , which would add flux at near - ir wavelengths , in particular for systems with higher inclination angles @xmath33 , where the disk emission is reduced due to its @xmath34 dependence .",
    "in addition , since the disk model does not include an optically thin disk atmosphere that generates a 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission feature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , the shape of the silicate feature is only determined by the envelope .",
    "the material in the envelope will extinguish the disk and thus generate a 10 @xmath0 m absorption feature in the continuum emission arising from the disk , while the silicates in the envelope will produce an emission feature when the density is low and an absorption feature for higher densities .",
    "thus , the silicate feature might not be modeled realistically for class i objects with low envelope densities , but should be a good approximation for more typical , higher - density envelopes .",
    "the inner disk radius is set by the star s magnetosphere , which channels the accretion flow onto the star , and is roughly at the corotation radius , at a few stellar radii from the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "however , in some models the inner disk radius was set equal to the stellar radius , implying a boundary layer .",
    "the accretion luminosity is set as the sum of the disk accretion luminosity , generated as matter accretes through the disk , and of the hot component luminosity , produced by the dissipation of the accretion shock on the stellar surface .",
    "for the cases where the inner disk radius is equal to the stellar radius , half of the accretion luminosity is emitted by the disk , and the other half by the boundary layer . for larger inner disk radii , the accretion shock accounts for a larger fraction of the accretion luminosity than matter accreting through the disk .",
    "the dust in the envelope is composed of small silicate and graphite grains @xcite , troilite ( fes ) , and water ice @xcite , as well co@xmath15 ice @xcite .",
    "the particle size distribution follows a power law with particle radius @xmath35 : @xmath36 , with maximum sizes of 0.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "this maximum grain size corresponds to the typical value found in the interstellar medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is motivated by the notion that envelopes likely contain pristine material .",
    "our data confirm this idea , since the shape of the silicate absorption feature in most of our class i objects indicates that the dust is dominated by small grains ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance of the various components of the dust mixture is similar to the one adopted by @xcite , who adjusted the abundances given in @xcite and @xcite to fit a model to the spectrum of l1551 irs 5 .",
    "we do not include organics in our mixture ; we assume that the carbon is present in the form of graphite only .",
    "the fractional abundances with respect to the mass of the gas for silicates , graphite , troilite , and h@xmath15o ice are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . to get a better fit to the observed seds , these fractional mass abundances",
    "could be varied until a good match was found , but in order to limit the number of free parameters in the fit , we kept the abundances of these components constant . only the co@xmath15 ice abundance was adjusted for each object to reproduce the depth of the co@xmath15 ice feature .",
    "the opacities used in the current model should be regarded as approximations : the water ice opacities used in the model do not generate a feature at 6.0 @xmath0 m , which is detected in our irs spectra of class i objects , and other ice opacities , e.g. for methanol ice , which might be responsible for the feature at 6.8 @xmath0 m , are not included .",
    "also , the 15.2 @xmath0 m ice feature is treated as pure co@xmath15 ice , but in reality is likely mixed with water and other ices , making the feature broader @xcite .",
    "therefore , our envelope models are not able to reproduce the majority of the ice features , and the most prominent ice feature , the co@xmath15 feature , can only be approximated in its depth , not its width .",
    "on the other hand , since the purpose of this study is a characterization of the overall seds of class i objects , and thus of their envelope structure , we will neglect the fact that the ice features will not be reproduced well or at all .",
    "the input parameters for the models are the total system luminosity ( @xmath41 ) , the fraction of the total luminosity that arises from the star ( @xmath42 ) , the radius of the star ( assumed to be 2 r@xmath23 ) , the minimum disk radius , the centrifugal radius ( which is essentially the outer disk radius ) , the inner and outer envelope radii , the flattening of the envelope ( for sheet - collapse models ) , and the reference density @xmath43 , which is the density the envelope would have at a radius of 1 au for the limit @xmath44 .",
    "the latter parameter , @xmath43 , is related to the mass infall rate @xmath45 and the central mass @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47 for a fixed central mass , @xmath43 determines the mass infall rate .",
    "the inner radius of the envelope is determined by the dust destruction , which , for typical dust made of silicates , is at the dust sublimation temperature of @xmath10 1500 k. if a cavity is included , the inner envelope radius will be farther out .",
    "the outer envelope radius is constrained particularly by sub - mm and mm observations , since this parameter affects the sed almost exclusively beyond about 100 @xmath0 m ; typical values are several 1000 au .    for sheet - collapse models ,",
    "the flattening of the envelope is described by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the outer radius of the envelope and h is the scale height of the original sheet , an isothermal , infinite , flat layer in hydrostatic equilibrium , and is defined by @xmath50 with @xmath51 equal to the surface density @xcite . over the course of the collapse of a flattened molecular cloud core , it is thought that @xmath52 increases , reflecting an increase in the size of the cavity .",
    "the emergent sed is computed with the disk radius ( set equal to 10 au for the disk component , and to @xmath1 for the stellar and envelope components ) , the inclination angle to the line of sight , and the opening angle of the cavity as parameters .",
    "scattering is also included , which causes an increase in flux at near - infrared wavelengths ( @xmath14 3 @xmath0 m ) . the parameters that affect a modeled sed the most are @xmath43 , @xmath1 , and the inclination angle .",
    "the higher the density , the deeper the silicate absorption feature and the longer the wavelength at which the sed peaks .",
    "a high inclination angle will also increase the silicate feature depth , in addition to decreasing the emission below 8 @xmath0 m and increasing the emission in the far - infrared . the centrifugal radius , besides representing the outer disk radius , also defines the region where infalling material piles up ; thus , for smaller @xmath1 high - density material can be found closer to the central protostar , resulting in more mid- to far - infrared emission and a deeper silicate absorption feature . a sketch of our model envelope , with important model parameters identified , is shown in figure [ env_sketch ] .    from previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , typical values for young protostars in the taurus star - forming region are an @xmath1 of @xmath10 100 au , and mass infall rates a few times 10@xmath53 m@xmath23 yr@xmath24 .",
    "observations exclude centrifugal radii larger than about 1000 au and mass infall rates larger than 10@xmath53 m@xmath23 yr@xmath24 . from equation [ rho1_equ ] , it follows that typical values for @xmath43 are of the order of 10@xmath54 to 10@xmath55 g  @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite find that characteristic values of @xmath52 are between 2.5 and 3.5 for the main infall phase of the envelope , resulting in large opening angles for the cavities . over time , @xmath52 should increase , up to a maximum value of @xmath10 4 , and the cavities become larger .",
    "inclinations are usually larger than 60 , but this could be a selection effect , since the seds of low - inclination protostars with large cavities would resemble the seds of t tauri stars and therefore not be classified as class i objects @xcite .    in the following section , we will introduce our envelope models for 22 class i objects of our sample . in figures",

    "@xcite imaged this object in the near - ir with hst ; it is surrounded by a nebulosity on one side , with the protostar at its base .",
    "this might indicate that we are observing iras 04016 + 2610 through the opening of a large cavity in the envelope .",
    "a bipolar molecular outflow is oriented along the axis of symmetry of the nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; its inclination angle was estimated to be 60  by @xcite .    in figure [ model_04016 ]",
    "we show an envelope model for iras 04016 + 2610 whose parameters were adjusted to yield a good fit of the near - ir to mm sed .",
    "a sheet - collapse model with @xmath57 had to be adopted ; tsc models did not yield enough flux on the short- and long - wavelength sides of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature .",
    "the irs spectrum is fitted reasonably well between about 8.5 and 25 @xmath0 m ; the discrepancies at the shorter wavelength side might be resolved by adjusting the abundances of the dust and ices in the model , while the lower irs fluxes beyond 25 @xmath0 m could be an aperture effect , with the irs slits truncating the regions contributing to the 2040 @xmath0 m region .    the model shown in figure [ model_04016 ] , with a density of @xmath58 g @xmath56 , an @xmath1 value of 100 au , and an inclination angle of 40 , is one of several that yielded a comparable good fit . in particular ,",
    "values for @xmath43 down to 3.5 @xmath59 g @xmath56 and for @xmath1 down to 70 au , as well as inclination angles within 3050 , would yield acceptable fits .",

    "on the other hand , our best - fit model agrees very well with the results of @xcite and of @xcite . a much smaller @xmath1 would result in an sed that is too narrow and contain too much flux in the 2050 @xmath0 m region , while a large @xmath1 would require larger inclination angles to match the 10 @xmath0 m feature and longer - wavelength irs flux , but it would also decrease the emission below 8 @xmath0 m . @xcite",
    "require a larger centrifugal radius of 300 au , combined with a larger value for @xmath43 and an inclination angle of 65 , to reproduce the near - ir images of iras 04016 + 2610 .",
    "our derived range for the inclination angle , 3050 , is somewhat smaller than the value of 60  derived from observations @xcite and modeling ( kch93 ) .",
    "in addition , our derived cavity semi - opening angle of 5  is smaller than expected from the images ; for example , @xcite derive a value of 25  for @xmath60 . if we adopted a larger cavity , the emission from near - ir wavelengths to about 20 @xmath0 m would decrease and therefore not fit the shape of most of the irs spectrum . finally , our adopted luminosity of 4.5 l@xmath23 is larger than the bolometric luminosity of 3.7 l@xmath23 ( kh95 ) , but necessary to yield enough flux .",
    "this protostar is part of a binary ; it is separated by about 21  from component a , which is less embedded , displays a silicate emission feature , but is about a factor of 5 fainter in the mid - infrared ( see figure [ 04108_2803ab ] ) .",
    "therefore , component b clearly dominates in the mid - ir ; while 04108 + 2803 a probably is a reddened t tauri star , 04108 + 2803 b is a class i object . both sources have no optical counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "according to @xcite , iras 04108 + 2803 b is a class i object based on its bolometric temperature of 179 k , but would be classified as a class 0 object based on its submillimeter luminosity .",
    "this iras source is not resolved in the 450 and 850 @xmath0 m maps of @xcite ; since it is also very faint at 1.3 mm ( 39 mjy ; * ? ? ? * ) and does not have an outflow , it is likely an evolved protostar with a smaller envelope .",
    "the envelope model for iras 04108 + 2803 b requires relatively low density ( @xmath61 g @xmath56 ) , a small centrifugal radius ( r@xmath62 au ) , a moderate - size cavity ( @xmath63 10 ) , and an inclination angle of 40  ( figure [ model_04108b ] ) .",
    "the outer envelope radius was set at 6000 au , which is larger than the projected binary separation of 3000 au , but necessary to fit the sub - mm and mm emission .",
    "this suggests that component a is likely obscured by this envelope ; alternatively , iras 04108 + 2803 b could be surrounded by a smaller envelope , but a fairly large circumstellar disk , which would add to the long - wavelength emission .",
    "the irs spectrum is fitted rather well with this envelope model ; the change in slope of the spectrum beyond 25 @xmath0 m could be an effect of slit truncation .",
    "the fit of the 10 @xmath0 m feature and of the slope of the irs spectrum between 10 and 25 @xmath0 m suggests that the values for the density and the centrifugal radius are relatively well - constrained .",

    "@xcite derived a large value for @xmath43 , too , but an @xmath1 similar to our value ; their best - fit model included a massive disk surrounded by a 500 au envelope .    in our models",
    ", we can exclude @xmath1 values larger than about 50 au , since they would result in a decrease in flux from 15 to 40 @xmath0 m due to an overall shallower sed shape . a reference density up to @xmath64",
    "g @xmath56 would still fit the observed sed , if combined with a smaller inclination angle ( @xmath10 25 ) to reduce the depth of the silicate absorption feature .",
    "the cavity semi - opening angle of 10  is required to fit the irs spectrum ; a smaller opening angle would result in an increase in flux in the 1025 @xmath0 m wavelength range .",
    "the inner disk radius was set at 3 stellar radii to decrease the flux in the 28 @xmath0 m region ; this parameter does not affect the remaining parts of the sed .",
    "iras 04154 + 2823 might be a transition object between the class i and ii stage , since it has an sed that is somewhat decreasing in the mid - ir , and it also does not display a prominent silicate absorption feature .",
    "however , its spectrum shows a clear co@xmath15 ice absorption feature at 15.2 @xmath0 m , and its overall infrared sed is relatively flat , suggesting that some envelope material should be present .",
    "it is also very faint in the optical @xcite , possibly indicating larger extinction along the line of sight .",
    "it is somewhat reminiscent of iras 04158 + 2805 , which is also faint and has a relatively flat sed over the irs spectral range .",
    "this protostar has a low luminosity ( l@xmath65 = 0.30.4 l@xmath23 ; see table [ tab_lum_incl ] ) ; its envelope model requires a very low reference density of @xmath66 g @xmath56 and a very small centrifugal radius of 10 au to reproduce the mid - ir spectrum as well as the sub - mm measurements ( figure [ model_04154 ] ) .",
    "however , this model overestimates the flux between 20 and 100 @xmath0 m and slightly underestimates the mm flux .",
    "a luminosity value higher than about 0.4 l@xmath23 would result in an increase in the long - wavelength flux , which would fit the mm data better , but yield even more flux between 20 and 60 @xmath0 m .",
    "an increase in @xmath43 would have a similar effect ; in addition , values of @xmath43 larger than about @xmath67 g @xmath56 can be excluded given the constraint of the weak silicate absorption feature .",

    "thus , this class i object is likely deeply embedded .",
    "it also has bipolar outflows @xcite , which are highly collimated and of extremely high velocity @xcite , consistent with this object s early evolutionary stage , possibly placing it at the class 0 stage .",
    "the high degree of symmetry of the red- and blueshifted gas of the outflows @xcite suggests that this object is likely seen close to edge - on . for the sed plot",
    ", we included the h and k magnitudes measured by @xcite .",

    "in fact , an envelope model that fits it well ( see figure [ model_04166 ] ) has an inclination angle of 85 .",
    "smaller inclination angles ( 70 - 80 ) would result in models that match the observed spectrum from 15 to 30 @xmath0 m more closely , but they would overestimate the emission from the near - ir to 8 @xmath0 m . increasing",
    "the cavity semi - opening angle by just 1  from its current value of 6  would lower the flux between 8 and 30 @xmath0 m , resulting in a better fit of the slope of the spectrum beyond 12 @xmath0 m , but a poorer fits of the silicate feature .",
    "an inner disk radius of 5 stellar radii was adopted to lower the flux below 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "a reference density of @xmath73 g @xmath56 and a large centrifugal radius ( @xmath1 = 300 au ) are required to fit the depth of the silicate feature and also the width of the sed .",

    "however , our model does not reproduce the detailed shape of the observed 10 @xmath0 m feature .",

    "the sed of iras 04368 + 2557 ( figure [ model_04368 ] ) is similar to that of iras 04302 + 2247 ( figure [ model_04302 ] ) ; both objects have a deep silicate absorption feature and seds that peak between 60 and 70 @xmath0 m .",
    "both are seen close to edge - on , but the reference density of the iras 04368 + 2557 model fit is higher ( @xmath103 g @xmath56 ) , and the centrifugal radius smaller ( @xmath1 = 200 au ) . on the other hand , about 20% changes in @xmath43 and @xmath1 yield comparable model fits , as long as the cavity semi - opening angle lies between 20  and 30 , and the source is seen edge - on .",
    "we can exclude a high density as derived by kch93 ( 3.2 @xmath104 g @xmath56 ) , but agree reasonably well with their result of @xmath1 ( 300 au ) and inclination angle ( 60 - 90 ) .    in the near - ir ,",

    "however , this object is extended in irac images , and the photometry from the 6  aperture shown in figure [ model_04368 ] does not capture all of the strong extended emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as with iras 04302 + 2247 , the values for @xmath43 and @xmath1 are fairly well constrained by the depth of the silicate absorption feature , the shape of the irs spectrum beyond 10 @xmath0 m , and the width and peak of the sed ( the 100 , 160 , and 1300 @xmath0 m measurements are likely overestimates due to aperture effects ) .",

    "a good model fit for iras 04381 + 2540 ( see figure [ model_04381 ] ) requires a somewhat higher luminosity than its bolometric luminosity of 0.7 l@xmath23 ( see table [ tab_lum_incl ] ) to be able to reproduce the long - wavelength emission . by increasing the inner disk radius to 5 stellar radii , the emission in the near - ir and mid - ir out to 8 @xmath0 m is decreased , resulting in a better fit . the centrifugal radius of 70 au and the reference density of @xmath105 g @xmath56 are well constrained by the depth of the silicate absorption feature and the shape of the irs spectrum from 15 to 30 @xmath0 m .",
    "decreasing @xmath1 to 60 au and the inclination angle to 35  yields a nearly identical fit , but we can exclude larger changes in these parameters , as well for the reference density .",
    "previous modeling by kch93 yielded a value of @xmath86 g @xmath56 for @xmath43 and 300 au for @xmath1 , and an inclination angle of 30 .",
    "however , better - constrained models by @xcite resulted in values for @xmath43 and @xmath1 similar to ours .",

    "are at the lower limits of the range suggested by @xcite .",
    "our value for @xmath60 agrees well with the modeling result of @xcite , but our inclination angle is smaller ; on the other hand , this latter quantity is consistent with the result of @xcite , but not with their cavity semi - opening angle of 40 .",
    "higher values for both parameters can be excluded based on the constraints placed by our irs spectrum on the envelope models .",

    "based on the m6 spectral type of iras 04489 + 3042 , @xcite indicated that it could be substellar , a class i brown dwarf .",
    "however , recent spectral type determinations by @xcite suggest that its spectral type is m3m4 , thus placing it into the low - mass star regime . iras 04489 + 3042",
    "is not extended in the near - ir or mm @xcite , and no outflow has been detected @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest it could be in transition between class i and ii stage , probably seen close to pole - on .",
    "our preliminary envelope model fit for this object ( figure [ model_04489 ] ) suggests a low density ( @xmath107 g @xmath56 ) , a small centrifugal radius ( @xmath1 = 15 au ) , a very small cavity , and a low inclination . models by kch93 yielded the same reference density as our model and a similar low inclination angle , but a centrifugal radius of 70 au . on the other hand , modeling efforts by @xcite resulted in larger values for all these three parameters .",
    "we can exclude a centrifugal radius larger than about 25 au , since it would decrease the flux over the 10 - 60 @xmath0 m spectral range .",
    "the low density and inclination angle of our model are mainly set by the very weak silicate absorption feature and roughly flat sed from about 5 to 15 @xmath0 m .",
    "the model does not yield a good fit of the details of the irs spectrum below about 15 @xmath0 m , but the overall shape of the spectrum is reproduced reasonably well . to fit the data point at 1.3 mm with the set of model parameters described above , we adopted an outer envelope radius of only 1000 au ; the small envelope contributes only little emission in the mm , where the emission from the disk dominates ( see the dash - dotted line in figure [ model_04489 ] ) .",
    "since there are no sub - mm measurements available , and the irs spectrum is relatively flat with no strong silicate feature , the current model parameters are only weakly constrained .",
    "coku tau/1 was identified as a class ii object by kh95 , but it is surrounded by filamentary reflection nebulae detected in the near - ir and suggested to represent the walls of outflow cavities @xcite .",

    "similar to iras 04248 + 2612 and 04264 + 2433 , coku tau/1 has a silicate emission feature and an infrared sed that is rising from 3 to about 20 @xmath0 m ( see figure [ classi_sed ] ) .",
    "the appearance of coku tau/1 in the near - ir suggests that it is surrounded by a low - density envelope and an edge - on disk .",
    "it is likely a more evolved protostar , at a stage when the envelope has begun dissipating .",
    "the binary and the inner disk are extinguished by the outer disk , but since in the near - ir the optical depth of the outer regions of the circumbinary disk decreases , the two stars at the center are seen at near - ir wavelengths . as in the optical ,",
    "there is likely also some stellar light scattered by the envelope contributing to the near - ir emission .    our model of coku tau/1 ( see figure [ model_coku_tau1 ] )",
    "requires a low density ( @xmath108 g @xmath56 ) , a small centrifugal radius ( @xmath1 = 40 au ) , a cavity semi - opening angle of 5 , and a high inclination angle ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "we adopted a luminosity of 1.1 l@xmath23 , which is slightly higher than the measured bolometric luminosity of 1.0 l@xmath23 ( see table [ tab_lum_incl ] ) .",
    "the inner disk radius was set at 7 stellar radii to decrease the emission from the near - ir to 8 @xmath0 m , which is still higher than the observed fluxes , most likely due to an overestimate of the scattered light emission from the envelope .",
    "the shape of the irs spectrum between 12 and 20 @xmath0 m constrains the centrifugal radius , while the low density is required to generate a silicate emission feature and cause the sed to peak around 30 @xmath0 m .",
    "decreasing @xmath43 by about 20% and increasing or decreasing @xmath1 by roughly the same percentage yields comparable fits , provided the inclination angle lies in the 70 - 80range .",
    "a previous model by @xcite yielded a reference density smaller by about a factor of three , a comparable values for @xmath1 , but a somewhat smaller inclination angle and a larger cavity opening angle .",
    "we can exclude a larger cavity , since it would decrease the flux of the 10 @xmath0 m silicate emission feature .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the silicate emission feature at 10 @xmath0 m is generated by the envelope .",
    "the disk just contributes a weak silicate absorption feature , which results from our simple disk model that includes only continuum emission , extinguished by the envelope .",
    "a more realistic edge - on disk would yield a somewhat stronger absorption feature ; however , the envelope emission clearly dominates over that of the disk at 10 @xmath0 m , a fact that also applies to iras 04264 + 2433 and , to a lesser extent , iras 04248 + 2612 ( long - dashed gray lines in figures [ model_04248 ] , [ model_04264 ] , [ model_coku_tau1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the silicate emission feature is not greatly affected by the shape of the silicate feature originating from the disk , and our current models of low - density envelopes have some validity .",
    "this object displays some similarity to hh 30 ; its near - ir hst images show an edge - on disk and a bipolar reflection nebulosity ( see fig .  [ dgtaub_slits ] ) , which was interpreted as the walls of an outflow cavity @xcite . in the optical , the nebula is visible , too , but the star is not detected @xcite .",
    "dg tau b is also the source of a jet , which is oriented perpendicular to the disk and along the axis of symmetry of the reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "a molecular outflow , oriented along the redshifted optical jet , has also been observed @xcite .    our preliminary model for dg tau b",
    "( see figure [ model_dgtaub ] ) has an inclination angle of 55  and a cavity semi - opening angle of 10 ; both values are smaller than expected from the optical and near - ir images .",
    "however , a more highly inclined envelope would result in a steeply rising sed over the mid - ir range , which would not match the observed spectrum .",
    "the centrifugal radius ( and thus outer disk radius ) of 60 au is poorly constrained ; a larger value would better fit the slope of the irs spectrum beyond 20 @xmath0 m , but result in a shallower silicate feature at 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "the deep silicate absorption feature requires a relatively high density ( @xmath110 g @xmath56 ) , but its long - wavelength wing is not fitted very well .",
    "in addition , the model is not well - constrained at longer wavelengths , since dg tau b lacks any sub - mm measurements , and the _ iras _ fluxes at 60 and 100 @xmath0 m are uncertain due to the proximity of dg tau : the far - ir fluxes contain the emission of both dg tau b and dg tau , which lies 1  to the northeast of dg tau b and is about two to three times brighter in the mid - ir .",
    "recent models by @xcite yielded quite different model parameters , except for the reference density ; they were able to fit the near - ir images of dg tau b adopting a luminosity of 0.2 l@xmath23 , a centrifugal radius of 300 au , a @xmath43 value of @xmath90 g @xmath56 , and cavity semi - opening and inclination angles of 30  and 73 , respectively .",
    "this set of parameters would not fit the irs spectrum .",
    "in particular , we adopted a luminosity of 2.5 l@xmath23 ; a smaller luminosity , closer to the value derived from integrating under the sed ( 1.8 l@xmath23 ) , would result in less far - ir flux and require a smaller inclination angle to still reproduce the mid - infrared spectrum , which would be inconsistent with the hst images , which indicate a more edge - on orientation .",
    "even though hl tau is considered by some a classical t tauri star surrounded by an accretion disk , it is also embedded in an envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is supported by our irs spectrum , which shows the silicate feature in absorption , as well as ice absorption features in the 58 @xmath0 m range and at 15.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "hl tau is also very bright at sub - mm and mm wavelengths , and a rotating , elongated , @xmath10 2000 au long structure has been mapped in @xmath111co @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected a compact , one - sided reflection nebulosity in the optical ; the star is not detected .",
    "hl tau drives a powerful , extended molecular outflow which was mapped in co emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed hl tau in the near - ir with adaptive optics and resolved the inner accretion disk and bipolar outflow cavities .",
    "they concluded that hl tau is surrounded by an accretion disk of about 150 au radius , inclined at 67 , and an infalling envelope of about 1200 au radius .",
    "however , the environment of hl tau is quite complicated , partly due to its proximity to xz tau , which is likely at the origin of an expanding shell that compresses the nebula around hl tau @xcite .",
    "the sed of hl tau can be reproduced with an envelope model with a luminosity of 8.0 l@xmath23 , which is somewhat larger than its measured bolometric luminosity ( see table [ tab_lum_incl ] ) , a relatively high density ( @xmath112 g @xmath56 ) , an @xmath1 value of 100 au , and flattening parameter @xmath52 of 1.0 , i.e. , a sheet - collapse model ( figure [ model_hltau ] ) .",
    "the latter quantity was adjusted to yield more flux in the 12 to 30 @xmath0 m region compared to the tsc models .",
    "a lower density would yield a 10 @xmath0 m silicate feature that is too narrow , while a density up to @xmath113 g @xmath56 would still yield a good fit .",
    "an even higher density would require a larger centrifugal radius , which would result in an sed that overestimates the flux from about 25 to 200 @xmath0 m .",
    "the @xmath1 value is constrained by the shape of the irs spectrum ; we can rule out @xmath1 values smaller than 100 au and larger than about 200 au .",
    "these results are also roughly consistent with previous modeling results by @xcite , who adopted a reference density of 3.2 @xmath59 g @xmath56 and a centrifugal radius of 200 au .",
    "we note that , despite the finding by @xcite that the inclination angle of hl tau is 67  and that large cavities are present , our model indicates virtually no cavity and a low inclination .",
    "the model by @xcite also suggests an outflow hole with a semi - opening angle of 10 ; including such a cavity in our model would reduce the flux over the irs wavelength range , but also increase the flux somewhat in the near - ir , where our model underestimates the emission .",
    "a larger inclination angle would decrease the short - wavelength flux even more and generate a deeper silicate absorption feature . on the other hand ,",
    "our value for the inclination angle is closer to the value of 30  determined by @xcite , and our disk radius ( @xmath10 @xmath1 ) is also roughly consistent with the value of 150 au found by @xcite .",
    "our model underestimates the emission at sub - mm and mm wavelengths , despite an outer envelope radius of 10,000 au .",
    "models of hl tau by @xcite have shown that the outer disk requires higher temperatures to reproduce the sed shape at longer wavelengths , implying irradiation of the circumstellar disk by the infalling envelope . since our model",
    "does not include this additional heating , our disk emission is likely underestimated ; thus , the `` missing '' flux at the longer wavelengths could be attributed in part to this additional disk component .",
    "in addition , dust outside the infall region could contribute to the mm emission .",
    "this object is the most luminous class i object in taurus ( l@xmath65 = 22 - 28 l@xmath23 ; see table [ tab_lum_incl ] ) and is therefore a well - studied protostellar system .",
    "it consists of a 03 binary , whose components are each surrounded by a circumstellar disk , and of a circumbinary disk and a flattened envelope @xcite .",
    "it is surrounded by an extended reflection nebula at optical and near - ir wavelengths @xcite , and it powers a highly collimated bipolar molecular outflow @xcite . even though no optical outburst has been observed , l1551 irs 5 is considered an fu ori object , implying episodic events of high disk accretion and outflow rates @xcite .",
    "the mid- and far - ir spectrum ( 2200 @xmath0 m ) of this bright class i object was obtained by @xcite using iso ; they detected gas - phase emission lines and ice absorption features .",
    "we also detect strong ice absorption features in our irs spectrum , in addition to a very deep and broad silicate absorption feature ( see figure [ classi_irs]c ) .",
    "l1551 irs 5 has been modeled in detail by @xcite , taking into account emission from the circumstellar and circumbinary disks , as well as the envelope .",
    "the model presented below does not include all the components of the system as in @xcite and should therefore be considered as preliminary .",
    "l1551 irs 5 is the most luminous object in our sample ( adopted luminosity of 25  l@xmath23 ) .",
    "its deep silicate absorption feature requires a high density ( @xmath114 g @xmath56 ) , and the steep sed beyond 15 @xmath0 m a centrifugal radius of 100 au ( see figure [ model_l1551 ] ) .",
    "an @xmath1 value larger than about 150 au would result in a decrease in flux between 15 and 30 @xmath0 m and thus degrade the fit to the irs spectrum .",
    "our model indicates that the cavity is small ( @xmath635 ) , and the object is seen at an intermediate inclination angle .",
    "increasing @xmath43 would require a smaller inclination angle , but a larger inclination is more in accordance with the observed outflows ( @xmath33=65 ; @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the models by kch93 , which suggested a reference density of @xmath10 @xmath115 g @xmath56 , a centrifugal radius between 70 and 300 au , and an inclination angle between 30  and 60 , our model has a smaller , but still high , reference density , an @xmath1 value towards the lower end of the kch93 range , and an inclination angle in the middle of the range determined by kch93 .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , @xcite , modeled this object with a reference density of only @xmath90 g @xmath56 , @xmath116 40 au , @xmath60=20 , and @xmath117 70 .",
    "our model parameters are different from the ones found by @xcite , who adopted an inclination angle of 50 , @xmath118 g @xmath56 , @xmath119 au , and a flattening parameter @xmath120 for the envelope .",
    "we could obtain a comparable fit of the sed out to 30 @xmath0 m by using @xmath121 l@xmath23 , @xmath122 g @xmath56 , @xmath123 au , @xmath124 , @xmath42=0.1 , @xmath60=0.1 , and @xmath9145 , but the far - ir emission would be overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "the sub - mm and mm emission would be better matched with the sheet - collapse model .",
    "thus , the sed of l1551 irs 5 can be reproduced by a tsc model , but the long - wavelength emission suggests the presence of an additional , cold , likely elongated , dust component that is outside of the infall region .",
    "the mid - infrared spectra of class i objects have quite different appearances ; while some differences are caused by individual envelope parameters like the density and size of the infall region , the inclination angle also plays an important role . a class i object viewed pole - on through a cavity in the envelope can look like a class ii object with some additional long - wavelength excess emission ( as some fu ori objects appear ; see @xcite ) , while an edge - on class i object can have the appearance of a class 0 object",
    "however , the envelope around a true protostar will generate excess emission at mid - ir to mm wavelengths , resulting in a larger infrared excess than expected from an accretion disk alone , and less excess when compared to the large , cool envelopes around class 0 objects that peak at sub - mm to mm wavelengths .",
    "in addition , if seen within a narrow range of inclination angles , an edge - on class ii object can appear similar to an embedded protostar ( see * ? ? ? * ) , but it would lack additional excess emission caused by the envelope .    observations at other wavelengths help in identifying the evolutionary state of an object : as noted by @xcite , true class i sources are usually extended in the near - ir and at sub - mm or mm wavelengths , the former due to light scattered by dust in inner envelope regions , the latter due to thermal emission by dust in the outer parts of the envelope .",
    "furthermore , class i objects usually have molecular outflows or jets detected in the optical / near - ir and especially at mm wavelengths .",
    "objects in transition between the class i and class ii stage are expected to be surrounded by less envelope material , in accordance with larger cavities in their envelopes .",
    "of the 28 class i objects presented in this paper , 7 were previously identified as class ii objects in kh95 : iras 04154 + 2823 , 04158 + 2805 , 04278 + 2253 , coku tau/1 , hl tau , ic 2087 ir , and lkha 358 . while the sed shape of these objects might indicate that they are t tauri stars",
    "whose envelope has already mostly dissipated , the presence of ice features in their mid - infrared spectrum , as well as the detection of extended reflection nebulosities and outflows around some of these objects , suggests that there is still some remnant envelope material .",
    "iras 04154 + 2823 , 04278 + 2253 , 04489 + 3042 , ic 2087 ir , and lkha 358 , as well as some of the class ii objects presented in @xcite ( iras 04187 + 1927 , dg tau , dp tau , fs tau , hn tau , t tau , and xz tau ) , could be objects in transition between the class i and ii stage , when a protostar has almost completely cleared its envelope , but is still surrounded by some nebulosity . in some cases , the `` evolved '' protostar is still generating outflows , but due to envelope clearing it appears more and more like a classical t tauri star . in some other cases , like t tau , hn tau , and xz tau ,",
    "a binary consists of a t tauri star and a more deeply embedded source , which is likely an effect of the particular viewing geometry of the system : either one component is more aligned with the outflow cavity and thus less embedded , or the more extinguished component is actually a t tauri star oriented edge - on .",
    "therefore , as stated earlier , the inclination angle is an important factor in determining the appearance of class i and ii objects .",
    "the ice and silicate absorption features detected in the irs spectra are also a useful tool to characterize class i objects .",
    "the peak optical depth of these features reveals their strength and can therefore be used as an indication for their origin . to determine the optical depth of the co@xmath15 ice feature at 15.2 @xmath0 m and that of the silicate absorption feature around 10 @xmath0 m , we first used a spline fit to determine the underlying continuum .",
    "then we derived the optical depth , @xmath125 , assuming @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the observed and the underlying continuum flux , respectively .",
    "the measured peak optical depths of the co@xmath15 and silicate absorption features are shown in figure [ co2_sil_taus ] , together with previous measurements by @xcite and @xcite , who determined the optical depths of silicate and ice absorption features in iso spectra of embedded , massive ysos and low- and intermediate - mass ysos , respectively . for the @xcite data",
    ", we used the same conversion as in @xcite to convert the co@xmath15 equivalent widths to peak optical depths .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , the low - mass class i objects in taurus generally have large peak co@xmath15 optical depths , especially considering that their peak silicate optical depth lies below @xmath10 2 ( the object with the largest silicate and co@xmath15 optical depths is iras 04368 + 2557 , a class 0 object ) .",
    "most of the objects observed by @xcite have similarly strong co@xmath15 ice features for larger silicate optical depths , suggesting additional extinction along the line of sight towards these objects .",
    "it is expected that the two optical depths track each other along lines of sight through molecular clouds ( with some dispersion due to different conditions in different clouds ) , since ice mantles are thought to grow in a similar manner onto dust grains in all comparably shielded regions of molecular clouds .",
    "the gray dashed line in figure [ co2_sil_taus ] is drawn by eye to roughly separate the region occupied by the taurus class i objects , where extinction from the envelope dominates the optical depth , from that occupied by objects seen along molecular cloud lines of sight , where the extinction is mostly due to intervening molecular cloud material .",
    "the boundary is not well - defined , since some of the iso observations did include objects in which local extinction by an envelope dominates , but it separates all but one of the taurus class i objects from the majority of the iso targets .",
    "thus , we confirm the conclusions of @xcite that dust grains in protostellar envelopes have larger ice mantles than grains in the ambient molecular cloud , implying ice mantle growth inside the envelopes . we defer a more detailed study of the ice absorption features , including the detailed composition and thus derived temperature of the ices , to a future paper ( zasowski et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "we note that the objects with a peak silicate optical depth of 0 are protostars in which the silicate feature is either in emission or displays both an emission and an absorption component . as discussed in ",
    "[ irs_spectra ] , the latter type of objects is likely seen along lines of sight that suffer from less extinction by the envelope , caused by a more face - on orientation or a lower - density envelope .",
    "therefore , for these objects the optical depth of the silicate feature , taken as a measure of dust absorption in the envelope , is probably underestimated due to contamination by the silicate emission arising from the disk .",
    "the one class i object that lies in the molecular cloud region of the plot is dg tau / b ; it has a deep silicate , but only a weak co@xmath15 ice absorption feature .",
    "this could indicate that grain mantles in its envelope are less rich in co@xmath15 ice , but on the other hand this feature is superposed on the broad and deep silicate absorption at 18 @xmath0 m , which adds additional uncertainty to the optical depth measurement of the co@xmath15 feature .",
    "the three objects identified as `` class i / ii objects '' in figure [ co2_sil_taus ] are iras 04278 + 2253 , lkha 358 , and ic 2087 ir .",
    "the former two objects have the lowest co@xmath15 feature strengths of our taurus sample and virtually no silicate absorption feature , which confirms that they are more evolved class i objects .",
    "ic 2087 ir has both co@xmath15 and silicate peak optical depths comparable to those of typical class i objects ; thus , it is still likely embedded to some extent .",
    "this shows that the optical depths of the silicate and ice absorption features can help to recognize more evolved class i objects , but the effects of the environment and viewing angle also have to be taken into account .",
    "envelope models aid in the identification and characterization of class i objects ; when models fit the sed from the near - ir to the mm , they reveal both the large- and small - scale structure of a protostar , its accretion disk and its envelope .",
    "the irs spectrum , which covers the sed from 5 to 40 @xmath0 m , is a particularly useful constraint , since the depth of the silicate feature at 10 @xmath0 m is connected to the density and inclination angle of the envelope , while the slope between 15 and 40 @xmath0 m helps to constrain the envelope shape , centrifugal radius and in part the size of the cavity .",
    "not all parameters can be uniquely defined by a model fit to the irs spectrum , but together with shorter- and longer - wavelength data , the parameter space can be narrowed down considerably .",
    "we point out that , given the large number of parameters for each model , we did not determine the goodness of a model fit by @xmath129-minimization , but rather by judging by eye , based on our experience on how the different parameters affect the resulting model sed .",
    "however , we justify the choice of specific parameters and explain how the parameter space was narrowed .",
    "in addition , the more constraints a model has , in particular the availability of sub - mm and mm flux measurements and the source s luminosity , the more limited the choice of parameters becomes .",
    "the fitting by eye is much more efficient than @xmath129-minimization , and in most cases we derive good fits that are likely minima in @xmath129 space . typical uncertainties for our model parameters are listed in the footnote of table [ tab_model_fits ] .",
    "we also note that several assumptions made in the modeling code could be refined to better reproduce the observations : e.g. , the assumption that the cavity follows the shape of the streamlines of infalling particles , the assumption of a spherically symmetric density distribution when computing the equilibrium temperature in the envelope , and the adoption of only the inner , optically thick regions of a flat accretion disk as the disk component . some of our 22 models of class i objects should be treated as preliminary , given the assumptions made in the modeling code and/or",
    "some weaker constraints due to the lack of data , but our models already reveal a large range in parameters necessary to obtain fits ( see table [ tab_model_fits ] for a summary of the model parameters ) .",
    "we computed models for the majority of class i objects in our sample ; however , we did not attempt to model objects with poor observational constraints for their seds , or objects which are likely more evolved class i objects and for which these envelope models might not apply .",
    "thus , we did not attempt to model hh 30 , whose spectrum is very noisy and whose overall sed is poorly constrained by the scarcity of measurements at other wavelengths . also iras",
    "04181 + 2654 b , a member of a binary system , was not modeled , since it lacks long - wavelength data ( we modeled component a , which was observed at 1.3 mm ) .",
    "the three sources with decreasing seds over the irs spectral range , iras 04278 + 2253 , ic 2087 ir , and lkha 358 , were also not modeled .",
    "finally , no model was produced for gv tau , since its irs spectrum is uncertain , and the fact that the two components are separated by 13 ( which corresponds to about 180 au at the distance of the taurus star - forming region ) likely introduces asymmetries in the envelope of the more embedded component .",
    "our envelope models indicate centrifugal radii , and thus disk sizes , that cover a range from 10 au up to 300 au , with a median value of 60 au .",
    "since the centrifugal radius is thought to increase rapidly with time ( @xmath130 ) , we could conclude that the objects in our sample span somewhat different ages ( about a factor of 3 ) .",
    "however , the main reason for the differences in centrifugal radii is likely different initial conditions of the collapse , since the initial centrifugal radius strongly depends on the mass of the central condensation and the initial angular velocity of the cloud core ( @xmath131 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , some of the more deeply embedded protostars that have been identified as class 0/i objects , like iras 04166 + 2706 and 04368 + 2557 , have large @xmath1 values , which would not be expected if the spread in centrifugal radii was only due to time evolution . since a disk size of a few 100 au is comparable to the radii of accretion disks found around classical t tauri stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our median value for @xmath1 ( and thus outer disk radii ) of 60 au suggests that the accretion disks found around protostars will expand , as is expected due to angular momentum transfer in the accretion process .",
    "we note that the disk component dominates the flux in the 3 - 8 @xmath0 m range for most of the models ; for about 2/3 of these objects the fraction of the luminosity contributed by the star , @xmath42 , is either 0.1 or 0.2 , i.e. , 80 - 90% of the luminosity is generated by accretion .",
    "about half of the objects that have no dominant disk contribution in the 3 - 8 @xmath0 m range have luminosities dominated by the star ( @xmath42=0.8 ) , and the other half have smaller values for @xmath42 , but generally large inclination angles .",
    "thus , the class i objects in our sample whose luminosity is dominated by accretion ( and which likely have large mass accretion rates through their disks ) generate seds that are dominated by the disk in the 3 - 8 @xmath0 m range , except if the disk emission is diminished due to a high inclination angle .",
    "the reference density @xmath43 varies from @xmath85 g @xmath56 to @xmath132 g @xmath56 , with a median value of @xmath105 g @xmath56 , very similar to the value found by kch93 .",
    "@xmath43 can be used to estimate the mass infall rate from the envelope onto the disk by applying equation [ rho1_equ ] ; for a 0.5 m@xmath23 object , the mass infall rates for the objects in our class i sample lie between @xmath133 and @xmath134 m@xmath23 yr@xmath24 , about two orders of magnitude larger than the accretion rates of classical t tauri stars .",
    "this would confirm previous results that class i objects are at an earlier evolutionary stage than t tauri stars and still accreting a substantial fraction of the final stellar mass @xcite .",
    "even though the cavity semi - opening angle and , in some cases , the inclination angle are usually less well - constrained than the reference density and centrifugal radius , we observe that our models indicate a large range of inclination angles , covering values from 15  to 89  ( with a median value of 55 ) , and a smaller range of cavity semi - opening angles ( 0.1  to 27 , with a median of 6 ) .    in table [ tab_lum_incl ] we list the luminosities of the class i objects in our sample and their inclination angles .",
    "both the values of bolometric luminosity from the literature and those we derived by integrating under the sed are actually apparent luminosities , since envelopes are not spherically symmetric .",
    "thus , we would expect the apparent bolometric luminosity to be larger than the system luminosity ( which enters as a model parameter ) at low inclination angles , while at high inclination angles the opposite should be the case .",
    "the data in table [ tab_lum_incl ] shows that this trend is only weak for our sample of class i objects ; in general , our model luminosities are higher than the apparent bolometric luminosities .",
    "this could suggest that we overestimated the luminosity of some of our lower - inclination sources .",
    "we note that most of our models do not require an initially flattened density distribution ( @xmath52 @xmath135 1 ) ; all but 5 of the 22 objects we modeled can be fitted by tsc models , which assume an initially spherically symmetric density distribution .",
    "however , we can not exclude that sheet - collapse model fits could also be found for the remaining 17 class i objects for which only tsc models have been considered so far .",
    "thus , as a starting point for models , it seems that star - forming cores in taurus can be described by the approximation of collapsing , singular isothermal spheres .    in a few cases we found that an additional component of cold dust seems to be present , since certain models are able to reproduce the sub - mm and mm fluxes measured in smaller apertures ( 10 - 20 ) , but not the measurements at similar wavelengths derived from large apertures ( 40 - 60 ) . in particular the 1.3 mm data points from @xcite , which correspond to fluxes integrated over a beam 60  in diameter ,",
    "are often higher than the model prediction .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , cold dust of roughly constant density outside of the infall region could contribute to the long - wavelength emission . in these cases",
    "envelope models could aid in the distinction between emission from infalling envelope material and emission from the surrounding dense cloud .",
    "when comparing our modeling results with previous efforts , we note that our results often differ considerably .",
    "however , in this work we have the additional constraints through our irs spectra , which , when combined with near - ir and far - ir to mm data , allows us to determine the 9 parameters entering in the envelope models .",
    "in particular the 10 @xmath0 m silicate absorption feature allows us to narrow down the parameter space .",
    "a next step in modeling would involve reproducing the images of the class i sources at the same time as the seds to better take into account the envelope geometry and asymmetries .",
    "after analyzing the irs spectra and seds of 28 class i objects in the taurus star - forming region , and generating envelope models for 22 of these objects , we conclude the following :    @xmath136 almost all protostars we observed display ice absorption features in their mid - ir spectra , which originate in the envelopes around these young stars . in particular , the co@xmath15 ice feature at 15.2 @xmath0 m is ubiquitous and strong among the class i objects in our sample , signifying an origin in the cold outer envelope regions .",
    "the envelope is also generally responsible for a deep silicate absorption feature at 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "the three objects with silicate emission features in their spectra , iras 04248 + 2612 , 04264 + 2433 , and coku tau/1 are likely class i objects seen through low - density envelopes , which are in an advanced stage of dispersal and thus considered to be more evolved .",
    "@xmath136 the seds of class i objects peak in the mid- to far - ir , where the emission is dominated by the envelope . objects with flat seds in the infrared spectral range could be in transition between the class i and ii stage .",
    "the inclination angle of protostellar systems strongly affects the appearance of their mid - ir sed ; class i objects seen pole - on could appear as class ii objects with additional long - wavelength excess emission , while edge - on class i objects have sed shapes similar to class 0 objects , but with less flux in the sub - mm and mm wavelength region .",
    "@xmath136 the irs spectra are instrumental in constraining envelope model parameters , in particular the reference density @xmath43 ( which is linked to the mass infall rate ) and centrifugal radius @xmath1 .",
    "the depth of the silicate feature and the shape of the spectrum between 12 and 30 @xmath0 m provide constraints which can be further tightened by model fits to near - ir , far - ir , sub - mm , and mm observations .",
    "the median values for @xmath43 and @xmath1 for the class i objects we modeled are @xmath137 g @xmath56 and 60 au , respectively , with a relatively large range for both parameters .",
    "the disk contribution dominates the emission in the 3 - 8 @xmath0 m range for most of the modeled class i objects , confirming the importance of disk accretion luminosity at this early evolutionary stage .",
    "most seds can be reproduced by tsc models , thus not requiring an initially flattened density distribution of the collapsing cloud core ; only 5 of the 22 objects we modeled needed sheet - collapse models for an adequate fit of their seds .",
    "the irs spectra of class i objects in taurus display a variety in appearances and add valuable constraints to envelope models .",
    "fits to the observed seds yield the parameters describing their physical structure , and thus aid in confirming and refining our understanding of protostellar cloud collapse and evolution .",
