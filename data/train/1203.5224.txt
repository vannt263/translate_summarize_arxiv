    "<S> * background : * inelastic neutrino - nucleus scattering through the weak neutral - current plays important role in stellar environment where transport of neutrinos determine the rate of cooling . </S>",
    "<S> since there are no direct experimental data on neutral - current neutrino - nucleus cross sections available , only the modeling of these reactions provides the relevant input for supernova simulations . * purpose : * to establish fully self - consistent framework for neutral - current neutrino - nucleus reactions based on relativistic nuclear energy density functional . </S>",
    "<S> * methods : * neutrino - nucleus cross sections are calculated using weak hamiltonian and nuclear properties of initial and excited states are obtained with relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model and relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation that is extended to include pion contributions for unnatural parity transitions . </S>",
    "<S> * results : * inelastic neutral - current neutrino - nucleus cross sections for @xmath0c , @xmath1o , @xmath2fe , @xmath2ni , and even isotopes @xmath3mo as well as respective cross sections averaged over distribution of supernova neutrinos . * conclusions : * the present study provides insight into neutrino - nucleus scattering cross sections in the neutral channel , their theoretical uncertainty in view of recently developed microscopic models , and paves the way for systematic self - consistent large - scale calculations involving open - shell target nuclei . </S>"
