    "this throughput scaling is achieved using a multi - hop ( mh ) communication scheme .",
    "recent results have shown that an almost linear throughput in the network , i.e. , @xmath14 for an arbitrarily small @xmath15 , is achievable by using a hierarchical cooperation ( hc ) strategy  @xcite . besides the schemes in  @xcite ,",
    "there has been a steady push to improve the throughput of wireless networks up to a linear scaling in a variety of network scenarios by using novel techniques such as networks with node mobility  @xcite , interference alignment schemes  @xcite , and infrastructure support  @xcite .",
    "although it would be good to have such a linear scaling with only wireless connectivity , in practice there will be a price to pay in terms of higher delay and higher cost of channel estimation .",
    "for these reasons , it would still be good to have infrastructure aiding wireless nodes .",
    "such hybrid networks consisting of both wireless ad hoc nodes and infrastructure nodes , or equivalently base stations ( bss ) , have been introduced and analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "bss are assumed to be interconnected by high capacity wired links .",
    "while it has been shown that bss can be beneficial in wireless networks , the impact and benefits of infrastructure support are not fully understood yet .",
    "this paper features analysis of the capacity scaling laws for a more general hybrid network where there are @xmath16 antennas at each bs , allowing the exploitation of the spatial dimension at each bs . by allowing the number @xmath17 of bss and the number @xmath16 of antennas to scale at arbitrary rates relative to the number @xmath0 of wireless nodes , achievable rate scalings and information - theoretic upper bounds",
    "are derived as a function of these scaling parameters . to show our achievability results ,",
    "two new routing protocols utilizing bss are proposed here . in the first protocol ,",
    "multiple sources ( nodes ) transmit simultaneously to each bs using a direct single - hop multiple - access in the uplink and a direct single - hop broadcast from each bs in the downlink . in the second protocol ,",
    "the high - speed bs links are combined with nearest - neighbor routing via mh among the wireless nodes .",
    "the obtained results are also compared to two conventional schemes without using bss : the mh protocol  @xcite and hc protocol  @xcite .",
    "the proposed schemes are evaluated in two different networks : dense networks  @xcite of unit area , and extended networks  @xcite of unit node density . in dense networks",
    ", it is shown that an almost linear throughput scaling is achieved as in  @xcite , which is rather obvious .",
    "on the contrary , in extended networks , depending on the network configurations and the path - loss attenuation , the proposed bs - based protocols can improve the throughput scaling significantly , compared to the case without help of bss .",
    "part of the improvement comes from the following two advantages over the conventional schemes : having more antennas enables more transmit pairs that can be activated simultaneously ( compared to those of the mh scheme ) , i.e. , enough degree - of - freedom ( dof ) gain is obtained , provided the number @xmath17 of bss and the number @xmath16 of antennas per bs are large enough .",
    "in addition , the bss help to improve the long - distance signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) times the received snr between two farthest nodes across the largest scale in wireless networks . in our bs - based network , it can be interpreted as the total snr transferred to any given node ( or bs antenna ) over a certain smaller scale reduced by infrastructure support .",
    "] , first termed in  @xcite , which leads to a larger received signal power than that of the hc scheme , i.e. , enough power gain is obtained , thus allowing for a better throughput scaling in extended networks .    to show the optimality of our proposed schemes , cut - set upper bounds on the throughput scaling",
    "are derived for a network with infrastructure .",
    "note that the previous upper bounds in  @xcite assume pure ad hoc networks and those for bs - based networks are not rigorously characterized in both dense and extended networks .",
    "in dense networks , it is shown that the obtained upper bound is the same as that of  @xcite assuming no bss .",
    "hence , it is seen that the bss can not improve the throughput scaling and the hc scheme is order - optimal for all the operating regimes . in extended networks ,",
    "the proposed approach is based in part on the characteristics at power - limited regimes shown in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that our upper bounds match the achievable throughput scalings for all the operating regimes within a factor of @xmath18 with an arbitrarily small exponent @xmath15 . to achieve the order - optimal scaling , using one of the two bs - based routings , conventional mh transmission , and hc strategy",

    "for example , regime d has the following characteristics : the hc protocol has the highest throughput when the path - loss attenuation is small , but as the path - loss exponent @xmath72 increases , the best scheme becomes the ish protocol .",
    "this is because the penalty for long - range multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) transmissions of the hc increases .",
    "finally , the imh protocol becomes dominant when @xmath72 is large since the ish protocol has a power limitation at the high path - loss attenuation regime .",
    "we now turn our attention to presenting the cut - set upper bound of the total throughput @xmath76 .",

    "the upper bound matches the achievable throughput scaling within @xmath18 in extended networks with infrastructure , and thus the scaling exponent in ( [ eq : sumex ] ) holds . in other words",

    "two conventional schemes  @xcite with no infrastructure support are also introduced for comparison .",
    "each routing protocol operates in different time slots to avoid huge mutual interference .",
    "we focus on the description for extended networks since using the hc scheme  @xcite is enough to provide a near - optimal throughput in dense networks .",
    "we generalize the conventional bs - based transmission scheme in  @xcite : a source node transmits its packet to the closest bs , the bs having the packet transmits it to the bs that is nearest to the destination of the source via wired bs - to - bs links , and the destination finally receives its data from the nearest bs . since there",
    "exist both access ( to bss ) and exit ( from bss ) routings , different time slots are used , e.g. , even and odd time slots , respectively .",
    "we start from the following lemma .",
    "[ lem : nodenum ] suppose @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",

    "the proof of this lemma is given by slightly modifying the proof of lemma 4.1 in  @xcite .",
    "note that ( [ eq : numprob ] ) tends to one as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "in contrast with previous works , the spatial dimensions enabled by having multiple antennas at each bs are exploited here , and thus multiple transmission pairs can be supported using a single bs . under extended networks , the ish transmission protocol shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ish ] is now proposed as follows :    * for the access routing , all source nodes in each cell , given by @xmath95 nodes whp from lemma [ lem : nodenum ] , transmit their independent packets simultaneously via single - hop multiple - access to the bs in the same cell . *",
    "each bs receives and jointly decodes packets from source nodes in the same cell .",
    "signals received from the other cells are treated as noise . *",
    "the bs that completes decoding its packets transmits them to the bs closest to the corresponding destination by wired bs - to - bs links .",
    "* for the exit routing , each bs transmits all packets received from other bss , i.e. , @xmath95 packets , via single - hop broadcast to the destinations in the cell .",
    "since the network is power - limited , the proposed ish scheme is used with the full power , i.e. , the transmit powers at each node and bs are @xmath69 and @xmath96 , respectively .    for the ish protocol ,",
    "more dof gain is provided compared to transmissions via mh if @xmath17 and @xmath16 are large enough .",
    "the power gain can also be obtained compared to that of the hc scheme in certain cases .",
    "the fact that the extended network is power - limited motivates the introduction of an imh transmission protocol in which multiple source nodes in a cell transmit their packets to bs in the cell via mh , thereby having much higher received power , i.e. , more power gain , than that of the direct one - hop transmission in extended networks .",
    "that is , better long - distance snr is provided with the imh protocol .",
    "similarly , each bs delivers its packets to the corresponding destinations by imh transmissions . under extended networks , the imh transmission protocol in fig .",
    "[ fig : imh ] is proposed as follows :    * divide each cell into smaller square cells of area @xmath97 each , where these smaller cells are called routing cells ( which include at least one node whp  @xcite ) .",
    "* for the access routing , @xmath98 source nodes in each cell transmit their independent packets using mh routing to the corresponding bs in the cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : access ] .",
    "it is assumed that each antenna placed only on the bs boundary receives its packet from one of the nodes in the nearest neighbor routing cell .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath98 mh paths can be supported due to our antenna placement within bss .",
    "exit routing is similar , where each antenna on the bs boundary uses power @xmath69 that satisfies the power constraint . *",
    "the bs - to - bs transmissions are the same as the ish case . *",
    "each routing cell operates based on @xmath99-time division multiple access ( tdma ) to avoid causing huge interference to its neighbor cells .",
    "note that the transmit power @xmath98 at each bs , but not full power , is enough to perform the imh protocol in the downlink .    for the imh protocol , more dof gain is possible compared to the mh scheme for large @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , more power gain can also be obtained compared to the hc and ish schemes in certain cases .",
    "the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : denseupp ] is only determined by the number @xmath0 of wireless nodes in dense networks .",
    "the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : exupper ] also indicates that either the number @xmath17 of bss or the number @xmath16 of antennas per bs should be greater than a certain level in order to obtain improved throughput scalings in extended networks .",
    "this is because otherwise less dof gain may be provided compared to that of the conventional schemes without help of bss .",

    "<S> two bs - based routing schemes are first introduced in this study : an infrastructure - supported single - hop ( ish ) routing protocol with multiple - access uplink and broadcast downlink and an infrastructure - supported multi - hop ( imh ) routing protocol . </S>",
    "<S> then , their achievable throughput scalings are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> these schemes are compared against two conventional schemes without bss : the multi - hop ( mh ) transmission and hierarchical cooperation ( hc ) schemes . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a linear throughput scaling is achieved in dense networks , as in the case without help of bss . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the proposed bs - based routing schemes can , under realistic network conditions , improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks . </S>",
    "<S> the gain comes from the following advantages of these bs - based protocols . </S>",
    "<S> first , more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in the mh scheme if the number of bss and the number of antennas are large enough . </S>",
    "<S> second , by improving the long - distance signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , the received signal power can be larger than that of the hc , enabling a better throughput scaling under extended networks . furthermore , by deriving the corresponding information - theoretic cut - set upper bounds , it is shown under extended networks that a combination of four schemes imh , ish , mh , and hc is order - optimal in all operating regimes .    </S>",
