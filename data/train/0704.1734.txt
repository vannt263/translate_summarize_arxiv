    "<S> the gravitational field equations on cosmological scales are obtained by averaging the einstein field equations of general relativity . by assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales , the local inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction ( backreaction ) terms , which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker models . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of averaging on cosmological observations are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that , based on estimates from observational data , the backreaction ( and , in particular , the averaged spatial curvature ) can have a very significant dynamical effect on the evolution of the universe and must be taken into account in observational cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> the averaging problem in cosmology is perhaps the most important unsolved problem in mathematical cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> it has considerable importance for the correct interpretation of cosmological data . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological observations @xcite , based on the assumption of a spatially homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) model plus small perturbations are usually interpreted as implying that there exists dark energy , the spatial geometry is flat , and that there is currently an accelerated expansion giving rise to the so - called @xmath0cdm - concordance model with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> although the concordance model is quite remarkable , it does not convincingly fit all data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , if the underlying cosmological model is not a perturbation of an exact flat flrw solution , the conventional data analysis and their interpretation is not necessarily valid .    </S>",
    "<S> the correct governing equations on cosmological scales are obtained by averaging the einstein equations of general relativity . by assuming spatial homogeneity and isotropy on the largest scales , the inhomogeneities affect the dynamics though correction ( backreaction ) terms , which can lead to behaviour qualitatively and quantitatively different from the flrw models . </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of theoretical approaches to the averaging problem . in the approach of buchert </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a cosmological space - time splitting is employed and only scalar quantities are averaged , whereby the hamiltonian constraint and the raychaudhuri equation can be replaced by their spatially averaged counterparts plus an integrability condition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the buchert approach is heuristic in that it is necessary to specify one more condition ( not obtained from the field equations ) in order to obtain a closed system of equations . </S>",
    "<S> the averaged hamilton constraint can be written : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the hubble - normalized dark energy contribution ( e.g. , @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the cosmological constant ) , and @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the averaged scale factor in some domain @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath12 , so that @xmath13 is given in terms of @xmath14 , the kinematic variance ( backreaction ) term and @xmath15 , the averaged spatial curvature term ( which is not necessarily isotropic ) .    the macroscopic gravity ( mg ) approach is an exact approach which gives a prescription for the correlation functions that emerge in an averaging of the einstein field equations @xcite . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> the mg equations were explicitly solved in a flrw background geometry and it was found that the correlation tensor is of the form of a spatial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this result was confirmed in subsequent work in which the spherically symmetric einstein equations were explicitly averaged @xcite , and is consistent with the work of buchert @xcite ( in the newtonian limit and for exact spherically symmetric spaces @xcite ) , with the results of averaging an exact lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) spherically symmetric dust model @xcite , and with results from linear perturbation theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no question that the backreaction effect is real @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spatial curvature must be taken into account in observational cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the only question remaining is the potential significance of the resulting effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , even a small backreaction would be of importance ; for example , a non - zero curvature , even at the 1 % level ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , would have a significant effect on observations ( for redshifts </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been verified in @xcite , where values of @xmath18 or larger were found to be consistent with observation ( if one allows for a varying dark energy equation of state parameter ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) has reported @xmath19 @xcite . in @xmath0cdm models type ia supernovae data alone </S>",
    "<S> @xcite prefers a slightly closed universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face value this suggests @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> models with non - negligible spatial curvature have been the subject of renewed interest recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are other possible ( non - dark energy ) explanations for the snia data ; indeed , it has been argued that models with no dark energy are consistent with supernova data and wmap data ( e.g. , see @xcite and references within ) . </S>",
    "<S> combining these observational data with large scale structure ( lss ) observations such as the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data can put stringent limits on the curvature parameter in the context of adiabatic @xmath0cdm models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these data analyses are very model- and prior - dependent @xcite , and the assumptions may be unjustified ( or even inconsistent ) and care is needed in the interpretation of data .    using both the buchert equations and cosmological perturbation theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , it has been found that @xmath21 is a pure second order term and @xmath22 is of first order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exact results of@xcite are consequently consistent with the results of perturbation theory and the results of buchert @xcite in the following sense . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath23 is second order and @xmath15 is first order , then we can solve the integrability condition to each order of approximation separately . </S>",
    "<S> to first order , if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 , and the averaged spatial curvature evolves like a constant  curvature model . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the exact results apply at first order . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is given in terms of the integration constant @xmath26 , which depends on the averaging scale , the scale of inhomogeneities and the matter distribution density contrast . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical effects are determined through @xmath27 .    at second order </S>",
    "<S> we obtain effects that can be modelled by buchert s heuristic approach , which can be thought of as arising from violations of the approximations and assumptions used in the exact approach . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath14 is non - zero , in addition to the possible second order effects , @xmath15 evolves differently to @xmath28 and this can , in turn , significantly affect cosmological observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since the kinematic backreaction @xmath29 decays more slowly than @xmath27 ( and @xmath30 ) , in the course of expansion the kinematic backreaction becomes dynamically more important and can become significant when the structure formation process `` injects backreaction '' ( which could then be a possible explanation of the coincidence problem ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we may expect the largest deviations from the exact approach to arise from the fact that the universe is not flrw on a particular scale of observations . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath31 is the scale of averaging and @xmath32 is an appropriate scale on which the universe is flrw , then @xmath33 as @xmath34 . for small @xmath35 , @xmath36 . a typical scale @xmath37 50 , a reasonable homogeneity scale is @xmath38 200 @xcite and the hubble radius @xmath39 3000 . for these values </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath40 is typically in the range @xmath41 to @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the size of this affect in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> robust estimators for intrinsic curvature fluctuations using realistically modelled clusters and voids in a swiss - cheese model indicates that the dark energy effects can be reduced by up to about 30 % @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the regional friedmann curvature estimated on the regional hubble scale can be large . </S>",
    "<S> a rough order of magnitude estimate for the variance implied by the observed density distribution of voids implies @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the value of the backreaction term @xmath14 depends on the velocity field inside the domain @xmath11 , it has been suggested that peculiar  </S>",
    "<S> velocity catalogues may offer an alternative way of estimating @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the backreaction parameter has also been estimated in the framework of newtonian cosmology @xcite ; it was found that the backreaction term can be quantitatively small in sufficiently large expanding domains of the universe ( e.g. , @xmath44 ) , but the dynamical influence of a non  vanishing backreaction on the other cosmological parameters can be large . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath45 can , in principal , be quite large .    this has suggested a possible scenario in which @xmath46 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is possible for the observed acceleration to be explained ( by backreaction ) using the standard interpretation of observational data without resorting to dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is probably fair to say that this possible scenario is not supported by most researchers in the field @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a heuristic argument that @xmath47 , which is consistent with cmb observations . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the fluctuation amplitude ; then @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the density contrast ) @xcite . from cmb data </S>",
    "<S> we then have that @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we have that @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , from perturbation theory the dominant local corrections to redshift or luminosity distance go as @xmath55 , which is only suppressed as ( @xmath56 ) ( rather than go as the newtonian potential @xmath57 as naively expected , which is suppressed as @xmath58 @xcite ; for scales as large as a few hundred mpc , the suppression is therefore mild , with @xmath59 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a second possible scenario in which @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be appreciated that this value for @xmath27 is very large and will still have a significant dynamical effect . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath61 , the energy density of radiation , and @xmath62 , the energy density in luminous matter . indeed , from nucleosynthesis bounds @xmath27 is comparable with @xmath63 , the total contribution of baryons to the normalized density .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two possibilities if @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps cosmological data can be explained without dark energy through a small backreaction and a reinterpreation of cosmological observations ; for example , many authors have studied observations in ltb models ( albeit with contradictory conclusions ) , and the subject is currently under intense investigation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , @xmath64 , but dark energy is still needed for consistency with observations . however , a value of @xmath65 would certainly necessitate a complete reinvestigation of cosmological observations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , such a value can not be naturally explained by inflation . from standard analysis , depending on the initial conditions and the details of a specific model of inflation , @xmath66 would be extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , any value for @xmath67 ( say ) would be very difficult to explain within the theory of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , inflation indicates that spatial curvature is effectively zero , so that any non - zero residual curvature ( e.g. , at the one percent level ) can only be naturally explained in terms of an averaging effect .    </S>",
    "<S> clearly , averaging can have a very significant dynamical effect on the evolution of the universe ; the correction terms change the interpretation of observations so that they need to be accounted for carefully to determine if a model may be consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> averaging may or may not explain the observed acceleration </S>",
    "<S> . however , it can not be neglected , and a proper analysis of cosmological observations will not be possible without a comprehensive understanding of the affects of averaging . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , any observation that is based on physics in the ( weakly or strongly ) nonlinear regime may well be influenced by the backreaction effect .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the cosmological observations further .    </S>",
    "<S> * the standard analysis of supernova type ia data and cmb data in flrw models can not be applied directly when backreaction effects are present , because of the different behaviour of the spatial curvature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , all data needs to be analysed within a particular inhomogeneous model , and not just an averaged version . </S>",
    "<S> several studies of the ltb model have demonstrated that the effect of inhomogeneity on the luminosity distance can mimic acceleration @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to carefully identify observables actually measured by an experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are several different measures of the expansion rate and acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , there is the question of whether we are dealing with regional dynamics or global ( averaged ) dynamics in any particular observation . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the hubble parameter @xmath68 and the hubble diagrams from supernovae type ia ( which need data at low redshift @xmath69 ) are clearly based on local measurements . however , most observations of the cmb ( e.g. , the integrated sachs - wolfe effect , which can be probed at @xmath70 ) and lss ( e.g. , n - body simulations ) are sensitive to large - scale ( averaged ) properties of the universe , rather than local ones . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , integrated affects presumably depend not only on averaged values of parameters ( e.g. , @xmath15 ) but also their actual values over an appropriate timescale . </S>",
    "<S> * all of our deductions about cosmology from observations are based on light paths . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of inhomogeneities affects curved null geodesics @xcite and can drastically alter observed distances when they are a sizable fraction of the curvature radius . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of light propagation in such an inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetime should be studied in the context of a realistic quantitative model . in the real universe , voids occupy a much larger region as compared to structures @xcite , hence for local observations light preferentially travels much more through underdense regions and the effects of inhomogeneities ( voids and structures ) on redshift and luminosity distance are likely to be significant .    _ </S>",
