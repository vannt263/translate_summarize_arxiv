    "magnetic reconnection is a physical process in plasmas which changes a magnetic field topology and releases stored magnetic energy .",
    "it is one of the central concerns in astrophysical , solar , space , fusion and laboratory plasmas ( e.g. , hones@xcite ; priest@xcite ) .",
    "a key question arising in the reconnection theory is that of the reconnection rate .",
    "so far there are two different magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models of reconnection based on the sweet ",
    "parker ( pure diffusion ) ( see parker@xcite ; sweet@xcite ) and the petschek ( slow shock energy conversion ) ( see petschek@xcite ) approaches .",
    "these models propose two different estimations of the reconnection rate  @xmath1 : the sweet ",
    "parker model predicts @xmath2 , and the petschek model gives @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the global magnetic reynolds number based on the half  length of a current layer @xmath5 , the alfvn velocity @xmath6 , and the resistivity of the plasma @xmath7 . for cosmic plasmas ,",
    "magnetic reynolds numbers usually are very large , therefore the petschek regime seems to be much more effective .",
    "however , since the petschek reconnection model was proposed , it is not clear what conditions are necessary to realize this regime .",
    "it is a fact that numerical simulations ( biskamp@xcite ; scholer@xcite ) carried out for a constant resistivity were not able to reproduce the solution of petschek type , instead , they were rather in favour of the sweet  parker solution .",
    "laboratory experiments also seem to observe the sweet  parker regime of reconnection ( ji et al.@xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if nonuniform resistivity is localized to a small region , the results of numerical simulations ( scholer@xcite ; ugai@xcite ) clearly show petschek  type reconnection with pronounced slow shocks . for the petschek regime , there are two physically different regions : a small diffusion region , where dissipation is important , is surrounded by a large convective zone where the plasma can be considered as ideal and dissipationless .",
    "the problem is very complicated and thus it does not seem realistic to obtain an analytical solution which is valid for both regions simultaneously . to simplify this problem ,",
    "we seek solutions separately , in the diffusion region and in the convective zone . for the later",
    ", a solution can be obtained analytically as an asymptotic series with respect to a small reconnection rate . for the diffusion region , it is impossible to find an analytical solution , and hence it has to be obtained numerically . in this semi  analytical approach , we have to combine the numerical solution for the diffusion region and the petschek analytical solution for the convective region .",
    "the latter can be done by different methods , which lead to absolutely identical results for the reconnection rate estimation .",
    "the estimation obtained by erkaev et al.@xcite is based on asymptotic matching of the diffusion region and convective zone solutions . in our present work , we use another way based on a regularized convective region solution , which seems to be rather clear and very close to the original petschek method . in this paper",
    "we give a detailed description of the numerical solution for the diffusion region , and derive the estimation for the reconnection rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sections ii and iii , we start with the steady - state mhd equations and present the petschek solution .",
    "the diffusion region scaling and boundary layer equations are introduced in section iv . the numerical algorithm and the results of the calculations are described in sections v and vi .",
    "the reconnection rate is derived in section vii , whereas section viii is devoted to the summary and discussion .",
    "mathematical details are described in the appendix .",
    "in the problem under consideration , the plasma is governed by the resistive steady  state mhd system of equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a mass density , @xmath10 is the total pressure , @xmath11 , and @xmath0 is the global magnetic reynolds number based on the maximal value of the resistivity @xmath12 .    outside of the diffusion region , in the so  called convection zone , dissipation is not important any longer , and we can use the ideal system of mhd equations in the limit @xmath13 .    in an incompressible plasma the following relations have to be satisfied at the shock front @xmath14 where the subscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote components normal and tangential to the shock front .",
    "the petschek solution , which is valid in the convection region , can be presented as follows ( petschek@xcite , for details see vasyliunas@xcite ) .",
    "we use coordinates @xmath17 , which are directed along the current sheet and in the perpendicular direction , respectively .",
    "the solution is completely determined by the following parameters : quantity @xmath5 which is the halflength of the current sheet , @xmath18 is the plasma inflow velocity , and @xmath19 is the initial magnetic field .",
    "the solution is presented in the form of asymptotic series with respect to the small parameter which is known as the reconnection rate @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the electric field which is constant in the 2d case under consideration , and @xmath22 is the alfvn electric field .",
    "inflow region : @xmath23    outflow region : @xmath24 the equation for the shock in the first quadrant is @xmath25 it can be shown that slightly outside of the shock from the inflow side @xmath26    expressions ( [ piv]-[pby ] ) are asymptotic solutions with respect to @xmath1 ( zero and first order terms in the inflow region and only zero order term in the outflow region ) of the ideal mhd system of equations ( [ 1mhd]-[3mhd ] ) and the rankine  hugoniot shock relations ( [ 4mhd]-[8mhd ] ) .",
    "petschek did not obtain a solution in the diffusion region , instead , he estimated the maximum reconnection rate as @xmath27 using some simple physical suggestions . generally speaking ,",
    "this implies that the petschek model gives any reconnection rate from the sweet ",
    "parker value @xmath28 up to @xmath27 , and for a long time , it was unclear whether petschek reconnection faster than sweet",
    " parker reconnection is possible .",
    "this problem can be solved by combining the analytical petschek solution ( [ piv]-[pby ] ) and the numerical model of the diffusion region .",
    "the next step is to find a numerical solution for the diffusion region .",
    "but first we have to obtain the boundary layer mhd equations suitable for the diffusion region .",
    "to this end we renormalize the mhd equations to new scales @xmath29 , where all quantities are supposed to be taken at the upper boundary of the diffusion region , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the characteristic length of the resistivity variation .",
    "the diffusion region length scale @xmath32 ( see figure 1 ) obtained from our numerical results ( section vii ) is of order of the scale @xmath31 .",
    "the convective electric field @xmath33 is zero in the centre of the diffusion region @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and then increases to the constant value @xmath21 at the boundary of the convection zone .",
    "this type of behaviour of the convective electric field is reasonable to be used for the definition of the size of the diffusion region which is one of the most important parameters of the problem .",
    "namely , the length scale of the diffusion region is determined as the distance between the origin @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the boundary where the convective electric field reaches its asymptotic value @xmath21 , or better to say , some level , for example , @xmath38 .    in the diffusion region where dissipation is essential",
    ", we adopt the dissipative mhd equations with the magnetic reynolds number @xmath39 and the normalized electric field @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a local reconnection rate at the diffusion region boundary .",
    "these electric field and local reconnection rate are not known .",
    "they are to be obtained from the numerical solution for the diffusion region .",
    "the scaling for the diffusion region is similar to that for the prandtl viscous layer ( landau and lifschitz @xcite ) and corresponds exactly to the sweet ",
    "parker one @xmath42 consequently , the new boundary layer variables are as follows @xmath43    the diffusion region reynolds number @xmath44 is certainly smaller then the global reynolds number @xmath0 , but still it is supposed to be @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in zero  order with respect to @xmath46 , the boundary layer equations turn out to be @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the normalized resistivity of the plasma with the maximum value to be 1 , @xmath49 is a small parameter , @xmath50 .",
    "the small terms which include @xmath51 at the right sides of the induction equations are necessary for numerical stability of the calculations .    it can be seen from equation ( [ 16a ] ) that the total pressure is constant across the diffusion region .",
    "this is a general feature of a boundary layer approximation .",
    "hence , the total pressure is defined inside the diffusion region by values at the boundary , and for the boundary layer equations ( [ 16][18 ] ) , the total pressure can be considered to be a given function of @xmath52 , e.g. , @xmath53 .    as it was pointed out ,",
    "the appropriate exact solutions of the boundary layer equations ( [ 16][18 ] ) are unknown even in the steady  state case , therefore , we have to solve the problem numerically .",
    "although we have to obtain a steady  state solution , from the point of view of simulation , it is advantageous to use a relaxation method and to solve numerically the unsteady system of the boundary layer mhd equations ( [ 16][18 ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that in the subset of equations ( [ 16b][17 ] ) , only two equations are independent . in principle",
    ", we can determine the normal component from the induction equation ( [ 16c ] ) or from the equation ( [ 17 ] ) providing the magnetic flux conservation .",
    "from the mathematical point of view , they are equivalent . in our numerical solution ,",
    "we use equation ( [ 17 ] ) to determine the @xmath54 component in the internal grid points , and the equation ( [ 16c ] ) is used as a boundary condition at the lower boundary .",
    "starting with an initial mhd configuration under fixed boundary conditions , we look for the convergence of the time  dependent solution to a steady state . to avoid additional numerical diffusion ,",
    "we do not use a flux function and a magnetic potential .",
    "the normalized total pressure is chosen to be 1 .",
    "the distribution of the resistivity @xmath55 is traditional ( scholer@xcite ; ugai@xcite ) @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "setting @xmath58 and @xmath59 we can model a case of localized resistivity , for @xmath60 and @xmath61 the resistivity is uniform .    as the initial configuration , we choose a current sheet with a linear profile of the magnetic field @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "the velocity components are assumed to be equal to zero at the initial moment , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .    to solve the mhd system numerically",
    ", we use a two step conservative finite difference numerical scheme with a rectangular grid @xmath66 in the first quadrant . from a time level ( @xmath15 ) , we calculate the parameters on the next time level @xmath67 in two steps . in the first step @xmath68 , diffusion is switched off , and we calculate the parameter at the intermediate points @xmath68 using the equations in characteristic form .",
    "this is similar to the approach used in the godunov method . in the second step ,",
    "we calculate the parameters at the next time level @xmath67 using the equations in conservative form and taking into account the diffusion terms approximated in implicit form .",
    "the details of the numerical algorithm are the following .",
    "the @xmath69 component is found from the @xmath52component of the induction equation @xmath70/\\tau + ( g_{i , k+1/2}^{n+1/2}-g_{i , k-1/2}^{n+1/2})/hx & = &   \\left[\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\tilde y}\\left ( \\eta(\\tilde x,\\tilde y)\\frac{\\partial   \\tilde b{_x}}{\\partial \\tilde y}\\right)\\right ] ^{n+1}_{i , k }    \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\mu \\left[\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial \\tilde y}\\left(\\eta(\\tilde x,\\tilde y)\\frac{\\partial \\tilde b_y } { \\partial \\tilde x } \\right)\\right]^{n+1}_{i , k } ,   \\label{nu1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath71 are determined by the method of characteristics on the level @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that at the beginning ( @xmath73 ) diffusion is switched off , and only convection acts , and then for given convection , diffusion is switched on , and @xmath69 is calculated on the level @xmath15 .",
    "the normal magnetic field component @xmath54 is determined from the equation @xmath74    the velocity component @xmath75 is found from the @xmath52component of the momentum equation ( [ 16 ] ) , @xmath76/\\tau + ( q_{y i , k+1/2 } - q_{y i , k-1/2})^{n+1/2}/hy+ ( q_{x i+1/2 , k } - q_{y i-1/2 , k})^{n+1/2}/hx = 0 , \\label{nu4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 here , the parameters @xmath78 are determined by the method of characteristics on the level @xmath72 simultaneously with the calculation of @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity component @xmath79 is determined from the equation @xmath80 .",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows : + at the upper ( inflow ) boundary , the tangential magnetic field component is assumed to be constant , @xmath69 = 1 and the tangential velocity component vanishes @xmath81 .",
    "+ at the left boundary we have the symmetry conditions , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath81 .",
    "+ at the right boundary we hold free conditions suitable for a uniform flow in the outflow region , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .    at the lower boundary ( @xmath37 )",
    "there is the symmetry condition for the tangential magnetic field component , @xmath86 , and the non  flow condition for the normal velocity component , @xmath87 . at this boundary",
    ", the normal component of the magnetic field @xmath54 is obtained from the induction equation ( [ 16c ] ) on the line @xmath37 , @xmath88 the small parameter @xmath89 is used here to regularize the numerical scheme for the unsteady system of the boundary layer mhd equations ( [ 16][18 ] ) , which is an ill  posed problem in our case .    the size of the computational domain is chosen to be much larger than the diffusion region size @xmath32 , and also much less than the global size @xmath5 . at the inflow boundary we do not fix the normal components of the magnetic field and velocity , and thus we do not impose a reconnection rate and an electric field in the diffusion region from the very beginning .",
    "the latter has to be found from the numerical solution self  consistently .",
    "to estimate the convergence of the time ",
    "dependent solution to a steady state for each @xmath15th time step , we use the following criteria , @xmath90 . in the 2d steady state the total ( convective plus dissipative ) electric field must be constant , and it is so in our simulations ( see figures 2 , and 3 ) besides of small perturbations near the outflow boundary due to some reflections , although we apply free boundary conditions .",
    "let us discuss the result of our simulations .",
    "for the case of localized resistivity , the system reaches the petschek steady state with clear asymptotic behaviour ( see figure 2 ) : @xmath91 in the outflow region ; @xmath92 at the inflow boundary ; @xmath69 decreases from 1 to 0 at the shock transition ; @xmath93 in the outflow region ; and @xmath94 from the inflow side of the shock ( compare with the petschek solution ( [ piv][psk ] ) ) .",
    "there is a well pronounced slow shock , as can be seen in the behaviour of all mhd parameters , but in particular in the distribution of the current density .",
    "the normalized electric field ( reconnection rate ) turns out to be @xmath95 .",
    "it is important to note that the numerical results do not depend on the size of calculation box .    on the other hand , for the case of homogeneous resistivity",
    ", the system reaches the sweet ",
    "parker state ( see figure 3 ) , even if the petschek solution is used as initial configuration ( see also scholer@xcite ; ugai@xcite ; uzdensky and kulsrud@xcite ) . this seems to imply that petschek ",
    "type reconnection is possible only if the resistivity of the plasma is localized to a small region , whereas for constant resistivity , the sweet ",
    "parker regime is realized ( erkaev et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the size of the diffusion region layer @xmath32 is defined as its length along the @xmath52 axis where the convective electric field at the lower boundary ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 is less in absolute value than some level of the total electric field ( say @xmath98 ) . for the case of a localized resistivity",
    ", @xmath32 practically coincides with the scale of the inhomogeneity of the resistivity @xmath31 when the maximum of resistivity is much larger then the background resistivity .",
    "therefore hereafter we consider @xmath99 .    for the case of uniform resistivity",
    ", the plasma is accelerated very slowly , and there is no obvious definition for the scale length of the diffusion region .",
    "diffusion is important everywhere for the pure sweet  parker regime , and for the petschek asymptotic solution there is left no room .",
    "therefore , the solution does not converge to the petschek solution , not only at the right hand boundary but everywhere . in this case",
    ", the solution will depend on the calculation box size because it does not have any other scale .",
    "hence , the constant resistivity solution can not be matched to the petschek solution .",
    "nevertheless , the sweet  parker regime is still important also for the petschek solution , because in the nearest vicinity of the reconnection line , where the resistivity can be considered to be constant , the diffusion region structure is similar to the sweet  parker case .",
    "besides , and this is even more important , the scaling for the diffusion region is exactly the sweet ",
    "parker one ( [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] ) , or , better to say , the prandtl scaling .",
    "to find a relationship between the reconnection rate and dissipation we need first of all an estimation of magnetic field at the boundary of the diffusion region @xmath100 . to this end",
    "we can not use the petschek solution ( [ pib ] ) because the @xmath101 component diverges at the origin @xmath102 , when @xmath103 .",
    "this singularity is a consequence of the fact that dissipation actually has not been taken into account for the petschek solution .",
    "formally it follows from the jump at the origin of the @xmath104 component of the magnetic field ( [ pby ] ) .",
    "dissipation evidently leads to smooth behaviour of the magnetic field in the diffusion region , and then no singularities are possible . to illustrate this we consider a model distribution of the @xmath105 component with linearly smoothed boundary condition at the interval @xmath106 similar to the original petschek@xcite consideration @xmath107        2\\varepsilon b_0 \\frac{x}{l_d } & |x| < l_d & \\\\[1 mm ]        0 & |x|>l & \\ , .",
    "\\end{array }   \\right.\\ ] ]    the @xmath108 component of the magnetic field in the inflow region can be found from the poisson integral , @xmath109 this solution does not have a singularity at the origin any more , and tends to the petschek solution ( [ pib ] ) outside the diffusion region .",
    "we can simplify equation ( [ bxr ] ) at the origin @xmath110 the first term on the right hand side of this equation is of the oder of @xmath111 , the third one is of @xmath112 , but the second term consists of a large parameter @xmath113 times the small parameter @xmath1 .",
    "thus we assume the following relations between the parameters @xmath114 so far we considered only a model distribution of the @xmath115 ( [ regcon ] ) along the current sheet but it turns out that @xmath116 does not depend on the actual distribution of the @xmath104 component inside the diffusion region up to @xmath112 .",
    "this implies that we can extend equation ( [ bx00 ] ) to the general case .",
    "let us consider the poisson integral with the actual distribution of the @xmath105 component using the model boundary condition @xmath117 ( [ regcon ] ) for regularization @xmath118 where @xmath119 includes both , the contribution from @xmath120 and the contribution from the non  singular integral in the third line of this equation .",
    "the main difficulty for the estimation of this integral is that near the diffusion region , the local petschek solution reproduced in our simulation , seems to be different from the global one because @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the local petschek solution has asymptotically @xmath123 when @xmath124 which seems to be different from the condition @xmath125 used in ( [ regcon ] ) .",
    "however , as it is shown in appendix , the difference @xmath126 is of the order of @xmath1 rather then @xmath127 ( see appendix ) .",
    "this allows us to estimate the integral ( [ bxreg ] ) as a quantity of order @xmath128 which is much smaller than the main term @xmath129 .",
    "the diffusion region is small @xmath130 and for the boundary condition for the diffusion region @xmath100 we can use the magnetic field at the origin @xmath116 . using the relation ( [ bxreg ] ) , we find the magnetic field strength at the diffusion region boundary @xmath131 now everything is ready to determine the reconnection rate",
    ". the electric field must be constant in the whole inflow region , hence @xmath132 where the definition of the reconnection rates @xmath133 are used .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath134 ( see scaling ( [ 12 ] ) ) we obtain @xmath135 substituting @xmath100 from equation ( [ 22 ] ) , we determine finally the following equation for the reconnection rate @xmath1 @xmath136 where the magnetic reynolds number @xmath137 is based on the global alfvn velocity and the half length of the diffusion region @xmath32 .",
    "the internal reconnection rate @xmath138 has to be found from the simulation of the diffusion region problem .    for small @xmath139",
    "there is an analytical expression @xmath140 here @xmath141 is an internal reconnection rate , determined from the numerical solution , which is @xmath142 for the petschek type solution .    in the appendix",
    "it is also shown that the global petschek solution with second order corrections tends to the asymptotic of the diffusion region solution for @xmath143 .",
    "it is interesting that for the derivation of the final result ( [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] ) the only value which has been actually used is the internal reconnection rate @xmath138 obtained from the numerical solution , and the asymptotic behaviour ( [ regcon ] ) .",
    "the actual distribution of the @xmath104 component along the upper boundary of the diffusion region does not contribute at all ( besides of the asymptotic behaviour ( [ regcon ] ) ) in zero ",
    "order approximation considered above . of course , from the mathematical point of view",
    ", it is important that the diffusion region solution exists and has the petschek  like asymptotic behaviour ( [ piv][pby ] ) .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic behaviour ( [ regcon ] ) plays the key role in the derivation of the reconnection rate and this question needs to be clarified in more detail .",
    "equations ( [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] ) give the unique reconnection rate for known parameters of the current sheet @xmath144 @xmath145",
    "@xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 . let us fix now the lengths @xmath5 and start to vary @xmath32 assuming @xmath149 .",
    "it is clear that for small @xmath32 , the petschek term becomes large , whereas for big @xmath32 , the sweet  parker term is dominant .",
    "the behavior of the implicit function @xmath150 given by ( [ 26 ] ) is non monotonic .",
    "there exists a length @xmath32 corresponding to a maximum value of the reconnection rate .",
    "this maximal reconnection rate is a function of the magnetic reynolds number given in an implicit form @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the constant @xmath153 . here",
    "@xmath0 is the reynolds number determined for the global scale and the maximal resistivity @xmath154 .",
    "this result can be interpreted as follows . in the case of a large global reynolds number , for fixed values of the maximum resistivity and the global scale @xmath5 ,",
    "the reconnection rate and the corresponding intensity of energy conversion reach their maxima when the diffusion region length scale and also the conductivity length scale are much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "this maximum value of the reconnection rate is a logarithmic function of the global reynolds number which is similar to that estimated by petschek .",
    "this fact contradicts to the usual electrotechnical intuition .",
    "for example , to get maximum heating from a rheostat ( resistor ) , we need to switch on the whole length , to increase @xmath32 , as oppose to the progress of reconnection .",
    "it is a fact that the energy release in the course of the reconnection process takes place not only in the form of joule heating in the diffusion region and at the shock fronts , but also in the form of plasma acceleration .    by increasing the conductivity length scale and the corresponding diffusion region length scale ,",
    "the reconnection rate decreases substantially , becoming more close to that of the sweet ",
    "parker regime .",
    "we have to emphasize once more that the case of constant resistivity is not described by equation ( [ 27 ] ) , because there is no clear scale of the diffusion region , no clear petschek  type asymptotic behaviour , and therefore it can not be matched with the petschek solution .",
    "the appearance of strongly localized resistivity is often the relevant case in space plasma applications , but for laboratory experiments , where the size of a device is relatively small , the petschek regime can hardly be expected .",
    "one of the main difficulties of the diffusive  like theories of reconnection such as the sweet ",
    "parker mechanism ( sweet , 1958 , parker , 1963 ) , and the tearing instability ( galeev et al . , 1986 ) is that the efficiency of the process turns out to be of the order of @xmath155 where usually @xmath156 .",
    "for example , for the sweet  parker regime , @xmath157 . in cosmic plasmas",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is often very large because of the large scale , high velocity and high conductivity .",
    "hence , the efficiency of pure dissipative processes is rather poor .",
    "the petschek mechanism of fast reconnection is much more effective due to the logarithmic dependence of the reconnection rate on scale ( 42 ) . in the petschek model ,",
    "mhd waves play the dominant role and the logarithmic dependence is the contribution of the waves to the efficiency of the process .    in this paper , we studied reconnection for a strongly localized resistivity with a large ratio of the maximal and background resistivity (  20 ) .",
    "a crucial parameter for the reconnection rate is the diffusion region length which is obtained to be approximately equal to the length scale of the resistivity .",
    "an interesting question for future study is the dependence of the diffusion region length as well as the electric field on the amplitude of the resistivity variation .",
    "so , we have to clarify the problem concerning the asymptotic behaviour @xmath158 when @xmath124 , estimate the integral , and to prove that the global petschek solution tends to the local one if we take into account all necessary terms . originally , petschek ( 1964 ) considered the reconnection problem using as a small parameter the reconnection rate @xmath1 .",
    "he obtained the solution ( [ piv]-[pby ] ) , taking into account only zero and first order terms in the inflow region , and zero order terms in the outflow region .",
    "but there is the possibility to extend this solution with higher order terms ( pudovkin and semenov , 1985 ) . in order to do this",
    "we have to present each component of the mhd state vector @xmath159 ( inflow region ) , @xmath160 ( outflow region ) , @xmath161 ( shock front ) as an asymptotic series with respect to the reconnection rate @xmath1 @xmath162 the terms of the series ( [ absser_i]-[absser_s ] ) can be obtained step by step using the mhd equations ( [ 1mhd]-[3mhd ] ) and the shock boundary conditions ( [ 4mhd]-[8mhd ] ) according to the following scheme , @xmath163 here @xmath164 is the initial vector , and each next term is determined via solving the reduced mhd system with boundary condition provided by the previous step .",
    "for example , the original petschek solution ( [ piv]-[pby ] ) corresponds to the first three steps of this scheme .",
    "the first step is trivial , because no shock front is yet possible . in the next step",
    ", the outflow region solution of zero order allows to impose a boundary condition problem for the inflow region solution in first order , and so on .    proceeding according to this scheme up to the step @xmath165 , we obtain the following extended petschek solution .",
    "inflow region : @xmath166    outflow region : @xmath167 where @xmath168 .",
    "shock front equation : @xmath169    finally it is possible to find the @xmath170component of the magnetic field @xmath171 at the shock which has been used in deriving the reconnection rate up to second order , @xmath172    using the extended petschek solution ( [ pfrom][obyb ] ) , we can prove now that the global solution tends to the local one at @xmath143 . from equations ( [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] ) it follows that @xmath173    let us check now that @xmath174 for @xmath143 at the inflow side of the shock .",
    "on one hand , we can expect that near the diffusion region @xmath175 on the other hand , for @xmath143 , the global solution tends to @xmath176 therefore @xmath174 , if we take into account the next term in the @xmath1 expansion for @xmath104 at the shock .",
    "this resolves the question concerning the asymptotic behaviour @xmath177 when @xmath124 .",
    "similarly it can be shown that the global petschek solution tends to the local one at the distance @xmath143 .",
    "this implies that all components of @xmath178 , @xmath179 are matched automatically near the boundary with the convection zone if one of them ( @xmath101 in our case ) has been adjusted properly .",
    "now we can estimate the integral used in equation ( [ regcon ] ) : @xmath180 the integral over the diffusion region @xmath181 is estimated as @xmath112 since @xmath182 is an odd function of @xmath52 , and the integral converges in the usual sense rather than to be calculated as a principal value .",
    "the contribution from the intervals @xmath183 and @xmath184 are estimated as @xmath185 because as it follows from equation ( [ 2by ] ) , the difference @xmath186 . taking into account the hierarchy of the small parameters ( [ parier ] )",
    "we conclude that the whole integral ( [ int ] ) is estimated as @xmath112 .",
