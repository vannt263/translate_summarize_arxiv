    "description of systems interacting via the so - called long - range interactions ( lri ) is an important statistical mechanics problem .",
    "these systems are found from very small to very large scales , for instance , in astrophysics  @xcite , plasma physics  @xcite , hidrodynamics  @xcite , atomic physics  @xcite and , nuclear physics  @xcite .    in order to use a precise definition of lri between a pair of particles , that are a distance @xmath3 apart , we consider the following : when the interaction potential between particles decays at long distances like @xmath4 in a space of @xmath2 dimensions ,",
    "the interaction can be considered to be long - range if @xmath5 . + this definition is a consequence of considering the energy @xmath6 of a given particle located at the center of a sphere of radius @xmath7 with a homogeneous particle distribution in @xmath2-dimensions . in order to exclude the divergence that appears at very short distances , the energy of the neighboring particles located inside a sphere of radius @xmath8 is neglected , @xmath6 is given by ,    @xmath9    @xmath10 ; \\qquad \\textrm{if } \\ l\\neq d;\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the generic particle density , @xmath12 is a coupling constant which guarantees the correct energy dimensions , and @xmath13 is the angular volume in the @xmath2-dimensional space .",
    "when @xmath7 is increased , @xmath6 remains finite only when @xmath14 ; such cases are the usual short - range interactions .",
    "the opposite corresponds to @xmath15 , where energy diverges for an increasing volume ; these are long - range interactions .",
    "examples of different long - range potentials are shown in figure 1 .",
    "notice that this particular definition could be different in the context of fluids theory .    in statistical mechanics ,",
    "most of the effort to obtain the equilibrium and non - equilibrium thermodynamic properties , has been concentrated on systems with short - range interactions .",
    "one of the main features of lri systems is that their total energy , under the pairwise additive approximation , is non - extensive , and as a consequence , is also non - additive  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the connection between boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics and classical thermodynamics is not straightforward , since the latter assumes that energy is an additive quantity  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", there is not a thermodynamic formalism ( independent of a statistical mechanics approach ) that allows this connection ; however , it is possible to start from a non - extensive statistical mechanics and to obtain a non - extensive thermodynamic formalism .",
    "+ perhaps a non - extensive version of statistical mechanics could be a more natural theoretical frame to study lri .",
    "a few proposals for bg statistical mechanics generalizations have been given  @xcite , however none of them are unanimously accepted .",
    "besides , the application of these generalizations to long - range potentials has been scarce .",
    "another approach is to make adjustments to the bg formalism to study these systems  @xcite .    in order to avoid the difficulties to treat lri mentioned above , in this work we present a first naive approach , but general , in the sense that it can be applied to a great variety of long - range potentials in the frame of bg statistical mechanics",
    "this methodology consists in rewritting a long - range potential as a short- range one , being the latter similar to the long - range potential in its graphical representation .",
    "we expect that this short - range potential recovers some features of the original one , however we know that this path leads to a classical thermodynamics frame and we do not know if real systems with lri are well represented by this thermodynamics . + more specifically our approach consists in expressing a given long - range potential as a ) a finite sum of yukawa potentials ; b ) a product of the potential with a damping function which depends on a parameter , that under a certain limit , the original potential is recovered .",
    "+ we have selected the discrete perturbation theory  @xcite ( dpt ) and the first - order mean spherical approximation  @xcite ( fmsa ) to study these potentials .",
    "these theories have been successfully applied in the context of fluids and more recently in the soft matter field , and can be applied to a great variety of potentials .    as an illustrative example",
    ", we have choosed the gravitational potential due to the interaction between two identical spherical rotating bodies ( ets potential ) , obtained by escamilla et al .",
    "more interesting models in the context of molecular liquids , could be , for instance , the coulomb interactions .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ theo ] ,",
    "we give a brief description of the ets potential and of the hard - core multi - yukawa ( hcmy ) and damped potential approaches . in section [ res ] we present internal energies , pressures , and vapor - liquid phase diagrams for the approximated potential .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] we give the main conclusions of this work .",
    "in the context of general relativity , within the weak - field limit methodology , an angular averaged potential due to the interaction between two identical spherical rotating bodies was proposed  @xcite .",
    "this interaction potential for hard - core spheres is given by @xmath16 , where :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the mass , @xmath20 is the angular momentum , @xmath21 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath22 is the diameter of particles , @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the potential evaluated at @xmath25 .",
    "this potential is purely attractive , nondivergent at short distances ( for @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , and keeps its long - range nature satisfying the condition given by ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "specific angular momentum @xmath28 is a parameter which modulates the intensity of the interaction .",
    "the long - range behavior is the same for any finite value of @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , in the limit of @xmath29 the ets potential goes to conventional @xmath30 newtonian gravitational interaction . in figure  2 , the ets and @xmath30 potentials are shown ; it can be noticed that the long - range behavior is the same for both of them .    to avoid the difficulties to evaluate thermodynamic properties for this long - range potential",
    ", we propose to rewrite the non hard - core potential part as : + 1 ) a finite sum of @xmath31 yukawa potentials ,    @xmath32}{x } ; \\quad \\textrm{\\textit{multi - yukawa approach},}\\ ] ]    with the energy and range parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , and + 2 ) a damped potential , which consists in the product of the original potential and a damping function @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the damping parameter that can be selected in order to guarantee that the approximated potential mimics the original one .",

    ",  @xcite as an improvement of the mean spherical aproximation ( msa )  @xcite .",

    "zernike integral equation under msa makes it possible to find analytical thermodynamic and structure expressions , which otherwise would require time - consuming numerical work . despite these advantages",
    ", msa may lose its solution in unstable regions  @xcite .",
    "an improvement of this theory is the first - order mean spherical approximation .",
    "+ fmsa solves analytically the radial distribution function ( rdf ) to first order in terms of inverse temperature .",
    "solutions obtained are explicit , simpler and always exist in unstable regions  @xcite .",
    "a successful application of fmsa theory was done by tang et al .",
    ",  @xcite to the yukawa and hcmy potentials .",
    "a finite sum of yukawa potentials can mimic other well - known potentials , like lennard - jones potential  @xcite or sticky hard spheres  @xcite ; however , its efficacy for lri like the ets potential has never been tested to our knowledge . in this work",
    "we will approximate the ets potential using hcmy potential to express it .",

    "the carnahan and starling eos  @xcite for @xmath46 is used ,    @xmath49    the first and second order perturbation terms , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined as    @xmath52    @xmath53    with @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",

    "the discrete perturbation theory was developed by benavides and gil - villegas  @xcite and has been successfully applied to different discrete and continuous potentials  @xcite .",
    "in particular torres - arenas et al .",
    "@xcite , have found that this approach accurately describes the thermodynamics of a hard - core attractive yukawa potential with @xmath59 , which represents a long - range potential in the context of molecular liquids ; however , it is a short - range interaction in the sense of ( [ eq1 ] ) . in this work , dpt will be used for even smaller values of @xmath60 .",
    "analogous to fmsa , dpt provides a recipe for the helmholtz free - energy of an arbitrary radial potential , re - expressing it as a sum of square - well and/or square - shoulder potentials . for a system of @xmath39 particles , contained in a volume @xmath40 at temperature @xmath41 ,",

    "the evaluation of ( [ eq11 ] ) can be simplified since square - well ( sw ) and square - shoulder ( ss ) potentials differ only in the sign of @xmath64 and the following relations are satisfied :    @xmath71    @xmath72    the problem is now reduced to calculate the free energy perturbation terms of the square - well potential .    in order to apply the dpt to a continous potential , a discrete version of the potential",
    "is required  @xcite .",
    "we used an approximation of the desired continous potential ( either the hcmy or the damped potential approach ) in terms of step functions , choosing the middle point on each step to evaluate the potential .",
    "+ for monotonic potentials without a defined range , dpt requires a cutoff ; this cutoff can be calculated by the condition @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the cutoff distance .",
    "this condition was successfully applied to yukawa potential  @xcite .    in the dpt approach ,",
    "the perturbation terms @xmath75 and @xmath76 , have been calculated from two theoretical equations : for @xmath77 , we used espndola et al . ,  @xcite and , for longer sw ranges , benavides and del ro expressions  @xcite .",
    "dpt requires the sw equation of state for all values of @xmath78 ; however , the eos proposed by espndola et al . , have problems for @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , in this work the number of discretizations , @xmath63 , is constrained to prevent an evaluation of the perturbation contributions for free energy @xmath80 and @xmath81 in @xmath82  @xcite , @xmath63 is determined by @xmath83 .",
    "the first proposal to study the thermodynamic properties of a long - range potential is to rewrite it as a finite sum of yukawa potentials .",
    "this goal can be achieved using the levenberg - marquardt method to perform a non - linear least squares fit  @xcite . + for the ets potential , we have found that three yukawa potentials are enough to describe it ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "notice that for both potentials , the long - range behavior is essentially the same and differences can be seen only at short distances .",
    "we expect that these short - range dicrepancies will be irrelevant for this type of potentials .",
    "the fitting was performed for the particular case of @xmath84 .",
    "the ets potential in the hcmy approach is given by ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath85 .",
    "corresponding parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".strength and range parameters for hcmy approach to the ets potential . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be seen , @xmath34 values are small , corresponding to long - range molecular potentials ; nevertheless , they are short - ranged if we consider definition given in ( [ eq1 ] ) . therefore , hcmy potential can be treated by the conventional methods of bg statistical mechanics . + in the frame of a linear theory , as is the case of fmsa , the problem is reduced to the knowledge of an eos for the hard - core attractive / repulsive yukawa potential of variable @xmath60 .",
    "yukawa eos have not been tested for such small @xmath60 values .",
    "results obtained in this work can also be used as a test of the reliability of fmsa and dpt in a domain of @xmath88 , far from the @xmath87 values commonly studied by liquid state community  @xcite .",
    "+ the reduced units that will be used are given by ,    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 are the reduced temperature , pressure , chemical potential , and density , respectively .    to estimate the accuracy of fmsa , compared with dpt for a hard - core attractive yukawa potential ( hcay ) with small values of the range parameter , we considered the case @xmath94 . for this value",
    ", dpt gives very good predictions@xcite . to our knowledge , it is the smallest value considered in simulation studies  @xcite .",
    "+ the results for a vapor - liquid phase diagram with fmsa , dpt and simulation are presented in figure  4 . both theories are in good agreement with simulation data .    with the performance test of fmsa and dpt done , we constructed vapor - liquid phase diagrams of the hcmy approach to the ets potential for @xmath84 . in figure  5 , vapor - liquid phase diagrams for both theories are presented .",
    "+ in the absence of simulation data for the thermodynamic properties of the ets potential , we present only a theoretical prediction of pressure and excess internal energy as a function of density , for several isotherms .",
    "the cutoff ( @xmath74 ) for the potentials used within dpt has been selected as @xmath95 that guarantees that the thermodynamic properties do not change significatively if the cutoff is increased .    in figure  6 and in figure  7 we present reduced pressure and excess internal energy as a functions of density , for the approximated predictions of fmsa and dpt theories of hcmy . in figure  6",
    "the selected isotherms were chosen around the critical temperature .",
    "for the case @xmath84 , coexistence isotherms ( showing a van der waals loop ) appear at very high temperatures ; which is a typical behavior for long - range potentials  @xcite .",
    "+ the corresponding excess internal energies shown in figure  7 , present the same ordinary functionality as the one exhibited by a short - range potential .      in order to illustrate the methodology given in ( [ eq4 ] ) for the ets potential , we have selected the damping function , @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "therefore the damped potential for @xmath97 , can be written as :    @xmath98}{\\arctan(\\alpha^*)}\\arctan\\bigg(\\frac{\\alpha^*}{x}\\bigg);\\ ] ]    where we considered the case @xmath84 .",
    "the parameter @xmath99 was estimated by solving ,    @xmath100    this equation guarantees that , in this approach , long - range first - order perturbation term ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 being the radial distribution function ) is equivalent to the one in the hcmy approach . in this way we avoided the divergence of this term , if the ets potential is used .",
    "it is important to remark that the previous condition is not the only possible one ; for instance , another potential that mimics the ets potential expressed in a different basis , could have been chosen instead of @xmath103 .    with this @xmath37 selection , in figure  8",
    "we show that damped and the ets potentials are very similar .",
    "this new potential will be studied using dpt . since there are no available simulation data for the ets potential , in the following figures we make a comparison between the two methodologies presented in this work .",
    "in figure  9 the vapor - liquid phase diagrams of damped potential and hcmy approximations to the ets potential are shown .",
    "as can be seen they give very similar predictions .",
    "+ in figure  10 and figure  11 , reduced pressures and excess internal energies as a function of density for damped potential and hcmy approaches are presented .",
    "it can be noticed that both methodologies are equivalent .",
    "in this work two different methodologies to study long - range potentials fluids from the point of view of bg statistical mechanics have been presented .",
    "these methods , hcmy and damped potential , are equivalent when used to predict the thermodynamic properties of a selected long - range potential ; however , simulation data is required to check their accuracy .",
    "a similar treatment can be applied to other long - range potentials .",
