    "the effective interaction is a key ingredient for the success of the nuclear shell model .",
    "once a reliable interaction is obtained , we can describe various nuclear properties accurately and systematically , which helps us to understand the underlying structure , and to make predictions for unobserved properties .",
    "the @xmath0 shell for orbitals @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a region where the shell model can play an indispensable role , and is at the frontier of our computational abilities . in the @xmath0 shell",
    "one finds the interplay of collective and single - particle properties , both of which the shell model can describe within a unified framework .",
    "since the protons and neutrons occupy the same major shell , the proton - neutron interaction is relatively strong and one can study related collective effects such as @xmath13 pairing .",
    "the @xmath0-shell nuclei are also of special interest from the viewpoint of astrophysics , such as the electron capture rate in supernovae explosions . for all these applications ,",
    "a suitable effective interaction for @xmath0-shell nuclei is required .",
    "because of the spin - orbit splitting , there is a sizable energy gap between the @xmath14 orbit and the other three orbits ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus there exists an @xmath1 or @xmath2 `` magic '' number inside the major shell with the oscillator quantum number @xmath18 . for shell - model calculations around this magic number",
    ", @xmath19ni has often been assumed as an `` inert '' core .",
    "however , it has been shown that this core is rather soft@xcite and the closed - shell model for the magic number 28 provides a very limited description especially for nuclei near @xmath1 or @xmath20=28 semi - magic .",
    "this `` active - two - shell '' problem is a challenge to both nuclear models and effective interactions .",
    "we shall discuss this point in this paper , and the word `` cross - shell '' refers to the @xmath1 or @xmath20=28 shell gap hereafter . because of such cross - shell mixing , it is necessary to assume essentially the full set of @xmath0 configurations and the associated unified interaction in order to describe the complete set of data and to have some predictive power .",
    "the effective interaction can in principle be derived from the free nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "in fact such microscopic interactions have been proposed for the @xmath0 shell @xcite with certain success particularly in the beginning of the shell .",
    "these interactions , however , fail in cases of many valence nucleons , e.g. , @xmath21ca @xcite and @xmath19ni . especially in the latter , the ground state is predicted to be significantly deformed in the full @xmath0-shell calculation , contrary to its known double - magic structure .",
    "it has been shown that modifications in the monopole part of the microscopic interaction can greatly improves the description of experimental data .",
    "in fact , kb3@xcite and kb3g@xcite interactions , which were obtained on the basis of the microscopic kuo - brown s g - matrix interaction@xcite with various monopole corrections , are remarkably successful for describing lighter @xmath0-shell nuclei ( @xmath22 52 ) . however , as we have pointed out@xcite , these interactions fail near @xmath19ni .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate to what extent the monopole modification is useful as a simple recipe for improvement of the microscopic interaction and to what extent one has to go beyond this .",
    "one feasible way of modifying the microscopic interaction for practical use is to carry out an empirical fit to a sufficiently large body of experimental energy data .",
    "in fact such a method has been successfully applied to lighter nuclei and has resulted in the `` standard '' effective interactions of cohen - kurath @xcite and usd @xcite for the @xmath23 and @xmath24-shells , respectively .    along this line , we have recently developed a new effective interaction called gxpf1@xcite for use in the @xmath0 shell .",
    "starting from a microscopic interaction , a subset of the 195 two - body matrix elements and four single - particle energies are determined by fitting to 699 energy data in the mass range @xmath25 .",
    "it has already been shown that gxpf1 successfully describes energy levels of various @xmath0-shell nuclei , such as the first @xmath26 states in even - even @xmath27 isotopes , low - lying states of @xmath28ni , and the systematics of the yrast @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 states in ni isotopes @xcite .",
    "therefore it is now important to analyze the wave functions and examine some electromagnetic properties to confirm further the reliability of the interaction .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present various results predicted by gxpf1 in order to clarify its applicability and limitation by comparing these results with experimental data .",
    "we also discuss what modifications of the microscopic interaction are needed in addition to the monopole corrections in order to obtain a better description of nuclear properties over the wide range of nuclei in the @xmath0 shell .",
    "in the derivation and previous tests of gxpf1 , the monte - carlo shell model ( mcsm ) @xcite played a crucial role , since at that time it was the only feasible way to obtain shell - model eigenenergies for many states in the middle of the @xmath0 shell . on the other hand , in the present paper , most of the results",
    "have been obtained by the conventional lanczos diagonalization method , which is now feasible with reasonable accuracy for most @xmath0-shell nuclei owing to recent developments of an efficient shell - model code and fast computers .",
    "we will confirm our previous mcsm results by comparison with those by such conventional calculations , but there are still places where the mcsm is necessary .",
    "the @xmath0 shell is the current frontier of conventional methods , while the mcsm is applicable and useful in much larger model spaces , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : int ] , the derivation of gxpf1 is reviewed and its general properties are analyzed in some detail . in section [ sec : result ] experimental data are compared with the results of large - scale shell - model calculations based on gxpf1 and some its possible modifications .",
    "we analyze the structure of wave functions focusing on the core - excitations across the @xmath1 or @xmath2 shell gap .",
    "a summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section , we first sketch how we have derived the gxpf1 interaction .",
    "the properties of gxpf1 is then analyzed from various viewpoints .",
    "an effective interaction for the @xmath0 shell can be specified uniquely in terms of interaction parameters consisting of four single - particle energies @xmath32 and 195 two - body matrix elements @xmath33 , where @xmath34 denote single - particle orbits , and @xmath35 stand for the spin - isospin quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath32 s include kinetic energies .",
    "we take the traditional approach of evaluating the interaction energy in zeroth - order perturbation theory for @xmath36 nucleons outside of a closed shell for @xmath37ca .",
    "we adjust the values of the interaction parameters so as to fit experimental binding energies and energy levels .",
    "we outline the fitting procedure here , while details can be found in @xcite . for a set of @xmath1 experimental energy data",
    "@xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath1 ) , we calculate the corresponding shell - model eigenvalues @xmath41 s . we minimize the quantity @xmath42 by varying the values of the interaction parameters .",
    "since this minimization is a non - linear process with respect to the interaction parameters , we solve it in an iterative way with successive variations of those parameters followed by diagonalizations of the hamiltonian until convergence .",
    "experimental energies used for the fit are limited to those of ground and low - lying states .",
    "therefore , certain linear combinations ( lc s ) of interaction parameters are sensitive to those data and can be well determined , whereas the rest of the lc s are not .",
    "we then adopt the so - called lc method @xcite , where the well - determined lc s are separated from the rest : starting from an initial interaction , well - determined lc s are optimized by the fit , while the other lc s are kept unchanged ( fixed to the values given by the initial interaction ) .    in order to obtain shell - model energies , both",
    "the conventional and mcsm calculations are used .",
    "since we are dealing with global features of the low - lying spectra for essentially all @xmath0-shell nuclei , we use a simplified version of mcsm : we search for a few ( typically three ) most important basis states ( deformed slater determinants ) for each spin - parity , and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix in the subspace spanned by these bases .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are improved by assuming an empirical correction formula , which is determined so that it reproduces the results of more accurate calculations for available cases .",
    "this method , the few - dimensional approximation with empirical corrections ( fda * ) , actually yields a reasonable estimate of the energy eigenvalues with much shorter computer time .    in the selection of experimental data for the fitting calculation , in order to eliminate intruder states from outside the present model space , we consider nuclei with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as a result 699",
    "data for binding and excitation energies ( 490 yrast , 198 yrare and 11 higher states ) were taken from 87 nuclei : @xmath45ca , @xmath46sc , @xmath46ti , @xmath47v , @xmath48cr , @xmath49mn , @xmath50fe , @xmath51co , @xmath52ni , @xmath53cu , @xmath54zn , @xmath55ga and @xmath56ge .",
    "we assume an empirical mass dependence @xmath57 of the two - body matrix elements similar to that used for the usd interaction @xcite , which is meant to take into account the average mass dependence of a medium - range interaction @xcite .",
    "we start from the microscopically derived effective interaction based on the bonn - c potential @xcite , which is simply denoted g hereafter . in the final fit ,",
    "70 well - determined lc s are varied , and a new interaction , gxpf1 , was obtained with an estimated rms error of 168 kev within fda*. the resultant single particle energies and two - body matrix elements are listed in table [ tbl : gxpf1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the previous subsections , it has been shown that gxpf1 properly describes the low - lying core - excitations .",
    "as discussed above , the effects of the core - excitations can be observed directly in the low - lying energy spectra of semi - magic nuclei , and therefore the description of such core - excited states plays a crucial role for the evaluation of the effective interaction . from this viewpoint , in this subsection",
    ", we discuss a specific problem with the gxpfm interaction : an interaction derived by adding empirical corrections to the microscopic g interaction only in the monopole part and pairing matrix elements ( see subsection [ sub : monofit ] ) . with the fda * estimate , the description of energy data by gxpfm appears to be poor especially for the yrare states of semi - magic nuclei .    as examples",
    ", we consider the low - lying energy levels of @xmath3mn and @xmath4fe , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gxm - lev ] for yrast and yrare states .",
    "details of the shell - model calculations are the same as those described in subsection [ sub : semi ] . for a comparison ,",
    "the results of gxpf1 are also shown .",
    "it can be clearly seen that , in both nuclei , the yrast states are described nearly equally well by both gxpf1 and gxpfm at least in the region of @xmath58 mev . on the other hand , several yrare states such as @xmath59 and @xmath60 in @xmath3mn and @xmath61 in @xmath4fe are predicted to be too low by gxpfm . according to the analysis of the shell - model wave functions ,",
    "these states are dominated by neutron core - excited configurations .",
    "typically 40% of these wave functions consist of neutron 2p-2h configurations relative to the @xmath62 core . in the case of gxpf1 ,",
    "such states are predicted with a similar structure , while their excitation energies are closer to the experiment .",
    "mn and ( lower ) @xmath4fe between the experimental data and the shell - model predictions by gxpfm and gxpf1 .",
    "[ fig : gxm - lev ] , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] mn and ( lower ) @xmath4fe between the experimental data and the shell - model predictions by gxpfm and gxpf1 .",
    "[ fig : gxm - lev ] , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    this fact suggests that the `` monopole + pairing '' correction works well for the description of the states in the lowest configuration and those with 1p-1h excitations relative to it , but it is not sufficient for treating the states which are dominated by the 2p-2h or more excited configurations .",
    "this is natural because , in the former states , the structure is expected to be `` single - particle '' like , especially for the semi - magic nuclei , and therefore such states can be described well by adjusting the monopole part only . on the other hand , in the latter states , the contribution of the multipole part should be more important , and multipole parts must be modified for their proper descriptions .",
    "thus , the core - excitations provides us with a clue to investigate corrections to the interaction that go beyond monopole plus pairing .",
    "in subsection [ sub : correc ] , it has been shown that major modifications of the microscopic interaction can be found in the diagonal parts which are not necessarily of monopole character .",
    "we have also shown in the previous subsection that the `` monopole + pairing '' correction is insufficient for describing the property of core - excitations .",
    "such insufficiency can be seen explicitly in the energy spectra of semi - magic nuclei .",
    "figure [ fig : ni5657 ] shows a part of the low - lying energy levels of @xmath19ni and @xmath63ni , where the results of gxpf1 , gxpfm and kb3 g are compared .",
    "the latter two interactions predict too high excitation energies for the @xmath64 state in @xmath19ni and the @xmath59 state in @xmath63ni . both of these excited states are dominated by the configuration with one nucleon excited from the @xmath14 orbit to the @xmath15 orbit .     in @xmath19ni and ( lower panel ) @xmath59 in @xmath63ni between the experimental data and the results of various effective interactions .",
    "the shell - model calculations were carried out in the @xmath65 and 6 truncated subspaces for @xmath19ni and @xmath63ni , respectively .",

    "[ fig : ni5657 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    we have found that in this case the most relevant matrix elements are @xmath66 , which are compared in fig . [ fig : v7373j1 ] for g , gxpf1 , gxpfm and kb3 g .",
    "it can be seen that the difference between g and gxpfm is primarily of monopole character ( constant shift ) .",
    "similar monopole corrections are present in kb3 g , although its original microscopic interaction is not g but kb , reflecting that g and kb are very close for these matrix elements . on the other hand , gxpf1 shows a rather different @xmath67-dependence from these `` monopole - corrected '' interactions gxpfm and kb3 g , especially for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 matrix elements .",
    "the former is more attractive and the latter more repulsive by about 0.3 mev .",
    "note that these differences keep the monopole centroid quite similar value for these interactions as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : centroid ] and [ fig : centroid - gxpfm ] .     between various effective interactions .",
    "[ fig : v7373j1 ] , width=321 ]    in order to examine to what extent such differences affect the energy spectra , similar calculations have been carried for both gxpfm and kb3 g interactions , by modifying the @xmath68 matrix element to be more attractive by 0.300 mev and @xmath69 to be more repulsive by 0.245 mev so that the monopole centroid is kept unchanged .",
    "the modified interactions are denoted as gxpfm and kb3g , respectively .",
    "the results are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : ni5657 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the description is improved in both gxpfm and kb3g , although it is not enough for the latter .",
    "this fact highlights the importance of modifications of the microscopic interaction that go beyond the monopole type .",
    "the above @xmath67-dependent modifications in gxpf1 can be understood to a good extent in terms of a quadrupole - quadrupole interaction @xmath70^{(2 ) }   \\cdot[(p_{3/2})^\\dagger(\\tilde{f}_{7/2})]^{(2)}$ ] .",
    "the matrix elements of this interaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v7373j1 ] , which give similar @xmath67-dependence to that of the difference between gxpf1 and gxpfm . indeed",
    ", the @xmath66 s can be obtained by recoupling this interaction with the strength @xmath71 mev for gxpf1 together with other multipoles with minor contributions , while this strength turns out to be @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 mev for gxpfm , kb3 g and g , respectively .",
    "this quadrupole correction can arise from a core - polarization diagram where the external lines are @xmath14 and @xmath15 with exchange between them and the bubble of @xmath75 is involved .",
    "if this is the case , the coupling should be particularly strong in this channel and/or the energy denominator should smaller , as compared to what is assumed in the microscopic calculation of effective interaction .",
    "this is an intriguing problem of the effective interaction , and further studies are needed .",
    "summarizing this paper , the effective interaction for @xmath0-shell nuclei , gxpf1 , has been examined and tested from various viewpoints .",
    "it was obtained by adding empirical corrections to the microscopic interaction derived from the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the corrections were determined through the systematic fitting to experimental energy data .",
    "the most significant modifications are those for the monopole and pairing parts of the hamiltonian the monopole plus pairing corrections give a substantial improvement , but are not sufficient for the description core - excitations over the @xmath1 or @xmath2 shell gap .",
    "other modifications are necessary including some which can be related to the quadrupole - quadrupole component .    the analysis of the ground - state wave functions obtained by gxpf1 shows that the assumption of an inert @xmath19ni core is not realistic even for the ni isotopes .",
    "thus , the amount of core - excitations strongly depends on both valence proton and neutron numbers relative to the core .",
    "the calculated binding energies agree with the experimental data quite well over a wide mass range even for many nuclei which were not included in the fit .",
    "however , in neutron - rich nuclei ( @xmath76 ) around @xmath7724 , the difference between theory and experiment becomes larger , suggesting a need for including the @xmath78 orbit for describing large deformation .",
    "such a discrepancy can also be seen in the calculated @xmath64 excitation energy for @xmath79cr , which is predicted too high in comparison to the recent experimental data .",
    "the description of the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments is basically successful with a few exceptions .",
    "the most remarkable difference between theory and experiment can be found in the @xmath64 states of zn isotopes , which also suggests influence of the @xmath78 orbit . as for the electric quadrupole moments ,",
    "more precise experimental data are desired to discuss the quality of description especially for ni and zn isotopes .",
    "the energy spectra and electro - magnetic transition matrix elements for @xmath1 or @xmath2 semi - magic nuclei have been calculated and compared with experimental data .",
    "the effects of the core - excitation across @xmath1 , @xmath2 shell gap can be seen already in the non - yrast states around @xmath80 3 mev as well as high spin yrast states .",
    "the present results show the reliability of gxpf1 even in the cases that the core - excitation plays a crucial role . considering the current experimental and theoretical situations",
    ", it would be difficult to explore such significantly core - excited states in other nuclei with more `` valence '' particles or holes relative to @xmath19ni core , due to the explosive increase of the low - lying level density .",
    "therefore the description of @xmath19ni and neighboring nuclei is an important test of the effective interaction .",
    "it has been shown that the reasonable description of @xmath7 odd - odd nuclei can be obtained by gxpf1 , indicating its proper isospin dependent structure , although the experimental data are limited especially for the transitions .",
    "most of shell - model calculations were done in the conventional method so as to reach higher accuracy .",
    "the truncations were carefully examined to be accurate enough and for the data we compare with . in some shape coexistence cases ,",
    "strongly deformed states appear at lower energies , where the monte - carlo shell model still produces more accurate results as compared to large - scale conventional calculations with high ( i.e. , unrestrictive ) truncations .",
    "thus , one has to be cautious in using conventional calculations for such cases .",
    "this may be an important lesson for further studies on heavier nuclei with more developed collectivity .",
    "further applications to unexplored regimes of large proton / neutron numbers or high excitation energy is of great interest .",
    "future experiments will test the predictions and provide guidance for further improvements in the interaction .",
    "this work has been supported in part by grant - in - aid for specially promoted research ( 13002001 ) from the japanese ministry of education , science , culture , sport and technology .",
    "shell - model calculations were performed largely on the parallel computer system at cns and on the alphleet computer of riken .",

    "<S> the effective interaction gxpf1 for shell - model calculations in the full @xmath0 shell is tested in detail from various viewpoints such as binding energies , electro - magnetic moments and transitions , and excitation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - magic structure is successfully described for @xmath1 or @xmath2 nuclei , @xmath3mn , @xmath4fe , @xmath5co and @xmath6ni , suggesting the existence of significant core - excitations in low - lying non - yrast states as well as in high - spin yrast states . </S>",
    "<S> the results of @xmath7 odd - odd nuclei , @xmath4co and @xmath8cu , also confirm the reliability of gxpf1 interaction in the isospin dependent properties . </S>",
    "<S> studies of shape coexistence suggest an advantage of monte carlo shell model over conventional calculations in cases where full - space calculations still remain too large to be practical . </S>"
