    "its importance in qcd has ensured that the possibility of dcsb in qed3 has received much attention .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) provide a natural framework within which to explore this and related phenomena .",
    "these methods are reviewed in refs.@xcite .",
    "interest was stimulated by a finding @xcite that in qed3 with @xmath1 massless fermions a truncated system of dses yields a critical number of flavours , @xmath0 , such that dcsb is only possible for @xmath2 .",
    "a debate has subsequently ensued , which focuses on the reliability of the truncations employed and offers an alternative possibility ; namely , that the mass function does not vanish at some critical number of flavours but is instead exponentially suppressed with increasing @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our analysis is intended to crystallise the issues and thereby eliminate the points of contention .",
    "it is worth remarking that lattice - regularised qed3 can currently state only that @xmath3 , if it exists at all @xcite .",
    "an impediment to reliable lattice calculations is the mass hierarchy feature of qed3 ; viz .",

    ", qed3 is also of interest in condensed matter physics as an effective field theory for high - temperature superconductors @xcite and graphene @xcite . naturally , the nature of the theory at @xmath5 is most interesting for true electronic systems .",

    "in addition , we introduce a model - independent order parameter for deconfinement and demonstrate simultaneity of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement .",

    "in three dimensions there are two inequivalent @xmath6 representations of the euclidean clifford algebra @xmath7 .",
    "hence , two - component spinors are sufficient to describe spinorial representations of the lorentz group . in this case",

    "they are coupled to each other and to equations that we have not written explicitly ; e.g. , that for the fermion - photon vertex , @xmath21 . in order to draw reliable conclusions from the analysis of these equations",
    "a systematic and nonperturbative truncation scheme should be employed .",

    ", we consider it important to discuss whether there is a special choice of gauge parameter for which eq.([rainbow ] ) is most sound .",

    "landau gauge , @xmath28 , occupies this special place . in landau gauge the one - loop contribution to @xmath29 vanishes in any number of dimensions @xcite . owing to the simplest ward - takahashi identity",
    ", this feature amplifies the domain whereupon eq.([rainbow ] ) can be described as a pointwise accurate approximation . additionally , in the context of the reasonable vertex _",
    "@xcite that have been employed in dse studies , this means that sensitivity to model - dependent differences between the forms is least noticeable in landau gauge .",
    "whenever it is relevant , @xmath28 is a fixed point of the renormalisation group ; i.e. , the gauge parameter is momentum - independent .",
    "indeed , it is always zero .",
    "numerous studies have tried to construct a model vertex that guarantees gauge covariance of the fermion propagator @xcite and the photon vacuum polarisation @xcite in qed3 and qed4 .",
    "the lesson in the observations above is that such attempts are misguided .",
    "suppose a landau gauge _ ansatz _ is truly correct , then its form in any other gauge is precisely reproduced by the lkf - transform . if , on the other hand , the _ ansatz _ is wrong , then its in - built dependence on the gauge parameter will not be better than that which is obtained by defining the vertex in different gauges via the lkf transform .",
    "hence there is nothing to be learnt from exploring the gauge parameter dependence of quantities obtained with a given vertex _",
    "ansatz_. in addition to that implicit in the fermion propagator which arises through resolving the ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "] our view is that irrespective of the choice made for @xmath21 , and there are good reasons to employ something more sophisticated than eq.([rainbow ] ) , the landau gauge results define the model entirely .      in ref.@xcite , in conjunction with free massless fermion propagators , @xmath30 , eq.([rainbow ] )",
    "was used in eqs.([pimn ] ) and ( [ pidse ] ) to obtain @xmath31 this result was subsequently inserted into eq.([gendse ] ) via eq.([dprop ] ) and , subject to the further truncation @xmath32 , an equation for @xmath33 obtained ; viz .",

    "the other widely canvassed possibility is that the mass function does not vanish but is instead merely exponentially suppressed with increasing @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "one aim of the following analysis is to eliminate the points of contention .    given that @xmath37 must be a monotonically decreasing function in qed3 , our first observation is that a critical number of flavours , @xmath0 , can only exist in the massless theory if in the neighbourhood of this value @xmath38 to establish this , consider the opposite ; namely , @xmath39 , for some @xmath40 . under the conditions",
    "just described @xmath41 equation  ( [ gendse ] ) can only support a gap if the kernel possesses sufficient support .",
    "a lower bound on the support is obtained by employing the replacement : @xmath42 .",
    "the equation thus obtained is actually the same as the quenched equation except for a rescaling of the coupling ; viz . , @xmath43 .",
    "in the quenched theory the coupling serves merely to set a mass - scale and has no effect on whether or not chiral symmetry is dynamically broken .",
    "thus , if chiral symmetry is not broken for @xmath39 , then there exists a @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and chiral symmetry is still unbroken .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 can not be a critical number of flavours .",
    "hence no monotonically decreasing function satisfying @xmath46 , @xmath47 can generate a critical number of flavours .    if a theory possesses a critical number of flavours , then in the chiral limit and for @xmath48 one can neglect in the schwinger functions all instances of feedback associated with @xmath49 .",

    "no term is present that can drive the appearance of another structure .",
    "this entails that the equations for @xmath29 and @xmath37 form a closed , coupled pair , one whose solutions will only ultimately influence the result for @xmath53 .",
    "consider eqs.([ab0 ] ) and ( [ pib0 ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ pipert ] ) describes the polarisation for @xmath54 , on which domain one also has @xmath55 .",
    "however , it is the behaviour of these functions for infrared momenta , @xmath56 , that is crucial to the existence or otherwise of a gap .",
    "reference  @xcite indicates the possibility that in the absence of an explicit or dynamically generated fermion mass , @xmath29 can possess homogeneous power - law behaviour in the infrared whilst nevertheless satisfying its perturbative ultraviolet limit .",
    "we therefore consider the implications of @xmath57    homogeneity entails @xmath58 .",
    "from this , the absence of a fermion mass and , importantly , the ward identity , it follows that @xmath59 subject to these considerations , inspection of eq.([pib0 ] ) reveals that infrared momenta dominate the integration domain therein",
    ". therefore @xmath60 nb .",
    "dominance of infrared momenta can not be argued for @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , eq.([piir ] ) is consistent with eq.([pincr ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ ab0 ] ) has a constant term on the left - hand - side .",
    "this is plainly the driving term associated with the ultraviolet behaviour @xmath62 , @xmath54 , and therefore can not have any impact on the infrared behaviour of @xmath29 , a result illustrated clearly in ref.@xcite .",
    "hence , focusing on momenta within the infrared domain , we substitute eqs.([air ] )  ( [ piir ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ ab0 ] ) and find @xmath63 namely an internally consistent result .",
    "the value of @xmath64 depends on the exact form of the dressed - fermion - photon vertex @xcite , which is not completely constrained by the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "it is thus evident that if there exists a critical number of flavours , @xmath0 , then for @xmath48 the fermion wave function renormalisation function and the photon vacuum polarisation are , for infrared momenta , homogeneous functions .",

    "the converse can also be argued from eqs.([gendse ] ) and ( [ pidse ] ) . if there exists a value of @xmath0 such that for @xmath48 @xmath29 and @xmath37 are homogeneous functions at infrared momenta , then at this value of @xmath0 chiral symmetry",
    "is not broken .",
    "this is plain because dcsb would introduce an infrared mass - scale , @xmath66 , and the wave function renormalisation and vacuum polarisation would saturate at some constant value for momenta less than this scale .",

    "these results have an important impact on eq.([bb0 ] ) ; namely , for any value of @xmath64 , @xmath68 an _ infrared collusion _ is apparent in the theory : the infrared anomalous dimensions of the wave function renormalisation and vacuum polarisation cancel from the equation for the scalar self energy and the scaling behaviour of the integrand is @xmath69 . once again , the ward identity driven result in eq.([gammair ] ) is essential for this to occur .",

    "it is apparent that a critical number of fermion flavours exists if , and only if , the vacuum polarisation and vertex dressing conspire at infrared momenta to completely eliminate the influence of the fermion s vector self - energy from the equation for the scalar self - energy .",
    "otherwise , @xmath84 is merely suppressed exponentially with increasing @xmath1 .    the solid curves in fig.[fig1 ]",

    "this can be understood via fig.[qpol ] , which depicts the vacuum polarisation of eq.([cjbpol ] ) .",
    "as we advertised , the polarisation acquires a dependence on @xmath1 because a suppression of @xmath33 feeds back into the polarisation through @xmath86 .",
    "this mocks up a simultaneous self - consistent solution of the fermion and photon gap equations .",
    "the domain on which @xmath37 differs from the @xmath35-result in eq.([pipert ] ) shrinks with increasing @xmath1 , until at @xmath85 , owing to the calculated self - consistent feedback , it no longer contributes measurably to the fermion gap equation .",
    "thereafter , this gap equation s solution also follows the @xmath35-result .",
    "the following observations are relevant .",
    "it is @xmath87 in eq.([cjbpola ] ) that self - consistently realises eq.([piir ] ) .",
    "also , in the upper panel of fig.[fig1 ] , which depicts @xmath88 , the solid and short - dash - dot curves do not lie upon one another because of the normalisation factor in eq.([sigmarho ] ) : it is plain from the figure that our _ anstze _ yield a @xmath77 result for the mass function which is larger than that obtained in a @xmath35 expansion .",
    "the curves are indistinguishable if for @xmath89 we normalise our solution via the @xmath77 result obtained using the @xmath35 expansion .",

    "the figure demonstrates that when internally consistent feedback is enabled , chiral symmetry is not dynamically broken and the fermions are not confined for @xmath109 .",
    "plainly , the chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement transitions are simultaneous in our illustrative model .",
    "the basic causal connection is a dramatic change in the analytic properties of the propagator which accompanies the disappearance of a nonzero fermion scalar self - energy .",
    "it is noteworthy that dse studies of qcd , in rainbow - ladder truncation with the model kernel of ref.@xcite , find the same results for these transitions at @xmath110 @xcite and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "in addition , ref.@xcite describes a model that exhibits a line of simultaneous transitions in the physical quadrant of the @xmath112-plane .",
    "indeed , deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are coincident in all self - consistent studies of concrete models of continuum qcd that exhibit both phenomena , and in numerical simulations of lattice - regularised qcd @xcite .",
    "the methods described herein could be employed to extend the study of qed3 at nonzero-@xmath112 in ref.@xcite , and explore whether and under which conditions chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement are coincident .",
    "we argued that qed3 can possess a critical number of flavours , @xmath0 , above which dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is impossible if , and only if , in the neighbourhood of @xmath0 the fermion wave function renormalisation and the photon vacuum polarisation are homogeneous functions at infrared momenta .",
    "the ward identity guarantees that the fermion - photon vertex also possesses the homogeneity property and ensures a simple relationship between the homogeneity degrees ( anomalous dimensions ) of each of these functions .",
    "one can not , however , conclude from this analysis that qed3 must possess a critical number of flavours .",
    "the existence and value of @xmath0 are contingent upon the precise form of the fermion - photon vertex . notwithstanding this , it is noteworthy that all extant studies which employ a reasonable vertex _ ansatz _ and treat qed3 s gap equations consistently yield a value @xmath113 .",
    "it is therefore almost certain that chiral symmetry is dynamically broken for @xmath5 qed3 , the number relevant in condensed matter applications of the theory .",
    "while our analysis does not establish the existence of @xmath0 it does obviate any further debate on the question of whether the fermion mass vanishes at some finite @xmath1 or is merely exponentially damped with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "we have elucidated the conditions under which a critical number of flavours can exist and the mechanism by which it then arises ; viz .",
    ", infrared collusion .",
    "all extant studies that report an exponential suppression of @xmath114 have suppressed that mechanism .",
    "our discussion should also forestall any further consideration of the gauge dependence of @xmath0 and other physical quantities .",
    "we have made plain that landau gauge occupies a special place in gauge theories .",
    "it is the gauge in which any truncation or sound _ ansatz _ for the fermion - photon vertex can most reasonably be described as providing a pointwise accurate approximation .",
    "the vertex in any other gauge should then be defined as the landau - khalatnikov - fradkin transform of the landau gauge _",
    "ansatz_. the sensible implementation of this procedure guarantees gauge covariance and hence renders moot any question about the gauge dependence of gauge invariant quantities .    in order to illustrate our arguments",
    "we employed a simple model for the photon vacuum polarisation and fermion - photon vertex . within this model we calculated @xmath0 and the infrared anomalous dimension .",
    "furthermore , we introduced a new , model - independent order parameter for the confinement of elementary excitations . in our model deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration",
    "are coincident at @xmath0 .",
    "this owes to an abrupt change in the analytic properties of the @xmath93-point fermion schwinger function when a nonzero scalar self - energy becomes impossible .",
    "it is plausible that this mechanism and result persist in qed3 proper and , indeed , in general .",
    "we remark in closing that all the lessons learnt in this study are relevant to qcd .",
    "the simplest points are that landau gauge is of particular utility ; and confinement and dcsb might in general be tied to , and connected via , the analytic structure of the fermion propagator , which itself is strongly influenced by the possibility of a dynamically generated scalar self - energy .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    we establish that qed3 can possess a critical number of flavours , @xmath0 , associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking if , and only if , the fermion wave function renormalisation and photon vacuum polarisation are homogeneous functions at infrared momenta when the fermion mass function vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the ward identity entails that the fermion - photon vertex possesses the same property and ensures a simple relationship between the homogeneity degrees of each of these functions . </S>",
    "<S> simple models for the photon vacuum polarisation and fermion - photon vertex are used to illustrate these observations . </S>",
    "<S> the existence and value of @xmath0 are contingent upon the precise form of the vertex but any discussion of gauge dependence is moot . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an order parameter for confinement . </S>",
    "<S> chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement are coincident owing to an abrupt change in the analytic properties of the fermion propagator when a nonzero scalar self - energy becomes insupportable . </S>"
