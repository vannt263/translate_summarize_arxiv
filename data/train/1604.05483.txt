    "wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) is a new communication paradigm , where wireless devices extract information and energy from the received radio - frequency ( rf ) signals @xcite . due to practical limitations",
    ", swipt can not be performed from the same signal without losses and practical implementations divide the received signal in two parts ; one part is used for information transfer and another part is used for power transfer @xcite . in this work , we focus on the power splitting ( ps ) technique , where the signal is split into two separate streams of different power @xcite .",
    "the time - splitting technique , where swipt is performed in the time domain , is a special case of ps with a binary power splitting parameter and therefore is excluded in our analysis .    due to the importance of path - loss degradation on swipt systems , recent works study swipt from a large - scale point of view by taking into account the spatial randomness of the network deployment @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the location of the devices and/or base stations is mainly modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( hppp ) in the 2-d space . to further boost the information / power transfer , directivity gains through antenna sectorization",
    "is introduced as a promising technology .",
    "sectorized antennas not only efficiently handle multi - user interference through spatial separation @xcite , but also facilitate wireless power transfer in environments with poor propagation characteristics @xcite .",
    "however , most of the work on swipt with / without sectorized antennas is limited to 2-d networks and does not consider recent 3-d deployments .    a first effort to analyze the performance of a 3-d network is presented in @xcite , where the authors study the coverage probability for a 3-d large - scale cellular network with omnidirectional antennas . on the other hand ,",
    "recent standardization activities ( e.g , 3gppp ) focus on full - dimension multiple - input multiple - output technology , where antenna elements are placed into a 2-d planar array in order to achieve spatial separation to both the elevation and the traditional azimuth domains @xcite .",
    "the employment of 3-d antenna sectorization on 3-d networks with geometric randomness is a new research area without any previous work .    in this letter",
    ", we study antenna sectorization for 3-d bipolar ad hoc networks with swipt - ps capabilities .",
    "conventional 2-d sectorized models @xcite are extended to capture spatial separation in the horizontal domain as well as the vertical domain .",
    "the impact of 3-d sectorized antennas on the achieved information and power transfer is evaluated by using stochastic geometry tools .",
    "closed - form expressions as well as asymptotic simplifications are derived for the success probability and the average harvested energy .",
    "we reveal that 3-d antenna sectorization is a useful tool for 3-d networks and the associated additional degree of freedom ( i.e. , vertical spatial separation ) achieves a higher information / power transfer than conventional antenna configurations .",
    "the main contributions of this letter are the development of a new 3-d antenna sectorization model for 3-d networks and its study in the context of swipt .",
