    "clusters of galaxies , being perhaps the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe , are expected to contain a significant amount of baryons of the universe . moreover , due to their large angular sizes , observational estimates of their total mass @xmath1 , the gas mass @xmath2 and hence the gas mass fraction ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) are easier .",
    "these estimates can be used as probes of large scale structure and underlying cosmological models .",
    "for example , the cluster @xmath3 would give a lower limit to the universal baryon fraction @xmath5 .",
    "determination of @xmath3 has been done by numerous people ( white & fabian , 1995 ; mohr 1999 ; sadat & blanchard , 2001 ) and the values are in agreement within the observational scatter .",
    "a point to be noted here is that the estimated @xmath3 depends on the distance to the cluster ( i.e @xmath3 @xmath6 ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath3 is assumed to be constant , then in principle , one can use the ` apparent ' evolution of @xmath3 over a large redshift range to constrain cosmological models ( sasaki 1996 ) .",
    "the question as to whether there is any evolution ( or constancy ) of gas mass fraction , however , is still debatable , with claims made either way .",
    "for example , schindler ( 1999 ) has investigated a sample of distant clusters with redshifts between 0.3 to 1 and conclude that there is no evolution of the gas mass fraction .",
    "similar conclusion has been drawn by grego ( 2000 ) .",
    "on the contrary , ettori and fabian ( 1999 ) have looked at 36 high - luminosity clusters , and find evolution in their gas mass fraction ( in both scdm and @xmath7cdm universes ) .",
    "see also david , 1995 ; tsuru 1997 ; allen & fabian , 1998 ; mohr 1999 ) .",
    "observations suggest that , though @xmath3 of massive clusters",
    "( @xmath8 ) appears to be constant , low mass clusters with shallower potential wells may have lost gas due to preheating and/or post - collapse energy input ( david 1990 , 1995 ; ponman 1996 ; bialek 2000 ) .",
    "it is also well known that icm is not entirely primordial and there is probably continuous infall of gas , thereby , increasing @xmath3 with time .",
    "thus , there is considerable debate regarding the evolution of gas mass fraction .",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) has been probed mainly through x - ray observations , but also through the so called sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( zeldovich & sunyaev , 1969 ) in the last decade ( see birkinshaw 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the sze effect from clusters is a spectral distortion of the cmb photons due to inverse compton scattering by the hot icm electrons , with its magnitude proportional to the compton @xmath9-parameter , given by @xmath10 .",
    "here , @xmath11 is the boltzman constant , @xmath12 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath13 is the electron mass , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the icm electron density and the temperature . using bolometric sze measurements ,",
    "the @xmath3 has been obtained for a number of clusters ( see birkinshaw 1999 ) .",
    "recently , grego ( 2000 ) have made interferometric observations of sze from a sample of 18 clusters .",
    "a major advantage of sze over x - ray measurements is , sze does not suffer from the @xmath16 ` cosmological dimming ' , which makes sze an useful probe of evolution of cluster gas mass fraction .",
    "other than the targeted sze observations , non - targeted ` blank sky ' surveys of sze are one of the main aims of future satellite and ground based small angular scale observations ( holder & carlstrom , 1999 ; or with amiba ) .",
    "once the power spectrum is extracted from observations , comparison can be made with theory , to constrain cosmological parameters and relevant cluster scale physics .",
    "the sze power spectrum as a cosmological probe has been well studied ( refregier , 1999 ; komatsu & kitayama , 1999 ) , although its use as a probe of icm has seldom been looked at .    keeping such surveys in mind , in this _ letter _",
    ", we look at the sze power spectrum as a probe of the icm .",
    "we show it to be a very sensitive probe of the evolution ( or constancy ) of @xmath3 .",
    "measurements of the primary anisotropy would give us ` precise ' values of cosmological parameters ( like @xmath17 ) .",
    "hence , for our calculations , we assume that we know the values of cosmological parameters and do not worry about their effect on the sze power spectrum .",
    "any feature of the sze power spectrum is attributed to specific cluster physics ( like gas content ) .",
    "we note that this method of probing @xmath3 is not biased from any selection effect that can occur while doing pointed sze observations of x - ray selected clusters of galaxies , and hence is more desirable .",
    "current observations of primary cmb anisotropies suggest a flat universe with a cosmological constant ( padmanabhan and sethi , 2000 ) . for our calculations , we take a flat universe with @xmath18 and @xmath19 as our fiducial model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the distribution of clusters and model the cluster parameters . in  3 , we compute the poisson and clustering power spectrum from sze and , finally , we discuss our results and conclude in  4 ..",
    "we set up an ensemble of galaxy clusters with masses between @xmath20 m@xmath21 , using the abundance of collapsed objects as predicted by a modified version of the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function ( press & schechter 1974 ) given by sheth and tormen ( 1999 ) .",
    "the lower mass cutoff signifies the mass for which one expects a well developed icm .",
    "the gas mass is supposed to sit in the halo potential and are distributed in the same manner .",
    "note , the results are not sensitive to either lower or upper cutoff .",
    "we probe up to redshifts of 5 .",
    "most of the power , however , comes from objects distributed at @xmath22 ..    we use the transfer function of bardeen ( 1986 ) , with the shape parameter given by sugiyama ( 1995 ) and the harrison - zeldovich primordial spectrum to calculate the matter power spectrum @xmath23(k ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 normalised ( bunn & white , 1997 ) mass variance ( @xmath25 ) is 0.9 for our fiducial model .",
    "we assume the icm to follow a @xmath26-profile with @xmath27 for simplicity .",
    "the other physical parameters of the clusters are determined using the virial theorem and spherical collapse model .",
    "we closely follow colafrancesco & vittorio ( 1994 ) in our modelling .",
    "we have for the gas density , @xmath28 we take the gas to be extended up to @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the central gas density , @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average proton mass fraction and @xmath34 is the central gas mass density . to account for the fact that there is a final cutoff in the gas distribution we introduce a gaussian filter at the cluster edge @xmath35 given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the fudge factor .",
    "we parametrize the gas mass fraction as f_g = f_g0 ( 1+z)^-s ( m10 ^ 15h^-1m_)^k , where the normalization is taken to be @xmath38 , is based on local rich clusters .",
    "we look at combinations of both mass and redshift dependence for a range of evolutionary models . in particular",
    ", we look at a case of strong evolution given by @xmath39 ( colafrancesco & vittorio , 1994 ) ; @xmath40 ( as suggested by ettori and fabian , 1999 ) ; @xmath41 ( weak evolution ) ; @xmath42 ( no mass dependence ) and @xmath43 ( no redshift dependence ) .    for the core radius @xmath44 and the temperature , we use r_c(_0 , m , z ) & = & 1.69h^-1mpcp 11+z + & & ^1/3 ,    k_b t_e = 7.76 ^-1 ( m10 ^ 15h^-1m_)^2/3 ( 1+z ) kev . here",
    ", @xmath45 is the cluster overdensity relative to the background .    putting everything in",
    ", we have the temperature distortion to be @xmath46 , with    y ( ) = ( ) ( ) . the angular core radius @xmath47 .",
    "the spectral form of the thermal sz effect is given by g(x ) = x^4 e^x , where @xmath48 .",
    "this specific spectral dependence of the thermal sz effect can be used to separate it out from other cmb anisotropies ( cooray , 2000 ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the cmb temperature produced by sze can be quantified by their spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath49 , which can be defined as @xmath50 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of sze is then given by @xmath51 , the brackets denoting an ensemble average .",
    "the power spectrum for the poisson distribution of objects , can then be written as ( cole & kaiser 1988 , peebles 1980 ) c_l^poisson = _ 0^z_max dz dv(z ) _ m_min^m_max dm dn(m , z_in ) |y_l(m , z)|^2 , where @xmath52 is the comoving volume and @xmath53 is the number density of objects .",
    "since these fluctuations occur at very small angular scales , we can use the small angle approximation of legendre transformation and write @xmath54 as the angular fourier transform of @xmath55 as @xmath56)\\theta]\\theta d\\theta $ ] ( peebles 1980 , molnar & birkinshaw 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to poisson power spectra , one would expect contribution to a ` correlation power spectrum ' from the clustering of the galaxy clusters .",
    "following komatsu and kitayama ( 1999 ) , we estimate the clustering angular power spectrum as c_l^clustering & = & _ 0^z_max dz dv(z ) p_m + & & ^2 , where @xmath57 is the time dependent linear bias factor .",
    "the matter power spectrum , @xmath58 , is related to the power spectrum of cluster correlation function @xmath59 through the bias , i.e @xmath60 where we adopt @xmath57 given by @xmath61 ( jing 1999 for details ) .",
    "this expression for the bias factor matches accurately the results of n - body simulations for a wide range in mass . in the above equation @xmath62",
    "is the linear growth factor of density fluctuation , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we study the power spectrum of sze from clusters of galaxies , under the assumption of a ` precise ' and ` a priori ' knowledge of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we also assume that in the @xmath0-range of relevance , thermal sze from clusters of galaxies are the dominant contributors to the temperature anisotropy .",
    "the other secondary anisotropies are either smaller in strength or contribute at even higher @xmath65 or have different spectral dependence ( aghanim , 2000 ; majumdar , 2000 ) .",
    "we have plotted the poisson sze power spectrum in fig1 , left panel . clearly , the primary feature distinguishing a non - evolutionary constant @xmath3 model from an evolutionary one is the position of the peak .",
    "the model with a constant @xmath3 peaks at a higher @xmath0-value and also has greater power .",
    "the constant @xmath3 model peaks at @xmath66 .",
    "this result is in agreement with that of komatsu & kitayama ( 1999 ) .",
    "if one assumes that there is no evolution of @xmath3 with redshift ( i.e s=0 ) , the peak is at @xmath67 , whereas in the case of no dependence on mass ( k=0 ) , the peak is at @xmath68 .",
    "based on emss data ( david , 1990 ) , colafrancesco & vittorio ( 1994 ) ( and also molnar & birkinshaw 2000 ) model @xmath3 with k=0.5 & s=1 . for this case",
    ", we see that the turnover is at a very low @xmath69 . assuming a mild evolution ( k=0.1 , s=0.1 )",
    ", we get the peak at @xmath70 .",
    "we also show results for ( k=0.5 , s=0.5 ) and ( k=0.1 , s=0.5 ) .",
    "the last parametrization is based on the recent analysis of @xmath71 data by ettori & fabian ( 1999 ) .",
    "it is evident that the difference , in the @xmath0-value of the peak of the constant @xmath3 scenario from an evolutionary one , can range between @xmath72 .. the position of the peak thus is a strong distcriminatory signature of any evolution of @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to understand the shift in the peak of the sze power spectrum .",
    "let us consider the case s=0",
    ", i.e. @xmath3 depends only on total mass . from eqn.(1 ) , this means an enhanced reduction of @xmath3 of smaller mass clusters relative to the larger masses and so a reduction of power at larger @xmath65 , ( since smaller masses contribute at larger @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , the peak shifts to a lower @xmath0 . for the case",
    "k=0 , ( i.e only redshift dependence ) , we now have structures at high @xmath73 contributing less to the power ( than without a redshift dependence ) .",
    "since from ps formalism , less massive structures are more abundant at high @xmath73 , this negative dependence of @xmath3 on redshift cuts off their contribution more than the more massive clusters .",
    "hence , once again there is less power at high @xmath0 and the peak shifts to lower @xmath0-value .",
    "the parametrization of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) affects the larger masses less , as evident from almost equal power seen at @xmath74 , for all models .",
    "the net effect is a reduction of power at smaller angular scales , and hence a shift in the position of the peak to a smaller multipole value .",
    "we note that , these results are irrespective of the arguments given ( see rines , 1999 ) to explain any possible evolution of @xmath3 . in their case",
    ", they _ assume _ @xmath3 to be constant and relies on the cosmology to change the angular diameter distance , so that there is an ` apparent ' change in @xmath3 .",
    "in such a case , if there is ` actually ' even a slight evolution of @xmath3 , then one can still account for it with a non - evolutionary model , by simply changing the cosmological parameters .",
    "our method _ does not assume a priori _ any constancy ( or evolution ) of @xmath3 and tries to look for it .",
    "in fig1 , right panel , we show the sze clustering power spectrum . for all models , it falls of at a smaller @xmath0 w.r.t poisson power spectrum .",
    "since for clustering , the peak depends on the average inter - cluster separation , which is fixed once the cosmology is fixed , there is no appreciable spread of the peaks in @xmath0-space .",
    "the only difference is in their relative power w.r.t each other which depends on the total gas mass available to distort the cmb .",
    "addition of the clustering power spectrum to the poisson case results in slight shift of the peaks to lower @xmath0 s .",
    "it maybe possible to measure the power spectrum of sze with the ongoing and future high angular resolution cmb observations . in principle , observations with suzie , ovro , bima and atca can probe the range in @xmath0 from @xmath75 and a frequency range of @xmath76 ghz .",
    "the sze power spectrum would also be measured with increased precision by the proposed alma and amiba ( which is geared for blank sky surveys ) .    finally ,",
    "let us comment on the validity and robustness of our results . in fig2",
    ", we show results for an open universe ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the difference in the peak position of constant @xmath3 and evolutionary models remain far apart ( infact , for same parameters of @xmath39 , the difference increases to @xmath78 from that of @xmath79 in a flat universe ) .",
    "it is seen that the turnover of the sze power spectrum is insensitive to the mass cutoff , since main contribution to the anisotropy comes from clusters with @xmath80 . in fig2",
    ", we also indicate the effect of having a more compact gas distribution with @xmath81 .",
    "we see that shift in the peaks are negligible ( though the height is reduced a little ) and an uncertainty as to how far the gas extends is not major .",
    "the use of a single @xmath26 to model the full gas distribution introduces little error , though a @xmath26-model fits the inner cluster regions better .",
    "this is because the major contribution to the anisotropy comes from around the core region , and increasing @xmath26 slightly decreases the overall distortion , without touching the peak .",
    "also , a modified @xmath82 relation ( more suitable for @xmath7cdm ) does not change the conclusions of this paper ( although amplitude of distortion slightly changes ) . for a more detailed analysis ,",
    "however , one should take better observationally supported gas density and temperature profiles ( see yoshikawa & suto , 1999 ) .",
    "these points will be discussed in greater detail in a future publication .    in conclusion , we have computed the angular power spectrum of sze from clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have shown the position of the peak of the power spectrum to bear a _ strong discriminatory signature _ of different @xmath3 models .",
    "one of the goals of arc minute scale observations of the cmb anisotropy is to measure the sze power spectrum from blank sky surveys .",
    "such observational results can be used to constrain @xmath3 models .",
    "this also has the added advantage of being devoid of uncertainties that can creep in through ` selection biases ' in estimating the @xmath3 using pointed studies of x - ray selected galaxy cluster .",
    "our method , thus , provides a powerful probe of evolution ( or constancy ) of gas mass fraction and can potentially resolve the decade long debate .    the author wishes to thank joe mohr and biman nath for critical comments , sunita nair and dipankar bhattacharya for valuable suggestions and pijush bhattacharjee for encouragements .",
    "he also wishes to thank the raman reseach institute , bangalore . after the completion of this work",
    ", we learnt about a complimentary work by carlstrom & holder ( 2001 ) which looks at changes in gas profiles due to preheating and its effect on sze .",
