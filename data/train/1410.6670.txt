    "<S> carrier multiplication is a many - particle process giving rise to the generation of multiple electron - hole pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this process holds the potential to increase the power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices . in graphene , </S>",
    "<S> carrier multiplication has been theoretically predicted and recently experimentally observed . however , due to the absence of a bandgap and competing phonon - induced electron - hole recombination , the extraction of charge carriers remains a substantial challenge . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a new strategy to benefit from the gained charge carriers by introducing a landau quantization that offers a tunable bandgap . based on microscopic calculations within the framework of the density matrix formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we report a significant carrier multiplication in graphene under landau quantization . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reveal a high tunability of the effect via externally accessible pump fluence , temperature , and the strength of the magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> * introduction . * in 1961 schockley and queisser predicted a fundamental limit of approximately @xmath0 for the power conversion efficiency of single junction solar cells @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their calculation is based on a simple model , in which the excess energy of absorbed photons is assumed to dissipate as heat . </S>",
    "<S> this is a good assumption for most conventional semiconductors , whereas for low - dimensional nanostructures with strong coulomb interaction , the excess energy can be exploited to generate additional electron - hole pairs . in such structures with highly efficient auger processes , the schockley - queisser limit can be exceeded up to @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the gained multiple electron - hole pairs can also increase the sensitivity of photodetectors and other optoelectronic devices .    </S>",
    "<S> carrier multiplication ( cm ) was first theoretically predicted @xcite and measured @xcite for semiconductor quantum dots exhibiting a strong spatial confinement in all three directions . </S>",
    "<S> multiplication of photo - excited carriers has also been found in one - dimensional nanostructures , such as carbon nanotubes @xcite . in graphene , </S>",
    "<S> the carrier confinement combined with the linear bandstructure was predicted to account for highly efficient auger processes @xcite giving rise to a considerable carrier multiplication @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just recently , these predictions were confirmed by brida et al . within a joint experiment - theory study also including new insights into collinear scattering in graphene @xcite , which has been controversially discussed in literature . </S>",
    "<S> however , to realize graphene - based photovoltaic devices , the key problem of charge carrier extraction in gapless nanostructures needs to be solved . </S>",
    "<S> here we suggest a strategy based on landau quantization of graphene to address this substantial challenge , where a magnetic field is used to induce gaps between discrete landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> graphene in high magnetic fields has already attracted an immense interest in recent years @xcite . unlike an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas , it exhibits an unique landau level structure , where the energy is proportional to the square root of the landau level index @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is a direct consequence of the linear density of states in the low - energy region and results in an anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite .     and @xmath4 , cf . the yellow arrows . </S>",
    "<S> the energy - conserving process of impact excitation ( ie ) involves the inter - landau level transition @xmath5 , which provides the energy to excite an electron from @xmath6 to @xmath7 resulting in an increase of the number of charge carriers , cf . the red arrows . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse process of auger recombination ( ar ) is shown by the green arrows . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    in this article , we predict the occurrence of carrier multiplication in landau - quantized graphene , where the energy gap between the landau levels is of advantage for the extraction of gained charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field can be tuned so that the inter - landau level spacings do not fit the energy of the most relevant optical phonons resulting in a strongly suppressed carrier - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> although at first sight the non - equidistant landau level spectrum seems to suppress auger processes , a number of energetically degenerate inter - landau level transitions exists providing the basis for efficient auger scattering , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig [ fig : sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to exploit the advantage of graphene having a strong coulomb interaction while the acoustic phonon coupling is weak in comparison to an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas in a semiconductor heterostructure . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> graphene under landau quantization presents optimal conditions for the appearance of a significant carrier multiplication .    </S>",
    "<S> * theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> * while the carrier dynamics in graphene has been intensively investigated over the last few years @xcite , there has been only a single study in the presence of a strong magnetic field by plochocka et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the latter study </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation dynamics between higher landau levels ( @xmath8 ) is investigated in a differential transmission experiment revealing the importance of auger scattering in a magnetic field and an overall suppression of scattering rates in comparison to the no - field case . </S>",
    "<S> based on the density matrix formalism @xcite , we perform time - resolved microscopic calculations of the ultrafast carrier relaxation dynamics within the energetically lowest landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit a correlation expansion in second order born - markov approximation @xcite to derive bloch equations for graphene under landau quantization :    @xmath9+s_{n}^{\\text{in}}(t)\\left[1-\\rho_{n}(t)\\right]-s_{n}^{\\text{out}}(t)\\rho_{n}(t),\\label{eq : bloch-1}\\\\ \\dot{p}_{nn'}(t ) & = & i\\triangle\\omega_{nn'}p_{nn'}(t)+\\omega_{nn'}(t)\\,\\left[\\rho_{n}(t)-\\rho_{n'}(t)\\right]-\\frac{\\gamma(t)}{\\hbar}p_{nn'}(t).\\label{eq : bloch-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is a coupled system of differential equations for the carrier occupation probability @xmath10 in the landau level @xmath11 and the microscopic polarization @xmath12 being a measure for optical inter - landau level transitions according to optical selection rules , cf . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sketch ] . </S>",
    "<S> the equations explicitly include the carrier - light interaction , all energy conserving electron - electron scattering processes , as well as the coupling with most relevant optical phonons . </S>",
    "<S> the carrier - light interaction enters the equations via the rabi frequency @xmath13 with the elementary charge @xmath14 , the electron mass @xmath15 , the optical matrix element @xmath16 , and the vector potential @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy difference @xmath18 between the involved landau levels defines the resonance condition . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is incorporated into the equations by exploiting the peierls substitution ( see supplementary note 1 ) , accounting for the change of electron momentum induced by the confinement into cyclotron orbits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearing in- and out - scattering rates @xmath19 describe coulomb- and phonon - induced many - particle scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> the rates include pauli - blocking terms and the corresponding matrix elements , cf . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary notes 2 - 4 for more details . due to the energy mismatch of the optical phonon modes with the inter - landau level transitions at the assumed magnetic field strength , optical phonon scattering is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> processes involving acoustic phonons and two - phonon relaxation processes can occur @xcite , however , both are much slower compared to the coulomb - induced dynamics and are neglected in the following . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering processes do not only change the carrier occupation @xmath10 , they also contribute to the dephasing @xmath20 of the microscopic polarization @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution of @xmath20 stems from electron - impurity scattering , which also induces a broadening of the landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> this broadening is explicitly calculated in the self - consistent born approximation following the approach of ando @xcite , cf . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary note 5 , where the electron - impurity scattering strength is chosen in agreement with previous theoretical studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the applied markov approximation has been tested by performing calculations taking also into account non - markovian effects . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reflect the quantum - mechanical energy - time uncertainty principle giving rise to a weak temporal oscillation of carrier occupations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the effect is small and does not qualitatively change the investigated inter - landau level carrier dynamics , cf . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary note 6 .    in order to account for momentum - dependent dynamical screening , </S>",
    "<S> we consider the dielectric function @xmath21 in the random phase approximation following the approach of refs . @xcite . while the real part of the dielectric function closely resembles the static limit ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , taking a finite energy transfer @xmath22 into account gives rise to a non - vanishing imaginary part , cf . </S>",
    "<S> supplementary note 3 for more details . </S>",
    "<S> then , the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath23 appearing in the coulomb matrix element @xmath24 is substituted by the screened potential @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 and @xmath22 are the momentum and energy transfers of the scattering events and @xmath27 denotes the wave function of a state @xmath28 . since in the presence of a magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the momentum is not a well - defined quantity , the vanishing screening in the long - wavelength limit does not imply a divergence of the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the singularities for collinear scattering processes appearing in graphene in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite do not occur in landau - quantized graphene due to the absence of a strictly defined momentum conservation in such a discrete system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , note that excitonic effects of the coulomb interaction can be neglected , since the landau level broadening is generally larger than the coulomb - induced finite excitonic dispersion , cf . </S>",

    "<S> the dashed lines illustrate the dynamics in the absence of coulomb scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the yellow shaded region denotes the width of the excitation pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation @xmath32 is not involved in the relaxation dynamics , @xmath33 remains constant , and @xmath34 shows an increase during pumping just like @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the study is performed for undoped graphene at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    * carrier relaxation dynamics . * using tight - binding wave functions , we analytically determine the electronic bandstructure and the matrix elements appearing in the bloch equations . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have all ingredients at hand to evaluate the equations and obtain a microscopic access to the time - resolved ultrafast relaxation dynamics of optically excited carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the initial occupation probabilities @xmath36 before the optical excitation are given by the fermi function at room temperature . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : sketch ] . as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occupations_0.1pump ] , the carrier occupation probability @xmath40 increases up to @xmath41 during the optical excitation ( blue shaded area ) , while @xmath42 decreases for the same amount ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the build up of occupation in the landau level @xmath43 is stopped during the optical excitation and @xmath44 starts to slightly decrease , cf . </S>",
    "<S> the orange solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occupations_0.1pump ] . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be unambiguously traced back to the coulomb - induced relaxation process , cf . the orange dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occupations_0.1pump ] illustrating the temporal evolution of @xmath44 without coulomb scattering . at the same time , the occupation in landau level @xmath7 that is not driven at all by the optical pulse , increases until saturation is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the occupation @xmath45 remains constant , if the coulomb interaction is switched off , cf . </S>",
    "<S> the blue dashed line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occupations_0.1pump ] . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be understood as following : first , the exciting laser pulse generates a non - equilibrium carrier distribution by transferring electrons from @xmath46 to @xmath43 ( yellow arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sketch ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , auger - type processes including impact excitation ( ie ) and auger recombination ( ar ) redistribute the carriers between the equidistant landau levels @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( red and green arrows in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sketch ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations clearly reveal that ie is the predominant channel at the beginning of the relaxation dynamics due to the pauli blocking terms in the scattering rates @xmath19 in the bloch equations . during the optical excitation , </S>",
    "<S> the occupation of @xmath43 is enhanced , whereas @xmath7 contains only few electrons corresponding to the thermal distribution at room temperature . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the electron - electron interaction favors the transition @xmath5 over the inverse process and provides the energy to excite an additional electron into @xmath7 from the energetically equidistant zeroth landau level . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the observed increase of @xmath45 and the decrease of @xmath40 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : occupations_0.1pump ] . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the occupation @xmath49 does not change and remains @xmath50 during the entire relaxation dynamics ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the peculiarity of the zeroth landau level being half valence half conduction band @xcite . due to the symmetry between electrons and holes in the considered undoped graphene , </S>",
    "<S> each transition evolving electrons can also occur with holes with exactly the same probability . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the electron transition @xmath51 is always accompanied by a hole transition @xmath52 corresponding to the excitation of an electron into the zero landau level . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an unconventional ie , where effectively only one charge carrier is created in every scattering event . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a constant @xmath49 , while @xmath40 decreases and @xmath45 increases , just as our theory predicts .     </S>",
    "<S> including the thermal equilibrium distribution @xmath53 , and the optically excited carrier density @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the auger - induced carrier dynamics results in a carrier multiplication of @xmath55 at the considered pump fluence of @xmath56{\\mu jcm^{-2}}$].,width=321 ]    * carrier multiplication . * to examine the total impact of auger scattering processes </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the temporal evolution of the carrier density that is composed of electrons in the conduction and holes in the valence band landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - hole symmetry allows a convenient definition of the carrier density @xmath57 with the factor 2 accounting for the electron - hole symmetry , the total degeneracy of each landau level @xmath58 and the area @xmath59 . under the investigated conditions , the zeroth landau level , being equally divided between both bands , </S>",
    "<S> has a temporally constant occupation and does not contribute . </S>",
    "<S> due to the finite temperature , the initial value of the carrier density is non - zero and we start with an equilibrium value @xmath53 ( yellow line in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : carrier density_0.1pump ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical pulse excites carriers and therewith leads to an ascent of the carrier density on a picosecond time scale . </S>",
    "<S> if no many- particle interactions are taken into account , @xmath54 reaches a value of approximately @xmath60{cm^{-2}}$ ] , cf . the orange line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : carrier density_0.1pump ] </S>",
    "<S> . the full dynamics including coulomb - induced carrier scattering reveals a further increase of the carrier density up to @xmath61{cm^{-2}}$ ] reflecting the appearance of a significant carrier multiplication . </S>",
    "<S> the cm factor is defined by @xmath62 and corresponds to @xmath63 at the given characteristics of the excitation pulse . </S>",
    "<S> it is a direct consequence of the impact excitation , where more carriers are generated in @xmath7 than are lost in @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this is apparent when comparing the drop - off in @xmath40 ( @xmath64 ) with the increase of @xmath45 ( @xmath65 ) after two picoseconds in fig . </S>",

    "<S> our calculations show a much more efficient ie as a consequence of the non - equilibrium distribution created by the optical excitation , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : auger rates_0.1pump ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ongoing impact excitation during and after the excitation leads to a more efficient auger recombination until both rates are equal after roughly @xmath67{ps}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is the time frame , in which cm takes place , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : carrier density_0.1pump ] . </S>",
    "<S> its value corresponds to the area between both curves , which is ultimately defined by the asymmetry between the two competing processes . </S>",
    "<S> their efficiency as coulomb channels strongly depends on the pump fluence determining the number of available scattering partners . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the electronic temperature and the strength of the magnetic field have an influence on the predicted asymmetry between ie and ar </S>",
    "<S> .    * discussion . * addressing the optimization of cm , we investigate its dependence on the externally controllable parameters , such as pump fluence , temperature , and magnetic field , cf . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the initial asymmetry between impact excitation and auger recombination is larger at enhanced pump fluences , it also leads to a faster equilibration of both rates leaving a shorter time frame for cm to occur @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the carrier multiplication decreases with the pump fluence until a saturation of pumping at higher fluences is reached , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]a . </S>",
    "<S> then , cm starts to slightly increase again reflecting the inefficient optical pumping at saturation conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on temperature is governed by occupation effects . a higher temperature results in less efficient impact excitation , since an increased initial occupation of @xmath7 lowers the efficiency of the electronic transition @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative temperature trend resembles a fermi distribution ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]b ) resulting in the largest cm for temperatures lower than @xmath68 . finally , the dependence on the magnetic field is more complex as it is a combination of both effects discussed above , namely the excitation strength and occupation effects . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the magnetic field , the landau levels ( except for @xmath6 ) shift to higher energies according to the relation @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the initial thermal occupation probability @xmath70 for @xmath71 is reduced with increasing magnetic field and ie becomes more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the effective excitation strength is determined by the amplitude of the laser pulse and is inverse proportional to its frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> -[fig : auger rates_0.1pump].,width=321 ]    as the latter increases with the magnetic field , the pumping becomes less efficient giving rise to a more pronounced cm , as already shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]a . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a saturation value for the carrier multiplication of @xmath72 , cf . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]c . </S>",
    "<S> this value is characteristic for the investigated undoped graphene within the energetically lowest landau levels . here </S>",
    "<S> , ie can only occur once via scattering involving the energetically equidistant landau levels @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the peculiar nature of the zeroth landau level being a conduction and valence band at the same time allows only the generation of one additional charge carrier per excitation , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an optically excited electron - hole pair can yield in total up to three charge carriers resulting in a maximal cm of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> note that at higher magnetic fields , certain inter - landau level transitions can become resonant with optical phonon modes creating so called magneto - phonon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected to reduce the observed cm , since the phonons open up a new relaxation channel directly competing with auger processes , and even the electron - phonon interaction is modified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the high - magnetic field region of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]c should be understood as a trend of the cm as a function of the magnetic field . at very low magnetic fields , the spacing between landau levels decreases , resulting in an overlapping of levels . here , the applied theoretical approach is not valid anymore . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , note that the carrier multiplication does not significantly depend on the landau level broadening , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cm(fluence , b , t)]d . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the lorentzian appearing in the scattering rates decreases for larger broadenings . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric function is reduced leading to an enhancement of the coulomb interaction . additionally , due to an increased dephasing of @xmath73 , </S>",
    "<S> the optical pumping is less efficient . </S>",
    "<S> overall these effects nearly cancel out resulting in a cm that is to a large extent independent of landau level broadening .    including energetically higher landau levels </S>",
    "<S> will increase the cm , since the excess energy of a highly excited electron - hole pair can provide enough energy for more than one ie scattering event . in this very first study , </S>",
    "<S> we have provided clear evidence of cm in the low energy limit . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the findings of plochocka et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that experimentally prove the importance of auger scattering even for higher landau levels , we expect a pronounced cm to occur in a broad spectral range . although they suspect that auger scattering may be suppressed for lower landau levels , their findings are indeed compatible with our results . </S>",
    "<S> a multi - color pump - probe experiment addressing the carrier dynamics between the discrete low - energy landau levels should confirm our theoretical predictions in a straightforward way .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have gained new fundamental insights into the relaxation dynamics in graphene under landau quantization , in particular revealing the appearance of a considerable carrier multiplication that can be traced back to an efficient impact excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that landau quantization offers a promising strategy to address the key challenge of carrier extraction in a gapless structure which might be beneficial for the design of graphene - based optoelectronic devices .    </S>"
