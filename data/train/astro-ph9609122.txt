    "the detection of weak gravitational lensing effects ( weak shear and magnification bias ) at large distance from cluster centers is now well established ( see fort & mellier 1994 and narayan & bartelmann 1996 for reviews ) . with the present development of wide field ccd detectors mounted on the best telescopes it becomes possible to start the investigation of large scale structures from lensing effect observations in an angular area of significant size .",
    "the shear and the magnification are expected to be imposed on the background galaxies by the density fluctuations along the line - of - sight . compared to usual determinations of the density fluctuations in the local universe with galaxy counts ( in fact , the light distribution ) ,",
    "this approach is extremely attractive since it is directly sensitive to the global mass fluctuations regardless of any biases associated with the light distribution .",
    "the detection of weak lensing has thus naturally been suggested as a possible means to measure the power spectrum of the large scale density fluctuations ( blandford et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "theoretical studies done by blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , miralda - escud ( 1991a ) , kaiser ( 1992 ) and more recently by villumsen ( 1996 ) proposed various approaches and discussed the feasibility of observational strategies for some specific cosmological scenarios .",
    "in all cases , they concluded that weak lensing induced by large scale structures is detectable with the present techniques .",
    "they claimed that the projected power spectrum should be recovered provided some crucial observational issues , namely the correction of image degradation , are solved .",
    "however , even if the observational aspects are certainly the main difficulties in the future , different theoretical problems have not been addressed yet . in particular , the dependence of the physical quantities ( such as the convergence , see hereafter ) on the cosmological parameters have not been discussed in complete detail .",
    "moreover the errors associated with those quantities for realistic scenarios of large scale structure formation .",
    "this paper thus is a theoretical study in which we explore the dependence of a priori physical quantities on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we will focus our analysis on the second and third moment of the local filtered convergence at large angular scale , i.e. in a regime where perturbation theory results are expected to be valid .",
    "we take here advantage of many results that have been obtained in the last few years in this regime , showing that the perturbation theory calculations give extremely accurate results for the behavior of the high order moments of the cosmic density at large scale ( many papers should be quoted , see juszkiewicz & bouchet 1995 or bernardeau 1996b for short review papers on the subject ) .",
    "our aim is to present quantitative predictions on the behavior of the moments of the one - point probability distribution function of the local convergence as a function of the matter power spectrum , the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as long as one is interested in its second moment in the linear regime , results can easily be extrapolated to other quantities such as the magnification or the distortion ( see section 3 for more details on these quantities and their relationships ) . for the third moment",
    "however , the choice of the local convergence ( or any other scalar quantity ) is crucial .",
    "the distortion is intrinsically irrelevant since its third moment , for obvious symmetry reasons , should vanish .",
    "the first non - trivial moment would then be its kurtosis , the connected part of the fourth moment , but this is then more intricate to calculate , and also would be more difficult to measure .",
    "other scalar quantities could have been considered , such as the local magnification , but it is not ( at the second order ) directly proportional to the local density , as it is the case for the convergence .",
    "this is why we have preferred this latter quantity .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations , valid for any cosmological model , from which we derive the quantities of interest . in  3 we explore the dependence of the variance of the convergence on the cosmological parameters . in ",
    "4 we consider third order moments . in the last section we present a study of the expected errors due to the use of a finite sample that are expected to affect the measurements of the second and third moment .",
    "the errors have been quantified for a realistic scenario ( apm like power spectrum in an einstein - de sitter universe ) .",
    "we eventually propose , in view of the previous results , an adapted strategy to do such observations . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath6 , the physical distances have thus to be multiplied by @xmath7 for @xmath8/mpc to be expressed in mpc .",
    "the gravitational lensing effects makes intervene both the redshift distributions of the lenses and the sources . in the last section",
    "we discuss in more detail the knowledge we have or need to have on the sources , but at this stage we simply describe the redshift distribution of these objects by @xmath9 with the normalization , @xmath10 to illustrate the results we will either assume that the sources are all at the same redshift or are given by a broad distribution . in the latter case we adopt a reasonnable analytic model which reproduces the redshift distributions observed in the faint redshift surveys and those expected from models of galaxy evolution ( charlot & fall in preparation ) , @xmath11\\ { \\d z\\over z_s}\\ , , \\label{nz}\\ ] ] in which it is assumed that the average redshift of the sources is @xmath5 and that the width of the distribution is about @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "1 , thin lines in the upper panel ) .",
    "we are interested in the lensing effects induced by the large - scale density fluctuations that are assumed to have emerged from gaussian initial conditions . in the linear regime",
    "we thus assume that the local density can be written should be understood as a covariant product , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively the angular distance and the distance along the line - of - sight (  3.3 ) .",
    "] , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the time dependence of the linear growing mode .",
    "note that the function @xmath17 depends on the cosmological parameters as well .",
    "it is proportional to the expansion factor only for an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the fourier transforms of the initial local density contrast , @xmath18 , are assumed to form a set of gaussian variables .",
    "in such a case the power spectrum @xmath4 entirely determines the statistical properties of the initial density field .",
    "it is defined by @xmath19 from the observed density fluctuation in the apm galaxy survey it is possible to construct a realistic power spectrum @xmath4 for both its magnitude and its shape . using the results of baugh & gaztaaga ( 1996 ) we can use the shape ( we have set @xmath20 ) , @xmath21^{3/2}},\\label{pk}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 that reproduces the observed density fluctuations in the _ linear _ regime , when @xmath23 . but this should not be a problem since we focus our calculations on the linear or quasilinear regime .",
    "the large @xmath24 behaviour of @xmath4 is therefore not relevant for the purpose of this work . ] .",
    "baugh & gaztaaga compared the observed fluctuations in the apm galaxy survey with the prediction of this power spectrum and found a good agreement in the linear regime .",
    "results of numerical simulations also show that the nonlinear evolution of the density fluctuations induced with such a spectrum are in good agreement with the observed full shape of the angular two - point correlation function .    in this paper , and",
    "contrary to previous studies , we do not make any assumption on both the density of the universe @xmath0 and on the cosmological constant , @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to present the mathematical objects that describe the local gravitational deformation .",
    "in particular we recall the relationships between the local convergence @xmath25 , the statistical properties of which we will investigate , and the quantities that are more directly observable . we consider two neighboring geodesics @xmath26 and @xmath27 which are enclosed by a light bundle , and we call @xmath28 the two dimensional position angle between @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the observer position .",
    "let us define @xmath29 as the angular diameter distance between @xmath26 and @xmath27 at a given redshift @xmath30 .",

    "the angular distance @xmath29 corresponds to an angular position on the sky @xmath37 such that , @xmath38 the shapes of the light bundles on the image plane are described by the amplification matrix @xmath39 , the jacobian of the transformation from a virtual screen located at @xmath30 ( the source plane ) , to the image plane as seen by the observer .",

    "6 the results obtained for the function @xmath162 for the power spectrum ( [ pk ] ) , the source distribution ( [ nz ] ) with @xmath133 ( solid line ) and @xmath5=2 ( dashed line ) in case of an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "we can see that the function @xmath163 is rather flat , with little variation with the smoothing angle .      from equation ( [ s3z ] )",
    "we easily can visualize the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath163 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the result is almost independent of the index @xmath164 , and we have approximately , @xmath165 as for the variance , we found that the dependence of the skewness on the redshift of the sources is also quite large .",
    "from the general formulation we can also explore the dependence of the results on the cosmological parameters . in fig .",
    "8 we present the @xmath0 dependence of the result for @xmath138 .",
    "we can see that the dependence is rather large , approximatively as @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence is actually slightly weaker when the sources are at higher redshift ( when the sources are at very small @xmath30 we recover the natural expectation that @xmath163 varies inversely with @xmath0 . )    in fig .",
    "9 we then present the contour plot showing the dependence of the parameter on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we can see that @xmath163 is significantly less @xmath1 dependent .",
    "a this stage it is worth to compare the qualitative results obtained here with those obtained for an a priori similar case : the statistics in an angular survey . in both cases indeed the observed quantities are proportional to the cosmic density integrated along the line - of - sight .",
    "the expected properties of the moments of the one - point pdf are however qualitatively different .",
    "the reason is that for a 2d angular survey , the density fluctuations are calculated with a selection function implicitly normalized to unity , whereas the efficiency function in the case of the weak lensing is not normalized ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as a consequence",
    "the local convergence is the _ summation _ of the effects of each lens plane , whereas the local measured galaxy over - density identifies with the _ average _ of all contributions present on the line - of - sight .",
    "the behavior of these quantities is thus dramatically different when the depth of the respective catalogues is changed .",
    "the variance of the local convergence increases with the depth ( as for a random walk , the mean distance from the center increases as the square root of the number of steps ) , but it becomes more and more gaussian , so that @xmath163 decreases . on the other hand the variance of the local galaxy density contrast decreases with the depth , since the density fluctuations tend to be smoothed out .",
    "the parameter @xmath163 is on the other hand almost independent of this depth .",
    "this is exactly what one would obtain by considering respectively the summation or the average of a given number of quasi - gaussian variables .",
    "from these general remarks one can build a very simple model for the moments of the local convergence that reproduces qualitatively the results discussed in the previous sections .",
    "let us define @xmath168 as the average of the efficiency function when the sources are at redshift @xmath5 , @xmath169 then , from eqs .",
    "( 48 ) and ( 67 ) we simply expect that , @xmath170 which show the dependence of these statistical quantities on the efficiency function and the depth of the catalogue .",
    "these relations are certainly crude approximations , but explain most of the features encountered previously , such as the dependence of the results on @xmath171 and on the redshift of the sources .",
    "it also suggests the existence of a combination of @xmath172 and @xmath163 that would be almost independent of the redshift of the sources . this combination ( which is almost the product of these two quantities , since @xmath168 is proportional to the distance ) would contain information of purely cosmological nature .      as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ skew ] ) the skewness is induced by any quadratic coupling in the observed convergence . in particular",
    "it implies that the convergence should not be measured from the local shear using the linear approximation . the method proposed by kaiser ( 1995 ) , or a similar method , that takes into account the nonlinear relation between the local shear and the local convergence has to be used .",
    "spurious couplings can appear also through :    * nonlinear coupling between two deflecting lenses ; * coupling between two deflecting lenses due to the induced displacement of the light path ; * coupling between the population of selected sources and the local convergence ; * density fluctuations of sources .",
    "in the following we subsequently examine the importance of these different effects .",
    "this coupling is due to the fact that when the light path intercepts two lenses the resulting effect is given by the product of the amplification matrices . the resulting convergence @xmath173 is given by the trace of this product , but coincides with the sum of the convergences induced by each lens separately only in the linear regime .",
    "in general it is indeed given by @xmath174 which contain quadratic terms in the local lens densities ( the indices @xmath175 and @xmath176 correspond to quantities associated with the lenses @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively ) .",
    "actually this nonlinear coupling between two lenses appears in the neglected term in ( [ kap2 ] ) .",
    "this term induces a corrective expression for the second order convergence term , @xmath177    the other source of coupling is due to the failure of the born approximation ( i.e. the densities are calculated along the unperturbed light path ) when two lenses are involved . indeed the convergence induced by a given lens is not due to the local projected density at the observed angular position if a foreground lens shifts the apparent position of the background galaxies .",
    "it implies that in ( [ kappa1 ] ) the local over - density can be taken at the unperturbed position only at the linear order but in general should be taken at the position @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the displacement induced by the foreground lenses . to get the quadratic coupling one can simply write ,",
    "@xmath180 this term induces a term similar to ( [ kapc1 ] ) , @xmath181    these two terms obviously induce a corrective term for the skewness .",
    "it can be easily calculated , and we estimate it here for an einstein - de sitter universe for sources at a fixed redshift @xmath5 .",
    "in such a case the second order corrective term for the convergence reads , @xmath182.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the resulting corrective term for @xmath163 is @xmath183 so that ) , see bernardeau ( 1995 ) . ]",

    "it is completely negligible compared to the main contribution ( [ s3z ] ) , and note that this effect is expected , at first glance , to be mainly independent of @xmath0",
    ".    it might be also worth to note that the resulting deformation field induced by two lenses is no more potential ( the amplification matrix is not symmetric ) . as a result ,",
    "the method proposed by kaiser ( 1995 ) to build the local convergence from the local shear is expected to fail at this level .",
    "once again , this is not expected to be crucial since the effects of this coupling are seen to be small .",
    "the origin of this effect is the fact that the population of sources on which the shear is measured may change with the local magnification . in this case",
    "@xmath185 with @xmath186}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 is the partial derivative of the number density of sources at a given redshift with the local convergence ( therefore the local magnification ) for a fixed normalization .",
    "it can be evaluated a priori from the population of objects used to do the measurements , and on the selection procedure .",
    "for instance the mean depth of the sources is expected to change with the local magnification .",
    "we can build a simple model in which we assume that the sources are always at a given redshift , but that its corresponding angular distance is a function of the local magnification , @xmath188 it would imply , for an einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath189 in such a case the corrective term for @xmath163 can be calculated straightforwardly and is given by , @xmath190 it is not necessarily completely negligible , depending on the value of @xmath191 , that is the sensitivity of the selected population of sources with the local magnification ( this will be explored in more details in the second paper ) .",
    "so , one way to reduce the effect of this coupling is to select the galaxies used to measure the shear from a surface brightness criterion ( bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) . in practice",
    "however , it is probably impossible to suppress all influence in the selection procedure of the total luminosity of the objects .      throughout this study",
    "we have always implicitly assumed that the sources formed a uniform background population .",
    "this is actually far from being true , and one naturally expects the sources to have cosmic density fluctuations .",
    "the effects of these fluctuations of the measurements of the local convergences strongly depend on the adopted method . for a method based on the estimation of the local magnification by the depletion of the galaxy number density ( magnification bias ) , this can be a very strong effect on both moments . for methods in which the local convergence is built from the measured shear",
    ", this effect is weak .",
    "simple considerations show that it introduces a significant coupling only at the level of the fourth moment .",
    "this is due to the fact that the populations of sources and lenses can be considered as two independent populations so there are no direct couplings between their density fluctuations .",
    "in this section we investigate the effects of the cosmic variance on the precision of the measurements of the second moment and on @xmath163 .",
    "the origin of this error is the finite size of the sample in which the measurement could be done .",
    "typically we will assume that the sample size is about @xmath192 , which could be accessible in the coming years for the now available technologies .",
    "in this section we describe the measured local convergence , @xmath193 as the sum of the exact local convergence and a noise @xmath194 , @xmath195 the random noise @xmath196 components are assumed to be all independent of each other , independent of the true values of the local convergence and to have the same variance @xmath197 , @xmath198 it is reasonable to assume that @xmath197 is of the order of @xmath199 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we then introduce the notation @xmath200 which is the ( connected ) geometrical average of the quantity @xmath201 in the sample .",
    "these quantities are also cosmic random variables and are thus expected to vary from one sample to another . our goal is then to estimate the ensemble averages and variances of those geometrical averages for the quantities of interest , i.e. to know how good they are as estimates of the true cosmic quantities .",
    "to do such calculations we have to introduce the expression of joint moments of the local convergence .",
    "luckily , this is not too complicated !",
    "indeed in the quasi - linear regime one can show that , when the separation between two cells is large compared to the smoothing angle , we have @xmath202 where @xmath203 are finite quantities .",
    "this is the application to 2d statistics of what was developed in 3d by bernardeau ( 1996a ) .",
    "however contrary to the 3d case , and due to projection effects , these coefficients depend on the details of the adopted model .",
    "they can anyway be calculated numerically ( see appendix a ) . using these results we can calculate both the expectation value of a measured quantity and the variance of this measure .",
    "thus we have @xmath204 the numerical calculations give the values of the required coefficients @xmath203 ( appendix a ) , from which we have @xmath205 the cosmic errors of course decrease with the size of the sample .",
    "what the previous results show is that the errors are already quite small when the size of the sample is @xmath192 and would allow , for a perfectly well known source distribution , a determination of the cosmological parameters at the 10 to 15% level .",
    "using perturbation theory techniques , we have calculated the variance and the skewness of the local filtered convergence @xmath25 in an inhomogeneous cosmology in the frw framework .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 can be calculated from the measurement of the magnification @xmath49 and/or the distortion @xmath50 .",
    "the exploration of the dependence of the variance of @xmath25 on the parameters of interest have shown that it is , as expected , strongly dependent on @xmath0 , but also on @xmath1 .",
    "it is of course proportional to the magnitude of the power spectrum of the matter fluctuations .",
    "these dependences , although degenerate with each other , are of immediate cosmological interest .",
    "note that these dependences are given for a given power spectrum normalization at redshift zero . as pointed out in other studies ( kaiser 1996 , jain & seljak in preparation )",
    "if the power spectrum is normalized to the present number density of clusters the degeneracy with @xmath171 almost vanishes .",
    "more worrying is the fact that the variance is also strongly dependent on the redshift of the sources @xmath5 , making difficult to analyze quantitative results in a cosmological context if the sources are not well known .",
    "it is possible to disentangle the dependence of the variance on the magnitude of the power spectrum and the cosmological parameters by the use of two different populations of sources .",
    "thus , the ratio of the variances for these two populations could provide constraints on the cosmological parameters independently of the power spectrum ( the dependence on its shape is only weak ) .",
    "of course the problem mentioned previously for the knowledge of the population of sources is even more critical since both populations have to be perfectly known .",
    "more interestingly , the skewness @xmath163 of the local convergence , expressed as the ratio of the third moment and the square of the second , can also provide a way to separate the dependence on the cosmological parameters .",
    "we indeed found that this quantity does not depend on the amplitude of the power spectrum , is weakly dependent on its shape and varies almost as the inverse of the density parameter , with a slight degeneracy with the cosmological constant .",
    "moreover the skewness is a probe of the initial gaussian nature of the density field .",
    "if physical mechanisms such as cosmic strings , topological defects , symmetry breaking , etc ... generate non gaussian features in the initial density field , they will modify the behavior of @xmath163 ( see gaztaaga & mhnen 1996 ) , inducing a strong angular variation of @xmath163 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath163 on the redshift of the sources is surprisingly large , stressing the absolute necessity of knowing the population of sources used to do such measurements .",
    "it is however interesting to note that the product of the variance and the skewness is almost independent of the redshift of sources , so in any case we have a robust estimator of the product @xmath206 .",
    "it might reveal to be an interesting quantity to consider .",
    "an important concern was the contribution of multiple lenses configurations in reducing the significance of these statistical estimators .",
    "we have shown that the two main quadratic couplings between two lenses are ineffective , with contributions of a few percent , and do not strongly depend on the cosmology .",
    "thus , whatever the cosmological model , the cosmological signal contained in the variance and the skewness could be slightly weakened , but is not washed out by these additional couplings .",
    "we have not considered higher order moments , basically because we think that they are not going to improve the situation , i.e. to raise the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters we have with the second and third moments . a rough calculation ( taking into account only the dominant contribution )",
    "shows interestingly that the @xmath207 to @xmath208 ratio is expected to be close to 2 for any cosmological model ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the shape of the power spectrum ) . in principle",
    "it could be used as a test for the gravitational instability scenario with gaussian initial conditions .",
    "we are however far from a reliable measurement of all these quantities .",
    "a concern that has not been addressed in this paper is the validity domain of these results with respect to the nonlinear corrections due to the dynamical evolution of the cosmic fields .",
    "these corrections are expected to intervene at small angular scale where the physical scale of the lenses is expected to enter the nonlinear regime .",
    "the question is naturally , at which angular scale ?",
    "the answer is not straightforward , and actually the situation is slightly different for the second moment and for the skewness . indeed",
    "the second moment is always a measure of the projected power spectrum whether or not it is in the linear regime .",
    "this point was clearly made in a recent work ( jain and seljak , in preparation ) where the rms polarization is calculated including the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum using prescriptions as the ones developed by hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , jain , mo & white ( 1995 ) and peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) . for @xmath163",
    "there are no such transformations that would take into account the nonlinear effects .",
    "but one should have in mind that this parameter has been observed to be very robust against nonlinear corrections ( this is not necessarily the case for the product of the variance and @xmath163 ) .",
    "it has been amply checked in numerical simulations for the 3d filtered density field ( see the remarkable results of baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou , 1995 ) . the situation for the projected density field",
    "has not been investigated in as many details , and extended numerical work would be necessary for that respect .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to extend the work of colombi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who propose a prescription to correct the high order moments of the local 3d filtered density pdf , to the projected density .",
    "another arduous line of investigation would be to take into account in the analytic calculations the so called `` loop corrections '' as it has been pioneered by scoccimarro & frieman ( 1996 ) for the un - smoothed density field .",
    "such calculations could quantify the errors introduced by the nonlinear effects at small angular scale .    in the last section",
    "we have briefly explored the observational requirements for completing a large observational program .",
    "we have in particular tried to estimate the cosmic noise that would affect a catalogue covering an area of 25@xmath209 .",
    "this calculation is at most indicative and should not be considered too realistic .",
    "for instance , in this analysis we have made a fairly crude hypothesis for the noise .",
    "in particular we have assumed that the noise due to the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies is local .",
    "if this is true for the local distortion measurement , this is not true for the convergence if it has been obtained from the reconstruction scheme proposed by kaiser since it involves the gradient of @xmath25 . in this analysis",
    "we have also not taken into account the fluctuations in the number density of sources , that could be significant at the angular scale we are interested in .    on the other hand",
    "we have assumed that the moments were calculated directly , i.e. with the average of the proper power of the different measured convergences .",
    "this may not be the most robust way to do it . indeed , taking advantage of the fact that we expect the probability distribution function of the local convergence to be close to a gaussian distribution it is possible to estimate the variance and the skewness simply from the shape of the pdf around its maximum .",
    "more precisely one can use the edgeworth expansion ( see juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 and bernardeau & kofman 1995 ) to look for the best fitting values of the low order moments without having to actually compute them .",
    "with such a method the results should be less sensitive to the cosmic noise , because less sensitive to the rare events in the tails .",
    "we leave for a coming paper the difficult task of defining what we think could be an optimal strategy for observing the shear induced by the large - scale structures and obtaining constraints of cosmological interest out of it .",
    "but we stress in any case that such a project demands a lensing survey at 25 square degrees scale with a very high image quality .",
    "such a lensing survey will be used for the statistical work described in this paper , but also to probe the angular power spectrum at scales from the mpc to few hundred mpcs .",
    "this program is accessible with the uh8k camera or with the future 16k@xmath21016k ( megacam ) camera at the canada - france - hawaii telescope , provided optimal algorithms for measuring very weak shear are used .",
    "the pixel to pixel autocorrelation function ( acf ) proposed by van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which consists in analyzing the ellipticity of the acf induced by the gravitational shear seems a promising approach because it does not require any more to define object centroids and to compute shape parameters for each individual faint galaxy from noisy images .",
    "the shape of the sample also impacts on the signal to noise : reconstruction method _  la kaiser _ is expected to introduce finite size errors along the edges of the catalogue , so it would be interesting to have a catalogue as compact as possible .",
    "on the other hand an elongated catalogue has less cosmic variance .",
    "the drawback of this project is that it requires the knowledge of the redshift distribution of the sources , especially for faint objects ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "a spectroscopic survey to get the redshift of these objects is unrealistic with present - day ground based telescopes ; fortunately many other methods are possible , such as the photometric redshifts , the lensing inversion technique , and the depletion method ( see mellier 1996 for a review ) .",
    "none of them have proved their ability to get secure redshifts , but they are potentially very attractive because they are not time consuming .",
    "f. b. is grateful to iap where most of this work has been conducted and to the observatoire midi - pyrnes where it has been completed .",
    "the authors are also thankful to the observatoire de strasbourg for its very warm hospitality .",

    "similar results were obtained in a slight different context ( bernardeau 1996a ) for which the derivation of joint cumulants is given for 3d top - hat smoothed density contrasts .",
    "it is shown that when the distance between the smoothing cells is large compared to the smoothing scale , the joint cumulants can be written , @xmath213 at the leading order in perturbation theory , and where the @xmath214 coefficients are finite numbers ( they are constant for a power law spectrum ) .",
    "a crucial property for these coefficients is that we have , @xmath215 so that the derivation of these coefficients reduces to the calculations of a single index series of numbers .",
    "they have been given in the paper mentioned above for the 3d top - hat smoothing .",
    "these results can not be used directly to estimate the joint moments we are interested in , but form however the basis of the calculations .",
    "indeed if we assume , as mentioned in the introduction of this appendix , that the high order expressions of the local convergence are dominated by the projection of the local density of the lenses at the same order , then the expressions of the joint moments are given by the integration over the line - of - sight of the relation ( [ jcul ] ) where the coefficients @xmath216 correspond to the top - hat smoothed joint cumulants _ for the 2d dynamics_. this is a situation which is similar to the situation encountered in the derivation of the expression of the high order moments in angular survey .    using the calculation developed in bernardeau ( 1996a ) and applying it to the 2d dynamics we get , for a power law spectrum of index @xmath164 , @xmath217 and @xmath218    then ,",
    "as a consequence , the local joint cumulants follow a similar hierarchy @xmath219 where the coefficients @xmath220 are given by ratios of integrals along the line - of - sight .",
    "we give here the expressions of these integrals for an einstein - de sitter universe , and we will limit the explicit numerical calculations of these expressions for this case , @xmath221 with @xmath222 where @xmath223.\\ ] ] @xmath224 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath225 is the angle between the two directions of the smoothing cells 1 and 2 .    the final step is to take the geometrical averages of these joint moments in the sample .",
    "it is expected to be dominated by cells being at the distance of the order of the size of the sample , @xmath226 .",
    "then the averaged moments follow the same hierarchy as in ( [ convhie ] ) but for which the function @xmath227 is replaced by @xmath228.\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is introduced in ( [ w2d ] ) .",
    "this result is valid if the sample has a spherical shape , although it is by no means a crucial hypothesis .    in the latter case",
    "the integral @xmath229 is actually the expression of the variance of the convergence in the whole sample .",
    "all the considered joint cumulants are also found to be proportional to this variance , and thus the cosmic uncertainties on the results will be all the more important that this integral is large .",
    "the results will therefore depend very strongly on the adopted shape of the power spectrum . in the following subsection we give the numerical results for the apm measured power spectrum ( [ pk ] ) .",
    "compared to a cdm spectrum it contains more power at large scale and is thus less favorable for the estimation of the cosmic errors , but it is probably more realistic .      in the following",
    "we give the results of the previous integrals for the power spectrum given in ( [ pk ] ) .",
    "the index at the 30 smoothing scale is found to be @xmath230 and then the coefficients of interest are found to be @xmath231 for a sample size of 25 @xmath232 , corresponding to a sample size of @xmath233 .",
    "these results are calculated with the distribution of lenses ( [ nz ] ) in which @xmath234 .",
    "in this appendix we present the derivation of the errors , due to the cosmic variance , i.e. the fact that measurements made in a finite sample are affected by systematic and random errors .",
    "we will naturally focus our presentation on the second and third moments of the local smoothed convergence .    to present the calculations it is necessary to introduce two different averages .",
    "one is the geometrical average , the mean value of a given observed quantity at different locations , and the second is the ensemble average , which corresponds to the expectation value of quantities that depend on cosmic variables ( local densities .. ) or random quantities associated with intrinsic properties of the galaxies such as their _ intrinsic _ ellipticities . in principle",
    "the two averages of a same quantity coincide in a perfect case , that is if the available data set was infinite , but in practice this is obviously not the case ! actually , the geometrical averages , considered as estimations of the corresponding ensemble averages , are also random variables that are expected to vary from one sample to another . in the following",
    "we estimate the properties of these geometrical averages , that is their cosmic expectation values and their variances , assuming that for a sufficiently large sample they obey a gaussian statistics .",
    "we follow here ideas that were developed by colombi , bouchet & schaeffer ( 1995 ) and more precisely by szapudi & colombi ( 1996 ) .      in the following",
    "we denote @xmath200 the ( connected ) geometrical average of a quantity @xmath201 ( and as usual , @xmath235 its ensemble average ) .",
    "thus the observed moments of the measured convergence are @xmath236 where the summations are made over the @xmath237 different locations where the smoothed convergences are supposed to have been determined .",
    "we actually assume that the local convergences have been measured in a compact sample , of a size significantly larger than the smoothing length . in the geometrical averages it is also",
    "_ not _ excluded that the smoothing areas overlap , so that @xmath237 can actually be arbitrarily large . of course the resulting averages",
    "can not be arbitrarily accurate because the measured @xmath238 are correlated variables , and will be all the more correlated that they are measured in close directions .      in the following",
    "we not only estimate the errors due to the cosmic variance but also the effects of the intrinsic noise in the measurements due to the use of a limited number of tracers for the shear and of their intrinsic imperfections .",
    "so assume that the measured convergence in the direction @xmath239 is given by , @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the true cosmological value of the local convergence in the direction @xmath239 and @xmath196 is the error made in this same direction due to the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies .",
    "assuming the ellipticities of the galaxies are independent from one another , and using results obtained for their intrinsic ellipticities ( see for instance miralda - escud 1991b ) we get , @xmath242 where @xmath243 is the number of galaxies in a given smoothing angular cell . moreover two variables @xmath196 and @xmath244 are independent if the corresponding cells do not overlap , and they are all assumed to be independent of the true values of the local convergences .",
    "this is probably a rather simple and naive modelisation but we leave more accurate numerical studies of a more realistic modelisation for a further paper .",
    "as the variance of @xmath196 is independent of @xmath245 we will denote , @xmath197 their common rms fluctuation , @xmath246 and from the expected density of galaxies in a @xmath247 field ( about @xmath248 for the limit magnitudes @xmath249 or @xmath250 currently used in ultra - deep imaging ; tyson 1988 , smail et al .",
    "1995 ) we can estimate that @xmath251    we then define the random variable @xmath252 that describes the departure between an observed geometrical average and the corresponding ensemble average , @xmath253 and @xmath254 for @xmath255 . in the following",
    "we will assume that the cosmic random variables @xmath252 have a small variance compared to the variance at the smoothing scale .",
    "therefore the variables @xmath252 can be considered to follow a gaussian statistics and we will do the calculation at their dominant order .",
    "the knowledge of the cosmic errors in any of the considered measurements can then be derived from the values of the variances and cross - correlations between these variables .      to obtain the statistical properties of @xmath252 one",
    "can simply consider the ensemble average of the @xmath256 , of their squares and products . from the assumed properties of the variables",
    "@xmath196 and @xmath241 we have , @xmath257 where we have identified the geometrical average of @xmath258 with the variance of the local convergence at the scale of the sample , @xmath226 . at this scale",
    "we assume that the ensemble average of @xmath196 is negligible compared to the one of @xmath25 : it decreases like poisson noise , that is more rapidly than the variance of the convergence .",
    "the ensemble averages for the second moment read , @xmath259 where the calculations have been limited to the quadratic terms in @xmath197 and @xmath260 .",
    "the calculations make also intervene the geometrical averages of the joint moments @xmath261 which are evaluated in the previous appendix .",
    "for the third moment we have , @xmath262 we have also to consider the cross - correlations between those moments which give , @xmath263 from these results we have entirely define the statistical properties of the variables @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 .",
    "simple identifications lead to @xmath267 it is interesting to note that @xmath197 enters only in the expectation value of @xmath265 .    as a result",
    "we can calculate both the expectation value of a measured quantity and the variance of this measure . to do so the quantities we are interested in are expressed in terms of the random variables @xmath252 and expanded up to the quadratic order .",
    "this is a trivial calculation for the variance , and for the measured @xmath163 we have @xmath268 of course this expansion is correct only if the sample size is larger than the smoothing scale .",
    "then when we apply the previous rules on the variables @xmath252 and get @xmath204 one can distinguish two different effects of the cosmic variance for the uncertainties of the results .",
    "there is first a systematic shift proportional to the ratio of the variances . and",
    "secondly a cosmic scatter is expected to appear , which is directly proportional to the rms of the fluctuations of the convergence at the sample scale .",
    "it is thus crucial to have a catalogue as large as possible !    using the numerical results of the previous appendix we have @xmath269 the cosmic errors",
    "of course decreases with the size of the sample .",
    "what the previous results show is that the errors are already quite small when the size of the sample is @xmath192 and would allow , for a perfectly well known source distribution , a determination of the cosmological parameters at the 5 to 10% level .",
    "note that @xmath163 appears to be less sensitive to the cosmic variance because it is a ratio of moments ."
