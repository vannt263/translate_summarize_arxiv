    "what are the natural `` random loop ensemble '' analogs of the schramm - loewner evolution sle@xmath4 when the paths are simple ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) ?",
    "this is a natural question , as such families of loops should describe the scaling limits of the collection of interface loops appearing in various critical two - dimensional lattice models in statistical physics .",
    "one way to address the above question is to use the sle curves themselves . in this approach , which appears in @xcite ,",
    "one chooses a point @xmath8 on the boundary of a simply connected domain @xmath9 and launches from @xmath8 a branching sle@xmath10 process ( for @xmath5 in @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "the sle@xmath12 process is a natural variant of sle@xmath4 with a target - independence property ( see @xcite ) that allows one to construct a branching tree of such processes in a canonical way . using this `` exploration tree ''",
    ", one can define a random collection of loops , which was called a _",
    "conformal loop ensemble _ with parameter @xmath5 ( cle@xmath4 ) in @xcite .",
    "these loop ensembles are the conjectured scaling limits for various random models from statistical physics .",
    "for example , cle@xmath13 appears as the scaling limit of spin cluster boundaries of the critical ising model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that some features of these cle@xmath4 loop - ensembles are not easy to derive via this branching sle definition .",
    "for instance , the general question of whether their law is independent of the choice of the starting point @xmath8 ( the `` root '' of the branching - tree ) i.e. , whether these cle@xmath4 are invariant under all conformal maps from @xmath9 onto itself , remained open .",
    "a completely different approach , proposed in @xcite , is based on the brownian loop - soup . the brownian",
    "loop - soup is a random poissonian collection of brownian loops in a domain @xmath9 that inherits nice properties from brownian motion , including conformal invariance .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite , motivated by questions concerning restriction properties of sle processes in @xcite . in a loop - soup ,",
    "the brownian loops can intersect and therefore create clusters .",
    "the outer boundaries of these clusters are random conformally invariant curves .",
    "the way the laws of these curves vary when the boundary of the domain changes is related to the way the laws of sle curves vary ( these are the `` restriction properties '' of the curves ) , and it is therefore natural to think they are actually sle - type loops .",
    "the authors of the present paper recently showed in @xcite that any random collection of loops satisfying the so - called _ conformal restriction axioms _ must be one of the cle@xmath4 defined via the branching sle@xmath10 tree with @xmath5 in @xmath11 $ ] ( and that it could also be constructed via a poisson point process of sle@xmath4 excursions ) . in that paper ,",
    "the term cle was used to refer to any simple loop ensemble satisfying the conformal restriction axioms . there , as here , the scope was limited to simple loop ensembles ( where loops are disjoint and simple loops ) .",
    "it was not shown in either @xcite or @xcite ( and remained far from obvious ) that the cle@xmath4 actually satisfy the axioms ( in part because of the starting - point independence problem ) .",
    "in other words , it was proved that _ if _ any cle exist , then they must have the form cle@xmath4 for some @xmath5 in @xmath11 $ ] , but it was not proved that any cle exist , so the result was a rather conditional one .",
    "however , it becomes very useful when combined with the results of the present paper .    here",
    ", we will study properties of the brownian loop - soup clusters .",
    "we will describe properties of its `` subcritical phase '' and of its phase transition : a property of the decay rate of the size of clusters at the critical point , and the fact that the collection of `` loop - soup cluster outer boundaries '' satisfies the conformal restriction axioms introduced in @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to apply the results of that paper to deduce that these loup - soup boundaries are cle@xmath4 s .",
    "furthermore , this enables us to identify precisely the phase transition point of the loop - soup percolation , and to show that all cle@xmath4 s for @xmath14 $ ] can be constructed via brownian loop - soups .",
    "this therefore completes the program of @xcite , and in particular implies that the cle@xmath4 _ do _ in fact satisfy the conformal restriction axioms and that they are root - independent for all @xmath5 in @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "hence , we now have two remarkably different explicit constructions of these conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath4 for each @xmath5 in @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "this is useful , since many properties that seem very mysterious from one perspective are easy from the other .",
    "for example , the ( expectation ) fractal dimensions of the individual loops and of the set of points not surrounded by any loop can be explicitly computed with sle tools @xcite , while many monotonicity results and fkg - type correlation inequalities are immediate from the loop - soup construction @xcite .",
    "one illustration of the interplay between these two approaches is already present in this paper : one can use sle tools to determine exactly the value of the critical intensity that separates the two percolative phases of the brownian loop - soup ( and to our knowledge , this is the only self - similar percolation model where this is the case ) .",
    "another consequence of this identity between cle@xmath4 and brownian loop soup cluster boundaries , is the `` additivity property '' of cle s that we will describe in more detail later in the introduction : the union of two independent cle s defines another cle .",
    "the introductions of the papers @xcite contain additional history and motivation , and we refer the interested reader to them .",
    "let us also mention that the present paper gives an interpretation of the _ central charge _",
    "@xmath0 of models ( as usually defined in theoretical physics ) for @xmath0 in @xmath15 $ ] as the intensity of the underlying brownian loop - soup .",
    "the brownian loop - soup , as defined in @xcite , is a poissonian random countable collection of brownian loops contained within a fixed simply - connected domain @xmath9 .",
    "we will actually only need to consider the outer boundaries of the brownian loops , so we will take the perspective that a loop - soup is a random countable collection of simple loops ( outer boudaries of brownian loops can be defined as sle@xmath16 loops , see @xcite ) .",
    "let us stress that the conformal loop ensembles cle@xmath4 , with @xmath17 $ ] , are also random collections of simple loops , but that , unlike the loops of the brownian loop - soup , the loops in a cle are almost surely disjoint from one another .",
    "random collections of loops can be formally defined using the notational framework of @xcite , which we briefly review here : a simple loop in the complex plane @xmath18 is the image of the unit circle in @xmath18 under a continuous injective map .",
    "a simple loop @xmath19 separates @xmath18 into two connected components that we call its interior @xmath20 ( the bounded one ) and its exterior ( the unbounded one ) .",
    "we endow the space @xmath21 of simple loops with the @xmath22-field @xmath23 generated by all the events of the type @xmath24 when @xmath25 spans the set of open sets in the unit plane .",
    "note that this @xmath22-field is also generated by the events of the type @xmath26 where @xmath27 spans a countable dense subset @xmath28 of the plane ( recall that we are considering simple loops so that @xmath29 as soon as @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath23 is equivalent to the borel @xmath22-algebra of the hausdorff metric on @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the following extension is also natural : let @xmath31 be the set of _ all _ closed bounded subsets of @xmath18 and @xmath32 the borel @xmath22-algebra of the hausdorff metric on @xmath31 .",
    "a countable collection @xmath33 of simple loops can be identified with a point - measure @xmath34 . the space @xmath35 of countable collections of elements of @xmath36 is naturally equipped with the @xmath22-field @xmath37 generated by the sets @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , there is an obvious extension : the space @xmath40 of countable collections of elements of @xmath41 is naturally equipped with the @xmath22-field @xmath42 generated by the sets @xmath38 , where @xmath43 .",
    "the loops of the _ brownian loop - soup _ @xmath44 in the unit disk @xmath45 are the points of a poisson point process with intensity @xmath46 , where @xmath0 is an _ intensity _ constant , and @xmath47 is the _",
    "brownian loop measure in @xmath45 _ on @xmath48 .",
    "the brownian loop - soup measure @xmath49 is the corresponding probability measure on @xmath50 . when @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two closed bounded subsets of a bounded domain @xmath9 , we denote by @xmath53 the @xmath47-mass of the set of loops that intersect both sets @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and stay in @xmath9 .",
    "when the distance between @xmath51 and @xmath52 is positive , this mass is finite @xcite .",
    "similarly , for each fixed positive @xmath54 , the set of loops that stay in the bounded domain @xmath9 and have diameter larger than @xmath54 , has finite mass for @xmath47 .    the conformal restriction property of the brownian loop measure @xmath47 ( which in fact characterizes the measure up to a multiplicative constant ;",
    "see @xcite ) implies the following two facts ( which are essentially the only features of the brownian loop - soup that we shall use in the present paper ) :    1 .",
    "conformal invariance : the measure @xmath55 is invariant under any moebius transformation of the unit disc onto itself .",
    "this invariance makes it in fact possible to define the law @xmath56 of the loop - soup in any simply connected domain @xmath57 as the law of the image of @xmath58 under any given conformal map @xmath59 from @xmath45 onto @xmath9 ( because the law of this image does not depend on the actual choice of @xmath59 ) .",
    "restriction : if one restricts a loop - soup in @xmath45 to those loops that stay in a simply connected domain @xmath60 , one gets a sample of @xmath61",
    ".    we will work with the usual definition ( i.e. , the usual normalization ) of the measure @xmath47 ( as in @xcite  note that there is often some confusion about a factor @xmath62 in the definition , related to whether one keeps track of the orientation of the brownian loops or not ) . since we will be talking about some explicit values of @xmath0 later",
    ", it is important to specify this normalization . for a direct definition of the measure @xmath47 in terms of brownian loops , see @xcite .",
    "we now describe the axioms introduced in @xcite .",

    "we will derive the following correspondence :    [ kappacorrespondence ] fix @xmath90 $ ] and let @xmath58 be a brownian loop - soup of intensity @xmath0 on @xmath45 . then @xmath74 is a cle@xmath4 where @xmath17 $ ] is determined by the relation @xmath92 .    since every @xmath17 $ ]",
    "is obtained for exactly one value of @xmath90 $ ] , this implies the following :    the random simple loop configurations satisfying the conformal restriction axioms are precisely the cle@xmath4 where @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "recall from @xcite that the hausdorff dimension of an sle@xmath4 curve is almost surely @xmath93 .",
    "our results therefore imply that the boundary of a loop - soup cluster of intensity @xmath94 has dimension @xmath95 note that just as for mandelbrot s conjecture for the dimension of brownian boundaries @xcite , this statement does not involve sle , but its proof does .",
    "in fact the result about the dimension of brownian boundaries can be viewed as the limit when @xmath96 of this one .",
    "furthermore we may define the _ carpet _ of the cle@xmath4 to be the random closed set @xmath97 , and recall that sle methods allowed @xcite to compute its `` expectation dimension '' in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "the present loop - soup construction of cle@xmath4 enables to prove ( see @xcite ) that this expectation dimension is indeed equal to its almost sure hausdorff dimension @xmath98 , and that in terms of @xmath0 , @xmath99 the critical loop - soup ( for @xmath3 ) corresponds therefore to a carpet of dimension @xmath100 .",
    "another direct consequence of the previous results is the `` additivity property '' of cle s : if one considers two independent cle s in the same simply connected domain @xmath9 with non - empty boundary , and looks at the union of these two , then either one can find a cluster whose boundary contains @xmath101 , or the outer boundaries of the obtained outermost clusters in this union form another cle .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that each of the cle s can be constructed via brownian loop soups ( of some intensities @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) so that the union corresponds to a brownian loop - soup of intensity @xmath104 .",
    "this gives for instance a clean direct geometric meaning to the general idea ( present on various occasions in the physics literature ) that relates in some way two independent copies of the ising model to the gaussian free field in their large scale limit : the outermost boundaries defined by the union of two independent cle@xmath13 s in a domain ( recall @xcite that cle@xmath13 is the scaling limit of the ising model loops , and note that it corresponds to @xmath105 ) form a cle@xmath106 ( which corresponds to level lines of the gaussian free field , see @xcite and to @xmath107 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we first study some properties of the brownian loop - soup and of the clusters it defines .",
    "the main result of section [ s.2 ] is that when @xmath0 is not too large ( i.e. is subcritical ) , the outer boundaries of outermost brownian loop - soup clusters formally a random collection of disjoint simple loops that does indeed satisfy the conformal restriction axioms . by the main result of @xcite",
    ", this implies that they are cle@xmath4 ensembles for some @xmath5 . in section [ s.3 ] ,",
    "we compare how loop - soups and sle@xmath4 curves behave when one changes the domain that they are defined in , and we deduce from this the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 in this subcritical phase . in section [ s.4 ] , we show that if the size of the clusters in a brownian loop - soup satisfy a certain decay rate property , then the corresponding @xmath0 is necessary _ strictly _ subcritical .",
    "this enables to show that the loop - soup corresponding to @xmath108 is the only possible critical one , and completes the identification of all cle@xmath4 s for @xmath14 $ ] as loop - soup cluster boundaries .",
    "the present paper is closely related to various other work on sle and cle , but it will in fact directly use sle results on only three distinct occasions : we use the main result of @xcite at the begining of section [ s.3 ] , we use the standard sle restriction properties from @xcite and the description of cle in terms of sle excursions derived in @xcite in section [ s.3 ] , and finally an estimate about the size of an sle@xmath4 excursion borrowed from @xcite in section [ s.4 ] .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove the following proposition :    [ p.satisfiesconformal ] there exists a positive constant @xmath109 such that for all @xmath0 in @xmath110 , the set @xmath74 satisfies the conformal restriction axioms , whereas when @xmath0 is ( strictly ) greater than @xmath109 , @xmath58 has only one cluster almost surely .    in the present section",

    "for each @xmath114 , and for each union @xmath117 of such dyadic squares the loop - soup restricted to @xmath117 is independent of the event @xmath118 .",
    "it implies immediately that conditionally on @xmath77 , the set of loops that do stay in @xmath119 is distributed like a brownian loop - soup in @xmath119 . since this holds for all @xmath120 , the statement of the lemma follows .",
    "[ l.biggerc-onecluster ] suppose that @xmath121 and that there is a @xmath55 positive probability that @xmath85 contains an element intersecting the boundary of @xmath45 .",

    "by invariance under rotation , @xmath126 .",
    "using the same argument as in the previous lemma , we get that if @xmath76 is a fixed open set such that @xmath127 , then conditioned on the event @xmath128 , the law of the set of loops in @xmath58 that are contained in @xmath76 is the same as its original law ( since changing the set of loops within @xmath76 has no effect on @xmath124 ) .",
    "since this holds for any @xmath76 , conformal invariance of the loop soup implies that conditioned on @xmath124 , the law of the elements of @xmath58 that do not intersect @xmath129 is that of independent copies of @xmath58 conformally mapped to each component of @xmath130 . note that this in fact implies that the event that @xmath124 is empty is independent of @xmath58 , and hence has probability zero or one ( but we will not really need this ) .",
    "the conformal radius @xmath131 of @xmath130 seen from @xmath132 has a strictly positive probability to be smaller than one .",
    "we now iterate the previous procedure : we let @xmath133 denote the connected component of @xmath134 that contains the origin .",
    "note that the harmonic measure of @xmath135 at @xmath132 in @xmath136 is clearly not smaller than the harmonic measure of @xmath125 in @xmath45 at @xmath132 ( a brownian motion started at the origin that exits @xmath45 in @xmath125 with necessarily exit @xmath136 through @xmath137 ) .",
    "we now consider the loop - soup in this domain @xmath133 , and we let @xmath138 denote the union of all loop - soup clusters that touch @xmath137 .",
    "we then iterate the procedure , and note that the conformal radius of @xmath139 ( from @xmath132 ) is dominated by a product of i.i.d .",

    "it is easy to check that the same is true if we replace the origin by any fixed point @xmath146 .",

    "furthermore , for an analogous reason , almost surely , any loop of @xmath148 intersects some loop of @xmath58 .",
