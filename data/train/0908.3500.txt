    "dwarf galaxies are the most common galaxies in the local group ( lg ) , and probably in the entire universe . as the closest late - type star - forming dwarf",
    ", the smc is an ideal laboratory for a detailed study of these very common objects : its low dust and high gas content , as well as its low present - day metallicity ( z=0.004 ) , make it an excellent local analog to the majority of dwarf irregulars and blue compact galaxies , whose metallicity distribution is peaked at this mean value . as a member of a triple system ,",
    "the smc is also a natural benchmark to study interaction - driven modulations of the sf activity .",
    "furthermore its proximity ( 60.6 kpc , corresponding to a distance modulus @xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) allows us to resolve into single stars its stellar populations well below its oldest main sequence turn off ( msto ) , and thus to study in detail its star formation history ( sfh ) over a hubble time by exploring ages , metallicities , and spatial distribution of its stellar content .",
    "the properties of old ( age@xmath5 gyr ) and intermediate ( 2@xmath6 age@xmath5 gyr ) stellar populations can help us understand the formation and evolution of the lg .",
    "deep photometric studies of a number of dwarf galaxies have demonstrated that some of them started to form stars at the same epoch : the oldest globular clusters in the milky way ( mw ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , sagittarius , and fornax are coeval , and similar results have been obtained for the oldest stars in the fields of the milky way , fornax , draco , ursa minor , sculptor , carina and leoii @xcite . by contrast , the oldest ( and only ) globular cluster in the smc is @xmath1 gyr younger than the oldest globulars in the milky way @xcite .    while it is clear that the oldest surviving smc cluster is younger than the oldest clusters in other lg galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we still do not know whether the onset of sf in the smc , and possibly in other galaxies , was also delayed compared to the mw . to answer this question we need to analyze the smc field - star population .",
    "however , thus far only a few authors have investigated the sf history ( sfh ) of field stars in the smc . a first evidence of a stellar population older than 9 - 10 gyr comes from the detection of rr - lyrae stars @xcite",
    ". however the overall small number ( @xmath7 arcsec@xmath8 ) of rr - lyrae found in the smc bar @xcite suggests that in the first 2 - 3 gyr the star formation rate in the smc was low .",
    "@xcite have performed the most extensive study of the sfh of the smc , covering @xmath9 to a depth of @xmath10 .",
    "they found that the smc formed approximately 50% of all its stars more than 8.4 gyr ago , and only a few stars between 3 and 8.4 gyr ago . in the last 3 gyr , the smc formed stars at a constant rate , with two bursts occurred approximately 2.5 and 0.4 gyr ago .",
    "@xcite suggested that these two events may have been triggered by the perigalactic passages of the smc with the milky way .",
    "other authors have focused on smaller regions , but with deeper and better photometry .",
    "the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) was used to analyzed the stellar content of the smc wing @xcite , and in the vicinity of some smc star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . according to @xcite wing stars formed during a long episode of formation between 3.5 and 12 gyr ago , followed by a period of quiescence with a very recent ( @xmath3 myr ago )",
    "pick up in sf activity .",
    "@xcite found periods of enhanced sf 0.3 - 0.4 , 3 - 4 and 6 gyr ago , and that sf in the smc was likely quiescent at earlier epochs .",
    "@xcite presented the first analysis of the stellar content in the outskirts of the smc using ground - based data .",
    "they found that stars in the outskirts of the smc formed during a prolonged episode of sf between 2.5 and 15 gyr ago , with a progressive chemical enrichment from [ fe / h]@xmath111.4 up to [ fe / h]@xmath110.7 .",
    "@xcite presented a deep ground - based study of 12 fields of the smc .",
    "due to the high crowding conditions , they avoided the densest regions , such as the bar . in all their fields",
    "the intermediate - age ( @xmath12 gyr ) population is the dominant component , while the younger stars have a more asymmetric distribution , peaked in the wing .",
    "none of their fields showed a clear extended horizontal branch ( hb ) , which would indicate a very old stellar population . from this they concluded that the smc formed only a few stars at the beginning , and experienced an intense and prolonged period of sf between 1 and 6 gyr ago .",
    "finally , @xcite derived the sfh of the hst field around the young star - forming cluster ngc  602 in the smc wing , where many pre - main sequence stars are also present , finding that the current sf activity is similar to that of galactic ob associations , that the bulk of the old stars are 6 - 8 gyr old , and with only few stars older than @xmath138 gyr .    in order to get a more accurate and complete evaluation of the sfh of the smc from the earliest epochs up to the present day , and also to extend the analysis to the densest regions , we have started a long - term project ( the small magellanic cloud in space and time ) aimed at getting deep and tight color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of several selected smc fields with hst , and in addition covering the whole galaxy down to several magnitudes below the oldest msto using the vlt survey telescope ( vst ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary goals of this project are to combine deep and accurate photometry with high and intermediate - resolution spectra in order to map the sfh and abundance variations across the whole galaxy .",
    "these data will allow us to determine the age - metallicity relation ( if there is one ) of stars in different regions of the galaxy and to better constrain numerical models for the chemical evolution of the various smc regions as well as for the galaxy as a whole .",
    "we will study the spatial distribution of the various types of variables and this will provide unique information on the space and time confinement of the formation of their parent stellar populations and on the 3d structure of the galaxy . finally the sfh will be derived from the color - magnitude diagrams using the synthetic cmd technique to study how , when and where the sf occurred in the smc . by combining the age - metallicity relation with the sfh through the galaxy we will be able to model the chemical evolution of the smc with unprecedented accuracy for an external galaxy , reaching the same level of reliability that has been attained only for the solar neighborhood .    in this paper we present the stellar content of six fields observed with hst in the smc bar ( sfh1 , sfh4 , and sfh5 ) , wing ( sfh9 and sfh10 ) and the smc outskirts ( sfh8 ) .",
    "all the regions have been observed with the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) . to our knowledge",
    "this study represents the deepest and highest - resolution survey ever published for smc fields .",
    "the sfh , as derived from the synthetic cmd technique , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( cignoni et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ",
    "[ obs ] we present the data sets and discuss their reduction . section ",
    "[ at ] presents artificial - star tests and photometric completeness .",
    "the fields are discussed in   [ 6fields ] , while a more detailed characterization of the stellar content of the various smc regions ( bar , wing and outskirts ) is given in   [ stellar content ] . section   [ conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "six smc fields were observed with the acs / wfc between november 2005 and january 2006 , as a part of a project ( go-10396 ; p.i .",
    "j. s. gallagher , iii ) devoted to characterizing the properties of intermediate and old clusters @xcite , as well as to studying the field populations to infer the sfh of the smc .",
    "the fields were selected to sample the stellar content in regions characterized by different stellar and gas density , and possibly different sfhs .",
    "the locations of the observed fields within the smc are shown in figure  [ f : targets ] .",
    "for each field we acquired 3 - 4 @xmath2 seconds long exposures both with the f555w ( @xmath13 v ) and f814w ( @xmath13 i ) filters , ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a detailed description of acs filters ) , and shorter exposures to recover the brighter stars that saturate in the longer exposures .",
    "the exposure times and dates of observations are listed in table  [ t : obs ] .",
    "the observations are the long exposures were acquired following a standard dither pattern that allowed us to cover the gap between the two chips of the acs / wfc detector , to better sample the psf and to better differentiate real sources from warm pixels or cosmic rays .",
    "wfc images cover an area of @xmath14 with a scale of @xmath15pixel . from the analysis of more than 50 eclipsing binaries , scattered over the whole galaxy , that therefore should be well representative of the mean distance value , @xcite derived a distance modulus @xmath16 for the smc .",
    "corresponding to a distance of @xmath17 kpc , this implies that in each field we observed an area @xmath18 pc@xmath19 .",
    "the data sets were processed according to the standard space telescope science institute acs calibration pipeline ( calacs ) , which subtracts the bias level and applies the flat - field and overscan corrections .",
    "the pipeline - corrected ( flt ) images are still in the raw - detector pixel frame and therefore retain several kinds of distortion .",
    "the photometric analysis was carried out directly on the flt images .",
    "for each pointing and filter , positions and fluxes for all of the brighter stars ( signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath20 ) were measured in all the flt images , using the program img2xym_wfc.09x10 @xcite .",
    "the program uses a library of empirical psfs , that take into account spatial variations in the wfc psf , due to the telescope optics and the variable charge diffusion in the ccd @xcite .",
    "the psf in each image can differ from the library psf due to focus changes caused by spacecraft breathing .",
    "it is possible to take into account these differences by introducing for each exposure an appropriate spatially constant perturbation .",
    "this perturbation is obtained by fitting the library psf to the brighter ( s / n@xmath20 ) stars . in doing this",
    "we obtained a tailor - made psf for each image . for each pointing",
    "we adopted a f555w deep exposure as the `` reference '' frame and we found a six parameter linear transformation from the distortion corrected frame of each flt image into this frame , using the position of the stars in common .    for each of the flt images",
    "the position of all the stars was transformed in the reference frame and an average position and flux was computed for each filter .",
    "the root mean square residuals for the average positions of the stars were better than 0.01 pixel in each coordinate , and the photometric residuals were about 0.01 mag for the bright stars ( s / n@xmath20 ) .    using the reference list of stars for each field , we computed the final photometric zero points from both short and long exposures .",
    "once we had created a photometric and astrometric mapping for each exposure , we used the program described in @xcite , designed for the globular cluster treasury program ( go-10775 .",
    "a. sarajedini ) , to refine the photometry .",
    "this routine analyzes the reference frame with 25@xmath21 pixel patch at a time in an automated way . for each patch",
    ", the program reads in the relevant portion of each exposure and searches all the exposures simultaneously in multiple passes .",
    "the brightest stars are found and subtracted first to allow the finding of the fainter stars .    once all the stars have been found",
    ", the program fits all the exposures simultaneously for a single reference - frame position and a 2 filters ( f555w and f814w in our case ) flux .",
    "the process is then repeated for the next patch until the entire field is covered .",
    "in addition to the simultaneous fit of fluxes , the program also measures each star in each individual flt exposure where it could be found . after subtracting its neighbors ,",
    "the routine determines a sky value in an annulus between 3 and 7 pixels from the center of the star for the fainter stars and between 4 and 8 pixels for the brighter stars , and then fits the psf to the central @xmath22 pixels . in this way for each field in each of the two filters we obtained between three and four independent estimates of the position and magnitude for each star in the long exposures , and 1 or 2 in the short one .",
    "to remove as many spurious detections as possible from the final catalogs , we considered for each filter only the stars that were identified in at least three exposures with a positional error smaller than @xmath23 pixel . with these selection criteria , the final catalog of the field sfh1 contains 29217 stars , 17384 stars were found in sfh4 , 19769 stars in sfh5 , 9180 stars in sfh10 , and only 2659 stars in sfh9 and 1564 stars in sfh8 .",
    "the calibration recipe by @xcite for all the filters available in acs is derived for the drizzled images , thus this calibration can not be directly applied to our photometric catalogs .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of the drizzled images using daophot in iraf to obtain vegamag calibrated magnitudes for both the f555w and f814w filters for many isolated stars in each of our fields , and used these stars to convert the instrumental magnitudes into the vegamag system .",
    "artificial - star tests are a standard procedure to test the level of completeness and accuracy of a photometric analysis .",
    "the tests are performed by inserting stars with known position and flux into the dataset , and then repeating the photometric analysis as was used for the real stars .",
    "the difference between the input and output magnitudes of the recovered artificial stars provides an estimate of the photometric error and shows if , and how much , the data are affected by blending of nearby unresolved objects .",
    "the routine used for the photometry analyzes the reference frame with 25@xmath21 pixel patch at a time and , for each patch , the program reads the relevant portion of each exposure and searches all the exposures simultaneously in multiple passes .",
    "the same routine @xcite allows us to add one artificial star in a patch and then it analyzes the data in exactly the same way described in   [ obs ] .",
    "this approach avoids the concern that artificial stars may interact with each other . for each field",
    "we simulated more than 1,000,000 artificial stars in each of the f555w and f814w deep exposures .",
    "in our analysis we considered an artificial - star as recovered if its input and output fluxes agree to within 0.75 magnitudes .",
    "as in the real - stars photometric analysis , we also required that each star be found in at least three exposures with a positional error @xmath23 pixels for filter .",
    "figure  [ f : dmi ] shows the difference between input and output magnitudes of the recovered artificial - stars in both the filters for sfh1 .",
    "the completeness fraction of each field is shown in figure  [ f : compl ] .",
    "photometric errors , as derived from the difference between input and output magnitudes of the recovered artificial - stars , are plotted on the right side of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in figure  [ f : cmds ] .",
    "in order to get a more accurate and complete evaluation of the sfh of the smc from the earliest epochs up to the present day , and also to extend the analysis to the densest regions , we have observed six fields in the smc with acs / wfc .",
    "the fields were selected to sample regions characterized by different stellar and gas densities , such as the smc bar , wing and the outskirts .",
    "our survey was focused on the stellar content in the field of the smc , therefore we avoided any known ob association , and star cluster . because of the complex history of tidal interactions of the smc with the lmc , and between the magellanic clouds and the mw it is possible that these regions have different histories of sf .",
    "we selected three fields in the smc bar ( sfh1 , sfh4 , and sfh5  fig .",
    "[ f : targets ] ) .",
    "sfh1 is the region closest ( @xmath24 ) to the optical center of the smc .",
    "it is located to the sw of the smc bar , where the stellar density , gas and dust content are highest .",
    "ground - based photometry @xcite , as well as several ionized nebulae @xcite indicate recent episodes of sf .",
    "the identification of young stellar objects ( ysos ) associated with many of the ionized nebulae @xcite shows that sf is still high in the region .",
    "sfh4 is located to the ne of the smc center , @xmath25 from the optical center of the smc , and @xmath24 south of ngc  346 , the most active star forming region in the smc .",
    "finally sfh5 is at the boundary between the smc bar and the wing , @xmath26 north of the optical center of the smc .    in optical images",
    ", the smc wing appears as a large cloud of faint stars , located to the east side of the smc bar , toward the lmc , and is considered to be part of a tidal tail torn off the main body of the smc by tidal interactions between the two magellanic clouds ( mcs ) .",
    "we selected two regions to characterize the stellar populations in the wing : sfh10 in the center of the wing , and sfh9 closer to the magellanic bridge connecting the two clouds ( fig .",
    "[ f : targets ] ) .",
    "the properties of regions in the outskirts of the smc are poorly constrained .",
    "recently @xcite detected intermediate age and old stars that belong to the smc at @xmath27 kpc from the center of the smc in the southern direction , suggesting that the smc may be larger than previously thought . to investigate the properties of the stars in another part of the outskirts of the smc we observed one field ( sfh8 ) located at @xmath28 north - west from the smc optical center ( in the opposite direction with respect to the wing ) .",
    "being far from the regions of recent sf , sfh8 will give us the best chance to isolate the oldest and most metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ f : cmds ] shows the @xmath29 versus @xmath30 cmds obtained from the photometric analysis of the six fields . in all the regions our photometry reaches @xmath31 magnitudes below the faintest / oldest msto ,",
    "that , assuming a distance modulus @xmath4 and a metallicity z=0.001 , according to padua isochrones @xcite should be at @xmath32 .",
    "as in all resolved galaxies , there is a clear stellar density gradient from the center of the smc to its periphery ; the field containing the largest number of stars ( 29217 ; sfh1 ) is in the bar , and that with the lowest number ( 1564 ) in the smc outskirts ( sfh8 ) . with the exception of sfh8 ,",
    "all the fields show the blue plume , typical of late - type dwarf galaxies , populated by high- and intermediate- mass stars in the main - sequence ( ms ) phase or at the blue edge of the blue loops ( corresponding to the central he - burning phase ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the contrast between the two most external fields sfh8 and sfh9 : in the latter , located in the outer wing , in spite of the low stellar density the blue plume is well populated by young stars .",
    "an inspection by eye of the six cmds reveals that stellar populations of very different ages are present in each area .    : with the exception of sfh8 ( fig .",
    "[ f : cmds ] ) , all the cmds present a stellar population younger than @xmath33 gyr , as indicated by the bright ( @xmath34 ) and blue ( @xmath35 ) well populated ms .",
    "this is also supported by the concentration of stars above the red clump ( rc ) in the magnitude range @xmath36 and color ranges @xmath37 , that corresponds to the lower end of the blue edge of the blue loop .",
    "a careful inspection reveals differences from cmd to cmd , suggesting that recent ( age@xmath38 myr ) episodes of sf might have developed locally .    :",
    "a stellar population older than @xmath39 gyr is easily distinguishable in each cmd .",
    "evolutionary phases associated with this population are the well defined lower ms , which extends from @xmath40 down to @xmath41 , the broad subgiant branch ( sgb ) , visible between @xmath42 in the color range @xmath43 , the red giant branch ( rgb ) , well defined by the brightest stars at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and the red clump ( rc ) at @xmath46 .",
    "asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars seem to be present as well , but in most cases are difficult to distinguish from the rgb .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ f : cmds ] indicate the nominal position of the hb .",
    "hb stars are unequivocal indicators of a stellar population older than @xmath47 gyr . a few stars in sfh1 , 4 , and 5 have colors and magnitudes consistent with being hb stars , however their low number does not allow us to confirm the presence of hb stars in any of the analyzed regions .",
    "this may imply either that the smc formed very few stars in the first 2 - 3 gyr , or that even the oldest stars have a relatively high metallicity .",
    "even so , many rr - lyrae stars have been identified in the whole smc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , confirming the presence of a metal - poor stellar population older than 10 gyr .",
    "future surveys devoted to identifying all the variable stars in the smc ( i.e. with the eso survey telescopes vista , in the ir , and vst , in the optical bands ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) will provide a complete census of the rr - lyrae stars across the entire smc , thus allowing us to fully trace the spatial distribution of the oldest populations .",
    "if some of the possible hb stars are eventually found to be rr - lyraes , this will confirm the presence of an hb in these fields . in ",
    "[ stellar content ] we will compare the properties of the msto and the evolved phases ( sgb and rgb ) to theoretical isochrones to investigate if a stellar population older than @xmath47 gyr is present .      at first glance , the stellar populations older than @xmath39 gyr in the six fields appear fairly similar to each other , with no striking variations in the magnitudes of the sgbs , in the colors of the old mstos or in the magnitude and color of the rcs .",
    "however , a more careful analysis shows some interesting differences .",
    "even though rcs are clearly visible in sfh8 and 9 , the low number of stars does not allow us to discuss their morphology .",
    "fields sfh1 , sfh4 , sfh5 and sfh10 , on the contrary , show very prominent rcs ( fig .  [",
    "f : rcs ] ) , which vary both in shape and color extension . of these four fields , sfh5 has the bluest rc , with the majority of the stars concentrated between ( @xmath48 ) , but a fainter and even bluer feature is visible at ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this feature corresponds to the central helium - burning phase of stars at the low - mass end of the intermediate - mass interval ( i.e. m@xmath50 ) , and it has been both predicted and observed in other fields of the smc and lmc ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "the rc in sfh10 looks quite similar to that in sfh5 ( @xmath51 , even if the bluer and fainter rc is less visible because of the lower number of stars .",
    "the rc is redder in sfh4 ( @xmath52 ) , suggesting either an increase in the local reddening , or a higher metallicity . in sfh1",
    "the rc has a curved shape and a broad color extension ( @xmath53 ) , suggesting a spread in age and metallicity , as well as possible differential reddening .",
    "in addition to differential reddening and multiple ages , a spread in distance can also cause a broadening of the rc .",
    "different authors have derived rather different distance moduli for the smc star clusters , even within the same survey ( e.g. mathewson et al .",
    "1988 ; hatzidimitriou et al . 1993 ; crowl , et al . 2001 ; lah , et al .",
    "2005 ; glatt et al .",

    "figure  [ f : rc_lf ] shows the luminosity function ( lf ) in the f814w filter for the six rcs .",
    "the lfs have been obtained by considering only stars in the color range ( @xmath54 ) and brighter than @xmath55 .",
    "we used a gaussian fit to derive mean magnitude .",
    "the obtained values are listed in table  [ t : fields ] .",
    "the dispersion in magnitude ( table  [ t : fields ] ) of the red clump is due to the spread in age , metallicity , reddening , and depth .",
    "although not as robust as other standard candles , such as the rgb tip or the period - luminosity relations of pulsating stars , the magnitude of the rc can be used to estimate the distance , once reddening , metallicity and age of the stellar population have been taken into account . to derive the average distance modulus @xmath56 for each of the observed fields",

    "the mean distance modulus @xmath58 is consistent with @xcite estimate .",
    "even if theoretical isochrones do not allow us to put constraints on the intensity of sf episodes , or on their duration , they can be used to infer when major episodes occurred in an observed region .",

    "they found that stars older than 3 gyr are more metal - poor than [ fe / h]@xmath62.4 , stars between 1 and 3 gyr have a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath111.0 , and stars younger than @xmath63 myr have even higher metallicity .",

    "we find only a few stars with magnitudes and colors consistent with an hb , suggesting that in the first few billion years sf in this region was low .",
    "this is also supported by the small number in the sgb - lf of faint ( @xmath78 ) sgb stars ( @xmath79% ) older than @xmath80 gyr .",
    "we found that z=0.001 isochrones 2.5 gyr old predict colors that are too blue for both the msto and the rgb , suggesting that the interstellar medium was already relatively enriched at that time .",
    "we used z=0.004 isochrones to fit stars younger than 1 gyr .",
    "the well - populated ums suggests that in sfh1 stars were probably formed continuously from @xmath63 myr ago to @xmath3 myr ago .",
    "the concentration of he burning stars above the rc ( @xmath81 ) corresponds to the lower end of the blue edge of the blue loop .",
    "these stars formed between 400 and 500 myr ago . in order to quantify the relative intensity of the sf occurring @xmath2 myr ago among the six field , we considered the ratio between the he burning stars above the rc and the stars in the rc ( bl / rc ) . for this test we considered as blue loop stars those in the magnitude @xmath82 and color ranges @xmath83 , while we counted as rc stars those between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the average bl / rc=0.2 , while in sfh1 it rises up to bl / rc=0.4 ; thus @xmath2 myr ago this was the most actively star forming region in our survey .",
    "the evolved bright stars with intermediate colors ( @xmath86 ) indicate that sf has been active in the last 400 myr , however since the bright blue loop is not as well defined as above the rc , it is possible that the star formation rate ( sfr ) has decreased over the last few hundred myr .",
    "the very blue ( @xmath87 ) and bright ( @xmath88 ) stars indicate that sf was still ongoing 20 - 30 myr ago , in agreement with the circumstance that we are watching a region close to a very active part of the smc .",
    "sfh5 is the second densest region of our survey ( @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath90 ) .",
    "the best fit to the blue edge of the ums is obtained by adopting a reddening e(b - v)=0.06 . of our six regions , this is the one with the best - defined ( tight and well populated ) evolutionary sequences . the rgb is tighter than that in sfh1 , suggesting a smaller range of metallicities , or a less variable reddening .",
    "this is also supported by the smaller color spread of the rc ( figure  [ f : rcs ]  upper right panel ) , and by the group of stars fainter and bluer than the clump , corresponding to the lowest mass stars ( m@xmath91 ) that could ignite helium nuclear reactions in a non degenerate core .",

    "stars in the blue loop above the rc ( @xmath96 ) suggest that sf increased @xmath2 myr ago .",

    "isochrones younger than 3 gyr predict too blue colors for the ms and rgb , suggesting a higher metallicity .",
    "the most recent episode of sf likely occurred between @xmath68 and 200 myr ago , while the blue loop stars above the rc suggest a moderate activity about @xmath2 myr ago ( bl / rc=0.13 ) .",
    "the comparison of the three innermost regions shows that the smc formed stars in the first 10 - 12 gyr with a possible major episode occurring between 6 and 4 gyr ago .",
    "we found a progressive chemical enrichment with stars older than 2 - 3 gyr being more metal poor ( z=0.001 ) , than stars younger than @xmath61 gyr ( z=0.004 ) .",
    "isochrone fitting does not allow us to infer any information about the sfr , but we can combine it with the color function ( cf ) to highlight relative differences in the intensity of star - forming episodes .",
    "a cf plots the number of stars of different colors .",
    "figure  [ f : cf ] shows the cfs obtained for the six smc regions discussed in this paper . in each plot we considered only stars above the oldest msto ( @xmath105 )",
    "this selection guarantees that bias effects due to incompleteness are negligible . in each plot",
    "the cf has been normalized to the total number of stars brighter than @xmath105 , and corrected for the reddening value derived from the isochrone fitting to the ums described above .    in all the cfs of figure",
    "[ f : cf ] we notice that the majority of the stars have @xmath106 .",
    "the peaks of all fields coincide with each other at @xmath107 , thus confirming our estimate of the relative differences in the local reddening values .",
    "this peak is mostly populated by old and intermediate age stars in ms and sgb evolutionary phases .",
    "in particular , it is the locus of the low - mass ( m@xmath108 ) msto stars .    the redder ( @xmath109 ) secondary maximum in the cfs corresponds to evolved stars : the end of the sgb , rgb , rc , agb , and red supergiants . in our cases",
    "the main contribution comes from sgb , rc and rgb stars , as such this peak is representative of a stellar population older than 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "this color of peak is sensitive to age and metallicity .",
    "the bluer side ( @xmath110 ) of the cfs contains intermediate and massive stars in ms and at the blue edge of the blue loop evolutionary phases , and is representative of a stellar population younger than @xmath63 myr .",
    "the relative strength of the secondary blue peak with respect to the red one gives an indication of the fraction of young to old stars .",
    "hence , we can use the relative intensity of the peaks to infer when a region was more active with respect to another .",
    "for instance , we found that in sfh1 33% of the stars brighter than @xmath111 are bluer ( younger than 800 myr ) , while in sfh4 only 19% of the stars have such blue colors . in sfh5",
    "the fraction of blue stars is 21% .",
    "we also note that the morphologies of the blue side of these three cfs are quite different : sfh1 presents a clear peak at @xmath112 , while in sfh4 we observe a smooth decrease in stellar counts .",
    "the cf in sfh5 shows a plateau between @xmath113 and also has a shorter color extension toward the blue compared to the other two regions .",
    "this comparison again suggests that in the last billion years sfh1 was the most active region , and that a sizeable fraction of its stars were formed @xmath114 myr ago .",
    "this region continued to form stars until @xmath115 myr ago , but at a lower rate .",
    "sfh4 formed stars probably at a steadier pace than sfh1 . finally , the younger stellar population of sfh5 formed mainly between 200 and 400 myr ago .      the tidal interaction between the magellanic clouds is considered to be at the origin of the wing . from the analysis of a small portion of the smc wing , @xcite concluded that stars in the wing formed during a prolonged episode of sf between 3.5 and 12 gyr ago .",
    "their ms is well populated up to v=17.8 , indicating very recent star forming activity . from isochrone fitting they concluded that the youngest stars can not be older than 100 myr , and other episodes of sf may have occurred @xmath116 myr , @xmath117 gyr , @xmath118 and @xmath119 gyr ago .",
    "they also noted that the 100 myr isochrones was not as densely populated as the rest of the young ms , and concluded that the sfr in the wing is currently at lower levels compared to the recent past .",

    "the majority of the stars in the ums were formed likely between 300 and 500 myr ago , and few stars can be fitted with a @xmath3 myr old isochrone , in agreement with the @xcite conclusions that the wing was forming more stars in a recent past than now .",
    "sfh9 is in a more external region of the wing and is also the pointing in our survey most distant from the optical center of the smc ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the stellar density drops down to @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) in sfh9 .",
    "the majority of the stars in the sfh9 cmd are associated with the old and intermediate age stellar population , with ms , sgb , rgb and rc reasonably well defined .",
    "as done for the other fields , we have used the colors of the ums to constrain the reddening value , and obtained the best agreement with the observed data for @xmath100 .",
    "the older stellar population is composed of stars formed mainly between 4 and 10 gyr ago .",
    "the ums is very blue and , at all magnitudes , very tight , suggesting that nearly all these stars are younger than @xmath3 myr .",

    "@xcite noted a radial metallicity gradient that can explain the differences between the stellar populations found in sfh8 and the region observed by @xcite , who , observing a region @xmath143 from the center of the smc ( and @xmath144 from sfh8 ) , found evidence of progressive chemical enrichment with age from z=0.0008 to z=0.004    with the exception of the 14 objects bluer than @xmath145 , assuming a metallicity z=0.0004 , all the stars in the cmd are likely older than @xmath94 gyr , with the majority formed between 5 and 10 gyr .",

    "* ) . since , according to the padua isochrones , the bluest and brightest star ( @xmath146 ) in the ums has a mass of @xmath147 , while the msto of a 5 gyr old stellar population has a turn - off mass of 1.06 @xmath148 , the bss hypothesis is not inconceivable",
    ". we will test both hypotheses with the help of synthetic cmds in a forthcoming paper ( cignoni et al . in preparation ) .",
    "finally we note that the stellar populations in sfh8 clearly differ from those commonly observed in the halo of the mw , in the sense that the mw halo is dominated by stars older than 10 gyr , whereas only few such stars are in the smc halo .",
    "@xcite pointed out that several theoretical models fail to reproduce the upper rgb slope , a feature often used in broadband photometry to infer the metallicity of intermediate and old stellar populations , and the sgb morphology . to further characterize the properties of the old stellar component in the smc field , in figure  [ f : clusters ]",
    "we therefore superimposed to the cmds of the smc fields discussed in this paper , the ridgeline of three of the star clusters published by @xcite .",
    "we chose ngc  121 as a prototype of a very old ( @xmath149 gyr ) very metal poor ( z=0.0006 ) stellar population , kron  3 as representative of an old ( @xmath150 gyr ) metal poor ( z=0.001 ) one , and ngc  419 to represent a relatively young ( @xmath151 gyr ) chemically enriched ( z=0.004 ) stellar population .",
    "in all the observed fields the ngc  121 ridgeline ( red line in figure  [ f : clusters ] ) nicely reproduces the morphology of the lower sgb confirming the presence of an old ( age @xmath152 gyr ) and very metal poor stellar population in the smc .",
    "it also overlaps the narrow sequence of stars bluer than the main rgb .",
    "even if it is likely that this feature is dominated by low mass metal poor agb stars , some of these stars can be very metal poor ( z@xmath153 ) bright rgb stars .",
    "the ridgeline of ngc  419 ( blue line ) fits very well the redder component of the upper rgb in sfh1 , 4 , 5 , and 10 , confirming that both in the bar and the wing the metallicity was close to the present day smc metallicity already few gyr ago . in these four cmds",
    "only a few stars have colors and magnitude consistent with @xmath61 gyr old stellar population , further suggesting that star formation occurred at a lower rate than in the previous epochs .",

    "the smc is the closest dwarf galaxy with ongoing star formation , but until recently it has received less attention than the lmc .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , only a few groups have studied the sfh of its field stars , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our survey is designed to help fill this gap .",
    "the six fields we observed with the hst / acs sample smc regions characterized by very different star and gas densities , and , possibly , by different evolutionary histories . in all the six regions our photometry goes @xmath156 magnitudes below the oldest msto , allowing us to investigate in detail the properties of stars formed over the entire hubble time .",
    "our survey is currently the deepest and has the highest spatial resolution ever performed for the smc fields , and allows us to investigate even its densest regions , such as the bar .",
    "our data show that the smc was already forming stars @xmath0 gyr ago , yet we did not find a well - defined hb , i.e. the signature of an old and metal - poor stellar population , in any of our fields . on the other hand , a comparison with the ridgeline of smc star clusters shows that old ( @xmath0 gyr ) and metal - poor ( z@xmath153 ) stars are likely present in every field .",
    "these circumstances suggest that in the first few billion years the sf activity in the smc was low .",
    "this is also confirmed by the overall small number ( @xmath7 arcsec@xmath8 ) of rr - lyrae found in the smc bar @xcite .",
    "if fields and star clusters in the smc have similar sfhs , this can also explain why ngc  121 , the only globular cluster in the smc , is a couple of billion years younger than the globulars in the mw and lmc @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of a slow start of the sf activity is at odds with the conclusion by @xcite that the smc formed approximately 50% of all the stars more than 8.4 gyr ago , and only few stars between 3 and 8.4 gyr ago . on the other hand ,",
    "our result is consistent with that of @xcite , who did not find the hb in any of their 12 fields , and concluded that the smc formed very few stars at the beginning , experiencing an intense and prolonged sf activity between 1 and 6 gyr ago .",
    "@xcite also found that the sf activity in the field population presents periods of enhancement 0.3 - 0.4 , 3 - 4 and 6 gyr ago , and a likely quiescence at earlier epochs , as if early on , the tidal interactions between the clouds were not able to trigger any significant sf .",
    "a negligible sf activity at the earliest epochs was also found by @xcite in the ngc  602 region in the wing .",
    "future surveys devoted to identify all the variable stars in the smc ( i.e. with the eso survey telescopes vista , in the ir , and vst , in the optical bands ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) will provide a complete census of the rr - lyrae in the whole smc , thus allowing to fully trace the spatial distribution of oldest populations .",
    "this will also allow us to establish whether any of the stars in our fields is an rr - lyrae , and therefore belongs to the hb .    from our cmds",
    "we infer that the smc formed stars over a long interval of time until @xmath1 gyr ago . with the exception of the external field sfh8 ,",
    "intermediate - age stars show rather uniform characteristics , and a possible increase in the star forming activity approximately between 4 and 6 gyr ago , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also sfh8 shows evidence of prolonged star formation in the past , but the lower metallicity of this region suggests that sf might have occurred at a lower rate .    according to cold dark matter simulations",
    "hierarchical structures should form at all scales @xcite , therefore if the mcs formed outside the mw halo @xcite and now are at their first passage near the sun @xcite , they should be still surrounded by their own stellar halo . an extended dynamically hot stellar - like",
    "halo has been indeed found around the lmc @xcite , and stars that belong to the smc have been found up to @xmath27 kpc away from this galaxy .",

    "a systematic spectro - photometric analysis of the surroundings of the smc is needed not only to verify the existence of an extended halo , and characterize its properties , but also to provide new insights in the formation and evolution of the entire lg .",
    "we find that stars younger than 800 myr are concentrated in the bar and the wing of the smc . in the inner fields ( sfh1 , sfh4 , sfh5 and sfh10 )",
    ", we see an enhancement in the sf activity starting from approximately 500 myr ago , again in agreement with @xcite .",
    "stars younger than @xmath3 myr have a very inhomogeneous distribution , indicating that recent sf has locally developed .    within the uncertainties of our two - band photometry",
    ", we found evidence of radial chemical enrichment , with the most external regions ( the outskirts and the external wing ) characterized by lower metallicity than the central zones .",
    "this result is in agreement with that by @xcite and suggests that the sf activity was significantly lower in the periphery of the smc than in the center .",
    "a weak gradient of decreasing metallicities at larger distance has been also found in old and intermediate ",
