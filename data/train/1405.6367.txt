    "recently , researchers from the bicep2 collaboration announced the first direct evidence for the cosmic inflation @xcite .",
    "the inflation theory is introduced to solve lots of cosmological conundrums ( the monopole , horizon , flatness , and entropy problems ) in the standard cosmological model @xcite .",
    "inflationary models have has made huge success .",
    "in particular , it generates fluctuations that became the seeds for the growth of structures @xcite .",
    "inflation happens while the hubble parameter @xmath1 is approximately a constant , and @xmath2 . in this stage ,",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) parameter of inflationary field is @xmath3 which means the potential energy of inflationary field is dominant .",
    "this domination continues until @xmath4 , which indicates the kinetic energy can no longer be ignored .",
    "lots of evidences show that inflation is a brilliant candidate theory to explain the very early universe ( i.e. , see @xcite ) .",
    "but there are still some problems need to be solved , i.e. , the generating initial conditions for inflation , the singularity of the universe , and so on . as we know",
    ", if the universe is filled with radiation and matter , according to the general relativity theory , coming back in time , one concludes that there exists a primeval singularity , i.e. , big bang singularity .",
    "the big bang singularity problem could be viewed as a defect of einstein cosmology at high energies scale .    to solve the big bang singularity problem ,",
    "one possible solution is modifying the theory of general relativity at high energy scale .",
    "there are lots of candidates , one of which is lqc ( more recently review , please see @xcite ) .",
    "lqc is a canonical quantization of homogeneous spacetimes based upon the techniques used in loop quantum gravity ( lqg)@xcite . due to the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime ,",
    "the phase space of lqc is simpler than lqg , e.g. , the connection and triad are described by just two quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the dynamics of lqc can be studied effectively by introducing quantum gravity corrections to the gravity and matter hamiltonian @xcite , and the numerical evidence shows that the effective equations provide an excellent approximation to the full dynamics of sharply peaked states @xcite . in general ,",
    "two types of corrections are considered : inverse volume correction and holonomy correction . considering these modification",
    ", one can obtain many interesting results , e.g. , the replacement of big bang by big bounce @xcite , the avoidance of most singularities @xcite , the more likely occurrence of inflation@xcite , and so on .",
    "but the first modification suffers from gauge dependence which can not be cured and thus yields unphysical effects .",
    "therefore we will discuss the tachyonic inflation theory in lqc based on the second modification . in this effective lqc",
    ", a term of @xmath7 will be added to the right hands of the standard friedmann equation .",
    "since this correction comes with a negative sign , the hubble parameter @xmath1 , then @xmath8 will vanishes when @xmath9 , at which the quantum bounce occurs and the universe oscillates forever .",
    "since the friedmman equation adds a term of @xmath7 in effective lqc , the universe will enter a super inflation stage as soon as the quantum bounce happens , i.e. , @xmath9 . the super inflation is totally caused by the quantum geometry effect in lqc @xcite , and it has been studied by many papers @xcite .",
    "the generating initial conditions for inflation are far from easy in einstein cosmology , but there are lots of works argued that the phase of inflation is generic for the model with the holonomy corrections in lqc @xcite . the inflation theory in lqc has been discussed by many papers and the observational issues of lqc also have been studied ( for more recently review , please see @xcite ) .",

    "they found that there exists a super accelerated phase in the semiclassical region .",
    "the dynamical behaviors of non - interacting and interacting tachyon field are studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown there , the dynamical behavior of tachyon field is different from the one in einstein cosmology .",
    "the inflation theory of tachyon field in lqc also been discussed @xcite .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss how to get enough e - folding number of inflation in lqc , we will discuss the super inflation theory of tachyon field with exponential potential and inverse square potential in lqc , and the slow - roll inflation of tachyon field with exponential potential in lqc will be discussed , and we will show the enough e - folding number will be easier to get when one considers the super inflation and slow - roll inflation as a unitary inflation stage .    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we will introduce some basic equations of lqc and the tachyon field in section [ ii ] , and then , in section [ iii ] , we will show the tachyonic inflation in lqc . finally , we draw the conclusions in section in the last section . for simplicity ,",

    "we focus on the flat frw cosmology in this paper .",
    "the effective equations in lqc are derived from the lqc hamiltonian constraint operator and include the leading order quantum gravity corrections to the classical friedmann equation .",
    "it turns out that the effective equations provide a surprisingly good approximation to the dynamics of sharply peaked states in lqc at all times , including at the bounce point where quantum gravity effects are strongest @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the holonomy correction , then the modified friedmann equation reads @xmath12 in which @xmath13 is the critical energy density . for such model , energy density of matter can not exceed the critical energy density .",
    "we consider the universe is sourced by a tachyon field .",
    "the energy density and the pressure of tachyon field are @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the potential of tachyon field .",

    "this job has been shown in @xcite , but for completeness s sake , we briefly review the discussion of @xcite in the following . to make the discussion of slow - rolling inflation easy , we usually introduce a slow - rolling parameter @xmath30 which is related to the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the equation of state ( eos ) of tachyon field @xmath34 the expression of eos for tachyon field is only depends on its kinetic energy rather than its potential energy . but remember that the form of potential will effect the changing rate of kinetic energy , just as eq.([eom ] ) showed . according to eq.([omega ] ) , it easy to see @xmath35 $ ] .",
