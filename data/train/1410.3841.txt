    "intermediate - mass agb stars are also considered to be responsible for the chemical anomalies ( involving c , n , o , na , mg and al ) detected in all properly observed galactic globular clusters ( gcs ; see @xcite ) and in old magellanic cloud globulars @xcite .    due to their short lifetimes ( of the order of @xmath610 myr for a low - mass star with 0.8  @xmath5 )",
    ", the number of agb stars observable in an old gc is small , about a factor of 3 - 4 smaller than the number of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars of comparable luminosity .",
    "additionally , high - quality photometry and large color baselines are needed to properly separate genuine agb from rgb stars . hence , despite their luminosity , these objects are still not well investigated from the chemical point of view .",
    "accurate determinations of their atmospheric parameters and metallicity based on high - resolution spectroscopy are available for a few gcs only , namely m  4 @xcite , m  5 @xcite and 47 tucanae ( hereafter 47tuc , * ? ? ?",

    "particular care has been addressed to the different distribution of cn @xcite and na @xcite in agb and rgb stars , in light of the self - enrichment processes predicted to occur in the early stage of gc life ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "new interest for agb stars has been raised in a different research field from the observational results of @xcite , who found a significant excess ( @xmath7 ) and an anomalous segregation of such objects in the central regions of 47 tucanae ( see also @xcite for the case of m  2 ) .",
    "this finding suggests that the genuine agb population of this gc may be `` contaminated '' by a peculiar class of heavy intruders , namely the descendants of blue straggler stars spend their core hydrogen burning phase .",

    "feros allows to allocate simultaneously two fibers at a relative distance of @xmath11 , one on the source and the other on the sky .",
    "the targets have been selected from the photometric catalog of @xcite , within @xmath12 from the cluster center . in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of 47 tuc they are located in the agb clump ( corresponding to the beginning of this evolutionary phase ; @xcite ) , at @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see top panel of figure [ cmd ] ) .",
    "only isolated stars have been selected , in order to avoid contamination of the spectra from close objects of larger or comparable luminosity .",
    "the identification number , coordinates and magnitudes of each target are listed in table [ tab1 ] .    for each target a single exposure of @xmath630 - 40 min has been acquired , reaching signal - to - noise ratios s / n@xmath15 per pixel .",
    "the data reduction was performed by using the eso feros pipeline , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , wavelength calibration by using a th - ar - ne reference lamp , spectrum extraction and final merging and rebinning of the orders .",
    "since the background level of the sky is negligible ( @xmath16 ) compared to the brightness of the observed targets , we did not perform the sky subtraction from the final spectra in order to preserve its maximum quality .",
    "we accurately checked that the lack of sky subtraction has no impact on the derived abundances , by comparing the equivalent widths ( ews ) measured for some spectra with and without the sky subtraction .",
    "the radial velocity of each target has been obtained by means of the code daospec @xcite , measuring the positions of more than 300 metallic lines .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration has been checked by measuring telluric absorptions and oxygen sky lines , finding no significant zero - point offsets .",
    "uncertainties have been computed as the dispersion of the measured radial velocities divided by the square root of the number of used lines , and they turned out to be smaller than 0.04 km s@xmath17 .",

    "the model atmospheres have been computed by using the atlas9 code , under the assumption of plane - parallel geometry , local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and no overshooting in the computation of the convective flux .",
    "we adopted the last release of the opacity distribution functions from @xcite , assuming a global metallicity of [ m / h ] = @xmath22 dex with [ @xmath23/fe]@xmath24 dex for the model atmospheres .",
    "the effective temperatures ( @xmath25 ) and surface gravities ( @xmath26 ) of the targets have been derived photometrically , by projecting the position of each star in the cmd onto the isochrone best fitting the main evolutionary sequences of 47 tuc .",
    "the isochrone has been extracted from the basti database @xcite assuming an age of 12 gyr , metallicity z @xmath27 and @xmath23-enhanced chemical mixture .",

    "microturbulent velocities ( @xmath30 ) have been derived by requiring that no trends exist between fe i abundances and the reduced ews , defined as @xmath31 .",

    "moreover , we discarded from the analysis also the lines with ew uncertainties larger than @xmath42 , where the uncertainty of each individual line is provided by daospec on the basis of the fit residuals . with these limitations ,",
    "the iron abundance has been derived , on average , from @xmath43 fe i lines and @xmath44 fe ii lines . in the computation of the final iron abundances we adopted as reference solar value a(fe)@xmath45 = 7.50 dex @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on the derived abundances have been computed for each target by adding in quadrature the two main error sources : _ ( a ) _ those arising from the ew measurements , which have been estimated as the line - to - line abundance scatter divided by the square root of the number of lines used , and _",

    "the abundance variations thus obtained have been added in quadrature .",

    "since the atmospheric parameters have been estimated from photometry , by projecting the position of each target in the cmd onto the isochrone , we estimated term ( b ) from the photometric uncertainties . by assuming a conservative uncertainty of 0.1 mag for the magnitudes of our targets we obtained an uncertainty of about @xmath4650 k and @xmath460.05 dex on the final t@xmath47 and log  @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the total uncertainties in [ fe i / h ] are of the order of 0.04 - 0.05 dex , while in [ fe ii / h ] are of about 0.08 - 0.10 dex ( due to the higher sensitivity of fe ii lines to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",

    "hence very small ( if any ) adjustments , with a negligible impact on the derived abundances , can be admitted . instead , the values adopted for the surface gravity can have a significant impact on the difference between [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] .",
    "in fact , the abundances derived from fe ii lines are a factor of @xmath79 more sensitive to variations of @xmath26 with respect to those obtained from fe i lines : for instance , a variation of @xmath80 dex in @xmath26 leads to negligible variation ( @xmath81 dex ) in the fe i abundance , while [ fe ii / h ] decreases by 0.05 dex .",

    "similar results are obtained for all the other agb targets in our sample .",
    "small surface gravity values as those found from the fully spectroscopic analysis would require that stars reach the agb phase with an average mass of 0.4  @xmath5 ( keeping @xmath25 and luminosity fixed ) .",
    "this is lower than the value expected by considering a main sequence turnoff mass of 0.9  @xmath5 and a @xmath87 mass loss during the rgb phase @xcite .",
    "note that for some stars where [ fe i / h]@xmath54[fe ii / h]@xmath88 dex , the derived spectroscopic gravity would require a stellar mass of @xmath89 , which is even more unlikely for gc stars in this evolutionary stage , also by taking into account the mass loss rate uncertainties @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these values of @xmath26 can be obtained by assuming a significantly larger ( by about 0.5 mag ) distance modulus .",

    "the average difference between the @xmath25 values obtained from the isochrone and those derived from the @xcite relation is of 3 k ( @xmath64 = 50 k ) . for gravities we obtained an average difference of 0.05 dex ( @xmath64 = 0.03 dex ) and for the microturbulent velocities we found 0.01 km s@xmath17 ( @xmath64 = 0.04 km s@xmath17 ) .",

    "the authors performed different kinds of analysis , finding that the only way to reconcile the iron abundance in agb stars with the values obtained in rgb stars is to adopt the photometric gravities and rely on the fe ii lines only , which are essentially insensitive to lte departures .",
    "our findings , coupled with the results of @xcite in m  5 , suggest that the nlte effects could depend on the evolutionary stage ( being more evident in agb stars with respect to rgb stars ) , also at metallicities where these effects should be negligible ( like in the case of 47 tuc that is more metal - rich than m  5 ) .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , because a dependence of nlte effects on the evolutionary stage is not expected by the theoretical models .    in our sample ,",
    "we identify 4 agb stars ( namely # 100169 , # 100171 , # 200021 and # 200023 ) where the absolute difference between [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] is quite small ( less than @xmath106 dex ; see fig .",
    "[ fediff ] ) . according to the different behaviour observed between the agb and the rgb samples",
    ", one could suspect that these objects are rgb stars .",
    "however , we checked their position on the cmd also by using an independent photometry @xcite , confirming that these 4 targets are indeed genuine agb stars .",
    "[ spec ] compares two iron lines of the spectra of targets # 100171 and # 100174 , which are located in the same position of the cmd ( thus being characterized by the same atmospheric parameters ) , but have [ fe i / h]@xmath54[fe ii / h]@xmath107 and @xmath108 dex , respectively . clearly , the fe ii lines of the two stars have very similar depths , suggesting the same iron abundance , while the fe i line of # 100174 ( black spectrum ) is significantly shallower than that in the other star .",
    "this likely suggests that nlte effects among the agb stars have different magnitudes , the overionization being more or less pronounced depending on the star .",
    "the origin of this behaviour , as well as the unexpected occurrence of nlte effects in agb stars of these metallicity and atmospheric parameters , are not easy to interpret and their detailed investigation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "suitable theoretical models of the line formation under nlte conditions in agb stars should be computed in order to explain the observed difference in the fe i and fe ii abundances .",
    "we can not exclude that some inadequacies of the 1-dimensional model atmospheres can play a role in the derived results . up to now",
    ", 3-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of the convective effects in agb stars have been performed only for a typical agb star during the thermal pulses phase and with very low @xmath25 , @xmath62800 k @xcite .",
    "similar sophisticated models for earlier and warmer phases of the agb are urged .",
    "this result has a significant impact on the approach traditionally used for the chemical analysis of agb stars .",
    "in particular , two main aspects deserve specific care :    \\(1 ) the fe i lines should not be used to determine the iron abundance of agb stars .",
    "in fact , when photometric parameters are adopted , the [ fe i / h ] abundance ratio can be systematically lower than that obtained from fe ii lines . indeed , the most reliable route to derive the iron abundance in agb stars is to use the fe ii lines , that are essentially unaffected by nlte effects and provide the same abundances for both rgb and agb objects .",
    "this strategy requires high - resolution , high - quality spectra , because of the low number of fe ii lines available in the optical range ( smaller by a factor of @xmath109 with respect to the number of fe i lines ) .",
    "this is especially true at low metallicity since the lines are shallower and the nlte effects are expected to be stronger ;    \\(2 ) another point of caution is that agb stars must be analysed by adopting the photometric gravities ( derived from a theoretical isochrone or through the stefan - boltzmann equation ) and not by using the spectroscopic method of the ionization balance ( at variance with the case of rgb stars , where this approach is still valid ) .",
    "this method , which is widely adopted in the chemical analysis of optical stellar spectra , constrains @xmath26 by imposing the same abundance for given species as obtained from lines of two different ionization stages .",
    "variations of @xmath26 lead to variations in the abundances measured from ionized lines ( which are very sensitive to the electronic pressure ) , while the neutral lines are quite insensitive to these variations .",
    "because of the systematically lower fe i abundance , this procedure leads to improbably low surface gravities in agb stars ( as demonstrated in section  [ check ] ) .    if the fe i line are used as main diagnostic of the iron abundance , a",
    "analysis , where agb and rgb stars are not analysed separately , can lead to a spurious detection of large iron spreads in gcs .",
    "in light of these considerations , the use of fe ii lines is recommended to determine the metallicity of agb objects , regardless of their metallicity and luminosity . on the other hand ,",
    "the systematic difference between fe i abundances in agb and rgb stars could , in principle , be used to recognize agb stars when reliable photometric selections can not be performed .",
    "the discovery of such an unexpected nlte effect in agb stars might help to identify possible e - bsss among agb stars .",
    "in fact , bsss spend their rgb phase in a region of the cmd which is superimposed to that of the cluster agb ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , e - bsss are indistinguishable from genuine agb stars in terms of colors and magnitudes , but they have larger masses at comparable radii .",
    "hence , their surface gravity is also expected to be larger ( by about 0.2 - 0.3 dex ) than that of `` canonical '' agb stars of similar temperature and luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , the spectroscopic measurement of @xmath26 can not be used to distinguish between genuine agb stars and e - bsss , since the ionization balance method can not be applied in the presence of the nlte effects affecting the agb ( see sect .",
    "[ tradit ] ) .",
    "however , because of the seemingly dependence of the nlte effects on the evolutionary phase , the measurement of different values of [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] should allow to recognize genuine agb stars from e - bsss evolving along their rgb within a sample of objects observed in the agb clump of a gc .",
    "of course , this expectation holds only if the lack of nlte effects found for low - mass ( @xmath110 ) rgb stars also holds for larger masses ( @xmath111 ) , typical of e - bsss in gcs . in order to check this hypothesis",
    ", we retrieved from the eso archive flames - uves spectra for 7 giant stars in the open cluster berkeley 32 ( i d program : 074.d-0571 ) .",
    "this cluster has an age of @xmath66 - 7 gyr @xcite , corresponding to a turnoff mass of @xmath112 , comparable with the typical masses of the bsss observed in galactic gcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we analyzed the spectra following the same procedure used for the agb stars in 47 tuc .",
    "the derived abundances are [ fe i / h]@xmath113 dex ( @xmath64 = 0.04 dex ) and [ fe ii / h]@xmath114 dex ( @xmath64 = 0.06 dex ) , in nice agreement with the results of @xcite based on the same dataset .",
    "the small difference between the abundances from fe i and fe ii lines confirms the evidence arising from the rgb sample of 47 tuc : in metal - rich rgb stars no sign of overionization is found , also for stellar masses larger than those typical of galactic gc stars .    within this framework",
    ", we checked whether some e - bsss could be hidden in the analysed sample of putative agb stars , especially among the four objects with negligible difference between fe i and fe ii abundances . to this end",
    "we derived new atmospheric parameters for all targets projecting their position in the cmd on a grid of evolutionary basti tracks crossing the mean locus of the studied stars : these are the rgb tracks for stellar masses of 1.2 , 1.3 and 1.4  @xmath5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on average ,",
    "the new values of @xmath25 are slightly larger than those obtained in section [ chem ] , while gravities are systematically larger , by up to @xmath60.3 dex . for increasing mass of the adopted track",
    ", the general behaviour is that [ fe i / h ] slightly increases ( mainly because of a small increase of @xmath25 ) , while [ fe ii / h ] decreases ( because of the combined growth of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , none of the measured agb stars show [ fe i / h]@xmath6[fe ii / h]@xmath6[fe / h]@xmath115 with the new sets of parameters .",
    "this suggests that no e - bsss are hidden within our observed agb sample .",
    "in particular , we found that for the four agb stars with no evidence of overionization , the [ fe ii / h ] abundance ratios derived with the new parameters are larger than those obtained from [ fe i / h ] ( due to the increase in @xmath26 ) and for rgb stars .",
    "this indicates that the atmospheric parameters estimated from the agb portion of the isochrone are the most appropriate and these four objects are indeed genuine agb stars .",
    "as an additional check , we measured the iron abundances assuming atmospheric parameters from theoretical tracks of massive ( 1 - 2  @xmath5 ) agb stars .",
    "in this case , the situation improves . in particular , by using an agb track of 1.2  @xmath5 , because of the combined effect of larger @xmath25 ( @xmath6 + 100 k ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath6 + 0.2 ) , we find average values of [ fe i / h]@xmath116 dex and [ fe ii / h]@xmath117 dex .",
    "however , this scenario is unlikely because the probability to detect an e - bss during its agb phase is a factor of @xmath109 lower than the probability to observe it during the rgb phase ( consistently with the time duration of these evolutionary phases ) .    as a general rule ,",
    "however , we stress that , the dependence of nlte effects on the evolutionary stage ( if confirmed ) can be used as a diagnostic of the real nature of the observed agb stars and to identify e - bsss hidden in a putatively genuine agb sample .",
    "we have measured the iron abundance of 24 agb stars members of the gc 47 tuc , by using high - resolution feros spectra . by adopting photometric estimates of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , we derived average iron abundances [ fe i / h]@xmath0 dex ( @xmath64 = 0.08 dex ) and [ fe ii / h]@xmath2 dex ( @xmath64 = 0.05 dex ) .",
    "thus , while the abundance estimated from ionized lines ( @xmath118 dex ) well matches the one obtained for rgb stars , the values measured from neutral lines appear to be systematically lower .",
    "we carefully checked all the steps of our chemical analysis procedure and the adopted atmospheric parameters , finding no ways to alleviate this discrepancy .",
    "such a difference is compatible with the occurrence of nlte effects driven by iron overionization , confirming the previous claim by @xcite for a sample of agb stars in m  5 .",
    "our findings suggest that @xmath119 the departures from the lte approximation can be more significant than previously thought , even at relatively high metallicities ( [ fe / h]@xmath120 ) and for stars much fainter than the rgb - tip , @xmath121 iron overionization can be more or less pronounced depending on the star ( in fact , four stars in our sample turn out to be unaffected ) , and @xmath122 these effects depend on the evolutionary stage ( they are not observed among rgb stars ) .",
    "we discussed the impacts of this effect on the traditional chemical analysis of agb stars : if fe i lines are used and/or surface gravities are derived from the ionization balance , artificial under - estimates and/or spreads of the iron abundances can be obtained .",
    "if the dependence of these nlte effects on the evolutionary stage is confirmed , the systematic difference between [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] abundance ratios can , in principle , be used to identify e - bsss within a sample of genuine agb stars ( these two populations sharing the same locus in the cmd ) .    from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "new and accurate models are needed to account for these findings , in particular to explain the dependence on the evolutionary stage .",
    "observationally , further analyses of high - resolution spectra of agb stars are crucial and urged to firmly establish the occurrence of these effects and to investigate their behaviour as a function of other parameters , like the cluster metallicity , the stellar mass and the stellar luminosity .",
