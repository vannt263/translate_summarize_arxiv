    "the field of electronic transport through metallic and semi - conducting quantum dots has been a topic of intense research for over a decade . while in the early experiments the main focus was on charging effects leading to the phenomenon known as ` coulomb blockade',@xcite and later on the kondo effect in single quantum dots,@xcite in recent years the attention has shifted to more elaborate systems such as double quantum dot systems.@xcite in addition , the study of the electronic spectrum of quantum dots ( excited states ) was possible as the physical size of quantum dots",
    "could be further reduced by improved lithographical methods as well as the rise of new materials such as nanotubes and semi - conducting nanowires.@xcite    already in the 90s , there were experiments@xcite on single quantum dots displaying non - monotonous current - voltage characteristics , for which the current decreases with increasing bias , leading to a negative differential conductance ( ndc ) . within the orthodox theory of sequential tunneling ,",
    "such effects were explained by the presence of excited states which were more weakly coupled to the leads than the ground states ( for a given charge on the dot ) .",
    "the reason for a state dependent coupling could be either due to spin ( clebsch - gordon coefficients)@xcite or the different orbital wave - functions of the various states.@xcite a bias voltage dependence of the lead - dot tunnel coupling can lead to a weak ndc effect , see , e.g. , ref .  .    for a double quantum dot",

    "as the quantum levels in the different dots are shifted differently by the applied bias voltage ( depending on the various capacitances of the system ) the alignment condition is fulfilled at certain small ranges of the bias voltage , leading to the current peaks .    in this paper",
    "we focus on quantum transport through a dqd .",
    "this system offers the possibility to study the interplay between the coherent quantum mechanical oscillation inside the dqd and the influence of the coupling to leads .",
    "especially , we are interested in the negative differential conductance caused by this interplay ( rather than the well - known sources discussed above ) . in the regime where the inter - dot tunneling coupling dominates over the coupling to leads , it was found in ref .   that ndc only occurs if the spatial symmetry of the system is broken , e.g. due to asymmetric coupling to leads or detuning of the bare level energies . in another recent paper , b. wunsch _ et al . _",
    "[ ] investigated the transport in the opposite limit , where the inter - dot coupling is weak and with a small detuning of the bare level energies , i.e. for an asymmetric system .",
    "they found that ndc can be caused by a level renormalization due to the coupling to leads .",
    "also in the weak inter - dot coupling regime , djuric _",
    "[ ] found ndc even for symmetric systems for certain ratios between the inter - dot tunneling coupling and the coupling to leads .",
    "the effect was explained in terms of decoherence due to the coupling to leads , which depended on the occupation of the dot . in this article",
    "we show how these effects relate to each other .    in the above mentioned works , the current was only calculated to lowest ( first ) order in the lead - dot tunnel coupling , so strictly speaking , the results are only valid in the sequential tunneling limit . however , for the issues addressed above , the coupling to the contacts strongly influences not only the occupations but also affects the nature of the transport , especially its quantum - mechanical coherence .",
    "thus it is not a priori clear , if the first - order approach is appropriate , even if the temperature is higher than the energy scale ( line - width ) due to the coupling to the leads .",
    "below , we investigate the current to higher order in the lead - dot coupling by applying the method described in ref .   and compare with first order results . for both cases",
    "we find qualitative agreement if the temperature is higher or comparable to the line - width due to coupling to the leads , but we also discuss the behavior for lower temperatures , where the first order approach becomes unreliable .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we present in detail the dqd model system we consider .",
    "section [ sec : approach ] discusses in brief the transport models we are using to obtain the transport results ( details are presented in the appendix ) .",
    "the potential sources of ndc behavior are discussed in detail in section [ sec : ndc_sources ] .",
    "finally we summarize our findings in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider a double quantum dot system , where the spin degree of freedom has been omitted in order to simplify the analysis ( in subsection [ sec : doublespin ] the double spin case is briefly addressed ) . in a single - particle basis",
    "the hamiltonian for the system reads @xmath1 where the first line describes the isolated quantum dot system with @xmath2 being the coulomb energy for occupying both dots , @xmath0 the inter - dot tunneling coupling and with @xmath3 denoting the left / right dot . the first term in the second line accounts for the leads with index @xmath4 for the left / right lead and levels counted by @xmath5 .",

    "current through the dqd is effectively blocked if no one - particle excitation lies in the bias window between the fermi levels of both contacts .",
    "this is known as the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "therefore , as the bias is increased , a current can flow through the structure whenever a one - particle excitation becomes energetically allowed , leading to a step feature in the current and a corresponding peak in the differential conductance .",
    "having 4 such possible excitations ( @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ) , at most four steps can be observed in the @xmath26-curve .",
    "further steps can be seen , if spin is considered as well.@xcite    the quantum rate equations from refs .   are valid in the high - bias limit , i.e. if the energy difference between the chemical potentials in the contacts and the excitations exceeds both the level broadenings @xmath27 and the temperature .",
    "if only one - particle states are within the bias window , but double occupation is forbidden , i.e. , @xmath28 , these equations provide the plateau current @xmath29 if , in contrast , all excitations are within the bias window , one obtains @xmath30 these values will be compared to our calculations in the subsequent sections .",
    "our calculations are based on the von neumann equation for the density matrix , as described in detail in ref .  .",

    "the full correlations of up to two particles entering and leaving the system was taken into account and this approach will be referred to as the _ second order von neumann approach _ ( 2vn ) in the following .",

    "the 1vn approach neglects level broadening effects ( of order @xmath40 ) and is thus expected to be valid only for @xmath41 or in the high - bias limit .",
    "in contrast , the 2vn approach is able to reproduce such effects and gives good results above the kondo temperature.@xcite due to the self - consistency , the 2vn approach contains in addition to two - particle correlations also a subset of higher order correlations . in app .",

    "in a real experimental double - dot structure , the applied source - drain bias @xmath14 does not only determine the electrochemical potentials in the leads , but it will also shift the dot level energies by polarization .",

    "the `` molecular '' bonding and anti - bonding states provide an appropriate description of the single - electron states of the dqd ( see also the comparison in app .

    "correspondlingly , the anti - bonding state has more weight on the left dot ( interface to the emitter electrode ) .",
    "this asymmetry in the wave functions leads to an effective asymmetry of coupling of these states to the leads , e.g. for positive @xmath51 , the anti - bonding state is strongly coupled to the emitter , whereas the bonding state is strongly coupled to the collector lead .",
    "the eigenenergies @xmath93 of the bonding and anti - bonding state are given by @xmath94 ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) . as @xmath95 is the only state with negative energy , it is the overall ground state of the dqd .",
    "this means that in equilibrium ( zero bias ) the bonding state is mainly occupied , whereas all other states have only small occupation probability .",
    "the first current step appears at a bias @xmath96 when the dqd can be emptied . at the same bias",
    "the anti - bonding state can be occupied by tunneling of an electron from the emitter into the empty dqd .",
    "because of the coupling asymmetry , above a bias @xmath97 there is a large change in the average occupation of the dqd states : the bonding state is strongly depleted due to the good coupling to the collector lead , whereas the anti - bonding state is now favorably filled by electrons tunneling into the dqd from the emitter lead .",
    "thus , on the first plateau the dqd is most of the time in the anti - bonding state .    as the bias",
