    "a @xmath1-matrix is _ balanced _ if the sum of the entries of every submatrix that is minimal with respect to the property of containing @xmath2 nonzero entries per row and per column , is congruent to @xmath3 .",
    "balanced matrices were introduced by berge  @xcite in the context of hypergraphs , and they arise naturally in linear programming  @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable study of balanced matrices ; the reader might check  @xcite or  @xcite for a survey on the main results and horizons on balanced matrices .",
    "every @xmath1-matrix is also the bipartite adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph . specifically , if @xmath4 is a bipartite graph with vertex bipartition @xmath5 , then the bipartite adjacency matrix for @xmath4 is the @xmath1-matrix @xmath6 with @xmath7 if and only if @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "so , it is natural to consider which bipartite graphs have balanced adjacency matrices .",
    "equivalently , which bipartite graphs have no induced circuits of length @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to such graphs as _",
    "balanced graphs_. most results on balanced graphs are restricted to some subclass .",
    "for instance , balanced graphs in which every induced circuit has length @xmath10 have been characterised in  @xcite .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to provide some insight into the structure of some additional classes of balanced graphs .",
    "all graphs in this paper are connected , so , by abuse of terminology we use the term `` graph '' to mean `` connected graph ''",
    ".    we will present three main results in this paper , together with a number of conjectures . in two of our results ,",
    "we restrict our attention to a significant family of balanced graphs , and characterise all of the graphs in that family .",
    "first , we characterise balanced cayley graphs on abelian groups .",
    "then we prove that there are no cubic balanced planar graphs . in the remaining result , we provide a condition on the number of vertices of a @xmath11-regular balanced graph .",
    "before we can state our characterisation of balanced cayley graphs on abelian groups , a number of definitions will be required .",
    "let @xmath12 be a group and @xmath13 a subset of @xmath12 such that @xmath13 is closed under taking inverses , i.e. @xmath14 . the _ cayley graph _ of @xmath12 with connection set @xmath13 , denoted @xmath15 , is the graph with vertex set @xmath12 and edge set @xmath16 . if @xmath4 and @xmath17 are graphs , the lexicographic product of @xmath4 with @xmath17 is the graph with vertices @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are adjacent if and",
    "only if either @xmath21 , or @xmath22 and @xmath23 . we denote by @xmath24 the complement of the complete graph @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath24 has @xmath26 vertices and no edges .",
    "further , we denote by @xmath27 the cycle of length @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the degenerate case",
    ". the following terminology will be used in our characterisation .",
    "let @xmath30 be in @xmath31 , with @xmath32 or @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the lexicographic product of @xmath27 with @xmath24 is called an _ @xmath35-cycle_.    ( 0,0)-cycle , title=\"fig : \" ]    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    ( 4486,4516)(818,-4044 )    figure  [ f : cycle ] shows the example of an @xmath36-cycle .",
    "we recall that the circuits of a cayley graph @xmath4 are well studied and the problem of `` understanding '' the lengths of the circuits of @xmath4 has attracted considerable attention , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that if @xmath4 is a bipartite cayley graph on an abelian group , then @xmath4 has circuits of any even length , i.e. @xmath37 , see  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , not much is known about the _ induced _ circuits of @xmath4 .",
    "so , in this paper , we focus only on induced circuits . since it seems hard to get general results on induced circuits of cayley graphs , we restrict our interest to balanced cayley graphs . specifically , in section  [ s : circulant ] and section  [ s : abelian ] , we study balanced cayley graphs on abelian groups",
    ". we will show that this class of graphs is very restricted .",
    "indeed , we get the following result .    [",
    "t : mainabelian ] if @xmath12 is an abelian group and @xmath38 , then the graph @xmath15 is balanced if and only if it is isomorphic to an @xmath35-cycle .    in section  [ s : divisibility ]",
    ", we use a theorem of berge  @xcite and fulkerson , hoffman , and oppenheim  @xcite to prove the following result .",
    "[ t : divisibility ] if @xmath4 is a @xmath11-regular balanced graph , then the number of vertices of @xmath4 is divisible by @xmath39 .    in section  [ sec : planar ] , we narrow our focus to cubic balanced planar graphs and we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ noplanar ] there is no cubic balanced planar graph .",
    "finally , two conjectures for balanced regular graphs are presented in section  [ s : conjectures ] .",
    "these conjectures are based on the results for balanced cayley graphs on abelian groups , on theorem  [ noplanar ] and on some exhaustive computer computations .",
    "it seems to the authors that the statements and the proofs in section  [ s : circulant ] and  [ s : abelian ] are neater using a multiplicative notation .",
    "so , all groups in the following two sections will be written using multiplicative notation . as usual ,",
    "if @xmath12 is a group and @xmath40 , the symbol @xmath41 denotes the subgroup of @xmath12 generated by @xmath42 , and @xmath43 denotes the identity element in @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath44 denote a cyclic group of order @xmath45 , generated by @xmath42 , and let @xmath46 be closed under taking inverses .",
    "the graph @xmath47 is said to be a _ circulant graph _ of order @xmath45 . recall that @xmath47 is bipartite if and only if @xmath45 is even and @xmath48 .      proof .",
    "we prove , by induction on @xmath28 , that @xmath52 lies in @xmath13 for every @xmath28 . if @xmath53 or @xmath54 , then there is nothing to prove , by hypothesis @xmath55 lie in @xmath13 .",
    "now , assume that the claim is true for every index @xmath56 such that @xmath57 , and so , @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath14 , if @xmath59 , then @xmath60 and there is nothing to prove .",
    "assume @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 and let @xmath63 be minimum with @xmath64 .",
    "set @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are non - negative integers with @xmath68 .",
    "we show that @xmath69 and @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 .",
    "note that since @xmath72 , we may assume that @xmath73 .",
    "suppose instead that @xmath74 .",
    "the following table lists the vertices of an induced circuit @xmath75 in @xmath4 with length @xmath76 . in reading the table",
    ", the following remarks may be useful . since @xmath26 is even and @xmath77 is odd",
    ", @xmath66 and @xmath67 have the same parity .",
    "each cycle ends with the vertex @xmath78 .",
    "now , we leave to the reader the straightforward work of checking that every given circuit is induced , since all differences between non - consecutive vertices are either even , or strictly between @xmath77 and @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath4 is balanced , it follows that @xmath69 .",
