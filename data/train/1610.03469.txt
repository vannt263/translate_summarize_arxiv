    "black hole x - ray binary ( bhxrb ) systems in outburst regularly show quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in their x - ray flux across a wide range of frequencies : finite - width peaks in their power spectra on top of broad band noise ( bbn ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "bhxrbs show a large variety of qpos , from low - frequency ( lf ) qpos with a frequency up to @xmath2 hz to high - frequency ( hf ) qpos with frequencies up to a few hundred hz . based on differences in , for instance , power spectral properties ( such as centroid frequency , width and amplitude ) and phase lag behaviour , lfqpos can be classified into three categories : type - a , b and c @xcite . as",
    "type - b and type - c lfqpos possess different properties , and have been observed simultanously in gro j165540 @xcite , they are expected to originate from a different physical process .",
    "type - a qpos are rarely observed , and poorly understood .",
    "hfqpos are less prevalent than lfqpos @xcite ; in this paper , we consider only lfqpos and will hence denote them simply as qpos .    despite various models ,",
    "no definitive consensus about the origin of qpos has been reached .",
    "this origin could either be _ geometric _ , where for instance lense - thirring precession of the inner accretrion flow causes the observed oscillations in the x - ray flux @xcite , or _",
    "intrinsic _ , where the x - ray luminosity itself is intrinsically varying .",
    "the latter could for example result from accretion rate fluctuations @xcite or standing shocks in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "a promising method to distinguish between these possible models is to search for relations between qpo properties and binary orbit inclination : @xcite show that such dependencies would favor a geometric origin .",
    "recently , both @xcite and @xcite have reported such an inclination dependence of qpo properties , using two completely different approaches .",
    "@xcite find that the type - c qpo shows a systematically larger absolute variability amplitude in edge - on sources , consistent with lense - thirring precession as its origin .",
    "the type - b qpo displays the opposite effect , having a systematically larger absolute amplitude in face - on sources , which is most consistent with an origin related to the jet .",
    "these results also support the hypothesis that these types of qpos arise from different , but both geometric , mechanisms . due to a small number of observations , no inclination dependence of type - a qpos has been detected .",
    "secondly , @xcite show that the influence of the qpo on the bhxrb s power - colour properties is inclination dependent , implying that also the relative qpo amplitude compared to the bbn depends on inclination .",
    "other evidence in support of a geometric qpo origin has also been reported recently . using phase - resolved spectroscopy of the type - c qpo in grs 1915 + 105 , @xcite detect a modulation of the reflected iron line equivalent width , consistent with a lense - thirring precession model and similar earlier findings by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite also detect a modulation of the iron line centroid energy in h1743 - 322 using the same method .",
    "moreover , we found that the phase lag between the hard and soft band at the type - c qpo frequency in grs 1915 + 105 systematically evolves on timescales of a few seconds @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the result of differential precession of the inner accretion flow @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite apply phase - resolved spectroscopy on the type - b qpo in gx 339 - 4 and report quasi - periodic variation in the blackbody and power - law spectral components .",
    "this is interpreted as evidence for a jet - base origin of the type - b qpo .",
    "finally , @xcite show that the qpo in the neutron - star x - ray binary exo 0748 - 676 can be explained by the precession of a misaligned inner accretion flow . given this existing observational evidence for a geometric qpo origin for both type - b and type - c",
    ", we can expect to find more inclination dependent qpo properties .",
    "since different regions in the accretion flow dominate different parts of the observed bhxrb x - ray spectrum @xcite , the inclination dependence of energy - dependent qpo properties could provide new insights into the origin of type - b and type - c qpos .",
    "one such property is the phase lag at different fourier frequencies , in particular the qpo fundamental and ( sub)harmonic , or frequencies dominated by the bbn .",
    "the different types of qpos are known to show different phase lag behaviour at the qpo fundamental and ( sub)harmonic @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relation between qpo frequency and qpo phase lag differs between sources ( see e.g. figure 4 in @xcite and figure 3 in @xcite ) - most noteworthy is the apparently log - linear dependence of qpo phase lags on qpo frequency in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "these known results make phase lags an interesting qpo property to compare between sources of different inclination .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting to consider the inclination dependence of differences in the type - c qpo centroid frequency in different energy bands .",
    "such frequency differences have been reported in grs 1915 + 105 @xcite , xte j1550 - 564 @xcite and h1743 - 322 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the observed differences in qpo centroid frequency in grs 1915 + 105 correspond to a systematic evolution of phase lags while the qpo decoheres on timescales of seconds .",
    "this is interpreted as a possible signature of differential lense - thirring precession in the inner accretion flow .",
    "as this interpretation proposes a geometric toy model , we also investigate the inclination dependence of the observed frequency differences in this paper .    in this paper , we present a systematic , model - independent analysis of the inclination dependence of phase lags using archival rxte observations of fifteen bhxrbs .",
    "we determine these phase lags at various fourier frequencies : the qpo fundamental , ( sub)harmonics , and a range dominated by the broad band noise ( bbn ) .",
    "we also measure the difference in type - c qpo frequency between energy bands for all sources and investigate the inclination dependence of this frequency difference .",
    "we find that the phase lags show a clear dependence on inclination for the type - c qpo fundamental and bbn .",
    "furthermore , we find significant qpo frequency differences in four sources , none of which are consistent with a low inclination .",
    "lastly , our results indicate that xte j1859 + 226 and maxi j1543 - 564 , both sources of undetermined inclination , are consistent with a high inclination .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we present the source sample , the set of analysed rxte observations , and our analysis method . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our results on both phase lags and frequency differences , which are subsequently discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and future outlook in section 5 .",
    "to compare qpo and bbn phase lag properties between black hole binaries of different inclinations , we analyse archival rxte observations of 15 galactic bhxrbs : the fourteen sources analysed in @xcite and grs 1915 + 105 . for all sources except grs 1915 + 105 , we analyse a selection of observations based on the samples in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we apply the same classification of sources into high ( _ more edge - on binary orbit _ ) , low ( _ more face - on binary orbit _ ) and undetermined inclination , and of qpo observations into type - b and type - c , as @xcite .",
    "the sample includes all sources analysed by @xcite except for xte j1118 + 480 , gs 1354 - 64 and xte j1720 - 318 , since as these sources were not analysed by @xcite , no extensive overview of qpo observations is available .",
    "the classification of inclinations as low or high is consistent between @xcite and @xcite , except for xte j1817 - 330 : this source is treated as low inclination in the former , but as undetermined in the latter .    as stated , we adopt the inclination classifications as applied in @xcite . for ten sources , a direct inclination estimate or an upper / lower limit on inclination is available .",
    "references for these estimates are listed in table [ tab : sources ] . besides direct estimates ,",
    "the inclination classification is mostly based on the presence of lightcurve dips , observed in all sources identified as high inclination except grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "additional constraints are provided by the source s tracks in their colour - luminosity diagram , as investigated by @xcite , and the observation of winds in high inclination sources . for more background on this inclination classification , we refer the reader to the extensive discussion in the main text and second appendix in @xcite .    the classification into low and high inclination sources is based on estimates of binary - orbit inclination . however , both type - b and type - c qpos are thought to originate from the innermost accretion flow , which can be misaligned with the binary orbit .",
    "hence , we adopt a broad classification , only identifying a source as either low or high inclination , instead of applying the precise estimates listed in table [ tab : sources ] . in section [ sec :",
    "disc ] , we will discuss the effect of possible inner - disk misalignments and different inclination estimates in more detail .    for grs 1915 + 105",
    ", we consider the same observations as @xcite , which are specifically selected on type - c qpos spanning a range in frequency from @xmath3 to @xmath4 hz .",
    "no accurate estimates of the binary orbit inclination exist for this system .",
    "however , its relativistic jet has an inclination of @xmath5 @xcite . assuming that any misalignment between the jet and the binary orbit axis is small , we thus classify grs 1915 + 105 as a high inclination system . in table [ tab : sources ] , we list our complete sample , including inclination estimates and classifications , and number of type - b and type - c qpo observations . in appendix b , we list all analysed observations with corresponding qpo frequency and measured phase lag .",
    "a small fraction of the observations in @xcite are not analysed in this work , for several reasons . in some cases ,",
    "the qpo possesses a negligible rms amplitude at either the soft or hard energies .",
    "alternatively , for some observations , the short exposure results in an inaccurate estimate of phase lags . in both cases",
    ", this leads to barely constrained phase lag values around the qpo fundamental and especially ( sub)harmonic frequencies . in a minority of cases",
    ", we were unable to identify the qpo in the considered observation due to it possessing a low amplitude in all energy bands .",
    "in all three cases , we disregard these observations from our sample .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      despite apparent differences in figure [ fig : others ] , the type - b fundamental phase lags do not show a dependence on source inclination at a @xmath6 confidence level .",
    "furthermore , these lags show a different dependence on qpo frequency than the type - c lags .",
    "this adds to the evidence that the type - b qpo arises from a different mechanism , @xcite , such as the precessing base of a jet @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that the data quality for the type - b qpos is less than for the type - c qpos : the uncertainties are larger and the number of observations and sources is smaller .",
    "if the type - b qpo indeed originates from a jet - based mechanism , an inclination dependence in the phase lags might be expected .",
    "it is possible that the data quality in our analysis is simply too low to significantly detect such a dependence .",
    "the soft lags we observe in several high inclination sources are not expected based on the type - b qpo classification as defined by @xcite and @xcite , which describes only hard lags in type - b qpos .",
    "we observe these unexpected lags in xte j1550 - 564 , h1743 - 322 , 4u 1630 - 47 and maxi j1659 - 152 . from these sources , only xte j1550 - 564 was included in the analysis of the original definition of qpo types . however , our sample of type - b observations in xte j1550 - 564 is more extensive than the original sample .",
    "furthermore , @xcite define the fundamental qpo as the @xmath7 hz peak , while we define this as the subharmonic .",
    "thus , it appears to be too simple to state that all type - b qpo fundamentals have hard lags . based on our results",
    ", these lags could be both hard and soft .",
    "the phase lags of the bbn associated with the type - c qpo ( in the @xmath8@xmath9 hz range ) show a significant inclination dependence at the 99% confidence level , while those associated with the type - b qpo do not . in both cases ,",
    "the soft lags appear to be dominated by the high inclination sources . for type - b qpo observations ,",
    "marginally hard lags are seen in low inclination sources . for type - c qpo observations",
    "however , hard lags are observed in both high and low inclination sources .",
    "for both the type - b and type - c observations , the bbn lag does not show any clear dependence on the qpo frequency ( as is clearly present in for instance the type - c qpo lag ) .",
    "existing results on the inclination dependence of the bbn are not in full agreement : @xcite find that the bbn , unlike the qpo , does not show a dependence on inclination .",
    "@xcite however show that the amplitude of the bbn associated with the type - c qpo does depend on inclination . in comparing these results with ours",
    "it is important to note that @xcite analyse observations regardless of the presence of the qpo .",
    "our results on the other hand are derived from observations selected on qpo type .",
    "the bias introduced by this selection might partially explain the inclination dependence observed for the type - c bbn : if the physical origin of the qpo and bbn are related , the presence of a qpo might result in inclination dependent properties in the bbn .",
    "alternatively , the bbn lags might simply be contaminated by qpo lags , despite our cut on qpo and subharmonic frequency .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath8@xmath9 hz range is quite arbitrary , chosen merely for its relatively large bbn amplitude .",
    "thus , we have repeated the analysis on the bbn lags averaged over the range @xmath10@xmath8 hz in the same observations ( i.e. those with no qpo or subharmonic below @xmath11 hz ) .",
    "as this range covers lower frequencies , possible contamination by the qpo lags is less likely . in this new range ,",
    "no significant inclination dependence is present in both qpo types ( type - c : @xmath12 , type - b : @xmath13 ) , despite similar data quality .",
    "thus , as the inclination dependence of type - c bbn lags between @xmath8@xmath9 hz appears to be closely related to the arbitrary frequency range , we do not draw general conclusions about the nature of the bbn associated with type - c qpos .      in our analysis",
    ", we have grouped sources into high , low or undetermined inclination and assumed that any significant differences in lag behaviour originate from differences in inclination . in this section",
    ", we will discuss two sets of individual sources : sources of undetermined inclination ( xte j1859 + 226 and maxi j1543 - 564 ) and sources that do not follow the standard trend in type - c fundamental lags as function qpo frequency ( gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 ) .      for both xte j1859 + 226 and maxi j1543 - 564 , no definite classification into low or high inclination could be determined .",
    "thus , both sources where excluded from the comparison between the high and low inclination samples . in figure [ fig : unknown ] , we plot the type - c qpo phase lag as a function of qpo frequency for these two sources .",
    "xte j1859 + 226 clearly follows the same trend as the high inclination sources . due to the small number of observations and larger uncertainties , the maxi j1543 - 564 lags are less evident",
    "however , the lags are clearly soft , consistent with the high inclination sample . based on the qpo and noise amplitudes",
    ", @xcite also found that xte j1859 + 226 and maxi j1543 - 564 are most consistent with a high inclination .",
    "the clear presence of qpo frequency differences in xte j1859 + 226 ( figure [ fig : df_inc ] ) , previously only found in three high inclination sources , reinforces the interpretation that xte j1859 + 226 is indeed a high inclination source .",
    "the high - inclination source gro j1655 - 40 does not seem to show any significantly non - zero phase lags at the type - c qpo frequency . to demonstrate this",
    ", we plot these phase lags versus qpo frequency , together with all other high inclination sources in grey , in figure [ fig : groj1655 ] ; gro j1655 - 40 s behaviour is clearly distinct from the other sources above approximately @xmath14 hz . however , we emphasize that the reported inclination dependence remains significant despite the presence of gro j1655 - 40 in our high inclination sample . despite this note , and given the remarkable timing properties of this source in general , it is interesting to discuss the possible origin of its distinct lag behaviour .    recently , @xcite reported the detection of a _ hypersoft _ state in gro j1655 - 40 , which is interpreted as the sign of a slim disk .",
    "as jet measurements indicate an extremely high inclination for its inner disk ( @xmath15 , @xcite ) , the inner accretion flow is possibly obscured by the slim disk .",
    "this obscuration could , in the lense - thirring precession model , lead to the qpo variations being dominated by quasi - periodic variations of the covering fraction of the inner flow by the slim disk , leading to simple flux variations without corresponding spectral changes that produce the lags .",
    "such a scenario would also account for the other lags measured for gro j1655 - 40 , which are consisent with zero as well .",
    "in addition , it can account for the differences between gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1915 + 105 : while both show remarkable timing properties , and possibly accrete at high rates @xcite , the inclination of grs 1915 + 105 is less extreme ( @xmath16 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in grs 1915 + 105 , nonzero lags are observed as the inclination is not high enough to obscure the inner flow .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 was not considered by @xcite and @xcite , as it does not follow a standard q - shaped hardness - intensity diagram and possesses unique timing properties @xcite .",
    "we have included this source in our sample , both because of the peculiar log - linear dependence of qpo phase lag on qpo frequency , and the clear presence of qpo frequency differences . removing grs 1915",
    "+ 105 decreases the signifance of the inclination dependence of the type - c qpo phase lag : the p - value with the @xmath14 hz cut increases to @xmath17 .",
    "this is both the result of the small uncertainties on the qpo phase lags in grs 1915 + 105 , and most importantly the small number of sources in our sample .",
    "hence , removing a source with relatively many , well - constrained lag measurements has a clear impact on the significance of the inclination dependence .",
    "in fact , the removal of any source with at least as many type - c qpo observations as grs 1915 + 105 results in similar decreases in significance .",
    "in other words , the higher p - value appears to follow from the smaller sample size .",
    "we find that , while the frequency differences are present in a selection of other sources , the log - linear phase lag behaviour is not seen in any other source .",
    "this is especially interesting towards the lowest qpo frequencies , where all other sources tend to zero phase lags , while the hard phase lags in grs 1915 + 105 continue increasing . in our interpretation of the inclination dependence",
    ", this corresponds to a process where the flux increases as the precessing flow increases its inclination . for low inclination sources , at high qpo frequency",
    ", we suggested that this process could be caused by doppler effects .",
    "however , this is less expected at the lower qpo frequencies where the qpo lags in grs 1915 + 105 are hard , as this corresponds to a larger truncation radius .",
    "this is also shown by the model of @xcite : our sketch of their results ( see figure [ fig : valedina ] ) shows that the influence of these doppler effects becomes less prominent for precessing rings of larger radii .",
    "an alternative interpretation is proposed in @xcite through differential precession .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is the only known source showing negative frequency differences ( for qpo frequencies below @xmath11 hz ) @xcite . in the differential precession model",
    ", this is interpreted as a qpo frequency that increases towards the inner radius , spectrally weighted by emission that becomes softer towards smaller radii . in this model",
    ", hard lags could correspond to the average lag of the slower precessing , harder regions with respect to the faster precessing , softer regions .",
    "this interpretation could explain why only grs 1915 + 105 shows hard lags at low qpo frequencies , as it is the only source showing negative frequency differences .",
    "however , why the hardness would decrease towards smaller radii for low qpo frequencies only in grs 1915 + 105 , remains unanswered .",
    "the log - linear dependence of qpo phase lag on frequency , including a sign change , was first reported by @xcite . there , the change in lag sign was interpreted as the result of a change in optical depth of the comptonizing region : a low optical depth , assumed to be present at lower count rates and thus low qpo frequency , results in a hard lag .",
    "higher optical depths , present at high count rates i.e. high qpo frequency , lead to a soft lag .",
    "this scenario does not assume a specific model for the qpo , and hence would be consistent with geometric qpo models .",
    "however , the difference with other high inclination sources , not showing hard lags , is not directly accounted for .",
    "we observe a significant non - zero frequency difference @xmath18 in four out of fifteen sources in our sample . in all cases ,",
    "the trend as a function of qpo frequency is comparable , with a sudden increase in @xmath19 at the highest qpo frequencies ( @xmath20@xmath21 hz ) .",
    "as already stated , three of these sources ( grs 1915 + 105 , xte j1550 - 564 and h1743 - 322 ) are high inclination .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : undetermined ] , the fourth source , xte j1859 + 226 , shows very similar type - c qpo lag behaviour to the high inclination sample .",
    "no low inclination source shows a non - zero @xmath18 ; xte j1650 - 500 for instance covers the same range in qpo frequencies and phase lags ( with opposite sign ) as xte j1859 + 226 , while its @xmath18 does not show non - zero values versus @xmath22 for each source . ] .",
    "this is not due to the size of the uncertainties in xte j1650 - 500  these are much smaller than many of the observed non - zero values of @xmath18 in other sources .    in the high inclination source sample",
    ", three sources do not show significant frequency differences : gro j1655 - 40 , 4u 1630 - 47 and maxi j1659 - 152 . as discussed in section [ sec : gro ] , the timing properties of gro j1655 - 40 might be significantly influenced by the presence of a slim disk . in the latter two sources ,",
    "the lack of frequency differences could simply result from the data quality : for 4u 1630 - 47 , only few qpo observations , with large phase lag uncertainties , are analysed . in maxi j1659 - 152 , the qpo frequency barely passes @xmath21 hz , after which most non - zero frequency differences in other sources are observed .",
    "hence , despite the lack of a clear inclination dependence , the frequency difference might only be observable in high inclination sources .",
    "the analysis of new transient bhxrbs or outbursts is thus vital to investigate this further .",
    "analysing @xmath18 sheds light on the short - time - scale evolution of phase lags in type - c qpos .",
    "such lag evolution was reported by @xcite in grs 1915 + 105 and interpreted as a sign of differential precession of the inner accretion flow . in this interpretation ,",
    "different radii in the inner flow precess at different rates , resulting in the gradual build - up of a warp over the course of @xmath23 precession cycles .",
    "this warp in turn destabalises the precession , leading to the decoherence of the qpo .",
    "this process results in the presence of an enveloping structure ( _ coherent intervals ) _ in the qpo amplitude , in which the phase lag systematically increases , and might be related to the q - factor and _ quasi_-periodic nature of qpos .",
    "although not all sources show a significant @xmath18 , the coherent intervals appear to be present in all sources , as expected in this interpretation : even if no @xmath18 is observed , the precession is still destabilised by the its differential nature .",
    "we measure @xmath18 as a probe of this effect , as the actual measurement of evolving phase lag requires too high a signal - to - noise to be applicable to all sources in our sample .",
    "this approach thus assumes that the link between differential precession and phase lag evolution is generally applicable to bhxrbs",
    ". a more problematic downside of this method is that the observed @xmath18 is not a direct proxy of the intrinsic difference in precession rate between different radii in the inner accretion flow : we can only observe the spectrally weighted @xmath18 .",
    "if each radius emits with the same spectral shape , all energy bands will consist of the same weighted combination of precession frequencies .",
    "thus , no @xmath18 will be observed .    as any observed",
    "@xmath18 is always spectrally weighted , investigating its inclination dependence could provide further information on the emission processes of the differentially precessing flow .",
    "if frequency differences are indeed only visible in edge - on sources , this would imply that the inner flow s spectral appearance in edge - on sources generally differs more at different radii than in face - on sources .",
    "this could for instance result from differences in the amount of scatterings between different inclinations : in face - on sources , photons received from all radii have scattered approximately the same amount of times . in edge - on sources ,",
    "the innermost regions might be more obscured .",
    "as a result , photons from the smallest radii have scattered more , resulting in a harder observed spectrum from these smaller radii . to test such a scenario ,",
    "it is important to test the hypothesis that type - c qpo frequency differences are only visible at high inclination , in a new sample of sources .",
    "in this paper , we present the results of a systematic investigation of the inclination dependence of both phase lags and qpo frequency differences in bhxrbs .",
    "we conclude that    1 .",
    "the type - c qpo lag depends clearly on source inclination , both in sign and behaviour as a function of qpo frequency , 2 .",
    "the type - b qpo lag does not depend significantly on source inclination , but shows distinct behaviour as a function of qpo frequency compared to the type - c qpo , 3 .",
    "the type - c bbn lags show a dependence on inclination , but no clear dependence on qpo frequency , 4 .",
    "four bhxrbs show a difference in type - c qpo frequency between the hard and soft band , none of which are of low inclination , 5 .",
    "xte j1859 + 226 , and to a lesser extent maxi j1543 - 564 , are consistent with being high inclination sources .",
    "these results provide a clear indication that both the type - b and type - c qpos originate from two distinct geometric processes , consistent with recent results .",
    "it is important that the inclination - dependence hypothesis , both for the lags and qpo frequency differences , will be tested in the future in new sources and/or outbursts .",
    "the type - c qpo lags show a very clear and simple difference between high and low inclination : the sign of the phase lag .",
    "hence , this will be easy to test with observations of new black hole transients which show type - c qpos above a few hz and for which the inclination can be determined .",
    "furthermore , systematically investigating energy - dependent frequency differences in the type - c harmonic or type - b fundamental could provide new insights in the differences between qpo types and harmonics .",
