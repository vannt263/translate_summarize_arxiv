    "a preshower photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) was first used in the wa93 experiment to measure the inclusive photon yield and their spatial distributions to study s+au collisions at sps energies @xcite .",

    "part of the observed anisotropy was due to correlations from the neutral pion decay .",
    "the observed anisotropy in photons could not be used to determine the anisotropy in neutral pions , nor could the quantitative contribution from decay correlations be determined at that time .",
    "however , the observed anisotropy was found to be greater than what was observed in a similar sample of venus events , which implicitly include the effect of energy momentum correlations in neutral pion decay .",
    "there now exist methods that enable a determination of the neutral pion anisotropy from a measurement of the anisotropy in azimuthal distribution of inclusive photons @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall show the results on anisotropy in photon emission and its centrality dependence .",
    "we shall use the method detailed in @xcite to estimate the anisotropy in neutral pions and compare the results with the anisotropy measured in the charged pions in the same pseudorapidity region .",
    "the effect of finite granularity of the detector(s ) and the effect of efficiency and purity of the data sample will also be investigated .",
    "the measures of anisotropy are the coefficients in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution .",
    "the precision of these coefficients systematically increases for increasing anisotropy and for increasing multiplicity .",
    "the measured azimuthal angle distribution of the photons in the alice environment can also provide an estimate of the reaction plane of the event .",

    "the silicon pad multiplicity detector ( spmd ) measured charged particles in the region 2.35 to 3.75 .",
    "the present analysis deals with the data in the region 3.25 to 3.75 corresponding to 100% azimuthal coverage for the two detectors in the region of overlap .",

    "the data have been corrected for acceptance .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of the inclusive photons ( and of charged particles ) is plotted for every centrality bin and the inverse of occupancies have been taken as weights in obtaining the event plane angles in the equation above .",
    "this has been done for both pmd and spmd for all centralities . a typical distribution for the second order event plane angles is shown in fig .",

    "the v@xmath14 values are then determined by fitting this distribution to @xmath15 % \\label{aniso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    distribution of particle azimuthal angles is also obtained with respect to the acceptance uncorrected event plane angle .",
    "similar distribution is obtained for mixed events .",
    "the effect of detector anisotropy cancels in the ratio of the two distributions and is used to determine the v@xmath16 values .",
    "the v@xmath14 values obtained this way are the same as obtained for the case by fitting the distribution to fig .",
    "[ flatpsi2]b .",
    "the prime on the v@xmath16 indicates that these are projected on the estimated reaction plane and not the true reaction plane and therefore need a correction factor .",
    "since the estimated event plane fluctuates about the actual event plane due to finite particle multiplicity , the average correction factor for the event plane determination , termed the resolution correction factor ( rcf ) is determined .",
    "experimentally , rcf is obtained using the subevent method described in @xcite . here",
    "every event is divided randomly into two subevents of equal multiplicity and the angle @xmath17 is determined for each subevent .",
    "this enables a determination of a parameter @xmath18 directly from the experimental data using the relation @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the total number of events , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the estimated angles of the two subevents ( labelled @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) and the numerator on the left denotes the number of events having the angle between subevents greater than @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 is then used to determine rcf according to the relation given in the ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the data sample used in the present analysis ,",
    "the resolution correction factors are shown in fig .",
    "rcf@xmath16 is the correction factor for anisotropy of the order n and rcf@xmath26 is the correction factor required when one determines the second order anisotropy with respect to the event plane of the first order .",
    "smaller values of these factors introduce larger errors on the estimated values of the anisotropy .",
    "the resultant values of v@xmath16 for the pmd and for the spmd as a function of centrality are shown in fig .",

    "the anisotropy parameters for the @xmath4-like sample are systematically greater than the corresponding parameters for the charged particles and the anisotropy parameters for both of them decrease monotonically with increasing centrality .",
    "the decay of the neutral pions into photons introduces correlations because of energy momentum conservation , causing an apparent anisotropy in the photons which is different from the actual anisotropy present in the pions .",
    "the process of decay also dilutes the initial correlation present in the neutral pions .",
    "the resultant effect of these two competent effects scales with the experimentally measured quantity @xmath27 and enables a determination of the neutral pion anisotropy using the relation  [ pionani ] as obtained from reference @xcite    @xmath28    the values of the constants in this relation depend weakly on the details of the realistic kinematic distributions of the charged pions . for the present work the values",
    "are taken from the reference cited above . for first and second order , the values of ( a , b , c ) are respectively ( 0.075 , 0.473 , 0.801 ) and ( 0.031 , 0.286 , 0.619 ) .    using the measured values of v@xmath6 in the pmd , and using relation  [ pionani ] ,",
    "the v@xmath6 values for neutral pions are obtained , enabling a comparison with the corresponding values for charged particles .",
    "the anisotropy values for charged particles , for @xmath4-like in the pmd and the deduced anisotropy for neutral pions are all shown in fig .  [",
    "scaled ] . where this agreement is quite good , there are limitations .",
    "certain effects not incorporated are : the effect of finite granularity on the measured values of anisotropy , the effect of charged particle contamination in the @xmath4-like sample , the effect of protons on the spmd and other effects .",
    "the pmd has very fine azimuthal granularity , and the finite granularity does not have any effect on the estimated anisotropy values .",
    "the azimuthal bin size of the spmd is 2 degrees .",
    "this not - so - fine granularity results in a measured charged particle yield which is less than the actual multiplicity .",
    "since the number of hits and their distribution in spmd are used , the coarse granularity also has an effect of diluting the actual azimuthal correlation .",
    "events are simulated with initial anisotropy values and multiplicity .",
    "the granularity of the spmd is incorporated before analysing the data for anisotropy .",
    "the initial conditions are varied to obtain the experimentally measured values of the anisotropy parameters for charged particles . using this anisotropy value along with",
    "the corresponding multiplicity for neutral pions , followed by neutral pion decay kinematics enable to estimate the anisotropy in photons .",
    "these estimates of anisotropy are compared to those measured in the pmd , for both orders .",
    "the anisotropy measured in the pmd are observed to be larger than what is obtained by the method described above .",
    "further , 60% of the @xmath4-like sample is assumed to be decay photons from these neutral pions and 40% of the sample is contaminants .",
    "we assume that these contaminants carry the same anisotropy as those of the charged particles .",
    "we see broad agreement for the first order ( v@xmath6 ) but for the second order , v@xmath7 observed in pmd is systematically larger than what can be obtained by using the values of v@xmath7 for charged particles and using decay kinematics .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "these results are preliminary , and at present there are no known explanations for this excess .",
    "independent of asymmetries in particle emission as studied above , it is possible to determine an event plane from the pmd and investigate any possible asymmetries in charged particle emission , with respect to the event plane . by construction , the asymmetry coefficients ( fourier coefficients ) obtained earlier will result in the maximum value .",
    "the event plane obtained from the pmd may have a little bias as compared to the event plane for the charged particles due to decay .",
    "event planes estimated for different particle species in different rapidity regions could all be different , beyond fluctuations , the difference arising due to different final state effect on the particles while they stream from the point of freezeout to the detectors .",
    "it is then expected that v@xmath7 for charged particles with respect to event plane of the pmd would be less than v@xmath7 as measured using the event plane from the spmd .",
    "the same result is expected if for the estimate of v@xmath7 for @xmath4-like using the event plane of the spmd .",
    "this is observed and is shown in fig .",
    "[ pmdspmd ] .",
    "this demonstrates that the event plane estimated from the pmd can be used to study emission properties of any particle species , in any other acceptance region .",
    "a priori , one expects that the event planes of both the orders are either the same , or perpendicular to each other , depending upon the speed of sound in the colliding matter and the colliding energy of the nuclei .",
    "the estimates of these event planes are affected with fluctuations .",
    "however , correcting for these fluctuations should result in the same numerical value of v@xmath7 determined from event plane of either order .",
    "the data from the pmd suggests that this is not the case , where v@xmath7 determined from the first order event plane from the pmd is systematically lower , in addition to having larger error bars .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ correla]a .",
    "this indicates that one has to look for possible correlations ( or lack of correlations ) between the event plane of the two orders .",
    "the event planes of the two orders may not be correlated due to effects such as initial state density fluctuations .",
    "the absence of this correlation can also arise if the event plane is estimated using particles which are products of decay .",
    "then decay kinematics affects the event planes of different orders differently . to look for correlations between the event plane angles ,",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is deduced , where the average is over the event samples in question .",
    "this is plotted as a function of centrality and is shown in fig .",
    "[ correla]b .",
    "this behaviour is explicable by the decay effect . starting with the same direction for the first and the second order event plane , and the different centralities characterised by different mean multiplicities , a simulation which includes",
    "the neutral pion decay is able to reproduce the observed correlation between the event planes of the two orders .",
    "this shows that the primordial event plane is affected by the decay of the particles , and the quantitative effect is different for the event planes of the two orders .",
    "this results into different values of v@xmath7 as determined from the event planes of the two orders .",
    "a logical extension of the results obtained from pmd in wa98 experiment was to investigate whether the pmd could measure azimuthal anisotropies in photon emission in the alice experiment .",
    "the results of these investigations are detailed in reference  @xcite .",
    "further , can the pmd provide an event plane estimate in the alice environment and if this event plane may be used for studying asymmetries in particle emission .",
    "this was explored using fast simulation techniques , is detailed in reference  @xcite , and we discuss it here .",
    "the physics motivation comes from the suggestion that the absorption of j/@xmath0 by comovers is predicted to be azimuthally asymmetric as compared to an isotropic glauber absorption in the forward region @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry has been predicted to be about 5 - 20 % depending upon the centrality , size and the energy of the colliding nuclei .",
    "any observation of this asymmetry in the yield of j/@xmath0 will enable a determination of the relative contribution of the two absorption processes , essential to make an estimate of the actual suppression of the resonance from the possible quark gluon plasma .",
    "the alice experiment proposes to measure the muons in the dimuon spectrometer d@xmath30s .",
    "the pmd is designed to take data at the highest rate possible in alice , combining the trigger rates for tpc and d@xmath30s .",
    "this makes it a specially attractive detector to provide the event plane necessary for the study of anisotropy in j/@xmath0 absorption .",
    "the possibility of measuring any such anisotropy in the j/@xmath0 emission with respect to the event plane measured from the pmd is investigated .",
    "the data for the investigation is simulated .",
    "the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distribution of the pions and the kaons are generated by parametrising hijing events .",
    "these are generated in the @xmath31 range 0 to 6 and p@xmath32 range 0 to 8 gev / c .",
    "the central events correspond to a maximum charged particle pseudorapidity density of about 6000 . a branching ratio of 11.7 mb is assumed for j/@xmath0 decaying into two muons .",
    "the yield of muons from other sources is not known a priori , and therefore this number is a free parameter .",
    "the muons are added in the acceptance region of the d@xmath30s and their number is proportional to the charged particle multiplicity in the event .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of these muons was motivated by the distribution of the average number of muons per event greater than a particular p@xmath32 , as in reference @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal angles of all the pions and kaons are generated with a certain initial anisotropy .",
    "the azimuthal angles of the j/@xmath0s are generated assuming the absorption is maximum along the event plane .",
    "this produces a maximum yield of the j/@xmath0 in a direction normal to the event plane determined from the charged particles or from the photons .",
    "the hits on the pmd arise from both photons and charged hadrons . after filtering hadrons using",
    "appropriate algorithms , the remaining hits , called `` @xmath4-like '' , contain 60% decay photons .",
    "the azimuthal distributions of these photons reflect the anisotropy present in parent @xmath33 . of the 40% contaminants ,",
    "half are assumed to be initial charged pions , which have the same anisotropy as the neutral pions , and the remaining half are secondaries likely to be randomly distributed .",
    "the generated events contain @xmath4-like hits having suitable mix of charged particles and decay photons according to the above proportion .",
    "the effect of upstream material , which results in scattering of the incident particles , has been investigated for the coverage of the pmd in ref .",
    "this effect is incorporated in the fast simulation by allowing all particles to change direction so that the final @xmath34 differs from the original values by an amount @xmath35 ( = 0.1,0.2 ) , @xmath36 given by a gaussian distribution .",
    "the smaller values are termed as moderate scattering and the larger values correspond to what we term as large scattering .",
    "muon track reconstruction efficiency is assumed to be 0.9 in the d@xmath30s .",
    "the efficiency has been varied between 0.8 to 1.0 and its effect on the sensitivity of the analysis is also studied .",
    "the mass resolution of the j/@xmath0 is considered to be 60 mev .",
    "the invariant mass spectra of opposite sign dimuons is constructed using muons with p@xmath37 1 gev and the two muons following p@xmath38 + 0.5 p@xmath39 2 gev . to extract the resonance yield ,",
    "the invariant mass spectra of the like sign dimuons is also obtained with the same kinematic cuts .",
    "the distribution is then fitted to a polynomial in the region of the resonance mass .",
    "the opposite sign dimuon spectra is then fitted to this polynomial and a gaussian and the yield of the resonance is determined as shown in fig .",
    "[ invmass ]    since the number of added muons is a free parameter in the simulation , the results for the s / b ratio and the significance of the data sample vary with the number of added muons .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ signi ] .",
    "the event planes of both orders are obtained for every event and the resolution correction factor to correct for fluctuations of the event plane due to finite particle multiplicity . to look for any possible anisotropy in the background spectra ,",
    "the invariant mass distribution of the like sign muons is plotted in different azimuthal bins with respect to the event plane , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ bkganiso]a .",
    "the yield in different azimuthal regions in a fixed mass bin is used for obtaining the anisotropy parameters .",
    "this is repeated for different ( overlapping ) mass bins and the anisotropy parameters determined .",
    "there is no measurable anisotropy in the background spectra in the region around the resonance mass , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ bkganiso]b .",
    "the invariant mass spectra in different azimuthal regions is shown in fig.[jpsiyield ] and the j/@xmath0 yield is then analysed to extract the anisotropy components that describe the azimuthal distribution .",
    "this has been repeated for the variety of cases where the particles incident on the pmd remain unscattered by the upstream material , undergo moderate scattering or undergo large scattering .",
    "the observation of anisotropy in j/@xmath0 emission depends on several factors , e.g. , background subtraction in the invariant mass spectra , increase in background due to charm and beauty decays , track reconstruction efficiency for muons in the dimuon spectrometer and the yield of j/@xmath0 from higher resonances .",
    "a systematic study of variation in these parameters suggests that the _ significance _ of the data ( and hence the number of events required ) follows a simple relation with the anisotropy values to be studied and the associated accuracy , and is shown in fig.[scale ] .",
    "the fitted curve is _ significance = 0.7/v@xmath7@xmath40 _ where v@xmath7 is the value of anisotropy to be probed and f is the fractional error .    for a given s / b ratio and muon track reconstruction efficiency , this significance can be translated into the number of events required to enable such a determination .",
    "the photon multiplicity detector has been successfully implemented in the wa93 and wa98 experiments .",
    "the first evidence of azimuthal anisotropy at the sps energies was reported using measurements from the pmd .",
    "subsequently , pmd has obtained systematic dependence of anisotropy coefficients on centrality and the results have been compared with corresponding results from charged particles .",
    "we observe that the elliptic flow observed in the photons is greater than the one expected by assuming same flow for neutral and charged particles .",
    "the anisotropy analysis techniques are such that the error on the estimated anisotropy coefficients are likely to decrease with increasing multiplicity and increasing anisotropy .",
    "the pmd at star and at the alice experiment will be able to provide more precise estimates.we have also shown that the event plane from the pmd can be used to study the anisotropic characteristics of particle emission in the alice experiment at the lhc .",
