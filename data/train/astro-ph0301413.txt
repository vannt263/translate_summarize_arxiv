    "hr  5110 ( = bh  cvn ; hd  118216 ) is a close binary system with an orbital period of 2.61  days .",
    "the system consists of an f2  iv star @xcite and a k0  iv star @xcite .",
    "a tabulated list of selected properties and characteristics of hr  5110 is given in table  [ thestar ] .",
    "hr  5110 is classified as a rs  cvn @xcite , primarily due to strong  h and k emission from the chromosphere of the cooler k star @xcite , although little - marenin et al.demonstrate that hr  5110 can also be considered an algol system seen very close to pole - on ( inclination , @xmath7 ; see table  [ thestar ] ) .",
    "we adopt the _ hipparcos _ distance for hr  5110 of @xmath8  pc @xcite throughout this paper .    radio emission from hr",
    "5110 is relatively strong and highly variable , with a flux density that ranges over approximately two orders of magnitude : quiescent emission levels are in the 520  mjy range @xcite , while flux densities as high as 460  mjy have been observed during intense flaring episodes @xcite .",
    "model fitting of visibility data from past very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of hr  5110 revealed source sizes ranging from 1.0  mas to more than 3.7  mas @xcite .    here",
    "we report on vlbi observations of hr  5110 made on 1994 may 29/30 .",
    "the purpose of the observations was to obtain a position estimate of hr  5110 , which was then a candidate guide star for the nasa / stanford relativity gyroscope experiment , gravity probe  b ( gp - b ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "( hr  5110 was later rejected as the guide star in favor of a different rs  cvn binary , hr  8703 . )",
    "we describe our observations of hr  5110 in  [ obs ] , and the data reduction and analysis procedures in  [ reduc ] . in  [ results ] , we present our vlbi images of hr  5110 as well as gaussian model fits to the visibility data . in  [ discuss ] , we discuss our results and compare them to previous vlbi results for hr  5110 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ concl ] .",
    "we made observations of hr  5110 with a global vlbi array of seven telescopes on 1994  may  29/30 ( see table  [ antab ] ) .",
    "our array had higher sensitivity and better spatial frequency ( ) coverage than previous vlbi observations of this star system .",
    "our total observing time was approximately twelve hours .",
    "the observations were centered at a frequency of 8420  mhz ( @xmath9  cm ) , and were in right - hand circular polarization ( rcp ) only , since two of our antennas , goldstone and robledo , did not customarily support dual - polarization observations and a polarization measurement was not critical to our support of gp - b .",
    "data were recorded with very long baseline array ( vlba ) systems at the very large array ( vla ) and the vlba - hancock station and with mark  iii recording systems in the mark  iiia format at all other stations .",
    "the data were correlated at the haystack observatory .",
    "we used the vla as a stand - alone interferometer ( in addition to using it as an element of our vlbi array ) to monitor the variability of the total flux density and total circular polarization of hr  5110 over the course of our observations .",
    "we observed hr  5110 in a repeating @xmath610  minute cycle ( including antenna slew time ) with three extragalactic reference sources close on the sky ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "table  [ antab ] lists the reference sources observed as well as the dwell time per cycle on each source .",
    "we scheduled the observations this way so that we could employ phase referencing and thus determine a position for the radio emission region of hr  5110 in support of gp - b .",
    "however , once hr  5110 was dropped as the gp - b guide star , we turned our attention entirely to the structure and any relative motions of the emission source that we could discern from a single epoch of observations . since the quality of images generated via hybrid mapping",
    "( see  [ reduc ] ) is superior to that of images generated via phase - reference mapping , we do not discuss our phase - referencing efforts in this paper .",
    "we analyzed the interferometric data from the vla using nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and following standard calibration procedures .",
    "the flux density calibrator source , 3c286 , with flux density defined on the scale of @xcite , was used to set the flux density scale for our vla observations .",
    "we estimate a standard deviation of 5% for this absolute flux density calibration .",
    "we used the aips program dftpl to plot the flux density of hr  5110 , time - averaged in 10 minute intervals , over the course of the observing session .",
    "we also used aips to reduce our vlbi data .",
    "the initial reduction , including fringe - fitting , editing , and preliminary amplitude calibration , was completed in the usual manner ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the final calibration of the complex visibilities and the imaging of hr  5110 was done as follows :    \\1 ) we first imaged the reference sources using the hybrid mapping scheme for continuum imaging described in @xcite .",
    "the initial model for the self - calibration of each source was a point source at the phase center , which is the point in the image corresponding to the position used during the correlation process , with flux density equal to the total rcp flux density found via the vla .",
    "we used the resulting `` final '' images for the three reference sources to determine the antenna - based amplitude gains as a function of time over the course of the observations . for each antenna",
    ", the amplitude gains for the three reference sources agreed to within 5% at all times , so we used the average of these three gains to calibrate the hr  5110 data .",
    "\\2 ) we then imaged hr  5110 using the same hybrid mapping scheme except that we performed no amplitude self - calibration since the star s total flux density varied over the course of the observations .",
    "the initial model for the self - calibration in phase was a point source at the phase center .",
    "note that our procedure discards information about the absolute position and motion of the source since the phase self - calibration serves to align the brightest feature with the phase center .",
    "flux densities measured with vlbi are not directly tied to the flux density scale of @xcite as are those measured with the vla ; rather , the vlbi flux density scale is based on system temperatures measured at each antenna over the course of an observing session .",
    "a comparison of the vla - determined and vlbi - determined flux densities for the three extragalactic reference sources that we observed along with hr  5110 shows that the flux density on the vlbi scale is @xmath11 lower than the flux density on the vla scale , where the uncertainty has been inferred from the ratios computed for each source separately .",
    "however , our clean image of hr  5110 based on vlbi data from the full usable time range ( see  [ mapsandfits ] ) contains @xmath650% less flux density than the mean rcp flux density measured with the vla during the same hours . after accounting for the @xmath11 difference in flux density scales ,",
    "we attribute the remaining difference of @xmath6@xmath12 between the vlbi clean flux density and the mean vla flux density to 1 ) the nonuniform sampling of the  plane with time by our vlbi array over the course of the observations , and 2 ) the possible presence of structure that is at least partially resolved by even the shortest baselines in our vlbi array .",
    "in addition to producing images of hr  5110 , we also fit simple brightness - distribution models to the vlbi data ( averaged into 30 minute bins ) for each baseline using the aips program omfit .",
    "to describe the structure , we used first a one - component model consisting of a single elliptical gaussian .",
    "the center of the elliptical gaussian was fixed at the phase center .",
    "second , we used a two - component model consisting of a circular gaussian and an elliptical gaussian .",
    "the centers of both the circular and elliptical gaussians were fixed at the phase center .",
    "third , we used a three - component model consisting of three circular gaussians .",
    "the circular gaussians were initially arranged east - west and the center of the middle gaussian was fixed at the phase center .",
    "omfit simultaneously estimates both the fit parameters and the time - varying antenna - based phase errors ( i.e. , it self - calibrates in phase ) . for want of any better estimate , the systematic contribution to the uncertainty in the value of each of the fit parameters for",
    "the full usable data set was estimated by monitoring the values of the parameter at each iteration of self - calibration .",
    "we chose as the standard error for each estimated parameter the root - sum - square of the statistical standard deviation of the fit and the maximum deviation of that parameter from its final value obtained during the iteration process .",
    "we also fit the three models described above separately to each of two subsets of the full usable data set corresponding approximately to the first half and the second half of the observations ( see  [ mapsandfits ] for the exact time intervals for each subset ) .",
    "to obtain realistic estimates of the total , mostly systematic , errors for each subset , we repeated the model fit for even smaller subsets of the data .",
    "specifically , we divided the data of each of the above subsets into halves of approximately equal duration and size ( i.e. , number of visibilities ) . in these cases",
    ", we give as the standard error for each estimated parameter for each subset , the root - mean - square ( rms ) of the deviations of the estimates for the two halves of that subset from the fit value for that same subset .",
    "the vla radio light curve , presented in figure  [ hr5110rlc ] , shows that hr  5110 had relatively high radio emission during our 1994  may  29/30 observations .",
    "the flux density in rcp increased from @xmath633  mjy to @xmath695  mjy over the course of the observing period .",
    "the light curve also shows that the fractional circular polarization , defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , represent the flux density in rcp and lcp , was @xmath16 for the first hour of observations , and decreased significantly to @xmath17 by the last hour .",
    "( as expected , the gain calibration for rcp and lcp agreed to within 0.2% , and therefore we believe that the uncertainty in fractional circular polarization is much smaller than the 5% standard error we estimated for the flux density calibration . the uncertainties quoted above",
    "are thus based solely on the scatter in the data points during the corresponding hour . )",
    "the sense of circular polarization , namely right circular , is the same as that observed for hr  5110 in july 1983 @xcite .",
    "the constancy of the sense of circular polarization over time periods of @xmath610 years has been observed in two other rs  cvn systems ( ux  arietis and hr  1099 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of circular polarization in the last hour of our vla observations is approximately that observed previously for hr  5110 in an active emission state ( @xmath62% with a flux density of @xmath6140  mjy at 4.9  ghz ) by @xcite . the observed trend , namely that the circular polarization decreases with increasing flux density , is in good agreement with that found for the rs  cvn system hr  1099 @xcite .",
    "the moderate to high flux density of hr  5110 on 1994  may  29/30 allowed us to detect the star on all vlbi baselines in most scans ( @xmath18 ) throughout our observations .",
    "however , for approximately one hour at both the start and end of our observations , the source was visible at only two of the seven antennas in our array .",
    "we were not able to reliably self - calibrate during these times and , therefore , the useful data set for the imaging process was reduced to a span of ten  hours .",
    "the image made from these ten hours of data ( figure  [ hr5110full ] ) shows that the emission source was extended in the east - west direction .",
    "moreover , the concentration of contours around the brightness peak in the image indicates that there is a compact emission region within the extended region .",
    "this structure is consistent with a core - halo morphology .",
    "there is no clear indication of structure within the compact core .",
    "the models that we fit to the visibility data yield a quantitative parameterization of the emission structure seen in the above image .",
    "the one - component model describes the most basic structure of the source .",
    "its parameters are listed in table  [ fitsone5110 ] . the @xmath19  mas major axis size ( full width at half - maximum : fwhm ) and @xmath20 position angle ( east of north ) of the elliptical gaussian is consistent with the footprint of the emission visible in the image . however",
    ", this model does not describe the compact region at the phase center .",
    "the two - component model provides a better fit to the data ( i.e. , has a 30% lower reduced chi - square ) .",
    "the size ( fwhm ) of the circular gaussian converged to @xmath21  mas , which approximately matches the compact region at the phase center in the image , while the position angle of the elliptical gaussian converged to @xmath22 , equal within the errors to that of the elliptical gaussian in the one - component model .",
    "however , the value of the axial ratio of the elliptical gaussian converged to zero . rather than describing a real feature that is completely unresolved in one dimension ,",
    "the convergence is more plausibly related to : 1 ) the clean beam of the interferometer array being highly elliptical and oriented approximately perpendicular to the major axis of the elliptical gaussian ; and 2 ) the relatively small number of antennas used for self - calibration .",
    "we therefore do not consider this model further .",
    "the best fit was obtained with the three - component model ( 37% lower reduced chi - square compared to the one - component model and 10% lower reduced chi - square compared to the two - component model ) which is roughly consistent with all the structure in the image , namely a compact emission region with additional emission to both east and west .",
    "the parameters for this model are listed in table  [ fitsthree5110 ] .",
    "the central component defines a compact region of size @xmath0  mas ( fwhm ) .",
    "the centers of the east and west components are separated from the center of the central component by only @xmath60.6 times their own fwhms .",
    "they lie along a line in the image plane at a position angle between approximately 50@xmath23 and 70@xmath23 .",
    "based on the separation of the most distant parts of the half - maximum contours of its eastern and western components , we infer that this model defines an extended emission region @xmath3  mas in diameter .",
    "to investigate whether there were significant changes in the source structure of hr  5110 over the course of our observations , we divided the usable data set , as mentioned in  [ reduc ] , into two subsets of nearly equal duration : 1 ) 1994 may 29 , 22:00  ut to may 30 , 02:50  ut ; and 2 ) 1994 may 30 , 02:50 to 08:00  ut .",
    "we self - calibrated and imaged the data from each interval independently using the techniques described in  [ reduc ] .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figure  [ hr5110snap ] . both images are roughly consistent with the image from the entire data set ; i.e. , they show a compact core surrounded by an extended halo .",
    "we also obtained satisfactory fits of one - component and three - component gaussian models to the visibility data for each time interval .",
    "the results for the one - component models are given in rows  2 and 3 of table  [ fitsone5110 ] , and those for the three - component models are given in rows  2 and 3 of table  [ fitsthree5110 ] .",
    "for interval 1 , the three - component model fits the data better ( i.e. , has a 30% lower reduced chi - square ) than the one - component model . for interval 2 , no significant improvement ( in reduced chi - square ) is found with the three - component model in comparison to the one - component model .",
    "the three - component models for intervals 1 and 2 are very similar to the corresponding model for the full time range ; i.e. , the components lie along a position angle between approximately 50@xmath23 and 70@xmath23 , and define an emission region @xmath62.0  mas in diameter ( fwhm ) .",
    "however , while the flux densities of the western and eastern components remained constant within their standard errors from interval 1 to interval 2 , the flux density of the central component increased by @xmath24  mjy ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in addition , there was an increase of @xmath26 from interval 1 to interval 2 in the position angle of the elliptical gaussian in the one - component model .",
    "this change may be indicative of a small `` rotation '' in the source structure .",
    "however , the evidence for rotation is inconclusive for two reasons : first , no such rotation is indicated by our three - component models .",
    "second , our limited  coverage results in significant changes in the size and orientation of the beam of the interferometer array from interval 1 to interval 2 .",
    "the fact that the beam computed for the full set of usable data more closely resembles the beam for interval 1 than that for interval 2 may explain why our estimates for almost all the model parameters for the full data set are closer to the corresponding estimates for interval 1 than to those for interval 2 .",
    "if so , the differences in the beams for the two intervals may also be contributing significant systematic errors to the apparent changes in the parameters for the two intervals . nevertheless , we doubt that such systematic errors account for all of the apparent changes .",
    "the images of the hr  5110 emission source from our 1994 may 29/30 observations show a compact region surrounded by an extended , elongated region . how do the sizes of these regions compare to the separation of the stellar components of the hr  5110 binary system and the diameters of the stars themselves ?",
    "the @xmath3  mas angular size we estimated for the extended region from the parameters of the two outer components in our three - component model ( fit to the full set of usable data ) corresponds to a linear size of @xmath27  cm and indicates that the extended region was @xmath4 times larger than the separation , is determined straightforwardly via the generalization of kepler s third law : @xmath28^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ ] , where @xmath29 is in a.u .",

    "below we discuss the properties of the radio emission of each of the extended and compact regions further .",
    "how do our results compare with previous vlbi results for hr  5110 ?",
    "prior vlbi observations of this system were made at epochs when radio emission was nearly quiescent @xcite , as well as when the radio emission was relatively strong @xcite .",
    "lestrade et al.observed hr  5110 at 8.4  ghz with a four - element vlbi array on 1982 december  19 when the vlbi - determined flux density of the star was @xmath630 mjy .",

    "to that of the single elliptical gaussian component in our one - component model ( fit to the full set of usable data ) , we find that the @xmath19  mas ( fwhm ) major axis size of our single component is slightly larger than the circular size of the single lestrade et al .  component , and the corresponding @xmath50  k brightness temperature of our single component is consistent with the lower bound on the brightness temperature of their single component .",
    "mutel et al .  observed hr  5110 at 5.0  ghz with a six - element array on 1983 july  26 when the total flux density of the star varied between 130 and 170  mjy .",
    "they found a source size of 1.0  mas ( fwhm ) by fitting a single circular gaussian component to their data , which implies a peak brightness temperature of approximately @xmath51  k ( again following hjellming 2000 ) .",
    "the values for the size and brightness temperature of this component lie between those we estimated for the single extended component in our one - component model and the compact central component in our three - component model , but closer to those for the central component in our three - component model .",
    "little - marenin et al",
    ".  observed hr  5110 at 5.0  ghz with a two - element vlbi array on 1981 april  6 during a decay phase of a strong radio flare .",
    "the total flux density during their observation was approximately 200  mjy .",
    "they estimated a source size of 3.7  mas by directly comparing the correlated flux density on their single vlbi baseline to the total flux density from single - dish observations made at the same time by @xcite and assuming a single gaussian component .",
    "this size is approximately twice as large as that we measured for our extended region . though the size estimate of little - marenin et al .",
    "is sensitive to any discrepancies between the flux density scales of the vlbi and single - dish observations , we doubt that such discrepancies can explain the large difference between the two measurements .",
    "thus we believe it probable that there is significant variability in the size of this region .",
    "how does the source structure we observed for hr  5110 compare to what has been observed with vlbi for other close binary systems ?",
    "our images and gaussian models provide evidence that a radio core - halo structure was present in hr  5110 during our observations .",
    "the size , relative to the diameter of the k star , and brightness temperature of our compact source are each consistent with the values characteristic of core emission as given by @xcite .",
    "similarly , the size , relative to the binary separation , and brightness temperature of our extended source are each consistent with the values they give for halo emission .",
    "a core - halo structure has also been observed for the two rs  cvn systems ux  arietis ( mutel et al . ) and hr  1099 @xcite and for the close binary in algol ( mutel et al . ) during periods when each system was in a decay phase of a radio flare .",
    "mutel et al.s model for simultaneous core and halo emission describes a system that is in the decay phase of a flare . in our case ,",
    "the core - halo structure was apparently observed during the onset of a radio flare .",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility that the flare rise we observed is superimposed upon a decay phase of an earlier flare , because there is no record of the flux density history of hr  5110 immediately before our observations .",
    "what can we infer from the time variability of each of the emission regions identified in our images ?",
    "our three - component models indicate that , over the @xmath65  hour period separating the midpoints of intervals 1 and 2 , the flux density of the central component increased by @xmath24  mjy ( @xmath25 ) while the flux densities of the eastern and western components remained roughly constant .",
    "in addition , we note that the sizes of each of the three components remained essentially unchanged , meaning that the brightness temperature of only the central component increased , namely about twofold .",
    "this result suggests that the compact emission region in our images was located at , or close to , the site of flare activity during the observations .",
    "however , the full picture is unclear , because the @xmath52  mjy increase in the combined flux density of all three components in our three - component models does not account for the @xmath640  mjy total flux density increase measured with the vla between the midpoints of intervals 1 and 2 ( even when the vlbi flux density scale is brought into agreement with the vla scale ) .",
    "the discrepancy is probably due to our model not fully representing the structure of the source .",
    "nevertheless , the increase in the flux density of the compact central component relative to the combined flux density in all three components of our three - component models ( from @xmath640% to @xmath653% ) , together with the observed decrease in the total fractional circular polarization ( from @xmath610% to 2.5% ) over the course of our observations , is consistent with the interpretation that we are observing a core - halo structure .",
    "the core - halo model used by @xcite , to reproduce their observed radio spectra for hr  5110 , predicts that at 8.4  ghz the core emission is optically thick while the halo emission is optically thin . since optically thick gyrosynchrotron sources are expected to have a low degree of circular polarization ( @xmath5320% for @xmath54 and @xmath538% for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight to the observer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an increase in the relative strength of the core emission compared to the halo emission would result in a decrease in the total fractional circular polarization of the combined source , consistent with our findings .    over any @xmath65  hour period , the two stellar components of the hr  5110 binary system travel about @xmath57 along their orbital paths .",
    "the projection on the sky of the stars separation vector rotates by nearly the same value since the system is viewed close to face - on ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 apparent rotation of the extended emission region that we found in our one - component models ( but not in our three - component models ) is thus consistent with the system being tidally locked ( see also ransom et al .",
    "2002 in which the radio structure of hr  1099 was found to possibly corotate with the stars in that binary system ) .",
    "if the observed projected rotation is real , and if the extended emission region is indeed fixed with respect to the two stars of the binary system , then we can infer that the direction of rotation of the system is counterclockwise .",
    "more observations are needed to study a possible rotation of the radio structure of hr  5110 in detail .",
    "can we infer the locations with respect to those of the stars within the hr  5110 binary system of each of the compact and extended emission regions seen in our images and gaussian models ?",
    "in contrast to multi - epoch astrometric vlbi studies of close binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a single vlbi epoch gives no definitive information about the location within the system of the emission source .",
    "however , in some cases for a single epoch , the source structure itself suggests a likely location of emission components with respect to the stellar components of the binary .",
    "for example , in the case of the 1996 may  25 observations of hr  1099 by @xcite , the @xmath61.7  mas separation and apparent relative rotation of the two observed compact components suggested two favored alignments within that binary system , namely emission from well separated regions of the cooler k star s corona and emission from both the k and g stars . our results for hr  5110 do not favor any particular alignment .",
    "if , however , we make the reasonable assumption that all the emission we observed on 1994 may  29/30 is centered on the cooler k star in the hr  5110 binary system ( note that f - type stars have not been observed to produce radio emission with flux density @xmath580.6  mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the alignment would be approximately as illustrated in figure  [ hr5110schem]_a , b_. a possible scenario which accounts for the compact and extended emission regions we observed during our observations might then be as follows : our observations began near the start of a radio flare that originated near the surface of the chromospherically active k star .",
    "particle acceleration accompanying the flare gave rise to the compact central component we found in our three - component gaussian models , namely one with an angular size of @xmath59  mas ( fwhm ) , or @xmath1 the diameter of the k star .",
    "as our observations continued , additional particle acceleration by the flare led to an increase in the flux density of hr  5110 from a nearly quiescent level to levels typical of active emission periods .",
    "emission from other energetic particles , possibly originating from earlier flaring on the k star ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "here we summarize our findings :          \\4 .",
    "when we fit a three - component model consisting of three circular gaussian components to our data , the estimated diameter of the central component was @xmath0  mas ( fwhm ) , or @xmath60 of the diameter of the chromospherically active k star in the binary system .",
    "the diameter of this component remained essentially unchanged over the course of the observations .",
    "in contrast , its flux density and brightness temperature nearly doubled during the observations , suggesting that the central component was at or near the site of flare activity .",
    "the two outer components in our three - component model define an extended region @xmath3  mas in its longest dimension oriented at a position angle between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this region is @xmath4 times the separation of the centers of the k and f stars .",
    "the flux densities of each of the outer components remained roughly constant during the observations .",
