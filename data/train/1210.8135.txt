    "( 1 + 1)- galilei group @xmath0 is the kinematical group of non relativistic spacetime of dimension ( 1 + 1 ) . in @xcite an extension of ( n+1)-galilei group by the two dimensional dilation group @xmath1 ( independent space and time dilations ) has been considered for @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting extended group is referred to as the ( n+1)-affine galilei group in the literature .",
    "we follow the similar construction to obtain ( 1 + 1)-affine galilei group @xmath3 .",
    "this group has profound significance in signal analysis and image processing @xcite .",
    "but this group does not seem to have any quantum mechanical features associated with it . in order to have a well defined quantum mechanical feature we have to consider the projective representation of the underlying group .",
    "in other words , we have to find a nontrivial central extension of the given group and consider the true reprsentations of the centrally ( nontrivial ) extended group .",
    "but as in the higher dimensional case ( 3 or more ) @xcite , one could show that the straightforward central extension of @xmath3 fails to generate the mass of the nonrelativistic spinless particle under the stated symmetry .",
    "this problematic feature was remedied by the two step construction of a noncentral extension of ( 1 + 1)-affine galilei group @xmath3 . first taking the central extension of the ( 1 + 1)-galilei group @xmath0 , and then taking the semidirect product of the resulting extended group @xmath4 with the two dimensional dilation group @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", we arrive at the group @xmath5 .",
    "it is to be noted that the group so obtained is a noncentral extension of the ( 1 + 1)-affine galilei group @xmath3 .",
    "the group @xmath6 is defined by the following continuous transformation @xmath7 where in addition to the parameters @xmath8 of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional galilei group @xmath0 we have two more parameters @xmath9 representing independent space and time dilations respectively .",
    "so a generic element @xmath10 of the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional affine galilei group is represented as @xmath11 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a generic element of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional extended galilei group @xmath6 is represented as @xmath12 obeying the following group composition law @xmath13 , b+e^{\\tau}b^{\\prime},a+e^{\\tau}b^{\\prime}v+e^{\\sigma}a^{\\prime } , v+e^{\\sigma-\\tau}v^{\\prime},\\\\ & & \\hspace{4in}\\sigma+\\sigma^{\\prime},\\tau+\\tau^{\\prime})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this section we will study various coadjoint orbits of @xmath6 and develop the required tools to compute the wigner functions built on them .",
    "an element @xmath12 of @xmath14 can be represented by the following matrix @xmath15 where the group multiplication now reduces to matrix multiplication for the matrices given by ( [ eq : matrep - ex - aff - gal ] ) .",
    "it can easily be seen that @xmath16 and @xmath17 are abelian subgroups of @xmath6 . in terms of these two abelian subgroups , @xmath6 can be written as @xmath18 .",
    "now we proceed to find the dual orbits of @xmath6 under @xmath19 in @xmath20 .",
    "if we denote by @xmath21 a generic element of @xmath22 then the action of @xmath23 on @xmath21 is found to be @xmath24    the set of all possible triples @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , form the dual orbit due to the element @xmath21 under @xmath27 in @xmath28 .",
    "so we have to solve the following system of equations for @xmath29 @xmath30 from ( [ eq : dualacteqn - ex - aff - gal ] ) , for nonzero values of @xmath31 , it follows immediately that @xmath32 which in turn reflects the fact that the signs of both @xmath31 and @xmath33 are invariants on the same orbit . for different values of @xmath31 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath33 we have eleven possible orbits as outlined in the following table .",
    "[ h ]    .all possible orbits of @xmath6 in @xmath28 under @xmath36 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can easily see from the above table that the sign of @xmath37 changes as we move back and forth between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the same is true for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "now , we take an arbitrary element @xmath42 from one of the nondegenerate dual orbits and then we act @xmath43 on it to obtain the following vector in @xmath44 , @xmath45,}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{p_{0}x_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{3}}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\hbox{sinch}(\\frac{x_1}{2})}-\\frac{1}{\\hbox{sinch}(\\frac{x_3}{2})}\\right]+\\frac{e_0}{\\hbox{sinch}(\\frac{x_3}{2})}+\\frac{mx_{2}^{2}q_{0}}{2(x_{1}-x_{3})^{2}}\\nonumber\\\\\\ & & \\times\\left[\\frac{1}{\\hbox{sinch}(x_{1}-\\frac{x_3}{2})}+\\frac{1}{\\hbox{sinch}(\\frac{x_3}{2})}-\\frac{2}{\\hbox{sinch}\\;(\\frac{x_1}{2})}\\right],\\frac{q_0}{\\hbox{sinch}(x_{1}-\\frac{x_3}{2})}\\biggr)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that the sign of @xmath46 is invariant under the above transformation . in other words , if we start with a point lying in @xmath38 it can leak into @xmath39 at best .",
    "it can never leak down to @xmath40 or to @xmath41 through the @xmath47 plane .",
    "similarly , if we start with a point in @xmath40 we can end up with a point in @xmath41 under the action of the `` @xmath48 '' map .",
    "but the point can never go across the @xmath47 plane to reach either to @xmath38 or to @xmath39 .",
    "next , we compute the polynomial function @xmath37 given by ( [ eq : explct - expr - pol - fnc - orbt - shp ] ) at the point given by the vector @xmath49 explicitly . @xmath50}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed the following @xmath51 computing the determinant given by the right side of ( [ eq : pol - fnc - atapoint ] ) we have , @xmath52 setting @xmath53 to be zero and letting @xmath54 we get @xmath55 it can be verified that @xmath56 .",
    "also , @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , what ( [ eq : sprt - dtrmng - eq ] ) tells us is that a point @xmath58 in one of the non degenerate dual orbits can only be unstable under the action of `` @xmath48 '' map iff @xmath59 . but @xmath60 which can easily be seen from table [ tab : tablethird ] .",
    "we also find that the points in @xmath39 and those in @xmath40 are all stable under the `` @xmath48 '' map , i.e. they do not leave the corresponding orbits under the action of that map .",
    "the wigner function corresponding to the coadjoint orbit @xmath61 , as a function of @xmath62 can be thought of as the fourier transform of a function @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 also , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is any point from one of the four disjoint nondegenerate dual orbits .",
    "now , for @xmath68 , if @xmath69 were supported on @xmath70 , then @xmath63 would have been identically zero if we chose @xmath71 .",
    "but we have already seen that if we take @xmath72 , @xmath73 can never be in @xmath39 . on the other hand , ( [ eq : spprt - coad - orbt ] ) tells us that if @xmath74 we can end up with @xmath75 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath63 can assume nonzero values when @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the wigner function corresponding to @xmath70 will have its support spread on both the coadjoint orbits @xmath76 and @xmath70 .",
    "now , we consider @xmath77 in equation ( 45 ) .",
    "so , @xmath78 .",
    "now , the question that we are going to address is whether we can have @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "it is obvious from our previous discussion that we can not have such a point in @xmath81 .",
    "again , for an element @xmath74 and @xmath82 we have @xmath63 to be identically zero as @xmath78 by assumption .",
    "therefore , we find the support of @xmath83 always lying inside @xmath76 .    using exactly the same arguments we find that the wigner function @xmath84 is supported inside @xmath85 while the support of @xmath86 is spread out on both the coadjoint orbits @xmath87 and @xmath85 .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that the wigner functions corresponding to the two coadjoint orbits @xmath76 and @xmath85 will have their supports concentrated inside @xmath76 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "it is to be noted that the zero level sets of the polynomial function @xmath37 introduced earlier in this section , restricted to @xmath76 and @xmath85 are not decomposable into hyperplanes .",
    "these two zero - level sets are the two dimensional surfaces in figure [ fig : figsecond ] ( above and below the plane @xmath47 ) correspoding to the degenerate orbits @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively in table [ tab : tablefirst ] .",
    "and hence we have verified that the converse of the following theorem due to a. e. krasowska and s. t. ali @xcite is not true .",
    "@xcite let @xmath90 be a semi - direct product group @xmath91 , such that @xmath27 acts on @xmath92 with open free orbits @xmath93 . if an orbit @xmath94 is a dihedral cone ( i.e. if the zero level set of the polynomial function @xmath37 , restricted to it , can be decomposed into hyperplanes ) then the wigner function @xmath95 has support concentrated on the corresponding coadjoint orbit @xmath96 .",
    "the sufficient condition for the wigner function to be supported on one of its coadjoint orbits is that the corresponding dual orbit be a dihedral cone .",
    "however , it is not a necessary condition for the wigner function to have its support inside one of its coadjoint orbits as we can see from the example of ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional extended affine galilei group .",
    "we extend the ( 1 + 1)-galilei group @xmath0 centrally using the canonical exponent @xmath97 given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are elements of @xmath0 .",
    "the centrally extended galilei group @xmath4 then obeys the following group law @xmath101,b_{1}+b_{2},a_{1}+a_{2}+v_{1}b_{2},v_{1}+v_{2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this group @xmath4 has been called the quantum galilei group in @xcite .",
    "our first goal in this section would be to study this quantum galilei group @xmath4 in detail and subsequently to find its coadjoint orbits .",
    "as will turn out later in this section that by using the standard procedures @xcite , one fails to compute the correct wigner function for @xmath4 built on the relevant coadjoint orbits . in order to remedy this problem",
    "we consider a new exponent @xmath102 @xcite of the ( 1 + 1)-galilei group @xmath0 which is equivalent to @xmath103 and is given by ( [ eq : can - expt ] ) ,    @xmath104    next , we will extend @xmath0 centrally using the exponent @xmath102 given by ( [ eq : new - expt ] ) and denote the resulting group as @xmath105 .",
    "the group composition law for @xmath105 is as follows    @xmath106    we will then find the coadjoint action matrix for @xmath105 which will turn out to be exactly the same as to be found for the quantum galilei group @xmath4 . in other words ,",
    "the geometry of the coadjoint orbits remains unchanged .",
    "and we will arrive at the correct form of wigner functions using this nontrivial central extension of the ( 1 + 1)-galilei group as we will explore by the end of this section .",
    "the group element for the ( 1 + 1)-centrally extended galilei group @xmath4 or the quantum galilei group is found to be the following @xmath107 which we here denote as @xmath108 . and the corresponding group multiplication is given by ( [ eq : grp - law - ex - gal - can ] ) .",
    "the inverse group element is given by @xmath109 in matrix notation @xmath110 the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional extended galilei group @xmath4 or the quantum galilei group can be viewed as @xmath111 .",
    "the action of a pure galilian boost @xmath112 on the abelian subgroup @xmath113 is computed in the following way @xmath114 but according to the group multiplication law , given at the beginning the last expression should equal @xmath115 , from which it follows that @xmath116 let us assume that the dual of the abelian subgroup @xmath117 is parametrized by @xmath118 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the @xmath121 case will be handled separately .",
    "now the dual pairing reads @xmath122\\ ] ] the dual action of @xmath49 on the character group can be defined by the following relation @xmath123 but it is seen that @xmath124 .",

    "the parabola changes its shape continuously .",
    "now , for @xmath121 , the dual orbits are computed separately by putting @xmath118 to be zero in ( [ eq : dual - crdnt - trnfm - quant - gal ] ) .",
    "the corresponding orbits turn out to be simply one dimensional lines parallel to @xmath137-axis lying in the @xmath121-plane . on the other hand , for @xmath138 , the parabolas derived earlier tend to shrink down to lines parallel to @xmath139-axis as @xmath140 . at the other extreme ,",
    "the parabolas tend to widen with the increase of @xmath141 and are almost lines parallel to the @xmath142-axis when @xmath141 is large enough .",
    "we will just consider the parabolic orbits arising from @xmath138 and @xmath143 in this work since the contribution of the @xmath121-plane in the representation level will be extremely meager .",
    "having found the dual orbits for the ( 1 + 1)-extended galilei group or the quantum galilei group @xmath4 in ( 1 + 1)-dimension , we now proceed to find all the unitary irreducible representations of this group using the method suggested by mackey .",
    "we have already found that each dual orbit @xmath144 for the underlying lie group is parametrized by two numbers @xmath145 .",
    "now , we choose a representative @xmath146 from each orbit @xmath144 for distinct ordered pairs of @xmath147 .",
    "mackey s inducing construction suggests that to each dual orbit there corresponds a unitarily inequivalent irreducible representation . in other words",
    ", for each ordered pair @xmath148 , we shall obtain a unitary irreducible representation @xmath149 and for any two different ordered pairs the representations will be unitarily inequivalent .",
    "first , it is evident using ( [ eq : dual - crdnt - trnfm - quant - gal ] ) that the stabilizer subgroup of @xmath150 which leaves a particular character group element , say @xmath151 dual to @xmath152 , stable , is the trivial identity element ( @xmath153 ) of @xmath150 .",

    "the wigner function for the ( 1 + 1)-extended galilei group @xmath105 that we found in ( [ eq : wigfnc - ex - gal - new - expt ] ) , is basically a map between two direct integral hilbert spaces given by @xmath345 for @xmath346 where @xmath295 denotes the space of hilbert - schmidt operators and @xmath347 represents the direct integral hilbert space of measurable hilbert - schmidt operator fields .",
    "the wigner function found in ( [ eq : wigfnc - ex - gal - new - expt ] ) was restricted to the coadjoint orbit @xmath348 . but",
    "the final expression for the wigner function reveals the fact that it is no longer supported on that single coadjoint orbit .",
    "rather it has its support concentrated on the collection of coadjoint orbits exhausting @xmath28 hyperplanes perpendicular to the fourth axis w. for brevity , we ask the reader to go back to section [ subsec : coadorb - quant - gal ] , where we explained the geometry of the relevant coadjoint orbits . in particular , we have a continuous collection of wigner functions being supported in each such hyperplane characterized by the constant @xmath349 . this hyperplane can be called a support plane . in other words",
    ", to each hyperplane ( corresponding to a fixed value of @xmath350 and @xmath230 assuming all real values in @xmath351 ) , we attach all such wigner functions each pertaining to a non - relativistic spinless particle due to a fixed value of @xmath118 ( the analog of @xmath31 , i.e. the mass scale in the extended affine case ) and a definite real internal energy , having the states to be square integrable functions on the coadjoint orbits exhausting the @xmath28 hyperpalne in question . in the language of representations we say that , the wigner function restricted to the coadjoint orbit @xmath352 gets its contribution from representations associated to all the parabolic orbits corresponding to the @xmath209 plane given by @xmath353 in the @xmath354 space .",
    "the corresponding coadjoint orbits exactly exhaust the @xmath28-hyperplane given by @xmath349 embedded in @xmath207 .",
    "therefore , each wigner map is associated with representations @xmath355 due to a fixed value of @xmath118 but all possible real values of @xmath134 .",
    "it was also found in section [ subsec : coadorb - quant - gal ] that it is important to choose the appropriate multiplier to find the correct wigner function for the relevant group .",
    "the appropriateness is defined by the fact that the multiplier should reduce to one given by the weyl - heisenberg group under proper substitution . in this sense , @xmath102 defined by ( [ eq : new - expt ] )",
    "was found to be appropriate in the context of the ( 1 + 1)-galilei group .",
    "next , we ask the question whether under suitable conditions the wigner function for @xmath105 given by equation ( [ eq : wigfnc - ex - gal - new - expt ] ) reduces to the standard one due to the weyl - heisenberg group . one thing that marks",
    "a distinction between the above two groups is that the galilei group has a time translation parameter while the weyl - heisenberg group does not , the second distinguishing characteristic being that the irreducible unitary representations of the former are parameterized by two constants namely @xmath118 and @xmath134 while those of the latter are parameterized only by a single constant @xmath118 . with the above two considerations , we insert two delta like functions @xmath356 and @xmath357 following the substitution of @xmath230 to be zero in equation ( [ eq : wignc - lead - weyl - heisen ] ) to derive the following @xmath358\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\overline{\\hat{\\psi}_{k_{2},e_{0}}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}+\\frac{mv}{2})}\\hat{\\phi}_{k_{2},e_{0}}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}-\\frac{mv}{2})\\delta(e_0)dvde_{0}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{e_0}\\int_{v}e^{ik_{1}^{*}v}\\delta(e_{0})\\overline{\\hat{\\psi}_{k_{2},e_{0}}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}+\\frac{mv}{2})}\\hat{\\phi}_{k_{2},e_{0}}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}-\\frac{mv}{2})dv\\;de_{0}\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int_{v}e^{ik_{1}^{*}v}\\overline{\\hat{\\psi}_{k_{2},0}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}+\\frac{mv}{2})}\\hat{\\phi}_{k_{2},0}(-\\frac{k_{2}^{*}}{k_{2}}-\\frac{mv}{2})dv.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding coadjoint orbits are foliated along one of the two othogonal axes of @xmath207 , along which the coadjoint orbits of the ( 1 + 1)-centrally extended galilei group were foliated ( see section [ subsec : coadorb - quant - gal ] , where the geometry of its coadjoint orbits is discussed at length ) .",
    "the measurable fields of the hilbert - schmidt operators are now indexed only by @xmath118 . the total orbit space ( union of the disjoint coadjoint orbits in question ) is no longer a dense subspace of @xmath207 .",
    "it is just a set of measure zero ( lower dimensional space ) instead .",
    "but it fills out an @xmath28 hyperplane embedded in @xmath207 . each coadjoint orbit here is a cotangent bundle of a parabola characterized by the constant @xmath224 , which is homeomorphic to @xmath209 , the coadjoint orbit for the weyl - heisenberg group .",
    "so , we find that the wigner function for the ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional extended galilei group , computed using an appropriate multiplier , reduces to the one for the weyl - heisenberg group under proper substitution .    the coadjoint action matrix for the ( 1 + 1)-centrally extended galilei group turned out to be independent of the choice of multipliers ( belonging to the same equivalence class ) required to do the extension . in other words",
    ", we always end up with the same coadjoint action matrix no matter what multiplier we choose from the same equivalence class of the second cohomology group @xmath359 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the coadjoint orbits of the ( 1 + 1)-extended affine galilei group @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig : figfirst ] ) disintegrate into a continuous family of parabolas , each of which is parameterized by a specific value of the ordered pair @xmath360 .",
    "these parabolas are just the dual orbits of the ( 1 + 1)-centrally extended galilei group @xmath4 or the quantum galilei group .",
    "this disintegration of the dual orbits resolves the difficulty of a nonrelativistic spinless particle possessing variable mass , but as a price of the remedy , the beauty of the structure of the open free orbits gets lost .",
    "none of the wigner functions associated with the massive nonrelativistic spinless particles under the symmetry of the galilei group remains supported inside the corresponding phase space . in this sense , to earn physically meaningful object we had to sacrifice the associated mathematically elegant structure ."
