    "it is now well established that luminous matter makes up only a small fraction of the mass observed in universe .",
    "a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) is one of the leading candidates for the `` dark '' component of the universe .",
    "one of the most promising methods for the indirect detection of wimps consists of detecting the gamma rays produced by their annihilations in the galactic halo . concerning the nature of wimps ,",
    "the best motivated candidate is the lightest neutralino , a particle predicted by the supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model @xcite .",
    "we implement in our analysis @xcite the lower bounds on the masses of susy particles and higgs boson , as well as the experimental bounds on the branching ratio of the  process and on @xmath0 , for which the more stringent constraint from @xmath1 disfavors important regions of the sugra parameter space ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , we have also taken into account the last data concerning the @xmath2 branching ratio .",
    "for the continuum of gamma rays , the observed differential flux at the earth coming from a direction forming an angle @xmath3 with respect to the galactic center is @xmath4 where the discrete sum is over all dark matter annihilation channels , @xmath5 is the differential gamma - ray yield , @xmath6 is the annihilation cross section averaged over its velocity distribution , @xmath7 is the mass of the dark matter particle , and @xmath8 is the dark matter density .",
    "actually , when comparing to experimental data one must consider the integral of @xmath9 over the spherical region of solid angle @xmath10 given by the angular acceptance of the detector which is pointing towards the galactic center .",
    "for example , for egret @xmath10 is about @xmath11 sr whereas for glast , cangaroo , and hess it is @xmath12 sr .",
    "note that neutralinos move at galactic velocity and therefore their annihilation occurs at rest .",
    "recently , susy dark matter candidates have been studied in the context of realistic halo models including baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "indeed , since the total mass of the inner galaxy is dominated by baryons , the dark matter distribution is likely to have been influenced by the baryonic potential . in particular ,",
    "its density is increased , and as a consequence typical halo profiles such as navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) @xcite and moore et al . @xcite",
    "have a more singular behaviour near the galactic center .",
    "the conclusion of the work in ref .",
    "@xcite is that the gamma - ray flux produced by the annihilation of neutralinos in the galactic center is increased significantly , and is within the sensitivity of incoming experiments , when density profiles with baryonic compression are taken into account .",
    "indeed , highly cusped profiles are deduced from n - body simulations . in particular , nfw @xcite obtained a profile with a behaviour @xmath13 at small distances .",
    "a more singular behaviour , @xmath14 , was obtained by moore et al .",
    ". however , these predictions are valid only for halos without baryons .",
    "one can improve simulations in a more realistic way by taking into account the effect of the normal gas ( baryons ) .",
    "this loses its energy through radiative processes falling to the central region of forming galaxy . as a consequence of this redistribution of mass ,",
    "the resulting gravitational potential is deeper , and the dark matter must move closer to the center increasing its density .",
    "this increase in the dark matter density is often treated using adiabatic invariants .",
    "the present form of the adiabatic compression model was numerically and analytically studied by blumental et al .",
    "this model assumes spherical symmetry , circular orbit for the particles , and conservation of the angular momentum @xmath15 const . , where @xmath16 is the total mass enclosed within radius @xmath17 .",
    "the mass distributions in the initial and final configurations are therefore related by @xmath18 r_f$ ] , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mass profile of the galactic halo before the cooling of the baryons ( obtained through n - body simulations ) , the baryonic composition of the milky way observed now , and the to be determined dark matter component of the halo today , respectively .",
    "this approximation was tested in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a more precise approximation can be obtained including the possibility of elongated orbits @xcite . the models and constraints that we used in this work for the milky way",
    "can be found in table i of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as one can see in @xcite , at small @xmath17 the dark matter density profile following the adiabatic cooling of the baryonic fraction is a steep power law @xmath22 with @xmath23 for a @xmath24(@xmath25 ) compressed model .",
    "as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of indirect detection , @xmath26 can be increased in different ways when the structure of msugra for the soft terms is abandoned . in particular , it is possible to enhance the annihilation channels involving exchange of the cp - odd higgs , @xmath27 , by reducing the higgs mass .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to increase the higgsino components of the lightest neutralino . thus annihilation channels through higgs exchange become more important than in msugra .",
    "this is also the case for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30-exchange channels . as a consequence",
    ", the gamma - ray flux will be increased .",
    "in particular , the most important effects are produced by the non - universality of higgs and gaugino masses .",
    "these can be parameterised , at @xmath31 , as follows @xmath32 and @xmath33 we concentrated in @xcite our analysis on the following representative cases : @xmath34 case _ a ) _ corresponds to msugra with universal soft terms , cases _ b ) _ , _ c ) _ and _ d ) _ correspond to non - universal higgs masses , and finally cases _ e ) _ and _ f ) _ to non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "the cases _ b ) _ , _ c ) _ , _ d ) _ , and _",
    "e ) _ were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are known to produce gamma - ray fluxes larger than in msugra , whereas case _",
    "f ) _ will be of interest when discussing heavy wimp signals predictions in the perspective of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes like e.g. cangaroo .",
    "the egret telescope on board of the compton gamma - ray observatory has carried out the first all - sky survey in high - energy gamma - rays ( @xmath35 30 mev  30 gev ) over a period of 5 years , from april 1991 until september 1996 . as a result of this survey",
    ", it has detected a signal @xcite above about 1 gev , with a value for the flux of about @xmath36 @xmath37  s@xmath38 , that apparently can not be explained with the usual gamma - ray background .",
    "the source , possibly diffuse rather than pointlike , is located within the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 sr ) of the galactic center . due to the lack of precision data in the high energy bins",
    ", it seems impossible however to distinguish any annihilation channel leading to this photon excess .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : egret ] , where case * c ) * of eq .",
    "( [ 3cases ] ) have been studied for a scan on @xmath41 and @xmath42 from 0 to 2 tev and tan@xmath43 .",
    "let us remark that it is possible to differentiate each point of the parameter space ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) by its gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "the higher fluxes for instance corresponds to the closing of the a - pole , whereas the lower flux spectrum is obtained through the opening of the a - pole ( see e.g. point * b * of fig . 3 in @xcite ) .     from the galactic center as functions of the photon energy for the sugra case * c ) * discussed in eq .",
    "( [ 3cases ] ) for @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , compared with data from the egret experiment .",
    "nfw and moore et al .",
    "profiles with adiabatic compression are used with @xmath40 sr .",
    "all points shown after a scan on @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 0  2000 gev ) fulfil the accelerator constraints discussed in the text , and wmap bounds . ]",
    "recently , the cangaroo  ii atmospheric cherenkov telescope has made a significant detection of gamma rays from the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "in particular , the collaboration has published the spectrum obtained in six energy bins , from 200 gev to 3 tev .",
    "observations taken during 2001 and 2002 have detected a statistically significant excess at energies greater than @xmath47 gev , with an integrated flux of @xmath48 .",
    "these measurements indicate a very soft spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "it is interesting to see whether it is possible to obtain such a candidate in sugra scenarios imposing the accelerator and wmap constraints , and withing the framework of adiabatically compressed halos .",
    "the baryonic cooling effect on the fluxes gives us the order of magnitude needed to fit with both data with a 1 tev neutralino in the non  universal case _",
    "e ) _ with @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the cangaroo - ii collaboration in @xcite pointed out already that the egret and cangaroo - ii data can be relatively smoothly connected with a cutoff energy of 13 tev .",
    "typical points of the parameter space fullfilling all experimental constraints and fitting both set of data lie between ( @xmath51 gev , @xmath52 gev ) and ( @xmath53 tev , @xmath54 tev ) .",
    "it is also interesting to see the complementarity of glast with egret and cangaroo .",
    "glast will perform an all - sky survey detection of fluxes with energy from 1 gev to 300 gev , exactly filling the actual lack of experimental data in this energy range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : egretcangaroo ] ) , and checking the cangaroo results .",
    "indeed , we have calculated that the integrated gamma ray flux for such a signal will be around @xmath55 .",
    "we have shown this sensitivity curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : egretcangaroo ] for @xmath56 , which is the typical detector acceptance , following the prescriptions given in @xcite .",
    "we clearly see that glast will finish to cover the entire spectrum .    , compared with data for egret and cangaroo  ii experiments and the expected glast sensitivity . here only the average profile defined in sect .",
    "[ crucial ] with adiabatic compression , @xmath57 , is used . ]",
    "the hess cherenkov telescope experiment has recently published new data on gamma rays , detecting a signal from the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the measured flux and spectrum differ substantially from previous results , in particular those reported by the cangaroo collaboration , exhibiting a much harder power  law energy spectrum with spectral index of about @xmath58 and extended up to 9 tev .",
    "the authors of @xcite already pointed out that if we assume that the observed gamma rays represent a continuum annihilation spectrum , we expect @xmath59 tev . actually such a heavy neutralino - lsp is not natural in the framework of a consistent supergravity model when we impose the renormalisation group equations and radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "although in @xcite we performed some scans in all non universality directions using numerical dichotomy methods , no point in the parameter space in any non - universal case studied was able to give a several 10 tev neutralino satisfying wmap constraint but this can be sensitive to the rge and relic density calculation codes .",
    "nevertheless , without rge and taking soft parameters at the electroweak scale , the constraints are easier to evade . on top of that",
    ", in a very effective approach using completely free parameters and couplings in cross sections , neutralinos with @xmath60 tev and @xmath61 may certainly be fine tuned .",
    "we did not adopt such approaches since the mssm is motivated by high energy and theoretical considerations .",
    "we analyzed in a quite model - independant way the conditions required on the particle physics field to fit with the hess data thanks to dark matter annihilation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hess ] .",
    "we point the fact that we do not only compare the spectrum shape of the signal with possible dark matter annihilation explanation .",
    "indeed , it should be noticed that our compressed halo profiles give rise to absolute gamma fluxes within the hess data order of magnitude with @xmath62 values in agreement with the wmap requirement .",
    "it is worth noticing here than a similiar and more complete analysis was done recently by s. profumo in @xcite .",
    "we have analysed the effect of the compression of the dark matter due to the infall of baryons to the galactic center on the gamma - ray flux . in addition",
    ", we have also consider the effect of non - universal soft terms , that arises naturally in string motivated framework @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that neutralino dark matter annihilation can give rise to signals largely reachable by future experiments like glast .",
    "this is a remarkable result if we realise that direct detection experiments will only be able to cover a small region of the parameter space .",
    "actually , in this sugra framework we have also been able to fit present excess from egret and cangaroo using different non - universal scenarios , and even fit the data from both experiments with only one scenario .",
    "we have also studied the recent hess data implying a neutralino heavier than 12 tev .",
    "we have carried out a quite model - independent analysis , and found the conditions required on the particle physics side to fit the hess data thanks to dark matter annihilation .    in any case",
    ", we must keep in mind that the current data obtained by the different gamma - rays observations from the galactic center region by these three experiments do not allow us to conclude about a dark matter annihilation origin rather than other , less exotic astrophysics sources .",
    "fortunately , this situation may change with the improvement of angular resolution and energy sensitivity of future detectors like glast , which will be a complementary source of gamma - ray data .",
