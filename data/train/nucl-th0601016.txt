    "the hadron parameters for vector mesons embedded in the nucleus may differ significantly from their free space values due to the interaction taken place between the vector mesons and the other nuclear particles present in the nucleus . therefore , the study on the in - medium properties of vector mesons can offer valuable informations about the vector meson dynamics in a nucleus .",
    "in compressed [ @xmath3 and/or hot [ @xmath4 mev ] nuclei , the medium effect on the vector meson could be drastic .",
    "in fact , large medium effect on the rho meson is believed to be seen in the enhanced dilepton yield in ceres and helios ultra - relativistic heavy ion collision data @xcite taken in cern - sps .",
    "theoretically , these data are found to be compatible if the @xmath5 mass is reduced drastically , i.e. , by @xmath6 mev @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , these data are also reproduced successfully by calculations @xcite which incorporate the hadronic interaction for the rho meson with the surrounding nuclear particles .",
    "recent analysis on the @xmath0 pairs , in the star experiment at bnl rhic , showed a decrease in @xmath5 mass in the peripheral au + au collisions @xcite .",
    "there exist some model calculations which envisage the reduction of vector meson mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "for example , the scaling hypothesis due to brown and rho @xcite shows that the mass of vector meson in a nucleus should drop , since the pion weak decay constant does . the qcd sum rule calculation done by hatsuda and",
    "lee @xcite shows that the reduction in the vector meson mass increases with the nuclear density .",

    ", @xcite have shown that the @xmath8 wave @xmath9 scattering [ via @xmath10 and @xmath11 resonances ] reduces the mass of rho meson , and this reduction is significant in high baryon density .",

    "to look for the in - medium properties of vector mesons in a normal nucleus , experimental programmes are there at various centers around the world .",
    "for example , it has been proposed to measure the photo production of vector meson in the nucleus at tjnaf through the @xmath13 radiation @xcite , and at 1.3 gev tokyo electron synchrotron ( ins ) through the @xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "recently , cbelsa / taps collaboration at elsa @xcite had found the medium modification on the omega meson in @xmath14nb nucleus .",
    "the kek - ps e325 collaboration at kek @xcite had measured the @xmath13 yield in the @xmath15 reaction at 12 gev , and they have reported an enhancement in this yield in the region of @xmath16 gev / c@xmath17 due to modified @xmath5 meson in nuclei .",

    "this rho meson , of course , is a virtual particle , since the four - momentum carried by it is constrained by the dispersion relation obeyed by protons .",
    "it is the nucleus which scatters this @xmath1 meson coherently and brings it on - shell .",
