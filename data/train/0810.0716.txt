    "measurements of two- and multi - particle correlations have proven a powerful tool to study heavy ion collision dynamics .",
    "in particular , measurements of two - particle correlations in the form of two - particle densities as a function of the particle pseudorapidities and azimuthal angles in @xmath1 collisions have revealed new correlation features not found in @xmath0 interactions .",
    "specifically , azimuthal two - particle correlations in central @xmath5 collisions exhibit novel  away - side \" structures , commonly referred as the away - side dip , and a near - side structure called the  ridge \" .",
    "first measurements of the  dip \" and  ridge \" were reported on the basis of _ inclusive _ charged particle correlations @xcite .",
    "more recently , measurements were extended to include identified charged and neutral particles , studies of correlations in various momentum ranges and system size dependencies @xcite .",
    "measurements of event - by - event fluctuation observables such as net charge and transverse momentum provide complementary information .",
    "studies of net charge and transverse momentum fluctuations show that while the magnitude of the fluctuations observed in @xmath1 collisions differs from that observed in @xmath0 collisions ( after proper scaling to account for the number of collision participants ) , no dramatic suppression of the net charge fluctuations is observed that might signal the formation of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , only small differences are observed in the magnitude of @xmath6 dynamical fluctuations in @xmath1 collisions relative to those observed in @xmath0 interactions after scaling by the number of participants and the particle average @xmath6 .",
    "the measured dynamical @xmath6 fluctuations in @xmath1 thus do not provide evidence for the strongly enhanced fluctuations expected for nuclear matter near the tri - critical point @xcite .",
    "in contrast , however , the width of the charge balance function exhibits a significant reduction from peripheral to central @xmath7 collisions that is consistent with the predictions of delayed hadronization when a qgp is formed @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the balance function measured as a function of pseudorapidity may , however , result from radial flow , resonance decays , or other effects .",
    "it is thus important to seek additional observables to obtain a better understanding of the @xmath1 collision dynamics .    in this work ,",
    "we consider measurements of differential transverse momentum two - particle correlations as a function of the relative pseudorapidity and azimuthal angles of measured particles .",
    "a certain latitude exists in the calculation of such correlation functions . indeed , as for integral correlations @xcite , one can use both _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ definitions .",
    "one can also consider dynamical fluctuations as the difference between measured fluctuations and statistical fluctuations i.e. those expected for a purely poisson system .",
    "extensions of fluctuation variables @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite are also possible . in this work ,",
    "we study three differential observables namely , _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ correlation functions and a differential version of the measure @xmath2 , used by gavin @xcite to estimate the viscosity per unit entropy of the matter formed in @xmath1 collisions .",

    "[ sect : ptcorrelations ] , we focus on the definition of these observables for the study of transverse momentum correlations between two particles as functions of the relative pseudorapidity , and azimuthal angles of the particles .",

    "these observables may be the momenta , azimuthal angle , pseudorapidity etc .",
    ", of the particles .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be one- and two - particle densities , respectively , defined as functions of these observables .",
    "@xmath14    discussions in this paper are limited to two - particle correlations but can be straightforwardly extended to higher order multi - particle correlations . for simplicity , and illustrative purposes ,",
    "assume the particles are indistinguishable .",
    "integrals of the above densities over the space spanned by observables ( @xmath15 ) yield the number of particles and pairs of particles , respectively , in the domain of integration . @xmath16",
    "@xmath17    where _ n _ is the average number of particles produced in the region of acceptance of interest .",
    "experimentally , the number of particles in a given acceptance fluctuates event - by - event owing to the stochastic nature of the production processes .",
    "the one- and two - particle densities may then be viewed as an average of the number of particles taken over all measured events .",
    "we label events with an index @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of events in the data sample .",
    "one measures the number of particles , @xmath20 at a given location @xmath21 in a bin of width @xmath22 for each event @xmath23 .",
    "the one- particle and two- particle densities are then obtained by averaging over the event ensemble , i.e. the total number of events @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the event - ensemble average of @xmath27 .    in this work",
    "we describe measurements of fluctuations and a differential correlation observable .",
    "this requires measurements of covariances @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the mean value of _ x _ , which is a function of coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "such a function of @xmath31 and @xmath32 corresponds to a @xmath33 average taken with respect to the two - particle density given by eq . 2 .",
    "to denote such averages we use the notation @xmath34 , where g(x ) is some function of the coordinates @xmath35 , @xmath36 and _ n _ = 1,2 signifies the one- or two- particle density , respectively .",
    "for example , the average value of _ x _ as a function of _ y _ , as defined below , denoted @xmath37 , is defined and calculated as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the value of @xmath40 for particle @xmath41 at position @xmath21 in an event @xmath23 . similarly the two - particle covariance @xmath28 , a function of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is denoted @xmath42 and is defined and calculated as : @xmath43    the number of pairs in an event @xmath23 is given by the product of the number of particles , @xmath44 , in bins of width @xmath22 at positions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , the number of pairs is reduced to @xmath45 for identical bins @xmath46 ( indistinguishable particles ) .",
    "the above expressions correspond to what is commonly referred to as _ inclusive _ averages .",
    "an alternative averaging method is also available which corresponds to _ event - wise _ average .",
    "_ event - wise _ averages of @xmath40 and @xmath33 are herein noted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "they are calculated as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 for integral correlations where the above averages are taken over a single wide @xmath21 bin , the above expression ( eq.10 ) reduces to fluctuation variables reported in recent works @xcite .",
    "gavin suggested recently @xcite that the width of transverse momentum fluctuation distributions measured as a function of pseudorapidity may be used to estimate the viscosity of the matter formed in @xmath1 collisions studied at rhic and lhc .",
    "here we consider a differential version of the correlation @xmath2 , and write @xmath51 a number of other observables have been used recently to carry out measurements of fluctuations and are well documented in the literature .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 , defined in @xcite , was used by cern experiments na49 and ceres to measure transverse momentum fluctuations in pb + pb collisions .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 was used by star to measure fluctuations in au + au collisions @xcite .",
    "there is an approximate equivalence between these different integral observables as shown in @xcite",
    "in this section , we focus our discussion on integral and differential transverse momentum correlations .",
    "integral correlations , @xmath54 , may in principle provide an estimate of event - by - event temperature fluctuations which , in turn , may provide means to determine the heat capacity of the medium formed in @xmath1 collisions @xcite . additionally , one can also use the measure @xmath2 , defined in sect . 2 , to study the transverse momentum correlations @xcite .",
    "we argue that a differential version of all the observables , as defined in the previous section , may provide an equivalent or even better way to estimate the medium viscosity . however , calculation of viscosity using these observables is not presented in this work .",
    "clearly , differential correlation functions provide more information than integrals over a wide range of pseudorapidity .",
    "therefore they may enable a deeper understanding of the collision dynamics at play in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "as a specific example one notes the discovery of the  ridge \" in two - particle ( density ) correlations measured in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider differential transverse momentum correlations as a function of differences in particle pseudorapidity and azimuthal angles ( denoted as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ) .    to simplify the notation , we use @xmath57 rather than the  usual \" @xmath6 to denote transverse momentum .",
    "we define the transverse momentum correlations of interest by substituting @xmath57 for @xmath40 in eq .",
    "[ eq7 ] through eq .",
    "[ eq11 ] , and include a dependency on the particles pseudorapidity , @xmath58 , and azimuthal angle , @xmath59 .",
    "the _ inclusive _ momentum correlation function is defined as @xmath60 and calculated using the following expression : @xmath61 where one applies the conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is the number of particles detected in a given event @xmath23 at pseudorapidity @xmath65 and laboratory angle @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath67 represents the transverse momentum of particle @xmath41 from event @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath68 is the _ inclusive _ average particle transverse momentum at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath69 we include dependencies of the average transverse momentum , @xmath57 , on the laboratory angles @xmath70 and @xmath71 to account for possible instrumental effects .",
    "the mean @xmath57 is independent of azimuthal angles @xmath70 and @xmath71 for unpolarized beams .",
    "the detector acceptance and particle detection efficiency may , however , vary with these angles and must thus be accounted for in practice .    the _ event - wise _ transverse momentum correlation is calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath72    and uses the _ event - wise _ average @xmath73 similarly @xmath2 can be written as : @xmath74",
    "the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ differential correlation observables , as well as the correlation measure @xmath2 , are designed to study the magnitude of correlation in terms of some specific kinematic variable _ x _ , where _ x _ may be , _ e.g. , _ the particle transverse momentum or pseudorapidity .",
    "the three observables represent averages of the difference between the _ x _ value of each particle relative to the mean value of _ x_. the three observables , however , employ distinct averaging methods and in general lead to different numerical results",
    ". none of these averaging methods can be considered ",
    "superior \" in any sense .",
    "however , due to practical or technical reasons , studies of correlations are typically reported using one type of averaging only . still other averaging methods were advocated and used in recent works @xcite .",
    "experimenters , therefore , have a choice of observables and have in fact reported data using many of these averaging methods .",
    "the different methods used by several experiments produce results that can not be trivially compared from one experiment to another .",
    "the issue is compounded by the fact that these observables have different dependencies on the detection efficiency and acceptance .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to determine how different are the numerical values produced by these different averaging methods and correlation observable definitions .",
    "one can also find out whether values measured by an experiment using one observable can be meaningfully compared to those of different experiments or measurements using other observables .",
    "we first note that if particle production follows perfect poisson statistics , the correlation functions defined in the previous section are , by construction , null .",
    "the _ inclusive _ , _ event - wise _ and @xmath2 observables are thus trivially identical in the poisson fluctuation limit",
    ". however , due to energy , momentum and quantum number conservation , particle production in general is a non - poissonian stochastic phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _ the correlation functions are non - zero .",
    "below we investigate how different they can be in practice .    in order to investigate the differences between",
    "the _ inclusive _ , _ event - wise _ and @xmath2 observables , we consider a decomposition of the one- and two - particle densities using fixed multiplicity densities .",
    "we write @xmath75 @xmath76    where @xmath77 expresses the probability of having a multiplicity ` _ m _ ' in the measured @xmath58 and @xmath59 bin .",
    "similarly , @xmath78 corresponds to the probability of finding @xmath79 and @xmath80 particles simultaneously in bins ( @xmath81 ) and ( @xmath82 ) , respectively . @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the single and pair densities for a fixed value of multiplicity @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "note that in the above expressions we have included a dependency on @xmath58 only for brevity ( @xmath59 dependencies can obviously also be included ) . by construction",
    ", one has @xmath87",
    "@xmath88    integration restricted to particle momenta yields the pseudorapidity densities : @xmath89    the averages of the transverse momentum , @xmath57 , and @xmath90 at fixed multiplicity ` _ m _ ' are @xmath91    given the multiplicity @xmath85 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) is ( are ) fixed , the above expressions are valid and identical for the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ averaging methods .",
    "thus for fixed multiplicity densities the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ averages are truely comparable for analyzing actual densities such as occur in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions . based on eqs .",
    "[ eq12 ] , [ eq13 ] , [ eq17 ] & [ eq18 ] , the _ inclusive _ @xmath6 and @xmath92 means are expressed as follows in terms of the fixed multiplicity densities : @xmath93    the mean @xmath6 and the @xmath92 fluctuations within a single wide range of pseudorapidity are given by @xmath94    the _ event - wise _",
    "mean @xmath6 and the @xmath92 are calculated in a similar fashion .",
    "@xmath95    for a wide bin of integrated pseudorapidity",
    "this becomes @xmath96",
    "lastly , @xmath2 expressed in terms of fixed multiplicity densities is calculated as follows : @xmath97    though the _ inclusive _ , _ event - wise _ and @xmath2 quantities are manifestly different , they exhibit interesting similarities .",
    "we first consider the difference between the _ inclusive _ mean , @xmath98 , and the _ event - wise _ mean , @xmath99 , for large integrated ranges of pseudorapidity .",
    "assuming @xmath100 is roughly constant over the multiplicity range of interest , one finds @xmath101    _ i.e. _ the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _",
    "mean @xmath99 should be approximately equal .",
    "this approximation is most likely valid for large domains of integration in pseudorapidity and in central @xmath1 collisions , which yield large multiplicities . in this case",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that @xmath100 varies slowly with _",
    "m _ and one thus expects the difference between the two observables to be the smallest . on the other hand for small domains of integration or small multiplicity @xmath100",
    "is more likely to depend on _ m _ and consequently one expects the two average methods to exhibit larger numerical differences .",
    "the _ inclusive _ , _ event - wise _ and @xmath2 two - particle correlations can be approximated in the same manner .",
    "one finds for integral , or wide bin averages : @xmath102    where we have again assumed both @xmath100 and @xmath103 vary slowly with ` _ m _ ' . one finds that in the limit where @xmath100 and @xmath103 are independent of @xmath85 , the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ observables are strictly equal . in practice ,",
    "the equality is only approximate given the average particle momentum is a function of event multiplicity .",
    "additionally , given that for large values of @xmath85 , and relatively narrow range of multiplicity values , the ratio @xmath104 is , typically near unity .",
    "therefore , one concludes that @xmath2 is also roughly equal to @xmath105 for large multiplicities .",
    "the above arguments and approximate equalities hold for integral correlations ( or fluctuations ) but are weaker for differential correlations .",
    "indeed , in the case of differential correlations , the number of particle in a given pseudorapidity bin is quite small .",
    "the approximations used in eqs .",
    "[ eq19 ] & [ eq20 ] are thus likely to be inappropriate and one should expect significant differences between the three observables ; particularly between the _ inclusive _ average and @xmath2 .",
    "any comparison of results from experiments reported on the basis of different observables is thus at best qualitative .",
    "we explore these differences further in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] on the basis of pythia simulations .",
    "we use pythia ( version 6.22 ) @xcite to simulate @xmath0 collisions at @xmath106 gev and carry out calculations of transverse momentum correlations based on the observables introduced in sect [ sect : ptcorrelations ] .",
    "five million minimum bias pythia events were integrated to produce plots shown in the following .",
    "figures [ fig:1](a - c ) show the _ inclusive _ , @xmath107 , _ event - wise _ ,",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath2 correlation functions , respectively , for particles in the pseudorapidity range @xmath109 and transverse momentum range @xmath110 gev / c .",
    "the two - particle correlations are plotted as a function of the particles relative pseudorapidity , @xmath111 , and azimuthal angles , @xmath112 , using 31 and 36 bins , respectively .",
    "the three correlation functions show qualitative similarities : all three observables exhibit a peak structure near @xmath113 ( near side ) and a ridge - like structure at @xmath114 ( away side ) which extends over the full @xmath111 range .",
    "these shapes are qualitatively similar to that of density correlations predicted by pythia @xcite . while the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ correlation functions are identical to each other with a difference of only 0.2% ( statistical errors are of the order of @xmath1150.001 ) , the observable @xmath2 exhibits characteristically different strength and shape .",
    "in contrast to _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ observables , the away side ridge - like structure has larger magnitude than the near side .",
    "one also finds that @xmath2 has a strength five times larger than the other two observables .",
    "a detailed study of @xmath2 reveals that the shape is largely determined by density correlations , @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast to _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ measures , which are designed to minimize the number density contribution @xmath2 is sensitive to the variation of the @xmath99 of the particles as well as the number density . as a result we conclude that the differences between the three observables stem from their specific definitions and hence they lead to very different numerical results .",
    "measurements of two - particle correlation functions , @xmath117 , in @xmath118 collisions reveal the presence of a strong ridge - like structure on the near - side , @xmath119 , and small correlation yield on the away - side , @xmath120 , while elliptic flow appears as a rather modest contribution to the overall yield of the correlation function .",
    "authors of ref . @xcite have suggested the change in the shape of the correlation functions , in which a ridge - like structure shifts from @xmath120 to @xmath121 , might in part be caused by strong radial flow present in mid to central @xmath1 collisions .",
    "it is thus interesting to test the radial flow scenario by considering the effects of radial flow on transverse momentum correlations .",
    "figures [ fig:2](a - c ) show the _ inclusive _ , _ event - wise _ and @xmath2 correlation functions calculated for radially boosted @xmath0 events .",
    "all particles produced by a given @xmath0 event are boosted radially in the transverse plane with factor @xmath122 .",
    "radial flow imparts kinematic focussing , as a result of which all the particles from each @xmath0 collisions are pushed in the same direction and hence become correlated in azimuth . indeed one finds a significant correlated yield at large pair separation in pseudorapidity and narrow separation in azimuth on the near side of all the three observables .",
    "the _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ measures are qualitatively similar with a peak and ridge - like structure on the near side and diminished correlations on the away side .",
    "however , @xmath2 differs quantitatively .",
    "the away side correlations are reduced significantly and the near side peak - like structure is more prominent vis - a - vis _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ observables .",
    "also , the strength of @xmath2 for boosted @xmath0 events is nearly 10 times larger than the strength of the other two observables .",
    "these simulations show that radial flow in @xmath5 collisions can produce a near - side ridge extending in pseudorapidity in transverse momentum correlations as well as in two - particle density correlations .",
    "in this section , we consider the @xmath123 dependence on the number of participants in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we use as a reference collisions where nucleon - nucleon interactions are independent of one another and we neglect re - scattering of the produced particles .    under such assumptions , the two - particle density in @xmath1 collisions at fixed number of participants , @xmath124 , may be written as follows : @xmath125    the _ inclusive _ differential transverse momentum correlation function at fixed @xmath124 in @xmath1 collisions , @xmath126 is then : @xmath127    where we have included , for simplicity , only dependencies on the pseudorapidity of the particles . the simplification obtained on the second line in eq .",
    "[ eq39 ] arises because the average of @xmath128 ( first term of the numerator ) is by construction null .",
    "experimentally , one can not constrain the collision impact parameter , so one must account for fluctuations in the number of participants . the _ inclusive _ differential correlation function",
    "is then @xmath129    fluctuations in the number of @xmath0 interactions have poisson statistics in the context of our independent collisions model .",
    "it implies : @xmath130 additionally , since @xmath131 one expects @xmath132    _ i.e. _ the _ inclusive _ transverse momentum correlations in @xmath1 collisions should be approximately proportional to those measured in @xmath0 collisions and inversely proportional to the number of participants .",
    "we check this result by artificially constructing @xmath1 events on the basis of a superposition of independent _",
    "n _  =  15 @xmath0 collisions generated with pythia .",
    "figures [ fig:3](a - c ) display correlation functions obtained with _",
    "n _  =  15 independent @xmath0 collisions modeling @xmath1 collisions with 30 participants .",
    "a total of two million minimum bias events were integrated to produce these results .",
    "the most prominent feature observed for all the observables is the dilution of signal strength .",
    "the signal strength is diluted by a factor of 15 as compared to that found in @xmath0 collisions ( shown in figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this effect is attributed to 15 times larger multiplicity produced for _",
    "n _  =  15 independent @xmath0 collisions .",
    "the shape of _ inclusive _ and _ event - wise _ observables , with a peak - like structure on the near side and a ridge - like structure on the away side is still observed , as previously observed for figure [ fig:1](a , b ) .",
    "similarly we observe the same shape of @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ larger amplitude of the away side ridge vis - a - vis the near side peak .",
    "we also present results on @xmath1 collisions produced by the superposition of _ n _  =  100 @xmath0 collisions , i.e. , 200 participants .",
    "two million minimum bias events were integrated to present the results in figure [ fig:44](a - c ) .",
    "as expected , we observe the signal strength is diluted by a factor of 100 .",
    "we next consider the effect of radial flow on artificially generated @xmath1 collisions . as for figures [ fig:4](a - c ) , we produce @xmath1 collisions consisting of _ n _  =  15 independent @xmath0 interactions . particles of a given interaction are now boosted radially in the transverse plane with @xmath122 .",
    "the dominant features remains the same as discussed previously for figures [ fig:2](a - c ) , i.e. , observation of diminished away - side ridge - like correlations and enhanced near - side correlation for all the three observables .",
    "therefore , on the basis of simulated @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions , we conclude that strong radial flow should shift the away side structure to the near side in @xmath1 collisions and thereby produce a ridge in momentum correlations .",
    "flow plays an important role in heavy ion collisions .",
    "it particularly affects particle correlations in azimuth . the effect of elliptic flow on azimuthal ( density ) correlations is well documented @xcite",
    "here , we consider its effect on transverse momentum correlations studied as a function of relative azimuthal angles and pseudorapidity .",

    "@xmath142    we find the magnitude of the @xmath92 correlations associated with a flowing medium are determined by the flow coefficients weighted by the transverse momentum and the averaged transverse momentum of the system .",
    "the correlations exhibit cosine modulations in azimuth .",
    "it is observed in @xmath7 collisions at rhic that flow coefficients and average transverse momentum are both functions of the pseudorapidity of the particles @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect , based on eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] , the @xmath92 two - particle correlations associated with flow are also a function of the particles pseudorapidity difference .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy coefficients measured at rhic are largely dominated by elliptic flow ( @xmath143 ) coefficients .",
    "flow modulations of the _ inclusive _ correlations should then also dominated by second order harmonic coefficients .",
    "measurements of correlation observables in @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions require one applies corrections for the limited acceptance and detection efficiency . in some cases",
    ", correlation functions may be formulated in such a way that detection efficiency partly cancels .",
    "this was discussed already by a number of authors for various correlation observables .",
    "see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the robustness of factorial moments and the observable , @xmath144 , used in measurements of charge correlations . in this section , we investigate the extent to which the transverse momentum differential correlation functions , defined in sect .",
    "[ sect : ptcorrelations ] , are robust observables .",
    "we use simple simulations to explicitly verify the robustness of these observables in contexts where efficiencies are non - trivial functions of the particle kinematics .    neglecting instrumental effects such as track splitting , ghost tracks _",
    "etc_. , the single - particle and pair yields , @xmath145 and @xmath146 measured at some @xmath6 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , are the products of the one- and two - particle densities by efficiencies @xmath147 and @xmath148 for measuring one- and two- particles , respectively .    @xmath149    in the above equations , @xmath40 represents the measured variables @xmath6 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the ` raw ' momentum correlation , @xmath150 , is thus a function of the detection efficiency .",
    "we show in the appendix that particle losses due to limited efficiency in general lead to a modification of the fixed multiplicity momentum averages .",
    "measurements of average momentum are consequently intrinsically non - robust .",
    "however , one also finds that if the average @xmath6 is independent of , or varies slowly with , the event multiplicity , one can apply eq .",
