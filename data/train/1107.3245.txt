    "over the period of twelve years of research on quantum games @xcite , the idea of quantum strategic @xmath1 game @xcite has been well established . from mathematical point of view",
    ", the quantum information approach to a @xmath2 game is described by the four - tuple : @xmath3 the hilbert space @xmath4 is the place of the game and the sets of unitary operators @xmath5 play the role of strategy sets for the first and the second player , respectively . given a unit vector @xmath6 ( _ the initial state _ ) , the players each choose a unitary operator @xmath7 changing the vector @xmath8 into the vector @xmath9 ( _ the final state _ ) .",
    "the last components are the functionals @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "they imitate payoff functions for the players assigning a real number to the final state @xmath12 .",
    "it turns out that the four tuple ( [ fourtuple ] ) generalizes playing a classical @xmath1 game .",
    "the two well - known ways based on the framework ( [ fourtuple ] ) : the eisert - wilkens - lewenstein ( ewl ) scheme @xcite and the marinatto - weber ( mw ) scheme @xcite show that a @xmath2 game can be successfully written in the form ( [ fourtuple ] ) : it is possible to set each of the four components , so that a @xmath2 game and the corresponding game defined by the four - tuple ( [ fourtuple ] ) are the same with respect to a game - theoretic analysis .",
    "another key feature is that the protocol ( [ fourtuple ] ) allows to achieve results unavailable in the game played classically ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . in our paper",
    "we are going to deal with extensive games in quantum domain . in spite of quite many researches connected with this issue ( for instance , concerning quantum stackelberg duopoly @xcite and @xcite ) ,",
    "there is no generally accepted framework for playing quantum extensive games by now .",
    "interestingly , we have shown in @xcite that ( [ fourtuple ] ) may indeed be useful for extensive games with imperfect information . in this paper , we extend our previous idea .",
    "we prove that the slight modification of @xmath13 allows to obtain normal representation of extensive games in the quantum domain .",
    "definitions in the preliminaries are based on @xcite .",
    "this section starts with a  definition of a  finite extensive game ( without chance moves ) .",
    "let the following components be given :    * a finite set @xmath14 of players . * a finite set @xmath15 of finite sequences that satisfies the following two properties : * * the empty sequence @xmath16 is a member of @xmath15 ; * * if @xmath17 and @xmath18 then @xmath19 .",
    "+ each member of @xmath15 is a history and each component of a history is an action taken by a player . a history @xmath20 is terminal if there is no @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "the set of actions available after the nonterminal history @xmath23 is denoted @xmath24 and the set of terminal histories is denoted @xmath25 .",
    "* the player function @xmath26 that points to a player who takes an  action after the history @xmath23 .",
    "* for each player @xmath27 a partition @xmath28 of @xmath29 with the property that for each @xmath30 and for each @xmath23 , @xmath31 @xmath32 an equality @xmath33 is fulfilled .",
    "every information set @xmath34 of the partition corresponds to the state of player s knowledge .",
    "when the player makes move after certain history @xmath23 belonging to @xmath34 , she knows that the course of events of the game takes the form of one of histories being part of this information set .",
    "she does not know , however , if it is the history @xmath23 or the other history from @xmath34 . * for each player",
    "@xmath35 a utility function @xmath36 which assigns a number ( payoff ) to each of the terminal histories",
    ".    a five - tuple @xmath37 is called a finite extensive game . [ edefinition ]    our deliberations focus on games with perfect recall ( although def .",
    "[ edefinition ] defines extensive games with imperfect recall as well ) - this means games in which at each stage every player remembers all the information about a course of the game that she knew earlier ( see @xcite and @xcite to learn about formal description of this feature ) .",
    "the notions : action and strategy mean the same in static games , because players choose their actions once and simultaneously . in the majority of extensive games",
    "a player can make her decision about an action depending on all the actions taken previously by herself and also by all the other players .",
    "in other words , players can make some plans of actions at their disposal such that these plans point out to a specific action depending on the course of a  game .",
    "such a plan is defined as a strategy in an extensive game .",
    "a pure strategy @xmath38 of a player @xmath39 in a game @xmath40 is a  function that assigns an action in @xmath41 to each information set @xmath42 .",
    "[ strategy ]    like in the theory of strategic games , _ a mixed strategy _",
    "@xmath43 of a player @xmath39 in an extensive game is a probability distribution over the set of player @xmath39 s pure strategies .",
    "therefore , pure strategies are of course special cases of mixed strategies and from this place whenever we shall write _ strategy _ without specifying that it is either pure or mixed , this term will cover both cases .",
    "let us define an _",
    "outcome @xmath44 _ of a pure strategy profile @xmath45 in an extensive game without chance moves to be a terminal history that results if each player @xmath27 follows the plan of @xmath38 .",
    "more formally , @xmath44 is the history @xmath46 such that for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 .",
    "let an extensive game @xmath49 be given .",
    "the normal representation of @xmath50 is a  strategic game @xmath51 in which for each player @xmath35 :    * @xmath52 is the set of pure strategies of a player @xmath39 in @xmath50 ; * @xmath53 defined as @xmath54 for every @xmath55 and @xmath35 .",
    "one of the most important notions in game theory is a notion of an equilibrium introduced by john nash in @xcite .",
    "a nash equilibrium is a profile of strategies where the strategy of each player is optimal if the choice of its opponents is fixed . in other words , in the equilibrium none of the players has any reason to unilaterally deviate from an equilibrium strategy .",
    "a precise formulation is as follows :    let @xmath56 be a game in strategic form .",
    "a profile of strategies @xmath57 is a nash equilibrium if for each player @xmath35 and for all @xmath58 : @xmath59 [ nashequilibrium ]    a nash equilibrium in an extensive game with perfect recall is a nash equilibrium of its normal representation , hence def .",
    "[ nashequilibrium ] applies to strategic games as well as to extensive ones .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the dirac notation and basic terms of quantum information .",
    "the preliminaries are based on @xcite and are sufficient to study the paper .",
    "nonetheless , we encourage the reader unfamiliar with techniques from theory of quantum information to consult @xcite and , for example , @xcite .",
    "first of all we adopt the convention that instead of denoting vectors by boldface letters , e.g. @xmath60 , they are denoted as _ kets _ : @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a vector space with the fixed basis @xmath63 and let @xmath64 the vector @xmath65 can be also written in the column matrix notation @xmath66 let @xmath62 be now regarded as a hilbert space and @xmath67 .",
    "the inner product of the vector @xmath65 with the vector @xmath68 will be denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "the notation @xmath70 is used for the dual vector to @xmath65 . the dual vector @xmath70 ( also called _ bra _ ) is a linear operator @xmath71 defined by @xmath72 thus , the inner product requirements imply that @xmath73 the common assumption in quantum computing is to consider hilbert space @xmath62 with an orthonormal basis .",
    "let us denote the basis as @xmath74 ( also called _ computational basis _ ) .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be the vectors with respect to the basis @xmath74 . then the inner product @xmath77 can be expressed in terms of matrix multiplication : @xmath78 in this case , the dual vector @xmath79 has a row matrix representation whose entries are complex conjugates of the corresponding entries of the column matrix representation of @xmath65 .",
    "the fundamental concept of quantum information is _ quantum bit _ ( _ qubit _ ) described mathematically as a unit vector @xmath80 in a hilbert space @xmath81 .",
    "according to the notation explained above : @xmath82 the measurement of a qubit with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath83 ( not necessarily in the computational basis ) yields the result @xmath84 or @xmath85 with probability @xmath86 leaving the qubit in the corresponding state @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , measuring the qubit given by ( [ qubit ] ) with respect to @xmath89 results in the outcome 0 with probability @xmath90 and the outcome 1 with probability @xmath91 , with post - measurement states @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath94 and @xmath95 are hilbert spaces with orthonormal bases @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "then the tensor product @xmath98 is a  hilbert space of @xmath99 dimensionality with the orthonormal basis @xmath100 .",
    "the matrix representation of an element @xmath101 is the kronecker product of respective matrix representations of @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in the further part of the paper we use the abbreviated notation @xmath104 or @xmath105 for the tensor product @xmath101 .",
    "a system of @xmath106 qubits @xmath107 is described as a unit vector @xmath108 in the tensor product space @xmath109 that has @xmath110-element computational basis @xmath111 we say that the state ( [ multiple ] ) is _ separable _ if it can be written as @xmath112 for some @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the dual vector @xmath115 is defined in the same way as in ( [ dual ] ) .",
    "similarly , the measurement of the state given by ( [ multiple ] ) with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath116 yields the result @xmath117 with probability @xmath118 . otherwise , the state @xmath108 is called _",
    "entangled_.    we use the dirac notation throughout the whole paper .",
    "however , each of the results below can be easily reconstructed using the matrix notation .",
    "from that moment on , we will consider extensive games with two available actions at each information set so that we could use only qubits for convienience .",
    "any game richer in actions can be transferred to quantum domain by using quantum objects of higher dimensionality .",
    "let us extend the protocol ( [ fourtuple ] ) to include components making it useful for extensive games .",
    "such a quantum game is specified by a six - tuple : @xmath119 where the components are defined as follows :    * @xmath120 is a complex hilbert space @xmath121 with an orthonormal basis @xmath122 .",
    "* @xmath123 is a set of players with the property that @xmath124 .",
    "* @xmath125 is the initial state of a quantum system of @xmath126 qubits @xmath127 is a surjective mapping .",
    "a value @xmath128 indicates a  player who carries out a unitary operation on a qubit @xmath129 . * for each @xmath130 the set @xmath131 is a subset of unitary operators from @xmath132 that are available for a qubit @xmath133 .",
    "a  ( pure ) strategy of a player @xmath39 is a  map @xmath134 that assigns a unitary operation @xmath135 to a qubit @xmath129 for every @xmath136 .",
    "the final state @xmath12 when the players have performed their strategies on corresponding qubits is defined as : latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\mathrm{fin}}\\rangle\\mathrel{\\mathop:}= ( \\tau_{1},\\tau_{2},\\dots,\\tau_{n})|\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}}\\rangle = \\bigotimes_{i\\in n}\\bigotimes_{j\\in \\xi^{-1}(i)}u_{j }    * for each @xmath27 the map @xmath138 is a utility ( payoff ) functional that specifies a  utility for the player @xmath39 .",
    "the functional @xmath138 is defined by the formula : @xmath139    there are only two additional components in ( [ sixtuple ] ) : @xmath123 and @xmath140 , in comparison with ( [ fourtuple ] ) .",
    "they completely specify qubits to which a player is permitted to apply her unitary operator .",
    "notice also that the protocol of quantization of strategic games according to @xcite is obtained from @xmath141 by putting @xmath142 .",
    "we claim that such addition together with appropriate fixed values @xmath143 in ( [ eformula ] ) are sufficient for considering an extensive game in quantum domain ( of course , if the assumption that the tuple @xmath13 correctly describes strategic games in quantum domain is true ) .",
    "the line of thought is as follows .",
    "any strategic game can be considered as a special case of an extensive game where players move sequentially but each of them does not have any knowledge about actions taken by the other players . in other words , each player in a strategic game has exactly one information set in which she takes an action .",
    "thus , in a simple case of @xmath2 bimatrix game , the scheme ( [ fourtuple ] ) , in fact , identifies an operation on a qubit with player s move made at her unique information set , and then the individual game outcomes are assigned to appropriate measurement results .",
    "an extensive game can have many information sets , and more than one of them can be assigned to the same player .",
    "therefore , our extension of @xmath144 ) the normal representation of an extensive game .    before we formulate the formal statement , notice first that the tuple ( [ sixtuple ] ) , in fact , determines some game in strategic form in the sense of classical game theory .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath125 are fixed , each player @xmath27 chooses her strategy from a set @xmath145 and then the associated utility @xmath138 is determined .",
    "therefore , it always makes sense to associate ( [ sixtuple ] ) with some @xmath146 .",
    "secondly , let us specify a sufficient condition of equivalence for two strategic games @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "namely , if there is a  bijective mapping @xmath149 for each @xmath35 such that for each profile @xmath55 we have @xmath150 where @xmath151 , then the games are _ isomorphic _ ( to find out more about isomorphisms of strategic games see @xcite ) .",
    "now , we can formulate the following proposition :    [ propositiondupa ] let @xmath152 be a finite extensive game with two available actions at each information set .",
    "then there exists a six - tuple ( [ sixtuple ] ) that specifies a game isomorphic to the normal representation of  @xmath50 .",
    "let us consider an @xmath106-player extensive game @xmath50 with @xmath126 information sets .",
    "in addition , let us assume two - element set of available actions @xmath41 in each information set @xmath34 .",
    "we specify components of the tuple @xmath153 as follows .",
    "let @xmath122 be the computational basis of @xmath154 and let the initial state @xmath125 be of the form @xmath155 , where @xmath155 is some fixed state of @xmath122 .",
    "let us restrict the set of available operators on @xmath81 to the set of two operators @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the identity operator and @xmath158 is the bit - flip pauli operator .",
    "this specification implies that for any mapping @xmath159 specified in ( [ sixtuple ] ) each strategy profile is an operator of the form @xmath160 , where @xmath161 .",
    "thus , for each strategy profile @xmath162 there is some @xmath163 such that @xmath164 let us fix a bijective mapping @xmath165 between @xmath166 and the set @xmath167 of all players information sets of @xmath50 . since for each player @xmath39 and history @xmath168 we have @xmath169 we can simply take @xmath170",
    ". then the correspondence @xmath171 associates each information set of each player with exactly one qubit .",
    "as @xmath172 and a number of information sets of @xmath50 is equal to a number of qubits , a set of strategies @xmath52 of the normal representation of @xmath50 and a strategy set @xmath173 of quantum game defined by the tuple ( [ sixtuple ] ) are equinumerous ( with cardinality equal @xmath174 each ) for each @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath35 , we can define a bijective mapping @xmath175 .",
    "these mappings induce the following bijection between the sets of strategy profiles : @xmath176 the equations in ( [ classicfin ] ) imply that for all @xmath39 we can select numbers @xmath177 in ( [ eformula ] ) in a way that @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the utility function of the normal representation of @xmath50 .",
    "such specification of ( [ sixtuple ] ) makes it isomorphic to the normal representation of @xmath50 .",
    "many researches on quantum games played via scheme ( [ fourtuple ] ) are based on appropriately fixed basis for a space , the initial state , and a range of available unitary operators , in order to obtain interesting properties of a quantum game .",
    "we will use the two best - known configurations of @xmath180 : the marinatto - weber ( mw ) scheme @xcite and the eisert - wilkens - lewenstein ( ewl ) scheme @xcite to examine extensive games via the protocol ( [ sixtuple ] ) ( see also @xcite and @xcite for other applications of these schemes ) . in the former scheme players",
    "are allowed to use only the identity operator and the bit - flip pauli operator .",
    "the results superior to classical results are obtained by manipulating the initial state @xmath125 .",
    "the later scheme allows to use broader range of unitary operators ( including also the whole set @xmath132 ) .",
    "the following examples concern both settings .    to convert the following games into quantum ones",
    ", we use the same reasoning as in the proof of proposition [ propositiondupa ] .",
    "the first example deals with a case where each player operates on one qubit .         + _ the mw approach . _     + _ the  ewl approach . _    [ example1 ]",
    "the second example is aimed at showing that the proposed scheme of playing extensive games based on the six - tuple ( [ sixtuple ] ) can be applied to extensive games in which some of players have more than one information set . unlike in example",
    "[ example1 ] we now focus only on converting an extensive game into the form described by ( [ sixtuple ] ) without considering a specific strategic situation .     + _ the ewl approach . _ + _ the mw approach . _",
    "we have shown that the six - tuple @xmath181 allows to study extensive games using quantum information language .",
    "although proposed scheme is suitable only for a normal representation in which some features of corresponding classical game in extensive form are lost , it yields on valuable information about how passing to quantum domain influences a course of extensive games .",
    "the examples we studied have shown that an extensive game played with the use of both the mw approach and the ewl approach substantially differs from this game played classically .",
    "furthermore , the quantum schemes may yield to the players significant advantages in the form of better strategic positions and pointing out reasonable solutions , as it often happens in the area of strategic games .",
