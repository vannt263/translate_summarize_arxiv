    "a number of striking phenomena have been observed in recent deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) experiments in the small-@xmath0 region . in particular",
    "it is seen , that the contribution of the gluons dominates@xcite , and that large - rapidity - gap ( lrg ) events exist@xcite .",
    "the latter shows that the virtual photons in such processes may encounter `` colorless objects '' originating from the proton .",
    "the existence of lrg events in these and other@xcite scattering processes have attracted much attention , and there has been much discussion @xcite on problems associated with the origin and/or the properties of such `` colorless objects '' .",
    "reactions in which `` exchange '' of such `` colorless objects '' dominate are known in the literature @xcite as `` diffractive scattering processes '' .",
    "while the concepts and methods used by different authors in describing such processes are in general very much different from one another , all the authors ( experimentalists as well as theorists ) seem to agree on the following@xcite ( see also refs . [ [ r2][r7 ] , [ r9][r10a ] ] ) : ( a ) interacting soft gluons play a dominating role in understanding the phenomena in the small-@xmath0 region of dis in general , and in describing the properties of lrg events in particular .",
    "( b ) perturbative qcd should be , and can be , used to describe the lrg events associated with high transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) jets which have been observed at hera@xcite and at the tevatron@xcite .",
    "such events are , however , rather rare . for the description of the bulk of lrg events , concepts and methods beyond the perturbative qcd , for example pomeron models@xcite based on regge phenomenology , are needed .",
    "it has been suggested a long time ago ( see the first two papers in ref.@xcite ) that , in the qcd language , `` pomeron - exchange '' can be interpreted as `` exchange of two or more gluons '' and that such results can be obtained by calculating the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "it is generally felt that non - perturbative methods should be useful in understanding `` the small - x phenomena '' , but the question , whether or how perturbative qcd plays a role in such non - perturbative approaches does not have an unique answer .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    ", we proposed that the `` colorless objects '' which play the dominating role in lrg events are color - singlet gluon - clusters due to self - organized criticality , and that optical - geometrical concepts and methods are useful in examing the space - time properties of such objects .",
    "the proposed picture @xcite is based on the following observation : in a system of soft gluons whose interactions are not negligible , gluons can be emitted and/or absorbed at any time and everywhere in the system due to color - interactions between the members of the system as well as due to color - interactions of the members with gluons and/or quarks and antiquarks outside the system . in this connection",
    "it is important to keep in mind that gluons interact directly with gluons and that _ the number of gluons in a system is not a conserved quantity_. furthermore , since in systems of interacting soft - gluons the `` running - coupling - constant '' is in general greater than unity , non - perturbation methods are needed to describe the local interactions associated with such systems .",
    "that is , such sytems are in general extremly complicated , they are not only too complicated ( at least for us ) to take the details of local interactions into account ( for example by describing the reaction mechanisms in terms of feynman diagrams ) , but also too complicated to apply well - known concepts and methods in conventional equilibrium statistical mechanics . in fact , the accumulated empirical facts about lrg events and the basic properties of gluons prescribed by the qcd are forcing us to accept the following picture for such systems :    a system of interacting soft gluons can be , and should be considered as _ an open dynamical complex system with many degrees of freedom _ , which is in general _ far from equilibrium_.    in our search for an appropriate method to deal with such complex systems , we are led to the following questions",
    ": do we see comparable complex systems in nature ?",
    "if yes , what are the characteristic features of such systems , and what can we learn by studying such systems ?",
    "open , dynamical , complex systems which are in general far from equilibrium are _ not _ difficult to find in nature  at least _ not _ in the macroscopic world !",
    "such systems have been studied , and in particular the following have been observed by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw ) some time ago@xcite : this kind of complex systems may evolve to self - organized critical states which lead to fluctuations extending over all length- and time - scales , and that such fluctuations manifest themselves in form of spatial and temporal power - law scaling behaviors showing properties associated with fractal structure and flicker noise respectively .    to be more precise , btw@xcite and many other authors@xcite proposed , and demonstrated by numerical simulations , the following : open dynamical complex systems of locally interacting objects which are in general far from equilibrium can evolve into self - organized structures of states which are barely stable . a local perturbation of a critical state may `` propagate '' , in the sense that it spreads to ( some ) nearest neighbors , and than to the next - nearest neighbors , and so on in a `` domino effect '' over all length scales , the size of such an `` avalanche '' can be as large as the entire system .",
    "such a `` domino effect '' eventually terminates after a total time @xmath2 , having reached a final amount of dissipative energy and having effected a total spatial extension @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is called by btw the `` size '' , and the quantity @xmath2 the `` lifetime '' of the avalanche  named by btw a `` cluster '' ( hereafter referred to as btw - cluster or btw - avalanche ) . as we shall see in more details later on , it is of considerable importance to note that a btw - cluster _ can not _ , and _ should not _ be identified with a cluster in the usual sense .",
    "it is an avalanche , _ not _ a _ static _ object with a fixed structure which remains unchanged until it decays after a time - interval ( known as the lifetime in the usual sense ) .",
    "in fact , it has been shown@xcite that the distribution ( @xmath4 ) of the `` size '' ( which is a measure of the dissipative energy , @xmath3 ) and the distribution ( @xmath5 ) of the lifetime ( @xmath2 ) of btw - clusters in such open dynamical complex systems obey power - laws : @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive real constants . such spatial and temporal power - law scaling behaviors can be , and have been , considered as the universal signals  the `` fingerprints ''  of the locally perturbed self - organized critical states in such systems .",
    "it is expected@xcite that the general concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , which is complementary to chaos , may be _ the _ underlying concept for temporal and spatial scaling in a wide class of _ open non - equilibrium complex systems _  although it is not yet known how the exponents of such power laws can be calculated analytically .",
    "soc has been observed in a large number of open dynamical complex systems in non - equilibrium@xcite among which the following examples are of particular interest , because they illuminate several aspects of soc which are relevant for the discussion in this paper .",
    "first , the well known gutenberg - richter law@xcite for earthquakes as a special case of eq.(1 ) : in this case , earthquakes are btw - clusters due to soc . here",
    ", @xmath3 stands for the released energy ( the magnitude ) of the observed earthquakes .",
    "@xmath10 is the number of earthquakes at which an energy @xmath3 is released .",
    "such a simple law is known to be valid for all earthquakes , large ( up to @xmath11 or @xmath12 in richter scale ) or small !",
    "we note , the power - law behavior given by the gutenberg - richter law implies in particular the following .",
    "the question `` how large is a typical earthquake ? '' does not make sense !",
    "second , the sandpile experiments@xcite which show the simple regularities mentioned in eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) : in this example , we see how local perturbation can be caused by the addition of one grain of sand ( note that we are dealing with an open system ! ) . here , we can also see how the propagation of perturbation in form of `` domino effect '' takes place , and develops into btw - clusters / avalanches of all possible sizes and durations .",
    "the size- and duration - distributions are given by eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",
    "this example is indeed a very attractive one , not only because such experiments can be , and have been performed in laboratories @xcite , but also because they can be readily simulated on a pc@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out , and demonstrated by simple models@xcite , that the concept of soc can also be applied to biological sciences .",
    "it is amazing to see how phenomena as complicated as life and evolution can be simulated by simple models such as the `` game of life''@xcite and the `` evolution model''@xcite .",
    "having seen that systems of interacting soft - gluons are open dynamical complex systems , and that a wide class of open systems with many degrees of freedom in the macroscopic world evolve to self - organized critical states which lead to fluctuations extending over all length- and time - scales , it seems natural to ask the following : can such states and such fluctuations also exist in the microscopic world  on the level of quarks and gluons ?",
    "in particular : can soc be the dynamical origin of color - singlet gluon - clusters which play the dominating role in inelastic diffractive scattering processes ?",
    "because of the special role played by `` the colorless objects '' in inelastic diffractive scattering , and the possible relations between such objects and color - singlet gluon - clusters which can be formed in systems of interacting soft gluons , it should be of considerable interest to study the questions mentioned at the end of the last section , as well as in the title of this section .",
    "a simple and effective way of answering them , is to check whether the characteristic properties of soc , in particular the soc-``fingerprints '' mentioned in eqs.([e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) show up in the relevant experiments . in order to perform such a comparison , we need to extract the spatial and the temporal distributions of the gluon - clusters .",
    "what _ are _ such `` colorless objects '' ?",
    "is it possible that the colorless objects which are associated with the proton - target and which play the dominating role in inelastic diffractive scattering processes are btw - clusters which exist due to soc in systems of interacting soft gluons ?",
    "can we examine the properties of such colorless objects by studying the final states of the above - mentioned scattering processes ?    to answer these questions",
    ", it is useful to recall the following : as color - singlets , such colorless objects can exist inside and/or outside the proton , and the interactions between such color - singlets as well as those between such objects and `` the mother proton '' should be of van der waals type .",
    "hence it is expected that such a colorless object can be readily separated as an entire object from the mother proton in scattering processes in which the momentum - transfer is sufficient to overcome the binding energy due to the van der waals type of interactions .",
    "this means , in inelastic diffractive scattering the beam - particle ( which is the virtual photon @xmath13 in dis ) should have a chance to encounter on of the color - singlet gluon - clusters . for the reasons mentioned above",
    ", the struck colorless object can simply be `` knocked out '' and/or `` carried away '' by the beam - particle in such a collision event .",
    "hence , it seems that the question whether `` the colorless objects '' are indeed btw - clusters is something that can be answered experimentally . in this connection",
    "we recall that , according to the general theory of soc@xcite , the size of a btw - cluster is characterized by its dissipative energy , and in case of systems of interacting soft gluons associated with the proton , the dissipative energy carried by the btw - cluster should be proportional to the energy fraction ( @xmath14 ) carried by the colorless object . hence ,",
    "if the colorless object can indeed be considered as a btw - cluster due to soc , we should be able to obtain information about the size - distribution of such color - singlet gluon - clusters by examing the @xmath14-distributions of lrg events in the small-@xmath0 region of dis .    having this in mind",
    ", we now take a closer look at the measured @xcite `` diffractive structure function '' . here , we note that @xmath15 is related @xcite to the differential cross - section for large - rapidity - gap events @xmath16 in analogy to the relationship between the corresponding quantities [ namely @xmath17 and @xmath18 for normal deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering events @xmath19 the kinematical variables , in particular @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath14 and @xmath0 ( in both cases ) are directly measurable quantities , the definitions of which are shown in fig.1 together with the corresponding diagrams of the scattering processes .",
    "we note that , although these variables are lorentz - invariants , it is sometimes convenient to interpret them in a `` fast moving frame '' , for example the electron - proton center - of - mass frame where the proton s 3-momentum @xmath22 is large ( i.e. its magnitude @xmath23 and thus the energy @xmath24 is much larger than the proton mass @xmath25 ) .",
    "while @xmath21 characterizes the virtuality of the space - like photon @xmath13 , @xmath0 can be interpreted , in such a `` fast moving frame '' ( in the framework of the celebrated parton model ) , as the fraction of proton s energy @xmath26 ( or longitudinal momentum @xmath23 ) carried by the struck charged constituent .",
    "we recall , in the framework of the parton model , @xmath27 @xmath28 for `` normal events '' can be interpreted as the sum of the probability densities for the above - mentioned @xmath13 to interact with a charged constituent of the proton . in analogy to this",
    ", the quantity @xmath29 for lrg events can be interpreted as the sum of the probability densities for @xmath13 to interact with a charged constituent which carries a fraction @xmath30 of the energy ( or longitudinal momentum ) of the colorless object , under the condition that the colorless object ( which we associate with a system of interacting soft gluons ) carries a fraction @xmath14 of proton s energy ( or longitudinal momentum ) .",
    "we hereafter denote this charged - neutral and color - neutral gluon - system by @xmath31 ( in regge pole models@xcite this object is known as the `` pomeron '' ) .",
    "hence , by comparing eq.(3 ) with eq.(4 ) and by comparing the two diagrams shown in fig.1(a ) and fig.1(b ) , it is tempting to draw the following conclusions :    the diffractive process is nothing else but a process in which the virtual photon @xmath13 encounters a @xmath32 , and @xmath20 is nothing else but the bjorken - variable with respect to @xmath32 ( this is why it is called @xmath33 in ref.[[r10 ] ] ) .",
    "this means , a diffractive @xmath34 scattering event can be envisaged as an event in which the virtual photon @xmath13 collides with `` a @xmath32-target '' instead of `` the proton - target '' .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath32 is charge - neutral , and a photon can only directly interact with an object which has electric charges and/or magnetic moments , it is tempting to assign @xmath32 an electro - magnetic structure function @xmath35 , and study the interactions between the virtual photon and the quark(s ) and antiquark(s ) inside @xmath32 . in such a picture ( which should be formally the same as that of regge pole models@xcite ,",
    "if we would replace the @xmath32 s by `` pomerons '' ) we are confronted with the following two questions :    first , is it possible and meaningful to discuss the @xmath14-distributions of the @xmath32 s without knowing the intrinsic properties , in particular the electromagnetic structures , of such objects ?",
    "second , are gluon - clusters hadron - like , such that their electromagnetic structures can be studied in the same way as those for ordinary hadrons ?",
    "since we wish to begin the quantitative discussion with something familiar to most of the readers in this community , and we wish to differentiate between the conventional - approach and the soc - approach , we would like to discuss the second question here , and leave the first question to the next section .",
    "we recall ( see in particular the last two papers in ref.[r7 ] ) , in order to see whether the second question can be answered in the _ affirmative _ , we need to know _ whether _ @xmath36 can be factorized in the form @xmath37 here , @xmath38 plays the role of a `` kinematical factor '' associated with the `` target @xmath32 '' , and @xmath14 is the fraction of proton s energy ( or longitudinal momentum ) carried by @xmath32 .",
    "[ we could call @xmath38 `` the @xmath32-flux ''  in exactly the same manner as in regge pole models@xcite , where it is called `` the pomeron flux '' . ]",
    "@xmath39 is `` the electro - magnetic structure function of @xmath32 '' [ the counterpart of @xmath40 of the proton ] which  in analogy to proton ( or any other hadron )  can be expressed as @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 stands for the probability density for @xmath13 to interact with a quark ( antiquark ) of flavor @xmath43 and electric charge @xmath44 which carries a fraction @xmath20 of the energy ( or longitudinal momentum ) of @xmath32 .",
    "it is clear that eq.(6 ) should be valid for all @xmath14-values in this kinematical region , that is , both the right- and the left - hand - side of eq.(6 ) should be independent of the energy ( momentum ) carried by the `` hadron '' @xmath32 .",
    "hence , to find out experimentally whether the second question can be answered in the affirmative , we only need to check whether the data are in agreement with the assumption that @xmath45 prescribed by eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) exists .",
    "for such a test , we take the existing data@xcite and plot @xmath46 $ ] against @xmath47 for different @xmath14-values .",
    "we note , under the assumption that the factorization shown in eq.(5 ) is valid , the @xmath20-dependence for a given @xmath21 in such a plot should have exactly the same form as that in the corresponding @xmath48 $ ] vs @xmath49 plot ; and that the latter is the analog of @xmath50 $ ] vs @xmath51 plot for normal events . in fig.2",
    "we show the result of such plots for three fixed @xmath21-values ( 3.5 , 20 and 65 gev@xmath52 , as representatives of three different ranges in @xmath21 ) .",
    "our goal is to examine whether or how the @xmath20-dependence of the function given in eq.(6 ) changes with @xmath14 . in principle , if there were enough data points , we should , and we could , do such a plot for the data - sets associated with every @xmath14-value .",
    "but , unfortunately there are not so much data at present . what we can do , however , is to consider the @xmath20-distributions in different @xmath14-bins , and to vary the bin - size of @xmath14 , so that we can explicitly see whether / how the shapes of the @xmath20-distributions change .",
    "the results are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the @xmath20-distribution in the first row , corresponds to the integrated value @xmath53 shown in the literature@xcite .",
    "those in the second and in the third row are obtained by considering different bins and/or by varying the sizes of the bins . by joining the points associated with a given @xmath14-interval in a plot for a given @xmath21",
    ", we obtain the @xmath20-distribution for a @xmath32 carrying approximately the amount of energy @xmath54 , encountered by a photon of virtuality @xmath21 . taken together with eq.(6 ) we can then extract the distributions @xmath55 and @xmath56 for this @xmath21-value , provided that @xmath57 is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "but , as we can see in fig.2 , the existing data@xcite show that the @xmath14-dependence of this function is far from being negligible ! note in particular that according to eq.([eee1 ] ) , by choosing a suitable @xmath58 we can shift the curves for different @xmath14-values in the vertical direction ( in this log - log plot ) ; but _ we can never change the shapes of the @xmath20-distributions _ which are different for different @xmath14-values !    in order to see , and to realize , the meaning of the @xmath14-dependence of the distributions of the charged constituents of @xmath31 expressed in terms of @xmath57 in lrg events [ see eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) ] , let us , for a moment , consider normal deep - inelastic scattering events in the @xmath0-region where quarks dominate ( @xmath59 , say ) .",
    "here we can plot the data for @xmath50 $ ] as a function of @xmath51 obtained at _ different incident energies ( @xmath26 s ) _ of the proton .",
    "_ suppose _ we see , that at a given @xmath21 , the data for @xmath0-distributions taken at different values of @xmath26 are very much different .",
    "_ would _ it still be possible to introduce @xmath40 as `` the electro - magnetic structure function '' of the proton , from which we can extract the @xmath0-distribution of the quarks @xmath60 at a given @xmath21 ? the fact that it is not possible to assign an @xmath14-independent structure function @xmath57 to @xmath32 which stands for the `` pomeron '' , and whose `` flux '' @xmath38 is expected to be independent of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , deserves to be taken seriously .",
    "it strongly suggest that the following picture _ can not _ be true :  there exists a universal colorless object ( call it pomeron or @xmath32 or something else ) the exchange of which describes diffractive scattering in general and dis off proton in particular .",
    "this object is hadron - like in the sense that it has not only a typical size and a typical lifetime , but also a typical electromagnetic structure which can e.g. be measured and described by an `` electromagnetic structure function '' .    in summary of this section",
    ", we note that the empirical facts mentioned above show that _ no _ energy - independent electromagnetic strcture function can be assigned to the expected universal colorless object @xmath32 .",
    "this piece of experimental fact is of considerable importance , because it is the first indication that , if there is a universal `` colorless object '' , this object _ can not _",
    "be considered as an ordinary hadron . in other words",
    ", it has to be something else !",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , this property is closely related to the observation that such an object _ can not _ have a typical size , or a typical lifetime .",
    "the final answer to the question mentioned in the title of this section will be presented in section [ sec:7 ] .",
    "after having seen that the existing data does not allow us to assign an energy - independent electromagnetic structure function to `` the colorless object '' such that the universal colorless object ( @xmath32 ) can be treated as an ordinary hadron , let us now come back to the first question in section [ sec:3 ] , and try to find out whether it is never - the - less possible , and meaningful , to talk about the @xmath14-distribution of @xmath32 . as we shall see in this section",
    ", the answer to this question is yes !",
    "furthermore , we shall also see , in order to answer this question in the affirmative , we _ do not _ need the factorization mentioned in eq.(5 ) , and we _ do not _ need to know whether the gluon - clusters are hadron - like .",
    "but , as we have already mentioned above , it is of considerable importance to discuss the second question so that we can understand the origin and the nature of the @xmath32 s .    in view of the fact that we do use the concept `` distributions of gluons '' in deep - inelastic lepton - hadron scattering , although the gluons do not directly interact with the virtual photons",
    ", we shall try to introduce the notion `` distribution of gluon - clusters '' in a similar manner . in order to see what we should do for the introduction of such distributions ,",
    "let us recall the following :    for normal deep - inelastic @xmath34 collision events , the structure function @xmath61 can be expressed in term of the distributions of partons , where the partons are not only quarks and antiquarks , but also gluons which can contribute to the structure function by quark - antiquark pair creation and annihilation .",
    "in fact , in order to satisfy energy - momentum - conservation ( in the electron - proton system ) , the contribution of the gluons @xmath62 has to be taken into account in the energy - momentum sum rule for all measured @xmath21-values . here , we denote by @xmath63 the probability density for the virtual photon @xmath13 ( with virtuality @xmath21 ) to meet a gluon which carries the energy ( momentum ) fraction @xmath64 of the proton , analogous to @xmath65 [ or @xmath66 which stands for the probability density for this @xmath13 to interact with a quark ( or an antiquark ) of flavor @xmath43 and electric charge @xmath44 which carries the energy ( momentum ) fraction @xmath0 of the proton .",
    "we note , while both @xmath0 and @xmath64 stand for energy ( or longitudinal momentum ) fractions carried by partons , the former can be , but the latter _ can not _ be directly measured .",
    "having these , in particular the energy - momentum sum rule in mind , we immediately see the following : in a given kinematical region in which the contributions of only one category of partons ( for example quarks for @xmath59 or gluons for @xmath67 ) dominate , the structure function @xmath40 can approximately be related to the distributions of that particular kind of partons in a very simply manner .",
    "in fact , the expressions below can be , and have been , interpreted as the probability - densities for the virtual photon @xmath13 ( with virtuality @xmath21 ) to meet a quark or a gluon which carries the energy ( momentum ) fraction @xmath0 or @xmath64 respectively .",
    "@xmath68    the relationship between @xmath60 , @xmath63 and @xmath61 as they stand in eq.([ee2 ] ) are general and formal ( this is the case especially for that between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) in the following sense : both @xmath65 and @xmath63 contribute to the energy - momentum sum rule and both of them are in accordance with the assumption that partons of a given category ( quarks or gluons ) dominate a given kinematical region ( here @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively ) .",
    "but , neither the dynamics which leads to the observed @xmath21-dependence nor the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath0 are given .",
    "this means , _ without further theoretical inputs _ , the simple expression for @xmath73 as given by eq.(7 ) is _ practically useless _ !",
    "having learned this , we now discuss what happens if we assume , in diffractive lepton - nucleon scattering , the colorless gluon - clusters ( @xmath32 s ) dominate the small-@xmath0 region ( @xmath74 , say ) . in this simple picture",
    ", we are assuming that the following is approximately true : the gluons in this region appear predominately in form of gluon clusters .",
    "the interaction between the struck @xmath32 and the rest of the proton can be neglected during the @xmath75-@xmath32 collision such that we can apply impuls - approximation to the @xmath32 s in this kinematical region .",
    "that is , here we can introduce  in the same manner as we do for other partons ( see eq.[ee2 ] ) , a probability density @xmath76 for @xmath13 in the diffractive scattering process to `` meet '' a @xmath32 which carries the fraction @xmath14 of the proton s energy @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is the momentum and @xmath25 is the mass of the proton ) . in other words , in diffractive scattering events for processes in the kinematical region",
    "@xmath67 , we should have , instead of @xmath63 , the following : @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the energy carried by @xmath32 , and @xmath20 indicates the corresponding fraction carried by the struck charged constituent in @xmath32 . in connection with the similarities and the differences between @xmath60 , @xmath81 in ( [ ee2 ] ) and @xmath82 in ( [ ee3 ] ) , it is useful to note in particular the significant difference between @xmath64 and @xmath14 , and thus that between the @xmath64-distribution @xmath63 of the gluons and the @xmath14-distribution @xmath82 of the @xmath31 s : both @xmath64 and @xmath14 are energy ( longitudinal momentum ) fractions of charge - neutral objects , with which @xmath13 _ can not _ directly interact .",
    "but , in contrast to @xmath64 , @xmath14 _ can be directly measured in experiments _ , namely by making use of the kinematical relation @xmath83 and by measuring the quantities @xmath21 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 in every collision event . here , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 stand respectively for the invariant momentum - transfer from the incident electron , the invariant - mass of the final hadronic state after the @xmath89 collision , and the invariant mass of the entire hadronic system in the collision between @xmath13 and the proton .",
    "note that @xmath90 , hence @xmath20 is also measurable .",
    "this means , in sharp contrast to @xmath63 , _ experimental information _ on @xmath82 in particular its @xmath14-dependence can be obtained  _ without further theoretical inputs _ !",
    "we mentioned at the beginning of section [ sec:3 ] , that in order to find out whether the concept of soc indeed plays a role in diffractive dis we need to check the fingerprints of soc shown in section [ sec:2 ] , and that such tests can be made by examing the corresponding cluster - distributions obtained from experimental data .",
    "we are now ready to do this , because we have learned in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , that it is not only meaningful but also possible to extract @xmath14-distributions from the measured diffractive structure functions , although the gluon - clusters _ can not _ be treated as hadrons .",
    "in fact , as we can explicitly see in eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) , in order to extract the @xmath14-dependence of the gluon - clusters from the data , detailed knowledge about the intrinsic structure of the clusters are not necessary .    having these in mind , we now consider @xmath4 as a function of @xmath14 for given values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and plot @xmath91 against @xmath14 for different sets of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the results of such log - log plots are shown in fig .",
    "3 . as we can see ,",
    "the data@xcite suggest that the probability - density for the virtual photon @xmath13 to meet a color - neutral and charged - neutral object @xmath32 with energy ( longitudinal momentum ) fraction @xmath14 has a power - law behavior in @xmath14 , and the exponent of this power - law depends very little on @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is to be compared with @xmath10 in eq .",
    "(  [ e1 ] ) , where @xmath3 , the dissipative energy ( the size of the btw - cluster ) corresponds to the energy of the system @xmath32 .",
    "the latter is @xmath80 , where @xmath26 is the total energy of the proton .",
    "it means , the existing data@xcite show that @xmath92 exhibits the same kind of power - law behavior as the size - distribution of btw - clusters .",
    "this result is in accordance with the expectation that self - organized critical phenomena may exist in the colorless systems of interacting soft gluons in diffractive deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering processes .",
    "we note , up to now , we have only argued ( in section [ sec:1 ] ) that such gluon - systems are open , dynamical , complex systems in which soc may occur , and we have mentioned ( in section [ sec:2 ] ) the ubiquitousness of soc in nature .",
    "having seen the experimental evidence that one of the `` soc - fingerprints '' ( which are necessary conditions for the existence of soc ) indeed exists , let us now take a second look at the colorless gluon - systems from a theoretical standpoint .",
    "viewed from a `` fast moving frame '' which can for example be the electron - proton c.m.s .",
    "frame , such colorless systems of interacting soft gluons are part of the proton ( although , as color - singlets , they can also be outside the confinement region ) .",
    "soft gluons can be intermittently emitted or absorbed by gluons in such a system , as well as by gluons , quarks and antiquarks outside the system .",
    "the emission- and absorption - processes are due to local interactions prescribed by the well - known qcd - lagrangian ( here `` the running coupling constants '' are in general large , because the distances between the interacting colored objects can not be considered as `` short '' ; remember that the spatial dimension of a @xmath32 can be much larger than that of a hadron ! ) . in this connection , it is useful to keep the following in mind : due to the complexity of the system , details about the local interactions may be relatively unimportant , while general and/or global features  for example energy - flow between different parts ( neighbors and neighbor s neighbors @xmath93 ) of the system  may play an important role .",
    "how far can one go in neglecting dynamical details when one deals with such open complex systems ? in order to see this , let us recall how bak and sneppen@xcite succeeded in modeling some of the essential aspects of the evolution in nature .",
    "they consider the `` fitness '' of different `` species '' , related to one another through a `` food chain '' , and assumed that the species with the lowest fitness is most likely to disappear or mutate at the next time - step in their computer simulations . the crucial step in their simulations that _ drives _ evolution is the adaption of the individual species to its present _ environment _ ( neighborhood ) through mutation and selection of a fitter variant .",
    "other interacting species form part of the _ environment_.",
    "this means , the neighbors will be influenced by every time - step .",
    "the result these authors obtained strongly suggests that the process of evolution is a self - organized critical phenomenon .",
    "one of the essential simplifications they made in their evolution models@xcite is the following : instead of the explicit connection between the fitness and the configuration of the genetic codes , they use random numbers for the fitness of the species .",
    "furthermore , as they have pointed out in their papers , they could in principle have chosen to model evolution on a less coarse - grained scale by considering mutations at the individual level rather than on the level of species , but that would make the computation prohibitively difficult .    having these in mind ,",
    "we are naturally led to the questions : can we consider the creation and annihilation processes of colorless systems of interacting soft gluons associated with a proton as `` evolution '' in a microscopic world ? before we try to build models for a quantitative description of the data ,",
    "can we simply apply the existing evolution models@xcite to such open , dynamical , complex systems of interacting soft - gluons , and check whether some of the essential features of such systems can be reproduced ?    to answer these questions , we now report on the result of our first trial in this direction : based on the fact that we know _ very little _ about the detailed reaction mechanisms in such gluon - systems and _ practically _ _ nothing _ about their structures , we simply _ ignore _ them , and assume that they are self - similar in space ( this means , colorless gluon - clusters can be considered as clusters of colorless gluon - clusters and so on ) . next , we divide them in an arbitrary given number of subsystems @xmath94 ( which may or may not have the same size ) . such a system is open , in the sense that neither its energy @xmath95 , nor its gluon - number @xmath96 has a fixed value .",
    "since we do not know , in particular , how large the @xmath95 s are , we use random numbers .",
    "as far the @xmath96 s are concerned , since we do not know how these numbers are associated with the energies in the subsystems @xmath94 , except that they are not conserved quantities , we just ignore them , and consider only the @xmath95 s . as in ref.[[r16 ] ] or in ref.[[r17 ] ] , the random number of this subsystem as well as those of the fixed@xcite or random ( see the first paper of ref.[[r17 ] ] ) neighbors will be changed at every time - step .",
    "note , this is how we simulate the processes of energy flow due to exchange of gluons between the subsystems , as well as those with gluons / quarks / antiquarks outside the system . in other words , in the spirit of bak and sneppen@xcite we neglecting the dynamical details _",
    "totally_. having in mind that , in such systems , the gluons as well as the subsystems ( @xmath94 s ) of gluons are _ virtual _ ( space - like ) , we can ask : `` how long can such a colorless subsystem @xmath94 of interacting soft gluons exist , which carries energy @xmath95 ? '' according to the uncertainty principle , the answer should be : `` the time interval in which the subsystem @xmath94 can exist is proportional to @xmath97 , and this quantity can be considered as the lifetime @xmath98 of @xmath94 . '' in this sense , the subsystems of colorless gluons are expected to have larger probabilities to mutate because they are associated with higher energies , and thus shorter `` lifetimes '' . note that the basic local interaction in this self - organized evolution process is the emission ( or absorption ) of gluons by gluons prescribed by the qcd - lagrangian  although the detailed mechanisms ( which can in principle be explicitly written down by using the qcd - lagrangian ) do not play a significant role .    in terms of the evolution",
    "model@xcite we now call @xmath94 the `` species '' and identify the corresponding lifetime @xmath98 as the `` fitness of @xmath94 '' . because of the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath98 and @xmath95 , where the latter is a random number , we can also directly assign random numbers to the @xmath98 s instead . from now",
    "we can adopt the evolution model@xcite and note that , at the start of such a process ( a simulation ) , the fitness on average grow , because the least fit are always eliminated . eventually the fitness do not grow any further on average .",
    "all gluons have a fitness above some threshold . at the next step , the least fit species ( i.e. the most energetic subsystem @xmath94 of interacting soft gluons ) , which would be right at the threshold , will be `` replaced '' and starts an avalanche ( or punctuation of mutation events ) , which is causally connected with this triggering `` replacement '' . after a while",
    ", the avalanche will stop , when all the fitnesses again will be over that threshold . in this sense",
    ", the evolution goes on , and on , and on . as in refs.[[r16 ] ] and [ [ r17 ] ] , we can monitor the duration of every avalanche , that is the total number of mutation events in everyone of them , and count how many avalanches of each size are observed .",
    "the avalanches mentioned here are special cases of those discussed in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "their size- and lifetime - distributions are given by eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) respectively .",
    "note in particular that the avalanches in the bak - sneppen model correspond to sets of subsystems @xmath94 , the energies ( @xmath99 ) of which are too high `` to be fit for the colorless systems of low - energy gluons '' .",
    "it means , in the proposed picture , what the virtual photon in deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering `` meet '' are those `` less fit '' one  those who carry `` too much '' energy . in a geometrical picture",
    "this means , it is more probable for such `` relatively energetic '' colorless gluons - clusters to be spatially further away from the ( confinement region of ) the proton .",
    "there exists , in the mean time , already several versions of evolution models@xcite based on the original idea of bak and sneppen@xcite although soc phenomena have been observed in all these cases@xcite , the slopes of the power - law distributions for the avalanches are different in different models  depending on the rules applied to the mutations . the values range from approximately @xmath100 to approximately @xmath101 .",
    "furthermore , these models@xcite seem to show that neither the size nor the dimension of the system used for the computer simulation plays a significant role .    hence , if we identify the colorless charge - neutral object @xmath32 encountered by the virtual photon @xmath13 with such an avalanche , we are identifying the lifetime of @xmath32 with @xmath2 , and the `` size '' ( that is the total amount of dissipative energy in this `` avalanche '' ) with the total amount of energy of @xmath32 .",
    "note that the latter is nothing else but @xmath80 , where @xmath26 is the total energy of the proton .",
    "this is how and why the @xmath3-distribution in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and the @xmath14-distribution of @xmath76 in eq.([ee3 ] ) are related to each other .",
    "in this section we discuss in more detail the effects associated with the time - degree - of - freedom . in this connection ,",
    "some of the concepts and methods related to the two questions raised in section [ sec:3 ] are of great interest .",
    "in particular , one may wish to know _",
    "why _ the parton - picture does not work equally well for hadrons and for gluon - clusters .",
    "the answer is very simple : the time - degree of freedom can not be ignored when we apply impulse - approximation , and the applicability of the latter is the basis of the parton - model .",
    "we recall that , when we apply the parton model to stable hadrons , the quarks , antiquarks and gluons are considered as free and stable objects , while the virtual photon @xmath13 is associated with a given interaction - time @xmath102 characterized by the values @xmath21 and @xmath0 of such scattering processes .",
    "we note however that , this is possible only when the interaction - time @xmath103 is much shorter than the corresponding time - scales related to hadron - structure ( in particular the average propagation - time of color - interactions in hadron ) . having these in mind",
    ", we see that , we are confronted with the following questions when we deal with gluon - clusters which have finite lifetimes : can we consider the @xmath32 s as `` _ free _ '' and `` _ stable _ '' particles when their lifetimes are _ shorter _ than the interaction - time @xmath104 ?",
    "can we say that a @xmath13-@xmath32 collision process takes place , in which the incident @xmath13 is absorbed by one a or a system of the charged constituents of @xmath32 , when the lifetime @xmath2 of @xmath32 is _ shorter _ than @xmath102 ?    since the notion `` stable objects '' or `` unstable objects '' depends on the scale which is used in the measurement , the question whether a @xmath32 can be considered as a parton ( in the sense that it can be considered as a free `` stable object '' during the @xmath13-@xmath32 interaction ) depends very much on on the interaction - time @xmath105 . here ,",
    "for given values of @xmath21 , @xmath0 , and thus @xmath105 , only those @xmath31 s whose lifetime ( @xmath2 s ) are greater than @xmath105 can absorb the corresponding @xmath13 .",
    "that is to say , when we consider diffractive electron - proton scattering in kinematical regions in which @xmath32 s dominate , we must keep in mind that the measured cross - sections ( and thus the diffractive structure function @xmath106 ) only include contributions from collision - events in which the condition @xmath107 is satisfied !",
    "we note that @xmath103 can be estimated by making use of the uncertainty principle .",
    "in fact , by calculating @xmath108 in the above - mentioned reference frame , we obtain @xmath109 which implies that , for given @xmath23 and @xmath21 values , @xmath110 this means , for diffractive @xmath34 scattering events in the small-@xmath0 region at given @xmath111 and @xmath21 values , @xmath0 is directly proportional to the interaction time @xmath103 . taken together with the relationship between @xmath103 and the minimum lifetime @xmath112 of the @xmath32 s mentioned above , we reach the following conclusion : the distribution of this minimum value , @xmath113 of the @xmath32 s which dominate the small-@xmath0 ( @xmath72 , say ) region can be obtained by examining the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath29 discussed in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and in fig .",
    "this is because , due to the fact that this function is proportional to the quark ( antiquark ) distributions @xmath114 which can be directly probed by the incident virtual photon @xmath13 , by measuring @xmath115 as a function of @xmath116 , we are in fact asking the following questions : do the distributions of the charged constituents of @xmath32 depend on the interaction time @xmath103 , and thus on the minimum lifetime @xmath113 of the to be detected gluon - clusters ?",
    "we use the identity @xmath90 and plot the quantity @xmath29 against the variable @xmath0 for fixed values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the result of such a log - log plot is given in fig.4 .",
    "it shows not only how the dependence on the time - degree - of - freedom can be extracted from the existing data@xcite , but also that , for all the measured values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the quantity @xmath117 is approximately independent of @xmath20 , and independent of @xmath21 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the quantity given in eq.([e5 ] ) is associated with some _ global _ features of @xmath32  consistent with the observation made in section [ sec:3 ] which shows that it _ can not _",
    "be used to describe the _ structure _ of @xmath32 .",
    "this piece of empirical fact can be expressed by setting @xmath118 . by taking a closer look at this @xmath119-@xmath119 plot , as well as the corresponding plots for different sets of fixed @xmath20- and @xmath21-values (",
    "such plots are not shown here , they are similar to those in fig.3 ) , we see that they are straight lines indicating that @xmath120 obeys a power - law .",
    "what does this piece of experimental fact tell us ?",
    "what can we learn from the distribution of the lower limit of the lifetimes ( of the gluon - systems @xmath32 s ) ?    in order to answer these questions , let us , for a moment , assume that we know the lifetime - distribution @xmath121 of the @xmath32 s .",
    "in such a case , we can readily evaluate the integral @xmath122\\equiv\\int^\\infty_{\\tau_{\\rm int}(x_b)}d_t(t)dt,\\ ] ] and thus obtain the number density of all those clusters which live longer than the interaction time @xmath123 .",
    "hence , under the statistical assumption that the chance for a @xmath13 to be absorbed by one of those @xmath32 s of lifetime @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath121 ( provided that @xmath124 , otherwise this chance is zero ) , we can then interpret the integral in eq.(13 ) as follows : @xmath125\\propto p(x_b)$ ] is the probability density for @xmath13 [ associated with the interaction - time @xmath123 ] to be absorbed by @xmath32 s .",
    "hence , @xmath127 this means in particular , the fact that @xmath120 obeys a power - law in @xmath0 implies that @xmath121 obeys a power - law in @xmath2 .",
    "such a _ behavior is similar _ to that shown in eq .",
    "(  [ e2 ] ) . in order to see the _ quality _ of this power - law behavior of @xmath5 , and the _ quality _ of its independence of @xmath21 and @xmath20",
    ", we compare the above - mentioned behavior with the existing data@xcite . in fig.5",
    ", we show the log - log plots of @xmath128 $ ] against @xmath0 .",
    "we note that @xmath128 $ ] is approximately @xmath129 . the quality of the power - law behavior of @xmath5 is explicitly shown in fig.5 .",
    "we have seen , in sections [ sec:5 ] and [ sec:6 ] , that in diffractive deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering , the size- and the lifetime - distributions of the gluon - clusters obey power - laws , and that the exponents depend very little on the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we interpreted the power - law behaviors as the fingerprints of soc in the formation processes of such clusters in form of btw - avalanches .",
    "can such approximately independence ( or weak dependence ) of the exponents on @xmath21 and @xmath20 be understood in a physical picture based on soc ?",
    "in particular , what do we expect to see in photoproduction processes where the associated value for @xmath21 is zero ?    in order to answer these questions ,",
    "let us recall the space - time aspects of the collision processes which are closely related to the above - mentioned power - law behaviors .",
    "viewed in a fast moving frame ( e.g. the c.m.s . of the colliding electron and proton ) , the states of the interacting soft gluons originating from the proton are self - organized .",
    "the colorless gluon - clusters caused by local perturbations and developed through `` domino effects '' are btw - avalanches ( see sections [ sec:1 ] and [ sec:5 ] ) , the size - distribution of which [ see eqs.(8 ) and ( 1 ) ] are given by fig.3 .",
    "this explicitly shows that there are gluon - clusters of all sizes , because a power - law size - distribution implies that there is no scale in size .",
    "recall that , since such clusters are color - singlets , their spatial extensions can be much larger than that of the proton , and thus they can be `` seen '' also _ outside _ the proton by a virtual photon originating from the electron .",
    "in other words , what the virtual photon encounters is a cloud of colorless gluon - clusters everyone of which is in general partly inside and partly outside the proton .",
    "the virtual photon , when it encounters a colorless gluon - cluster , will be absorbed by the charged constituents ( quarks and antiquarks due to fluctuation of the gluons ) of the gluon - system .",
    "here it is useful to recall that in such a space - time picture , @xmath21 is inversely proportional to the transverse size , and @xmath0 is a measure of the interaction time [ see eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in section [ sec:6 ] ] of the virtual photon .",
    "it is conceivable , that the values for the cross - sections for virtual photons ( associated with a given @xmath21 and a given @xmath0 ) to collide with gluon - clusters ( of a given size and a given lifetime ) may depend on these variables .",
    "but , since the processes of self - organization ( which produce such gluon - clusters ) take place independent of the virtual photon ( which originates from the incident electron and enters `` the cloud '' to look for suitable partners ) , the power - law behaviors of the size- and lifetime - distributions of the gluon - clusters are expected to be independent of the properties associated with the virtual photon .",
    "this means , by using @xmath13 s associated with different values of @xmath21 to detect clusters of various sizes , we are moving up or down on the straight lines in the log - log plots for the size- and lifetime distributions , the slopes of which do not change . in other words ,",
    "the approximative @xmath21-independence of the slope is a natural consequence of the soc picture .",
    "as far as the @xmath20-dependence is concerned , we recall the results obtained in sections [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , which explicitly show the following : the gluon - clusters ( @xmath32 s ) _ can not _ be considered as _",
    "hadrons_. in particular , it is neither possible nor meaningful to talk about `` the electro - magnetic structure of the gluon - cluster '' .",
    "this suggests , by studying the @xmath20-dependence of the `` diffractive structure functions '' we can not expect to gain further information about the structure of the gluon - clusters or further insight about the reaction mechanisms .",
    "having seen these , we try to look for measurable quantities in which the integrations over @xmath20 have already been carried out . a suitable candidate for this purpose",
    "is the differential cross - section @xmath130 together with eqs.(3 ) and ( 8) , we see that this cross - section is nothing else but the effective @xmath20-weighted @xmath14-distribution @xmath131 of the gluon - clusters . note that the weighting factors shown on the right - hand - side of eq.(15 ) are simply results of qed !",
    "next , we use the data@xcite for @xmath106 which are available at present , to do a log - log plot for the integrand of the expression in eq.(15 ) as a function of @xmath14 for different values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is shown in in fig.6a . since the absolute values of this quantity",
    "depend very much , but the slope of the curves very little on @xmath20 , we carry out the integration as follows : we first fit every set of the data separately . having obtained the slopes and the intersection points , we use the obtained fits to perform the integration over @xmath20 . the results are shown in the @xmath132 plots of fig.6b .",
    "these results show the @xmath21-dependence of the slopes is practically negligible , and that the slope is approximately @xmath133 for all values of @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , in order to see whether the quantity introduced in eq.(15 ) is indeed useful , and in order to perform a decisive test of the @xmath21-independence of the slope in the power - law behavior of the above - mentioned size - distributions , we now compare the results in deep - inelastic scattering@xcite with those obtained in photoproduction@xcite , where lrg events have also be observed .",
    "this means , as in diffractive deep - inelastic scattering , we again associate the observed effects with colorless objects which are interpreted as system of interacting soft gluons originating from the proton . in order to find out whether it is the same kind of gluon - clusters as in deep - inelastic scattering , and whether they `` look '' very much different when we probe them with real ( @xmath134 ) photons , we replot the existing @xmath135 data@xcite for photoproduction experiments performed at different total energies , and note the kinematical relationship between @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath14 ( for @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) : @xmath138 the result of the corresponding @xmath139 plot",
    "is shown in fig.7 .",
    "the slope obtained from a least - square fit to the existing data@xcite is @xmath140 .",
    "the results obtained in diffractive deep - inelastic electron - proton scattering and that for diffractive photoproduction strongly suggest the following : the formation processes of gluon - clusters in the proton is due to self - organized criticality , and thus the spatial distributions of such clusters  represented by the @xmath14-distribution  obey power - laws .",
    "the exponents of such power - laws are independent of @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath141 can be interpreted as a measure for the transverse size of the incident virtual photon , the observed @xmath21-independence of the exponents can be considered as further evidence for soc  in the sense that the self - organized gluon - cluster formation processes take place independent of the photon which is `` sent in '' to detect the clusters .",
    "having these results , and the close relationship between real photon and hadron in mind , we are immediately led to the following questions : what shall we see , when we replace the ( virtual or real ) photon by a hadron  a proton or an antiproton ?",
    "( see in this connection fig.8 , for the notations and the kinematical relations for the description of such scattering processes . )",
    "should we not see similar behaviors , if soc in gluon - systems is indeed the reason for the occurrence of colorless gluon - clusters which can be probed experimentally in inelastic diffractive scattering processes ? to answer these questions",
    ", we took a closer look at the available single diffractive proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering data@xcite ; and in order to make quantitative comparisons , we plot the quantities which correspond to those shown in fig.[figure6]b and fig.[figure7 ] . these plots are shown in fig.[figure9]a and fig.[figure9]b .",
    "in fig.[figure9]a , we see the double differential cross - section @xmath142 at four different @xmath143-values . in fig.[figure9]b , we see the integrated differential cross - section @xmath144 . note that , here @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the total c.m.s . energy of the colliding proton - proton or antiproton - proton system . here , the integrations of the double differential cross - section over @xmath143 are in the ranges in which the corresponding experiments have been performed .",
    "( the extremely weak energy - dependence has been ignored in the integration . ) the dashed lines in all the plots in figs.[figure9]a and [ figure9]b stand for the slope @xmath147 which is the average of the slope obtained from the plots shown in figs.[figure6]b and [ figure7 ] .",
    "this means , the result shows exactly what we expect to see : the fingerprints of soc can be clearly seen also in proton- and antiproton - induced inelastic diffractive scattering processes , showing that such characteristic features are indeed universal and robust !    we are thus led to the following conclusions .",
    "color - singlet gluon - clusters can be formed in hadrons as a consequence of self - organized criticality ( soc ) in systems of interacting soft gluons . in other words , `` the colorless objects '' which dominate the inelastic diffractive scattering processes are btw - avalanches ( btw - clusters ) .",
    "such color - singlet gluon - clusters are in general distributed partly inside and partly outside the confinement region of the `` mother - hadron '' .",
    "since the interactions between the color - singlet gluon - clusters and other color singlet objects ( including the target proton ) should be of van der waals type , it is expected that such an object can be readily driven out of the above - mentioned confinement region by the beam - particle in geometrically more peripheral collisions .",
    "this is why we examined inelastic single - diffractive scattering processes at high energies in which virtual photon , real photon , proton , and antiproton are used as beam particles .",
    "this is also why we can extract the universal distributions of such color - singlet gluon - clusters directly from the data . in particular",
    ", the fact that @xmath14 is the energy fraction carried by the struck colorless gluon - cluster , and the fact that the @xmath14-distributions are universal , it is tempting to regard such @xmath14-distributions as `` the parton - distributions '' for diffractive scattering processes .",
    "can we make use of such `` parton - distributions '' to describe and/or to predict the measurable cross - sections in inelastic diffractive scattering processes ? this and other related questions will be discussed in part ii of the present paper .",

    "<S> it is proposed , that color - singlet gluon - clusters can be formed in hadrons as a consequence of self - organized criticality ( soc ) in systems of interacting soft gluons , and that the properties of such spatiotemporal complexities can be probed experimentally by examing inelastic diffractive scattering . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical arguments and experimental evidences supporting the proposed picture are presented  together with the result of a systematic analysis of the existing data for inelastic diffractive scattering processes performed at different incident energies , and/or by using different beam - particles . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the size- and the lifetime - distributions of such gluon - clusters can be directly extracted from the data , and the obtained results exhibit universal power - law behaviors  in accordance with the expected soc - fingerprints . </S>"
