    "remarkable advances in nanotechnology have enabled us to fabricate different semiconductor superlattices and optical lattice systems which are promising candidates to simulate and investigate a lot of rich and exotic quantum phenomena in condensed matter physics e.g. , quantum hall effect ( qhe )  @xcite , spin hall effect ( she )  @xcite , manifestation of topological insulators  @xcite , etc . unlike the bulk materials , the quantum dot superlattice systems with different geometry are easier to design by nanolithography technique and the controllability of electron filling in such lattice systems is possible by applying a gate voltage  @xcite .",

    "kagome lattice structure occupies a very special position because of its fascinating property of having a ferromagnetic ground state at zero temperature where the single particle energy spectra have a complete dispersionless flat band in the tight - binding approximation .    in 1993",
    ", mielke and tasaki  @xcite have investigated that the coulomb interaction between the degenerate electronic states induces ferromagnetism at zero temperature , when the flat band is half - filled with electrons . in 2002 , kimura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the flat band is completely destroyed by the application of a perpendicular magnetic field , and by calculating the drude weight ( d ) in a closed system with hubbard interaction they have predicted that the magnetic field can induce a metal - insulator as well as a ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic transition .",
    "ishii and nakayama in 2004 have shown that the exitonic binding energy of a kagome lattice is larger than other two - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) or even one - dimensional ( @xmath1d ) lattices because of the macroscopic degree of degeneracy and the localized nature of the flat band states  @xcite , in contrast to the concept that exitonic binding energy in spatially higher dimension is smaller than those of spatially lower dimension . to elucidate the transport properties of such unique flat band electronic states , ishii and nakayama again in 2006 ,",
    "have studied electron transport through a kagome    lattice chain , in presence of an in - plane electric field  @xcite . they have observed a large current peak arising from electronic transmission through the flat band states when the electric field is applied in perpendicular direction to the kagome chain , while no current is observed when the field is applied along the chain .",
    "these anisotropic features are the outcome of the itinerant and localized characteristics of the flat band like states which are originated due to quantum interference effect and are largely sensitive to the external perturbations like magnetic field or electric field .",
    "these are the motivation of our present work where we investigate two - terminal quantum transport through a finite size kagome lattice ribbon in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field using green s function technique  @xcite within landauer - bttiker formalism  @xcite . following an analytical description , in presence of the magnetic field , of a kagome lattice nanoribbon we study numerically the transmittance spectra together with the density of states ( dos ) and current - voltage ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) characteristics .",
    "most interestingly we notice that the current - voltage characteristics reflect the feature of insulator - to - metal transition , when the equilibrium fermi level @xmath4 is fixed at the flat band i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 being the nearest - neighbor hopping strength and the magnetic flux is switched from zero to a non - zero one .",
    "again , a similar but reverse transition takes place when the electron filling is set at @xmath7 i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . with a brief introduction and motivation ( section i ) , in section",
    "ii , we describe the model and theoretical formulation to determine the transmission probability , dos and current through the nanostructure .",
    "the analytical and numerical results are illustrated in section iii .",
    "finally , in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "we start with fig  [ kagomeribbon ] , where a finite width kagome lattice ribbon , subject to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath9 , is attached to two semi - infinite multi - channel leads , commonly known as source and drain .",
    "these leads are characterized by the electrochemical potentials @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , under the non - equilibrium condition when an external bias voltage is applied .",
    "both the leads have almost the same cross section as the sample to reduce the effect of the scattering induced by wide - to - narrow geometry at the sample - lead interface .",
    "the whole system is described within a single electron picture by a simple tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor hopping approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian representing the entire system can be written as a sum of three terms , @xmath12 the first term represents the hamiltonian for the kagome lattice ribbon which is coupled to two electron reservoirs through conducting leads i.e. , source and drain . in wannier basis the hamiltonian of the ribbon in non - interacting picture reads as , @xmath13 \\label{eqn2}\\ ] ] where , @xmath14 refers to the site energy of an electron at each site of the kagome ribbon and @xmath15 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor hopping integral between the sites in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the effect of magnetic field @xmath9 ( @xmath16 ) is incorporated in the hopping term @xmath15 through the peierl s phase factor and for a chosen gauge field it becomes , @xmath17 where , @xmath6 gives the nearest - neighbor hopping integral in the absence of magnetic filed and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the elementary flux quantum .",
    "the specific choice of the gauge field in this case and the exact    calculation of the peierl s phase factor has been discussed in the sub - sequent section .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an electron at the site @xmath22 of the nanoribbon .",
    "the second and third terms of eq .",
    "[ eqn1 ] describe the t - b hamiltonians for the multi - channel semi - infinite leads and sample - to - lead coupling . in",
    "wannier basis they can be written as follows .",

    "the hopping integral between the boundary sites of the lead and the sample is parametrized by @xmath30 .",
    "let us now evaluate @xmath15 incorporating the peierl s phase factor .",
    "we choose the gauge for the vector potential @xmath31 associated with the magnetic field @xmath9 ( @xmath32 ) , perpendicular to the lattice plane , in the form , @xmath33 this specific choice is followed from a literature  @xcite , and the purpose of doing so is solely due to the simplification of the factor @xmath34 along various paths of the ribbon .    with this particular choice of gauge , we determine @xmath15 for the three different types of paths of the ribbon through which an electron can hop in the following ways .",
    "0.25 cm @xmath35 first , we consider the hopping along the @xmath36 axis ( see fig .  [ kagome1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", our choice of gauge ensures that the component of @xmath31 along @xmath36    axis is zero i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "so , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 when an electron hops along the @xmath36 axis , either along the @xmath40 , @xmath41 or its parallel direction .",
    "0.25 cm @xmath42 here , we consider the hopping along the @xmath43 ( @xmath44ve for forward hopping and @xmath45ve for backward hopping ) direction only . in this case @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the lattice spacing .",
    "now , for @xmath48 line , @xmath49 , and therefore , @xmath39 . for the line @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and",
    "hence , @xmath52 . if we set @xmath53 , the flux enclosed by the smallest triangle ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ kag ] ) , then for the line @xmath50 , @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , in general , we can write the hopping term for @xmath29-th line as , @xmath55 where , @xmath56 .    0.25 cm @xmath57 finally , we consider the case where electrons hop along the direction from site @xmath0 to site @xmath58 and all its parallel directions . in this case , @xmath59 it can be shown by straightforward calculation that for an upward pointing triangle ( shown in fig .",
    "[ kag ] ) the modified hopping strengths are given by , @xmath60 the value of @xmath29 belongs to the base line of the triangle .",

    "[ kag ] ) the modified hopping integrals can be written as , @xmath61 here , @xmath62 , as for a downward pointing triangle the sites @xmath22 and @xmath63 do not belong to the same value of @xmath29 .      to obtain the transmission probability of an electron through such a bridge system ,",
    "we use green s function formalism . within the regime of coherent transport and in the absence of coulomb interaction",
    "this technique is well applied .",
    "the single particle green s function operator representing the entire system for an electron with energy @xmath64 is defined as , @xmath65 where , @xmath66 .",

    "[ eqn8 ] that the form of the self - energies are independent of the conductor itself through which transmission is studied .",

    "@xcite that the self - energy can be expressed as a linear combination of a real and an imaginary part in the form , @xmath75 the real part of self - energy describes the shift of the energy levels and the imaginary part corresponds to the broadening of the levels .",
    "the finite imaginary part appears due to incorporation of the semi - infinite leads having continuous energy spectrum .",
    "therefore , the coupling matrices can easily be obtained from the self - energy expression and is expressed as , @xmath76 considering linear transport regime , at absolute zero temperature the linear conductance @xmath77 is obtained using two - terminal landauer conductance formula , @xmath78 with the knowledge of the effective transmission probability we compute the current - voltage ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) characteristics by the standard formalism based on quantum scattering theory . @xmath79\\,de . \\label{eqn20}\\ ] ] here , @xmath80^{-1}$ ] is the fermi function corresponding to the source and drain . at absolute zero temperature",

    "now , for the semi - infinite leads ( source and drain ) as the translational invariance is preserved in @xmath43 direction only , the wave function amplitude at any arbitrary site @xmath82 of the leads can be written as , @xmath83 , with energy @xmath84 . \\label{equ21}\\ ] ]    in eq .",

    "the self - energy matrices have non - zero elements only for the sites on the edge layer of the sample coupled to the leads and it is given by , @xmath90 where , @xmath91 is the self - energy of the each transverse channel with a specific value of @xmath86 .",

    "the @xmath41 sign comes when @xmath96 , while the @xmath40 sign appears when @xmath97 .",
    "we begin by referring the values of different parameters used for our calculations . throughout our presentation , we set @xmath98 and fix all the hopping integrals ( @xmath6 , @xmath26 and @xmath30 ) at @xmath99 .",
    "we measure the energy scale in unit of @xmath6 and choose the units where @xmath100 .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath101 is measured in unit of the elementary flux quantum @xmath102 .      to make this present communication",
    "a self contained study let us start with the energy band structure of a finite width kagome lattice nano - ribbon .",
    "we obtain it analytically .    here",
    "we follow a general approach to evaluate the band structure of a quasi one - dimensional kagome lattice nanoribbon .",
    "we establish an effective difference equation similar to the case of an @xmath1d infinite chain and this can be done by proper choice of a unit cell from the ribbon .",
    "the schematic view of a unit cell is shown by the dashed region of fig .",
    "[ kagome1 ] .",
    "we consider the ribbon to be made up of the unit cells consisting of @xmath103 atomic sites .    within the tight - binding approximation the effective difference equation for the @xmath29-th unit cell reads as , @xmath104 here",
    ", @xmath105 is a column vector with @xmath103 elements representing the wave function at the @xmath29-th unit cell .",
    "@xmath106 is a @xmath107 dimensional matrix and it represents the site - energy matrix of the unit cell .",
    "@xmath108 corresponds to the hopping integral between two neighboring unit cells with identical dimension of the site - energy matrix .",
    "since the system is translationally invariant along the @xmath43 direction , the vector @xmath105 can be written as , @xmath109 here , @xmath110 substituting the value of in eq .",
    "[ eqn22 ] we have , @xmath111 the non - trivial solutions of eq .",
    "[ eqn25 ] are obtained from the following condition .",
    "@xmath112 thus , simplifying eq .",
    "[ eqn26 ] , we get the desired energy - dispersion relation ( @xmath64 vs. @xmath85 curve ) for the finite width kagome nanoribbon .    as illustrative example , in fig .  [ dispersion ] we show the variation of energy levels as a function of wave vector @xmath85 for a finite width    kagome nanoribbon considering @xmath113 for different values of magnetic flux @xmath101 .",
    "most interestingly we see that , when @xmath114 , a highly degenerate and dispersionless flat band appears at @xmath115 ( blue line of fig .",
    "[ dispersion](a ) ) along with the dispersive energy levels .",
    "but , as long as the magnetic flux is switched on , the degeneracy of the energy levels at the typical energy @xmath115 is broken and the flatness of these levels gets reduced i.e. , they start to be dispersive . this feature is clearly observed from fig .",
    "[ dispersion](b ) .",
    "finally , when the flux @xmath101 is set at @xmath116 , the flat band again re - appears in the spectrum and it situates at the bottom of the energy spectrum i.e. , at @xmath117 ( red line of fig .  [ dispersion](c ) ) , which is exactly opposite to that of the case when @xmath114 .",
    "this feature provides the central idea for the exhibition of magnetic field induced metal - insulator transition in a kagome lattice ribbon .      the behavior of single - particle energy levels as a function of flux @xmath101 for a finite size kagome lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ energyflux ] , where the energy eigenvalues are obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian    matrix .",
    "here we choose @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "this @xmath64-@xmath101 spectrum is sometimes called as hofstader butterfly spectrum . from the spectrum",
    "it is clearly observed that a highly degenerate energy level is present at @xmath115 when @xmath101 is set at zero , and , the application of a very small non - zero flux helps to break the degeneracy which is clearly shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ energyflux ] .",
    "the presence of even a very small magnetic flux affects the phase of the electronic wave functions and thus destroys the quantum interference originated flat band .",
    "the flat band again comes back because of the quantum interference effect at the energy @xmath117 when @xmath101 is switched to @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath64-@xmath101 spectrum is periodic in @xmath101 with periodicity @xmath18 ( @xmath120 in our chosen unit system ) and it is mirror symmetric about @xmath121 . for an infinitely large system when @xmath122 , @xmath29 and @xmath82 are two arbitrary integers , @xmath123 magnetic mini - bands appear in the spectrum , and , for @xmath124 i.e. , @xmath125 , the number of mini - bands is smallest and the gap becomes widest .",
    "but in our case , we do not observe such gaps , as they are smeared out because of the decoherence of the wave functions .      as illustrative example , in fig .",
    "[ condlength ] , we show the variation of transmission probability as a function of injecting electron energy for a finite size kagome ribbon in the absence of magnetic flux @xmath101 . here",
    "we fix the width ( @xmath119 ) and vary the length @xmath126 of the ribbon . for three different lengths",
    "the results are shown in ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "sharp resonant peaks are observed in the @xmath127-@xmath64 spectrum associated with the eigenenergies of the ribbon , and therefore , it can be predicted that the transmission spectrum manifests itself the electronic structure of the ribbon . in our numerical calculations , though all the hopping parameters are set to the same value ( @xmath128 ) , but due to the difference    in the geometrical structures of the side attached leads ( square lattice ) and conductor ( kagome lattice ) , the geometry has double barrier structure which exhibits resonant tunneling conductance . the electrons tunnel from the source to drain via the discrete eigenenergy channels of the ribbon .",
    "the height and width of the transmittance peaks are associated with these level widths generated through the coupling  @xcite of the kagome ribbon to the leads and it is physically related to the time that an electron stays within the ribbon while channeling from the source to drain .",
    "as can be seen from the figures that the magnitudes of the peaks are not random , they are quantized to the integer values which corresponds to the number of transverse modes in the leads . with the increase of the length of the ribbon , the number of resonant eigenstates",
    "are also increased , and accordingly , the spectrum looks more dense , but the quantized nature and values of @xmath129 remains unchanged as the ribbon width is kept fixed at a certain value .      in order to understand the dependence of conductance @xmath77 on the ribbon width @xmath130 , in fig .",
    "[ condwidth ] , we show the variation of two - terminal conductance as a function of @xmath130 in the absence of magnetic flux when @xmath126 is fixed at @xmath131 . the conductance is directly proportional to the number of transverse modes in the leads which is defined by the factor @xmath132 .",
    "following landauer formula the conductance at @xmath133k is related to the transmission probability @xmath134 as given in eq .",
    "[ equ19 ] .",
    "it gives the total transmission probability of an electron through the ribbon by adding the net contributions of all the channels .",
    "thus we can write , @xmath135 where , @xmath136 corresponds to the transmission probability between the @xmath22 and @xmath63-th modes of the two leads . with the increase of @xmath130 ,",
    "the number of propagating transverse modes ( @xmath82 ) also increases , and therefore , the enhancement in the magnitude of conductance is achieved which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ condwidth ] .",
    "now we focus our attention on the effect of magnetic flux on electronic transport through a finite size kagome ribbon .",
    "we illustrate it by presenting transmission probabilities and current - voltage characteristics .      in fig .",
    "( [ conddos ] ) , we present the variation of transmission probability ( right column ) along with the nature of density of states ( dos ) profile ( left column ) as a function of energy for a finite size kagome ribbon considering three different values of magnetic flux @xmath101 . in the top of the left column , dos is shown when @xmath101 is set at @xmath137 .",
    "a sharp peak is observed at the right edge of the energy band due to localized states .",
    "these states are highly degenerate and are generally pinned at @xmath115 .",
    "the existence of these localized states is a characteristic feature of this kind of topology due to quantum interference effect between the electronic wave functions .",
    "correspondingly , in the transmittance spectrum ( top of the right column ) we obtain transmission peaks at the positions of extended eigenstates but _ no peak _ is observed exactly at @xmath115 referring to the localized states .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field disturbs the phases of the wave functions resulting into annihilation of the localized states and    thus a continuum of extended eigenstates is observed as shown in the middle panel of the left column where @xmath101 is set to an arbitrary value @xmath138 .",
    "accordingly , the transmission peaks are observed and notably finite transmission probability is obtained at @xmath115 , which was zero in the @xmath114 case .",
    "this feature bears the crucial importance for showing the property of insulator - to - metal transition .",
    "finally , when the magnetic flux is set equal to the half flux quantum i.e. , @xmath121 , again the quantum interference effect takes place in such a way that the sharp peak associated with the localized states re - appears in the dos spectrum ( bottom of the left column ) , but now at the left edge ( @xmath117 ) of the energy band .",
    "similarly , for this energy transmission probability vanishes and peaks in the transmittance spectrum are observed where the extended states are situated ( bottom of the right column ) .",
    "here we explore the possibility of magnetic field induced metal - insulator ( mi ) transition by investigating the current - voltage ( @xmath2-@xmath3 ) characteristics through a finite size kagome ribbon .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ curr ] , where two different values of @xmath4 are chosen .",
    "the current through the nano - structure is obtained via landauer - bttiker formalism by integrating over the transmission curve ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn21 ] ) .",
    "when the equilibrium fermi level @xmath4 is fixed at @xmath139 , almost zero current is obtained for small bias voltage in the absence of any magnetic field ( blue line in fig .",
    "[ curr](a ) ) since the localized states , placed at @xmath115 , do not contribute anything in electronic conduction .",
    "as the magnetic field is switched on , localization gets destroyed .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath4 at the particular value @xmath139 , sufficiently large current is obtained ( red line in fig .",
    "[ curr](a ) ) compared to the previous case where no magnetic field is given which yields the metallic behavior . from the careful observation",
    "we see that when @xmath5 , the best current magnification is achieved for @xmath121 .",
    "an exactly similar but reverse transition i.e. , metal - to - insulator takes place ( fig .",
    "[ curr](b ) ) when the fermi level is set at @xmath7 , instead of @xmath139 .",
    "when @xmath114 , a large current response ( metallic state ) is observed due to the presence of extended energy eigenstates around @xmath4 . on the other hand , for @xmath121 , highly degenerate localized states are formed at @xmath117 , and thus , a very low current is achieved in response to the applied bias voltage which leads to the insulating phase .",
    "to summarize , in the present paper we investigate electron transport properties through a finite size kagome lattice nanoribbon attached to two finite width leads by using green s function technique within the framework of landauer - bttiker formalism .",
    "the model quantum system is described by a simple tight - binding hamiltonian . following the analytical description of energy dispersion relation of a finite width kagome nanoribbon in presence of magnetic field , we compute numerically the transmittance - energy spectra together with the density of states and current - voltage characteristics . from the energy dispersion curve",
    "we see quite interestingly that , at @xmath114 , a highly degenerate and dispersionless flat band appears at @xmath115 .",
    "but as long as the magnetic field is switched on the degeneracy at this typical energy is broken and the flatness of these levels gets reduced i.e. , they start to be dispersive .",
    "finally , when the flux @xmath101 is set at @xmath116 , the flat band again re - appears and lies at the bottom of the spectrum i.e. , at @xmath117 .",
    "this phenomenon provides the central idea for the exhibition of magnetic field induced metal - insulator transition in a kagome lattice nanoribbon and it is justified by studying the current - voltage characteristics for two different choices of the equilibrium fermi energy @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis can be utilized in designing nano - scale switching devices .",
    "the results presented in this communication are worked out for absolute zero temperature .",
    "however , they should remain valid even in a certain range of finite temperatures ( @xmath140k ) .",
    "this is because the broadening of the energy levels of the kagome ribbon due to the ribbon - to - lead coupling is , in general , much larger than that of the thermal broadening  @xcite ."
