    "the study of complex systems pervades through almost all the sciences , from cell biology to ecology , from computer science to meteorology , to name just a few .",
    "a paradigm of a complex system is a network , described usually as a graph , where complexity may come from different sources : topological structure , network evolution , connection and node diversity , and/or dynamical evolution .",
    "perhaps the most widely known graph property is the _ node degree distribution _",
    "@xmath0 , which specifies the probability of nodes having degree @xmath1 in a graph .",
    "the unexpected findings that degree distributions of some real - world network topologies closely follow power laws stimulated further interest in network research @xcite .",
    "however , node degree distribution does not describe the interconnectivity of nodes with given degrees , that is , it does not provide any information on the total number @xmath2 of links between nodes of degree @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "_ joint degree distribution _ is defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is 2 if @xmath7 and 1 otherwise , and @xmath8 is the number of links in the graph .",
    "clearly joint degree distribution contains more information about connectivity in a graph than degree distribution : it provides information about 1-hop neighborhoods around a node .",
    "given @xmath9 , we can calculate @xmath10 , but not vice versa , where @xmath11 .",
    "although looking into the high order distributions is a complex task , reminding us there is a price to pay , a well chosen set of metrics can give us a simple partial view of high - order distributions .",
    "several such graph metrics that exploit joint degree distribution are :    * _ assortativity coefficient _ : @xmath12\\ ] ] * _ average neighbor connectivity _ : @xmath13 * _ local clustering _ : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number of links between the neighbors of @xmath1-degree nodes * _ rich - club coefficient _ : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of edges among the @xmath18 nodes having degree higher than a given value @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we define two new metrics for directed graphs : rich - club coefficient and page - club coefficient .",
    "these metrics can give us a deeper level of understanding the complex networks as they represent different projections of the joint degree distribution .",
    "when network is undirected both metrics reduce to rich - club coefficient for undirected graphs .",
    "the rich - club phenomenon refers to the tendency of nodes with high centrality to form tightly interconnected communities .",
    "since this phenomenon is one of the crucial properties accounting for the formation of dominant communities in real networks and since many real networks are directed , in this paper we suggest a generalization of this phenomenon to directed networks .",
    "the two metrics , rich - club and page - club coefficients , may not be correlated : we construct an example of synthetic ( directed ) network showing the page - club ordering and the lack of rich - club ordering .",
    "this is the outline of the paper .",
    "section [ sec - pre ] overviews rich - club coefficient for undirected networks . in section",
    "[ sec - new ] two new metrics , rich - club and page - club coefficients , for directed graphs are introduced . in section [ sec - real ]",
    "these new metrics are computed for 4 networks : ( a ) journal papers citation network , ( b ) web graph ( released from google ) , ( c ) uc patents citation network , and ( d ) e - mail communication network .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section [ sec - con ] .",
    "graphs considered in this section are undirected and unweighted simple graphs .",
    "the rich - club coefficient , introduced by zhou and mondragon in the context of the internet @xcite , refers to the tendency of high degree nodes , the hubs of the network , to be very well connected to each other . denoting by @xmath17 the number of edges among the @xmath18 nodes having degree higher than a given value @xmath1 , the rich - club coefficient is expressed as : @xmath19 after some basic analytical analysis of the rich - club coefficient @xcite",
    ", we can see that it can be expressed as a function of the joint degree distribution @xmath20 giving us a partial view of the high - order degree distribution which is far more economical to compute .    in @xcite , the rich - club coefficient @xmath21 is defined in terms of nodes with rank less than @xmath22 where nodes are sorted by decreasing degree values and the node rank @xmath23 denotes the position of a node on this ordered list normalized by the total number of nodes .",
    "several networks are compared and a threshold value of 1% , i.e. the value of @xmath24 was used to differentiate the networks and provide evidence of the rich - club phenomenon . however , a monotonic increase of @xmath25 does not necessarily imply the presence of the rich - club phenomenon . indeed , even in the case of the er graph  a completely random network ",
    "has an increasing rich - club coefficient .",
    "this implies that the increase of @xmath25 is a natural consequence of the fact that vertices with large degree have a larger probability of sharing edges than low degree vertices .",
    "this feature is therefore imposed by construction and does not represent a signature of any particular organizing principle or structure , as is clear in the er case @xcite .",
    "the simple inspection of the @xmath25 trend is therefore potentially misleading in the discrimination of the rich - club phenomenon , it can only be used as a simple statistical property to differentiate several networks in their complex structure .",
    "therefore , in order to detect rich - club phenomenon several null models were proposed that normalize the basic rich - club coefficient .",
    "a null model was presented in @xcite where the rich - club is normalized by the expression @xmath26 where @xmath27^{2}{\\sim\\atop k ,",
    "k_{max}{\\rightarrow\\infty}}\\frac{k^{2}}{\\left\\langle k\\right\\rangle n}\\ ] ] is the rich - club coefficient of the maximally random network ( uncorrelated network ) with the same degree distribution @xmath0 as the network under study .",
    "operatively , the maximally random network can be thought of as the stationary ensemble of networks visited by a process that , at any time step , randomly selects a couple of links of the original network and exchange two of their ending points ( automatically preserving the degree distribution)@xcite .",
    "an actual rich - club ordering is denoted by a ratio @xmath28 .",
    "note that in sufficiently large networks and large @xmath1 , @xmath29 becomes clearly dependent of @xmath1 .",
    "\\(a ) + ( b )",
    "in this section we consider directed graphs . a directed graph ( or digraph )",
    "is a pair @xmath30 of a set @xmath31 , whose elements are called vertices or nodes , and a set @xmath32 of ordered pairs of vertices , called arcs or directed edges .",
    "having directed networks in mind , rich - club coefficient can be defined in two ways , in terms of in - degree and out - degree .",
    "the one that we are interested in is the in - degree rich - club coefficient defined , in a very similar way to ( [ eq : rich - club ] ) , as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of directed edges among the @xmath35 nodes having in - degree higher than a given value @xmath1 .",
    "note the number 2 missing in the numerator since in directed full - mesh graph the number of edges is twice than that in the undirected graph .",
    "we can express the numerator in ( [ eq : rich - club - in - degree ] ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maximum node in - degree of the network and @xmath38 denotes the number of edges pointing from a node of in - degree @xmath39 to a node of in - degree @xmath40 . only in the case of random uncorrelated networks",
    ", @xmath38 takes the simple form @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the out - degree averaged over all nodes of in - degree @xmath39 and @xmath43 denotes the probability of a node having in - degree @xmath1 . at first sight @xmath42",
    "may seem constant in the case of large networks representing web graphs , but having in mind the power - law distribution of in - degree , the number of nodes belonging to the same in - degree class for high in - degree becomes considerably small and is insufficient for converging @xmath42 to the general @xmath44 . by inserting ( [ eq : ek->k-rich - club ] ) and ( [ eq : e > k - rich - club ] ) into ( [ eq : rich - club - in - degree ] ) we obtain the null model @xmath45 for uncorrelated directed networks as @xmath46    \\(a ) + ( b )      analogously to rich - club coefficient we define a new graph metric called page - club coefficient which refers to the tendency of high pagerank nodes , i.e. most popular pages in the web , to be highly interconnected .",
    "consider a modified random walker whose behavior is defined by the following two rules : ( a ) with probability @xmath47 , the walker follows any outgoing link of @xmath48 , chosen with equal probability , and ( b ) with probability @xmath49 it moves to a generic node of the network ( including @xmath48 ) , chosen with equal probability .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 we assume that each node has at least one outgoing link , and therefore the last equation is well defined .",
    "thus , for each @xmath48 , stationary probability @xmath51 , called also pagerank , is well defined and @xmath52 .",
    "the probability @xmath49 is referred as damping factor ; the damping factor adopted in real applications is generally small ( @xmath53 ) .    denoting by @xmath54 the number of directed edges among the @xmath55 nodes having pagerank value higher than a given value @xmath56 , the page - club coefficient is expressed as : @xmath57 please note that in the uncorrelated networks this metric converges to classical in - degree rich - club , since in uncorrelated networks the average pagerank of nodes of the same in - degree class becomes linearly dependent of the in - degree @xcite , i.e. @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the average pagerank of nodes with in - degree @xmath60 . also , it is important to mention that relative fluctuations of pagerank within the same class decrease as the in - degree increases .",
    "analogous to ( [ eq : rich - club - in - degree ] ) , an appropriate null model for page - club can be defined @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the probability of a node having pagerank @xmath56 , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are average node in - degree and average node out - degree , averaged over all nodes of pagerank class @xmath56 .      generally , all the results of the networks used in this paper show a high correlation between page - club and rich - club coefficients , see section [ sec - real ] , but one should not derive a general conclusion from this observation . in this section",
    "we generate a synthetic network showing increase of page - club coefficient and decrease of rich - club coefficient .",
    "consider the directed tree graph @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the node set , and @xmath32 , the edge set .",
    "let this tree be with depth @xmath65 , where the depth of a node @xmath48 is the length of the path from the root to the node , and the depth of the tree is the maximal length of all such paths .",
    "further , let @xmath66 be a labeled graph , where each node can have one of several labels ( depending on its depth in the tree ) , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "we denote by @xmath68 the number of depth @xmath48 nodes .",
    "assume that @xmath69 , i.e. the number of nodes increments as we move to a larger depth in the tree .",
    "we compose the edge set of the ordered pairs of vertices @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the @xmath1-th node in @xmath72 . in other words ,",
    "depth @xmath48 nodes propagate their pagerank score to depth @xmath73 nodes , and furthermore , all nodes in the same class ( depth ) have equal pagerank values . by this construction ,",
    "all the nodes , except the leaves , have in - degree 2 . to change this property ,",
    "we add additional set of nodes @xmath74 connecting to the set @xmath72 with the edge set @xmath75 , i.e. we increment the in - degree of the nodes in the set @xmath72 by @xmath76 .",
    "note that the in - degree of these additional nodes is 0 .",
    "so , we tweak the in - degree of the nodes in the class @xmath72 , @xmath77 , by the following rule : beside the leaf nodes , we start with a @xmath78 and increment the in - degree by one in every even depth , whereas for odd depths , we start with a high in - degree in lower depths and decrement the in - degree as we go in higher depths",
    ". a more formal definition would be @xmath79    such graph with depth @xmath80 is shown in fig .",
    "[ flo : synth - graph ] .",
    "what we want to achieve is the lack of rich - club ordering where nodes with high in - degree connect to nodes with low in - degree and vise versa .",
    "further , a direct consequence of the tree structure is that nodes with high page - rank will propagate their score to the successor nodes and therefore positive page - club ordering should arise . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ flo : synth ] for a generated graph of depth 50 with 1926 nodes .",
    "we observe the lack of rich - club ordering , but strong page - club ordering , as expected .",
    "also , we stress that the top 612 in - degree nodes are not sharing any links . thus , for such networks , the results of the analysis of the inter - connectivity of nodes , would clearly depend on the definition of the `` rich '' nodes ( in - degree or pagerank ) .",

    "this case happens in tree graphs , such as citation networks , where the top in - degree nodes ( roots ) have no _ out - links_.    we handle all these cases by assigning @xmath83 a value 1 .",
    "it is important to stress that @xmath83 can have a value zero , i.e. its denominator can be well defined , thus having a positive number of _ out - links _ departing the `` club '' , but no links are shared within the `` club '' .",

    "note the difference between page - club and rich - club .",
    "the page - club ordering is much more stronger than the rich - club which can be explained by having in mind the tree structure in citation network , i.e. older papers which are higher in the hierarchy have higher pagerank retrieved from all the successors independently of the number of their direct successors , i.e. , their in - degree .",
    "we also point that the top 8 pagerank nodes ( roots ) have no out - links , thus having a page - club value of one , whereas the top in - degree nodes have a positive rich - club ordering .      in the web graph released in 2002 by google as a part of google programming contest , nodes represent web pages and directed edges represent hyperlinks between them .",

    "the page - club coefficient annotates nodes with high pagerank as the `` popular '' nodes , thus , in networks where pagerank emerges as a natural metric for distinguishing between popular and unpopular nodes , one should use page - club to indicate the emergence of an `` oligarchy '' formed by `` elite '' nodes .",
