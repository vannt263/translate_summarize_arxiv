    "the axion is a nambu - goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of the peccei - quinn @xmath6 symmetry which is introduced in order to solve the strong cp problem in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the breaking scale @xmath7 of the peccei - quinn symmetry is stringently constrained by accelerator experiments , astrophysics and cosmology , and it should lie in the rage @xmath8gev in standard cosmology . in particular , the upper limit is set by requiring that the cosmic density of the axion does not exceed the critical density of the universe .",
    "in other words , the axion should represent the dark matter of the universe if @xmath7 is @xmath9gev , which makes the axion very attractive .    in the inflationary universe , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field result in adiabatic density fluctuations with a scale - invariant power spectrum which would account for the large scale structure of the present universe .",
    "this natural generation of density fluctuations is one of successes of the inflationary universe .",
    "however , if the axion exists , another kind of fluctuations is produced in the inflationary universe . during inflation",

    "the quantum fluctuations of the axion are stretched by the inflation and become classical .",
    "when the axion acquires a mass @xmath13 at the qcd scale , these axion fluctuations result in density fluctuations of the axion .",
    "however , since the axion is massless during inflation , axion fluctuations with wavelength larger than the horizon size do not contribute to the total density fluctuations .",
    "for this reason , such density fluctuations are called `` isocurvature '' . therefore ,",
    "if indeed the dark matter consists of axions , it has both adiabatic and isocurvature fluctuations and may play an important role in the structure formation of the universe .    in a previous work  @xcite the large scale structure formation due to the mixed ( adiabatic @xmath0 isocurvature ) fluctuations of the axion",
    "was studied with matter density parameter @xmath14 .",
    "it was found that the introduction of isocurvature fluctuations significantly reduces the amplitude of the power spectrum @xmath15 of the density fluctuations , keeping @xmath15 normalized by the cobe data .",
    "since it is known that the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with pure adiabatic density fluctuations and @xmath16 predicts an amplitude of @xmath15 that is too large on galaxy and cluster of galaxies scales , the mixed fluctuation model gives a better fit to the observations , although the shape @xmath15 on larger scales does not quite fit the observations .",
    "furthermore , it was also pointed out that the height of the acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation decreases when the isocurvature fluctuations are added , which can be tested in the future satellite experiments .",

    "it is well known that the shape of the power spectrum inferred from the galaxy survey  @xcite favors a low matter density universe .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider the structure formation with the mixed fluctuations in a generic flat universe ( i.e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the density parameter for the cosmological constant ) and investigate how large isocurvature fluctuations are allowed or favored in order to explain the observations .",

    "this value is for @xmath111 , but similar values are obtained for @xmath213 .",
    "if we take @xmath256 and @xmath257gev , we have from eq.([fa - alpha ] ) @xmath258gev , which is the canonical value for axionic dark matter without late - time entropy production .",
    ", the spectral index deviates from @xmath230 ( see eq.([new - index ] ) ) , and the observational constraint on @xmath1 discussed in  [ sec : obs ] becomes slightly stringent .",
    "however , the result in  [ sec : obs ] can be directly applied for smaller @xmath235 . ]",
    "it is difficult to construct a realistic model of chaotic inflation in supergravity .",
    "however , a monomial type of chaotic inflation model is very simple and is treated widely in the literature .",
    "we consider such a model in this subsection .    for simple models of chaotic inflation such as @xmath259 or @xmath260",
    "the cobe normalized value of hubble constant during inflation is about @xmath261gev . in this case , a too great amount of isocurvature fluctuations is produced , even considering late - time entropy production .",
    "however , if the potential for peccei - quinn scalar field is extremely flat , the effective value of @xmath20 during inflation can be larger and @xmath262gev is possible .",
    "@xcite when this is the case , we have an interesting amount of isocurvature fluctuations again .",
    "for example , if @xmath263gev and @xmath121 , we have @xmath264gev , which is a natural value in chaotic inflation.@xcite",
    "in this paper we have studied density fluctuations which have both adiabatic and isocurvature modes and have discussed their effects on the large scale structure of the universe and cmb anisotropies . by comparing the observations of the large scale structure , we have found that the mixed fluctuation model is consistent with observations if the ratio @xmath1 of the power spectrum of isocurvature fluctuations to that of adiabatic fluctuations is less than @xmath2 . in particular , the mixed fluctuation model with @xmath3 , total matter density @xmath4 , vacuum energy density @xmath265 , and hubble parameter @xmath5km / s / mpc gives a very good fit to both the observations of the abundance of clusters and the shape parameter .",
    "( in recent observations of high - redshift supernovae , a similarly large value for @xmath18 has been obtained .",
    "@xcite ) therefore , the mixture model of isocurvature and adiabatic fluctuations is astrophysically interesting .",
    "the cmb anisotropies induced by the isocurvature fluctuations can be distinguished from those produced by pure adiabatic fluctuations because the shapes of the angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies are quite different from each other on small angular scales .",
    "the most significant effect of the mixture of isocurvature fluctuations is that the acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum decreases . from observations of the cmb anisotropies in future satellite experiments",
    ", we may know to what degree the axionic isocurvature fluctuations are present .",
    "the requirement @xmath213 leads to constraints on the peccei - quinn scale @xmath20 and the hubble parameter during the inflation .",
    "isocurvature fluctuations with @xmath121 are produced naturally in the hybrid inflation model if we take the peccei - quinn scale @xmath19  gev .",
    "this @xmath20 exceeds the usual upper bound ( @xmath266  gev ) .",
    "however , this bound can be relaxed if there exists late - time entropy production , and in this case @xmath267  gev is allowed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath268  gev is predicted in the m - theory .",
    "@xcite thus the existence of large isocurvature fluctuations may provide crucial support for the m - theory axion hypothesis .",
    "@xcite    in the new inflation model , we also have sufficiently large isocurvature fluctuations to be observed . in this case",
    ", we do not have to invoke late - time entropy production to dilute the axion density . in a simple chaotic inflation model",
    ", we have a larger value for @xmath12 during inflation than the above two cases . in this case",
    ", @xmath20 exceeds the upper limit , even considering the late - time entropy production .",
    "however , the peccei - quinn scalar field may have an extremely flat potential , and @xmath20 may be as large as the gravitational scale . in this case , we have an appropriate amount of isocurvature fluctuations again .",
