    "the increasingly accurate observations of the cosmic microwave background  @xcite motivate the study of inflation beyond linear order in perturbation theory .",
    "since there are many models of inflation which give similar predictions for the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the tensor - to - scalar ratio  @xcite it is important to consider higher order observables . non - gaussianity has emerged as a powerful discriminant between different models of inflation .",
    "any detection of primordial non - gaussianity would rule out the simplest models of single field inflation .",
    "many ways to generate a large non - gaussianity have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "if the inflaton has a non - canonical kinetic term then the inflaton field perturbations may already be non - gaussian at hubble exit during inflation  @xcite .",
    "otherwise the perturbations are gaussian at hubble exit and any non - gaussianity must then be generated on super hubble scales @xcite .",
    "popular methods to generate a large non - gaussianity after inflation include having a feature in the inflaton potential  @xcite , the curvaton scenario  @xcite , modulated reheating / preheating  @xcite , an inhomogeneous end of inflation  @xcite or by loop domination of the bispectrum or trispectrum  @xcite .",
    "work has also been done on calculating the non - gaussianity during inflation with a separable potential @xcite and with more general potentials  @xcite .",
    "recently the authors of this paper have shown that it is possible to generate a large non - gaussianity during multiple field inflation while keeping all of the slow - roll parameters much less than unity  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study this possibility of generating a large non - gaussianity during slow - roll inflation in detail for the specific model of hybrid inflation .",
    "we consider carefully the parameter constraints and initial conditions required to do this . unlike in the previous work  @xcite we here also consider the effect of the waterfall field required to end inflation .",
    "we can therefore also compare and contrast our work to a recent paper on generating a large non - gaussianity at the end of inflation  @xcite .",
    "depending on the values of the couplings between the two inflaton fields and the waterfall field observable quantities may change when the waterfall field is destabilised .",
    "this change in the primordial curvature perturbation is possible because there are isocurvature perturbations present at the end of inflation .",
    "we also calculate further observables for this model , such as the trispectrum and the scale dependence of the bispectrum . in most cases",
    "the trispectrum is large through a large @xmath1 whenever the bispectrum is large but the relation between them also depends on the initial conditions .",
    "recently it has also been shown that for two - field hybrid inflation it is possible to generate a large loop correction to the bispectrum and trispectrum  @xcite .",
    "for a special trajectory it was shown that the bispectrum can be observably large even when the tree level value of the bispectrum is slow - roll suppressed . here",

    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in section  [ sechybrid ] we review the generation of a large bispectrum during hybrid inflation and calculate the trispectrum . in section  [ sec : waterfall ] we include the waterfall field and consider its effect at the end of inflation for different couplings between the waterfall and inflaton fields and further evolution after inflation . in section  [ sec : scale ]",

    "however if we consider the role of the waterfall field , then after the waterfall field is destabilised there may be a further evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation , which will lead to a change of the observable parameters .",
    "this applies to any model with an inhomogeneous end of inflation since there are isocurvature perturbations still present after the waterfall field is destabilised and inflation has ended .",
    "further evolution will depend on the details of reheating in a model dependent way . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this issue has not been considered in depth in any paper on an inhomogeneous end of inflation . if we assume an instantaneous transition to radiation domination ( so a completely efficient and immediate decay of the waterfall and inflaton fields ) then there will be no further change to the observables as we have argued in the previous section .",
    "however this is clearly an idealised case . for a review of reheating after inflation see for example @xcite .    in the special case",
    "where the waterfall field is also light during inflation barnaby and cline @xcite have shown there is the possibility of generating a large non - gaussianity during preheating for certain parameter values .",
    "this is possible even if there is only one inflaton field and the waterfall field present .",
    "however in this case inflation does not end abruptly when the waterfall field is destabilised so this is not the scenario we have considered in this paper .    in practice",
    "the efficiency of reheating will depend on the couplings between the waterfall and inflaton fields to any preheat fields , as well as on the ratio between @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite . in one regime where @xmath93 and @xmath94 preheating depends mainly on the inflaton fields . in the case",
    "where the two inflaton fields couple identically to all further particles preheating depends on the coupling constants @xmath95 and @xmath94 and only much more weakly on their bare masses proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "so in the case where @xmath96 which we have considered earlier it may be reasonable to expect little or no further evolution of the curvature perturbation , because the isocurvature perturbations should be irrelevant and decay during preheating . on the other hand if @xmath97 which is the case considered in some previous works on an inhomogeneous end to inflation the effect from preheating is more likely to be important . in another regime where @xmath98 and @xmath94 preheating depends mainly on the waterfall field ,",
    "so it may be that in this case the isocurvature perturbations are again unimportant .",
    "however we should also consider the period from when the waterfall field is destabilised and until preheating begins .",
    "it could be that the amount of expansion during this time also leads to an extra correction to the curvature perturbation .",
    "this is a complicated issue which deserves further investigation but is beyond the scope of this paper . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there has been no study of preheating or reheating in a model of hybrid inflation with more than one inflaton field .",
    "in general the bispectrum parameterised by @xmath0 can have both a scale and a shape dependence .",
    "we are considering the local form of @xmath0 which means that @xmath0 is shape independent .",
    "however it can still have a ( slow - roll suppressed ) scale dependence @xcite .    in our examples",
    "@xmath0 has a scale dependence both because of the exponential term in @xmath0 , ( [ fnl_our ] ) , and because @xmath32 will vary through the change of the initial value of @xmath99 .",

    "we have shown that the trispectrum is generally large through @xmath1 whenever the bispectrum is large , but that the other parameter which parameterises the trispectrum , @xmath2 is always smaller than @xmath0 and strongly suppressed compared to @xmath1 .",
    "we have also shown that for certain initial conditions it is possible that @xmath1 is the only large non - linearity parameter , so the first observational signature of non - gaussianity from this model could be the trispectrum through @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore we have shown that during slow - roll inflation the loop corrections to the power spectrum , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are always suppressed compared to the tree level terms .",
    "the suppression follows from the constraint on the background trajectory that the classical background value of the field should dominate over its quantum fluctuations .",
    "we then investigated how the large non - gaussianity which was generated during slow - roll may be changed by the effects from the end of inflation .",
    "we included the waterfall field which ends inflation when its effective mass becomes negative and it is destabilised .",
    "the effect of the waterfall field depends on the values of the coupling constants between the waterfall field and the two inflaton fields .",
    "if we choose the coupling constants so that surface where the waterfall field is destabilised corresponds to a hypersurface of uniform energy density then there is no change to the observables we calculated during slow roll .",

    "the dominant loop correction found by @xcite in each case follows by adding an internal line between the two vertices with a single internal line attached in the tree level diagrams .",
    "these diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:234loop ] .",
    "this converts two first order derivatives of @xmath7 into second order derivatives , which adds a large multiplicative factor of @xmath131 to the 1loop term .",
    "when constructing any other 1loop diagram we can either dress a vertex , which means adding two internal lines to a single vertex or connect an internal line between two external vertices where at least one of them does not have a single internal line atteched at tree level .",
    "in each of these cases it follows from ( [ n3rd ] ) and ( [ n4th ] ) that these other diagrams are not boosted by a factor larger than @xmath127 and hence are subdominant to the loops found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that all one - loop terms to the power spectrum , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are suppressed compared to the tree level terms , even for a general trajectory in field space .",
    "in fact this argument applies to any loop term , provided that we can truncate the expansion of @xmath15 at fourth order . when drawing an @xmath132loop level diagram we add an extra internal line to a diagram at @xmath133loop level .",
    "this means attaching in total two extra derivatives to the derivatives of @xmath7 corresponding to the vertices where the extra internal line is added .",
    "at most this can add a numerical factor of @xmath131 .",
    "however there is also a suppression factor of order @xmath102 which comes from going to a higher order in loops , which as we have seen explicitly in the case of the one loops diagrams always leads to a suppression .",
