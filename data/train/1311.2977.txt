    "the concatenation of these observations provides a more uniform coverage of the disk emission than a single longer integration and allows us to use a finer pixel scale in the output maps .",
    "the total mapped area of the pacs observations is 3.5  @xmath6 6.5 , but the area with high coverage , i.e. , the `` map center '' , corresponds to all regions that have at least 80% of the peak coverage , and high integration time is restricted to 1@xmath6 2 .",

    "the fact that the noise peaks at around 250 - 350 , i.e. the peak of the ism dust emission , and then drops at 500  is indicative that this is the primary source of noise at these wavelengths .",
    "the data were reduced using version 7 of the _ herschel _ interactive pipeline environment ( hipe * ? ? ?",

    "the standard processing steps were followed , with an additional jack - knife deglitching step implemented in the pacs data reduction , removing any artefacts with a significance greater than 5-@xmath12 in the jack - knifed image .",
    "this step was performed as an additional deglitching precaution only .",
    "the pacs time - line data were high - pass filtered to reduce the impact of 1/@xmath13 noise ( see section  [ filtering ] for details ) , and converted to a map using the hipe ` photproject ' task .",
    "maps were likewise made from the spire data using the ` naivemapper ' task .",
    "no filtering was performed on the spire data .",
    "the maps were created with pixel scales a fraction of the beam size .",
    "the sizes used are 1  for all pacs maps , 3  for 250 , 4  for 350 , and 5  for 500 .",
    "the spire bands are highly oversampled due to the dithering used during observations , which allows us to produce maps with a relatively fine pixel scale .      during processing the pacs time - ordered data",
    "were high - pass filtered to mitigate low 1/@xmath13 frequency noise .",
    "filtering was performed on each bolometer individually , passing all scales above a user - given input temporal scale .",
    "initially blind filtering was performed and a map made from these filtered data .",
    "this map was used to identify all structure with a significance greater than or equal to 3-@xmath12 , from which a filter mask is created .",
    "the original data were then filtered again , this time masking regions containing real structure , and the final map was projected .",
    "masking of map sources is required to remove ringing style filter artefacts along the telescope scanning directions .    even though sources in the map were masked during filtering , the expected extent and interest in the low - level emission from the diffuse outer disk meant that it was critical to quantify the impact of the filtering on the measured disk structure .",
    "for example , since the filtering is performed in the scan direction only , a small filter scale could truncate the disk along the scan direction , making a face - on disk appear to be inclined . even though two scanning directions were used to perform these observations their separation was only @xmath14 , making disk truncation a possibility .",
    "a large filter scale improves source fidelity , but it also passes equivalently larger angular scales to the map , resulting in an increased noise level",
    ".    we began by producing reference maps with a filter scale of 66  ( 16 frames ) , and generated additional maps using increasingly large filter scales .",
    "the integrated flux density on the source was then measured using a circular aperture with a radius of 30  in each map .",
    "the background was subtracted using an annulus centred on the source position , with inner and outer radii of 45  and 60  respectively .",
    "the measured flux density from each map was normalised to that measured in the reference map .",
    "the rate of change of normalised flux density with filter scale was initially high , and decreased as the filter scale became large relative to the size of the disk . following this analysis we chose to use maps created with a filter scale of 402  ( 100 frames ) where the rate of change was small for all bands .",
    "while this larger filter scale results in an increased noise level , the increase in source flux is similar , meaning that there is little loss in signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in addition , the improvement in source structure fidelity is significant , and necessary for accurate disk modelling .",
    "figure [ images ] shows the measured emission on the sky toward hr 8799 .",
    "hr 8799 is detected at all wavelengths .",
    "a compact background source , also detected at 24 and 70  by @xcite , is detected @xmath15  northwest of the disk emission and is resolved from hr 8799 at all pacs wavelengths .",
    "the images from 160  500  show asymmetric , large - scale emission in addition to the hr 8799 disk emission .",
    "figure [ irasimage ] shows an iras 100  map of the sky around hr 8799 .",
    "the significant large scale background emission underlying the hr 8799 position arises from a ( most likely background given the proximity of hr 8799 at 39 pc ) dust cloud .",
    "we have used our spire data to make a temperature map of the large - scale emission by fitting seds to each pixel in the spire maps ( convolved to common resolution ) , shown in figure [ spire3col ] .",
    "the position of hr 8799 shows up as a small region of warmer dust amid the @xmath16 k dust of the background cloud .    the emission from the hr 8799 disk is clearly resolved at all pacs wavelengths , but the impact of the underlying cirrus emission increasingly affects interpretation of the data at and longward of 160 .",
    "emission from the hr 8799 system was measured using aperture photometry .",
    "these apertures are necessarily large to include as much disk emission as possible , so at 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath17 m also include emission from the ne background source .",
    "we used apertures of 30 , 30 and 26  for 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath17 m , repectively .",
    "the aperture at 160 @xmath17 m was chosen to minimize the contribution from the large - scale background cloud , but is large enough to encompass the point - like background source . at this wavelength",
    "the high overall background level means that the flux density measured depends strongly on the aperture size , an issue we revisit below .",
    "flux densities for the background source were estimated during the modelling process using psf fitting and were subsequently subtracted from the aperture measurements .",
    "an additional issue arises due to the high - pass filtering , which removes emission on large spatial scales .",
    "while we have shown that more disk emission is not gained by increasing the filter scale , it is likely that emission is still missing from the aperture photometry because the pacs beam has significant emission on large spatial scales .",
    "for example , the pacs documentation shows that at 100 @xmath17 m with a filter scale of 100 , about 10% of the flux from a point source lies beyond 30 .",
    "this emission can not be detected with typical observations because the extended emission is very faint and normalised out by filtering ( i.e. the background sky level is set to zero ) . to account for this missing flux",
    ", we use the pacs aperture corrections of 0.87 , 0.88 , and 0.83 for 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath17 m ( at 30 , 30 , and 26 ) .",
    "the raw fluxes measured in each aperture are 472 , 616 , and 553 mjy , and the ne background source estimates are 4.7 , 11.8 , and 15.3 mjy for 70 , 100 and 160 , respectively .",
    "therefore , after subtracting the background sources and dividing by the aperture corrections , the fluxes are 537 and 687 mjy at 70 and 100 , as shown in table [ fluxtable ] , and 648 mjy at 160 .",
    "( we discuss the 160  entry to table [ fluxtable ] in the next paragraph . )",
    "the pacs observations are fairly deep , so the uncertainties on these measurements are dominated by calibration ( 2.64 , 2.75 , and 4.15% at 70 , 100 and 160 @xmath17 m respectively ) .",
    "we therefore adopt uncertainties of 15 and 20 mjy at 70  and 100 , respectively . given these uncertainties the flux densities of the disk",
    "are detected at a @xmath18 of 35 at both wavelengths .",

    "the flux density increases with aperture size , suggesting that the 650 mjy flux density likely includes some of the extended background .",
    "for example , a 30  aperture gives about 700 mjy , but a 40  aperture yields 760 mjy .",
    "obviously , not all `` estimates '' are equally good . given these uncertainties ,",
    "we take the model flux of 570 mjy as our `` best '' 160 @xmath17 m value ( as shown in table [ fluxtable ] ) , but assign an uncertainty of 50 mjy ( i.e. , a @xmath18 of 11 is achieved on the disk flux density ) .",
    "this value is higher than , but consistent with , the 539 mjy flux derived from _ spitzer _",

    "the fluxes were estimated by subtracting smooth models such that the background looked even , and adopting conservative uncertainties .",
    "herschel _ photometry and uncertainties are presented in table [ fluxtable ] . the disk is well detected at 250 and 350  ( @xmath18 of 10 and 5 , respectively ) , but has a flux detection of just 2.5 @xmath12 at 500 , where a significant part of the total detected flux density arises from the underlying cloud .      to measure the disk size directly from the images , we did 2d gaussian fits to the star+disk emission of hr 8799 .",
    "we do not attempt to fit the background source simultaneously with the star and disk .",
    "the fits are first done to restricted areas around the target due to the increasing cirrus emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "after the full width half maximum and position angle of the fits is established , the models are extended to larger scales .",
    "the orientation of the best - fit gaussians changes between the pacs and spire data ; it is likely that the background source ( unresolved at these wavelengths from the hr 8799 disk ) , is impacting the orientation of the fit in these data .",

    "these fits provide consistent results for the 70 and 100  data , both for the deconvolved size of the fwhm of the disk and its inclination and position angle .",

    "given that hr 8799 is already known to be somewhat unusual due to its very extended disk that may comprise small , radiation - dominated grains on eccentric orbits , is seems likely that the short @xmath38 is somehow related to the halo .",
    "our goal here is to present a simple characterisation of the _ herschel _ observations of hr 8799 , not a detailed model that includes possible grain properties .",
    "we therefore model the data at each wavelength independently to arrive at a surface brightness profile for each wavelength . for the spire data , which are strongly affected by the background level , we scale the pacs models to make the background level look smooth to derive disk+star flux densities .",
    "the parameterized model is basically the same as used previously for modelling _ herschel _ pacs observations @xcite .",
    "because we model each wavelength independently , however , the temperature profile is not needed and the model produces surface brightness images to compare with the data .",
    "the models are inspired by the @xcite model , comprising three distinct components .",
    "the first is unresolved , which we simply add to the stellar flux when generating the model images .",
    "the other two components are called the `` belt '' and `` halo '' , extending from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "each wavelength has a power - law change in surface brightness with radius for each component ( i.e. @xmath47 ) .",
    "as found by @xcite , the belt component has a reasonably constant surface brightness , while the halo component drops steeply with radius .",
    "the pacs models are created as three dimensional structures and then viewed with a specific geometry specified by the disk inclination and position angle to generate an image .",
    "these images are generated at high resolution and then convolved with the pacs beam ( calibration observations of @xmath48 boo processed in the same way as the hr 8799 data ) , resulting in an image that can be directly compared with the science data .",
    "the overall brightness of each component and the power - law indices were varied to find a sufficiently good match to the data at each wavelength .",
    "we also varied @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , though these were required to be the same at all three wavelengths so the models are not completely wavelength independent .",
    "a final component for the pacs models is the ne background source , which is simply added as a background point source whose location is the same at each wavelength , but whose brightness is allowed to vary with wavelength .    for spire",
    ", we used a model that attempted to achieve an overall global fit to all data simultaneously rather than choose one of the individual pacs models .",
    "the resolution at these wavelengths is not sufficiently good , and the background level sufficiently high , that this choice is not important , given that these models were only used to provide estimates of the disk photometry .",
    "the results of the modelling are shown in figure [ modelimages ] , which shows the pacs data , each model , and the residuals after subtracting the model .",
    "while some residual structure remains due to variations in the background level , in each case there is no evidence for significant departures from azimuthal symmetry .",
    "we return to this topic in the discussion section ( @xmath11 [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we found radii of @xmath49 au , @xmath50 au , and @xmath51 au .",
    "the best fit power - law parameters and unresolved component fluxes are given in table [ tab : model ] .",
    "we do not consider the contraints on the unresolved flux , the belt inner edge , and the belt power - law index to be very strong , particularly at 160 ; the belt inner edge lies within the pacs beam so these parameters are all degenerate ( see also fig [ fig : prof ] ) . at 160 ,",
    "we have in fact fixed the unresolved flux and the belt and halo power - law indices to `` sensible '' values , by which we mean they do not lead to unusual conclusions about the radial temperature structure in the outer disk ( see below ) .",
    "the outer disk radius is also poorly constrained and could continue to larger radii where the emission is here dominated by noise .",
    "the outer radius is considered representative to within a few hundred au , but we note the caveat that we can not be assured that all the flux has been captured in our maps , given the filtering and psf effects ( see @xmath11 [ datared ] ) .",
    "the power - law indices at 70 and 100  for the halo are moderately well constrained ( under the assumption that a power law is correct ) , with values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 at 70 and 100 respectively , with the uncertainties derived from the radial profiles fits , rather than the model images . the value of 13 mjy for the unresolved component at 70  agrees reasonably well with the predicted value of about 18 mjy if this component is a pure blackbody @xcite .",
    "the values of 6 and 2 mjy at 100 and 160  are less certain due to poorer resolution , but these are less than expected for a pure blackbody based on the 13 mjy value at 70 .",
    "however , given that all three lie along a line of @xmath54 , and that this dependence is steeper than expected for a 150 k blackbody , it seems likely that the emission spectrum of the warm component is not a pure blackbody .",
    "such a conclusion would be unsurprising given that debris disk spectra are commonly seen to be steeper than a blackbody in the far - ir . that the turn - over wavelength ( @xmath38 ) is shorter than usually seen may be indicating relatively small grains or a relatively steep size distribution .",

    "it is also clear that the data constrain the surface brightness profile fairly well out to 20 - 30  ( 800 - 1200 au ) while the emission is detected out to 2000 au , particularly at 100 and 160 .     and",
    "pa of 63.73@xmath4 .",
    "the dashed grey lines represent the half - width at half - maximum of the beam.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      while the pacs data are reasonably well resolved , they do not provide particularly wide coverage in terms of wavelength .",
    "therefore , we now consider the disk as resolved at 24  by _ spitzer _ @xcite . our starting point is a star - subtracted 24  image processed as described in that paper",
    "the extended disk emission in this image has relatively low s / n , so we only consider the radial profile , which is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : prof24 ] .",
    "+     to derive the profile of the extended disk component we follow @xcite and subtract a point source model scaled to the peak emission at the stellar position ( here a 3.5  boxcar - smoothed stinytim model ) to remove the contribution from the unresolved warm disk emission .",
    "this procedure is justified because the total belt+halo emission is at most @xmath565% of the total 24  emission , of which only a small fraction is expected to arise from the stellar position .",
    "the resulting belt+halo radial profile is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : prof24 ] .    as described by @xcite ,",
    "the disk is seen to be extended .",
    "the significance of the signal is weak near the stellar position due to only being slightly brighter than the point source model , and weak at large radii due to low s / n .",
    "however , the signal is strong from 5 - 50 , where it decays monotonically .",
    "a small difference here is that we find that the surface brightness is significantly above zero to slightly larger distances ( about 60  rather than 50 ) .",
    "the overall trend is similar , in that the surface brightness decays from about @xmath57jy arcsec@xmath58 at a few arcseconds radius to a few @xmath59jy arcsec@xmath58 at 50  radius .    to derive the underlying surface brightness distribution , we convolved a two - power - law model ( i.e. belt+halo ) with the stinytim psf to find the best fitting via @xmath60 minimisation . during this process",
    "we fixed the belt and halo radii to those found from the pacs data ( i.e. 100 , 310 , and 2000 au ) .",
    "the best fitting model is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : prof24 ] .",
    "while it is clear that the slope of the halo component is fairly well constrained , the inner component is not due to the large surface brightness uncertainty at small radii .",
    "the power - law slopes are @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the belt and the halo , respectively , with the uncertainties derived from the diagonal covariance matrix elements .",
    "the uncertainties are probably somewhat larger due to systematic uncertainties , such as the correctness of the point source model .",
    "however , as we show below , the observed profile is interesting when compared with the _ herschel _ data .",
    "though the surface brightness profiles highlight the radial structure well , the unconvolved model profiles can be taken one step further to show the disk emission spectrum as a function of radius , as shown in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "these combine the mips and pacs data described above . at each radius",
    "we have divided by a colour correction calculated using a blackbody given by the 70 - 100  flux ratio for the 70 , 100 and 160@xmath17 m fluxes , and a correction using the 24 - 70  correction for the 24  fluxes .",
    "this correction is only a few percent in the pacs bands and has a maximum of 1.3 at 300 au ( 39 k ) for mips . as noted below the temperatures used for these colour corrections",
    "are uncertain , but as they are small , different temperatures will not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "m data is shown at each radius ( solid lines ) as well as a blackbody fit to the 24 - 70@xmath17 m data ( dotted lines ) , with the two temperatures given at each radius . with only three reliable wavelength points at each radius",
    "the temperatures are degenerate , so here we just show independent fits to each pair of 24 - 70 and 70 - 100@xmath17m.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for all radii figure [ fig : spec ] shows that the disk spectrum at the pacs wavelengths of 70 , 100 and 160  is well described by a blackbody .",
    "however , this agreement is contrived at 160  due to uncertain model parameters . therefore",
    ", we have only used the @xmath63  data to derive the blackbody temperature at each wavelength .",
    "we also derive a blackbody temperature for the @xmath64  colour .",
    "while we would ideally fit two blackbodies simultaneously , with only three wavelength measurements ( ignoring 160 ) at each radius the temperatures are degenerate so we take these independent values as representative .",
    "the main point is that the derived temperatures are significantly different for @xmath64 versus @xmath63 . at the innermost distances the agreement is reasonable",
    "given the uncertainty in the mips profile , but not beyond @xmath65 au .",
    "the relatively flat power - law decay of the mips surface brightness profile means that as the disk temperature as derived from pacs drops , the observed mips surface brightness becomes increasing high compared to the expected level .",
    "this discrepancy might be questioned at the outermost radii , where small differences in the assumed background level could cause the mips profile to be lower ( e.g. , zero at 50 ) . however , at 20  ( 800 au ) the discrepancy is harder to explain away .",
    "the expected 37 k disk temperature predicts a 24  surface brightness of about @xmath57 mjy arcsec@xmath58 , but the observed level is two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the radial profiles from @xcite are slightly fainter than ours , but the discrepancy is still far larger than expected .    to achieve even a rough agreement of the 24  radial profile with the levels predicted by the pacs 70 - 100@xmath17 m temperatures requires subtracting a dc level of @xmath66 mjy arcsec@xmath58 from the mips image .",
    "the median and mean pixel levels are @xmath67 and @xmath68 mjy arcsec@xmath58 respectively , with a standard deviation of @xmath69 mjy arcsec@xmath58 .",
    "therefore , such a subtraction is unjustified because it shifts the mean value in the mips image by nearly 1@xmath12 .",
    "further , such a subtraction causes the median radial profile to become negative beyond 30  ( i.e. in a region where figure [ fig : prof24 ] shows it is still clearly decreasing with radius ) .",
    "therefore , while there is some uncertainty in the absolute level , it seems that the levels predicted from the temperatures derived from the pacs data and the levels seen by mips are in clear disagreement , most significantly at large radii ( @xmath70 au ) .",
    "the same conclusion would be reached using the radial profiles derived by @xcite , where there is still significant disk emission at 30  ( a few @xmath71 mjy arcsec@xmath58 at 1200 au ) , where the pacs - predicted level is less than @xmath57 mjy arcsec@xmath58 , as indicated in figure [ fig : spec ] . indeed , their favoured model had a halo component that was warmer than the belt component , despite the larger distance , which was attributed to the halo comprising smaller grains and seems consistent with the @xmath64  temperature profile derived here .",
    "alternatively , the pacs 70 or 100  profiles would need to be at least a factor of two in error at these distances to allow a single temperature consistent with the mips data .",
    "however , the good agreement between the data and model in figure [ fig : prof ] show that such a difference is very unlikely .",
    "visual inspection of the data reveals no apparent asymmetries in the emission from the hr 8799 disk , excepting the compact northwest feature .",
    "this is in contrast to recent findings in 350  maps from the cso @xcite .",
    "non - axisymmetric structure was observed , which was interpreted as evidence of particles trapped in a 2:1 resonance with the outer planet .",
    "we note that our resolution at 350  is poorer than that of the cso by an approximate factor of 2 .",
    "other than those ground - based data , no asymmetries have been seen in the disk .",
    "@xcite attribute the asymmetries in interferometric maps from the sma to noise features in low signal - to - noise data .",
    "our data are consistent with this picture .",
    "we note that strong asymmetries are not typically expected at far - infrared wavelengths , but rather models suggest that the strongest asymmetries will be observable in the submillimeter where the data sample the larger grains in the disk which are more likely to be localized in the planetesimal belts and trapped in resonances .    to place a limit on the brightness of a clump which would have been detected , we take the 5@xmath12 limit at 70  as an example .",
    "the rms at 70  is 0.34 mjy beam@xmath72 , and to see a believable substructure in the disk would have required a peak flux of 1.7 mjy . in contrast , the symmetrically distributed disk emission has a 70  flux of roughly 530 mjy .",
    "therefore , a `` discrete '' peak in the disk of flux density @xmath73% of the symmetrical emission should have been detectable .",
    "the 70  beam has a scale of 220 au at the distance of hr 8799 , so even unresolved point sources could cover a significant fraction of the inner disk .",
    "our ability to place limits on our sensitivity to still larger resolved clumps in the disk is degraded by the large filter scale applied during data reduction , a scale required to accurately recover the largest scales of the halo .",
    "the fact that no significant azimuthal structures were observed in the herschel images of the hr 8799 disk is significant because a planet formation scenario in which planets form close to the star and then migrate outward to their present positions would have favored the trapping of planetesimals into resonances @xcite .",
    "the resulting resonant structure would result in the planetesimal distribution having a clumpy structure , and observations of the level and morphology of that clumpiness would be indicative of the planets migration rate and therefore of the mechanism which caused the migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "dynamical stability studies have suggested that the hr 8799 planets could themselves be in resonance @xcite .",
    "this does not de facto imply migration has occurred in the system , since the formation of planets in situ by gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also result in resonant configurations .",
    "comparison with observations of the disk is complicated by the fact that we observe the distribution of dust , and not of planetesimals .",
    "observations at wavelengths @xmath74  are sensitive to dust that is large enough to trace the planetesimal distribution .",
    "however , shorter wavelength observations are sensitive to small dust sizes that can have an axisymmetric distribution even if the planetesimals are themselves in resonance @xcite . given the low resolution of our spire data , and the short wavelength of the higher resolution pacs images , we can not set strong constraints on the resonant structure of the planetesimal belt in this system from our _ herschel _ observations , though this is implied by the previous publication of an asymmetry in the disk at 350 @xcite .",
    "if such asymmetric structures are present , then they should be most readily detectable by alma .      from our disk model",
    "based on well - resolved images , the inclination of the disk is @xmath75 . given the azimuthal symmetry we observe , it is unlikely that the disk is inclined at significantly @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , the @xcite _ spitzer _ data also ruled out inclinations larger than @xmath77 .",
    "inclinations higher than 45  are not supported by the disk images , assuming a circular disk geometry inherent in the disk system .",
    "estimates of the stellar inclination from astroseismology suggest @xmath78  @xcite , although a value as low as 35  is not ruled out by their work ( see their figure 3 ) , but these values are inconsistent with the modeling of @xcite which suggest a near face - on inclination of 13 - 30@xmath4 .",
    "this is consistent with the orbit modeling for the detected planets @xcite , and with estimates from the debris disk modeling presented in @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that the entire hr 8799 system may be coplanar is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite , which includes hr 8799 , who found common inclinations between a significant number of stars for which the stellar and disk inclinations had been independently measured .",
    "in addition , the recent work by @xcite on the astrometry of the hr 8799 system reports an inclination of @xmath79  for the planetary orbits and measures the longitude of the ascending node to be @xmath80 .",
    "the disk position angle ( @xmath81 ) is measuring the disk longitude of ascending node , so if the planets are coplanar with the disk , we should expect both values to agree within uncertainties , which they clearly do .",
    "it is therefore likely that the entire hr 8799 star - disk - planet system is coplanar .",
    "any eccentricity in the disk is degenerate with the inclination ; therefore , the best constraint on non - axisymmetry comes from the fact that one side is not seen to be brighter than the other .",
    "conservatively , the pacs 70 observations are sensitive to a @xmath821% brightness asymmetry , which corresponds to roughly a 2% difference in dust radial distances from one side of the disk to the other ( assuming a linear dependence of flux density on temperature ) . such an asymmetry would arise if planetary eccentricities caused the disk to become offset from the star due to secular perturbations ( i.e as seen for the debris ring around fomalhaut , kalas et al . 2005 ) .",
    "fomalhaut shows a clear asymmetry from pacs images of similar s / n with an eccentricity of 0.1 ( acke et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the inner edge of the cold belt of hr 8799 s disk is at a similar radial distance as that of fomalhaut ; therefore , the disk eccentricity expected for hr 8799 must be comparable to , or below , that level .",
    "the relatively short value of @xmath83 m for the outer component ( belt+halo ) from the sed (  [ sed ] ) suggests that the emission from this component is dominated by grains smaller than this wavelength ( or equivalently has a relatively steep size distribution overall ) .",
    "it seems likely that this dominance is related to the presence of the outer halo , though interestingly the disks around fomalhaut , vega and @xmath8 pictoris , the best studied systems with haloes , have @xmath38 from 150 - 250@xmath17 m .",
    "clearly then , the existence of a detectable halo does not require a short @xmath38 .",
    "the question may therefore be one of their relative brightness ; a brighter halo weights the overall size distribution to small sizes .",
    "one way to increase the halo brightness is with a recently increased level of dust due to collisions , this increase both injects more particles into the bound ( high eccentricity ) part of the halo , as well as the unbound ( para / hyper - bolic ) part .",
    "little work has been done to compare halo models with those observed , most notably @xcite found that the halo around vega could be explained with a steady - state halo model , in contrast to the original suggestion that it was due to a recent event @xcite .",
    "the much shorter value of @xmath38 seen for hr 8799 suggests that a similar analysis should be done , with a particular focus on the possible origins of an overabundance of small ( @xmath8450 @xmath17 m ) grains compared to the vega disk .",
    "similarly , the existence of 24 @xmath17 m emission at larger radii than expected ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof24 ] ) may be related to the presence of small grains . however , in this case the reason is unclear . a possible cause is that grains in the halo have more than one composition , thus resulting in more than one temperature at a single radial distance ( although the narrow sed would seem to rule this out ) .",
    "another potential reason is that hr 8799 is passing through an overdense part of the ism , and that at least some of the observed sed actually comes from heated ism dust rather than circumstellar dust .",
    "there is however no evidence in the images that hr 8799 is strongly perturbing the ism around it , as has been observed for the nearby star @xmath85 velorum @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the blackbody fit implies a disc radius of 140 au , which lies within the true radial distribution of the dust .",
    "this is surprising as the luminosity of hr 8799 ( @xmath86 ) results in a low blowout grain size meaning that we would expect there to be plenty of small grains in the belt itself , and these would be much hotter than blackbody @xcite .",
    "such an inconsistency is not unheard of ; for instance , @xcite found that , for hd 207129 , the dominant grain size was ten times higher than the blowout limit .",
    "the lack of small grains in the belt does also place extra emphasis on the dust in the halo being the dominant component to the sed .    as discussed in @xmath11 [ asymmetric ] ,",
    "based on the modeled symmetric disk , an unresolved clump of flux density @xmath87% of the total flux at 70  would have been detectable .",
    "the smoothness could indicate that the halo is populated with bound high eccentricity small grains , as has been suggested for vega based on _ herschel _ observations @xcite , since such grains would have an axisymmetric distribution regardless of the resonant structure of the planetesimal belt @xcite .",
    "however , a population of unbound grains could also be axisymmetric , and moreover the evidence for clumping in the parent planetesimal population is limited .",
    "we have imaged the hr 8799 debris disk with pacs and spire on _ herschel _ and modeled resolved imaging at 70 , 100 and 160 . based on the sed , we find evidence of two components , a warm unresolved component of @xmath40 k and a cold , resolved component of @xmath41 k. imaging modeling reveals two distinct components of cold dust , as first identified by @xcite .",
    "we find evidence of a cold planetesimal belt , a `` kuiper belt analogue '' , extending from 100 - 310 au , and a more extended halo component from 310 - 2000 au .",
    "the radial profiles of the dust emission show a clear break at 310 au in the power - law slopes , from shallower slopes of @xmath88 to @xmath89 for the planetesimal belt to steep slopes of @xmath90 to @xmath91 for the halo ( depending on wavelength ) .",
    "the radius inferred from the blackbody fit to the cold component of the sed is 140 au , well within the planetesimal belt of hr 8799 s disk .",
    "therefore , unlike many other disks in which the grains are found at considerably larger radii than their blackbody fits would predict @xcite , in hr 8799 the grains appear to be very well fit as blackbodies .",
    "the fluxes from the planetesimal belt and halo are comparable .",
    "the sed indicates a steepening of the spectrum at @xmath92 , with an upper limit of 90 .",
    "taken as a representative of the grain size that dominates the emission spectrum , it therefore appears that hr 8799 is populated by smaller grains than other a star disks with haloes ( e.g. , vega , @xmath8 pic and fomalhaut ) , as well as a star disks in general @xcite .    the combined radial profiles of our _ herschel _ data and _ spitzer _ 24  data @xcite show that the derived temperatures are significantly different for @xmath93  versus @xmath94  beyond 500 au ( i.e. , in the halo ) .",
    "therefore , while the pacs data imply that the halo is colder than the planetesimal disk ( temperature decreasing with radial distance ) , the @xmath93  data suggest that the halo is warmer , consistent with the conclusions of @xcite",
    ". this could mean there are potentially two distinct populations of dust grains ( sizes or compositions ) in the halo and reinforces the importance of obtaining resolved imaging at multiple wavelengths to properly understand the interior physical structure of disks .",
    "we constrain the inclination of the disk to be @xmath95  and the position angle to be @xmath96 .",
    "these values are determined through image modeling and also through 2d gaussian fits to the disk emission at all three pacs wavelengths .",
    "this value of the inclination is consistent with constraints from planetary modeling in the system as well as with the inclination of the star itself , suggesting that the system has strong alignment between all three components : star , planets and disk .",
    "the agreement between the disk position angle and the longitude of ascending nodes of the planets establishes that the system is coplanar .",
    "there is no evidence of asymmetric structure in the hr 8799 disk .",
    "the symmetric models fit the disk so well that we estimate that , if substructure is present , individual unresolved clumps could be no brighter than 1% of the total flux in the symmetric distribution of emission . based on this limit on brightness asymmetry in the disk emission , and comparable constraint from the similarity in the disk radial separation of hr 8799 with fomalhaut",
