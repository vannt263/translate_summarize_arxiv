    "atomic laser cooling has become recently one of the most active research fields in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "several techniques @xcite have been developed to cool free atoms up to fractions of the recoil temperature ( i.e. the temperature associated with the recoil of a single photon ) .",
    "the sub - recoil laser - cooling methods are based on the crucial concept of dark states .",
    "these states can not absorb the laser light , and therefore can not be excited , but however can receive population via incoherent pumping , i.e. via spontaneous emission , and therefore these states behave as trapping states .",
    "the dark - state is a general concept , and can be obtained by several mechanisms , for example the destructive interference between the absorptions from the two ground states of a three level @xmath0-system , as in velocity selective coherent population trapping ( vscpt ) @xcite . on the other hand , laser cooling of trapped atoms to the ground state of a trap has been achieved for single trapped ions using sideband cooling @xcite in the lamb - dicke limit ( ldl ) @xcite .",
    "this limit corresponds to the case in which the size of the ground state of the trap @xmath1 is very small compared with the wavelength of the applied laser @xmath2 .",
    "more rigorously , ldl occurs when @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the so - called lamb - dicke parameter defined as @xmath5 .",
    "sideband cooling method only works properly in this limit , and also requires the levels of the trap to be well resolved , which is achieved in the so - called strong - confinement limit , i.e. when @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the trap frequency and @xmath8 is the spontaneous emission rate ( the level width ) .",
    "this last condition can be easily fulfilled by using a metastable excited state and quenching its population using a third fast - decaying level @xcite .",
    "however , the problem appears in the regime beyond the ldl , in which the recoil of the spontaneously emitted photons provides a heating mechanism , and therefore new cooling strategies must be proposed .",
    "the most effective techniques have been those originally designed to cool free atoms up to subrecoil temperatures , i.e. dark - state cooling techniques @xcite .",
    "a recent paper @xcite , proposes a new cooling scheme for trapped atoms beyond the ldl which combines the ideas of sideband and raman @xcite cooling and dark - state cooling , to confine a single trapped atom in the ground state of the trap .    in this series of papers ,",
    "we study laser cooling techniques similar to that of @xcite which allow the confining of an atomic sample into just one state of the trapping potential , either the ground state or an excited state .",
    "this first paper is devoted to the one - atom problem while the second one @xcite analyses the new physics appearing for the many - atom case .",
    "the one - atom problem is interesting as such in the context of quantum computation with ions @xcite , and also in the production of non - classical states of motion of single atoms or ions @xcite . also the one - atom problem is a good starting point to understand clearly the cooling processes in the many - atom case , which we discuss in detail in @xcite",
    "; therefore this paper is a good first step to analyse the possibilities to achieve the bose - einstein condensation @xcite with all - optical means .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the cooling scheme is described , as well as the difficulties to cool beyond the ldl . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] we study the one - dimensional case , analysing the cooling into the ground state of the trap ( basically summarizing @xcite ) in sec .  [ sec:1dg ] .",

    "[ sec:2dg ] the cooling into the ground state is analysed , whereas in sec .",
    "[ sec:2de ] , we employ the dark - state conditions of sec .",
    "[ sec:1de ] and also the interferential dark - states of sec .",
    "[ sec:2dint ] , to confine the atom in an excited two - dimensional state .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider laser cooling in a three - level @xmath9-system as that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the level @xmath10 is the ground state , @xmath11 is a metastable state , and @xmath12 is a third fast - decaying auxiliary state .",
    "a laser , or stricktly speaking two lasers excite coherently the resonant raman transition @xmath13 ( with some associated effective rabi frequency @xmath14 ) , while a repumping laser in or off - resonance with the transition @xmath15 pumps optically the atom into @xmath10 . with this three level scheme ,",
    "one obtains an effective two - level system with an effective spontaneous emission rate @xmath8 , which can be controlled by varying the intensity or the detuning of the repumping laser @xcite .",
    "the atom is assumed to be confined in an harmonic ( isotropic ) potential of frequency @xmath7 .",
    "we denote the states of the harmonic oscilator as @xmath16 , or @xmath17 when treating the two - dimensional case .",
    "we assume @xmath6 , i.e. we suppose the so - called strong - sonfinement limit , which is also called festina - lente limit , and turns to be a crucial point in the many atom case in order to avoid the reabsorption problem @xcite .",
    "we also assume @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which allows to adiabatically eliminate the excited state @xmath20 in the expressions below .    in the lamb - dicke limit ( ldl ) , i.e. when the dimensions of the trap are very small compared with the laser wavelength @xmath2 , it is possible to use standard sideband cooling techniques to pump the atom into the ground state of the harmonic trap . in this cooling mechanism",
    "the laser is assumed red - detuned , with detuning @xmath21 .",
    "then , the absorption of a laser photon induces the transition @xmath22 . in the ldl , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the recoil energy .",
    "then , in the spontaneous emission the photon recoil is not large enough to produce a jump between the states of the harmonic trap ; therefore only the transition @xmath25 is possible .",
    "hence , the global effect of a complete absorption - spontaneous emission cycle is a transition @xmath26 is a dark state .",
    "the latter statement is only true if we operate in the regime @xmath6 .    beyond the ldl , @xmath27 , and",
    "hence in the spontaneous process , the atom undergoes transitions @xmath28 where @xmath29 ranges from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "this process introduces a heating of the atomic distribution which prevents the confinement of the atom into the ground state of the trap . in this paper",
    "we study different techniques which allow us to overcome this problem , recovering the results of usual sideband cooling , and even obtaining new physical effects .",
    "the previous paper @xcite studied the problem of laser cooling of a single trapped atom beyond the ldl into the ground state of a one - dimensional trap . in this section",
    "we briefly review that paper , and discuss a cooling mechanism which avoids the heating effects of the usual sideband cooling by employing the two step process :    * in the first step the atoms are confined in the levels @xmath32 .",
    "this is achieved by using pulses with detunings @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the closest integer to @xmath35 .",
    "the absorption of a laser photon produces a transition @xmath36 , and the spontaneous emission @xmath37 , where @xmath29 ranges from @xmath30 to @xmath38 . as a result ,",
    "in average some energy is lost in each cycle .",
    "obviously , the states with @xmath39 remain dark , and therefore the atoms are finally confined in these states . due to this",
    ", we call these pulses confinement pulses .",
    "* using pulses of selected frequencies one can empty the trap levels @xmath40 without affecting the population of @xmath41 .",
    "then , in each cooling cycle there is some probability to pump into @xmath41 .",
    "there is also some probability of heating , and therefore we must repeat the confinement step , and so on .",
    "we call the pulses with selected frequency fine - cooling pulses .    as the result of the cooling process",
    ", the atom can be confined in the ground state of the trap , as in the usual sideband cooling .",
    "since the present cooling mechanism is based on sequences of different pulses , we call this cooling method dynamical cooling .      the dynamics of the system can be well described , after adiabatic elimination of the @xmath20 states , by the following rate equation :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the probability of the atom to be in the level @xmath44 of the trap .",
    "the transition rates are :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the laser wavevector and @xmath47 is the angular dipole pattern of the spontaneously emitted photons . using closure relations , assuming a laser detuning @xmath48 with @xmath49 an integer value , and neglecting the non - resonant terms , it is possible to write the rates to empty the level @xmath50 ( called hereafter empty rates ) in a very simple form in terms of the franck - condon factors :    @xmath51      monte carlo simulations of eq .",
    "( [ rateeq1d ] ) yield similar results to those of @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b the cooling dynamics for the case of @xmath52 , @xmath53 is shown , where the initial distribution was taken to be thermal with the mean @xmath54 .",
    "we use a sequence of four pulses of detunings @xmath55 and durations @xmath56 to confine the atom with almost total probability in the ground state of the trap .",
    "pulses @xmath57 and @xmath58 are confining pulses , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are fine - cooling pulses .",
    "the reason of applying two different confinement pulses slightly detuned one respect to the other , is the oscilatory character of the franck - condon factors , which produces , as observed in fig .  [ fig:2]a , that the empty rates have quasi - zero minima for each detuning . by applying two sligthly detuned lasers this problem",
    "is avoided because the states that one laser does not empty the other laser does , and vice versa .",
    "the same reasoning explains the use of two fine - cooling pulses .        in the present section we present a new mechanism that allows the confining of the atom into an excited state of the trap .",
    "this cooling mechanism is based on the properties of the franck - condon factors appearing in eq .",
    "( [ erates1d ] ) , which are of the form :    @xmath61}}\\frac{(-1)^{l}\\eta^{2m+s-2l}}{l!(m+s)!(m+s - l)!}. \\label{fkfactors}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for a particular excited state @xmath50 of the trap , one can prove that for certain values of the detuning and of the lamb - dicke parameter , the sum in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ fkfactors ] ) cancels out . if this occurs , and following eq .",
    "( [ erates1d ] ) , one can observe that this level @xmath50 is not emptied , and therefore becomes a dark state .",
    "the dark - state conditions for the states @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the trap , are respectively :    @xmath64    certainly , these conditions have some limitations .",
    "first of all , as the detuning must be integer ( i.e. @xmath49 must be an integer number ) , only particular values of @xmath4 are valid in order to satisfy the dark - state conditions .",
    "this is not a major problem because the trap frequency can be externally controlled .",
    "however , one must note that for the case of one - atom problem these conditions are certainly rather restrictive .",
    "dynamical cooling of a single atom is critically sensitive to the deviations from the dark - state conditions .",
    "we show in @xcite that fortunately this is not the case in the many atom problem with bosonic atoms .",
    "the limitations are overcome due to quantum statistical effects ( bosonic enhancement effect ) .",
    "using the dark - state condition it is possible to design a cooling mechanism that allows the confinement of the atom into an excited state of the trap .",
    "the cooling mechanism consists as in the ground - state cooling in a sequence of several pulses :    * \\1 .",
    "confinement pulse : exactly the same as in the ground - state cooling .",
    "the use of two sligthly detuned confinement pulses is also recommended .",

    ".  [ fig:3]a the empty rates corresponding to pulses @xmath59 and @xmath60 are depicted .",
    "note that the both pulses do not empty the level @xmath62 , and that it is the only level not emptied by them .",
    "thus , the level @xmath62 becomes a trapping state .",
    "fig.[fig:3]b shows the dynamics of confinement in the state @xmath62 for the considered sequence of pulses , where the initial distribution was taken to be thermal with the mean @xmath67 .",

    "in this section we consider the single atom cooling in two dimensions .",
    "the two dimensional problem contains essentially all of the main new physical features that appear when one considers dimensions higher than one , namely :    * the number of levels involved is larger ( squared for the two - dimensional case ) .",
    "therefore the atom can perform a random walk in a larger phase space , which means that the cooling is neccesarly slowlier than in the one - dimensional case . *",
    "cooling in one direction means heating in the other directions .",
    "this fact makes neccesary the use of lasers in different directions .",
    "therefore , we will consider two lasers propagating in directions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , providing an electric field + @xmath74 + where the parameter @xmath75 accounts for a possible difference of intensities or dephasing between both lasers . as we indicate below this parameter",
    "turns to be important under certain conditions .",
    "* confinement pulses are no longer pulses of detuning @xmath76 .",
    "this fact can be easily understood if we consider the case in which the atom absorbs a photon in direction @xmath72 . assuming a detuning @xmath77 , after an absorption the atom makes a transition @xmath78 , and after the spontaneous emission @xmath79 and @xmath80 range from @xmath30 to @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the two - dimensional quantum number @xmath81 changes into @xmath82 where @xmath29 ranges between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and therefore an average heating is produced .",

    "<S> we study the laser cooling of one atom in an harmonic trap beyond the lamb - dicke regime . by using sequences of laser pulses of different detunings </S>",
    "<S> we show that the atom can be confined into just one state of the trap , either the ground state or an excited state of the harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the last can be achieved because under certain conditions an excited state becomes a dark state . </S>",
    "<S> we study the problem in one and two dimensions . for the latter case a new cooling mechanism is possible , based on the destructive interference between the effects of laser fields in different directions , which allows the creation of variety of dark states . for both , </S>",
    "<S> one and two dimensional cases , monte carlo simulations of the cooling dynamics are presented . </S>"
