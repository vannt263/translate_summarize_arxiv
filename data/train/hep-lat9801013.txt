    "the identification of @xmath0 as the lightest scalar glueball is supported at present by two different sets of calculations . a valence approximation calculation on gf11  @xcite of the couplings for the lightest scalar glueball to all possible pseudoscalar pairs , using a @xmath1 lattice at @xmath2 ,",
    "gives @xmath3 mev for the total two - body width .",
    "based on this number , any reasonable guesses for the effect of finite lattice spacing , finite lattice volume , and the remaining width to multibody states yield a total width small enough for the lightest scalar glueball to be seen easily in experiment . for the valence approximation to the infinite volume continuum limit of the lightest scalar glueball mass , a reanalysis  @xcite of a calculation on gf11  @xcite ,",

    "the two results combined give 1693(60 ) mev .    among established resonances with the quantum numbers to be",
    "a scalar glueball , aside from @xmath4 all are clearly inconsistent with the mass calculations expect @xmath5",
    "@xcite interpret @xmath5 as dominantly composed of @xmath6 scalar quarkonium . a problem with this interpretation , however , is that @xmath5 does not seem to decay mainly into states containing an @xmath7 and an @xmath8 quark  @xcite . in part for this reason , ref .",
    "@xcite interprets @xmath5 as the lightest scalar glueball and @xmath0 as @xmath6 scalar quarkonium .",
    "a second problem is that the hamiltonian of full qcd couples quarkonium and glueballs so that @xmath4 and @xmath5 could both be linear combinations of quarkonium and a glueball , perhaps even half glueball and half quarkonium each .    for several different values of lattice spacing , lattice volume and quark mass , we have now calculated the valence approximation to the mass of the lightest scalar @xmath9 state and the mixing energy between these states and the lightest scalar glueball .",
    "the infinite volume continuum limit of the mass of the scalar @xmath6 state we find lies at least 200 mev below the mass of the lightest scalar glueball , ruling out the interpretation of @xmath0 as an @xmath6 state with @xmath5 as a glueball . for the mixing energy evalulated at the strange quark mass , @xmath10 , and at the average light quark mass , @xmath11",
    ", we find the infinite volume continuum limit of @xmath12 to be 1.31(12 ) . if this ratio is placed in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath5 is at least 75% @xmath6 quarkonium and that @xmath0 is at least 75% glueball .",
    "in addition , we find that @xmath5 acquires a significant component of @xmath13 from mixing with @xmath14 , composed mainly of @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath15 components of @xmath5 , however , have opposite sign , interfere destructively in decay to @xmath16 final states and suppress the partial width of @xmath5 by a factor of @xmath17 or less in comparison to an unmixed @xmath6 state .",
    "this suppression provides an explanation for the small observed @xmath16 partial width .",
    "our calculations were done on ensembles of 2288 configurations on @xmath18 at @xmath19 of 5.93 , 1781 configurations on @xmath20 at @xmath19 of 5.93 , 582 configurations on @xmath21 at @xmath19 of 6.17 , and 1003 configurations on @xmath22 at @xmath19 of 6.40 . to vacilitate extrapolation to zero lattice spacing , the smaller lattice with @xmath19 of 5.93 , and the lattices with @xmath19 of 6.17 and 6.40",
    "were chosen to be nearly the same size in units of the rho compton wavelength , with periods @xmath23 of 6.1(1 ) , 6.6(2 ) and 6.3(2 ) , respectively  @xcite , in the two equal space directions .            following ref  @xcite we evaluated on each ensemble correlation functions with random sources built from quark and antiquark fields . averaging over random sources yields the correlation functions @xmath24 for @xmath25 either @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are , respectively , the smeared scalar and pseudoscalar operators of ref .",
    "@xcite built from a quark and an antiquark field and @xmath31 is the smeared scalar glueball operator of ref .",
    "we omit , for lack of space , a discussion of our choices of smearing parameters .    from the large @xmath32 asymptotic behavior of the diagonal correlators , @xmath33 we found the masses @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and field strength renormalization constants @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . from the asymptotic behavior of the off - diagonal correlator for @xmath34 close to @xmath36 @xmath40 we then found the glueball scalar - quarkonium mixing energy e. eqs",
    ".  ( [ diagzm ] ) and ( [ offdiag ] ) have been simplified by omitting terms arising from propagation around the lattice s periodic time boundary .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the scalar quarkonium mass as a function of quark mass for the two lattices with @xmath19 of 5.93 . for both lattices the solid lines are fits to quadratic functions of quark mass which we used to interpolate to the strange quark mass .",
    "the strange quark mass we chose as the value which yields , in physical units , a pseudoscalar mass squared of @xmath41 , for @xmath42 and @xmath35 the observed kaon and pion masses , respectively . as shown by the figure , for the lattice @xmath43 with @xmath23 of @xmath44 the scalar mass as a function of quark mass flattens out as quark mass is lowered toward the strange quark mass and then actually begins to rise as the quark mass is decreased still further .",
    "this feature is absent from the data for @xmath20 with @xmath23 of @xmath45 at @xmath19 of 5.93 and is thus a finite - volume artifact .",
    "it is present also in the data , not shown , at @xmath19 of 6.17 with @xmath23 of 6.6(2 ) and at @xmath19 of 6.40 with @xmath23 of 6.3(2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : masscont ] shows a linear extrapolation to zero lattice spacing of the @xmath6 scalar mass , measured in units of the rho mass , for @xmath23 near 6 , along with the point at @xmath19 of 5.93 with @xmath23 near 9 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath23 of 6 , the continuum limit of the @xmath6 scalar mass lies more than 200 mev below the valence approximation to the scalar glueball mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : masscont ] shows also that as @xmath23 is increased from 6 to 9 , the @xmath6 scalar mass falls . thus the infinite volume continuum limit of the @xmath6 scalar mass should be more than 200 mev below the scalar glueball mass .            figure  [ fig : mix ] is the analogue of figure  [ fig : mass ] for quarkonium - glueball mixing energy . for mixing energy",
    "the quark mass dependence shows no anomoly .",
    "the mixing energies at difference quark masses turn out to be highly correlated and depend quite linearly on quark mass . for @xmath19 of 6.17 and 6.40",
    "the mixing energy behaves similarly .",
    "it appears that the mixing energy can be extrapolated reliably down to the average light quark mass @xmath46 . for the data at @xmath19 of 5.93 , the mixing energy ratio @xmath47 is 1.17(3 ) for @xmath23 of 6.1(1 ) and 1.14(5 ) for @xmath23 of 9.2(2 ) .",
    "the ratio has at most rather small volume dependence and thus seems already to be near its infinite volume limit with @xmath23 of 6.1(1 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mixcont ] shows a linear extrapolation to zero lattice spacing of quarkonium - glueball mixing energy at the strange quark mass giving a limit of of 56(37 ) mev .",
    "a linear extrapolation of the ratio @xmath12 gives a continuum limit of 1.31(12 ) .",
    "if our predicted value of the ratio of mixing energies is used in the mixing model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the mixing results described earlier . with this choice of mixing energy ratio ,",
    "an additional predicition of the model is that the state @xmath48 , composed mainly of @xmath15 , picks up most of the glueball amplitude that leaks out of @xmath0 and therefore should be significantly more prominent in @xmath49 radiative decays than is the @xmath5 .",
    "this prediction is consistent with slac mark iii data  @xcite . for the mixing energy evaluated at the strange quark mass , @xmath10 ,",
    "the model predicts 72(6 ) mev .",
