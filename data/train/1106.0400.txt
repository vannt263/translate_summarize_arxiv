    "the study of cosmic explosions , the energetic events marking the deaths of stars , is a unique subfield of astrophysics in the sense that its research subjects are variable sources on timescales much shorter than human lifetimes .",
    "furthermore , many physical aspects of these events can only be revealed by observations conducted shortly after explosion .",
    "an extreme case are gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; e.g. , piran 2004 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ; nakar 2007 ) , where the most energetic radiation is emitted within a few seconds after the explosion .",
    "the study of grbs has seen much progress following the launch of the _ swift _ satellite , enabling rapid multiwavelength follow - up observations of grbs .",
    "investigation of optical transients has thus far lagged behind in this respect . rapidly detecting optical transients from among the multitude of constant ( and variable ) sources visible in the data stream from wide - field optical surveys",
    "has proved challenging for existing systems .",
    "initial progress in securing very early - time observations of optical transients was made with relatively smaller surveys such as the lick observatory supernova search using the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; e.g. , ganeshalingam et al .",
    "2010 ) and the texas supernova survey using the rotse telescopes ( e.g. , quimby et al . 2007 ) , or due to chance coincidences such as supernovae ( sne ) occurring in fields being monitored due to previous supernova ( sn ) explosions ( e.g. , stritzinger et al . 2002 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "one of the main science goals of the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) wide - field variability survey ( rau et al . 2009 ; law et al .",
    "2009 ) is to remedy this situation , and to facilitate real - time discovery and prompt monitoring of optical transients .",
    "following recent upgrades to the computing infrastructure and software that now process all ptf data in real time and disseminate internal alerts about transients , and finalization of the operational aspects required to make use of these discoveries , the ptf is now a real - time optical variability experiment .",
    "target - of - opportunity ( too ) programs are in place to conduct rapid multiwavelength follow - up observations of ptf transients .    here",
    ", we describe the ptf operational setup enabling real - time discovery and rapid too observations of optical transients .",
    "we describe in some detail a specific example , the discovery and multiwavelength follow - up campaign of the optical transient ptf10vdl .",
    "our observations of this remarkably subluminous type ii - p sn demonstrate the scientific potential of data collected shortly after explosion .",
    "ptf images ( currently @xmath1  megapixels per exposure , or 184 mb per full array readout ) are recorded on computers inside the 48-in schmidt telescope dome at palomar observatory , and are then rapidly transmitted to the national energy research scientific computing center ( nersc ) at lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) .",
    "a series of software components is then run in sequence ( nugent et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) , including image detrending , astrometry , image subtraction with respect to deep references produced from coadditions of previous ptf data , and object detection in the difference images .",
    "all of these data are loaded into a database upon which a series of quality cuts to reject artifacts is performed , followed by a rough classification into four groups by the oarical software .",
    "these groups include candidate sne , sources in galactic nuclei , variable point sources , and moving objects . within @xmath2 min from image acquisition ,",
    "internal alerts are circulated , informing interested collaboration members of recent discoveries and classifications .",
    "this selection process will be described in more detail in a forthcoming publication ( bloom et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "once the automated discovery pipeline runs to completion , several additional processes begin .",
    "first , follow - up observations for the most promising candidates ( candidate sne or sources near known nearby galaxies ) are robotically triggered",
    ". optical imaging is scheduled at the robotic 60-in ( 1.5 m ) telescope ( p60 ; cenko et al .",
    "2006 ) at palomar observatory , while an infrared follow - up request is sent to pairitel .",
    "next , manual scanning of recent discoveries is conducted .",
    "taking advantage of the 10hr time difference between israel and california , a duty astronomer at the weizmann institute monitors recent discoveries from palomar during israeli daytime , and can manually trigger additional follow - up observations if desired ( see below ) . at the end of each night , good candidates are sent to be screened by the citizen - science `` supernova zoo '' program ( smith et al . 2011 ) , while custom database queries are run by collaboration members with specific focused interests ( local universe transients , e.g. , kasliwal et al .",

    "there were 70 nights during which the survey was running for at least part of each night . during those nights",
    ", there were 732 automated alerts for extragactic transients ( so about 10 per night , on average ) , of which 296 were considered likely sne , 208 likely agn ( mostly from known sources ) and 228 were nuclear events of undetermined nature .",
    "weizmann duty astronomers saved 172 events as high - priority sn candidates for follow - up ; of those 97 ( @xmath3 ) were spectroscopically followed - up , leading to the discovery of 79 sne ( @xmath4 , of which 64 were of type ia ) .",
    "the events observed spectroscopically but not determined to be sne were cvs or other variable stars ( 9 ) , four galaxy spectra ( likely resulting from target sne fading away , errors in spectroscopic acquisition or spurious detections ) , four spectra which were of too low s / n to identify the nature of the target , and one asteroid . during spring / summer time",
    "the ptf discovery rates are substantially higher , due to a combination of better weather at palomar and the survey strategy , however , the realtime procedures described here were only perfected during summer 2010 , and we therefore provide statistics based on the above period .",
    "rapid follow - up programs designed to monitor ptf discoveries ( mostly in too mode ) are in place .",
    "a partial list of currently active programs includes access to the wise observatory 1-m and 18-in telescopes , which , with the benefit of the 10hr time difference with respect to palomar , can provide rapid `` same - night '' confirmation imaging ( see below ) .",
    "additional too photometry can be obtained by the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ) , while continued optical monitoring of sne is conducted using the 0.75 m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) at lick observatory , and at the liverpool telescope ( lt ) in la palma .",
    "too spectroscopic programs , as well as many classically scheduled nights , provide access to the 10 m keck telescopes , the 5 m hale telescope at palomar observatory , the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory , the 8.1 m gemini north and south telescopes , the 8.2 m very large telescope ( vlt ) units at the european southern observatory ( eso ) site on paranal , the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory , the 3.5 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ; service queue mode ) in la palma ( spain ) , and the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope on mauna kea .",

    "ultraviolet ( uv ) , x - ray , and @xmath0-ray observations are obtained with the _ swift _ mission .",
    "these resources provide a high probability that multiwavelength follow - up observations for an interesting ptf target can be obtained on short timescales ( hours ) .",
    "we exemplify this capability in the next section using observations of ptf10vdl .",
    "other recent examples include ptf10fqs ( kasliwal et al .",

    "the association of this optical transient with a nearby host galaxy ( ngc 7483 at redshift @xmath7 ; springob et al .",

    "it appears as if the underluminous events , ptf10vdl and sn 2005cs , transition sharply from a rise to a plateau , compared to the more luminous sn 2006bp .",
    "additional events ( and even better data ) are required to determine if this is a general trend .",

    "2006 ; poznanski et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "while low - luminosity events such as ptf10vdl are expected to be rare in flux - limited cosmological sn samples , it is instructive to examine whether this event follows the general relation . using the parameters from poznanski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , we find that ptf10vdl is a significant outlier , @xmath35mag away from the benchmark set by higher luminosity sne  ii - p .",
    "its velocity on the plateau ( 1800kms@xmath15 ; fig .",
    "5 ) translates into a positive luminosity correction of @xmath36mag , with an additional 0.25mag from its color correction . however , its plateau luminosity is more than 3mag fainter than that of the average sn  ii - p .",
    "we note that sn 2005cs ( which is somewhat brighter than ptf10vdl , but still considered among the low - luminosity sn  ii - p group ; pastorello et al .",
    "2009 ) does follow the cosmological relation .",
    "even if some fainter sne  ii - p like ptf10vdl violate the correlations established at higher luminosities , this is unlikely to impede future efforts to use sne  ii - p as cosmological beacons , as such faint objects are rare in flux - limited samples . on the other hand ,",
    "this apparent anomaly motivates further studies of low - luminosity sne  ii - p and continued investigation of the physics driving observed correlations ( e.g. , kasen & woosley 2009 ) . the combination of early spectroscopic observations and uv / optical light curves makes ptf10vdl an attractive target for such studies , as well as for comparison with detailed explosion models ( e.g. , baron et al .",
    "2004 ; dessart et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "our _ swift _ observations resulted in solid detections of ptf10vdl in all uv filters ( kasliwal et al .",
    "2010a ) , and a nondetection in x - rays .",
    "carma and evla observations also resulted in upper limits ( carpenter et al .",
    "2010 ; kasliwal et al .",
    "it is interesting to note that both _",
    "swift _ and evla observations were delayed by @xmath37hr due to technical limitations that should generally not apply ; thus , future ptf events should be observed even sooner , increasing the exciting prospect of x - ray , uv , and radio detection of prompt , nonthermal radiation from cosmic explosions detected by ptf .",
    "note that the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) discovered the same object @xmath35day after our ptf discovery ( lin et al .",
    "2010 ) , but cbet procedures prevented the dissemination of this information for several days , until it was announced as sn 2010id .",
    "it thus seems that high - cadence observations of nearby galaxies by loss should also be able to contribute to future discoveries at very early times .",
    "early detection and rapid follow - up observations , as demonstrated with ptf discoveries , are interesting for a number of reasons",
    ". the first electromagnetic manifestation of the explosions of massive stars as core - collapse sne would be the process of the outgoing shock emerging from the stellar envelope ( so - called `` shock - breakout '' ) , followed by a period of rapid radiative cooling .",
    "ptf optical data alone can now be used to detect such explosions during the first hours after they occur , and to trigger space - based follow - up observations in the uv and x - rays . at least for exploding red supergiants ,",
    "the few - hour timescale should allow observations of the tail ( at least ) of the shock - breakout process as well as the subsequent cooling , enabling measurement of the radius of the exploding star and determination of its atmospheric composition ( e.g. , rabinak & waxman 2011 ) , and perhaps even constraining shock - breakout physics ( e.g. , katz , budnik , & waxman 2010 ; nakar & sari 2011 ) .",
    "such data would be extremely valuable to guide and constrain massive - star evolution models .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the observations of ptf10vdl presented here would prove useful in this respect .",
    "very early observations of thermonuclear sne  ia ( for recent ptf examples , see cooke et al .",
    "2011 ; howell et al .",
    "2010 ; kasliwal et al .",
    "2010c ) would provide constraints on the progenitors of these important cosmic distance estimators ( e.g. , kasen 2010 ) .",
    "several more exotic scenarios predict fast transients on @xmath35day timescales ( e.g. , compact - object mergers , metzger et al .",
    "2010 ; accretion - induced collapse of a white dwarf to a neutron star , metzger et al .",
    "if these transients emit enough red light to be detected by the ptf @xmath18-band survey , rapid follow - up observations would be critical for studying their properties during their fleetingly short luminous phases .",
    "an important aspect common to the processes mentioned above ( sne , compact - object mergers ) is that they are expected to be leading sources of gravitational waves in the advanced ligo / virgo bands , as well as potential sources of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "a narrow timing window based on coincidence with ptf optical detections would allow searching for signal over a significantly shorter stream of background noise , thereby reducing the minimal detection threshold and increasing the effective sensitivity of existing detectors ( e.g. , kochanek & piran 1993 ; cowen , franckowiak , & kowalski 2010 ) .",
    "while ptf will no longer be active during the next ligo science run expected to begin in 2014 , developing and polishing the real - time capability will be highly beneficial for synergy between ligo and future successors of ptf , as well as between ptf and current neutrino experiments such as ice cube .    to summarize",

    "<S> the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) is an optical wide - field variability survey carried out using a camera with a 7.8 square degree field of view mounted on the 48-in oschin schmidt telescope at palomar observatory . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key goals of this survey is to conduct high - cadence monitoring of the sky in order to detect optical transient sources shortly after they occur . here , we describe the real - time capabilities of the ptf and our related rapid multiwavelength follow - up programs , extending from the radio to the @xmath0-ray bands . </S>",
    "<S> we present as a case study observations of the optical transient ptf10vdl ( sn 2010id ) , revealed to be a very young core - collapse ( type ii - p ) supernova having a remarkably low luminosity . </S>",
