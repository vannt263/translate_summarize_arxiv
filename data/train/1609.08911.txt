    "we conclude from here that the characteristic length of the band bending is defined moistly by the helical surface states rather than bulk carriers .",
    "let us consider various contributions to the shift of the chemical level position near the steps .",
    "first of all , the observed shift of the chemical potential level towards the bulk conduction bands corresponds to the well known for ordinary metals reduction of the work function near a step edge @xcite .",
    "the effect results from redistribution of electron wave functions between outer and inner edges of surface steps .",
    "we see two quantitative differences in comparison with ordinary metals such as gold @xcite : the value of the effect is smaller ( 0.10.2  ev instead of @xmath61  ev in gold @xcite ) , but the characteristic length of the effect is bigger ( @xmath6  nm instead of @xmath62  nm in gold @xcite ) . such a smaller value of the shift and bigger length reflects participation of the helical surface states having smaller electron density , @xmath63 , near the surface ( @xmath64  @xmath65 for @xmath66  nm ) than that in usual metals ( @xmath67  @xmath65 ) .",
    "this contribution is considered as a dominating one .    a contribution to",
    "this shift may come from the difference of the dirac point position on different surfaces with respect to the bulk bands .",
    "in particular , the position of the dirac point on ( 111 ) surface is 0.15  ev lower than its position at @xmath68 surface @xcite , so a band bending is expected . in principle , a contribution to the chemical potential shift may also come from a difference of work functions , @xmath69 , of different surfaces of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 coupled electrostatically . the first - principle calculation @xcite gives the values of the work function @xmath70  ev and @xmath71  ev for the unrelaxed @xmath72 and @xmath68 surfaces respectively , and 5.81  ev and  4.97 ev for relaxed ones .",
    "the sign of the work function change corresponds to our observations .",
    "in addition , a contribution into the chemical potential shift may come from lack of helical surface states near the step edge .",
    "indeed , the topologically protected surface states in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 correspond to relatively small values of the wave vectors , @xmath73  @xmath5 .",
    "that means deficit of the electron concentration in the region @xmath74 @xcite . in some sense , this contribution is similar to one responsible for reduction of the work function value of stepped surfaces of usual metals @xcite , but develops inside a crystal . a respective flattening of @xmath2 curves in the dirac point region ( see e.g. @xmath2 curves in fig .  [ vahprofile](a ) at @xmath75  nm and fig .  [ vahprofile2](a ) at @xmath76 and 10.5  nm )",
    "may be a signature of this effect .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "[ musigma1](a ) and ( b ) shows that a noticeable ldos change at @xmath46 is observed only in the regions with relatively large change of the chemical potential level @xmath77  ev . at higher steps or 1ql step in the vicinity of 2ql step a shift of the chemical potential by @xmath78",

    "[ vahprofile2 ] where the curve at @xmath79  nm demonstrates the biggest extra density , and where all the states on the middle terrace has ldos higher than any other points on the top and bottom terraces .    in principle",
    ", there is a number of possibilities for appearance of extra ldos in the vicinity of the steps .",
    "the most obvious is related to dangling bonds on a side surface .",
    "their overlapping may form an 1d channel along a step .",
    "its fingerprints would be van hove singularities , as well as possible suppression of states on the fermi level due to coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "neither of these contributions is observed .",
    "instead , sometime we observed localized peaks ( fig .",
    "[ vahprofile ] ) which we attribute to localized dangling bonds .",
    "another possibility was considered by sen and co - authors @xcite .",
    "they found that the application of a potential barrier along an edge can give rise to states localized at the edge and have a linear energy - momentum dispersion .",
    "but the most essential question is whether the observed growth of @xmath44 really corresponds to the increase of ldos .",
    "it will be argued below that a major part ( if not all ) of the observed @xmath44 growth is actually caused by a modification of the transmittance of the vacuum tunneling barrier due to a shift of the chemical potential level .",
    "let us consider the effect of chemical potential shift , @xmath51 , on the tunneling spectra , @xmath2 , following ref .",
    "@xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is enough to analyze the simplest model in zero temperature limit .",
    "the tunneling current can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are respectively surface and tunneling tip densities of states , and @xmath83 is transmittance of the tunneling gap . in the wkb approximation",

    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the observed growth of normalized @xmath2 near the step edge of the topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is practically totally accounted for by the effect of shift of the chemical potential level .",
    "no well reproducible changes of the shape of @xmath2 curves near surface steps was found .",
    "we would suggest that _ p_-type thin films of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 grown _ in situ _ and having regular oriented surface steps could be better candidate for experimental search for the edge states .",
    "we demonstrate here that the energy structure of the surface states of the topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 revealed by sts exhibits dramatic changes near the step edge : there is shift of the chemical potential level which is accompanied by apparent growth of @xmath2 value at the dirac point .",
    "various contributions into the chemical potential shift are analyzed .",
    "the most universal one corresponds qualitatively to reduction of the work function on stepped surfaces of topologically trivial ( normal ) metals .",
    "quantitative differences ( smaller value of the chemical potential shift and bigger spatial scale ) reflect specifics of topological insulators : smaller surface current carrier concentration and smaller wave vectors of the surface helical states .",
    "we also demonstrate here that the apparent growth of @xmath2 near the step edge is actually the artifact of the sts method .",
    "this growth is almost entirely accounted for by the voltage - dependent transparency of the tunneling barrier and therefore can not be considered as an indication of increase of ldos near the step edge .",
