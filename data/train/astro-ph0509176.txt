    "the gaseous cores of galaxy clusters have defied interpretation for almost three decades .",
    "initially , gas in the cores of clusters was thought to cool , condense , and flow toward the center , as long as the time required for the central gas to radiate away its thermal energy was less than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "most galaxy clusters satisfy this condition , and those that do have traditionally been called cooling - flow clusters .",
    "early estimates of their mass accretion rates ranged as high as @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the problem with this interpretation of the data was that the mass sink for all this supposedly cooling and condensing gas has never been found @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic x - ray observations have now established that the rates of cooling and condensation in galaxy clusters are much lower than those originally inferred from the imaging observations @xcite .",
    "there is little evidence for emission lines from gas cooling much below about half the ambient temperature of the hot gas filling the cluster .",
    "the cooling process seems to have stopped in its tracks , implying that a compensating heat source resupplies the energy radiated by the gas in cluster cores .",
    "supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxy clusters are an attractive candidate for supplying that heat energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "clusters suspected of harboring cooling flows are statistically more likely to contain radio emission indicative of recent black - hole activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that radio emission often coincides with cavities in the x - ray emitting plasma , clearly showing that outflows from the nuclei of galaxies are interacting with the core gas in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "measuring the work needed to inflate these cavities reveals that each outburst of energy from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) introduces @xmath5 into the intracluster medium @xcite , which would be sufficient to stop the cooling if such outbursts occurred every @xmath0 years or so , supplying a time - averaged energy input rate @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "while agn heating is certainly plausible , it has not been clear how the outburst energy gets transfered to the intracluster gas ( cf .",
    "suggestions that the agn outflow heats the ambient gas by driving a powerful shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were dismissed when early _ chandra _ observations showed cool rims rather than hot ones around the x - ray cavities , motivating investigations into gentler heating mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the cool rims now seem to consist of low - entropy gas transported to larger radii by the buoyantly rising cavities , but there are other reasons why gentle heating mechanisms have been preferred .",
    "one is that clusters with short central cooling times have iron abundances that strongly decrease with radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an impulsive injection of energy at the center of the cluster would appear to destroy such a gradient by causing the cluster core to convect , thereby mixing the iron more uniformly ( but see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "another is that the abrupt jumps in gas pressure expected of shocks were not obvious in much of the early chandra data ; however , detecting a localized region of hot gas can be quite difficult if emission from lower - temperature gas is present along the same line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some recent x - ray observations are suggesting that the shock - heating hypothesis may have been prematurely discarded .",
    "chandra _ images of hydra a @xcite and ms0735 + 7421 @xcite have revealed that agn activity can drive shock fronts to distances @xmath7  kpc from the center , indicating that a kinetic power output @xmath8 has persisted for @xmath0 years in those clusters .",
    "cases like these may be rare , but objects that currently show radio emission indeed seem systematically different from ones that do not .",
    "@xcite have reported that groups of galaxies with radio emission have systematically lower x - ray luminosities and higher x - ray temperatures than those without radio emission .",
    "they interpret this difference as transient spikes in temperature because the ratio of optical to x - ray luminosity shows no such systematic difference .",
    "another clue comes from _ chandra _ observations of two radio - quiet clusters by @xcite .",
    "both clusters were classified as strong cooling flows by @xcite , but their central cooling times ( @xmath9 years ) are much longer than the central cooling times of cooling - flow clusters with current radio activity ( @xmath0 years ) . either the gas in these clusters has never cooled and condensed , obviating the need for feedback , or they experienced such a dramatic feedback episode sometime in the past that they have not required any additional feedback for @xmath9 years . the fact that signs of agn feedback appear only in those cooling - flow clusters that currently require feedback strengthens the case for agn heating as the mechanism that limits cooling .    here",
    "we revisit shock heating in the context of a _",
    "sample of classic cooling - flow clusters @xcite .",
    "profiles of gas entropy in the cores of these clusters show a striking consistency that stands as a strong constraint on any model purporting to explain the cooling - flow problem .",
    "section 2 assesses the clues these profiles hold about the cooling and feedback mechanisms in cluster cores , while section 3 outlines a framework for agn heat input consistent with those clues .",
    "the picture we arrive at from analyzing these entropy profiles agrees in many respects with the agn - heating models inspired by the x - ray cavities and is aligned with the suggestion of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) that episodic outflows from agns quench cooling and condensation in clusters , limit the maximum luminosity of galaxies , and regulate the growth of black holes at their centers .",
    "we show that outbursts of @xmath1 occurring on a @xmath0  year timescale are sufficient to maintain the observed core entropy profiles . however , unusually powerful outbursts like those seen in hydra  a and ms0435 + 7241 , which are rarer and longer - lasting than those needed to maintain the observed profiles , may also play a role in extending the time between outbursts and in elevating intracluster entropy beyond the cores of clusters .",
    "section 4 summarizes our results .",
    "we focus here on the entropy content of intracluster gas rather than on temperature and gas density individually because entropy offers more direct insights into the processes that add and remove thermal energy from the gas . adding heat energy to a cluster does not simply raise the gas temperature .",
    "instead , the heat input causes the cluster s gas to expand within its potential well , and the temperature it achieves after relaxing to equilibrium depends primarily on its entropy distribution and the shape of that potential well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we will quantify entropy with the adiabatic constant @xmath10 , because this quantity provides the most direct link between x - ray observations and entropy content .",
    "figure [ profs+mod+10 ] shows nine core entropy profiles of cooling - flow clusters taken by @xcite from the _ chandra _ archive : 2a0335 + 096 , abell  133 , abell  262 , abell  496 , abell  1795 , abell  2029 , abell  2052 , hydra a , and pks 0745 + 191 .",
    "the data were azimuthally averaged in annuli centered on the cluster core and then deprojected , giving @xmath11 and @xmath12 as functions of radius , which were then combined into @xmath13 profiles .",
    "the similarity among the profiles immediately suggests that some sort of quasi - steady process stabilizes the intracluster gas .",
    "there are no large entropy inversions outside of 10  kpc , and the apparent entropy inversion seen at @xmath14  kpc in one of the clusters ( abell  2052 ) arises primarily from non - axisymmetric structure owing to its x - ray cavities .",
    "also notable is the fact that entropy at a given physical radius is quite similar from cluster to cluster , even though the clusters range in temperature from 2.2 kev to 7.4 kev . that form of similarity can be understood if the entropy profiles of clusters scale with the characteristic halo temperature @xmath15 according to @xmath16 , as suggested by the data of @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the dependence of entropy on radius in these clusters is @xmath17 with @xmath18 . assuming that @xmath19 and that the virial radius of a cluster s halo is @xmath20 , one finds that @xmath21 .",
    "in other words , the @xmath13 profiles depend only weakly on temperature , as long as the entropy at a given fraction of the virial radius is @xmath22 .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this altered entropy scaling stems mostly from cooling and supernova feedback during the epoch of galaxy formation or whether it requires additional agn heating at lower redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    the thick solid line in figure [ profs+mod+10 ] shows the core entropy profile one would expect for a 5 kev cluster in which radiative cooling operates without any feedback , according to @xcite .",
    "their model started with the baseline entropy profile expected from gravitational structure formation alone and then allowed that gas to cool for a hubble time within a navarro - frenk - white potential @xcite .",
    "the inner temperature profiles predicted by that pure cooling model ( the @xmath23 model in the lingo of @xcite ) were shown to be quite similar to those of clusters suspected to harbor strong cooling flows , suggesting that cooling indeed plays an important role in determining their core entropy structure ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite show that cooling - flow clusters do not actually relax to the pure - cooling profile .",
    "instead , they appear to asymptotically approach it at @xmath24  kpc . meanwhile , the inner entropy profiles of these clusters flatten out at the @xmath25 level , a clue to the form of heat input that hinders cooling and condensation .",
    "assuming pure free - free cooling , one can write a simple relation between entropy , cooling time , and gas temperature : @xmath26 the central flattening of these clusters entropy profiles therefore suggests that they will not require feedback to halt cooling until @xmath0 years from now . in that respect ,",
    "the clusters in the @xcite sample follow a trend first noticed in hydra  a by @xcite .",
    "heating would therefore seem to be episodic @xcite .",
    "however , in order to maintain the quasi - steady nature of these profiles , the maximum entropy input in a typical heating event can not be much greater than @xmath27 .",
    "otherwise the cluster core would linger at much higher entropy levels , because it takes much longer to cool from a high - entropy state , owing to the steeper - than - linear dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath29 .",
    "the dashed line in figure  [ profs+mod+10 ] shows that simply adding a constant @xmath30 entropy pedestal to the pure cooling model produces a reasonable facsimile to the observed profiles out to @xmath31 , another clue to the mode of heat input .",
    "the structure of these cluster cores from @xmath32 can be approximated with a simple power - law model that will be useful when we consider heat input .",
    "figure  1 shows that the entropy profiles in this range are approximately @xmath33 , and the temperature gradients at these radii in cooling - flow clusters typically have a power - law slope @xmath34 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "combining these facts , we can reverse - engineer the observed density profile @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the gas temperature 100  kpc from the cluster center in units of 5  kev .",
    "the product @xmath37 is therefore approximately constant in this radial range , and is consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "before we discuss heat input , we have a comment on this power - law model .",
    "notice that the gas temperature drops by a factor of two from 100 kpc to 10 kpc .",
    "inside of 10 kpc , the gas temperature must then level off , and may even rise a little , if the gas within 10 kpc is isentropic .",
    "thus , a heating mechanism that maintains an inner entropy plateau at @xmath25 for long periods of time would account for the spectroscopic finding that gas temperatures in the centers of cooling - flow clusters drop to about half the ambient temperature , even in a quasi - static configuration in which there is little net cooling .",
    "consider how an energetic outburst from an agn heats gas with this power - law configuration .",
    "an outflow with a kinetic power output @xmath38 shock - heats the innermost portions of the core .",
    "even if the flow is bipolar , an ellipsoidal cocoon of shocked intracluster gas develops around the outflow , distributing heat through @xmath39 steradians ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the outflow shuts down after @xmath40 years , the energy introduced , amounting to a few times @xmath41 , continues to drive the shock until it becomes subsonic .",
    "the hot bubbles inflated by the outflow then become buoyant , floating away from the center and gradually thermalizing the @xmath42 work they exert on their surroundings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we show that the entropy boosts imparted by a series of such episodic heating events are broadly consistent with the observed entropy profiles of cooling - flow clusters .",
    "we can estimate the entropy introduced during the outflow - driven stage using the scaling behavior of an outflow - driven bubble and an entropy jump condition .",
    "the shock velocity of such a bubble scales as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a structure factor of order unity that depends on the outflow geometry and the preshock density profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to assess the entropy created by this shock , we apply the approximate entropy jump condition @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the pre- and post - shock entropy levels , respectively , and @xmath11 is the preshock electron density @xcite . for the purposes of this estimate",
    ", we will ignore the insignificant @xmath48 term .",
    "the entropy increase @xmath49 induced by such an outflow - driven shock in a medium with a constant value of @xmath50 is then independent of radius , with @xmath51 .",
    "its physical value in the power - law core model of  [ sec - coreprofs ] is @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "this mode of entropy injection has the very attractive feature of introducing a constant entropy boost throughout the shock - heated zone , as suggested by the observations .",
    "outflow - driven shocks create no entropy inversions and therefore do not induce the kinds of mixing that would destroy the iron gradients that have built up in cooling - flow clusters . after the shock passes and",
    "the gas settles back into equilibrium , the stratification of the cluster core remains the same because the ordering of specific entropy among gas parcels has not changed .",
    "if this is indeed the primary mode of entropy injection within the centers of clusters , then the observed @xmath25 entropy plateau implies a kinetic power output @xmath1 during each heating event .",
    "such an outflow - driven shock heats a region extending to a radius @xmath54 from the center , where @xmath55 is the timescale of the outburst , and the shock s mach number is @xmath56 , implying that it can remain supersonic to a radius @xmath57 in the power - law medium we have assumed .",
    "after the kinetic outflow shuts off , the deposited energy , @xmath58 , can drive the shock , if the front is still supersonic .",
    "the velocity of an energy - driven shock is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is another structure factor analogous to @xmath44 , leading to an entropy boost @xmath61 . in the power - law core model",
    ", this entropy boost declines with radius : @xmath62 making the reasonable assumption that @xmath63 , one finds that the energy - driven shock becomes subsonic at @xmath64 notice that this form of entropy injection will cause an entropy inversion if the outburst is too powerful and too brief .",
    "that happens because an energy - driven shock slows down more quickly than an outflow - driven shock , raising the innermost gas to a higher entropy level than gas farther from the center .",
    "boosting the entropy level in the inner @xmath65 of a cluster by a uniform @xmath25 is therefore most naturally done by an outburst lasting several times @xmath2 years .",
    "once the outer shock front becomes subsonic , the plasma bubble inflated by the agn outflow will buoyantly rise through the intracluster medium . inflating the bubble",
    "has lifted some of the intracluster medium , increasing its gravitational potential energy by an amount corresponding to the work required to inflate the bubble .",
    "as the bubble subsequently rises , the gas around the bubble falls . assuming that the falling gas locally thermalizes that liberated gravitational potential energy , one finds that the bubble introduces heat energy amounting to @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the bubble volume , into each radial interval @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the amount of additional work a bubble does as it rises and expands , keeping @xmath69 constant , depends on the polytropic index @xmath70 of its contents .",
    "if the bubble remains coherent as it ascends , it distributes the energy @xmath71 required to create it according to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the radius at which the bubble is injected and @xmath74 , equaling 1/6 if the bubble contents are relativistic and 4/15 if they are non - relativistic . here",
    "we will assume that bubbles are injected at the radius @xmath75 where the shock driven by the outburst becomes subsonic .",
    "those rising bubbles can generate additional entropy by causing turbulence that mixes low - entropy gas from the cluster core with the higher - entropy gas lying above it .",
    "however , we will not consider mixing processes here because they do not increase the total amount of thermal energy in the intracluster medium .",
    "heating the gas by an amount @xmath76 per particle augments its specific entropy by @xmath77 , implying @xmath78 .",
    "the total amount of bubble heating per particle from a single outburst is @xmath79 implying that the entropy boost in the bubble - heated zone is @xmath80 . defining @xmath81 to be the fraction of the input energy left in bubble form",
    "when the shock becomes subsonic , we obtain the following expression for bubble heating as a function of radius in the power - law core model @xmath82 like an energy - driven shock , this form of heating will also cause an entropy inversion if too much bubble energy is injected at too small a radius because its entropy injection profile falls even more rapidly with radius than the profile for the energy - driven shock .",
    "a single agn outburst thus generically heats the cluster core in three zones , an inner outflow - driven zone , an intermediate energy - driven zone , and an outer bubble - heated zone .",
    "disturbances moving at the sound speed propagate to 100  kpc in @xmath0 years , during which time the inner regions relax to a new equilibrium configuration with slightly elevated entropy and resume cooling . in order to evaluate the net entropy change over a single cycle of heating and cooling",
    ", we will first determine the entropy losses due to radiative cooling during this time interval and then compare those losses to the entropy boost from a single outburst .    a radiative loss rate of @xmath83 carries entropy away from a plasma of ion density @xmath84 at the rate @xmath85 n_e^{1/3 } \\lambda ( t)$ ] .",
    "pure free - free cooling therefore removes an entropy @xmath86 during a time interval @xmath87 , given the simple power - law model we have been using for the core gas configuration . notice",
    "that if outflow - driven shock heating can compensate for cooling at small radii , then heating and cooling will remain nearly balanced out to @xmath88 because of the weak dependence of @xmath89 on radius .",
    "however , in the power - law core model , cooling will dominate heating at @xmath90 over the course of one cycle because both energy - driven shock heating and bubble heating fall off more quickly with radius than cooling .",
    "thus , in order for heating to compensate for cooling throughout the @xmath91 region where the cooling time is less than a hubble time , the outflow - driven zone must be relatively large , implying that outbursts capable of stopping a cooling flow indeed last several times @xmath2 years .",
    "figure  [ delk_pl ] illustrates this idea in the context of the power - law core model .",
    "solid lines show the net entropy change over the course of a single cycle of heating and cooling for outbursts lasting @xmath2 years .",
    "two different cases are shown , corresponding to entropy boosts of @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the outflow - driven zone .",
    "outside of that , in the energy - driven zone , the boost in each case is @xmath94 , where @xmath88 is given by equation  ( [ eq - rl ] ) with @xmath95 .",
    "this zone extends to @xmath75 as given by equation  ( [ eq - rsse ] ) , and beyond that point bubble heating is assumed to raise the entropy by @xmath96 , so that the entropy jump is continuous across @xmath75 .",
    "the validity of that assumption depends on the structure factors @xmath44 , @xmath60 , and @xmath97 and needs to be checked with numerical simulations .",
    "the power - law index in radius here applies to the relativistic bubble case , but the non - relativistic case is virtually the same , with an @xmath98 dependence .",
    "because the time interval between heating episodes depends on the entropy boost at small radii , we choose @xmath87 so that heating matches radiative losses at a radius of 2  kpc . outside of that radius , the net entropy gain is several kev  @xmath99 out to about @xmath88 , where there is a sharp turnaround . beyond about 30  kpc",
    "the net entropy change is negative , even for a central entropy boost of 20  kev  @xmath99 .",
    "the dashed lines show how the picture changes when an outburst lasts long enough for @xmath88 to equal @xmath75 as given by equation  ( [ eq - rssl ] ) .",
    "then the outflow - driven zone extends much farther , and in the case of a 20 kev  @xmath99 boost , heating can exceed cooling out to @xmath24  kpc . the time required for an outflow - driven shock to reach @xmath75 is @xmath100 in the 10 kev  @xmath99 case and @xmath101 in the 20 kev  @xmath99 case .",
    "a slightly more refined picture emerges when we take the core structure at the time of the outburst to be that of the pure cooling model of voit et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , corresponding to the solid line in figure  [ profs+mod+10 ] . in that model of the core ,",
    "gas density starts to drop with radius more rapidly than @xmath102 outside of @xmath3  kpc , gradually increasing the efficiency with which all forms of heating increase the entropy .",
    "figure  [ delk_mod78 ] shows models in which the entropy boost from the outburst is a continuous piecewise power law that is @xmath103 in the outflow - driven zone , @xmath104 in the energy - driven zone , and @xmath105 in the bubble - heated zone .",
    "boundaries between the zones are the same as those used for figure  [ delk_pl ] .",
    "the entropy boost is normalized so that @xmath49 at 2  kpc takes values of 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30  kev  @xmath99 , and cooling is assumed to match heating at that radius .",
    "solid lines show models for outbursts lasting @xmath2 years , and dashed lines show models for outbursts long enough for the outflow - driven zone to reach the radius at which the shock becomes subsonic .",
    "the simple models illustrated in figure  [ delk_mod78 ] suggest that episodic outbursts that impart @xmath106 to the central regions of a cluster and last until the shock reaches @xmath3  kpc can compensate for radiative cooling throughout an entire cluster . in all the models , heating balances cooling from 1  kpc to 5  kpc with a high precision that is likely to be coincidental ,",
    "given the crudity of the model .",
    "outside of 5  kpc , the net entropy gain per cycle rises out to the outer radius of the outflow - driven zone , beyond which the net entropy gain declines because the shock decelerates more quickly there .",
    "the sharp cusp appearing at the transition to the energy - driven zone is an artifact of the piecewise power - law model for heating ; a more realistic model would have a more gradual turnover . beyond @xmath107 , in the bubble - heated zone",
    ", the net entropy change climbs again with radius because the gas density profile gradually steepens there , approaching @xmath108 beyond the cluster core .",
    "the entropy gain outside the core from bubble heating is therefore @xmath109 , which is nearly constant with radius .",
    "however , bubble heating operates out there only if the bubbles can remain coherent over many pressure scale heights , requiring some sort of stabilizing mechanism to ward off hydrodynamic shredding ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one intriguing possibility suggested by figure  [ delk_mod78 ] is that the characteristic minimum entropy level of @xmath25 in cluster cores is determined by the minimum agn outburst required to halt a cooling flow .",
    "all the cluster entropy profiles in figure  [ profs+mod+10 ] flatten at roughly this level even though the clusters range over a factor more than three in temperature .",
    "our analysis indicates that agn outbursts unable to heat the central regions to this level are also not powerful enough to push outflow - driven shocks to @xmath3  kpc , the necessary inner radius for either energy - driven shocks or bubble heating to compensate for radiative cooling in the outer parts of a cluster s core ( @xmath110  kpc ) .",
    "this feature of our simple model suggests that the agn feedback mechanism may have become tuned over time so that cooling is kept marginal ( see * ? ? ? * for an example of such a mechanism ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the consistency among the inner entropy levels in the sample of donahue et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is a selection effect , because clusters with the lowest central entropy levels will appear to have the strongest cooling flows .",
    "it could be that outbursts of kinetic energy from a cluster s central agn outbursts vary greatly in power , sometimes imparting entropy boosts several times greater than @xmath111 . in that case , however , one would expect a large fraction of clusters to have elevated central entropy levels because it would take much longer for radiative cooling to reduce the central entropy in those clusters .",
    "now we will briefly consider the evolution of the intracluster medium over time in the context of this simple framework for agn heating .",
    "in general , one would not expect precise balance between agn heating and radiative cooling throughout the cluster core because the conditions governing accretion at @xmath112  kpc are not closely linked to those at @xmath24  kpc .",
    "a common feature of the outburst models presented here is that heating exceeds cooling in the outer parts of the outflow - driven zone , and that excess can persist well beyond the outflow - driven zone if bubble heating is effective .",
    "one therefore expects entropy to accumulate over time in the @xmath113  kpc range , if the outbursts are strong enough to prevent net cooling everywhere outside of @xmath114  kpc .",
    "evidence for such an accumulation of entropy is present in figure  [ profs+mod+10 ] .",
    "the entropy profiles shown there tend to exceed the pure - cooling model by @xmath115 at @xmath24  kpc .",
    "the models we have constructed here are too crude for a detailed comparison with that excess to be fruitful .",
    "statistical variations in the duration and kinetic power of the outbursts will cause the size of the outflow - driven zone to differ from outburst to outburst , and the shape of that zone is likely to be elongated , owing to the asymmetry of the outbursts .",
    "neither of those features are represented in our spherically - symmetric , single - outburst models .",
    "nevertheless , a generic prediction of this framework is that highly energetic outbursts should limit the total accumulation of entropy at large radii over the course of several billion years . from equation  ( [ eq - ctime ] ) for the cooling time from a given entropy level , one infers that the maximum number of outbursts that can occur over a time period @xmath116 is @xmath117 if each outburst imparts an entropy boost @xmath49 in the outflow - driven zone .",
    "thus , several tens of @xmath25 outbursts can occur , but only a few at the @xmath115 level .",
    "if the excess entropy introduced at large radii by a single outburst is @xmath118 , then the accumulated excess entropy arising from a series of such outbursts is @xmath119 .",
    "however , an adequate calibration of the relation between the central entropy input from an outburst and the corresponding excess entropy it produces will require high - resolution numerical simulations .    in principle",
    ", it may be possible to use the excess entropy observed in the outer regions of clusters to constrain the outburst history .",
    "figure  [ delk_mod78 ] indicates that each outburst incrementally deposits several kev  @xmath99 at @xmath1201  mpc , where cooling is negligible , as long as bubble heating still operates at such large radii .",
    "for example , suppose a series of @xmath121 outbursts were to introduce @xmath122 at @xmath114  mpc with each outburst , as suggested by figure  [ delk_mod78 ] .",
    "roughly thirty such outbursts could occur in a @xmath123  kev cluster over a period of 5  gyr , according to equation  ( [ eq - nbursts ] ) , leading to an accumulated excess entropy @xmath124 at large radii .",
    "the entropy excesses seen in the outer parts of @xmath125 clusters @xcite might therefore result from the cumulative effects of bubble heating during the cluster s lifetime ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in even smaller systems with temperatures",
    "@xmath112  kev , excess entropy that accumulates at @xmath126  kpc may come to dominate the gravitationally produced entropy . because these systems have smaller core radii than clusters",
    ", agn outbursts can penetrate more easily to radii beyond @xmath3  kpc , depositing more entropy there .",
    "thus , the `` entropy deficit '' observed in the outskirts of groups by @xcite might not be an actual deficit in the gravitationally produced entropy but rather just a deficit with respect to a large entropy excess of non - gravitational origin that has built up near the core radius .",
    "the dramatic heating event observed in ms0735 + 7421 by @xcite inspires us to add one more wrinkle to this framework for agn heating .",
    "so far , we have considered only outbursts of @xmath1 lasting significantly less than @xmath127 years , but ms0735 + 7421 appears to have been sustaining a kinetic power output @xmath128 for @xmath0  years .",
    "the observed central entropy level of @xmath129 is consistent with a constant - power outburst at this level , given a structure factor @xmath130 , and corresponds to a central cooling time @xmath114  gyr at the central temperature of 3  kev . in those respects ms0735",
    "+ 7421 is similar to the two radio - quiet cooling - core clusters observed by @xcite , which also have @xmath131 entropy levels and @xmath114  gyr central cooling times , suggesting that these clusters are what ms0735 + 7421 will look like a few hundred million years from now .",
    "if that is the case , then instances of powerful , sustained outflows from agns in clusters might not be all that rare and should be incorporated into the overall framework for agn heating .    how much longer the energetic outflow in ms0735 + 7421 will persist is anyone s guess , but its effects on the cluster s overall entropy profile are likely to be profound and lasting . the outflow has already propagated to a radius @xmath132  kpc , leaving the cluster core and entering the region where gas density is steepening to a @xmath108 density profile . an interesting feature of an outflow - driven shock in a medium with that density distribution is that it propagates at constant velocity , generating an entropy boost that is proportional to the original entropy , i.e. @xmath133 is constant . a sustained , high - power outflow therefore raises the outer entropy profile of a cluster by a constant factor , preserving its shape .",
    "that sort of entropy boost is particularly interesting in light of _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations showing that the outer entropy profiles of low - temperature clusters have shapes similar to those of hotter clusters but have unexpectedly large normalizations , indicating that some non - gravitational process has elevated the entropy by a constant factor throughout the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "one suggested possibility for causing this global entropy boost is that early galactic winds smoothed the intergalactic medium of the protocluster before the cluster formed , thereby amplifying the amount of entropy generated in the cluster s accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "however , simulations of entropy amplification suggest that supernova - driven winds have trouble generating enough smoothing to account for the observed entropy excesses @xcite . smoothing by agns",
    "might be required , or maybe it is possible for the central agn to produce the entire entropy excess through large outbursts alone .    in order to assess the large - scale impact of heating events like that in ms0735 + 7421 , we can consider an idealized cluster model in which the cluster atmosphere has @xmath108 everywhere .",
    "taking the baryon fraction to equal the global value gives @xmath134 , where @xmath12 is now the mean temperature of the cluster .",
    "the entropy boost produced in that density profile by a sustained outburst of kinetic power output is @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "in other words , the outburst event in ms0735 + 7421 is destined to raise its global entropy profile by @xmath137% , depending on the structure factor @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , lower - temperature clusters are subject to even larger global boosts , implying that strong , sustained outbursts of agn heating could be a substantial contributor , maybe even the dominant contributor , to the entropy excesses observed at large radii in low - temperature clusters .",
    "in this paper we have outlined a framework for agn heating of cluster cores inspired by the observed core entropy profiles of cooling - flow clusters @xcite .",
    "we have focused primarily on entropy rather than on density or temperature , because entropy is the quantity most directly affected by heat input and radiative losses .",
    "tracking entropy changes allows one to predict , at least qualitatively , how an outburst of agn energy becomes distributed with radius in the intracluster medium . applying these simple predictions to the observed distributions of entropy , temperature , and density in cluster cores",
    "indicates how the entropy at each radius should change over a single cycle of outburst heating and radiative cooling .",
    "the picture we arrive at from considering the time - dependent behavior of these core entropy profiles has much in common with other agn - heating models that were inspired by other aspects of clusters with cool cores , especially the x - ray cavities often found there .",
    "here we summarize the agn - heating framework that emerges from considerations of intracluster entropy .      1",
    ".   the profiles observed by @xcite are very similar to one another when plotted as functions of radius in unscaled physical units , even though the clusters range over a more than a factor of three in temperature .",
    "power - law fits to these profiles show that @xmath138 with @xmath139 , and the normalizations of the profiles are consistent with earlier indications that entropy at a fixed fraction of the virial radius is @xmath22 , where @xmath15 is the characteristic temperature of the cluster s halo @xcite .",
    "a power - law model with @xmath33 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 is a reasonable approximation to the gas configuration from @xmath142  kpc to @xmath24  kpc .",
    "2 .   in the outer regions of these cluster cores , the entropy profiles appear to approach the pure - cooling cluster model of @xcite , in which a cluster whose initial configuration is determined by hierarchical structure formation",
    "is allowed to cool for a hubble time without feedback .",
    "the pure - cooling model is apparently a bounding lower envelope to the allowed set of entropy profiles .",
    "the inner regions of these profiles flatten out at an entropy level @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , simply adding an entropy pedestal of @xmath30 to the pure - cooling model at all radii reproduces the observed shape of these profiles at radii from @xmath114  kpc to @xmath143  kpc .",
    "this inner entropy minimum corresponds to a cooling time @xmath0  years , suggesting that the heating mechanism producing the entropy pedestal is episodic on roughly this timescale ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if agn heating is indeed episodic , then the relatively strong power - law dependence of cooling time on entropy implies that the central entropy level remains near its maximum value during most of the time period between feedback episodes .",
    "thus , typical agn heating events probably impart @xmath144 in the central parts of the core .",
    "because the entropy pedestal introduced by a heating episode persists over most of the cycle , the central temperature gradient should remain approximately flat within @xmath142  kpc , which corresponds to a temperature that is approximately one - half the value at @xmath24  kpc , given the @xmath140 temperature gradient outside of 10  kpc ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the lower bound to the gas temperatures observed in cooling - flow clusters arises in a quasi - steady hydrostatic configuration with an inner entropy floor and reflects the potential - well depth in the region where the entropy distribution flattens .",
    "in addition to these features of the entropy profiles , the strong iron abundance gradients seen in the cores of cooling - flow clusters provide another important constraint on the heating mechanism : it can not induce too much mixing in the core .",
    "otherwise , it would wipe out the observed gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      1 .",
    "an agn outburst with a constant kinetic power output naturally produces a constant entropy pedestal if it propagates into a medium with @xmath141 . raising the inner entropy by @xmath25 requires outbursts of @xmath145 , given the values of @xmath146 observed in the cores of cooling - flow clusters .",
    "this mode of heating is particularly attractive because a boost in entropy that is constant with radius does not produce entropy inversions , which are not generally observed and would induce convection , mixing , and reduction of the central iron gradient .",
    "2 .   in order to produce an entropy pedestal extending to @xmath3  kpc , as suggested by the observed profiles , an outburst sufficient to raise the central entropy by @xmath25 needs to last several times @xmath2 years . shorter bursts pump too much outburst energy into too small a volume , leading to entropy inversions , because both energy - driven shocks and bubble heating produce entropy boosts that decline with radius in a medium where @xmath141 .",
    "3 .   the leading shock of an outburst that raises the central entropy by @xmath25 and lasts for @xmath147   years will become subsonic and decay to sound waves in the neighborhood of @xmath3  kpc from the center .",
    "at that point the hot bubble of ejected material that was driving the shock can become buoyant .",
    "if the intracluster medium efficiently thermalizes the work done by that bubble as it rises , then it can offset cooling at large radii in the core @xcite .",
    "small bubbles can be just as effective as large ones , as long as the total amount of initial bubble energy is the same @xcite .",
    "one can therefore compute the entropy injected at all radii by an outburst , given the size of the central entropy boost and the duration of the outburst , under the assumption that the bubbles remain coherent as they rise .",
    "4 .   assuming that the outbursts are regulated by the need for heating to balance radiative cooling at small radii over the course of an outburst cycle determines the net entropy change at all radii from a single cycle .",
    "the size of the central entropy boost determines the number of outburst cycles that can occur during the life of a cluster , and therefore regulates the accumulation of excess entropy at larger radii .",
    "5 .   in order for bubble heating to exceed cooling in the outer parts of the core over the course of a cycle",
    ", the inner radius of the bubble - heated region must be @xmath143  kpc . that requirement places a lower limit @xmath148 on the size of the central entropy boosts .",
    "weaker outflows do not extend the base of the bubble - heated zone to a sufficiently large radius .",
    "this feature of cluster cores may explain the ubiquity of the @xmath25 pedestal .",
    "perhaps the feedback mechanism has become tuned over time to produce outbursts with power output and duration sufficient to ward off cooling catastrophes",
    ". 6 .   outside the cluster core , the gas density profile steepens to @xmath108 , thereby increasing the efficiency of entropy production .",
    "sustained outbursts with constant kinetic power output can therefore produce entropy boosts for which @xmath149 is constant with radius , raising the previous entropy profile by a constant factor without changing its shape .",
    "an outburst power of @xmath150 , such as that observed in ms0735 + 7421 , can raise the outer entropy profile of a 5  kev cluster by @xmath137% , and the boosts in lower - temperature clusters can be substantially greater .",
    "strong agn outbursts can therefore potentially account for the elevated outer entropy profiles of low - temperature clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the picture that emerges from consideration of the core entropy profiles alone calls for outbursts that deposit a total energy @xmath151 every @xmath0  years , corresponding to a time - averaged agn power output of several times @xmath152 with a duty cycle @xmath153% . dividing this energy between two bubbles , each requiring an energy of @xmath154 to produce",
    ", implies that @xmath155 in each bubble .",
    "all of these characteristics are remarkably consistent with the properties of agn outbursts inferred from x - ray cavities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    further progress within this framework will require numerical simulations to determine the actual entropy boost imparted by a single outburst as a function of radius , given an initial configuration for the core .",
    "there has already been a substantial amount of work in this area , ranging over a wide volume of parameter space in kinetic power , outburst duration , and core configuration at the time of the outburst ( recent papers include * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the analysis we have presented indicates the most fruitful area of this parameter space to explore in future work , while strengthening the case for episodic agn outbursts as the mechanism that limits cooling and condensation in cooling - flow clusters at the present time and therefore the growth of the largest galaxies in the universe .",
    "a complete picture of the intracluster medium will also need to account for earlier processing of a cluster s intergalactic gas by cooling and supernova feedback during the epoch of galaxy formation , whose effects can be amplified by accretion shocks as the cluster forms @xcite .",
