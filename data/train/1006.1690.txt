    "transmission technology has attracted growing attention due to its promising capability of extending cell coverage and increasing cell capacity of wireless communication systems .",
    "so far , most relay technologies have been developed under the half - duplex constraint @xcite that prevents relays from transmitting and receiving at the same time .",
    "although this form of relay , called half - duplex relay ( hdr ) , is easy to implement , it requires partitioning of resource for transmission and reception , reducing the whole system capacity .    in order to overcome the drawback of hdr",
    ", we consider a full - duplex relay ( fdr ) that is able to transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time @xcite , where it is crucial to reduce the effect of possibly strong self - interference caused by its own transmitter to its own receiver . in order to solve the self - interference problem , @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied the physical isolation between the transmit and receive antennas at the rs . since the antenna isolation may not be enough for stable fdr operation , @xcite-@xcite",
    "have suggested signal processing techniques to suppress the residual self - interference . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested spatial interference suppression schemes that exploit multiple transmit and receive antennas at the rs .",
    "however , the need for multiple antennas at the relay increases the complexity and cost of the relay , which may become a huge barrier for deploying relay stations in wireless networks .",
    "we propose an fdr that works under a multiuser mimo scenario , where we need to suppress the multiuser interference as well as the self - interference in the fdr .",
    "we exploit a zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) in @xcite using multiple antennas at the base station ( bs ) rather than at the relay station ( rs ) .",
    "it should be noted that the zfbf is applied to cancel the self - interference of the fdr as well as to support multiuser mimo .",
    "moreover , the need for multiple antennas at the rs is eliminated by letting the bs perform the self - interference cancellation .",
    "the performance of the proposed fdr will be compared with that of an hdr with zfbf and an ordinary multiuser mimo without rs .",
    "we consider a downlink scenario where the bs has @xmath0 transmit antennas and a rs has one receive antenna and one transmit antenna . the rs is assumed to employ the decode - and - forward protocol @xcite , where the rs decodes all the signals from the bs and forwards them to the ms .",
    "we categorize mobile stations ( ms s ) , each assumed to be equipped with one receive antenna , into two groups according to the reachability of the signals from the bs : 1 ) ms s in the first group can receive the signals from both the bs and rs .",

    "moreover , we assume that the bs selects the ms s from each ms group so that the sum rate is maximized @xcite .    the received signal @xmath3 at the @xmath4-th ms in the ms-@xmath2 , @xmath5 , is respectively given as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes a @xmath8 channel vector between the bs and the @xmath4-th ms in ms-1 .",

    "when generating @xmath10 at the bs and @xmath14 at the rs , the total available transmit power is assumed to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the signal transmission at the bs and rs is assumed to occur every time slot , the duration of which is assumed to be normalized to the unity .",
    "although our main interest is in the fdr with zfbf , the hdr transmission can also accommodate a zfbf . for fair comparison between the hdr and fdr ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a full - duplex relay ( fdr ) based on a zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) for a multiuser mimo relay system . </S>",
    "<S> the zfbf is employed at the base station to suppress both the self - interference of the relay and the multiuser interference at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that the proposed fdr can enhance the sum rate performance as compared to the half - duplex relay ( hdr ) , if sufficient isolation between the transmit and receive antennas is ensured at the relay .    </S>",
