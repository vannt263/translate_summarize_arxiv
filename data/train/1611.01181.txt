    "the wide spectrum of layered two - dimensional materials provides the opportunity to create ultimately thin devices with functionalities that can not be achieved with standard semiconductors .",
    "the simplest of such devices is the field effect transistor ( fet ) .",
    "there are several factors which determine the performance of an fet , key among them being the dielectric environment , quality of the metal - semiconductor contact , and the level of low - frequency @xmath2 noise . over the past few years",
    "there has been tremendous progress in creating high mobility , atomically thin fets through a combination of low resistance ohmic contacts  @xcite and strategies for encapsulation  @xcite of the active channel .",
    "however , there exists no consensus on the factors which determine the magnitude of the @xmath2 noise , which is known to degrade the performance of amplifiers , or introduce phase noise / jitter in high frequency oscillators and converters  @xcite .",
    "noise is especially detrimental to the performance of nanoscale devices and may cause variability even in ballistic transistor channels , where it has been suggested to arise from slow fluctuations in the electrostatic environment of the metal - semiconductor contacts  @xcite .    even for the widely studied graphene fet",
    "it is still unclear what the dominant contribution is to the @xmath2 noise .",
    "conflicting claims exist , where some studies attribute the @xmath2-noise in graphene transistors primarily to noise generated within the channel region  @xcite , whereas other investigations indicate a strong contribution from the contacts  @xcite .",
    "this distinction has remained elusive to existing studies  @xcite due to the lack of a microscopic understanding of how processes characteristic to the metal - graphene junctions , in particular the current crowding effect  @xcite , impact the nature and magnitude of @xmath2 noise .",
    "fundamentally , current crowding is an unavoidable consequence of resistivity mismatch at the metal - semiconductor junction , where the injection and/or scattering of charge carriers between the semiconductor and the metal contact is restricted only close to the edge of the contact , over the charge transfer length @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "photocurrent measurements  @xcite and kelvin probe microscopy  @xcite at the graphene - metal interface have already indicated the presence of current crowding with @xmath4 m  @xcite . restricting the effective current injection area leads to greater impact of local disorder kinetics , and hence larger @xmath2 noise  @xcite . for graphene - metal interfaces ,",
    "the scenario is more complex than a typical metal - semiconductor junction , since it is known that metals such as cr , pd , and ti react to form metal carbides with graphene , altering the structural properties and causing strong modifications in its energy band dispersion  @xcite . while it is clear that current crowding and the characteristics of the metal - graphene junction directly influence the contact resistance  @xcite , how these factors impact the noise originating at the contacts ( contact noise ) is still not known .    in this work",
    "we study a series of graphene fets with different mobilities , substrates and contacting configurations to demonstrate that electrical noise at the metal - graphene junction can be the dominant source of @xmath2 noise in graphene fets , especially for invasive contacting geometry , where the probe contacts lie directly in the path of the current flow .",
    "the contact noise was found to scale as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the contact resistance , in all devices and at all temperatures . while the noise magnitude is determined by the fluctuating charge trap potential at the oxide substrate underneath the metal contacts",
    ", a simple phenomenological model unambiguously attributes the scaling to the current crowding effect at the metal - graphene junction . in view of the recent observations of contact noise  @xcite and",
    "current crowding effect in molybdenum disulphide ( mos@xmath7 ) and black phosphorus fets  @xcite , many of the results and concepts developed in this paper can be extended to other members of 2d semiconductor family as well .",
    "* characterization of au - contacted graphene .",
    "* we first focus on a single layer graphene channel on conventional ( 300  nm ) sio@xmath8-si substrate , etched into a hall bar shape with surface - contacted au ( 99.999% ) leads ( fig .",
    "here we used pure gold contact ( without a wetting underlayer of , _",
    "e.g. _ cr or pd ) because gold ( hole ) dopes the graphene underneath without pinning the fermi energy , or causing substantial modification in the bandstructure  @xcite .",
    "this allows easy tuning of the doping , and correspondingly the resistance , of the contact region with backgate voltage ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we measure the two probe ( @xmath10 ) and four probe ( @xmath11 ) resistance and noise as a function of @xmath9 between the leads 2 and 3 ( suffixes in @xmath12 indicate the voltage ( @xmath13 ) and current ( @xmath14 ) leads ) .",
    "the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath16 shows a slightly asymmetric transfer characteristics , known to occur for asymmetric contact doping  @xcite , with a single dirac point at @xmath17  v. @xmath15 , however , shows a second dirac point at @xmath18  v , due to the combination of hole doping and weak pinning by au at the contact region  @xcite , which divides the transfer behavior in three parts ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , based on the sign of doping in the channel and contact regions . the position of the fermi level at the two dirac points is shown in the schematic of fig .",
    "the observation of double dirac point in @xmath22 characteristics confirms the structural integrity and gate - tunability of the fermi level of the graphene channel underneath the contact .",
    "[ figure2 ]    * contact resistance with au - contacts and current crowding * the shift in the local chemical potential by metal contacts results in a change in resistance that contributes to contact resistance , and determines the extent of current crowding at the gold - graphene interface . to compute the contact resistance @xmath6",

    "the agreement , both in @xmath9-dependence and absolute magnitude ( within 50% for all @xmath9 ) , indicates that the contact resistance is primarily composed of the resistance @xmath27 of the graphene layer over the charge transfer length ( @xmath3 ) underneath the contacts . due to mismatch between the resistivities of the metal and graphene",
    ", @xmath3 is significantly smaller than the geometric width @xmath28 ( @xmath29 m ) of the metal lead , resulting in the current crowding effect .    to visualize this quantitatively",
    ", we consider the transmission line model where the graphene layer below the contacts is represented with a network of resistors characterized by sheet resistivity @xmath30 ( schematic in fig .",
    "the potential profile in graphene under the metal is then given by  @xcite ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the current flowing , @xmath33  @xmath34m@xmath35  @xcite is the specific contact resistivity , and @xmath36 is charge transfer length from the edge by which @xmath37 of the current is transferred to the metal contact ( @xmath38 is the contact width ) .",

    "1d ) , we calculated the potential drop underneath the contact , normalized to its value at the edge @xmath39 , for three gate voltages marked by the arrows in fig",
    "the potential drops exponentially over the gate voltage - dependent scale @xmath3 , being minimum ( @xmath40  nm ) for the second dirac point at @xmath41  v where the mismatch between the resistivity of the metal and that of the graphene layer underneath is maximum .    since @xmath42  @xcite and @xmath43 , it is evident that the contact noise is essentially the resistance fluctuations in the graphene layer underneath the contact , _",

    "@xmath45 is independent of @xmath46 and is determined by the kinetics of local disorder induced by trapped charges , chemical modifications and changes in the band dispersion due to hybridization . assuming a diffusive transport in the charge transfer region with density - independent mobility  @xcite",
    ", the contact noise can be expressed as ,    @xmath47    and implies a scaling relation @xmath48 , that can be readily verified experimentally .",
    "note that : ( 1 ) the scaling is different from that suggested for metal and 3d semiconductors where the exponent of @xmath6 is @xmath49 for interface - type contacts or @xmath50 for constriction - type contacts  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) since @xmath46 is the only gate - tunable parameter  @xcite , the scaling of contact resistance and electrical noise can be dynamically monitored by varying the gate voltage , circumventing the necessity to examine multiple pairs of contacts to isolate the contact contribution to noise .",

    "( [ contact ] ) is expected to hold irrespective of the geometry , material or chemical nature of the contact ( wetting or non - wetting ) .    * noise measurement in au - contacted graphene * noise in both @xmath15 and @xmath16 at all @xmath9 consists of random time dependent fluctuations with power spectral density @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "2a ) , where @xmath52 indicates usual @xmath2-noise due to many independent fluctuators with wide distribution of characteristic switching rates .",

    "1b and e ) .",
    "the origin of the maximum in noise at the dirac point is a debated topic , and has often been attributed to low screening ability of the graphene channel to fluctuating coulomb potential at the channel - substrate interface  @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath56 peaks in the @xmath20 region close to @xmath58  v , where the density of states in the charge transfer region is low  @xcite , indicating contact noise that originates due to poorly screened fluctuations in the local coulomb disorder .",
    "in fact , the noise magnitude at the second peak ( @xmath59  v ) is @xmath60 times larger than that at the main dirac peak , indicating the significantly larger noise where the current crowding is most severe and contact resistance is the largest . surprisingly , @xmath57 shows a weak increase in this regime as well , suggesting a leakage of the noise at the contacts even in four probe measurements ( discussed in more detail in the context of fig .",
    "3c and in the supplementary note  3 ) .    to verify the contact origin of noise , we have plotted @xmath56 as a function of contact resistance @xmath6 in fig .",
    "remarkably , @xmath56 for all @xmath9 collapses on a single trace , and varies as @xmath61 over four decades of noise magnitude , suggesting that the measured noise in two - probe configuration originates almost entirely at the contacts , which is at least a factor of @xmath62 higher than the channel noise @xmath57 ( circles in fig .",
    "similar behavior was observed over a wide temperature range as shown in the inset of fig .  2c . in order to analyze the channel contribution to noise ,",

    "a 5  nm cr underlayer was used with 50  nm au films as contact material in all these devices .",
    "the details of the device fabrication process are given in the methods section and supplementary note  1 .",
    "similar to the au contacted device , the noise measurements were performed from 80  k to room temperature and no appreciable qualitative difference was observed .    to examine the generality of the @xmath5 scaling in high mobility graphene fets , we first measured both two probe and four probe noise in the bn - encapsulated graphene hall bar device , which exhibited room temperature ( four probe ) carrier mobilities of 58,000  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 and 35,000  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 in the electron doped and hole doped regimes , respectively",

    "2b and 2d .",
    "it is also interesting to note the drop in contact noise magnitude in the inhomogeneous regime , which could be due to the dominance of mcwhorter - type number fluctuation noise  @xcite , rather than just mobility fluctuations in the charge transfer region .",

    "3d ) , where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 are the metal - graphene interface resistance and graphene channel resistance , respectively . due to the inseparability of @xmath82 and @xmath81 within this contacting scheme , we plot @xmath57 as a function of @xmath16 in fig .",
    "it is evident that @xmath83 for @xmath84 , where @xmath81 is small due to heavy electrostatic doping of the channel .",
    "however , for @xmath85 , the deviation from the @xmath86 scaling is likely due to finite @xmath81 that causes @xmath16 to overestimate the true @xmath6 .",
    "we have observed an @xmath87 scaling of noise for high - mobility suspended graphene devices as well ( see fig .",
    "contact noise at the metal - semiconductor interface has been extensively researched over nearly seven decades  @xcite , and except for a few early models based on kinetics of interface disorder such as adsorbate atoms  @xcite , the most common mechanism is based on time - dependent fluctuations in the characteristics of the schottky barrier at metal - semiconductor junctions  @xcite .",
    "the linearity of @xmath88 characteristics ( not shown ) and temperature independence of @xmath6 ( see supplementary figure  4 ) in our devices however eliminate the possibility of schottky barrier - limited transport .",
    "an alternative source of time varying potential is the trapped charge at the sio@xmath7 surface  @xcite , which has been suggested to cause contact noise even in ballistic semiconducting carbon nanotubes fets  @xcite .",
    "the reaction of graphene with metals spontaneously leads to chemical modification ( _ e.g. _ carbide formation ) and introduction of defects ( see schematic in fig .",
    "the chemical modification and defect formation can strongly influence the band structure of graphene underneath the metal , suppressing the screening of coulomb impurities .",
    "this makes the charge transfer region susceptible to mobility fluctuations due to trapped charge fluctuations in sio@xmath7 , as indeed shown recently for noise at grain boundaries in graphene  @xcite .    to verify this",
    "we have fabricated an invasively cr / au contacted device where a single graphene channel was placed partially on bn ( thickness @xmath60  nm ) , thus physically separating the channel from the oxide traps  @xcite , whereas the other part was directly in contact with sio@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "the four probe transfer characteristics ( fig .",
    "4c ) confirms that the region of graphene placed on sio@xmath7 shows lower carrier mobility ( 7500  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 and 4000  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 for hole and electron doping respectively ) than the corresponding mobility ( 8000  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 and 7500  @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 ) of the part on bn , as well as strong substrate - induced doping , both of which can be readily understood by the proximity to charge traps at the sio@xmath7 surface . although @xmath57 in both parts show strong peaks at the respective dirac points ( fig .",
    "4d ) , it is evident that the normalized noise magnitude in the graphene on sio@xmath7 substrate is up to a factor of ten larger than that on bn , similar to that reported recently  @xcite .",
    "the scaling @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "4e ) over three decades of noise magnitude , irrespective of the substrate , unambiguously indicates the dominance of contact noise , and that the contact noise in graphene fets is primarily a result of mobility fluctuations in the charge transfer region due to fluctuating coulomb potential from local charge traps ( predominantly from the sio@xmath7 surface ) .",
    "finally , in order to outline a recipe to minimize the contact noise in graphene devices , we have compiled the normalised magnitude of specific contact noise @xmath89 as a function of specific contact resistance @xmath90 , from different classes of devices that were studied in this work .",
    "we identify two key factors that impact the contact noise : firstly , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "4f ( left ) , the specific contact noise is largest for graphene on sio@xmath7 , lower on devices with graphene on bn and lowest for suspended graphene devices where all sio@xmath7 has been etched away from under the graphene channel as well as partially from below the contact region ( see supplementary figure  5 ) .",
    "moreover , noise data from all devices with bn as substrate collapse on top of each other , regardless of mobility values , indicating that the separation of contacts from the sio@xmath7 traps is the primary factor that determines the noise magnitude rather than the channel quality itself .",
    "secondly , it can also be seen from fig .",
    "4f ( right ) , that the device with cr / au contacts , which are known to chemically modify graphene  @xcite , exhibits higher noise than the device with au contacts , which is expected to leave graphene intact , despite the fact that the former device has a bn substrate whereas the later sio@xmath7 .",
    "this highlights the major role of defects under metal contacts in noise generation .",
    "combining these factors leads to the conclusion that minimizing environmental electrostatic fluctuations and developing a contacting scheme that preserves the chemical / structural integrity of graphene , will be necessary for ultra - low noise graphene electronics .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied electrical noise at the metal contacts in graphene devices with a large range of carrier mobility , on multiple substrates with various device and lead geometries .",
    "using a phenomenological model of contact noise for purely two dimensional materials we show that contact noise is often the dominant noise source in graphene devices .",
    "the influence of contact noise is most severe in high - mobility graphene transistors .",
    "most surprisingly , we discover the ubiquity of contact noise which is seen to affect even four probe measurements in a hall bar geometry .",
    "our analysis suggests that contact noise is caused by strong mobility fluctuations in the charge transfer region under the metal contacts , due to the fluctuating electrostatic environment .",
    "a microscopic understanding of contact noise may aid in the development of ultra - low noise graphene electronics .",
