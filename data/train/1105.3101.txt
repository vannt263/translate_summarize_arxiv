    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) has been a central concept in theoretical physics in the last decades , with applications ranging from high - energy to condensed matter systems . however , since the seminal contributions by mermin , wagner and hohenberg@xcite , it has been clear that phase transitions ( pt ) @xcite in low dimensional systems can not in general be described in the context of ssb due to the lack of finite order parameters associated with the breaking of continuous symmetries such as , e.g , translational invariance . in one dimension ( 1d ) , gapless systems are usually characterized by _ dominant orders _ , embodied in the asymptotic algebraic decay of correlation functions which determine response functions ; such situation is usually referred to as quasi - long - range order ( qlro)@xcite , in contrast to true - long - range order associated with ssb .",
    "computing exact correlation functions remains a very challenging task even for exactly solvable models such as the xxz spin-@xmath0 chain @xcite , but the possibility to describe low - energy properties of 1d systems in terms of conformal field theories ( cft)@xcite has had a notable impact on the characterization of pts thanks in particular to the analogy between the compactified boson theory and tomonaga - luttinger liquids ( tll)@xcite described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath1.\\ ] ] here , @xmath2 is the sound velocity , @xmath3 are conjugated density and phase bosonic fields and @xmath4 is the tll parameter , related to the compactification radii @xmath5 of the fields via @xmath6@xcite .",
    "tlls have attracted increasing interest in recent times due to a large number of physical systems whose microscopic description is well approximated by eq .",
    "[ h_tll ] : signatures of tll physics has been predicted and observed in a series of setups ranging from typical condensed matter ones such as carbon nanotubes@xcite to highly tunable ultracold atomic gases@xcite .    in a tll , the asymptotic decay of correlation functions is entirely encoded in @xmath4 , which becomes the relevant quantity when determining qlro . for exactly solvable models , @xmath4 may be estimated through bethe ansatz ( ba)@xcite ; however , such a technique is not in general available , and one has to resort to perturbative or numerical methods .",
    "moreover , even thought simulation techniques for 1d systems have become extremely precise in recent years , reliable estimates of @xmath4 for complex systems such as multispecies hubbard - like models , describing bosonic and fermionic mixtures@xcite , and frustrated heisenberg chains @xcite are still challenging .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that qlro in 1d systems can be accurately determined from only ground state entanglement properties of a microscopic lattice model whose low - energy physics is encoded into the tll universality class by computing the so called rnyi entropies ( res ) ; in addition , we will show how pts between different dominant orders may be shaped by calculating res employing the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm@xcite .",

    "<S> we show how entanglement entropies allow for the estimation of quasi - long - range order in one dimensional systems whose low - energy physics is well captured by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid universality class . </S>",

    "<S> , we show how phase transitions between different dominant orders may be efficiently estimated by considering the superfluid - charge density wave transition in a system of dipolar bosons . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the application of this method to multispecies systems such as the one dimensional hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> our work represent the first proof of a direct relationship between the luttinger parameter and rnyi entropies in both bosonics and fermionic lattice models . </S>"
