    "according to a standard picture of the mixed state in bulk type - ii superconductors the abrikosov vortices penetrating the homogeneous sample form a periodic arrangement called a flux lattice @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux through the unit cell of such flux line lattice equals to the flux quantum @xmath1 : we have one vortex per unit cell .",
    "there are a few examples of rather exotic superconducting systems which may provide a possibility to observe a different vortex lattice periodicity , namely the structures with more than one vortices per unit cell .",
    "in particular , the phase transitions to such multiquanta flux lattices can occur , e.g. , for superconductors with unconventional pairing @xcite or 2d fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov superconductors @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to suggest an alternative scenario of the phase transitions between the flux structures with different number of vortices per unit cell which can be realized in thin films of anisotropic superconductors .",
    "the underlying physical mechanism for this scenario arises from the interplay between the long range attraction and repulsion between tilted vortex lines in thin films discussed recently in ref .  . the unusual attractive part of the vortex ",
    "vortex interaction potential is known to be a distinctive feature of anisotropic superconductors and the value of the attractive force is controlled by the tilting angle of the vortex line with respect to the anisotropy axis @xcite . the origin of the long range intervortex repulsion in thin films has been analyzed in the pioneering work @xcite by pearl in 1964 .",
    "this repulsion force always overcomes the attraction at rather large distances because of the different power decay laws of these contributions .",
    "note that , of course , the short range interaction between vortices is also repulsive .",
    "finally , this balance between the repulsion and attraction can result in the formation of the nonmonotonic interaction potential @xmath2 vs the intervortex distance @xmath3 .",
    "increasing the vortex tilting angle we first strengthen the attraction force between vortices and , thus , the minimum in the vortex interaction potential can appear only for rather large tilting angles when the attraction overcomes the pearl s repulsion .",
    "this minimum shifts towards the larger intervortex distances with the further increase in the tilting angle and , finally , at rather large distances the attraction appears to be suppressed due to the exponential screening effect . as a consequence ,",
    "the minimum in the interaction potential exists only for a certain restricted range of the vortex tilting angles which shrinks with the decrease of the system anisotropy parameter .",
    "the appearance of a minimum in the interaction potential points to the possibility to get a bound vortex pair ( or even the clusters with higher vorticities ) for a certain range of vortex tilting angles . for a flux line lattice",
    "such vortex ",
    "vortex interaction potential can cause an instability with respect to the unit cell doubling , i.e. the phase transition to the multiquanta vortex lattices .",
    "in this paper we use two theoretical approaches to describe the peculiarities of the intervortex interaction and resulting formation of clusters and multiquanta lattices .",
    "one of them is a standard london model accounting for an anisotropic mass tensor which is adequate for the superconductors with moderate anisotropy .",
    "this approach assumes that the superconducting coherence length in all directions exceeds the distance between the atomic layers and obviously breaks down in the limit of strong anisotropy , i.e. , for josephson  coupled layered structures . in the latter case",
    "we choose to apply another phenomenological model , namely the so  called lowrence ",
    "doniach theory @xcite . for rather small intervortex distances",
    "this theory can be simplified neglecting the effects of weak interlayer josephson coupling .",
    "this approach of josephson  decoupled superconducting layers is known to be useful in studies of the vortex ",
    "lattice structure at low fields @xcite .",
    "considering thin film samples in tilted magnetic fields we do not restrict ourselves by the case of only straight vortex lines and study the problem of the energetically favorable vortex line shape in the presence of the inhomogeneous supercurrent screening the field component @xmath4 parallel to the film plane .",
    "previously this problem has been addressed in ref .",
    "for rather small deviations of the vortex line from the direction normal to the film plane .",
    "such approximation is obviously valid only for the @xmath5 values much smaller than the critical field @xmath6 of the penetration of vortices parallel to the film plane . for anisotropic london model",
    "this analysis of ref .   has been previously generalized for the case of a strongly distorted vortex line ( see ref .  ) .",
    "for the sake of completeness we present here the calculations of the shape of an isolated vortex line for arbitrary fields @xmath7 within both theoretical models describing the limits of strong and moderate anisotropy . as a next step ,",
    "we calculate the vortex - vortex interaction potential for such strongly deformed vortex lines .",
    "further analysis in the paper includes the calculations of energy of finite size vortex clusters as well as the energy of vortex lattices with different number of vortices per unit cell .",
    "experimentally the visualization of unconventional vortex arrangements could be carried out by a number of methods which provided convincing evidence for the existence of vortex chains in bulk anisotropic superconductors caused by the intervortex attraction phenomenon ( such as the decoration technique in @xmath8 @xcite , scanning - tunneling microscopy in @xmath9 @xcite , scanning hall - probe @xcite and lorentz microscopy measurements in @xmath8 @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig:51 ] ) the minimum in the @xmath181 dependence appears for @xmath198 , whereas creation of the bound vortex pair becomes energetically favorable for @xmath199 . as a next step ,",

    "[ fig:6],[fig:7 ] .",
    "one can clearly see that the minimum in the interaction potential vs @xmath3 survives when we take account of the vortex line curvature .",
    "moreover the curving of the vortex line even deepens this minimum as it is confirmed by the comparison of energies of straight tilted and curved vortices presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] . for such comparison",
    "we choose the straight vortex lines connecting the ends of curved vortices .",
    "we find that for curved vortices the energy minimum exists even for smaller anisotropy parameters than for straight vortices ( i.e. , the threshold anisotropy value for @xmath194 becomes less than @xmath200 ) .",
    "of course , increasing the film thickness one can weaken the restrictions on the existence of the minimum in the interaction potential : e.g. , for @xmath201 the minimum appears at @xmath199 .",
    "the above theoretical analysis demonstrates that vortex  vortex attraction and the formation of chains are possible only for the rather large tilting angles and at low vortex concentrations , i.e. , when the magnetic - field component @xmath202 perpendicular to the film plane is very weak . in fields @xmath202 slightly above @xmath203 abrikosov vortices",

    "peculiarities of penetration of such chains of tilted abrikosov vortices into bulk layered ( anisotropic ) superconductor are well known : in the first approximation , the vortex period in chains does not depend on applied magnetic field , while the distance between chains changes as @xmath204 .",
    "the presence of vortex chains significantly modifies the magnetization curves with respect to analogous curves for isotropic superconductors .",

    "the unusual vortex - vortex interaction potential behavior discussed in the previous section can result in unconventional vortex structures .",
    "we start our analysis of energetically favorable vortex structures from the problem of stability of a vortex chain .",
    "the formation of infinite vortex chains is known to be a signature of the intervortex attraction in bulk anisotropic superconductors .",
    "the long range repulsion of vortices in thin films can destroy the infinite vortex chains . indeed , despite of the fact that two vortices attract each other at a certain distance , further increase in the number of vortices arranged in a chain can be energetically unfavorable because of the slower decay of the repulsive force compared to the attractive one . in this case , for rather thin samples",
    ", there appears an intriguing possibility to observe vortex chains of finite length , i.e. , vortex molecules or clusters . in this section",
    "we present the calculations of energies of such vortex clusters .    as we have demonstrated above , the minimum in the interaction potential exists for both the limits of strong and moderate anisotropy .",

    "[ fig:8 ] are schematic pictures of vortex matter consisting of dimeric and trimeric molecules .",
    "finally , for rather thick samples with @xmath209 we get a standard infinite chain structure typical for bulk systems .",
    "note that the formation of an infinite vortex chain may be considered in some sense as a polymerization of the vortex molecules .",
    "certainly , the crossover from the vortex molecule state to the infinite chain structure is strongly influenced by the increase in the vortex concentration governed by the component @xmath210 of the external magnetic field perpendicular to the film .",
    "indeed , one can expect such a cross - over to occur when the mean intervortex spacing approaches the molecule size .",
    "thus , the vortex molecule state can appear only in a rather weak perpendicular field when its observation can be complicated , of course , by the pinning effects .",
    "considering the effect of a finite magnetic field ( i.e. , a finite concentration of vortex clusters ) we restrict ourselves by the simplest case of regular vortex arrays . for a regular vortex array",
    "the formation of clusters corresponds to the transition with a change in the number of vortices in the elementary lattice cell .",
    "the mechanism underlying such transition is naturally connected with the appearance of the minimum in the interaction potential for a vortex pair . in this section",
    "we present our calculations of energy of vortex lattices with different number of flux quanta per unit cell .",

[ fig:10 ] ) . to exclude the divergence at @xmath234 it is convenient to deal with the energy difference : @xmath235 the results of our numerical calculations of this energy difference are shown in fig .",

    "<S> the distinctive features of equilibrium vortex structures in thin films of anisotropic superconductors in tilted magnetic fields are studied for the limits of moderate and strong anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the energetically favorable shape of isolated vortex lines is found in the framework of two particular models describing these limiting cases : london theory with an anisotropic mass tensor and london - type model for a stack of josephson  decoupled superconducting layers . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the field tilting is shown to result in qualitative changes in the vortex  </S>",
    "<S> vortex interaction potential : the balance between long  range attractive and repulsive forces occurs to be responsible for a formation of a minimum of the interaction potential vs the intervortex distance . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum appears to exist only for a certain restricted range of the vortex tilting angles which shrinks with the decrease of the system anisotropy parameter . tilted vortices with such unusual interaction potential form clusters with the size depending on the field tilting angle and film thickness or / and can arrange into multiquanta flux lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux through the unit cells of the corresponding flux line lattices equals to an integer number @xmath0 of flux quanta . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the increase in the field tilting should be accompanied by the series of the phase transitions between the vortex lattices with different @xmath0 . </S>"
