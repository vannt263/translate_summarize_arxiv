    "the discovery of topologically ordered phases over the past three decades has revolutionized our fundamental understanding of the quantum states of matter.@xcite for a long time , it was believed that different states can be fully classified by their patterns of symmetry breaking , and transitions between states of different symmetry can be described through the concept of local order parameters and the associated ginzburg - landau theory of symmetry - breaking .",
    "however , the discovery of the quantum hall effect showed that even when we break all symmetries of a system explictly , there can still be distinct quantum states of matter that can not be connected to each other without passing through a phase transition .",
    "these different states are distinguished not by symmetry - breaking order , but by a totally different kind of order , called topological order .",
    "understanding the topological phase of a system at equilibrium is , from one perspective , the coarsest and most basic question that can be asked of a quantum many - body system , because the result is independent of any particular symmetry of the problem . in this sense , almost all known conventional states of matter  superfluids , crystals , magnets , insulators , _ etc  are topologically trivial states : if all symmetries of the system are broken , most known systems would not have any phase transition as the system parameters are tuned . _    in order to have a fully developed theory of topological order , we need to understand how to characterize physically the possible topological states of quantum many - body systems , we need a mathematical framework that describes their properties , and we need to understand how to describe transitions between different topological states . while we know the mathematical framework  tensor category theory@xcite",
    " we do not completely know how to characterize them physically or how to describe their phase transitions .",
    "this is particularly true in the context of non - abelian topological phases .",
    "attempts to develop a systematic physical classification of non - abelian topological orders in fqh states has appeared recently in the context of the pattern of zeros and vertex algebra approaches to classifying ideal fqh wave functions.@xcite non - abelian states are currently the subject of major experimental and theoretical focus , largely because of the possibility of utilizing them for robust quantum information storage and processing.@xcite    this paper presents three main conceptual advances .",
    "first , we develop a theory of a set of continuous quantum phase transitions in bilayer quantum hall systems between well - known abelian states  the @xmath0 states@xcite  and a set of non - abelian topological phases that we call the orbifold fqh states .",
    "this generalizes the discovery in regarding transitions between the @xmath5 states and the non - abelian @xmath1 parafermion states .",
    "these are all transitions at the same filling fraction and can be driven by tuning interlayer tunneling and/or interlayer repulsion .",
    "these results are theoretically significant because aside from this series of transitions , there is only one other set of transitions involving non - abelian fqh states that is theoretically understood ; this is the transition between the @xmath6 bilayer states and the moore - read pfaffian states.@xcite the transitions presented here have experimental consequences : we see that there is a possibility of obtaining a wide array of possible non - abelian states in bilayer or wide quantum wells by starting with well - known states such as the @xmath7 state , and tuning the interlayer tunneling and/or interlayer repulsion .",
    "furthermore , the non - abelian states that we present here may also be relevant in explaining the single - layer plateaus seen in the second landau level , such as at @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the second major advance relates to the implications of the orbifold fqh states for the pattern of zeros / vertex algebra classification .",
    "currently , the pattern of zeros / vertex algebra approaches have a shortcoming : some patterns of zeros ( called `` sick '' pattern of zeros ) can not be used to uniquely fix the ground state and/or quasiparticle wave functions of fqh states .",
    "those `` sick '' patterns of zeros may correspond to gapless states for the ideal hamiltonian , leaving open the question of how such solutions may be relevant in describing gapped , incompressible phases .",
    "the orbifold fqh states that we study here are significant for the theoretical foundations of the pattern of zeros / vertex algebra approach because the orbifold states are closely related to such sick pattern of zeros solutions .",
    "while we use effective field theory and slave - particle gauge theory techniques to demonstrate the existence of these phases , the `` ideal wave functions '' associated with most of these orbifold fqh states correspond to the sick pattern of zeros solutions and are therefore gapless . in this paper",
    "we will discuss how to properly understand these sick pattern of zeros solutions and how they are actually relevant to describing gapped fqh states .",
    "finally , the study in this paper shows how non - abelian states can be obtained from a theory of @xmath2 fractionalization , in which the transitions can be viewed as the condensation of a @xmath2 charged field while the non - abelian excitations correspond to the @xmath2 vortices .",
    "this suggests possible generalizations to transitions between abelian and non - abelian states based on other discrete gauge groups .",
    "the results presented in this paper rely on a diverse , often complementary , array of techniques : chern - simons ( cs ) theory , slave - particle methods , conformal field theory , and vertex algebra .",
    "each technique by itself is not powerful enough , but the confluence of all them allows us to see the underlying structure and to establish our results .",
    "we will begin in section [ cstheorysec ] by briefly reviewing the results of an analysis of a particular topological field theory : the @xmath10 cs theory , which suggests the possible existence of a class of non - abelian fqh states  the orbifold states .",
    "however , the topological field theory alone does not imply that there is a possible fqh state of bosons or fermions with such topological properties . in section [ slavesect ]",
    ", we will develop a slave - particle gauge theory of @xmath2 fractionalization that shows that in principle there can be fqh states whose low energy effective field theories are the @xmath10 cs theories .",
    "this slave - particle construction will yield projected trial wave functions for the orbifold fqh states . in section [ edgesec ] , we study the edge theory of these orbifold fqh states and we develop a prescription for computing all topological quantum numbers of these phases .",
    "we present the results of this prescription in section [ qpcontent ] .    in section [ phasetransition ] , we study the phase transition between the bilayer abelian @xmath0 states and the orbifold states .",
    "we find that the transition is continuous and in the 3d ising universality class ; the critical theory is a @xmath2-gauged ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "these results give a physical manifestation of recent mathematical ideas of boson condensation in tensor category theory.@xcite    in section [ vertexalg ] we study the consequences of our results for the pattern of zeros / vertex algebra approaches to classifying fqh states .",
    "ideal wave functions are wave functions that can be obtained through correlation functions of vertex operators in a conformal field theory ; the naive ones for the orbifold fqh states are in general gapless and correspond to various sick pattern of zeros solutions .",
    "we discuss how to interpet this situation in the vertex algebra framework .",
    "the results show how the sick pattern of zeros / vertex algebra solutions should generally be viewed , and how they are relevant to describing gapped fqh states even when their associated ideal hamiltonians are gapless .    in section [ expsec ]",
    "we briefly discuss some experimental consequences of this work and we conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath10 cs theory was introduced in and many of its topological properties were explicitly calculated . here",
    "we give a brief review of the main results and pose the main questions that emerge .",
    "the lagrangian is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two @xmath14 gauge fields defined in 2 + 1 dimensions , @xmath15 , and there is an additional @xmath2 gauge symmetry associated with interchanging the two gauge fields .",
    "the semi - direct product @xmath16 highlights the fact that the @xmath2 transformation of interchanging the two @xmath14 gauge fields does not commute with the individual @xmath17 gauge transformations .    in the absence of the @xmath2 gauge symmetry , ( [ lagrangian ] ) is a @xmath17 cs theory and is the low energy effective field theory for a bilayer @xmath0 fqh state,@xcite where the currents in the two layers are given by : @xmath18 in the presence of the @xmath2 gauge symmetry and for @xmath19 , this theory describes a non - abelian topological phase where @xmath2 vortices are the fundamental non - abelian excitations .",
    "note that we use the same lagrangian for both the @xmath20 and the @xmath10 cs theories , even though they have different gauge structures and are therefore different topological theories .    when @xmath21 , all of the topological properties of the @xmath10 cs theory that we can compute agree precisely with those of the @xmath1 parafermion fqh states at filling fraction @xmath22 .",
    "this , in conjunction with a number of other results , led us to suggest that for @xmath21 , this is the correct effective field theory for the @xmath1 parafermion fqh states .",
    "this leads us to ask whether , for more general choices of @xmath23 , this theory also describes a valid , physically realistic , topological phase .",
    "in other words , does it describe a topological phase that can be realized , for some range of material parameters , in a physical system with realistic interactions ?",
    "it is not clear because , aside from @xmath24 , there are no known trial wave functions or trial hamiltonians that capture the properties of such a topological phase .",
    "in fact , the naive trial wave functions that are suggested from a projective construction analysis of these states are believed to be gapless for @xmath25 , which casts doubt on whether the phases described by the field theory are physical .",
    "a topological field theory by itself is not enough to know that it can be obtained from a physical system of interacting fermions or bosons . in this paper",
    "we will remedy this problem .    in order to develop the theory for the topological phases that are described by @xmath10 cs theory , in the following we will recall some of the topological properties of such a cs theory .",
    "the number of topologically distinct quasiparticles of the @xmath10 theory is given by the ground state degeneracy on a torus , which was calculated to be:@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "on genus @xmath28 surfaces , the number of degenerate ground states was calculated to be @xmath29.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using @xmath30 , we can read off an important set of topological quantum numbers of the phase : the quantum dimensions of all the quasiparticles .",
    "the quantum dimension @xmath31 of a quasiparticle of type @xmath32 has the following meaning . in the presence of @xmath33 quasiparticles of type @xmath32 at fixed locations ,",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space grows like @xmath34 .",
    "abelian quasiparticles have quantum dimension @xmath35 , while non - abelian quasiparticles have quantum dimension @xmath36 .",
    "the ground state degeneracy on genus @xmath28 surfaces is related to the quantum dimensions through the formula@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of quasiparticles , @xmath31 is the quantum dimension of the @xmath32th quasiparticle , and @xmath39 is the total quantum dimension . using ( [ genusgdeg ] ) and ( [ qddeg ] ) , we can calculate the quantum dimension @xmath31 for each quasiparticle by studying the @xmath40 limit .",
    "the results are as follows .",
    "the total quantum dimension is @xmath41 there are @xmath42 quasiparticles of quantum dimension 1 , @xmath42 quasiparticles of quantum dimension @xmath43 , and @xmath44 quasiparticles of quantum dimension 2 .",
    "the fundamental non - abelian excitations in the @xmath45 cs theory are @xmath2 vortices , which are topological defects around which the two gauge fields transform into each other .",
    "we can understand the fact that the @xmath2 vortices are non - abelian by seeing that there should be a degeneracy of states associated with a number of @xmath2 vortices at fixed locations . to see that there should be a degeneracy , see figure [ z2vorticesfig ] .",
    "the configurations of the two gauge fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 on a sphere with @xmath2 vortices can be re - interpreted as though there is a single gauge field on a doubled space with genus @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of pairs of @xmath2 vortices .",
    "how to see that @xmath2 vortices at fixed locations come with a degeneracy of states and should therefore be non - abelian . in ( a )",
    "we deform the space arbitrarily , and in ( b ) we consider a doubled - space with genus @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of pairs of @xmath2 vortices . because of the boundary conditions of the two gauge fields @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    ", we can define a single continuous gauge field on the doubled space , which leaves us with @xmath14 cs theory on a genus @xmath46 surface .",
    "thus the number of states in the presence of @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices grows exponentially in @xmath47 . in this sense ,",
    "@xmath2 vortices are like `` genons : '' they effectively change the genus of the manifold . ]    in , we studied the number of degenerate ground states in the presence of @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices at fixed locations on a sphere .",
    "the result for the number of such states is : @xmath48 this shows that the quantum dimension of the @xmath2 vortices is @xmath49 .",
    "we can also compute the number of states that are odd under the @xmath2 gauge transformation .",
    "the number of these @xmath2 non - invariant states also turns out to be an important quantity , because it yields important information about the fusion rules of the quasiparticles .",
    "the number of @xmath2 non - invariant states yields the number of ways for @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices to fuse to an abelian quasiparticle that carries @xmath2 gauge charge .",
    "the ground state degeneracy of @xmath2 non - invariant states in the presence of @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices at fixed locations on a sphere was computed to be @xmath50 thus if @xmath51 labels a @xmath2 vortex , these calculations reveal the following fusion rules for @xmath51 and its conjugate @xmath52 : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a topologically non - trivial excitation that carries the @xmath2 gauge charge .",
    "the @xmath55 represent additional quasiparticles that may appear in the fusion .    in what follows ,",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath56 , because these are the cases that are relevant for the bilayer @xmath0 states .",
    "the @xmath10 cs theory presented above defines a topological field theory , however for @xmath57 it is unclear whether it can arise as the low energy effective field theory of a physical system with local interactions . in this section ,",
    "we show how the @xmath10 cs theory can arise from a slave - particle formulation , which adds strong evidence to the possibility of these states being realized in physical systems with local interactions .",
    "the slave - particle formulation provides us with candidate many - body wave functions that capture the topological properties of these phases .",
    "it also provides a uv - completion , or lattice regularization , of the @xmath10 cs theory .",
    "this is useful for computing certain topological properties , such as the electric charge of the @xmath2 vortices , which we were unable to calculate directly from the @xmath10 cs theory alone .",
    "finally , this slave - particle formulation provides us with an example in which @xmath2 electron fractionalization may lead to non - abelian topological phases .",
    "consider a bilayer quantum hall system , and suppose that the electrons move on a lattice .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the electron annihilation operator at site @xmath32 ; @xmath59 , @xmath60 refers to the two layers .",
    "now consider the positive and negative combinations : @xmath61    we will use a slave - particle decomposition to rewrite @xmath62 in terms of new bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom , including appropriate constraints so as not to unphysically enlarge the hilbert space .",
    "such slave - particle decompositions allow us to access novel fractionalized phases . in the following section",
    ", we will introduce a slave ising construction that interpolates between the bilayer abelian @xmath0 states and the states described by the @xmath63 cs theory . in appendix [ slaverotorapp ] , we will introduce a slave rotor construction , which can describe these two phases with the advantage of including a larger set of fluctuations about the slave - particle mean - field states .",
    "we introduce two new fields at each lattice site @xmath32 : an ising field @xmath64 and a fermionic field @xmath65 , and we rewrite @xmath66 as @xmath67 this introduces a local @xmath2 gauge symmetry , associated with the transformations @xmath68 the electron operators are neutral under this @xmath2 gauge symmetry , and therefore the physical hilbert space at each site is the gauge - invariant set of states at each site : @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is the state with @xmath72 , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the physical states at each site are those which satisfy @xmath73    if we imagine that the fermions @xmath74 form some gapped state , then we would generally expect two distinct phases:@xcite the deconfined/@xmath2 unbroken phase , where @xmath75 and the confined / higgs phase , where upon fixing a gauge we have @xmath76 we seek a mean - field theory where the deconfined phase corresponds to the orbifold fqh states , and the confined / higgs phase corresponds to the bilayer @xmath0 states . to do this , observe that in the higgs phase , we have @xmath77 since we may set @xmath78 in this phase .",
    "in such a situation , we can use the parton construction@xcite to obtain the @xmath0 states .",
    "for example , to obtain the @xmath7 states , we rewrite the electron operators in each layer in terms of three partons : @xmath79 where @xmath80 carries electric charge @xmath81 .",
    "we can then rewrite the theory in terms of the original electrons in terms of a theory of these partons , with the added constraint that @xmath82 where @xmath83 , in order to preserve the electron anti - commutation relations and to avoid unphysically enlarging the hilbert space at each site .",
    "the @xmath7 state corresponds to the case where each parton forms a @xmath84 integer quantum hall state .",
    "therefore , to interpolate between the @xmath1 parafermion state and the @xmath7 state at @xmath85 , we write : @xmath86 more generally , to describe the @xmath0 states and the orbifold fqh states , we set @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( note that we assume @xmath89 ) . furthermore",
    ", we assume that the interactions are such that the partons each form a @xmath84 iqh state .",
    "in what follows , let us focus on the case @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath91 , we can write @xmath92 the low energy theory will thus be a theory of @xmath93 partons , each with electric charge @xmath94 , and coupled to a @xmath95 gauge field : @xmath96 where @xmath12 is an @xmath95 gauge field , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the external electromagnetic gauge field , and @xmath100 .",
    "if the partons form a @xmath84 iqh state , then we can integrate out the partons to obtain a @xmath101 cs theory as the long - wavelength , low energy field theory .",
    "this @xmath101 cs theory reproduces all of the correct ground state properties , such as the ground state degeneracy on genus @xmath28 surfaces , and the fusion rules of the quasiparticles .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations are related to holes in the parton integer quantum hall states .",
    "the @xmath101 cs theory needs to be supplemented with additional information about the fermionic character of an odd number of holes in order to completely capture all of the topological quantum numbers .",
    "this can be done by using the @xmath102 cs theory instead , which is known to be the correct low - energy effective field theory of the bilayer @xmath103 states .",
    "now consider the @xmath2 deconfined phase , where @xmath104 ; what is the low energy effective theory ?",
    "since the partons still each form a @xmath84 iqh state and are coupled to an @xmath95 gauge field , integrating them out will yield a @xmath101 cs theory , and using the arguments outlined above , we are left with a @xmath102 cs theory .",
    "suppose that we also sum over the ising spins @xmath105 .",
    "since there are no gapless modes associated with phases of the ising spins , we expect a local action involving the @xmath2 gauge field coupled to the @xmath14 gauge fields .",
    "we do not know how to explicitly write this action down , because the cs terms are difficult to properly define on a lattice , while the discrete gauge fields require a lattice for their action .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the theory on general grounds : observe that the @xmath2 gauge symmetry interchanges @xmath80 and @xmath106 ; thus in the low energy theory involving only the gauge fields , the @xmath2 gauge symmetry interchanges the current densities associated with the two @xmath14 gauge fields .",
    "this is precisely the content of the @xmath10 cs theory .",
    "thus , we may think of the @xmath2 deconfined phase of this slave ising construction as providing a uv - completion of the @xmath10 cs theory . in a sense",
    ", we can even think of this slave particle gauge theory as the complete definition of the @xmath10 cs theory .",
    "now let us further study the low energy excitations of this @xmath2 fractionalized phase . in this phase",
    ", the ising spin @xmath107 can propagate freely and is deconfined from the partons .",
    "this is an electrically neutral excitation that is charged under the @xmath2 gauge symmetry and that fuses with itself to the identity .",
    "the phases described by the @xmath10 cs theory all have precisely such a @xmath2 charged excitation ; ( [ z2noninv ] ) and ( [ z2vortexfusion ] ) yield the number of ways for @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices to fuse to precisely this @xmath2 charged excitation , which was denoted @xmath54 .",
    "the other novel topologically non - trivial excitation in the @xmath2 deconfined phase is the @xmath2 vortex . since the @xmath2 gauge field",
    "is coupled to the partons , the @xmath2 vortex is non - abelian .",
    "this is not an obvious result : in the low - energy @xmath10 cs theory the @xmath2 vortex corresponds to a topological defect around which the two @xmath14 gauge fields transform into each other .",
    "a detailed study of the @xmath2 vortices in the @xmath10 theory shows that there is a topological degeneracy associated with the presence of @xmath47 pairs of @xmath2 vortices at fixed locations , which reveals that the @xmath2 vortices are non - abelian quasiparticles ( see figure [ z2vorticesfig ] ) .",
    "can we understand the allowed values of the electric charge carried by the @xmath2 vortices ?",
    "we believe the @xmath10 cs theory , for certain choice of coupling constants , describes the @xmath1 parafermion state .",
    "the @xmath1 parafermion state has a fundamental non - abelian excitation that carries a fractionalized electric charge ; at @xmath85 for example , the electric charge of the fundamental non - abelian excitation comes in odd multiples of @xmath108 . since we believe that the @xmath2 vortices in this theory correspond to the fundamental non - abelian excitations , an important check on this slave ising description will be whether it can account for these values of the fractionalized electric charge . to calculate the electric charge ,",
    "let us define the following parton operators , which are superpositions of the parton operators @xmath80 : @xmath109 the local @xmath2 gauge symmetry corresponds to the transformation : @xmath110 thus , @xmath111 is @xmath2-neutral while @xmath112 is @xmath2-charged .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath80 each form a @xmath84 iqh state , then @xmath111 and @xmath112 also each form @xmath84 iqh states .",
    "the particle / hole excitations of the states formed by @xmath112 carry electric charge @xmath94 ( recall we set @xmath90 in ( [ slaveising ] ) ) .",
    "the @xmath2 vortex acts as a @xmath113-flux for @xmath112 .",
    "thus in the low - energy field theory , the interaction between the excitations of the @xmath112 iqh state and the external electromagnetic gauge field @xmath114 and the @xmath2 vortices is described by @xmath115 where a @xmath2 vortex is associated with @xmath113 flux of the @xmath14 gauge field @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 is the current density associated with the @xmath112 partons .",
    "integrating out the partons , which are in a @xmath84 iqh state , will generate a chern - simons term : @xmath118 notice that the interaction between the @xmath111 current and the external electromagnetic gauge field will contribute another term @xmath119 to the action , from which we see that the filling fraction is @xmath120 .",
    "furthermore , because of the coupling of @xmath121 to the external gauge field @xmath99 , we see that a @xmath113 flux of the @xmath116 gauge field will carry charge @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , depending on how many holes , @xmath33 , of the parton integer quantum hall states are attached to the @xmath2 vortices , the @xmath2 vortices can have electric charge of @xmath123 when @xmath124 , this result agrees exactly with properties of the @xmath1 parafermion state , which is that the electric charge of the fundamental non - abelian quasiparticles comes in odd multiples of @xmath108 .",
    "more generally , when @xmath125 is odd ( even ) , we see that the @xmath2 vortices can only carry electric charge in odd ( even ) integer multiples of @xmath126 . in section [ genqpprop ] , we will again see precisely these results through a totally different description of this phase !",
    "the slave - particle approach naturally suggests trial wave functions that capture the essential long - wavelength properties of the phase .",
    "first we have the mean - field state of the partons and the ising spins : latexmath:[\\ ] ] the trace is over states in the module labelled @xmath167 $ ] , where @xmath168 is a primary field of the chiral algebra . for fqh states , the @xmath168 label different quasiparticle sectors .",
    "@xmath169 is the generator of scale transformations , @xmath170 , and @xmath171 is the central charge .",
    "the scaling dimensions and fusion rules of the primary fields can be obtained by studying the transformation rules of the characters under the modular transformations @xmath172 and @xmath173.@xcite    using the chiral characters , we would also be able to obtain the full edge spectrum for the fqh states on a disk .",
    "the spectrum of edge states at each angular momentum in the topological sector labelled by @xmath168 are given by the coefficients @xmath174 in the expansion @xmath175 here , @xmath174 is the number of edge excitations with energy @xmath176 on a disk with the quasiparticle created by @xmath168 at the center of the disk .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining the characters is a highly non - trivial task . in known examples of orbifold cfts ,",
    "one common way to proceed is to first compute the torus partition function of the non - chiral theory , which includes both holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors of the cft .",
    "the partition function is related to the chiral characters through @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a matrix that specifies how to glue together the holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors .",
    "sometimes it is possible to take the `` holomorphic square root '' and guess the chiral characters @xmath179 from the partition function @xmath180 .",
    "this is done , for example , for the @xmath181 orbifold cfts at @xmath182.@xcite in the case of fqh states , @xmath180 may be used to compute the edge spectrum on a cylinder by expanding in powers of @xmath183 and @xmath184 .    in the case of the @xmath153/z_2 $ ] orbifold cft",
    ", it is possible to compute @xmath180 , but we do not know at present how to take the holomorphic square root and thus derive the scaling dimensions and fusion rules of the operators in the edge theory . in spite of this shortcoming , we can develop a prescription for computing the scaling dimensions and fusion rules of the operators in this cft .",
    "we will perform many highly non - trivial checks with both the slave particle gauge theory and with results of the @xmath10 cs theory in order to confirm that the prescription given yields correct results .",
    "this prescription is necessary because it is currently the only way we have of computing all of the topological quantum numbers of the orbifold states . while the slave ising and associated @xmath10 cs theory descriptions are powerful and can be used to calculate many highly non - trivial topological properties , we do not currently know how to use them to compute all topological properties of the orbifold states , such as the spin of the @xmath2 vortices or the full set of fusion rules .",
    "first observe that if we consider the following combination of the chiral scalar fields : @xmath185 then the action becomes equivalent to the action of a free chiral scalar field , @xmath186 , and that of the @xmath181 orbifold , described by @xmath187 .",
    "however , the edge theory is not simply a direct product of these two independent theories .",
    "the reason is that the fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 are compactified : in the case @xmath90 , we have @xmath188 the compactification radius @xmath189 is related to @xmath125 through @xmath190 .",

    "we currently do not know whether for @xmath257 there are also non - abelian analogs that are separated from a bilayer abelian phase by a @xmath243 transition .",
    "we also do not know whether there is a way to describe these states in terms of a cs theory with a gauge group that makes the @xmath243 structure explicit , as there is for @xmath258 .",
    "while the slave ising construction presented above is sufficient to describe the bilayer abelian @xmath0 states and the non - abelian orbifold fqh states , it is a `` minimal '' slave - particle gauge theory in the sense that it only captures the minimal amount of fluctuations about a given mean - field state in order to see the possibility of the two phases .",
    "it is possible to improve the slave - particle description by including more of these fluctuations about the mean - field states and probing a larger part of the hilbert space .",
    "this can be done by promoting the above slave ising theory to the following slave rotor description .",
    "we rewrite the electron operators in the following way : @xmath259 in such a construction , we have a @xmath14 gauge symmetry associated with the following local transformations : @xmath260 this means that the physical states must satisfy @xmath261 for any @xmath262 ( there is an arbitrary @xmath14 phase factor that we have set to unity here ) .",

    "for example , for @xmath90 , we decompose @xmath266 as @xmath267 in this case , the gauge symmetry associated with translating @xmath264 is actually only a @xmath2 symmetry : @xmath268 in this case , the constraint on the rotor is actually @xmath269 even . or , alternatively : @xmath270        note that the above hamiltonian does not preserve a global @xmath14 symmetry associated with arbitrary translations of @xmath264 ; there is only a @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "thus there are only two distinct phases .",
    "the first one is smoothly connected to a situation in which @xmath273 and the second one is smoothly connected to a situation in which @xmath274 the first possibility breaks the @xmath2 gauge symmetry , while the second one preserves it .",
    "these two possibilities describe precisely the same two phases as the slave ising theory described above . in the first case ,",
    "suppose we set @xmath275 .",
    "then , we are left with the parton construction for the @xmath0 states . in the @xmath2 unbroken phase",
    ", we may set @xmath276 , so that @xmath277 .",
    "thus , these two phases that we can access in the slave rotor approach are the same phases that we can access from the slave ising approach .",
    "the @xmath2 broken phase corresponds to the bilayer @xmath0 states , while the @xmath2 unbroken phase corresponds to the orbifold fqh states .",
    "the slave rotor approach has the advantage of probing more fluctuations around the mean - field states because more of the hilbert space is being accessed in this decomposition .",
    "this may allow for more reliable calculations of the phase diagram .",
