    "b one finds a proof of the fact that the motion planning algorithm has no singularities .",
    "the dynamics   reads in quaternion notation ( see appendix a ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a quaternion of length one and where @xmath40 is the control relative to the modulation of a coherent laser field ( @xmath41 is the complex field amplitude ) .",
    "this system is a driftless system on the lie group @xmath42 .",
    "it is controllable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , this control system is invariant with respect to right translations in the sense of  @xcite :    * the group @xmath43 acts on the state space @xmath44 via right multiplication @xmath45 where @xmath39 . *",
    "the dynamics is @xmath46-invariant : if @xmath47 is a solution of   then @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 is also a solution of   for any @xmath51 .",
    "the controllability structure of this system is in fact of a very special kind . around any point @xmath52 , can be seen in local coordinates as a driftless controllable system with @xmath53 states that maps a neighborhood of @xmath54 to a neighborhood of @xmath55 in @xmath42 . ] and 2 controls .",
    "thus , as known since  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , such system is differentially flat and the flat output function can be chosen to depend only on the state .",
    "more precisely , the flat output for the controllable system @xmath56 with @xmath57 is obtained by the rectifying coordinates of any vector field @xmath58 which is a linear combination of the two control vector fields @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 are any scalar functions of @xmath63 ) .",
    "we propose here a coordinate free and symmetry preserving construction of the flat output via the previous procedure .",

    "the following construction will be based on the control vector field associated to @xmath27 , and hence to @xmath70 .",

    "we can consider the action of @xmath72 on @xmath42 via left multiplication : to any @xmath73 , we have the diffeomorphism @xmath74 .",
    "two elements of @xmath42 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , belong to the same orbit if and only if there exists @xmath73 such that @xmath77 . denote by @xmath65 the set of the orbits .",
    "this set is a compact manifold of dimension 2 and the output function @xmath67 is the map that associates to any @xmath75 , the orbit @xmath78 to which @xmath75 belongs .",
    "this map is a smooth submersion , and @xmath65 is called an homogenous space ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . if @xmath75 and @xmath76 belong to the same orbit , @xmath79 and @xmath80 also belong to the same orbit for any @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , this output map is @xmath46-compatible in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "assume that @xmath82 is a curve on @xmath83 , at least of class @xmath84 . since the map @xmath85 is a submersion , in adequate local coordinates one has @xmath86 .",

    "let us show now that the map @xmath67 defines a flat output .",

    "thus we have to consider the following implicit system @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a known function of time and where the quaternion @xmath107 and the control @xmath108 are the unknown quantities .",
    "the problem is how to manipulate @xmath67 , since only a geometric construction for @xmath67 is available . knowing the function @xmath109 means that we have at our disposal a smooth function @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "hence , to have @xmath112 means that @xmath75 and @xmath113 belongs to the same orbit for each time @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , there exists @xmath114 in @xmath72 such that @xmath115 . since @xmath116",
    ", then @xmath117 is smooth .",
    "thus , we have @xmath118 but @xmath119 where @xmath120 . using  ,",
    "we get the following equation @xmath121 , that is @xmath122 this quaternion equation gives in fact @xmath123 as a function of @xmath124 .",
    "left and right multiplication by @xmath125 yields @xmath126 since @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "hence , we have the following relation ( without the controls and @xmath129 ) : @xmath130 assume that @xmath131 where the @xmath132 s are known smooth real functions of time .",
    "thus , we get @xmath133 since @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 for @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , reads : @xmath138 since @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "right multiplication by @xmath141 yields the following algebraic equation defining  @xmath123 @xmath142 since @xmath143 , we have the following equation for the angle @xmath144 @xmath145 which is equivalent to @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a known complex number .",
    "thus , there are four distinct possibilities for @xmath123 : @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the argument of @xmath150 . the controls @xmath27 and @xmath31 associated to one of these four trajectories are obtained by @xmath151 where @xmath152 is given via simple algebraic formulae based on @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 : @xmath157 for the two branches @xmath158 we get @xmath159 and for the two other ones @xmath160 we get @xmath161 where just the sign of @xmath31 is changed .",
    "all the previous computations are valid when @xmath162 , i.e. , when @xmath163 : @xmath164 does not depends on @xmath165 such that @xmath166 ; it depends only on @xmath82 and vanishes if , and only if , @xmath167 .",
    "to summarize , we have proved the following result :    [ flat : thm ] take @xmath10 and an arbitrary @xmath84 curve @xmath13\\ni t\\mapsto y(t)$ ] on @xmath65 such that @xmath168 for any @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "for any smooth curve @xmath170 such that @xmath166 , set @xmath171 for all @xmath169 $ ] where @xmath172 . then there exists a smooth function @xmath13\\ni t\\mapsto \\theta(t)\\in{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] such that @xmath173 and any smooth solution @xmath174 of   satisfying @xmath175 for all @xmath169 $ ] is one of the four following trajectories indexed by @xmath176 : @xmath177    recall that some @xmath165 such that @xmath111 is locally given by @xmath178 , and furthermore @xmath179 and @xmath180 , where @xmath92 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are smooth maps . in particular , the last theorem proves that @xmath99 is a flat output .",
    "the flat output @xmath99 is obtained with @xmath70 playing a specific role . in fact one can see that any map @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) corresponding to the subgroup @xmath183 also defines a flat output .",
    "it just corresponds to a rotation by the angle @xmath184 of @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "if we set @xmath187 the imaginary quaternions @xmath188 and @xmath189 satisfy exactly the same commutation relations .",
    "thus , if @xmath190 is a solution of   with the control @xmath108 then @xmath191 is also a solution of   with the control @xmath192 this symmetry and the fact that , as stated in theorem  [ flat : thm ] , @xmath193 is a flat output , implies directly that @xmath194 is also a flat - output . the family @xmath195 is made of flat outputs all compatible versus right translations .",
    "in this section , we will use   with @xmath196 to propose an explicit solution for the motion planning problem stated in the introduction : for any @xmath10 and any final state @xmath197 , find a smooth control @xmath13\\ni t \\mapsto u(t)=(u_1(t),u_2(t))\\in{{\\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] with @xmath14 , such that the solution @xmath13\\ni t \\mapsto q(t)\\in{{\\mathbb h}}_1 $ ] of   starting from @xmath198 reaches @xmath55 at time @xmath17 : i.e. , @xmath199 .",
    "as the system is driftless , every time re - parameterization of a solution is also a solution .",
    "in fact , consider the equation @xmath200 let @xmath201 \\rightarrow [ 0 , 1]$ ] be an increasing diffeomorphism .",
    "then @xmath202 is a solution of the previous equation defined on @xmath203 $ ] , with input @xmath204 if and only if @xmath205 is a solution of ( [ dyn : eq ] ) defined on @xmath206 $ ] with input @xmath207 .",
    "one concludes that , without loss of generality , one may always state the motion planning problem with the ( virtual ) time @xmath208 belonging to the interval @xmath209 $ ] and after that , one may `` control the clock '' by choosing a convenient bijection @xmath210 .",
    "thus , it is enough to solve the motion planning problem in the @xmath208 scale where we can disregard the fact that the control has to vanish at the beginning and at the end : it is enough to take for example @xmath211 to get @xmath6 equal to zero at @xmath212 and at @xmath213 , since @xmath214 .    in the sequel",
    "we propose a solution in the @xmath208-scale . for clarity s sake , we will remove the @xmath215 when @xmath6 and @xmath75 are considered as function of @xmath208 .",
    "the derivation in @xmath208 will be denoted by @xmath216 : @xmath217 , @xmath218 , ",
    "thus , we have to find a smooth control @xmath209\\ni s \\mapsto u(s)$ ] such that the solution of @xmath219 satisfies @xmath220 , where @xmath55 is any goal state in @xmath42 .",
    "we can always assume that @xmath221 for some angle @xmath222 $ ] .",
    "thus , as explained at the end of last section , up to a rotation of angle @xmath223 of the control , we can assume that @xmath224 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath225 , set @xmath223 to be the argument of the complex @xmath226 .",
    "if @xmath227 steers @xmath75 from @xmath228 to @xmath229 , then the control @xmath230 steers @xmath75 from @xmath228 to @xmath220 .",
    "thus up - to a rotation of angle @xmath223 of the control , we can assume that @xmath224 and @xmath231 .",
    "thus we can define two angles @xmath2320,\\pi]$ ] and @xmath233 $ ] such that @xmath234 if the control @xmath235 steers the system from @xmath228 to @xmath236 , the same control steers the system from @xmath237 to @xmath238 this is a direct consequence of right translation invariance of   and right multiplication by @xmath239 .",
    "take now the formulae   in the @xmath208-scale with @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 are smooth functions such that @xmath243 set , as in theorem  [ flat : thm ] @xmath244 simple computations shows that @xmath245    now we shall construct such that @xmath246 $ ] is a trajectory of the system .",
    "we will assume that @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "so we must have @xmath249 .",
    "furthermore , if we can ensure that @xmath250 never vanishes , and @xmath251 , then the trajectory of   with @xmath196 will provide a steering control @xmath6 .",
    "let us now show in detail how to design the functions @xmath241 and @xmath242 satisfying these constraints .",
    "first of all we have the initial and final constraints  . by taking @xmath252 $ ; } \\\\               \\frac{\\pi}{4 } - \\frac{\\bar\\alpha}{2 } , & \\hbox{otherwise ; }             \\end{array }           \\right.\\ ] ] we always have @xmath253 far from @xmath254 when @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "thus we can impose the following initial and final constraints for @xmath257 : @xmath258 and for @xmath259 @xmath260 then @xmath241 and @xmath242 are the polynomials of degree @xmath261 satisfying these initial and final constraints . since @xmath262 and @xmath263 , @xmath264 can be a strictly increasing function on @xmath209 $ ] and @xmath265 for @xmath2660,1[$ ] ( see appendix b ) .",
    "thus the complex number @xmath267 never vanishes for @xmath2660,1[$ ] . for @xmath255 and @xmath256",
    ", we have @xmath268 thus @xmath269 . to summarize the closed path @xmath209\\ni s\\mapsto z(s)\\in{{\\mathbb c}}$ ] never passes through @xmath254 nor turns around @xmath254 .",
    "we satisfy the assumption of theorem  [ flat : thm ] in the @xmath208-scale",
    ". moreover we can set @xmath270 with @xmath271 and @xmath272 smooth functions on @xmath209 $ ] with @xmath251 .",
    "we avoid with such design of @xmath241 and @xmath242 the monodromy problem associated to the resolution of @xmath273 .",
    "finally we have proved the following result .",
    "[ steer : thm ] take @xmath274 with @xmath275 .",
    "chose @xmath276 such that @xmath277 .",

    "define @xmath241 and @xmath283 as being the unique polynomial functions of degree @xmath261 such that ( @xmath216 stands for @xmath284 ) @xmath285 define @xmath286 , @xmath287 and @xmath288 by @xmath289 then @xmath153 and @xmath154 never vanish simultaneously and the control @xmath290 steers system   @xmath228 to @xmath199 with @xmath291 $ ] being a @xmath292 increasing bijection between @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath209 $ ] @xmath293 .",
    "when in addition @xmath294 for @xmath255 and @xmath256 , and @xmath295 , the control @xmath296 is @xmath297 with @xmath298 for @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "figure  [ steer : fig ] illustrates the steering control described by theorem  [ steer : thm ] with @xmath299 , @xmath300 , and @xmath301 .",
    "we see that the control is a smooth function with maxima around @xmath302 , a value close to the @xmath303 design based on two successive pulses : @xmath304 for @xmath305 $ ] and @xmath306 for @xmath307 $ ] .",
    "thus our flatness based design yields , with the same transition time and control magnitude , smooth control actions .     with @xmath299 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "the control magnitude is very close to an @xmath303 control design with two separated @xmath310 pulses .",
