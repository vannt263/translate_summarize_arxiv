    "a more comprehensive description of critical slowdown see  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that to demonstrate the above phenomenon in full , one needs to derive precise estimates on the mixing time up to the critical temperature , which can be quite challenging .    perhaps the most studied model in this context",
    "is ising . for the complete graph ,",
    "a comprehensive treatment is given in @xcite , where critical slowdown ( as described above ) around the uniqueness threshold @xmath102 is established in full .",
    "in this setting , finer statements about the asymptotics of the mixing time can be made .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite the case where @xmath87 approaches @xmath102 with the size of the system is analyzed ( in theorem  [ thm : nearcriticalmixing ] here we consider this case as well ) . the same picture , yet with the notable exclusion of a cutoff proof at high temperatures , is also known on the @xmath103-regular tree where  @xcite established the high and low temperature regimes and recently  @xcite proved polynomial mixing at criticality .    from a mathematical physics point of view , the most interesting underlying graph to consider is the lattice @xmath104 .",
    "for @xmath105 the full critical slowdown is now known : for a box with @xmath5 vertices the mixing time is @xmath106 throughout the high temperature regime  @xcite whereas it is @xmath107 throughout the low temperature regime  @xcite with @xmath108 being the surface tension .",
    "the @xmath105 picture was very recently completed by two of the authors establishing cutoff in the high temperature regime  @xcite and polynomial mixing at the critical temperature  @xcite . for a more comprehensive survey of recent literature for ising on the lattice",
    "see  @xcite .    turning back to the potts model , understanding the kinetic picture here is of interest , not just as an extension of the results for ising , but as an example of a model with a first order phase transition .",
    "unlike in ising , the free energy in the potts model on various graphs and values of @xmath21 undergoes a first order phase transition as the temperature is varied .",
    "this is certainly true for all @xmath109 in the mean - field approximation , i.e.  on the complete graph as treated here , but also known to be the case on @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for some @xmath113 @xcite ( although most values of @xmath114 are not known rigorously , it was shown that @xmath115  @xcite and @xmath116 for all @xmath103 large enough @xcite ) .",
    "a first order phase transition has direct implications on the dynamics of the system .",
    "for one , the coexistence of phases at criticality , implies slow mixing . this is because getting from one phase to another requires passing through a large free energy barrier , i.e.  states which are exponentially unlikely .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the mixing time for potts on a box with @xmath5 vertices in @xmath110 for any fixed @xmath111 and sufficiently large @xmath21 is shown to be exponential in the surface area of the box for any @xmath87 larger or ( notably ) equal to the uniqueness threshold @xmath117 .",
    "this should be compared with the aforementioned polynomial mixing of glauber dynamics for ising at criticality . in fact , coexistence of the ordered and disordered phases also accounts for the slow mixing of the swendsen - wang dynamics at the critical temperature .",
    "this is shown in @xcite for @xmath110 under a similar range of @xmath103 and @xmath21 and in  @xcite for the complete graph .",
    "other dynamics also exhibit slow mixing at criticality @xcite .",
    "first order phase transitions are expected to lead to metastability type phenomena on the lattice in some instances .",
    "there has been extensive work on this topic ( see  @xcite and the references therein ) yet the picture remains incomplete .",
    "it is expected that the transition to equilibrium will be carried through a nucleation process , which has an @xmath118 lifetime and therefore does not affect the order of the mixing time in contrast to the mean - field case .",
    "this is affirmed , for instance , in ising where @xmath106 mixing time is known for low enough temperatures under an ( arbitrarily small ) non - zero external field , despite the first order phase transition ( in the field ) around @xmath38 . for related works",
    "see e.g.  @xcite as well as  @xcite and the references there .",
    "similarly , the potts model on the lattice should feature rapid mixing of @xmath49 throughout the sub - critical regime @xmath119 due to the vanishing surface - area - to - volume ratio .",
    "thus , contrary to the critical slowdown picture predicted for ising , whenever there is a first order phase transition it should be accompanied by a sharp transition from fast mixing at @xmath120 to an exponentially slow mixing at @xmath102 in lieu of a critical power law .",
    "however , fast mixing of the potts model on @xmath104 for @xmath121 is not rigorously known except at very high temperatures ( where it follows from standard arguments  @xcite ) . for sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "cutoff was very recently shown in  @xcite .",
    "on the complete graph however , metastability is apparent . in the absence of geometry",
    ", the order parameter sufficiently characterizes the state of the system and thus the dynamics and its stationary distribution are described effectively by the free energy of the system as a function of the order parameter . while coexistence of phases implies that at criticality the free energy is minimized at more than one value of the order parameter ( corresponding to each phase ) , continuity entails that some of these global minima will turn into local minima just below or above criticality .",
    "these local minimizers correspond exactly to the metastable states and the value ( or curve ) of the thermodynamic parameter ( e.g. temperature ) beyond which these local minima cease to appear is called _",
    "spinodal_.    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ f : ratefunctionsising ]    for a ( non - rigorous ) treatment of metastability and its effect on the rate of convergence to equilibrium in other mean - field models with a first order phase transition , see for example  @xcite . a rigorous analysis of such a system ( the blume - capel model ) , below and above criticality ,",
    "was recently carried out in  @xcite .",
    "it is illuminating to contrast the graph of the free energy as a function of the proportions vector in the potts model to that of the free energy as a function of the magnetization in curie - weiss ising , given in figure  [ f : ratefunctionsising ] .",
    "the second order phase transition and lack of phase coexistence at the critical temperature , implies the absence of a local minima at any value below or above @xmath102 . as a consequence",
    "there is no spinodal temperature and mixing is fast throughout the whole range @xmath120 .",
    "as discussed before , up to a permutation of the vertices , configurations can be described by their proportions vector .",
    "formally , for a configuration @xmath18 , we denote by @xmath122 the @xmath21-dimensional vector @xmath123 , where @xmath124 note that @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "now it is not difficult to see that @xmath127 is itself a markov process with state space @xmath128 and stationary distribution @xmath129 , the distribution of @xmath122 under @xmath30 .",
    "we shall refer to this process as the _ proportions chain_. figures [ f : subcritical ] and [ f : supercritical ] show a realization of the proportion chains superimposed on the free energy graph plotted upside down for better visibility .",
    "3 different values of @xmath87 , corresponding to 3 different regimes are exhibited .",
    "the color of the curve , representing time , shows the temporal evolution of the proportion chain .",
    "notice how local minima ( shown as local maxima ) `` trap '' the chain for a long time .    as a projection of the chain , @xmath86 mixes at least as fast as @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , when starting in one of the @xmath21 configurations where all sites have the same color , a symmetry argument reveals that the mixing time of @xmath86 is equal to that of @xmath130 .",
    "one therefore must control the effect of starting from a initial state which is not monochrome . using a coupling argument",
    "we show that the difference in the mixing times is of the same order as the cutoff window for @xmath86 and can thus be absorbed into our error estimates .",
    "it will then suffice to analyze the proportions chain , which is of a lesser complexity than the original process .",
    "in particular the state space of @xmath86 has a fixed @xmath131 dimension , independently of @xmath5 , and its transition probabilities can be easily calculated .",
    "next , we show that when @xmath82 most of the mass of the stationary distribution @xmath132 is concentrated on _ balanced _ states whose distance from the `` equi - proportionality '' vector @xmath133 is @xmath134 .",
    "a simple coupling argument then shows that the markov chain is mixed soon after arriving at such a state .",
    "thus the main effort in the proof becomes finding sharp estimates on the time is takes for @xmath86 to reach a balanced state from a worst - case initial configuration , in different regimes of @xmath87 .",
    "it turns out that these hitting times are determined by the function @xmath135 , which is defined as ( up to a multiplication by @xmath136 ) the drift of one coordinate of @xmath86 when that coordinate has value @xmath137 in the worst case , i.e.  the minimum drift towards @xmath138 , where the minimum is taken over all possible values for the remaining coordinates . an explicit formula for @xmath135",
    "can be obtained  .",
    "its graph is plotted in figure  [ f : drift ] for @xmath139 $ ] and different values of @xmath87 . for @xmath140 ,",
    "this drift is strictly negative in @xmath141 $ ] and thus each coordinate quickly ( in @xmath49 time ) gets to within @xmath142 of @xmath138 . on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath135 is monotone increasing in @xmath87 and therefore for sufficiently large @xmath87 , it will no longer be negative throughout @xmath141 $ ] - there will be an interval in @xmath141 $ ] where it is positive .",
    "such an interval will take an exponential amount of time to traverse and this will lead to an exponential mixing time .",
    "the smallest @xmath87 for which this happens is , by definition , @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath11 in turn coincides with the inverse temperature at which local minima begin to appear in the free energy as a function of @xmath143 .",
    "in fact , to show exponentially slow mixing , we use standard conductance arguments , which in face of local minima in the free energy give exponential mixing quite automatically .",
    "the most delicate analysis is in the critical regime where @xmath87 is near or equal to @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the @xmath137-axis is tangential to the graph of @xmath135 at its peak ( the green curve in figure  [ f : drift ] ) and the challenge is in finding the asymptotics of the passage time through the tangential point on the @xmath137-axis ( left green dot in the figure ) . as the drift",
    "there is @xmath38 , locally around this point , a coordinate of @xmath86 behaves as a random walk and doob s decomposition of a suitably chosen function of the coordinate yields the right passage time estimates .",
