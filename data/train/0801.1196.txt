    "in recent years , we have witnessed the growth of a number of theories of uncertainty , where imprecise ( lower and upper ) probabilities and previsions , rather than precise ( or point - valued ) probabilities and previsions , have a central part .",
    "here we consider two of them , glenn shafer and vladimir vovk s game - theoretic account of probability @xcite , which is introduced in section  [ sec : shafer - and - vovk ] , and peter walley s behavioural theory @xcite , outlined in section  [ sec : walley ] . these seem to have a rather different interpretation , and they certainly have been influenced by different schools of thought : walley follows the tradition of frank ramsey @xcite , bruno de finetti @xcite and peter williams @xcite in trying to establish a rational model for a subject s beliefs in terms of her behaviour .",
    "shafer and vovk follow an approach that has many other influences as well , and is strongly coloured by ideas about gambling systems and martingales .",
    "they use cournot s principle to interpret lower and upper probabilities ( see @xcite ; and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  2 ) for a nice historical overview ) , whereas on walley s approach , lower and upper probabilities are defined in terms of a subject s betting rates .    what we set out to do here , and in particular in sections  [ sec : connections ] and  [ sec : interpretation ] , is to show that in many practical situations , the two approaches are strongly connected .. ] this implies that quite a few results , valid in one theory , can automatically be converted and reinterpreted in terms of the other .",
    "moreover , we shall see that we can develop an account of coherent immediate prediction in the context of walley s behavioural theory , and prove , in section  [ sec : weak - law ] , a weak law of large numbers with an intuitively appealing interpretation .",
    "we use this weak law in section  [ sec : scoring ] to suggest a way of scoring a predictive model that satisfies a.  philip dawid s _ prequential principle _ @xcite .",
    "why do we believe these results to be important , or even relevant , to ai ?",
    "probabilistic models are intended to represent an agent s beliefs about the world he is operating in , and which describe and even determine the actions he will take in a diversity of situations .",
    "probability theory provides a normative system for reasoning and making decisions in the face of uncertainty .",
    "bayesian , or precise , probability models have the property that they are completely decisive : a bayesian agent always has an optimal choice when faced with a number of alternatives , whatever his state of information . while many may view this as an advantage , it is not always very realistic .",
    "imprecise probability models try to deal with this problem by explicitly allowing for indecision , while retaining the normative , or coherentist stance of the bayesian approach .",
    "we refer to @xcite for discussions about how this can be done .",
    "imprecise probability models appear in a number of ai - related fields .",
    "for instance in _",
    "probabilistic logic _ :",
    "it was already known to george boole @xcite that the result of probabilistic inferences may be a set of probabilities ( an imprecise probability model ) , rather than a single probability .",
    "this is also important for dealing with missing or incomplete data , leading to so - called partial identification of probabilities , see for instance @xcite .",
    "there is also a growing literature on so - called _ credal nets _",
    "@xcite : these are essentially bayesian nets with imprecise conditional probabilities .",
    "we are convinced that it is mainly the mathematical and computational complexity often associated with imprecise probability models that is keeping them from becoming a more widely used tool for modelling uncertainty .",
    "but we believe that the results reported here can help make inroads in reducing this complexity .",
    "indeed , the upshot of our being able to connect walley s approach with shafer and vovk s , is twofold .",
    "first of all , we can develop a theory of _ imprecise probability trees _ : probability trees where the transition from a node to its children is described by an imprecise probability model in walley s sense .",
    "our results provide the necessary apparatus for making inferences in such trees . and",
    "because probability trees are so closely related to random processes , this effectively brings us into a position to start developing a theory of ( event - driven ) random processes where the uncertainty can be described using imprecise probability models .",
    "we illustrate this in examples  [ ex : coins ] and  [ ex : many - coins ] , and in section  [ sec : backwards - recursion ] .    secondly , we are able to prove so - called marginal extension results ( theorems  [ theo : natex ] and  [ theo : concatenation ] , proposition  [ prop : local - models ] ) , which lead to backwards recursion , and dynamic programming - like methods that allow for an exponential reduction in the computational complexity of making inferences in such imprecise probability trees .",
    "this is also illustrated in examples  [ ex : many - coins ] and section  [ sec : backwards - recursion ] . for ( precise ) probability trees ,",
    "similar techniques were described in shafer s book on causal reasoning @xcite .",
    "they seem to go back to christiaan huygens , who drew the first probability tree , and showed how to reason with it , in his solution to pascal and fermat s problem of points . for more details and precise references . ]",
    "in their game - theoretic approach to probability @xcite , shafer and vovk consider a game with two players , reality and sceptic , who play according to a certain _ protocol_. they obtain the most interesting results for what they call _ coherent probability protocols_. this section is devoted to explaining what this means .",
    "we begin with a first and basic assumption , dealing with how the first player , reality , plays .    1 .",
    "reality makes a number of moves , where the possible next moves may depend on the previous moves he has made , but do not in any way depend on the previous moves made by sceptic .",
    "this means that we can represent his game - play by an event tree ( see also @xcite for more information about event trees ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the discussion of _ bounded protocols _ , where reality makes only a finite and bounded number of moves from the beginning to the end of the game , whatever happens .",
    "but we do nt exclude the possibility that at some point in the tree , reality has the choice between an infinite number of next moves .",
    "we shall come back to these assumptions further on , once we have the appropriate notational tools to make them more explicit .",

    "this may be especially relevant for probabilistic inferences involving graphical models , such as credal networks @xcite .",
    "another nice example of this phenomenon , concerned with checking coherence for precise and imprecise probability models , is due to walley _",
    "we have proved the correspondence between the two approaches only for event trees with a bounded horizon . for games with infinite horizon ,",
    "the correspondence becomes less immediate , because shafer and vovk implicitly make use of coherence axioms that are stronger than d1d4 and d5 , leading to lower prices that dominate the corresponding predictive lower previsions .",
    "exact matching would be restored of course , provided we could argue that these additional requirements are rational for any subject to comply with .",
    "this could be an interesting topic for further research .",
    "we havent paid much attention to the special case that the coherent lower previsions and their conjugate upper previsions coincide , and are therefore ( precise ) _ previsions _ or _ fair prices _ in de finetti s @xcite sense .",
    "when all the local predictive models @xmath204 ( see proposition  [ prop : local - models ] ) happen to be precise , meaning that @xmath497 for all gambles @xmath106 on @xmath42 , then the immediate prediction model we have described in section  [ sec : connections ] becomes very closely related , and arguably identical to , the probability trees introduced and studied by shafer in @xcite .",
    "indeed , we then get predictive previsions @xmath498 that can be obtained through concatenation of the local modals @xmath499 , as guaranteed by theorem  [ theo : concatenation ] .",
    "moreover , as indicated in section  [ sec : backwards - recursion ] , it is possible to prove lower envelope theorems to the effect that ( i ) the local lower previsions @xmath204 correspond to lower envelopes of sets @xmath500 of local previsions @xmath499 ; ( ii ) each possible choice of previsions @xmath499 in @xmath500 over all non - terminal situations @xmath9 , leads to a _",
    "compatible _ probability tree in shafer s @xcite sense , with corresponding predictive previsions @xmath498 ; and ( iii ) the predictive lower previsions @xmath501 are the lower envelopes of the predictive previsions @xmath498 for the compatible probability trees .",
    "of course , the law of large numbers of section  [ sec : weak - law ] remains valid for probability trees .",
    "finally , we want to recall that theorem  [ theo : concatenation ] and proposition  [ prop : local - models ] allow for a calculation of the predictive models @xmath501 using only the local models and _ backwards recursion _ , in a manner that is strongly reminiscent of dynamic programming techniques .",
    "this should allow for a much more efficient computation of such predictive models than , say , an approach that exploits lower envelope theorems and sets of probabilities / previsions .",
    "we think that there may be lessons to be learnt from this for dealing with other types of graphical models , such as credal networks @xcite , as well .",
    "what makes this more efficient approach possible is , ultimately , the marginal extension theorem ( theorem  [ theo : natex ] ) , which leads to the concatenation formula ( theorem  [ theo : concatenation ] ) , i.e. , to the specific equality , rather than the general inequalities , in proposition  [ prop : walley].7 . generally speaking ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  6.7 ) and @xcite ) , such marginal extension results can be proved because the models that forecaster specifies are _ local _ , or _ immediate _ prediction models : they relate to her beliefs , in each non - terminal situation @xmath9 , about what move reality is going to make _ immediately after _ getting to @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we give an overview of two approaches to probability theory where lower and upper probabilities , rather than probabilities , are used : walley s behavioural theory of imprecise probabilities , and shafer and vovk s game - theoretic account of probability . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the two theories are more closely related than would be suspected at first sight , and we establish a correspondence between them that ( i ) has an interesting interpretation , and ( ii ) allows us to freely import results from one theory into the other . </S>",
    "<S> our approach leads to an account of probability trees and random processes in the framework of walley s theory . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate how our results can be used to reduce the computational complexity of dealing with imprecision in probability trees , and we prove an interesting and quite general version of the weak law of large numbers . </S>"
