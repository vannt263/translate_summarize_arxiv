    "double - peaked broad balmer emission profiles have been detected in about 200 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 ; strateva et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) .",
    "a systematic survey of 110 sources ( mostly broad - line radio loud agns at @xmath12 ) by eracleous & halpern ( 1994 , 2003 ) suggested that about 20% sources show double - peaked broad balmer lines .",
    "they found some characteristics of double - peaked agns : large full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of h@xmath11 line , ranging from about 4000 ^-1 km s@xmath1  up to 40000 ^-1 km",
    "s@xmath1  ( e.g. wang et al . 2005 ) ; about 50% starlight contribution in optical continuum around h@xmath11 ; large equivalent widths of low - ionization forbidden lines ; large [ o i]/@xmath2 $ ]  ratios .",
    "strateva et al . ( 2003 ) found about 3% of the @xmath13 agns in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are double - peaked agns , the fraction is smaller than that in radio - loud agns sample .",
    "double - peaked lines have also been detected in some low - ionization nuclear emission line regions ( liners ) , e.g. ngc1097 , m81 , ngc4450 ,",
    "ngc4203 , ngc4579 ( storchi - bergmann et al . 1993 ; bower et al . 1996 ; shields et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al .",
    "2000 ; barth et al .",
    "it remains a matter as debate of the origin of the double - peaked profiles .",
    "there are mainly three models to interpret the origin of the double - peaked profiles : the accretion disk ( chen & halpern 1989 ; eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 ; gezari et al .",
    "2007 ) ; the biconical outflow ( zheng et al . 1991 ; abajas et al . 2006 ) , and an anisotropic illuminated blrs ( goad & wanders 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , observational test and physical consideration preferentially suggested that double - peaked profiles originate from the accretion disk within a radius from a few hundreds @xmath14 to about thousands @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the smbh mass ) ( eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 ; eracleous et al .",
    "1997 ; strateva et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; gezari , et al .",
    "2007 ) . in order to interpret the sparsity of double - peaked agns ,",
    "the origin of the single - peaked lines from accretion disk have been discussed ( eracleous & halpern 2003 and the references therein ) : larger out radius of the line - emitting accretion disk ; face - on accretion disk ; and the accretion disk wind .",
    "very few of the double - peaked high - ionization line profiles ( e.g. civ ) is due to that these high ionization lines are thought to arise in a wind , not in the disk .",
    "the masses of central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) can provide an important tool to understand the physics of double - peaked agns if we reliably estimate them ( e.g. lewis & eracleous 2006 ; lewis 2006 ) . during the last decade",
    ", there is a striking progress on the study of central supermassive black holes .",
    "the stellar and/or gaseous dynamics is used to derive the smbhs masses in nearby inactive galaxies .",
    "however , for agns , this method is very difficult because nuclei outshine their hosts .",
    "fortunately , we can use the broad emission lines from blrs ( e.g. h@xmath4 , h@xmath11 , mg @xmath17 , c@xmath18 ) to estimate smbh masses in agns by the reverberation mapping method and the empirical size - luminosity relation ( kaspi et al . 2000,2005 ; vestergaard 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; wu et al .",
    "2004 ; greene & ho 2006a ) .",
    "there is a scaling factor with larger uncertainty , which is due to the unknown geometry and dynamics of broad line regions , blrs ( e.g. krolik 2001 ; collin et al .",
    "nearby galaxies and agns seem to follow the same tight @xmath19 relation , where @xmath20 is the bulge velocity dispersion at eighth of the effective radius of the galaxy ( nelson et al .",
    "2001 ; tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ; greene & ho 2006a , 2006b ) , although it remains controversial for narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) ( mathur et al . 2001 ; bian & zhao 2004 ; grupe & mathur 2004 ; watson et al .",
    "lewis & eracleous ( 2006 ) derived the black hole masses from @xmath0 through fitting absorption lines of the ca ii triplet ( @xmath21 ) for 5 double - peaked agns .",
    "therefore the determination of the black hole mass from independent method of reverberation mapping is an useful prober to explore mysteries of the double peaked agns .",
    "significant stellar contribution in double - peaked agns makes the measurement of @xmath0 possible and reliable . here",

    "they used two steps to select candidates : ( 1 ) they selected the unusual ones from the symmetric lines using the spectral principal component analysis ( pca ) ( hao et al .",
    "2003 ) ; and ( 2 ) they fitted the h@xmath11 region with a combination of several gaussians , and only selected agns better fitted by two gaussians . from the profiles of the broad components ,",
    "several fitting parameters including the positions of the red and blue peaks ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , the corresponding peak heights ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) , fwhms were given in their table 3 .",

    "( 2003 ) , the projected fiber aperture diameter is 13.2 kpc , typically containing about 80% of the total host galaxy light ( kauffmann & heckman 2005 ) .",
    "the stellar absorption features in these sdss spectra provide us the possibility to measure the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "we did not apply aperture corrections to the stellar velocity dispersions because this effect can be omitted for @xmath30 ( bernardi et al .",

    "when the h@xmath11 fwhm is fixed , they found that the partial correlation coefficient is only 0.05 . in this paper , we use the stellar velocity dispersion to estimate the black hole masses , and we also find a mild correlation between @xmath139 and @xmath144 , which implies that the peak separation would be smaller for agns with higher eddington ratios .",
    "it provides clues to why previous double - peaked agns have lower eddington ratios .",
    "there is increasing evidence for a disk geometry of the blr ( see a review of laor 2007 ) .",
    "if we assume that peak separation is created by the doppler shift of the movement of a thin annulus and the annulus radius corresponds the location where the self - gravitation domiantes ( bian & zhao 2002 ) , we have the radius @xmath145 ( their eq . 18 in laor & netzer 1989 ) , where @xmath146  cm , @xmath147 , @xmath148 is the eddington ratio and @xmath11 is the viscosity .",

    "considering the uncertainties of the fitting results for the peak separation correlations with smbh mass and the eddington ratio , the slopes are consistent with the simple theoretical expectation .",
    "we have to stress that equation ( 11 ) is for the maximum separation ( edge - on orientation ) when the disk structure is given .",
    "more sophisticated model is needed for explanations of the dependence of peak separations and eddington ratios .",
    "the scatters in fig 7 may be caused by different orientation of the blr in the sample .",
    "we also find no significant correlations between the ratio of the red peak height to the blue height and the eddington ratio , the black hole mass , the peak separation .",
    "since the keplerian velocity is much below the light speed , the doppler boosting effects could be hidden by complex situations of the blr .",
    "here we discuss the energy budget of the line - emitting accretion disk .",
    "based on the standard accretion disk model , the disk radiation as a function of radius @xmath152 is ( chen et al .",

    "our results show that only 36 out of 105 double - peaked agns would generate enough power to produce observed strength of h@xmath11 emission . if we adopt the value of 10% , more objects ( 83 out of 105 objects ) showed the energy problem .",
    "it implied that the majority of double - peaked agns need external illumination of the disk ( e.g. an inner iron torus or corona ) to produce the observed strength of h@xmath11 line ( strateva et al .",
