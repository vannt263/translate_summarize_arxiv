    "computational electronic structure theory for real materials depends on the use of simplifying approximations for the many - electron problem .",
    "two successful approaches have been the use of density functional theory and many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the density functional approach is overwhelmingly dominated by the local - density approximation ( lda ) of kohn and sham @xcite , and extensions thereof , such as gradient corrections or self - interaction corrections .",
    "the many - electron problem is mapped onto an effective non - interacting electron problem and solved for the ground - state density and energy .",
    "the limitation of this approach lies in the fact that in principle it gives no access to the excitation spectrum of the system under study , even if approximations for the exchange and correlation potential are further refined .",
    "this limitation is felt particularly severely in semiconductor physics , where many of the phenomena of interest are centered on properties of the excited states . for this class of materials hybertsen and",
    "louie@xcite showed that the @xmath0 approximation , first proposed by hedin@xcite in 1965 , allows computation of band gaps in remarkably good agreement with experiment for a series of semiconducting and insulating materials .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation gives a comparatively simple expression for the self - energy operator , which allows the one - particle green s function of an interacting many - electron system to be described in terms of the green s function of a hypothetical non - interacting system with an effective potential .",
    "the green s function contains information not only about the ground state density and energy but also about the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation has still proved computationally very expensive and has mainly been used to determine the quasiparticle spectrum of bulk semiconductors and insulators @xcite , although progress has also been made in the treatment of systems such as surfaces@xcite , clusters@xcite and simple polymers@xcite .",
    "the issue of self - consistency has only begun to be addressed fairly recently@xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for total energy calculations , where thorough investigations so far have been made only for the homogeneous electron gas@xcite .",
    "first @xmath0 calculations of the charge density of si and ge have been performed recently@xcite .",
    "the method we describe in this paper substantially reduces the computational effort needed to study larger systems .",
    "the core idea was outlined in a letter by rojas , godby , and needs@xcite .",
    "here we give a full account of the method and detailed aspects of our implementation .",
    "the improvements in efficiency over traditional implementations of the @xmath0 approximation in a reciprocal - space formalism result from choosing the representation most suitable to the computational step being undertaken , either reciprocal space or real space on the one hand and imaginary time or imaginary energy on the other , and switching between representations easily with the help of fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) .",
    "the choice of representing the time / energy dependence on the imaginary instead of on the real axis allows us to deal with smooth , decaying quantities which give faster convergence . to obtain the self - energy eventually on the real energy axis ,",
    "we fit a model function to the computed self - energy on the imaginary axis , and continue it analytically to the real axis .",

    "section iii describes the essential concepts of the @xmath0 space - time method . in the fourth section",
    "we outline detailed aspects of the implementation such as mesh discretisation and exploitation of symmetry . in section",
    "v we discuss the analytic continuation procedure for the self - energy , and subsequent determination of the quasiparticle energies . in the sixth section we present results for bulk silicon and silicon with artificially increased unit cell sizes , and discuss scaling behaviour for these examples .",

    "the central idea of hedin s @xmath0 approximation is to approximate the self - energy operator @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an infinitesimally small positive time , @xmath2 is the screened coulomb interaction , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coulomb interaction @xmath9 and @xmath1 is the one - particle green s function . @xmath1 itself depends on @xmath4 through the dyson equation and should arguably be determined self - consistently . in practice , however , in almost all calculations for real systems @xmath1 has been approximated by the non - interacting green s function at the lda level , i.  e. , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a positive ( negative ) infinitesimal for occupied ( unoccupied ) one - particle states .",

    "once the self - energy operator is known we can employ first - order perturbation theory in @xmath21 to compute quasiparticle corrections to the lda eigenenergies ( see section [ qpecorr ] ) .",
    "the traditional way to set up and solve the equations for the @xmath0 approximation has been to express and compute all quantities in the reciprocal - space and energy domain , using a plasmon - pole model for the energy dependence of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "to compute @xmath15 ( eq .  ( [ p0rpa ] ) ) and @xmath4 ( eq .  ( [ sigma ] ) ) this involves sums scaling with the fourth power of the number of plane waves @xmath22 used to represent the wavefunctions and quadratically with the number of energy points @xmath23 used to represent the energy dependence , whereas the scaling in the real space and time domain is quadratic in @xmath22 and linear in @xmath23 , since convolutions in the reciprocal - space and energy domain become simple multiplications in the real - space and time domain .",
    "the expressions for @xmath24 and @xmath2 , on the other hand , are more efficiently calculated in a reciprocal - space and energy representation .",
    "as fast fourier transforms permit us to switch between representations with a numerical cost that scales like @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number of points involved in the fft , we can efficiently exploit the advantages offered by the one or other representation .",
    "the time- or energy - dependence of the quantities involved shows a structure that is not easily represented on an equidistant grid suitable for an fft .",
    "however , we can rigorously analytically continue the quantities to the imaginary time or energy axes where the structure is much smoother and therefore amenable to a representation on an equidistant grid .",
    "this point is illustrated by fig .  1 of ref .   which shows the energy dependence on the real and imaginary axis of the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath27 of jellium with a density parameter of @xmath28 .",
    "the rather ragged shape on the real energy axis contrasts with the smooth shape on the imaginary energy axis .",
    "we emphasise that , while the same amount of physical information is contained for @xmath4 or similar functions on the real or imaginary time or energy axis , to obtain a well converged final answer for quantities that go through several fourier transformations , the important information is more easily represented in imaginary time / energy , in much the same way that the choice of basis set can reduce the effort needed to satisfactorily represent wavefunctions .",
    "this is also shown in plots of the self - energy in section [ results ] , where it can be seen that the smooth form of the self - energy on the imaginary axis still allows stable and accurate reproduction of the more complicated behaviour on the real axis .",
    "using the imaginary time / energy representation allows us to explicitly take the time- or energy - dependence into account without having to rely on a plasmon - pole or other model for most of the calculation . only after the full imaginary - energy dependence of the expectation values of the self - energy operator has been established do we use a fitted model function ( whose sophistication may be increased as necessary with negligible expense ) , which we then analytically continue to the real energy axis to compute the quasiparticle energies .",
    "the fourier transforms between the complex axes work like their counterparts on the real axes , except that additional factors of @xmath29 have to be included : @xmath30 @xmath31 mathematically they can be understood as laplace transforms followed by analytic continuation to the imaginary axis .",

    "@xcite for calculating the polarizability and dielectric function of periodic systems .",
    "a mixed - space representation was also used and described by godby , sham and schlter @xcite for @xmath0 calculations , albeit without referring to it by that name .",
    "blase et al.@xcite discuss the computational efficiency of the ms scheme in comparison with a direct real - space ( rs ) approach . in fig .  2 of ref",
    "they show how the number of @xmath76 pairs which have to be computed in order to set up the polarizability @xmath77 for one @xmath78 in the ms method ( using a @xmath79 monkhorst - pack @xmath78 grid ) depends on the range of interaction ( non - locality range ) @xmath80 .",
    "they compare this to the number of @xmath76 pairs obtained by confining @xmath81 to a sphere of radius @xmath80 which is assumed to be the corresponding number of pairs to be computed in a rs method .",
    "this is somewhat misleading since  as is discussed above  the size of the ic in real space is determined by the size of the @xmath78 grid of the conjugate mixed- or reciprocal - space quantity .",
    "hence it does not make sense to increase the interaction sphere beyond the boundaries of this ic which correspond to a non - locality range of @xmath80=14.5 a.u . for a @xmath79 @xmath78 grid .",
    "furthermore , the real - space quantity @xmath82 contains information on all @xmath78 points .",
    "so for a proper comparison between the two methods the number of pairs given in ref .   for the ms approach has to be multiplied by the number of special @xmath78 points which is 10 for a @xmath79 monkhorst - pack grid .",
    "the statement made in ref .   that the calculation of @xmath83 requires a double bz summation in the real - space scheme -",
    "as opposed to a single bz summation in the ms scheme - does not hold any more if the green s function is set up in mixed space and then fourier transformed to real space , as described in section [ greenpol ] below .",
    "so far we have established the nature of the grids in real and reciprocal space that are suitable for use with the discrete fourier transform .",
    "these grids fill a wigner - seitz - cell shaped volume which in turn can be uniquely mapped onto a parallelepiped , the shape that is required by the discrete fourier transforms . however , the starting point of the @xmath0 calculation is the output of a standard lda calculation using plane waves and pseudopotentials which determines the fourier coefficients of the wavefunctions @xmath84 for all reciprocal lattice vectors that lie within a sphere defined by @xmath85 less than some cutoff .",
    "the rc must therefore be big enough to comprise all of these ` shifted spheres '",
    ". the volume of the smallest possible such cell will be typically 2 to 4 times larger than the volume of the individual spheres .",
    "furthermore , to strictly prevent aliasing in the steps where we replace a convolution in one representation by a multiplication in the conjugate representation , we would have to choose the grid for the ffts twice as large as this minimal cell in every dimension , increasing the volume by a factor of eight .",
    "this means that the fft grid would have to comprise between 16 and 32 times more points than the initial lda calculation had reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "we have found that in practice aliasing effects are very small once we choose enough plane waves for good overall convergence , and in the limit of an infinite number of plane waves any aliasing effects vanish strictly along with any other error caused by truncation of the set of reciprocal lattice vectors . therefore it would not be justified to accept the huge overhead imposed by the doubling of the grid size in all dimensions , and we usually restrict our fft grid to the minimum wigner - seitz cell as defined above , leaving us with an fft grid with between 2 and 4 times as many points as the lda calculation used reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the computational effort can be further reduced by physical considerations .",
    "the fft grid fills a wigner - seitz cell shaped volume in either space .",
    "however , if we assume in real space that the range of non - locality is uniform in all directions we can neglect all the points in the interaction cell outside the largest possible sphere inscribed into it .",
    "similarly we can usually assume that the fourier coefficients in reciprocal space fall to zero after an equal length in all directions and thus we can cut back in reciprocal space to the largest possible sphere inscribed into the rc lattice .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that for symmetry reasons it is the vectors @xmath86 which must fit into the sphere and not merely the vectors @xmath61 .",
    "as the @xmath0 space - time method is primarily designed to enable larger systems to be studied within the framework of the @xmath0 approximation , in this section we study the scaling of the computational cost with system size .",
    "to gauge the cost of a calculation , we first look at the real - space , imaginary - time representation .",
    "what matters here is the number of points in the irreducible wedge of the unit cell , the number of points in the interaction cell and the number of points on the imaginary time axis . we will discuss the time dependence of the operators in the next section and concentrate here on the spatial dimensions .",
    "since in our setup the grid spacing in the unit cell and in the interaction cell are chosen equal , the three factors determining the cost of the calculation are the size of the iuc , which is a system property , and the size of the interaction cell and the grid spacing , which are convergence parameters .",
    "the setting up of the green s function is the starting point for the @xmath0 calculation .",
    "we take the fourier coefficients of the lattice - periodic part of the bloch functions , @xmath87 , and the eigenvalues @xmath13 from a previous standard lda calculation .",
    "the eigenvalues are expressed on an energy scale with zero at the fermi energy , which for semiconductors and insulators is taken to be in the middle of the band gap .",

    "the transformation to real space brings in another factor of @xmath93 , the number of unit cells contained in the interaction cell , ( disregarding the additional factor of @xmath94 from the fft ) , so that the overall scaling is like @xmath95 . since the number of bands is determined by a cutoff energy that is constant for a given material , @xmath90 will grow linearly with system size .",
    "the computational cost at this stage therefore scales quadratically with system size assuming a fixed size of interaction cell ( i.  e. , fixed range of non - locality ) .",
    "additional care is necessary once the unit cell outgrows the range of non - locality . in this case",
    "there is only a single @xmath35 point necessary and the transformation between mixed and real space is redundant . to prevent a crossover to cubic scaling the interaction cell",

    "the head of the polarizability goes to zero like @xmath111 thus cancelling the @xmath112 divergence of the coulomb potential at @xmath113 , yielding a finite value for the head of @xmath114 whereas the lowest - order term for the wings @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath116 , cancelling the @xmath117 divergence of @xmath118 and yielding a finite @xmath119 .",
    "head , wings and body of the inverse dielectric matrix are then obtained in terms of head , wings and body of the dielectric matrix by block - wise inversion as described by pick , cohen and martin@xcite .",
    "the inversion of the dielectric matrix can be performed either in mixed space or in reciprocal space .",
    "while this is strictly equivalent if the whole fft grid is used in either space , it is important to look at ways to reduce the grid size without compromising the exactness of the result , as the matrix inversion is in fact the one operation in the computational sequence which scales worst with system size ( unless sparseness is exploited , see below ) and will therefore be the bottleneck for large systems .",
    "in mixed space we have to invert square matrices of dimension @xmath69 for every @xmath35 point in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ( ibz ) .",
    "first we look at the case where the ic is in no dimension smaller than the uc . we are then dealing with the inversion of fully occupied square matrices , which scales cubicly with the dimension of the matrix , so that the inversions together scale like @xmath120 .",
    "this number is essentially the same as @xmath121 , small differences arising possibly because of the coarseness of the grid .",
    "this shows that the scaling is quadratic with system size for constant ic size and constant @xmath122 .",
    "if the increase of the unit cell size means also a lowering of symmetry , an additional factor corresponding to the symmetry reduction comes in . transforming to reciprocal space and cutting back to a set of reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath61 within a sphere as described earlier reduces the dimension of the matrices by a factor of 2 to 4 , which speeds up the inversions by a factor of 8 to 64 , because of the cubic scaling .",
    "this is the procedure we choose routinely in our calculations .",
    "if the unit cell size exceeds the interaction cell size in one or more dimensions the matrix in mixed space becomes sparse , as all those elements for which @xmath74 is outside the ic become zero .",
    "this sparseness can be exploited to the effect that the matrix inversion scales only as @xmath123 , so that the overall scaling with system size remains the same . however , in the scheme we are employing at the moment this sparseness is not yet explicitly exploited so that we are in fact dealing with a situation where the ic grows with the uc , leading for the matrix inversion to an @xmath124 scaling once the unit cell outgrows the interaction cell .      the screened coulomb interaction is defined in real space as @xmath125 the convolution on the right hand side is again best dealt with as a multiplication in reciprocal space @xmath126 however , in a semiconductor and in metals for frequencies other than zero , @xmath2 is truly long ranged , and therefore diverges for zero wavevectors . in order to avoid problems ( in the @xmath127 and @xmath128 fft ) associated with the resulting long - range tail and ( in the @xmath129 fft ) with the asymptotic frequency dependence we separate @xmath2 into a long - range part which is immediately set up in real space and a short - range part @xmath130 which is first computed in reciprocal space . from the long - range behavior of the dielectric function we find the isotropic part of the screened interaction in the long - range limit @xmath131 so that we can define a short - ranged part @xmath130 of @xmath2 @xmath132    @xmath130 has well - defined fourier coefficients for all reciprocal vectors .",
    "it can thus be computed in reciprocal space .",
    "the long - range part is set up in real space with @xmath133 determined from the small - wavevector behavior of the inverse dielectric matrix in reciprocal space , i.  e. , the head of the inverse dielectric matrix @xmath134 : @xmath135    even though the interaction is truly long - ranged we only need to set it up inside the ic because we aim to calculate the self - energy whose range is determined by that of the ( short - ranged ) green s function @xmath136 .",
    "hence , at this point , it is sufficient to take the contribution of the long - range part of w into account properly _ within _ the ic .",
    "the coulomb potential at @xmath137 is approximated by the average over a sphere around @xmath137 with the same volume as one real - space grid cell .",
    "the self - energy operator is set up in the real - space and imaginary - time domain : @xmath138 within the discrete - grid and finite - range approximation a complete description is given if @xmath56 is restricted to the iuc and @xmath74 to an ic around @xmath56 .",
    "the scaling is again linear with @xmath139 for fixed @xmath67 .      to compute the expectation values of @xmath4 between wavefunctions at the special @xmath35 points , we transform @xmath4 to mixed space and form the matrix elements @xmath140 this operation again scales quadratically with the number of points in the uc for any given set of quantum numbers @xmath141 . for a general point * q * in the first brillouin zone that is not on our discrete grid , we generate interpolated values through the formula @xmath142",
    "in order to calculate the quasiparticle corrections to the lda eigenvalues we require the self - energy operator as a function of real energy , and thus a key requirement for our imaginary time method is the ability to obtain the expectation values of @xmath4 on the real energy axis accurately from the imaginary energy behaviour . from complex analysis we know that if two functions are equal over any arc in the complex plane then they are equal everywhere in their common region of analyticity . we know from the structure of @xmath1 and @xmath2 that @xmath143 ( @xmath144 denoting complex energy ) has poles in the second and fourth quadrant of the complex plane .",
    "if we know the analytic form of the expectation values of the self - energy on the imaginary energy axis we can analytically continue it from the negative imaginary energy axis to the negative real energy axis , and from the positive imaginary to the positive real axis , without crossing any branch cuts .",
    "to obtain such an analytic form , we fit a multipole model function for each pair of quantum numbers @xmath141 to the values @xmath145 : @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are complex fit parameters and @xmath144 is the complex energy . in fig .",
    "[ fitqual ] the resulting fitted form of the correlation ( energy - dependent ) part of the self - energy @xcite is compared with the calculated matrix elements for bands at the @xmath149 and @xmath150 points ( the fits are plotted with the same line styles as the respective calculated matrix elements , they are on this scale indistinguishable from the latter ) .",
    "a simple two - pole model ( @xmath151 ) performs very successfully for si , with the fitted function reproducing the actual values with an rms error of less than 0.2% . including several further poles in the fitted form proves to be stable but unnecessary , although more poles are expected to be required for systems with multiple natural energy scales . for the analytic continuation to be valid",

    "the parameters @xmath152 should in principle be zero , as @xmath153 . allowing a small finite value for @xmath152",
    "has proved helpful in the fits , though , and as we are interested mainly in energies close to the fermi energy and not the long - range limit this is perfectly legitimate . since @xmath154 it is sufficient to fit only one half - axis .",
    "convergence of the quasiparticle energies with respect to the parameters of the time - energy transform grid is discussed in the next section , but it is also important to consider as a separate question the stability of the analytic continuation procedure . in particular",
    "if we are to achieve smooth convergence it is important that changes in the calculated self - energy on the real axis correspond to genuine changes in the calculated @xmath155 , and are not simply resulting from instabilities in the fitting procedure . in figures",
    "[ convmax ] and [ convdelta ] we show the convergence behaviour of a matrix element @xmath155 at @xmath149 with respect to number and spacing of the energy points respectively , and the corresponding form of the analytically continued element .",
    "it can be seen that the fitting approach is indeed stable , with the convergence of @xmath156 being dictated directly by changes in the calculated @xmath155 .",
    "thus the task of converging the quasiparticle energies is equivalent to converging the self - energy on the imaginary axis , with very little comparative loss of accuracy in the analytic continuation procedure itself .",
    "the parameter @xmath157 ( describing the energy range used in the calculation ) mainly determines the convergence of the large - energy region of @xmath158 .",
    "the energy grid spacing @xmath159 predominantly affects the convergence of @xmath160 in the region close to @xmath161= 0 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath162 ( on the whole real energy axis ) is more sensitive to the shape of @xmath160 in this region of the imaginary axis than to the large - imaginary - energy tail of the latter ( see also next paragraph ) .",
    "that is why the convergence with respect to @xmath159 shown in fig .",
    "[ convdelta ] appears to be better on the imaginary axis than on the real axis .",
    "our investigations of the convergence of the calculated matrix elements of the correlation part of the self - energy and the resulting quasiparticle energies with respect to @xmath157 have shown that good convergence can be achieved by keeping the energy range for the fitting procedure fixed rather than fitting the whole range of energies @xmath163 when increasing the latter . the energy range for fitting the matrix elements @xmath164",
    "was fixed to ( @xmath1655 har , + 5 har ) in the present calculation ( the results are not sensitive to the exact value ) . the reason for restricting the fit range for @xmath166 is that most information is contained in the form of this function at imaginary energies reasonably close to @xmath167 .",
    "thus , fitting a large range , beyond a certain point , will mean that this part of the shape will be less accurately described due to the loss of weight in this region .",
