    "`` information '' is by its nature _ broadcastable_. what happens when information is quantum and we need to distribute it among many users ? indeed , this may be useful in all situations where quantum information is required in sharable form , e.  g. in distributed quantum computation @xcite , for quantum shared secrecy @xcite , and , generally , in quantum game - theoretical contexts @xcite .",
    "however , contrarily to the case of classical information , which can be distributed at will , broadcasting quantum information can be done only in a limited fashion .",
    "indeed , for pure states ideal broadcasting is equivalent to the so - called `` quantum cloning '' , which is impossible due to the well - known `` no - cloning '' theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is more involved when the input states are mixed , since broadcasting can be achieved with an output joint state which is indistinguishable from the tensor product of local mixed states from the point of view of individual receivers .",
    "therefore , the no cloning theorem can not logically exclude the possibility of ideal broadcasting for sufficiently mixed states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proved that perfect broadcasting is impossible from a single input copy to two output copies for an input set of non mutually commuting density operators .",
    "this result was then considered ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) as an evidence of the general impossibility of broadcasting mixed states drawn from a non - commuting set in a more general scenario , where @xmath1 equally prepared input copies",
    "are broadcast to @xmath2 users . however , for sufficiently many input copies @xmath3 and sufficiently mixed input states the no - broadcasting theorem does not generally hold @xcite , and for input mixed states drawn from a noncommuting set it is possible to generate @xmath2 output local mixed states which are identical to the input ones , by a joint correlated state",
    "actually , as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is even possible to partially purify the local state in the broadcasting process , for sufficiently mixed input states .",
    "such a process of simultaneous purification and broadcasting was named _",
    "superbroadcasting_. for qubits , the fully covariant superbroadcasting channel that maximizes the output purity ( i. e. the length of the output bloch vectors of local states ) when applied to input pure states coincides with the optimal cloning map  @xcite",
    ".    the possibility of superbroadcasting does not increase the available information about the original input state , due to unavoidable detrimental correlations among the local broadcast copies , which do not allow to exploit their statistics ( a similar phenomenon was already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . essentially , superbroadcasting transfers noise from local states to correlations . from the point of view of single users",
    ", however , the protocol is a purification in all respects , and this opens new interesting perspectives in the ability of distributing quantum information in a noisy environment , and deserves to be analyzed in depth . for qubits , it has been shown that for universal superbroadcasting is possible with at least @xmath4 input copies @xcite .",
    "is this the absolute minimum number for superbroadcasting , or does it hold only for this particular set of input states ? in this paper",
    "we will show that , indeed , for equatorial mixed states of qubits the minimum number is @xmath5 .",
    "however , for smaller non - commuting sets of qubit states the possibility of superbroadcasting with only @xmath6 input copies is still an open problem ( for larger dimension @xmath7 it is possible to superbroadcast also for @xmath6 , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    we want to point put that clearly there are limitations to superbroadcasting",
    ". the input state must be indeed sufficiently mixed , since pure states can not be broadcast by the no cloning theorem .",
    "however , states with a pretty high purity can sill be superbroadcast , e.  g. for universally covariant superbroadcasting @xcite from @xmath4 to @xmath8 it is possible to superbroadcast states with a bloch vector length up to 0.787 ( 0.935 for the phase covariant case ) .",
    "one can achieve superbroadcasting with even higher input purity for increasing @xmath3 , approaching unit input bloch vector length in the limit of infinitely many input copies .",
    "there are also some limitations in the absolute number of output copies for which one can achieve superbroadcasting .",
    "e.  g. in the universal case , for @xmath4 input copies one can superbroadcast up to @xmath9 output copies , for @xmath10 up to @xmath11 , and for @xmath12 up to infinitely many .",
    "the output purity is clearly decreasing versus @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we will further analyze all limitations to superbroadcasting also for the case of equatorial input qubits .",
    "regarding the possibility of achieving superbroadcasting experimentally , the first route to explore is to use the same techniques as for purification @xcite , since the superbroadcasting map for @xmath2 generalizes the purification map using the same protocol @xcite .",
    "this transformation involves a measurement of the total angular momentum of the qubits , then an optimal werner cloning  @xcite in the universal case ( or an optimal phase covariant cloning  @xcite in the phase covariant case ) .",
    "another possibility is to use the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to classify all possible unitary realizations , and then seek for experimentally achievable ones using current technology .    in this paper",
    "we present phase covariant superbroadcasting , and also give a complete derivation of the universal superbroadcasting map , presented in ref .",
    "the two maps are derived in a unified theoretical framework .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s : symm - broad ]",
    "we introduce some preliminary notions regarding symmetric covariant maps . in sects . [",
    "s : univ ] and [ s : pc ] we give a complete derivation of the optimal broadcasting maps in the universal case and in the phase covariant case respectively . in sect .",

    "[ s : conc ] we summarize and comment the main results of this paper . at the end of the paper",
    "we report the details of the calculations needed to derive the results presented in three appendices .",
    "in this section we introduce in a unified theoretical framework some preliminary concepts that will be employed to describe covariant symmetric qubit broadcasting maps .",
    "these concepts will be then specified to the universal and the phase covariant cases in the subsequent sections .",
    "a main tool we will extensively use in deriving the optimal maps is the formalism of the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite between completely positive ( cp ) maps @xmath14 from states on the hilbert space @xmath15 to states on the hilbert space @xmath16 , and positive bipartite operators @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",

    "we will consider maps @xmath36 from states of @xmath3 qubits to states of @xmath13 qubits , namely cp maps from states on @xmath37 to states on @xmath38 .",
    "we will consider in particular symmetric broadcasting maps , namely transformations where all receivers get the same reduced state .",
    "the figures of merit which are commonly used are invariant under permutations of the output copies , and this allows to assume that the output state of a broadcasting map is permutation invariant without loss of generality .",
    "moreover , since the input consists in @xmath3 copies of the same state , there is no loss of generality in requiring that the map is also invariant under permutations of the input copies . these two properties , according to eqs .",

    "notice that permutations representations are all real , hence @xmath42 .",
    "a useful tool to deal with unitary group representations @xmath30 of a group @xmath28 on a hilbert space @xmath15 is the wedderburn decomposition of @xmath15 @xmath43 where the index @xmath44 labels the equivalence classes of irreducible representations which appear in the decomposition of @xmath30 . the spaces @xmath45 support the irreducible representations and @xmath46 are the multiplicity spaces , with dimension @xmath47 equal to the degeneracy of the @xmath44-th irreducible representation .",
    "correspondingly the representation @xmath30 decomposes as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is shorthand for @xmath50 . by schur",
    "s lemma , every operator @xmath25 commuting with the representation @xmath30 in turn decomposes as @xmath51    in the case of permutation invariance , the so - called schur - weyl duality @xcite holds , namely the spaces @xmath46 for permutations of @xmath13 qubits coincide with the spaces @xmath45 for the representation @xmath52 of @xmath53 , where @xmath30 is the defining representation .",
    "in other words , a permutation invariant operator @xmath54 can act non trivially only on the spaces @xmath45 , namely it can be decomposed as @xmath55 the clebsch - gordan series for the defining representation of @xmath53 is well - known in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) , and its wedderburn decomposition is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 equals 0 for @xmath13 even , 1/2 for @xmath13 odd , and @xmath59    in the case of the broadcasting maps the hilbert space @xmath18 on which the operator @xmath17 acts , supports the two permutation representations corresponding to the output and input qubits permutations .",

    "we have now all the tools to study symmetric qubits broadcasting devices . in this work",

    "an interesting issue , for example , is that they can not be erased leaving the local state unchanged ( the de - correlating map  which sends a state to the tensor product of its partial traces  is non linear ) , and this raises the problem of the optimal de - correlating channel , which optimizes the fidelity between the input and the output local state .",
    "such optimal channel can be derived using the same technique for optimal covariant maps used in the present paper .    finally , distributing quantum information  and in particular superbroadcasting ",
    "raises the new problem of the trade - off between broadcasting and cryptographic security . indeed , on one side , the presence of many identical uses seems to open more possibilities of eavesdropping , however the detrimental correlations may drastically reduce such possibility , and the opportunity of detecting the eavesdropping on the joint output state may be exploited to increase the security .",
