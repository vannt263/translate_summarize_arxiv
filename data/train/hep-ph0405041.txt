    "the growing amount of the experimental data on the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) attracts attentions of the high energy spin community .",
    "this is understandable since the perturbative quantum chromo - dynamics ( pqcd ) predicts a zero spin effect at the asymptotic energy , while the experiments furnish up to now the opposite signatures .",
    "for example , ssa shows to be nonzero at the rhic energy of @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore the different approaches , not so strongly justified as pqcd , but able to explain all ssa effects are needed . + in 1988 the model was proposed @xcite for interpretation of the ssa in inclusive pion productions and @xmath5 inclusive polarization .",
    "the model was able to describe the scarce data existing at that time .",
    "those experimental data came up from the unpolarized beams striking the polarized target and such experiments suffer from the poor statistical accuracies . since later a lot of new data were published and mostly from the interaction of the polarized beams with pure hydrogen target . recently",
    "the polarized relativistic heavy ion collider ( prhic ) becomes operational and the first data on the ssa for inclusive @xmath6 were published @xcite .",
    "the proza experiment at ihep , protvino , produced for the first time the data on ssa in the polarized proton target fragmentation region using unpolarized proton and pion beams .",
    "+ the main goal of this article is to apply the chromo - magnetic string model ( cmsm ) of the paper @xcite to the new experimental data on the inclusive pion asymmetries .",
    "the cmsm offers a simple analytical expression for ssa description .",
    "the original paper was devoted mostly to the interpretation of the ssa in inclusive @xmath6 production . in current paper",
    "we extend the cmsm to the description of the ssa in the inclusive charged pion production too .",
    "+ in section 1 we remind the main features of cmsm according to @xcite .",
    "the formulae of cmsm are specified for two distinct kinematic regions : the central ( cr ) and beam fragmentation ( bf ) region .",
    "section 2 describes the application of the model to the cr , while the section 3 is devoted to the bf region .",
    "also in section 3 we expand the model to the ssa in the inclusive charged pion productions .",
    "the unique data of e704 experiment on the ssa obtained with the polarized antiproton beam are analyzed too in scope of the isotopic spin and charge conservations . in summary",
    "we outline the successes and fails of the cmsm in description of the ssa in inclusive pion production at high energy .",
    "we make some predictions and indicate the possible improvements of the cmsm model .",
    "the basis of this model is following .",
    "after collision of two hadrons the color tube ( string ) is stretched between them . in simple case this tube contains the flux of the chromo - electric field .",
    "but such a system is not stable . in order to make it stable",
    "the chromo - magnetic field should circulate around this tube .",
    "the interaction of this field with the color magnetic moment of the polarized quark leads to a kick transverse to the string axis .",
    "this kick depends on the spin orientation of the polarized quark .",
    "the estimate of this kick gives a magnitude of order @xmath7 gev / c @xcite .",
    "if we introduce the invariant differential cross section @xmath8 for polarized quark asymmetry we get the relation @xmath9 where ( + ) and ( - ) arguments in @xmath10 mean the up and down direction of the quark polarization . since @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a transverse momentum of the final pion to which the polarized quark fragments we get the following left - right asymmetry in the quark emission @xmath13 here b is a slope parameter of @xmath10 as it is defined in standard way . @xmath14 the general formula for description of the ssa can be expressed in the following form @xmath15 here @xmath16 is a polarization of an initial quark , carrying a portion x of the initial polarized proton momentum , @xmath17 is so called a quark `` analyzing power '' defined above ( [ qas ] ) ; w(x ) presents a fractional contribution of a channel of interest in parton - parton interactions .",
    "+ the transverse quark polarization ( transversity ) , @xmath16 , is related to the spin dependent structure function @xmath18 measured in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "unfortunately this function has no parton interpretation . for the @xmath19 polarized on mass - shell quark @xmath20 .",
    "on the other hand it looks reasonable to expect that the x - behavior of @xmath16 is similar to that of @xmath18 . note that the present data @xcite indicate the threshold like form of the function @xmath18 which becomes very small for @xmath21 .",
    "similar effect is seen in experimental data for ssa in beam fragmentation region ( see next chapters ) . therefore such effect",
    "should be included in a more precise parametrization of @xmath16 in future . since at moment",
    "the transversity can not be directly extracted from experimental data one needs the theoretical inputs . according to the non - relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) the transversity",
    "may be taken in the following way @xmath22 so the nrqm predicts distinct effects for the pion ssa .",
    "first , the sign of asymmetry is positive for @xmath23 , while it is negative for @xmath24 .",
    "second , the magnitude of asymmetry is expected to be higher for the @xmath25 , than for @xmath6 and @xmath24 .",
    "these predictions are in general compatible with experimental data , though some deviations may happen .",
    "+ another theoretical inputs can be taken from paper @xcite which aimed to explain the `` spin crisis '' by accounting the pion cloud around the proton . starting with nrqm , after account for pion loops correction one gets @xmath26=0.79 ( the sum for two u - quarks ) , and @xmath27=-0.31 corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "in such a case we can take @xmath29 and @xmath30 leading to @xmath31 comparing ( [ ansr ] ) to ( [ nrqmp ] ) one can see that the difference is essential only for @xmath24 and this fact will be taken into account at comparisons of the calculated ssa with experimental data .",
    "+ @xmath32 may depend on @xmath33 which is a feinman parameter , on @xmath12 which is a transverse momentum of pion , and on @xmath34 which is a square of the total energy in the center of mass system of colliding particles .",
    "+ the invariant differential cross section is assumed to be measured before or simultaneously with ssa .",
    "+ the general expression for weighting factor depends on the parton distribution function @xmath35 and parton fragmentation function @xmath36 ( a - parton flavor ) . assuming that the polarization information may be carried mostly through the polarized quark q and much less by gluons we get the weighting ( or asymmetry diluting ) factor through the following expression @xmath37 assuming that the main contribution comes from @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) and from @xmath40 ( for @xmath41 ) scattering via the t - channel gluon exchange between the gluon @xmath42 from unpolarized nucleon and quark @xmath43 or gluon @xmath44 from the polarized proton the contributions from quark and gluon may be written as @xmath45 where the color factors @xmath46 and @xmath47 , z is a fraction of the polarized quark momentum carried by the final hadron . + the parton and gluon distribution functions were taken in the forms",
    "@xmath48 the fragmentation functions for three types of inclusively produced pions were taken in the forms : @xmath49 the conservation of the isotopic spin and charge in parton interaction leads to the relations @xmath50 the practical applications of these relations will be given below in appropriate places .",
    "+ the weighting factor ( [ wf ] ) was calculated using the relations ( [ qgcs ] ) , ( [ pdf ] ) , and ( [ pff ] ) .",
    "the final version of function w(x ) for different pions may be approximated by @xmath51 where c is:@xmath52 for @xmath25 , @xmath53 for @xmath6 , and @xmath54 for @xmath24 .",
    "+ as it is seen from relations ( [ an ] ) and ( [ wf+-0 ] ) the analyzing power is calculated from @xmath55 without any free parameter .",
    "+ at lower energy , small @xmath12 and @xmath33 one may expect the significant contributions to the pion yields from resonance productions @xcite .",
    "therefore we arbitrary selected experimental data with @xmath56 10 gev to avoid in some extent this problem .",
    "at present we know 3 pieces of the published data on the ssa for inclusive @xmath6 production in the central region ( no data for charged pions ) .",
    "they are :    1 .",
    "inclusive ssa for reaction @xmath57 experiment e704 at fermilab measured this reaction at 200 gev / c .",
    "kinematic region : @xmath58 , @xmath59",
    "@xcite . + 2 .",
    "inclusive ssa for reaction @xmath60 experiment e704 at fermilab measured this reaction at 200 gev / c .",
    "kinematic region : @xmath58 ,  @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "inclusive ssa for reaction @xmath62 experiment proza - m at ihep , protvino , measured this reaction at 70 gev / c .",
    "kinematic region : @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "+    in following we discuss these data in listed above order .",
    "+ 1 . in e704 experiment up or down ( to the horizontal plane )",
    "polarized proton beam of 200 gev / c striked the unpolarized proton target .",
    "the inclusively produced @xmath6-s were detected by the electromagnetic calorimeters around the central region , that is , at the @xmath6 emission angle of @xmath64 in c.m.s .",
    "since the experimental invariant differential cross section , @xmath10 , is almost exponential in function of @xmath12 its slope parameter b is practically constant .",
    "for example , at 200 gev / c the slope parameter b=(4.19@xmath65 @xcite",
    ". then the quark analyzing power , @xmath66 . + according to the previous discussions ( [ nrqmp ] ) and ( [ ansr ] ) we take the transversity @xmath67 , constant factor @xmath68=0.64 ( [ wf+-0 ] ) and inserting all above relations into ( [ an ] ) we got the final result for @xmath6 asymmetry in the central region @xmath69    one can see several consequences of this formula ( [ anf ] ) .",
    "first , it is scaled on argument x= @xmath70 assuming that the slope parameter is constant .",
    "second , it becomes zero at x=0 mostly due to a quark polarization and in some extent due to the gluon contribution ( second term in denominator ) .",
    "third , when x approaches to one asymmetry increases as linear function of x. all these behaviors remind the corresponding experimental asymmetry .",
    "+ the result of the model prediction according to the formula ( [ anf ] ) is presented in fig.1 by the solid line .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the experimental data at 200 gev / c .",
    "the second group of data is relevant to the ssa in inclusive @xmath6 production by the polarized antiproton beam of 200 gev / c ( e704 experiment ) ( [ appocr ] ) @xcite .",
    "this reaction differs from ( [ ppocr ] ) by charge of quarks , that is , all quarks in polarized proton are replaced by the corresponding antiquarks in polarized antiproton .",
    "therefore the charge conservation requires the equality of the ssa s in these two reactions , namely @xmath71 as seen ( fig .",
    "1 ) this conclusion is consistent with the experimental data in frame of error bars .",
    "third piece of new data @xcite is relevant to the reaction ( [ ppt70 ] ) .",
    "the data were taken at 70 gev / c unpolarized proton beam with polarized proton target .",
    "they are presented in fig.1 with opposite sign of asymmetry ( to make a comparison to the polarized beam case ) .",
    "the expression for asymmetry at 70 gev / c deduced from the cmsm looks like @xmath72 in comparison to ( [ anf ] ) there are two changes .",
    "first is relevant to the energy difference and second- to the different slope parameters . at 70 gev / c",
    "this parameter b=@xmath73 according to @xcite .",
    "the result of calculation is presented in fig.1 by the dashed line . in this case",
    "one can see a good consistency of prediction and experimental data . in order to check the quantitative predictions of the cmsm",
    "one needs much better statistics .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath4 gev ( phenix experiment at rhic ) .",
    "at moment there are no data on the analyzing power of this reaction at @xmath4 gev . but",
    "phenix collaboration recently published the precise data on the invariant differential cross section of this reaction for @xmath75 gev / c region at pseudorapidity @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this cross section was parameterized by authors in the following form @xmath77 here @xmath78 , @xmath79=1.219 gev / c and n=9.99 .",
    "now we can calculate the slope parameter for the phenix invariant differential cross section @xmath80 it is seen from ( [ slope1 ] ) that b(@xmath12 ) decreases with growth of @xmath12 as @xmath81 and leads to the decrease of asymmetry at large transverse momentum .",
    "this trend is similar to one stemming out at the lower initial momentum ( @xmath82 200 gev / c ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 at momenta 100 and 200 gev / c was presented in the following form @xmath83 the fit to the experimental data leads to the values : @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore one can find the slope parameter @xmath86 the slope parameter at phenix ( [ slope1 ] ) decreases in the same way in function of @xmath12 as the slope parameter at around e704 energy ( [ slope2 ] ) indicating on the independence of the slope parameter from the initial energy at @xmath87=20 - 200 gev energy region .",
    "+ one can make the prediction for asymmetry in the above reaction for phenix .",
    "it seems very small , less than 1% .",
    "we hope to see soon the experimental data from rhic on @xmath88 . + concluding the discussions of the ssa in central region we note that better precisions in @xmath89 of order @xmath90 are needed for testing the cmsm .",
    "in this domain at energies @xmath91 10 gev there are the following pieces of data :    1 .   the star result on the ssa in reaction @xmath92 at @xmath87=200 gev / c . kinematic domain of measurement : @xmath93 @xcite .",

    "+ the expression for asymmetry ( [ an ] ) is still correct , as well as for the weighting factor w(x ) .",
    "the main change consists in replacing the argument x by @xmath33 , which presents now the portion of momentum acquired by hadron in the fragmentation of polarized quark .",
    "ssa may be written in the following way ( see ( [ an ] ) ) @xmath101 the factor c was defined earlier ( see([wf+-0 ] ) ) . + in order to calculate @xmath102 we must know the slope parameter b defined earlier ( [ bsl ] ) for each reaction at the appropriate kinematic domain .",
    "in following we discuss point by point the above experimental data on ssa s in the beam fragmentation region .",

    "sure the fit may be improved by adding a new parameter quadratic in @xmath12 but for our goal the linear approximation in @xmath12 is acceptable .",

    "the model prediction is simplified by using the relation ( [ pi0 ] ) which is a consequence of transformation from quarks to antiquarks . as seen from fig.2",
    "there is a good consistency of model prediction ( solid line ) with experimental data .",
    "figure 3 presents the experimental data from e704 experiment on the ssa for the inclusively produced pions at 200 gev / c in the following reactions : @xmath120    for calculation of the quark analyzing power , @xmath121 , we must estimate the slope parameters b@xmath122 for positive and b@xmath123 for negative pion productions .",
    "this task was done by using the data from paper @xcite .",
    "the invariant differential cross - section was taken at @xmath124 gev , closest to e704 data .",

    "the qualitative descriptions of the @xmath12 , @xmath33 and energy dependencies of the single spin asymmetry seem reasonable .",
    "the cmsm should be applied beyond the domain of resonance production and out of the threshold phenomena .",
    "+ to improve the model one has to use the quark and gluon distributions ( @xmath148 ) given by the global parton analysis and the fragmentation functions ( @xmath149 ) measured in @xmath150-annihilation together with the nlo expressions for the hard parton - parton scattering cross sections .",
