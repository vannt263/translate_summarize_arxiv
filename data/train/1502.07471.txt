    "the information loss problem @xcite is one of the most interesting topics to understand the theory of everything as well as the principles of quantum gravity .",
    "the information loss problem is difficult to resolve since there appears a contradiction between well - experienced principles .",
    "these contradictory principles are basically _ unitary quantum mechanics _ and _ general relativity_. there was a trial to resolve the tension between unitary quantum mechanics and general relativity , the black hole complementarity principle @xcite , though recently it was widely accepted that this principle is inconsistent @xcite and hence we have to give up one of the principles , e.g. , either unitarity or general relativity .",
    "[ [ effective - loss - of - information ] ] effective loss of information + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the theory of quantum gravity should explain the tension between unitarity and general relativity .",
    "although there are various candidates to try to resolve this trouble , one of the promising candidates is the _ effective loss of information _ @xcite .",
    "if we interpret this idea in the lorentzian signatures @xcite ( also , recently @xcite ) , there exists a _ unitary observer _ who gathers all information in the _ superspace _ ( a functional space of fields ) .",
    "this means that the unitary observer should see approximately a superposition of various semi - classical histories , including a non - trivial geometry ( so to speak @xmath0 , that describes an evaporating black hole according to hawking s calculations ) and a trivial geometry ( so to speak @xmath1 , hence no event horizon and no singularity ) .",
    "each history should be weighted by a proper probability : @xmath2 if there exists a trivial geometry among semi - classical histories , then correlations between the collapsing matter and the asymptotic infinity will be conserved following this history : @xmath3 as time goes on . on the other hand",
    ", correlations will decay to zero for the case of the non - trivial geometry that has an event horizon and a singularity : @xmath4 as time goes on .",
    "then the entire correlation function will be dominated by the trivial geometry in the end although its probability in itself is more highly suppressed than the most probable and non - trivial geometry , i.e. , @xmath5 : @xmath6 this explains the information conservation of the unitary observer @xcite . in the end",
    ", the unitary observer will see a superposition of trivial geometry and non - trivial geometry .",
    "although each history ( e.g. , @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) will satisfy the semi - classical equations , the superposed geometry ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) does not necessarily satisfy the semi - classical equations . therefore , for the unitary observer , he / she does not necessarily satisfy general relativity .",
    "this violation can be even large around the horizon scale , and hence one may see some strange behaviors around the horizon scale , where this can be named by a firewall phenomenon and the effects of the firewall should be observed by the unitary observer as expected by @xcite ; of course , it does not necessarily mean that this is a kind of barrier where a free - falling observer can not penetrate there .",
    "on the other hand , a semi - classical observer ( who lives in a specific metric ) should follow one of histories , since each history is classicalized independently .",
    "probably , the semi - classical observer will see the most probable history @xmath0 , where it will contain an evaporating black hole geometry according to well - known semi - classical quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , the semi - classical observer will see general relativity and the local quantum field theory , while also experience a violation of unitarity .",
    "this is the reason why we call this idea the effective loss of information ; information is conserved , but semi - classical observers probably can not restore information effectively .    [ [ motivations ] ] motivations + + + + + + + + + + +    this line of understanding elegantly explains the tension between unitary quantum mechanics and general relativity .",
    "however , this requires technical justifications .",
    "the critical question is as follows : _ for all gravitational collapses or formations of black objects , can there exist a trivial and classicalized geometry via non - perturbative effects ? _ regarding this question , we do not have a general proof on the existence of such non - perturbative channels for _ all _ possible gravitational collapses .",
    "however , what we can say is that , at least , for some _ special _ cases , we can explicitly construct such non - trivial and trivial geometries .",
    "one of special examples is a thin - shell collapsing bubble @xcite in anti de sitter ( ads ) background @xcite . even though we are still considering a special example , as we investigate further , we believe that we can extend to the most general case , as long as our understanding is fundamentally true .    for the thin - shell collapsing case , it clearly shows that there can exist a tunneling channel that mediates a trivial geometry .",
    "this is nothing but a tunneling from a collapsing shell to a bouncing shell .",
    "therefore , in the end , the tunneling channels are not so complicated",
    ". however , can there be any other complication of such a tunneling ? if the shell dynamics allows more tunneling channels , we may need to sum over much more divergent histories . to find a good toy model , in this paper , we consider a thin - shell ( in fact , thin - ring in @xmath8 dimensions ) that has a magnetic field on the shell , motivated from previous works in @xcite .",
    "because of fluxes , there is a competition between various factors : vacuum energy pressure , gravitational attraction , and conservation of magnetic fluxes .",
    "this will allow more complicated and rich histories , and hence this model will be an interesting toy model that realizes the effective loss of information .    [ [ contents ] ] contents + + + + + + + +    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "to realize a thin magnetic shell , we introduce a three dimensional system with a complex scalar field and a gauge field .",
    "since the system is in three dimensions , there can exist a field combination that has a constant magnetic field within a certain region .",
    "this is partly similar with a vortex @xcite , though we will consider the case when the magnetic field is confined on the shell , where this is different from the case of a vortex .",

    "if @xmath43 , then @xmath44 and hence the following is a reasonable ansatz : @xmath45 where the shell locates at @xmath46 , @xmath47 is for inside ( @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 is for outside ( @xmath50 ) the shell .",

    "especially , the first equation is simplified to @xmath64      one important point from the magnetic shell is that the relation between the tension and the pressure can be functions of @xmath31 .",

    "this is one realization of the idea so - called _ effective loss of information_. one interesting point is that , regarding our new example , there will be an infinite number of histories that contribute to unitarity .",
    "this is also worthwhile to note that the unitary observer should gather all geometries and hence the usual einstein equation can not hold for @xmath7 .",
    "this is the reason why the unitarity and general relativity seemed inconsistent according to @xcite .",

    "for both cases , they will form a singularity and an event horizon , and hence information will be lost .",

    "therefore , even though there are solutions which result information loss , after the path integral , the entire wave function will conserve information .",
    "this is a good realization of the effective loss of information .",
    "our example has some interesting properties :    * we obtained a time - like oscillating shell .",
    "this is due to the magnetic field , while the electric field @xcite or any other typical gravitational effects ( mass , vacuum energy , etc . )",
    "were difficult to allow this oscillatory shell .",
    "* the trivial geometry can tunnel to infinitely divergent histories .",
    "therefore , the unitary observer should sum over infinitely many histories .",
    "our example may imply that not only gravity , but also some special properties of gauge fields can contribute to the information loss problem .",
    "in addition , it opens a possibility that contributions from gauge fields as well as their non - perturbative effects ( vortex , magnetic monopole , etc . ) will do an important role to the information loss problem ; and these will make a complication to the entire path integral .",
    "can our result be generalized , for example , to four dimensional spacetime ? can it be applied to minkowski or de sitter background ? can there be an analogous model that can be embedded by the standard model , gut , or any other particle physics motivated models ?",
