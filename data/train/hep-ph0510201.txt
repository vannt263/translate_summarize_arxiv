    "in the standard model of elementary particles the fermion and gauge boson masses are generated due to the interaction of these particles with elementary higgs scalar bosons . despite its success",
    "there are some points in the model as , for instance , the enormous range of masses between the lightest and heaviest fermions and other peculiarities that could be better explained at a deeper level .",
    "the nature of the higgs boson is one of the most important problems in particle physics , and there are many questions that may be answered in the near future by the lhc experiments , such as : is the higgs boson , if it exists at all , elementary or composite ?",
    "what are the symmetries behind the higgs mechanism ?    among the priorities of the higgs boson search at the lhc experiments , is the measurement of its mass , width , spin and cp eigenvalues .",
    "the measurement of the higgs boson couplings and , particularly , its self - couplings will also be quite important , once they may unravel all the subtleties of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . it may be possible to measure the higgs boson self - coupling at the lhc in the case of a light higgs boson@xcite , but this will barely be possible if the boson mass is larger than @xmath1 gev .",
    "there are many variants for the higgs mechanism .",
    "our interest in this work will be focused in the models of electroweak symmetry breaking via strongly interacting theories of technicolor type @xcite . in these theories",
    "the higgs boson is a composite of the so called technifermions , and at some extent any model where the higgs boson is not an elementary field follows more or less the same ideas of the technicolor models . in extensions of the standard model the scalar self - couplings can be enhanced , like in the supersymmetric version@xcite .",
    "if the same happens in models of dynamical symmetry breaking , as far as we know , has not been investigated up to now .",
    "the beautiful characteristics of technicolor ( tc ) as well as its problems were clearly listed recently by lane@xcite .",
    "most of the technicolor problems may be related to the dynamics of the theory as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "although technicolor is a non - abelian gauge theory it is not necessarily similar to qcd , and if we can not even say that qcd is fully understood up to now , it is perfectly reasonable to realize the enormous work that is needed to abstract from the fermionic spectrum the underlying technicolor dynamics .",
    "the many attempts to build a realistic model of dynamically generated fermion masses are reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "most of the work in this area try to find the tc dynamics dealing with the particle content of the theory in order to obtain a technifermion self - energy that does not lead to phenomenological problems as in the scheme known as walking technicolor@xcite .",
    "the idea of this scheme is quite simple .",
    "first , remember that the expression for the tc self - energy is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tc condensate and @xmath4 its anomalous dimension . secondly ,",
    "depending on the behavior of the anomalous dimension we obtain different behaviors for @xmath5 .",
    "a large anomalous dimension may solve the problems in tc models . in principle we could deal with many different models , varying fermion representations and particle content , finding different expressions for @xmath5 and testing them phenomenologically , i.e. obtaining the fermion mass spectra without any conflict with experiment .",
    "usually the walking behavior is obtained only with a large number of technifermions , although there are recent proposals where the walking behavior is obtained for a very small number of fields with the introduction of technifermions in higher dimensional representations of the technicolor gauge group@xcite .    as the dynamics in models of dynamical symmetry breaking can be so different from qcd , it is interesting to investigate the behavior of the dynamical higgs boson self - coupling",
    ". it could be possible that in these models the self - coupling is enhanced and easy to measure than the standard one , even considering that the dynamical higgs boson will be heavier than @xmath1 gev .",
    "in this work we will consider a very general ansatz for the technifermion self - energy that was introduced in the ref.@xcite .",
    "this ansatz interpolates between all known forms of technifermionic self - energy .",
    "as we vary some parameters in our ansatz for the technifermionic self - energy we go from the standard operator product expansion ( ope ) behavior of the self - energy to the one predicted by the extreme limit of a walking technicolor dynamics , i. e. @xmath6 @xcite.we will discuss the general properties of the trilinear higgs coupling based on this ansatz . in principle",
    "the trilinear higgs self - coupling can be measured directly in the higgs boson pair production at the lhc via the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism . in this way we can predict the general behavior of this cross section in technicolor models . as , in non - abelian gauge theories , the fermion self - energy is related to the bethe - salpeter wave - function of the composite scalar boson @xcite , we believe that our result could also be extended to any composite higgs model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we compute the trilinear self - coupling of a composite higgs boson assuming the anzatz for the fermionic self - energy shown in ref.@xcite . in the sec .",
    "iii we review the self - couplings of the standard model fundamental higgs field and compare them with the results shown in the previous section . in the sec .",
    "iv we compute the cross section for the @xmath7 reaction in the case of the standard model and for a composite higgs boson .",
    "finally in the sec.v we draw our conclusions .",
    "using ward identities we can show the couplings of the scalar boson to fermions to be@xcite g^_a _ ( p+q , p ) = - [ fsc ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a @xmath10 matrix , and @xmath11 is a matrix of fermionic self - energies in weak - isodoublet space . as in ref.@xcite",
    "we assume that there is a scalar composite higgs boson that couples to the fermionic self - energy which is saturated by the top quark@xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume that the scalar - to - fermion coupling matrix at large momenta is given by @xmath12 , where we do not attempt to distinguish between the two fermion momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 , since , in all situations with which we will be concerned , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the coupling between a composite higgs boson with fermions at large momenta is given by _ _",
    "hff(p)g(p , p ) ~-(p^2 ) [ fh ] where @xmath16 is the fermionic self - energy .",
    "the trilinear higgs boson coupling in technicolor models will be dominated by loops of heavy fermions that couple to the scalar higgs particle as predicted by eq.([fh ] ) @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this section is to obtain an expression for the trilinear higgs boson coupling using the ansatz _",
    "a(p^2 ) ~__tc ( ) ^^- , [ sig ] which was proposed in the ref.@xcite .",
    "this choice interpolates between the standard ope result for the technifermion self - energy , which is obtained when @xmath17 , and the extreme walking technicolor solution obtained when @xmath18 @xcite , i.e. this is the case where the symmetry breaking is dominated by higher order interactions that are relevant at or above the tc scale , leading naturally to a very hard dynamics @xcite . as we have pointed out in ref . @xcite",
    "only such kind of solution is naturally capable of generating a large mass to the third fermionic generation , which has a mass limit almost saturated by the top quark mass .",
    "moreover , as also claimed in the second paper of ref.@xcite , there are other possible reasons to have @xmath19 , as the existence of an infrared fixed point and a gluon ( or technigluon ) mass scale @xcite , which , actually , are related possibilities @xcite .",
    "the yukawa top quark coupling to the higgs boson is large , no matter we are considering the composite or the fundamental standard model higgs boson , and is the one that dominates the process that we will be considering in the next sections .",
    "the main difference is that in the composite case the trilinear coupling is a function of this yukawa coupling as remarked in ref.@xcite .",
    "as considered in ref.@xcite and many others dealing with dynamical symmetry breaking models it is usually assumed that such calculations are not spoiled by higher order corrections .",
    "it is interesting that many technicolor models make use of the existence of a non - trivial fixed point ( or a quasi - conformal theory ) to cure their phenomenological problems@xcite , and exactly for this possibility brodsky has been claiming that it will be possible to built an skeleton expansion that could allow to capture the non - perturbative effects in a reliable way@xcite .    in the eq.([sig ] ) the scale , @xmath20 is related to the technicolor condensate by @xmath21 .",

    "we can determine one expression for the trilinear coupling for any theory where the higgs boson is composite by considering the diagram shown in fig.(1 ) .",

    "we will compute the twin higgs boson production with the trilinear couplings that we obtained in the previous sections , in order to verify what this process can tell to us about the structure of the technicolor theory .    in terms of the trilinear higgs coupling , @xmath78 , the elementary @xmath79 cross section at leading order",

    "the cross section contains terms proportional to @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 is the mass of the quark running in the loop ) which were expanded and only the leading term was considered .",
    "this is reasonable because the heaviest quark mass is the one of the top quark and we are considering heavier scalar masses .",
    "these equations have been numerically integrated and in the sequence we plot the cross - section as a function of the higgs boson mass .    in fig.(4 ) the curve shows the standard model prediction for higgs boson pair production .",
    "we are also pointing out four values of the cross - section for the cases of composite higgs boson that were discussed in the previous section .",

    "the higgs mass obtained in this case is @xmath103 . to compute these cross sections we used the top quark mass equal to @xmath104 .",
    "the cross section falls with increasing @xmath61 due to both the diminishing luminosity and the decrease of the phase space . according to what we commented in the end of sec.iii in the case of composite higgs boson the cross section decreases when @xmath17 ( see the arrow depicted in the fig.4 )",
    "this fact is a consequence of a combination of two effects in the cross section : decreasing of @xmath105 due to the increase in @xmath38 ( see fig.(2 ) ) , and the increase of @xmath106 .",
    "although enhancement of the signal for higgs boson pair production is possible for light standard model scalar bosons@xcite , and even in some extensions of the standard model@xcite , we do not see any possible enhancement of the trilinear self - coupling , and , consequently , of the higgs boson pair production in the case of heavy dynamically generated scalar bosons .",

    "there are possible refinements in these calculations , like the introduction of nlo corrections@xcite , which are not considered because we just want an order of magnitude estimate , therefore any refinement that may be introduced will not modify the fact that the production of heavy composite higgs bosons will have smaller rates than in the case of fundamental bosons .",
    "in this work we have presented a discussion about the general properties of the trilinear self - coupling of a composite higgs boson based on a general ansatz for the technifermion self - energy .",
    "if the higgs boson is composite we can expect it to be , at least in the most usual models , a very massive particle , @xmath108 , as in the examples of technicolor gauge groups discussed above ( @xmath71 or @xmath67 ) .",
    "we verified in the section iv , assuming in our ansatz the extreme walking technicolor limit , @xmath18 , that the cross section for higgs boson pair production depicted in the fig.(4 ) practically does not differ from the one of the fundamental standard model higgs boson .",

    "<S> we discuss the strength of the trilinear higgs boson coupling in technicolor ( or composite ) models in a model independent way . the coupling is determined as a function of a very general ansatz for the technicolor self - energy , and turns out to be equal or smaller than the one of the standard model higgs boson depending on the dynamics of the theory . with this trilinear coupling we estimate the cross section for higgs boson pair production at the lhc . </S>",
