    "in models of @xmath3 sagb stars , carbon ignites off - center , triggering a carbon flame that can in principle propagate all the way to the center , converting the core into o / ne / na @xcite .",
    "however , if mixing at convective boundaries is sufficiently effective , the carbon flame may be quenched a significant distance from the core , resulting in a hybrid c / o / ne wd ( @xcite ; ( see , however , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "these hybrid c / o / ne models consist of an unburned c / o core surrounded by a o / ne / na mantle .",
    "hybrid models have been utilized in 2d and 3d hydrodynamic codes to study the thermonuclear sne they produce and to compare synthesized light - curve and spectra to observations of peculiar sne ia @xcite .",
    "however , all of these authors assumed that the compositional structure was fixed as the wd cools . in this letter , we show that there is significant mixing between the c / o core and the overlying o / ne / na mantle .",
    "the mixing is driven by the lower electron - to - baryon ratio , @xmath0 , in the o / ne / na mantle that has been processed by carbon burning .",
    "this @xmath0 gradient corresponds to a heavy fluid on top of a light fluid and rapidly ( over @xmath4 kyrs ) becomes unstable to convection as the wd cools towards an isothermal configuration .    in  [ sec : stoich ] we discuss the nuclear reaction in carbon burning that reduces @xmath0 . in  [ sec : instability ] we derive the criterion for a @xmath0 gradient to be unstable to convection and compare to our numerical @xmath1 models .",
    "we discuss our @xmath1 models in  [ sec : models ] and explain our results in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we finish with our conclusions and implications in  [ sec : conclusions ] , highlighting that this mixing will be complete by the time any accreting wd reaches @xmath2 .",
    "material processed by carbon burning will have a lower electron - to - baryon ratio , @xmath0 .",
    "the change in @xmath0 has been previously discussed in the context of the carbon simmering phase in type ia supernova progenitors @xcite .",
    "carbon burning proceeds via @xmath5 where the numbers in parentheses are the branching fractions for the relevant temperatures @xcite .",
    "the free proton is then rapidly captured , with most captures occurring onto either @xmath6c or @xmath7na .    when the proton is captured onto @xmath6c , the reaction @xmath6c(p,@xmath8)@xmath9n",
    "is followed by the beta - decay @xmath9n(@xmath10,@xmath11)@xmath9c , which reduces the electron fraction .",
    "the @xmath9c later captures the @xmath12-particle generated from carbon - burning , @xmath9c(@xmath12,n)@xmath13o , producing a free neutron .",
    "this free neutron will capture onto @xmath6c , creating @xmath9c .",
    "thus , the net result ( approximating the branching fractions as equal ) is that for every six @xmath6c nuclei burned , one proton is converted into a neutron @xcite .",
    "however , if the proton is captured onto @xmath7na , the proton - capture reaction @xmath7na(p,@xmath12)@xmath14ne is followed only by an @xmath12-capture .",
    "since no weak reactions occur in this channel , the net result is no change in @xmath0 .",
    "the thermally - averaged cross - section for proton captures onto @xmath7na is @xmath15 times larger than that of @xmath6c ( reaclib ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the relevant densities of @xmath16 g @xmath17 ,",
    "screening effects enhance the ratio of proton capture rates relative to those of @xmath6c by a factor of @xmath18 . to demonstrate that the competition of these two proton capture channels quantitatively explains our more detailed ` mesa ` results",
    ", we use a simple model that assumes equal branching fractions in equation and assumes that when @xmath19 all protons capture on to @xmath6c and when @xmath20 all protons capture on to @xmath7na ( meaning its consumption rate exactly matches its production rate ) . for complete carbon burning , this simple model gives values for the @xmath7na abundance and total neutronization that agree with our @xmath1 models .",
    "this results in a factor of @xmath15 less neutronization than suggested by the counting arguments of @xcite , because approximately half of the protons produced in equation are captured by @xmath6c and half by @xmath7na when the burning is complete .",
    "therefore , a change in the electron - to - baryon ratio due to complete burning is @xmath21 in our models , the initial carbon mass fraction is @xmath22 and the carbon burns completely .",
    "consistent with equation  , the difference in @xmath0 between burned and unburned material is @xmath23 .",
    "the reduction in @xmath0 due to carbon burning creates a sharp @xmath0 gradient between burned and unburned material .",
    "since the ashes above are much hotter than the unburned material below , this configuration is stable against convection .",
    "however , if the flame is extinguished before reaching the center , the stabilizing thermal gradient vanishes under the action of neutrino cooling and electron conduction , while the @xmath0 gradient remains . by coincidence",
    ", the @xmath24 is the same order of magnitude as the ratio of thermal energy to the fermi energy . performing a simple buoyancy calculation by adiabatically perturbing a fluid element in an isothermal configuration of a degenerate , non - relativistic electron gas , and an ideal ion gas with average ion charge",
    "@xmath25 gives the convective instability criterion as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electron fermi energy , and @xmath8 is the adiabatic exponent .",
    "therefore , as the wd cools , the region with a @xmath0 gradient is destined to convect .",
    "a more accurate convective stability criterion can be determined from the brunt - visl  frequency , which is @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the actual and adiabatic temperature gradients with respect to the pressure , @xmath31 is the term that takes into account the effect of composition gradients ( see eq .  6 in * ? ? ?",

    "gradients steeper than equation are unstable to convection .",
    "note that the critical gradient corresponding to @xmath49 evolves as @xmath29 evolves within the wd .",
    "we use equation to compute the neutral stability lines shown in  [ sec : models ] and  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we generated models of c / o / ne hybrid wds using the published set of controls from @xcite and @xmath1 version 8118 @xcite .",
    "these models have c / o cores of mass @xmath50 and @xmath51 and total masses of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the stars producing these wds had zero - age main sequence masses of @xmath54 .",
    "the h rich envelopes are removed once the inward - moving carbon flame dies , simulating a thermally pulsing agb phase , or interaction with a binary companion .",
    "we then restart these models with all the same controls except all forms of overshooting and thermohaline mixing turned off .",
    "we started by running a @xmath1 simulation with the schwarzschild criterion for convection , which ignores compositional gradients , to show that the square of the total brunt - v@xmath55is@xmath55l@xmath55 frequency ( equation [ eq : brunt_b ] ) becomes negative as the wd cools ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the regions that become unstable to convection ( @xmath56 ) coincide with the steepest portion of the @xmath0 profile , shown by the dotted green curve in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "cooling erases the stabilizing temperature gradient , and hence mixing will begin , within a mere 1.6 kyr of the formation of the hybrid wd , as shown by the blue profile in figure [ fig:1 ] at @xmath57 .",
    "the cooling is dominated by neutrino emission until @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] highlights that the wd rapidly evolves towards convective instability , which can in principle mix material on the much shorter dynamical timescale .",
    "given that this dynamical mixing timescale is so much faster than the timescale on which the wd evolves due to cooling , we expect that convection will ( as usual ) lead to nearly zero brunt - v@xmath55is@xmath55l@xmath55 frequency .",
    "thus , for our assumed thermal evolution , we expect convection will mix the composition efficiently enough to keep the actual @xmath0 gradient extremely close to neutral stability at all times .    evolving the hybrid wd models using the standard mesa mlt implementation leads to severe numerical difficulties . when taking a timestep , as the ` mesa ` solver iterates to find the next model , some zones alternate between being convective and non - convective .",
    "this corresponds to the temperature gradient ( @xmath59 ) at cell faces switching between the adiabatic temperature gradient ( @xmath60 ) and the radiative temperature gradient ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "these are significantly different , since the temperature profile is highly stable against convection and only being destabilized by the @xmath0 gradient . as a result , the solver fails to find models that satisfy its `` ` dlntdm ` '' equation ( eq .  8 of @xcite ) . in order to circumvent this issue , we set the @xmath1 control @xmath62 , which sets @xmath59 in convective regions to @xmath61 instead of @xmath60 .",
    "the choice to set the temperature gradient to the radiative gradient in convection zones is appropriate when the convection is thermally inefficient and the energy flux is dominated by conduction .",
    "thus our choice assumes that the convection does not significantly modify the thermal evolution of the wd .",
    "` mesa ` treats mixing , including convective mixing , as a diffusive process @xcite . when using standard mlt ,",
    "` mesa ` sets the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the convective velocity and @xmath65 is the mixing length .",
    "our models consistently exhibit convective regions that span only a few cells and thus are much smaller than a pressure scale height . using a mixing length of order",
    "the pressure scale height likely overestimates the mixing , but limiting the mixing length to the size of the convective region introduces an undesired dependence of the mixing on the numerical resolution . in order to circumvent this issue",
    ", we set the diffusive mixing coefficient in convectively unstable zones to be proportional to the thermal diffusion coefficient , that is @xmath66 with @xmath67 a constant .",
    "the choice of @xmath68 as the reference diffusivity allows us to ensure that the mixing remains more rapid than the thermal evolution .",
    "physically , we expect values of @xmath69 to approach the correct answer , representing the fact that convection can mix material on timescales much shorter than the thermal timescale ( which is the timescale on which the convective regions are created ; see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we compare the resulting composition profiles for different choices of @xmath67 in figure [ fig:3 ] . while the choice of @xmath70 underestimates the mixing compared to neutral buoyancy as expressed by equation , shown by the grey curve in figure [ fig:3 ] , the choices of @xmath71 and @xmath72 yield nearly identical results and reach the neutral buoyancy condition derived in ",
    "[ sec : instability ] .",
    "this supports our claim that the @xmath0 gradients should match those of neutral stability ( eq .",
    "[ eq : new - stability ] ) , as long as the mixing timescale is shorter than the thermal timescale .",
    "we also found comparable results using alternative ways of controlling the mixing in @xmath1 , such as using a mixing length alpha parameter that varied in proportion to the thermal timescale of the wd .",
    "the rest of our results employ @xmath66 with @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the composition evolution of our @xmath1 model with an initial @xmath74 c / o core including the effects of convective mixing during the subsequent thermal evolution ( but not including thermohaline mixing ) .",
    "as the wd cools , the @xmath0 gradients ( solid lines ) become shallower and shallower , comparable to what we analytically expect given the the neutral buoyancy gradients ( dashed lines ) .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the carbon mass fractions at these same times , demonstrating that the c / o core and o / ne / na mantle rapidly mix as the wd cools .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows the @xmath6c mass fraction profiles of three models with different initial c / o core masses before any mixing ( solid curves ) , when @xmath75 ( dotted curves ) , and when @xmath76 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "all of the results discussed above are based on models run without including the effects of thermohaline mixing .",
    "as the wd evolves towards an approximately isothermal profile , mixing by convection alone would leave behind a finite @xmath0 gradient given by setting @xmath77 in equation .",
    "however , such a composition gradient is unstable to thermohaline convection .",
    "therefore , additional mixing will continue to occur .",
    "prescriptions for thermohaline mixing @xcite remain somewhat uncertain , however , leading to more substantial uncertainties in the resulting composition profile . as illustrative examples",

    "( 14 ) of @xcite , with a dimensionless , multiplicative efficiency factor of @xmath80 , which we set to 1 .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] includes the @xmath6c mass fraction profiles from all three models run with thermohaline mixing , at the time when @xmath76 ( dot - dashed lines ) . in this implementation",
    ", thermohaline mixing leads to fully mixed wds at this time , with completely flat @xmath6c mass fraction profiles .",
    "given the uncertainties in thermohaline mixing , however , the dashed ( no thermohaline mixing ) and dot - dashed ( efficient thermohaline mixing ) models in figure [ fig:5 ] likely bracket the mass fraction profiles at this time .",
    "we have shown that hybrid c / o / ne wds created from quenched carbon flames are unstable to convective mixing as the wd cools .",
    "weak reactions during carbon burning cause the o / ne ash to have a lower @xmath0 than the c / o fuel .",
    "the configuration of a heavy o / ne mantle above the cold c / o core is initially stable due to the higher temperatures of the freshly burned o / ne mantle .",
    "however , as neutrino cooling and electron conduction reduce the temperature , the hybrid configuration becomes convectively unstable .",
    "convective mixing rapidly leads to a much more uniform composition profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "our modeling choices for this initial work lead to a profile that is very nearly neutrally buoyant ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "we did not explore the physics of thermohaline convection for this neutrino - cooled material , which remains an open question .",
    "however , at a minimum , neutral buoyancy would always be reached .",
    "we also do not allow the resulting convection to modify the thermal evolution of the wd (  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "this effect may be significant at the earliest times .",
    "future work can address these questions and their impact on the compositional structure of hybrid wds .    to understand the importance of this mixing for possible type ia scenarios , it is useful to compare the mixing times to the timescales for hybrid wds to gain mass and approach the chandrasekhar mass @xmath2 .",
    "the cooling times to the central temperatures of @xmath81 , and @xmath82 shown in figures [ fig:2 ] & [ fig:4 ] are @xmath83 kyr , @xmath84 kyr , @xmath85 myr , and @xmath86 myr , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the time necessary to grow a @xmath87 wd to @xmath2 at steady h and he burning rates is approximately @xmath88 and @xmath89 myr , respectively .",
    "furthermore , this does not take into account the time between wd formation and the start of mass transfer , which is often much longer than the growth time via accretion .",
    "therefore , hybrid wds in binary scenarios are likely to be even more mixed once they reach @xmath2 .",
    "existing models of type ia sne from hybrid wds neglect this compositional mixing @xcite .",
    "if a mixed hybrid core can grow to @xmath2 , it is unclear whether its fate will be similar to that found in existing calculations of hybrid c / o / ne wd explosions as candidate progenitors of some type ia sne .",
    "when the core and mantle are fully mixed , the central carbon fraction is reduced significantly ( see figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "this implies that higher densities must be reached before carbon ignition and the subsequent carbon simmering phase can begin .",
    "the additional @xmath7na and @xmath90 mg mixed into the core will increase the amount of urca - process cooling that occurs @xcite , potentially delaying carbon ignition to yet higher densities .",
    "higher density ignition of carbon will change the nucleosynthetic signature of any resulting explosion @xcite .",
    "in addition , the higher densities required for carbon ignition at low central carbon fractions can lead to exothermic electron - capture reactions on @xmath91 mg and @xmath14ne setting in before carbon ignition densities are reached .",
    "this would give rise to qualitatively different evolution , potentially leading to accretion induced collapse of the white dwarf to a neutron star rather than a convective - core carbon burning runaway ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
