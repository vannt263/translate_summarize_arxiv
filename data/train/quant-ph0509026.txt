    "stochastic processes made their appearance in research in physics long time ago and their theory has played an important role in the description of systems which do not behave in a deterministic manner @xcite . in particular , the study of the dynamics of particles lying inside material media has been the object of  high interest .",
    "a classical example is the study of the brownian motion @xcite .",
    "a large deal of those investigations had a non - relativistic character and the random interactions with the background medium were considered as being dependent of the state of motion of the particle , that is , lacking invariance under the changes of the reference system @xcite .",
    "another large class of  studies in this field had been directed to show the equivalence with random processes of the solutions of quantum relativistic or non - relativistic equations , like the klein - gordon , dirac and schrodinger ones . @xcite .",
    "two basic additional subjects in connection with stochastic processes in quantum theory are : the attempts to derive the collapse of the wave function during measurements from the existence of random perturbations in quantum mechanics ( qm ) @xcite , and the study of the decoherence processes and their role in spontaneous transitions from pure to mixed states @xcite .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to investigate some consequences on the motion of a particle determined by the action exerted over it by a medium which random properties are defined in a relativistically invariant form .",
    "the basic motivation is simple : it is recognized that the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , is the most successful and dominant from all the existing ones .",
    "however , it is also accepted that its approach to measurements constitute one its more puzzling aspects , which up to now is widely debated in the literature@xcite .",
    "let us suppose for a moment , that in opposition to the copenhagen interpretation and in accordance with einstein expectations , the particles in nature are in fact localized at definite points of the space at any moment .",
    "then , the only way we can imagine for the quantum mechanical properties of the motion to emerge from a model , is that the action of the vacuum on the particles have a stochastic character .",
    "but , the relativistic invariance of the vacuum , leads to expect that the acceleration felt by the particle in its proper frame should be a stationary random variable as a function of the proper time .",
    "this circumstance motivates the study started here about the motion of particles inside a random media showing the above mentioned property . for the sake of simplicity",
    "the one dimensional motion is considered .",
    "it is not attempted to show the equivalence of the dynamics in the medium with the one predicted by the quantum mechanical equations .",
    "the purpose in this first step , being redundant , is to study general properties of the motion of one and two particles assuming two main conditions : a ) they have a definite localization in the space at any moment and b ) the forces acting on the particles have the above mentioned random properties which are independent the observer s inertial reference frame .",
    "the work will proceed as follows .",
    "firstly , the equations of motion of the particles under the action of the medium are formulated . for this purpose",
    "the properties which ensure the relativistic invariance of the  motion under the action of the medium are stated by specifying the form of the random forces .",
    "further , the equations of motion of a single particle are written and solved and a statistical analysis of  the random properties is done .",
    "a main conclusion following is the existence of a  conservation law for a mean drift momentum and kinetic energy of a free particle propagating in the medium .",
    "it  indicates the validity of a kind of stochastic noether theorem which links the relativist invariance of the stochastic motion with the conservation  of the mean 4-momentum of the particle .",
    "further ,  the conservation law  is studied  for the mean of the addition of two four momenta associated to the scattering of two identical particles , which repel each other through an instantaneous  coulomb interaction .",
    "it is concluded that the random action of the medium does not modify the usual conservation law , valid for the impact in the absence of external forces .",
    "a review of the results and future extensions of the work are presented in a conclusion section . some possibilities to extend the study",
    "are advanced . in general terms",
    ", our view is that the form of the analysis have the chance of being useful in the search for consistent hidden variables models .",
    "the study of these possibilities will be considered elsewhere .",
    "in this section  we will obtain and solve  the newton equation of motion for a particle on which a random force @xmath0 is  acting .  a  one dimensional system will be considered to make the discussion as simple as possible .",
    "the force will be defined as a vector in the proper reference frame of the particle and will depend on the proper time @xmath1  that means , in each instant we will consider an inertial reference frame moving relative to the observer s fixed frame ( lab frame ) with the velocity of the particle @xmath2 and having the origin of coordinates coinciding with it .  in this system of reference , after a time increment @xmath3 , it is possible to write@xmath4 where  @xmath5 is the proper mass of the particle .",
    "the particle reaches a small velocity @xmath6 relative to this system and a new velocity respect to the lab frame @xmath7 , given by the equation@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the velocity of light .",
    "thus , the variation of speed in the lab frame @xmath10 is@xmath11    from expressions ( [ fp ] ) and ( [ dif_vel ] ) the required differential equation for the motion is obtained : @xmath12    it is useful to state the relation between the strength of the force in the lab system and its proper frame counterpart , which is : @xmath13  however , since the relativistic invariance condition will be imposed on @xmath0 this will be the type of force mostly considered in what follows . integrating the equation [ dif_mov ] in the proper time it follows @xmath14 which determines the velocity the lab frame @xmath15  as a function of the proper time @xmath16 , only through the dependence of @xmath17 of the integral of the random force @xmath18 the explicit form of @xmath19  becomes @xmath20 , \\label{velocidad_en_tiempo_propio}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the medium under study will be defined in the proper frame as randomly acting  over the particle being at rest in it .",
    "that is , its action in this reference system will be given  by  a stochastic process showing no preferential spatial direction and assumed to be produced by an external relativistic system which dynamics is unaffected by the presence of the particle .",
    "its is also natural to impose the coincidence of the distribution function of the forces of the medium for a large sampling interval of proper time @xmath22  and the one obtained fixing the proper time @xmath17  produced by an ensemble of a large number of samples of the forces taken during long time intervals @xmath22 .",
    "these conditions , can be assured by a random force @xmath0 being stationary , ergodic and symmetrical distributed about the zero value of the force .",
    "a numerical realization of a band limited white noise distribution obeying these properties is implemented in reference @xcite and will be employed here .",
    "concretely , the expression for the stochastic force given in the proper reference frame as a function of the proper time will be taken in the form @xmath23 where the @xmath24  phases @xmath25 @xmath26 are randomly chosen with a uniform distribution between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the integer number @xmath24 is the number of frequency components of the numerical band limited white noise distribution .",
    "the bandwidth will be chosen as a fixed one and equal to  @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the exact randomness for an arbitrarily large time interval only will attained in the infinite limit of @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 controls the amplitude of the force values .",
    "note that the absence of a zero frequency component is implied by the condition of the process not showing a preferential direction in space .",
    "figure [ graficofuerzas1 ] shows the force distribution @xmath31 for a @xmath32 of the ensemble of forces  for @xmath33 a @xmath32 here is called the time evolution of the force , for the set of randomly fixed phases @xmath34 at the start .",
    "the picture qualitatively shows the stationary character of the random force .",
    "figure [ distribucion fuerza ] depicts an interpolation curve of the data for the distribution function @xmath35  corresponding to an ensemble of  random _ realizations _ of the force .",
    "the white noise frequency spectrum was defined by @xmath36 frequency components @xmath37  @xmath38,@xmath39 .",
    "the force amplitude fixed was as @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42  the picture corresponds to a large sampling time @xmath22 ( it is sufficient to be at most equal to the period of the smallest frequency of the spectrum ) .",
    "notice the even character of the distribution and its rapid decay to zero .",
    "of course , this occurs inside the interval defined by @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "this result is  natural due to the fact that the force is normalized and its absolute value can not exceed @xmath45 .",
    "in this section the existence of a conservation law for the mean momentum ( to be also called from now on the drift momentum ) will be shown for a particle moving in the before defined random medium .  to this purpose",
    "let us employ the solution ( [ velocidad_en_tiempo_propio ] ) which was found  in the previous section  we will combine  this expression with the results obtained from the definition of the random force ensemble  in equation ( [ fuerza_estocastica ] ) , to explicitly determine @xmath46  the resulting relation links the velocity of the particle in the lab  frame with the proper time measured by a clock fixed to it .",
    "once having @xmath47 we will comment about its stationary random behavior .",
    "the existence of a non vanishing conserved mean value of the velocity @xmath48 will be shown . starting form the method  defined above ,  the velocity distribution function will be determined for the frequency spectrum defined before and  few representative values of the arbitrary constant @xmath21 .",
    "after that , the position of the particle @xmath49 as a function of the time @xmath50  measured at the lab frame will be evaluated .",
    "taking @xmath0 to be given by the white noise force  @xmath51",
    "we have : @xmath52 then , integrating with respect to @xmath16  produces @xmath53\\text { } d\\tau,\\nonumber\\\\ &   = \\frac{f_{0}}{8\\pi}[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{i}\\sin(\\frac{8\\pi i\\text { } } { n}\\tau+\\varphi_{i } ) ] . \\label{integral_fuerza}\\ ] ]    substituting ( [ integral_fuerza ] ) into ( [ velocidad_en_tiempo_propio ] ) , gives@xmath54,\\\\ &   = c\\text { } \\tanh[\\frac{1}{m_{0}c}(\\frac{f_{0}}{8\\pi}[\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac { 1}{i}\\sin(\\frac{8\\pi i}{n}\\tau+\\varphi_{i})]+\\hat{c } ) ] .",
    "\\label{v(tao)}\\ ] ]    it can be seen that the summation within the argument of the hyperbolic tangent is symmetrically distributed  around its zero value .",
    "since the @xmath55 is an anti - symmetric function , it follows that when @xmath56 there will be a nonvanishing mean velocity of the particle in the medium .",
    "as the mean value of the kinetic energy is also conserved , it can be said that the mean 4-momentum of the particle is conserved .",
    "moreover , the relativistic invariance of the system also implies that the mean 4-momentum of the solutions for any two values of @xmath21 should be linked by certain lorentz transformation .",
    "thus , the particle trajectories for the various values of @xmath21 are simply a fixed trajectory ( in the stochastic sense ) after being lorentz transformed into certain moving frame .",
    "the picture in figure [ graficovel1 ] shows  the behavior of @xmath57 for the following values of the parameters @xmath58s@xmath59 , @xmath60 s@xmath59 , @xmath61 .",
    "note that for fixed values of @xmath21 ( that means , for certain initial conditions ) the velocity rapidly oscillates around  a value being close to the quantity @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "it illustrates the mentioned conservation of the mean drift velocity for the particle in spite of the random oscillations of the medium .",
    "figure [ graficovel2 ] shows the same dependence for specific values of @xmath21 .",
    "let us consider now the numerical evaluation of the distribution function @xmath63 ( for measuring a given value of the velocity @xmath19 ) for few representative values of @xmath21 .",
    "this function is found on the basis of the ergodic property of the system , that is , by performing  a large number of evaluations of the velocity s expression with time running from zero to a `` sampling '' value @xmath22 , for afterwards compute  the number of times , for which @xmath19  takes values in a small neighborhood of a given value .",
    "further ,  after interpolating the results , the distribution functions are obtained after dividing by the fixed size of the mentioned neighborhood .  in figure ( [ distribuciones ] )",
    "the distribution @xmath63 is plotted for a few values of @xmath21 .",
    "these pictures correspond to the frequency spectrum @xmath64 but with the amplitude fixed by @xmath65 the almost independence of the form of these curves on the size of a large `` sampling '' time @xmath66 employed ( whenever @xmath24 is sufficiently large ) indicates the approximate validity of the ergodic property of the white noise implementation employed .",
    "note the rapid decay away from the mean value and the deformation of the symmetry around it ,  of the distribution @xmath63 for different values of @xmath21 .  these distributions allow to calculate the mean velocities in each of the cases .",
    "this method will be employed in the next sections for finding the mean values as integrals over the domain of the quantity , of its value times the distribution function .",
    "it can be noted that the explicit solution for the velocity obtained in ( [ velocidad_en_tiempo_propio ] )  corresponds to this velocity in terms of the proper time @xmath16 .",
    "however , in order to integrate the velocity to find the random particle trajectories as functions of the time in the laboratory frame , it becomes necessary to know the functional relationship @xmath67 for the considered trajectory .",
    "then , let us consider now  the numerical determination of this relation",
    ". the parameters  of the random force will be @xmath68  @xmath69s@xmath70  , @xmath71 ( s@xmath70 , @xmath72  using the solution @xmath73 it follows @xmath74 and employing it , the values of @xmath75 were numerically found .",
    "afterwards , finding the inverse mapping @xmath76 , this function is depicted in figure [ tiempos ] with @xmath21 as a parameter .",
    "finding the composed function for various values of @xmath21 , the observer s time dependence of the particle velocity @xmath77  follows .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure [ velocidad de la particula libre ] , for the chosen values of @xmath21 .",
    "further , after integrating the calculated velocities with respect to @xmath78 @xmath79(starting at @xmath80  and imposing @xmath81 )  the values of the positions @xmath49 respect to the laboratory reference frame are obtained .",
    "the trajectories of the particles are shown in figure [ posicion de la particula ] , for the same set of values of @xmath82    note the randomness of the motion in the case of small absolute values of @xmath21  which is not the case for the larger ones .",
    "this property can be understood analyzing the pictures in figure ( [ velocidad de la particula libre ] ) . in the cases in which the velocity constantly changes from positive to negative values and vice versa ,",
    "the randomness is more evident .",
    "thus , the aleatory effect is more visible in one case than in the other , because the curve changes from a monotonous to non monotonous behavior .",
    "but , after taking into account the relativistic invariance of the model , as noticed before , it can be seen that the curves for different values of @xmath21 should transform any one into another by  a lorentz transformation ( exactly , when the same _ realization _ of the force is employed , or statistically , if another _",
    "realization _ is used ) .",
    "therefore , the apparent increased randomness for low @xmath21 is only a visual effect enforced by the change of sign of the velocity in frames in which its mean value is sufficiently low .",
    "let us consider in this final section the conservation of the mean total momentum of  a closed system of two particles which travel in the medium by also interacting between them .",
    "a repulsive interaction between the two identical particles @xmath41 and @xmath83 will introduced .",
    "the forces between the particles will be defined in the laboratory frame for studying the impact between them there .",
    "they will be chosen as satisfying the law of action and reaction  and having the coulomb form . if , for example , the forces have an electromagnetic origin , the retardation effects will be disregarded in order to assure that the field  will not deliver momentum to the set of two particles .",
    "this approximation is appropriate for low particle velocities in its random motion in the lab frame .",
    "the system of differential equations will be written and numerically solved .",
    "the results for the position and velocity of both particles @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , will show how after the impact , any of them deliver to the other its mean drift velocity and its type of randomness .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the expression for the repulsive force in the lab frame will have the coulomb form@xmath88    consider now the relativistic newton equations  for both particles in their respective proper frames and also the two transformations between the common laboratory time @xmath50  and the two different proper times @xmath89 and @xmath90  these relations may be written as    @xmath91    in order to be consistent with the non retarded approximation for the coulomb repulsion , as mentioned above , initial velocities for the particles  being relatively small with respect to @xmath9 were taken .",
    "this assumption makes the considered approximation to be satisfied if the intensity of the repulsive force is weak so that the velocities after the impact will also be small .",
    "employing the white noise parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93  and @xmath94 , we obtained the numerical solutions shown in figure [ choque1 ] for various initial conditions .",
    "the conservation law of the total mean momentum of the two particles can be noticed .",
    "figure [ choque2 ]  shows the time variation of the velocities of the particles .",
    "the process of exchange of their drift momenta is clearly illustrated and therefore the corresponding conservation of the total momentum .",
    "this outcome follows in spite of the strong oscillations  produced by the action of the medium , in opposition to what happens within a standard material media . in these systems",
    "the stochastic action normally tends to stop the motion of the particle making the drift velocity to vanish , assumed the absence of accelerating external fields .",
    "the calculated values for the mean velocities before and after the shock are @xmath95 which numerically confirms the conservation of the total momentum in the shock of two particles forming a closed system immersed and moving in a relativistic random medium .",
    "the one - dimensional equation of motion for a particle moving in a medium having relativistic invariant stochastic properties is formulated and numerically solved .",
    "the  velocity of the particles in the medium is a function of the proper time only through the integral of the force in the proper reference frame .",
    "this relation directly shows  the existence of a stochastic conservation law : _ a free particle in the defined random medium conserves its mean momentum and kinetic energy  along its motion . _",
    "the problem of two particles moving in the medium is also investigated after considering a momentum conserving coulomb repulsion between them .",
    "the evaluated solutions generalize the conservation law : _ the sum of the two drift momenta of two particles moving in the medium without any other external action conserves after a shock .",
    "_    an interesting outcome is that for two different shocks with identical initial conditions for both particles when they are far apart , the drift velocities before the impact are not uniquely determined by the initial conditions .",
    "these velocities also depend on the array of phases utilized for the _ realization _  of the force . _",
    "_ therefore , it follows that the  results of the impact will show a dependence on the specific _ realization _ of the random force .",
    "this circumstance implies that the probability distribution associated to an ensemble of particles all situated at the beginning at the same point and with a fixed value of the velocity ,  will not define only one direction of the trajectory for large times .",
    "the probability distributions of such an ensemble , on the other hand , should evolve in space and time  in a relativistically invariant manner , as the lorentz invariance of the system indicates .",
    "the same conclusion can be traced for any other sort of fixed boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the set of possible initial conditions for the particle ( considering also that they can be placed in the medium at different initial spacial and temporal points for the construction of the ensemble ) should be expected to be equivalent to the set of all possible space time evolving ensembles that can be observed .",
    "the above remarks suggest some possible extensions of the present work , which are described below :    * the indicated dependence of the ending results of the shocks , not only of the initial conditions , but also of the concrete _ realization _ of the random force ,  led us to think in extending the results to the 2d and 3d cases . the idea is to study the spatial and temporal behavior of the ensemble of outcomes o a series of shocks `` prepared '' with fixed initial mean velocities for both particles , and to compare the results with the corresponding predictions of the quantum scattering . *",
    "another task of interest  which is suggested by this study is to investigate the existence of preferential bounded states in the case that the coulomb interaction is considered as attractive .",
    "@xmath79a particular simpler situation could be to assume one of the particles as very massive , that is , merely acting as an attracting center .  in both cases",
    "the study could consist in determining the statistical properties of the stationary trajectories given the initial condition .     in conclusion",
    ", we would like to underline  that it seems not without sense that the realization of the above proposed  studies could be of use in the justification or search for  hidden variable approaches to quantum mechanics ( qm ) . as it can be seen from the discussion",
    ", the resulting models could not show the limitations of the bohm approach ( like the absence of predictions for the  `` guided '' motions of the particles for real wave functions , for example ) .",
    "moreover , the analysis seems of interest in seeking for a theory not requiring to fix a particular random process to each stationary state , but one in which all the statistical properties can emerge from a general framework . in the imagined outcome",
    ", the particle could propagate having a probability for transit or stay into each one of  a set of stationary random motions which could be associated ( but now within the general context ) to the particular eigenfunctions of the system .",
    "as for the allowance of the necessary  generalizations needed to make contact with reality , it can guessed that the possible generalization of the statistical noether properties ( detected in the simple model considered here ) could lead to the conservation of the  mean values for the angular momentum and other internal quantities , in analogy with the case of the linear momentum .",
    "we think these possibilities deserve further examination that will be published elsewhere .",
