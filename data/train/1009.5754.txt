    "one of the recent topics in hadron spectroscopy is to reveal the internal structure of hadrons . in particular ,",
    "hadron resonances located near two - hadron threshold are considered to be dominated by the hadronic molecule structure which is the two - hadron quasibound state driven by an inter - hadron force .",
    "for instance , the baryon resonance @xmath0 and the scalar mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be dynamically generated by the low energy @xmath3-wave chiral interaction , in the framework of the chiral unitary approach  @xcite , which also well describes many hadron resonances in a reasonable way  @xcite .",
    "it was however pointed out that certain choice of the cutoff parameter may introduce the seed of the resonance , even with the leading order chiral interaction which does not contain the pole term contributions  @xcite . to exclude such contribution from the loop function ,",
    "the natural renormalization scheme was proposed , which enables us to pin down the origin of the generated resonance qualitatively . as a next step ,",
    "it is desired to define a quantitative measure of compositeness in the chiral unitary approach . in this report",
    "we attempt to calculate the compositeness of the bound state , defined through the field renormalization constant @xmath4  @xcite , in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "we first consider the two - body scattering system with one bound state in a nonrelativistic field theory , and define the field renormalization constant following ref .",
    "we decompose the full hamiltonian @xmath5 into the free part @xmath6 and the interaction @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the hilbert space of @xmath6 consists of the bare bound state @xmath8 and the two - body scattering states labeled by their momenta as @xmath9 in the same way , the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian @xmath5 are given by the physical bound state @xmath10 with the binding energy @xmath11 and the continuum states @xmath12 as @xmath13 now we define the field renormalization constant @xmath4 as the overlap of the bare state @xmath8 and the physical bound state as @xmath14 which takes the value @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath8 is considered to be an elementary particle , @xmath4 expresses the degree of  elementarity \" of the physical bound state .",

    "the second term of this equation is a part of the integrand of eq .  .",

    "let us consider the limit @xmath24 . for small @xmath25 , the integrand in eq .",
    "is dominated by the bound state pole term and the vertex form factor can be approximated by the coupling constant @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the small binding limit , we obtain @xmath27 this is the famous result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which connects the compositeness of the bound state with the coupling constant @xmath28 and the binding energy @xmath29 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "is an approximated form valid only for the small @xmath25 , but the result is model independent because the explicit form of the interaction @xmath7 is not relevant .",
    "all the information of the interaction is embedded in the binding energy and coupling constant .",
    "in contrast , eq .   is the exact expression of @xmath16 which can be applied to the bound state with an arbitrary binding energy .",
    "the expression however include the matrix element of the interaction @xmath7 , so the result depends on the particular choice of the interaction hamiltonian . in the following ,",
    "we utilize the model - independent form of eq .   for the analysis of the bound state in the chiral unitary approach .",
    ", as in the case of chiral unitary approach .",
    "the use of the low s equation is valid when the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian span the complete and orthonormal basis , while the result of eq .",
    "can be derived without using the completeness of the full hamiltonian  @xcite . ]",
    "here we describe the same @xmath3-wave scattering system in the chiral unitary approach .",

    ". if the interaction is energy independent , this coupling constant is simply given by the derivative of the loop function , which is independent of the subtraction constant .",
