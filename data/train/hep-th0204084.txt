    "pioneered by sen  @xcite , the study of non - bps objects such as non - bps branes , brane - antibrane configurations or spacelike branes  @xcite has been attracting physical interests in string theory  @xcite .",
    "these objects are expected to be important for our understanding non - perturbative dualities beyond the bps level .",
    "moreover , they may play roles in cosmology .",
    "sen showed that classical decay of unstable d - brane in string theories produces pressure - less gas with non - zero energy density  @xcite .",
    "gibbons took into account coupling to gravitational field by adding an einstein - hilbert term to the effective action of the tachyon on a brane , and initiated a study of `` tachyon cosmology '' , cosmology driven by the tachyon rolling down to its ground state  @xcite .",
    "fairbairn and tytgat considered possibility of inflation driven by the rolling tachyon  @xcite .",
    "another subject in which branes play important roles is the brane - world scenario .",
    "actually , in this scenario a brane in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime is supposed to be our universe itself .",
    "randall and sundrum  @xcite showed that , in a @xmath4-dimensional ads background , @xmath0-dimensional newton s law of gravity can be reproduced on the world - volume of a @xmath7-brane , despite the existence of the infinite fifth dimension .",
    "there are also cosmological solutions in this scenario , in which the standard cosmology is restored at low energy , provided that a parameter representing the mass of a bulk black - hole is small enough  @xcite .",
    "there are several papers in which effects of a tachyon is discussed in the context of brane world scenarios .",
    "for example , papantonopoulos and pappa  @xcite discussed a brane world scenario with a tachyon in the bulk .",
    "alexander  @xcite and mazumdar et .",
    "@xcite considered inflation on a brane caused by higher - dimensional @xmath8-@xmath9 brane annihilation .",
    "considering that the tachyon is a degree of freedom on a brane , it is perhaps interesting to consider the brane - world scenario to take into account gravity in the tachyon cosmology . in this case , the einstein - hilbert term is introduced in the bulk action rather than in the brane action .",
    "hence , purpose of this paper is to initiate the brane - world version of the rolling tachyon cosmology .",
    "we adopt an effective field theoretical description for the tachyon and randall - sundrum type brane world scenario . after formulating basic equations ,",
    "we show that the standard cosmology with a usual scalar field can mimic the low energy behavior of the system near the tachyon ground state .",
    "an obvious consequence of this result is that if the tachyon potential has a minimum at finite distance from the maximum and if it oscillates about the minimum then the tachyon will behave like pressure - less gas .",
    "we also investigate qualitative behavior of the system beyond the low energy regime for positive , negative and vanishing @xmath0-dimensional effective cosmological constant .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tachyon ] we briefly review the effective field theoretical description for the rolling tachyon . in sec .",
    "[ sec : brane ] we consider the randall - sundrum type brane cosmology driven by the rolling tachyon and investigate the low energy behavior of the system near the tachyon ground state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] we investigate a simple double - well potential and a run - away potential to see qualitative behavior of the system beyond the vicinity of the tachyon ground state .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary of this paper .",
    "let us consider an @xmath10-brane in @xmath8-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the imbedding of the world volume of the brane can be described by the parametric equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a coordinate system in the @xmath8-dimensional bulk and @xmath13 denotes a set of @xmath14 parameters @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 will play a role of @xmath14-dimensional coordinates on the world - volume of the @xmath10-brane . throughout this paper",
    "we shall adopt the effective field theoretical description of non - bps branes proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which includes a tachyon . the effective action for the brane with the tachyon field @xmath17 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a tachyon potential , @xmath20 @xmath21 is the induced metric defined by @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the bulk metric .",
    "note that the choice of the tachyon potential @xmath19 is very important .",
    "different potentials give different dynamics of the tachyon and the brane universe .",
    "hence , if we could , we would like to use potentials predicted by rigorous calculations based on boundary string field theory or conformal field theory for configurations of our interest .",
    "as we shall see , we would like to consider potentials with a positive value at the tachyon ground state .",
    "this situation may be expected for , for example , decay of stacked @xmath24 @xmath8-branes and @xmath25 @xmath9-branes with @xmath26 .",
    "however , as far as the author knows , there is no such calculation in the literature so far .",
    "hence , in this paper we shall take an alternative approach : we shall consider very simple forms of the tachyon potential . in sec .",
    "[ sec : example ] we shall consider a simple double - well potential @xmath27 and a simple run - away potential @xmath28 to investigate qualitative behavior of the system .    the surface stress energy tensor @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 the equation of motion for the tachyon is @xmath31 -v'(t ) = 0.\\ ] ]    for a homogeneous isotropic brane , we can assume the following form of the induced metric @xmath21 and the tachyon field @xmath17 without loss of generality .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the metric of the @xmath10-dimensional constant curvature space with the curvature constant @xmath34 : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the metric of the @xmath37-dimensional unit sphere .",
    "positive , zero and negative values of @xmath34 correspond to @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . with the above form of @xmath21 and @xmath17 , the equation of motion and the surface stress energy tensor are reduced to @xmath41 @xmath42 where a dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath43 , and @xmath44 the equation of motion is formally equivalent to the conservation equation @xmath45 , or @xmath46",
    "now we consider brane cosmology driven by the rolling tachyon .",
    "we consider randall - sundrum brane world scenario on a @xmath7-brane ( @xmath47 ) in a @xmath4-dimensional bulk spacetime ( @xmath48 )  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the bulk is invariant under the @xmath49 reflection along the brane and described by @xmath4-dimensional einstein pure gravity with a negative cosmological constant and that the brane motion is described by israel s junction condition  @xcite . with these assumptions ,",
    "the bulk geometry is ads - schwarzschild spacetime  @xcite and the evolution of the brane is governed by  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath2 is the @xmath4-dimensional gravitational coupling constant , @xmath51 is the length scale of the bulk ( negative ) cosmological constant @xmath3 , and @xmath52 is the mass parameter of the bulk black hole .",
    "this equation looks very different from the standard friedmann equation in the sense that the first term in the right hand side is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "nonetheless , the standard cosmology is restored at low energy if brane tension is properly introduced  @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath54 is due to weyl tensor in the bulk  @xcite and can be understood as dark radiation  @xcite .",
    "thus , our basic equations for brane cosmology driven by the rolling tachyon are the equation of motion ( [ eqn : eom ] ) and the generalized friedmann equation ( [ eqn : gen - friedmann ] ) with @xmath55 given by ( [ eqn : rho - p ] ) .",
    "let us analyze behavior of the system near the tachyon ground state @xmath56 and show that the standard cosmology with a usual scalar field can mimic the low energy behavior of the system .",
    "for this purpose , we assume that @xmath57/v(t_0 )    \\sim lv'(t)/v(t_0 )    \\sim \\dot{t}^2    \\sim l\\ddot{t }    \\sim o(\\epsilon),\\label{eqn : assumption}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a dimensionless small parameter",
    ". the actual value of @xmath59 can be either finite or infinite . with this assumption ,",
    "the generalized friedmann equation ( [ eqn : gen - friedmann ] ) and the tachyon equation ( [ eqn : eom ] ) are reduced to @xmath60     -\\frac{k}{a^2 }   + \\frac{\\lambda_4}{3 } + \\frac{\\mu}{a^4 } + o(\\epsilon^2),\\ ] ] @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these equations are the same as the corresponding equations in the standard cosmology driven by a usual scalar field @xmath66 with the potential @xmath67 , the cosmological constant @xmath68 and the dark radiation @xmath54 , up to corrections of order @xmath69 .",
    "consistency of the above reduced equations with the assumption ( [ eqn : assumption ] ) requires that @xmath70 in particular , we need to impose a fine - tuning between the tachyon vacuum energy @xmath5 and the bulk cosmological constant @xmath3 so that the @xmath0-dimensional effective cosmological constant @xmath68 is small compared to @xmath3 .    it is easy to introduce other matter fields on the brane , following refs .  @xcite . in this case , the generalized friedmann equation ( [ eqn : gen - friedmann ] ) becomes @xmath71     -\\frac{k}{a^2 } + \\frac{\\lambda_4}{3 } + \\frac{\\mu}{a^4 } + o(\\epsilon^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is energy density of other matter fields on the brane , and the equation of motion of the tachyon is unchanged . here",
    ", we have assumed that @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the standard cosmology can mimic the low - energy behavior of the brane cosmology driven by the tachyon .",
    "it is well - known in the standard cosmology that a scalar field oscillating about a potential minimum behaves like pressure - less gas .",
    "hence , if the tachyon potential in the effective field theory has a minimum at finite distance from the maximum and if it oscillates about the minimum then the tachyon will behave like pressure - less gas .",
    "note that calculations in boundary string field theory suggest that the minimum of the tachyon potential is a finite distance away from the maximum  @xcite .",
    "it is probably worth while mentioning sen s result that decay of unstable d - branes in string theory produces pressure - less gas with non - zero energy density but that the minima must be at infinity in the effective field theory description  @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting accidental coincidence ( production of pressure - less gas ) between sen s result in conformal field theory and the above conclusion based on the effective field theory and the brane world .",
    "to see behavior of the system beyond the low energy regime satisfying ( [ eqn : assumption ] ) and ( [ eqn : consistency ] ) , we need to analyze the generalized friedmann equation ( [ eqn : gen - friedmann ] ) and the tachyon equation ( [ eqn : eom ] ) directly . in the following ,",
    "for simplicity we consider a spatially flat brane ( @xmath74 ) in the pure ads bulk ( @xmath75 ) . by introducing dimensionless quantities",
    "@xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , our basic equations in this case are written as @xmath80,\\nonumber\\\\   \\label{eqn : dx - dy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is given by @xmath84    there are the expanding branch ( @xmath85 ) and the contracting branch ( @xmath86 ) . hence , the projection to the @xmath87-plane is two - fold .",
    "hereafter , we shall consider the following three cases separately : ( i ) @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , where @xmath90 is a potential minimum ; ( ii ) @xmath91 ( @xmath6 ) ; ( iii ) @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . in the case ( i ) , expanding and contracting branches are disconnected . in the case ( ii )",
    "the two branches are connected in the @xmath94-space through the intersection of the surfaces @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the critical case ( iii )",
    ", two branches are just touching at a point @xmath97 in the @xmath94-space .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for discussion about the standard scalar field cosmology with negative potentials . )    hereafter , unless otherwise stated , we shall consider the expanding branch .",
    "the behavior of the system can be easily understood by plotting the vector field @xmath98 in the @xmath87-plane .",
    "first , let us consider the critical case ( iii ) .",
    "for a simple double - well potential @xmath99 , figure  [ fig : doublewell ] shows a plot near the minimum @xmath100 .",
    "this plot shows that the tachyon field oscillates about the minimum .",
    "since the conservation equation ( [ eqn : conservation - eq ] ) implies that expansion of the brane universe dilutes the energy density @xmath55 , the amplitude of the oscillation decays . in order to see a global picture of the vector field , it is convenient to introduce a normalized vector field ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , where @xmath103 . figure  [ fig : doublewell - norm ] shows the global picture of the normalized vector field .",
    "it is easy to see how the tachyon decays into the minimum with oscillation .",
    "hence , for the critical case ( iii ) , we may generally expect that the tachyon rolls down to the minimum of the potential , that it oscillates about the minimum with decaying amplitude and that the universe approaches to minkowski spacetime ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "next , let us consider the case ( i ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : doublewell2 ] and figure  [ fig : doublewell2-norm ] show plots for the potential @xmath105 . in this case , rolling down of the tachyon is slower than the case ( iii ) due to the larger `` cosmic friction term '' @xmath106 in ( [ eqn : dx - dy ] ) .",
    "for the same reason , decay of the oscillation about the minimum in the case ( i ) is faster than the case ( iii ) . in the case ( i )",
    "the universe approaches to de sitter spacetime ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "finally , let us consider the case ( ii ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : negative - expand ] and figure  [ fig : negative - contract ] show the expanding branch and the contracting branch , respectively , for the potential @xmath108 .",
    "these two branches are connected in the @xmath94-space through a throat . in each figure , the throat is the boundary between regions with and without arrows .",
    "hence , even if the universe was initially in the expanding branch , the system approaches to the throat and goes into the contracting branch .",
    "eventually , the universe hits a big - crunch singularity . from the previous results of the cases ( iii ) and ( i )",
    ", one might have expected that the universe would approach to anti - de sitter spacetime with the tachyon at its potential minimum . as we already saw ,",
    "the figures  [ fig : negative - expand ] and [ fig : negative - contract ] show that this is not the case .",
    "actually , the tachyon never settles down to the potential minimum in the case ( ii ) .",
    "the general qualitative behavior explained here is consistent with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the standard scalar field cosmology was analyzed , provided that @xmath109 in ref .",
    "@xcite is replaced by the @xmath0-dimensional effective cosmological constant @xmath1 .",
    "the above examples of double - well potentials have minima at finite @xmath17 .",
    "the finiteness seems consistent with the result in boundary string field theory that the minimum of the tachyon potential is a finite distance away from the maximum  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not , at least apparently , consistent with the result in conformal field theory that the tachyon evolves to the minimum without oscillation  @xcite .",
    "sen suggested that the minima must be at infinity in the effective field theory description  @xcite .",
    "hence , it may be relevant to consider not a double - well potential but a run - away potential .",
    "as a simple example , let us consider a ran - away potential @xmath110 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coshinv ] shows a plot of the vector ( @xmath111,@xmath112 ) . in order to see a global behavior of the system , figure  [ fig : coshinv - norm ] plots the normalized vector field ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , where @xmath103 . from these two figures ,",
    "it is easy to see how rolling down of the tachyon slows down .",
    "hence , we may expect inflation on the brane by the rolling tachyon , depending on the form of the potential .",
    "actually , the effective potential @xmath67 corresponding to the run - away potential @xmath110 is @xmath113 @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) , where @xmath116 , and it is known that in the standard cosmology the so called power - law inflation occurs for this potential @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated brane cosmology driven by the tachyon rolling down to its ground state .",
    "we have adopted the effective action ( [ eqn : tachyon - action ] ) for the tachyon and randall - sundrum type brane world scenario .",
    "we have shown that the standard cosmology with a usual scalar field can mimic the low energy behavior of the system near the tachyon ground state as far as the conditions ( [ eqn : assumption ] ) and ( [ eqn : consistency ] ) are satisfied .",
    "in particular , if the tachyon potential in the effective field theory has a minimum at finite distance from the maximum and if it oscillates about the minimum then the tachyon will behave like pressure - less gas .",
    "there is an interesting accidental coincidence ( production of pressure - less gas ) between sen s result in conformal field theory  @xcite and the above conclusion based on the effective field theory and the brane world .",
    "we have also analyzed qualitative behavior of the system beyond the low energy regime for a spatially flat brane in pure ads bulk .",
    "as an example we have considered a double - well potential . for the double - well potential , qualitative behavior of the system is classified by the sign of @xmath1 : ( i ) @xmath89 ; ( ii ) @xmath6 ; ( iii ) @xmath93 . in the case ( i )",
    "the tachyon rolls down the potential hill and starts oscillating about a minimum .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillation decays due to cosmic expansion and the universe approaches to de sitter spacetime . the case ( iii )",
    "is similar to the case ( i ) , but the universe approaches to minkowski spacetime . in the case ( ii ) , even if the universe was initially expanding , it starts contracting and eventually hits a big - crunch singularity . in this case",
    "the tachyon never settles down to the potential minimum .",
    "finally , we considered a run - away potential , for which the ground state is at infinity . for the run - away potential with @xmath93 ,",
    "rolling down of the tachyon slows down and power - law inflation can occur .    for future works , it is important to investigate qualitative differences among the following four simple cosmologies : ( a1 ) the standard cosmology driven by a usual canonical scalar field ; ( a2 ) the standard cosmology driven by the rolling tachyon ; ( b1 ) the brane cosmology driven by a usual canonical scalar field ; ( b2 ) the brane cosmology driven by the rolling tachyon",
    ". in particular , properties of inflation in the early universe can be very different in these scenarios .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate how these scenarios become indistinguishable from each other as the system evolves to the low energy regime .",
