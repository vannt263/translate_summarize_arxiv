    "core - collapse supernovae are among the most powerful explosions in the universe , produced when the core of a massive star is no longer able to support itself and collapses .",
    "the collapse continues until the core reaches nuclear densities at which point nuclear forces and neutron degeneracy pressure halt the collapse .",
    "the compression produces densities in excess of nuclear densities and temperatures above 10mev .",
    "although laboratory experiments such as prex @xcite might allow scientists to probe properties of the neutron , core - collapse supernova have the potential to probe the broader properties of nuclear matter at densities above nuclear .",
    "nuclear physics is at the heart of the core - collapse supernova problem .",
    "the behavior of matter at nuclear densities determines the depth of the bounce which , in turn , can alter the strength of the bounce shock causing a prompt explosion@xcite .",
    "although this prompt explosion mechanism is no longer favored , the behavior of matter at nuclear densities still plays a role in the explosion , defining the neutrino luminosity and spectra , determining the maximum compression of the core and altering the extent of the bounce shock .",
    "similarly , uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates alter both the explosive and r - process yields in supernovae .    in this paper , we review core - collapse supernovae from the point - of - view of a nuclear physics experiment . as with many laboratory experiments ,",
    "nuclear physics is only one piece of the core - collapse supernova problem ( see review by hix et al . in this issue ) , and all this physics must be understood and/or its uncertainties limited if we are to study any piece of the physics .",
    "fortunately , there are a broad set of diagnostics probing core - collapse supernovae ranging from direct probes of the core limited to only the most nearby supernovae ( neutrinos and gravitational waves ) to integrated probes that include many objects ( nucleosynthetic yields or the mass distribution of compact remnants ) . but to truly take advantage of this data , theoretical models are critical .",
    "new theory models of the progenitors , the supernova engine and its subsequent explosions have been advancing the physics and strengthening our ability to use these diagnostics to probe the physics behind core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this approach is not so different than many laboratory experiments .",
    "although experimentalists strive to design an experiment to directly observe the intended physics , most experiments are driven by a wide range of physics and theoretical models are often needed to reduce the uncertainties and interpret the results .",
    "before we discuss the diagnostics in detail , let s review the basic supernova engine mechanism and the stages at which the diagnostics help us pin down this engine .",
    "we will revisit aspects of this explosion mechanism throughout the paper as they pertain to specific diagnostic probes .",
    "the supernova progenitor , a star more massive than @xmath0 progresses through a series of burning phases , building up a dense core .",
    "for most pre - supernova progenitors , an iron core is produced that continues to grow until it can no longer support itself , collapsing to form a neutron star .",
    "some super - asymptotic giant branch stars can collapse without forming an iron core , the so - called electron capture supernovae@xcite .",
    "supernova progenitors can be observed by searching for the absence of progenitors in survey data after the supernova fades and the list of these observed stars has increased steadily over the past decade ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : progenitor ] ) .    the iron core is supported by thermal and electron degeneracy pressure . as the mass increases , the core contracts until electron capture and the dissociation of iron atoms remove both these pressure sources , causing the core to collapse .",
    "the compression accelerates the capture and dissociation , leading quickly to a runaway collapse .",
    "the collapse continues until the core reaches nuclear densities where neutron degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces halt the collapse , causing the imploding star to bounce .",
    "the bounce shock stalls and the current `` standard '' picture of supernovae argues that convective instabilities ( e.g. rayleigh - taylor@xcite , advective - vortical instabilities@xcite , or advective - acoustic@xcite ) revive the shock , driving an explosion .",
    "neutrinos emitted in the core increase during the collapse but , in the extreme densities at bounce can be trapped in the core . as the bounce shock expands , the neutrinos leak out , producing the strong burst of neutrinos and a near - direct probe of the behavior of matter at nuclear densities .",
    "the neutrino signal persists as the neutron star cools and can be further enhanced by late - time accretion ( caused as material initially swept up in the shock is unable to escape the gravitational pull of the neutron star ) onto the supernova .",
    "gravitational waves also probe this core region during the bounce and convective engine time frame , but are more sensitive mass motions caused by rotation and convection .",
    "elements are synthesized in a variety of processes : explosive nucleosynthesis as the shock moves through the silicon layer in the star causing fusion up through iron peak elements , r - process elements produced in winds from the cooling proto - neutron star or from secondary ejecta caused by accretion onto the newly formed neutron star .",
    "measuring these nucleosynthetic yields in stars or asteroids provides another clue into the supernova engine ( albeit in an integrated sense ) .",
    "as the supernova shock breaks out of the star , photons trapped in the shock are also able to leak out .",
    "this shock breakout marks the first optical emission from the supernova explosion .",
    "the shock continues to expand , producing the bright emission whose details characterize the broad range of ib , ic , iip , iin , iil , iib observed supernova classes .",
    "observations of the breakout probes the photosphere of the star , whereas the peak and late - time light curve probe both characteristics of the star ( photosphere , circumstellar medium , sometimes mass ) as well as the yield of @xmath1ni .",
    "supernova remnants , both the compact collapsed cores ( neutron stars and black holes ) and the ejecta remnants provide further diagnostics of the supernova explosion .",
    "hundreds of years after the explosion , the supernova ejecta is still visible as a remnant .",
    "the supernova ejecta - remnants provide yet further clues to the explosion asymmetry and nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "the mass distribution and spin of compact remnants ( the black hole or neutron star formed during collapse ) can also provide clues in understanding the supernova engine . in this review",
    ", we study all of these diagnostics .",
    "first , we focus on the most direct diagnostics of the nuclear physics : neutrinos ( sec.[sec : neutrinos ] ) that probe the collapsed core with the neutrinosphere touching the surface of the newly - formed neutron star and gravitational waves ( sec.[sec : gw ] ) that probe the matter motion near the proto - neutron star .",

    "[ sec : postexp ] ) .",
    "in an ideal experiment , we develop direct probes of the physics of interest ( in our case , the behavior of matter at nuclear densities ) .",
    "if no additional physics alters our probe ( or if we understand that additional physics perfectly ) , we can measure the experiment s goal physics directly .",
    "for our nuclear - physics supernova experiment , neutrinos are that direct diagnostic .",
    "the neutrinosphere , the surface of last scattering for neutrinos , occurs just above the edge of the proto - neutron star formed in the collapse of a massive star . as such",
    ", it provides a detailed probe of the conditions of the core and the behavior of matter at nuclear densities .",
    "in addition , understanding neutrino interactions themselves is an important open question in nuclear and particle physics .",

    ", such interpretations may be successful .",

    ", the peak light - curve is brighter with less energy deposition from @xmath1ni decay .",
    "this is because shock heating dominates the light curve at peak .        realizing that shock heating is an important contributor to the light - curves of many supernovae alters what we can potentially learn from these supernovae .",
    "instead of measuring the amount of @xmath1ni produced , observations of supernovae are more sensitive to , and can help constrain , the circumstellar medium . for massive stars ,",
    "the radius where the star ends is difficult to measure as the photosphere is often in the wind or other circumstellar ejecta .",
    "the supernova light - curve provides extensive information about this circumstellar medium and the winds / outbursts from stars prior to their collapse .",
    "one of the most clear - cut ways to measure this photosphere is through shock breakout .",
    "the duration and peak of the shock breakout can measure the radius of the photosphere .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : lcsb ] shows the shock breakout light - curves for a single progenitor and explosion where the mass of the hydrogen envelope has been reduced in two ways : removing the top layers of the hydrogen envelop ( in this manner , the radius decreases with the decrease in mass ) and reducing the envelope density ( in this case , the photospheric radius decreases only slightly with decreasing mass ) .",
    "the time of the shock breakout is most sensitive to the stellar radius , but the density in the giant can also alter the breakout time . without a neutrino signal , it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact explosion time , so the width of the shock breakout will play a stronger role in constraining the progenitor characteristics . as surveys begin to probe shorter and shorter transients , shock breakout observations will become increasingly common and these probes of the stellar photosphere will become strong constraints on the supernova progenitor .    post breakout supernova light - curves and spectra further probe the circumstellar medium , studying the outbursts and wind ejecta from a supernova progenitor prior to collapse .",

    "however , note that it has been argued that the mass gap could be an artifact in deriving orbital inclination angles of black hole x - ray binaries , which were used in determining the mass functions of black holes@xcite . here",
    "we review how the exact nature of this gap provides clues into the supernova engine .",
    "the observed compact remnant masses are determined by 3 factors : the mass at explosion ( depending on the explosion timescale ) , the amount of fallback after the launch of the shock ( dependent on the explosion energy and asymmetry ) , and long - term accretion from binary companions . for many cases ,",

    "the bounce shock moves out through the star until neutrino cooling , and to a lesser extent , dissociation of the infalling silicon layer , sap its energy and it stalls .",
    "the region between the proto - neutron star surface and the stalled shock is susceptible to a number of instabilities .",
    "much of the early work focused on rayleigh - taylor instabilities in this stalled shock region@xcite .",
    "if these are present , they tend to dominate .",
    "if the rayleigh - taylor instability is weak , additional instabilities can develop and dominate .",
    "early papers invoking the `` standing accretion shock instability '' focused on new instabilities , e.g. the advective - acoustic instability@xcite .",
    "the compact remnant mass distribution is able to provide insight into which instability dominates , and therefore determine the exact conditions of the explosion .",
    "the advective - acoustic instability has a growth time that is @xmath28 times longer than rayleigh - taylor .",
    "this longer growth time tends to produce delayed explosions taking @xmath29s to develop@xcite , in contrast to the 100 - 200ms explosions produced in simulations with strong rayleigh - taylor convection@xcite .",
    "measuring the delay could potentially constrain the explosion engine@xcite .",
    "the duration of the explosion is not just important in determining the neutrino signal .",
    "a sufficiently detailed neutrino signal could both measure the explosion duration and neutrino physics effects .",
    "but it is more likely that the next neutrino measurement will be pushing the limits of detectability and the signal will be limited to just a handful of detections . for this , having an alternate measurement of the delay will help us take full advantage of the neutrino signal .",
    "if we assume that the convection region dominates the explosion energy , a good estimate of the explosion energy can be made by setting the energy stored in this region when the explosion occurs and the shock is launched .",
    "this energy , in turn , depends upon the accretion rate of the infalling star onto this convective region@xcite . with these assumptions",

    "current studies argue that if a gap exists in the remnant mass distribution , delayed explosions are rare , meaning that most collapsing stars either explode quickly and strongly or fail ( or are extremely weak ) .",
    "if true , this result assures us that the neutrino signal from stellar collapse will cleanly probe nuclear and neutrino physics and not be significantly hampered by late - time explosion evolution or fallback .",
    "this picture depends both on our understanding of the observations ( which may stay have biases ) and theory .",
    "we have already discussed the observational uncertainties .",
    "an alternate way to measure compact remnant masses is through gravitational wave observations of the merger of two compact remnants .",
    "as two compact remnants merge , they produce a strong gravitational wave signal .",
    "compact mergers are expected to be the primary gravitational wave source for the advanced ligo detector with a predicted rate of a few to one hundred detections per year when the detector is at full operations@xcite . to leading order",
    ", the phasing of the gravitational wave signal from these mergers depends upon the chirp mass of the binary : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the masses of the two compact remnant masses in the binary .",
    "higher order terms in the signal rely on mass ratios and , in principle , the masses of both compact remnants could be determined from a strong gravitational wave detection . however , in practice , it is difficult to obtain exact masses with the typical signal expected with advanced ligo@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these detections should be able to provide independent information on the mass gap .    for our theoretical interpretation ,",
    "we have made a series of assumptions .",
    "first , we have assumed that the explosion energy is stored in the convective region .",
    "if another energy source , for example rotational energy in the core , can be tapped , estimates using only the energy in the convective region underestimate the total explosion energy .",
    "these additional energy sources might make it that a delayed explosion can still produce a mass gap .",
    "we will have to use other means ( supernova light curves ) to determine whether such additional energy sources are present in the explosion .",
    "other theoretical errors include our understanding of fallback .",

    "cassiopeia a also demonstrates the danger in over - interpreting the spatial distriubtion of the remnant ejecta seen in soft x - rays by chandra and xmm .",
    "until the launch of the nustar ( nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ) satellite@xcite , our view of remnants was limited to the material that is currently shocked to sufficient temperatures to be observed . for cassiopeia",
    "a , maps of this shocked gas ( figure  [ fig : nustar ] ) argued both for a highly asymmetric ( almost jet - like ) explosion where somehow the iron was mixed out extensively ( beyond the silicon layer ) .",

    "the 3 - 80kev bandwidth of nustar includes the 67.86 and 78.36 kev lines produced in the decay of @xmath33ti , producing a map of all the @xmath33ti produced in the supernova shock , not just the shocked @xmath33ti . because @xmath33ti is primarily produced with the same inner ejecta where @xmath1ni ( which decays to iron ) is produced , these direct observations of @xmath33ti provide an ideal tracers of the inner engine .",

    "the puzzle of the bizzare iron distribution in cassiopeia a was simply caused by only the shocked material . with nustar , we not only construct a picture of a `` normal '' supernova , but we might have the first real evidence that the low - mode supernova engine model ( either caused by low - mode rayleigh - taylor convection or advective - acoustic instabilities ) is behind the cassiopeia a explosion .",

    "but nearly all the data we have on supernovae used different diagnostics . in this review , we have discussed the range of diagnostics : neutrinos , gravitational waves , progenitor studies , the supernova outbursts ( a wide range of photon energies ) , compact remnant mass distributions , ejecta remnant observations , and integrated nucleosynthetic yield constraints from low - metallicity stars and meteoritics .",
    "all of these diagnostics have strengths and weaknesses , but taken together , we are at the stage of truly constraining nuclear and particle physics with our supernova `` experiment '' .",
    "some of these diagnostics require considerable theory work to interpret and any study of supernovae as physics laboratories will require a strong theoretical understanding .",
    "the wealth of data will be able to both help us understand the uncertainties in this theoretical understanding as well as provide constraints on our errors in studying nuclear physics .",
    "supernova studies are at a critical point where new surveys and new observational experiments will soon drastically increase the amount of data . along with advances in our theoretical understanding ,",
