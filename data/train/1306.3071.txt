    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite states that the gravity in an asymptotically ads spacetime is dual to a field theory which sits on the boundary of the gravity .",
    "although originally ads / cft correspondence was realized between a type iib supergravity with geometry @xmath0 and its dual field theory with @xmath1 super - yang mills on its boundary , the ads / cft correspondence has been widely extended to various general cases . for example , one can have a black hole in the bulk which is corresponding to a field theory with temperature on the boundary @xcite ; or one can work in an asymptotic lifshitz spacetime @xcite which is dual to a non - relativistic field theory , etc . in recent years , the applications of ads / cft had an overwhelming development in condensed matter physics .",
    "for instance , the holographic superconductor(superfluids ) phase transition @xcite , the holographic ( non-)fermi liquid @xcite , and holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition @xcite , etc . among these , the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was studied in an ads soliton spacetime @xcite which is dual to a confined gauge field theory with a mass gap on the boundary @xcite .",
    "this mass gap resembles the mass gap in the insulator in condensed matter physics , which is the motivation to use ads soliton as the background .",
    "the insulator / superconductor phase transition occurs at some critical chemical potential , beyond which the charged scalar will have a non - vanishing value which spontaneously breaks the u(1 ) symmetry and then induces the superconducting phenomenon .",
    "a lot of numerical methods are developed to study the applications of the ads / cft correspondence , because in this case one needs to solve the coupled equations of motions of the system , which is difficult to study by analytical methods .",
    "in particular , the shooting method @xcite is adopted to study the holographic superconductor phase transition , in which one requires the source term of the scalar field be vanishing on the boundary .",
    "however , this does not mean that the analytical methods have no roles in the holographic studies .",
    "in @xcite , the authors used the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem ( sl method for short ) to analytically study the holographic superconductor phase transition .",
    "after this , a large number of papers , for example @xcite , appeared to analytically study the holographic systems by virtue of the sl method .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite have investigated the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition by three different methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , the analytical sl method , the numerical shooting method and the quasinormal mode(qnm ) methods .",
    "they found that the final results obtained from these three methods were in good agreement with each other for finding the most stable modes ( vacuum solutions ) of the phase transition .",
    "they also studied the second stable mode and the third stable mode by virtue of the last two methods , _ viz _ , the numerical shooting method and the qnm methods .",
    "but they did not use the first method , _",
    "i.e. _ , the analytical sl method , to study the second mode of the phase transition which is the main purpose of this paper .    in this paper , we will extend our study on the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition by virtue of the analytical sl method .",
    "explicitly , we study the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition for s - wave and p - wave in the probe limit in the ads soliton background . in particular , we find that this analytical sl method can not only estimate the most stable mode of the phase transition like in @xcite , but also can be applied to estimate the second stable mode .",
    "the critical chemical potentials for the second stable mode we obtained from the analytical sl method are in good agreement with those obtained from the shooting method and qnm method in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also argue that actually one can relax the boundary conditions of the trial function @xmath2 to be only of dirichlet in some circumstances , rather than imposing both dirichlet and nuemann boundary conditions as in the previous papers @xcite .",
    "we notice that this kind of relaxation of the boundary condition for the trial function will make the estimation for the critical chemical potential more precise than before , which is first observed in this paper as far as we know .",
    "furthermore , we argue that this analytical sl method with the one parameter trial function can hardly be used to estimate the third stable mode of the phase transition , because of the conditions of the extremal values for a smooth function . therefore , this is the limitation of the analytical sl method compared to the shooting method or qnm method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we will briefly review the sturm - liouville eigenvalue problem in sec.[sec : sl ] ; in sec.[sec : swave ] we will adopt this sl method to study the s - wave insulator / superconductor phase transition , while p - wave case will be discussed in sec.[sec : pwave ] .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions will be drawn in sec.[sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider a 2nd - order homogeneous ordinary differential equation ( ode ) as , [ sleom ] ( k(x))-q(x)y(x)+(x)y(x)=0 , in which , @xmath3 $ ] . for @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "multiply @xmath6 to both sides of the above eq .",

    "will have infinite countable eigenvalues @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this means the ode will have a positive minimal eigenvalue and no maximal eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath9 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath7 are complete and orthogonal . actually , the eigenvalues @xmath7 can be obtained from the extremal values of the following reduced _ rayleigh quotient _ eq . , [ functional ] [ y(x)]=. in particular , the minimal eigenvalue @xmath10 can be obtained from the minimum value of the above functional . in the following two sections",
    ", we will adopt the functional eq . with the boundary condition eq . to estimate the critical chemical potentials for the most stable and the second stable modes of the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition .",
    "the holographic s - wave insulator / superconductor phase transition was first studied in @xcite , in which the model consists of an einstein - maxwell - scalar action with a negative cosmological constant @xmath11 .",
    "the action is s = d^5x ( ( -)+ ) , = -14f_f^-|d_|^2-m^2||^2 .",
    "where , @xmath12 is the gravitational newton constant , @xmath13 is the ricci scalar , @xmath14 while @xmath15 is the radius of the ads spacetime .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 is the u(1 ) field strength and @xmath17 is the covariant derivative . in the following",
    "we will work in the probe limit @xmath18 , which indicates that the effect of lagrangian of matter @xmath19 to the gravitation can be neglected .",
    "we will adopt the ads soliton geometry@xcite as the background , in which the line - element is [ adssoliton ] ds^2=l^2+r^2(-dt^2+dx^2+dy^2)+f(r)d^2 .",
    "where , @xmath20 .",
    "the background has a compact spatial direction with @xmath21 in order for the regularity of the geometry . for simplicity",
    ", the ads soliton geometry can be obtained from double wick rotation of the ads schwarzschild black hole@xcite , and it looks like a cigar where the tip is located at @xmath22 . from @xcite we know that ads soliton is dual to a confined gauge field theory where a mass gap exists .",
    "because of this mass gap which resembles the mass gap in the insulator in condensed matter physics , we can model the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition in ads soliton geometry . in particular , because there is no horizon in ads soliton the temperature of it is zero .    for simplicity",
    ", we will only turn on the @xmath23-component of the gauge field and assume the scalar field be real .",
    "the ansatz is a=((r ) , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0),=(r)=^*(r ) .",
    "therefore , from the above action , line - element and the ansatz , we can readily get the equations of motions ( eoms ) as : [ eompsi ] + ( + 3r)+(-+)&=&0 , + [ eomphi ] + ( + 1r)-&=&0",
    ". the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath24 and @xmath25 near @xmath26 are [ sexpansion ] & & ^(1)r^-2++^(2)r^-2-+ , + & & -r^-2 +",
    ". in which , from the dictionary of ads / cft correspondence , @xmath27 are corresponding to the condensation values of the operator @xmath28 on the boundary field theory while @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be interpreted as chemical potential and charge density of the dual field theory , respectively .",
    "we will impose all the fields be finite at the tip @xmath22 rather than the ingoing boundary conditions near the horizon in black hole geometry .",
    "there is a trivial solution @xmath31 to the above eoms and , in this case the solution of @xmath25 will be ( r)=c_1+c_2 . in order for the @xmath32 be regular at the tip @xmath33 , one should impose @xmath34 which mean @xmath35 when @xmath31 .",
    "however , there is another non - trivial solution when @xmath29 is greater than a critical value @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", @xmath24 will develop a non - vanishing value in the bulk and it will spontaneously break the u(1 ) symmetry of the gauge field and then induce the superconducting phenomenon .",
    "this is the general concept of the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition .",
    "the critical point is just an onset of the phase transition , at which the scalar field @xmath24 is very small and the gauge field @xmath25 is nearly a constant . in the following",
    ", we are going to adopt the sl method @xcite to find the critical chemical potential @xmath36 of the phase transition analytically .",
    "technically , we will set @xmath32 be a constant @xmath29 rather than a dynamical field , meanwhile @xmath24 is still a dynamical field which satisfies eq .. for convenience , in the rest parts of this section we will work in @xmath37 coordinate , then the eom of @xmath24 eq . becomes : [ psiz ] ",
    "( z)- (z)+(z)=0 .    according to the dictionary of ads / cft correspondence , the conformal dimensions of the operator dual to the scalar field @xmath24 is @xmath38 , in which @xmath39 is corresponding to operator @xmath40 while @xmath41 corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that when @xmath43 , there exist two different quantizations in the field theory which are related by a legendre transformation .",
    "explicitly , when @xmath44 the operator @xmath40 and @xmath42 are both normalizable , so we can regard each of @xmath45 or @xmath46 as the source and the other as the corresponding expectation value .",
    "however , when @xmath47 is out of this range only operator @xmath42 is normalizable while @xmath40 is non - normalizable .",
    "therefore , we will investigate the critical behaviors of the phase transitions separately with respect to different condensations of the operator @xmath28 in the following two subsections .",

    "near the infinite boundary @xmath48 , the expansion of @xmath24 can be read from eq .",

    "we have introduced a trial function @xmath2 into the expansion in order to estimate the critical value of the chemical potential of the phase transition .",
    "it is obvious that at the infinite boundary @xmath2 should satisfy @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , substituting expansion into eq . , we reach , [ feomo1 ] & & f(z)+f(z)+f(z ) + & & -f(z)=0 .",
    "+ following the steps in @xcite , we can multiply t(z)=(1-z^4 ) z^1 - 2 to both sides of eq . and write it in the standard sl method form as ( k(z))-p(z)f+q(z)^2f=0 . where , k(z)=(1-z^4 ) z^1 - 2 , p(z)=(m^2 - 4 + 8) z^3 - 2 , q(z)=z^1 - 2 .",
    "+ please note that @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfy the conditions of the sl method discussed in sec.[sec : sl ] .",

    "the results obtained from the sl method were perfectly in agreement with the numerical methods , such as the shooting method or the qnm method . besides , we argued that actually one could relax the boundary conditions of the trial function @xmath2 , depending on whether the boundary condition @xmath114 satisfied or not .",
    "if this boundary condition is automatically fulfilled by @xmath57 , we should only impose the dirichlet boundary condition of @xmath2 without the neumann boundary conditions .",
    "we made use of two examples to verify that only imposing dirichlet boundary condition of the trial function would be more precise than additionally imposing another neumann boundary condition .",
    "we believe that this kind of sl method can be readily extended to study the holographic superconductor / metal phase transition in black hole geometry .",
    "the problem of this analytical sl methods is that it could hardly find the third stable mode of the solution , like the shooting method and qnm method did in previous papers @xcite .",
    "this is because the sl method states that the eigenvalues are countably infinite and have a sequence like @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the third stable mode should have a critical value @xmath116 which is greater than the first two modes @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "but from the profiles of @xmath29 or @xmath55 , the denominator and the numerator of the _ rayleigh quotient _ are greater than zero , for @xmath4 , therefore , @xmath119 for @xmath3 $ ] . therefore , the denominator of the _ rayleigh quotient _ is always positive .",
    "this argument goes the same way to the numerator of it . ] therefore , @xmath29 is positive and analytical in @xmath61 ( please consult fig.[mucpwave ] ) .",
    "so the next extremal value of @xmath29 should be smaller than @xmath120 ( the red point ) because the function of @xmath29 is a continuous and smooth function of @xmath61 .",
    "this contradicts with the assertion in sl method that @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , the analytical sl method for introducing a trial function depending on one parameter , such as @xmath61 , can only be applied to estimate the most and second stable mode of the solution . for higher modes ,",
    "maybe one should introduce other types of the trial function depending on various parameters , or one should directly appeal to the shooting method or qnm method .",
