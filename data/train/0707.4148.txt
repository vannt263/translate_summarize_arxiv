    "we present the results of a search for the decay @xmath0 using 1.4 fb@xmath1 of the kloe data sample .",
    "this decay has never been searched before .",
    "the @xmath8 resonance is produced through e@xmath9e@xmath10 collisions at center of mass energy @xmath111020 mev . in this decay",
    "the @xmath12 pair is produced with positive charge conjugation , so that the state of the two kaons can be described as @xmath13 the signature of this decay is provided by the presence of either 2 @xmath14 or 2 @xmath15 and a low energy photon .",
    "this process has a limited phase space due to the small difference between the @xmath8 mass ( 1019.5 mev ) and the production threshold of two neutral kaons ( 995 mev ) .",
    "this results in a very narrow photon energy spectrum , ranging from 0 up to a maximum energy obtained when the two kaons are collinear and the kk invariant mass is equal to twice the kaon mass , that is ( neglecting the small @xmath8 momentum due to the e@xmath9e@xmath10 crossing angle ) : @xmath16 among the possible final states , we searched for that one where a @xmath17 pair has both @xmath14 decaying to @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to reduce the rate of the searched events of a fraction @xmath19 this decay chain is characterized by a clean signature : 2 vertices close to the interaction region , with both vertices having two tracks with opposite sign , an invariant mass equal to the kaon mass , and an invariant mass of the 2 kaons significantly lower than the @xmath8 mass .",
    "moreover , a low energy photon should be present in the event .    in the paper , we first discuss the motivations of this search , we then describe the analysis method including the montecarlo study , and we conclude by extracting the upper limit on the branching ratio and compare it with the theory expectations .",
    "the @xmath0 process was considered in the kloe proposal as a possible background source for the cp violation measurement .",
    "the conclusion was that only for branching ratios in excess of @xmath20 such a background could be critical for the measurement if no selection on the photon and on the kinematics was applied .    on the other hand the value of the branching ratio gives relevant information on the scalar mesons structure .",
    "the @xmath12 state can have scalar quantum numbers in both triplet and singlet isospin state , so that the reaction is expected to proceed mainly through the chain @xmath21 .",
    "the prediction on the branching ratio depends on the way the scalar dynamics is introduced and on the size of the couplings of the scalars to the kaons .",
    "interference effects between f@xmath22 and a@xmath22 amplitudes can also be present .",
    "theory predictions on the br(@xmath0 ) found in literature spread over several orders of magnitude .",
    "the latest evaluations essentially concentrate in the region of @xmath23 .",
    "all of them are well below the critical limit of @xmath24 so that no significant effect is expected for the cp violation studies at a @xmath8-factory .",
    "some of the reported predictions do not include explicitely the scalar mesons , but consider them as dynamically generated in the theory @xcite ; most of the theory instead includes explicitely the scalars mesons@xcite in the calculation of the br , in such a way that the predicted value depends on this modeling .",
    "for instance , the two predictions of ref.6 are evaluated assuming a 2-quark or a 4-quark struture for the scalar mesons .",
    "in such a way that the predicted value depends on the way they are treated .",
    "the two predictions differ by one order of magnitude .    in the other cases",
    "the width of the allowed band is due to the uncertainty on the coupling constants used in the parametrization of the amplitude which is extracted by experimental analysis of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the latter approach is particularly interesting , since it allows to make a global analysis of kloe data including @xmath27 and @xmath28@xcite to test consistency of the overall picture .",
    "other predictions@xcite do not include the scalars so that have to be considered as `` backgrounds '' in the search for effects due to scalars ;",
    "the kloe experiment is performed at the frascati @xmath8 factory da@xmath5ne , an @xmath2 @xmath3 collider running at @xmath29 mev ( @xmath8 mass ) .",
    "beams collide with a crossing angle of ( @xmath30 ) rad . from 2001 to 2005 , the kloe experiment has collected an integrated luminosity of  2.5 fb@xmath1    the kloe detector consists of a large - volume cylindrical drift chamber  @xcite ( 3.3  m length and 4 m diameter ) , surrounded by a sampling calorimeter  @xcite made of lead and scintillating fibres . the detector is inserted in a superconducting coil producing a solenoidal field @xmath31=0.52  t.",
    "large - angle tracks from the origin ( @xmath32 ) are reconstructed with momentum resolution @xmath33 .",
    "photon energies and times are measured by the calorimeter with resolutions @xmath34 and @xmath35 ps .",
    "the event selection performed by this analysis is based on kinematic cuts on the charged pion tracks detected by the drift chamber , and on the photon cluster identification in the calorimeter .",
    "we analysed 1.4 fb@xmath1 of data collected at the @xmath8 peak ; we also used our monte carlo ( mc ) to generate an equivalent statistics of background , which is mainly due to @xmath36 with the @xmath15 decaying close to the ip and an additional isr , fsr photon .",
    "our simulation is generated on a run - by - run basis , using as input the real data taking conditions for both detector and collider .",
    "we have also generated a mc signal sample of 10k events , to study the analysis selection efficiency .",
    "the main ingredient of this simulation is the scalar meson s invariant mass shape , which slightly depends on the scalar meson structure .",
    "we did not use any of the models quoted above , but instead relied on general assumptions of br dependence on the radiated photon s energy and on phase space . in fig.[fig:1 ] the generated invariant mass spectrum is shown .",
    "we look for two @xmath14 decaying into charged pions , by requiring the presence of two vertices close to the interaction point , inside a fiducial volume defined as a cylinder of 3 cm radius in the transverse plane , and @xmath378 cm along the beam line .",
    "each vertex should have two charged tracks attached to .",
    "for each vertex , the two track reconstructed mass , @xmath38 , is built in the pion hypothesys .",
    "for the signal , the event density in the @xmath39 , @xmath40 plane is well contained inside a circle of few mev radius around the @xmath14 mass .",
    "we require the events to satisfy a 4 mev cut on this radius . with the reconstructed masses and momenta of the two @xmath14 candidates we calculate the invariant mass of the kaon pair . as expected by the signal simulated mass spectra shown in fig.[fig:1 ] , the @xmath41 distribution peaks at 1000 mev , while the background is peaked at @xmath42 as shown in fig.[invmasskk ] .",
    "a large background reduction is obtained by rejecting events with @xmath43 1010 mev . moreover",
    ", the 4-momentum conservation in the @xmath44 decay allows to build a missing 4-momentum @xmath45 based only on track reconstructed variables .",
    "a selecion variable @xmath46 is built , which is expected to be @xmath47 0 for the signal .",
    "we retain events with @xmath48 .",
    "events that survive all these cuts are searched for the presence of one photon matching missing momentum .",
    "we require the presence of one cluster in the calorimeter not associated with any charged track .",
    "cluster s timing must be compatible with a photon coming from the interaction point , and cluster s position and energy must agree within resolution with the missing momentum .",
    "all the above mentioned cuts have been decided upon an u.l .",
    "maximization based on mc samples .",
    "we estimate an efficiency of 20.6% for the signal , while we find no event surviving in the background mc . when looking at data we observe one event .",
    "data - mc comparison is still under way , so we do not use background evaluation for this preliminary result .",
    "however we can set an upper limit based on poisson statistics without background subtraction at 90% c.l . to 3.9 events .",
    "we evaluate our b.r .",
    "upper limit in the following way : @xmath49 @xmath50 in which @xmath51 is 1.4 fb@xmath1 , the factor 1/2 accounts for the fact that we are selecting only the k@xmath52k@xmath52 combination for @xmath53 , @xmath54 is our signal efficiency the following limit on the branching ratio is obtained : @xmath55 at 90%c.l . in fig.[predictions ] our limit is compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "most of them are excluded by our result ."
