    "even if the underlying physical model is well - known , it is , in general , difficult to simulate quantum many body systems on a classical computer .",
    "the difficulty stems from the fact that the dimension of the involved hilbert space grows exponentially with the size of the system , which often renders a treatment in the full hilbert space intractable .",
    "this motivates the search for families of states that provide a good approximate description of the solution to a specific set of problems but are specified in terms of a much smaller number of parameters .    considering a one dimensional chain of spins , one such family of states is the matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "an mps ( see @xcite for a review ) with open boundary conditions is a state of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 are @xmath2 matrices , @xmath3 is a @xmath4 vector , @xmath5 is a @xmath6 vector , and @xmath7 is the state of the @xmath8th spin . the number of parameters required to specify the state scales linearly in the number of spins @xmath9 and quadratically in the virtual dimension @xmath10 .",
    "matrix product states are particularly suitable to approximate the ground state at zero temperature of hamiltonians with finite range spin - spin interactions and an energy gap between the ground state and the lowest excited state .",
    "this appears because these states fulfil the area law @xcite , which states that the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of a subchain is proportional to the number of spins at the boundary , i.e. , two in one dimension . for an mps the entropy of a subchain",
    "is limited by the logarithm of @xmath10 @xcite , and it has been shown that all states fulfilling the area law can be approximated by mps using a number of parameters that scales polynomially in the number of spins @xcite .",
    "there are , however , a number of interesting cases , where mpss either fail to approximate the solution or provide less accurate results .",
    "a particularly interesting example of the latter is critical systems , where the entanglement entropy of a subchain consisting of @xmath11 spins scales as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such systems can be approximated by mpss if the virtual dimension grows polynomially in the size of the system @xcite , and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz has also been used to investigate critical systems @xcite . to obtain states with a higher entropy than mpss",
    ", it has been proposed in @xcite to replace the finite dimensional matrices @xmath1 by infinite dimensional chiral vertex operators constructed from a conformal bosonic field @xcite .",
    "the resulting states , which are called infinite matrix product states ( imps ) because @xmath13 , are able to describe critical and noncritical systems on an equal footing .",
    "the chiral vertex operators contain a product of infinitely many normal ordered exponentials of bosonic annihilation and creation operators , where the operators in different exponentials commute because they correspond to different modes .",
    "since each of the infinitely many bosonic modes constitutes an infinite dimensional hilbert space on its own , it is , in fact , sufficient to include just one of them to obtain an imps , and the aim of the present paper is to investigate the properties of the family of states that emerge , when we keep only @xmath14 of the bosonic modes in the chiral vertex operators .",
    "we find that these states contain even more entropy than the critical imps in @xcite and exhibit long range correlations .",
    "a further motivation for investigating this family of states is that the particular construction of the states naturally suggests a way to prepare the states experimentally in which each of the spins in the chain interacts sequentially with @xmath14 or @xmath15 ancilla systems , whereafter a conditional measurement is applied to each of the ancillas .",
    "the preparation scheme is efficient ( for moderate @xmath14 ) because the required number of operations per ancilla scales linearly in @xmath9 and we find that the probability of a successful outcome is approximately of order @xmath16 for each of the conditional measurements .",
    "we note that the idea of sequential generation is in line with @xcite , where it is shown that all mpss can be generated deterministically by letting a chain of spins initially in a product state interact sequentially with an ancilla system with @xmath10 levels , and that all states prepared in this way are instances of mpss with virtual dimension @xmath10 . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that also continuous matrix product states can be generated deterministically by sequential interaction of a continuous quantum system with an ancilla .",

    "in conclusion , we have proposed and investigated the properties of a specific class of states of a one - dimensional spin chain , and we have suggested a ( probabilistic ) scheme for preparing the states experimentally , for which the required number of operations scales only polynomially with the total number of spins @xmath9 . the class of states is obtained by replacing the matrices in a matrix product state by chiral vertex operators of a bosonic conformal field theory and truncating these operators to involve only a finite number of bosonic modes . this construction is interesting , because it makes it apparent how one can generate the states by sequential interaction of the spins with an ancilla system , and because the resulting states turn out to have properties that are very different from mps and also from the critical model obtained without truncating the vertex operators .    specifically , we have found that the renyi entropy of a subchain of length @xmath11 increases significantly , when the vertex operators are truncated , and the functional dependence of the entropy on @xmath11 turns out to approximately follow a power law in @xmath59 for small @xmath14 as opposed to the logarithmic behavior observed in the critical case .",
