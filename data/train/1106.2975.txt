    "it is convenient to think of the point process in terms of the @xmath114-point intensities @xmath115_{i , j=1}^{k } = \\det\\big[k_{m , n}(z_i , z_j ) { \\mathrm e}^{-\\frac{1}{2}m[q(z_i)+q(z_j)]}\\big]_{i , j=1}^{k}.\\ ] ] we notice quickly that the intensities are unchanged if the kernel changed to @xmath116 provided that @xmath117 is measurable with @xmath118 ( we can call this a `` guage transformation '' ) .",

    "we will keep the polyanalyticity degree @xmath13 fixed in the process , while we let both @xmath132 tend to infinity .",
    "we remark here that we have noticed that tomoyuki shirai is interested in a similar model @xcite .",

    "interestingly , the microscopic behavior of the berezin measure @xmath29 is quite different for @xmath23 compared with the ginibre case @xmath22 . in terms of the blow - up berezin density ( @xmath137 here ) @xmath138 we have the following asymptotics as @xmath71 while @xmath12 : @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the ( generalized ) laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath141 with parameter @xmath70 .",
    "it is well - known that the laguerre polynomial @xmath140 has exactly @xmath141 strictly positive roots , which implies that the berezin density will exhibit a typical _ fresnel - type ring pattern_. this resembles what happens in the one - dimensional gue case , where the zero density points for the berezin density come from the zeros of the sine kernel .",
    "actually , the analogy is more than a superficial similarity .",

    "we also investigate the local behaviour of the berezin transform when @xmath28 , i.e. , when @xmath3 is on the boundary of the bulk .",
    "using the same blow - up scale as with an interior point , we show that the blow - up berezin density @xmath152 tends to a limit which can be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials ( see theorem [ thm-5.10 ] ) . here , too , there is a ring - like pattern in the interior direction , but it is not so pronounced as it is for interior points ( the bulk ) .",
    "we express the @xmath70-point intensity near a boundary point in terms of a sum of squares of hermite polynomials .",
    "the wigner semi - circle law then gives the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath70-point function , which tells us the intensity of the process .",
    "we find that for big @xmath142 , but much bigger @xmath132 with @xmath153 , the @xmath70-point function is nontrivial in the annulus @xmath154 inside it is essentially constant , and outside it more or less vanishes . near the outward boundary of the annulus at the scale @xmath143",

    "is known to be a good choice of nodes for lagrange interpolation @xcite . instead of considering points confined to a compact set",
    ", one can add a weight to prevent the points from going off to infinity .",
    "this leads to the same expression which arises in the context of random eigenvalues .",
    "we turn to the polyanalytic case .",

    "@xmath22 ( which gives the usual van der monde determinant ) , the expression @xmath166 measures how good the configuration is for lagrange interpolation by polyanalytic polynomials .",

    "<S> for integers @xmath0 , let @xmath1 denote the @xmath2-linear space of polynomials in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of degree @xmath5 in @xmath3 and of degree @xmath6 in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we supply @xmath1 with the inner product structure of @xmath7 the resulting hilbert space is denoted by @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> , it is assumed that @xmath9 is a positive real . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath10 denote the reproducing kernel of @xmath8 , and study the associated determinantal process , in the limit as @xmath11 while @xmath12 ; the number @xmath13 , the degree of polyanalyticity , is kept fixed . </S>",
    "<S> we call these processes polyanalytic ginibre ensembles , because they generalize the ginibre ensemble  the eigenvalue process of random ( normal ) matrices with gaussian weight . </S>",
    "<S> a possible interpretation is that we permit a few higher landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> we consider local blow - ups of the polyanalytic ginibre ensembles around points in the _ spectral droplet _ , which is here the closed unit disk @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain asymptotics for the blow - up process , using a blow - up to characteristic distance @xmath15 ; the typical distance is the same both for interior and for boundary points of @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to obtaining the asymptotical behavior of the generating kernel @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , the asymptotics of the @xmath17 is rather conveniently expressed in terms of the berezin measure ( and density ) @xmath18 for interior points @xmath19 , we obtain that @xmath20 in the weak - star sense , where @xmath21 denotes the unit point mass at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if we blow up to the scale of @xmath15 around @xmath3 , we get convergence to a measure which is gaussian for @xmath22 , but exhibits more complicated fresnel zone behavior for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for exterior points @xmath24 , we have instead that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the harmonic measure at @xmath3 with respect to the exterior disk @xmath27 . for boundary points , @xmath28 , the berezin measure @xmath29 converges to the unit point mass at @xmath3 , like for interior points , but the blow - up to the scale @xmath15 exhibits quite different behavior at boundary points compared with interior points . </S>",
    "<S> the fresnel - type pattern appears also for boundary points when @xmath23 , but then it is not rotationally symmetric . </S>"
