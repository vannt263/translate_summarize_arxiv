    "@xmath1  is @xmath3 , and the predicted sm branching fraction for the decay @xmath4  is @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "possible new particles contributing in higher order diagrams typically increase the branching fractions , and therefore these decay channels are sensitive to new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the branching fractions can be , however , also suppressed with respect to the sm predicted values in some regions of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "precision measurements of the branching fractions and their ratio will thus serve as a test of the sm and as a constraint of the allowed parameter space of models beyond the sm . for a recent theoretical overview on the constraints on new physics in rare b decays , see @xmath6 ref .",

    "it has recently been pointed out @xcite , that the sm prediction for the @xmath1  branching fraction becomes @xmath7 , when taking into account that the @xmath1  decays are integrated over all decay times and averaged over untagged @xmath8 decays .",

    "peaking backgrounds @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are misidentified as muons , are more important for @xmath4  because of the lower mass and smaller branching fraction , while for @xmath1  they play a minor role .",
