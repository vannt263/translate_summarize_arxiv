    "there are several conventions in the literature for comparing the fisher information content of various analyses .",
    "i roughly follow @xcite and simply compare various analyses by computing @xmath55 for a fiducial set of parameters for each analysis .",
    "i use @xmath56 , the normalization of the linear matter power spectrum today filtered in 8 @xmath57mpc spheres , and @xmath58 , the mean matter density today in units of the critical density , as the fiducial set of parameters for comparison . these fisher",
    "information estimates are not meant to be realistic survey projections , but to give a sense of how much of the total fisher information is retained by the e / b - mode statistics presented in this paper .    throughout this work",

    "the first survey has @xmath68 , typical of the des and the second has @xmath69 , typical of the lsst survey .",
    "i set the lensing shape noise per component to @xmath70 for both the des- and lsst - like surveys .",
    "in this section i study the problem of e / b - mode estimation with binned cosmic shear data in detail .",
    "i show that generally estimators which are linear combinations of the binned cosmic shear data points mix e- and b - mode signals .",
    "i then demonstrate how to define optimal estimators which minimize this e / b - mode mixing and give practical recipes for constructing and using these estimators .",
    "next i discuss other potential optimal estimator definitions , demonstrating that they are approximately equivalent to the definition used throughout this work .",
    "then i discuss how to decompose the vector space composed of the binned shear correlation functions into approximately ambiguous , e- and b - mode subspaces .",
    "finally , i compute the variance and covariance of these estimators under the assumption the shear power spectra are gaussian .      as stated above , shear correlation functions are typically measured in a bins of angle so that @xmath71 $ ] for the @xmath11th bin .",
    "additionally , for the standard shear two - point function estimator , the shear correlation function measurements are weighted by the bin weighting function @xmath10 , as in equation  ( [ eqn : xpmdef ] ) .",
    "generally these bin weighting functions are normalized to unity so that @xmath72 . throughout this work",
    "i assume the bin weighting functions are normalized properly .",
    "as detailed in appendix  [ app : srcclust ] , for pair - wise estimators of the shear correlation functions this bin weighting function is in general quite complicated because of the survey window function and source galaxy clustering .",
    "note however that for unclustered sources and neglecting the survey window function , @xmath73 , so that the dominant effect is a purely geometric weighting .",
    "this effect arises from the increase in the number of galaxy pairs due to the increase in the area in the outer part of the bin relative to the inner part .",
    "i show in appendix  [ app : srcclust ] that by using small enough bins , the effects of the source clustering can be made negligible .",
    "assessing the form and magnitude of the weightings from the survey window function is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "thus when needed , i only use the geometric weightings given above .    given the bin window functions , i now consider statistics which are general linear combinations of the shear correlation function data points described by equation  ( [ eqn : xpmlinstat ] ) .",
    "the form of these statistics has been chosen for easy comparison with work for e / b - mode statistics for unbinned shear correlation function data presented by @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize however that i have included a bin size dependent weight through the normalization of the @xmath10 in the definition of the statistics unlike @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the @xmath74 coefficients , which define the statistics @xmath16 , and the @xmath75 statistics presented in @xcite is @xmath76 for each bin @xmath11 .",
    "i will now show that _ the statistics @xmath16 always mix e- and b - mode information _ , barring a very special choice of the bin window functions @xmath10 .",
    "this derivation follows closely a derivation presented in @xcite , but accounts for the binning explicitly . in order to proceed ,",
    "i substitute the definitions of the shear correlation functions in terms of the e- and b - mode power spectra from equations ( [ eqn : xipell ] ) and ( [ eqn : ximell ] ) into the definition of @xmath16 to get the following expression for the expectation value of the statistics @xmath77 these equations with @xmath39 were presented by @xcite .",
    "the statistic @xmath78 will have no b - mode contribution if @xmath79 for all @xmath20 and thus would be an e - mode statistic .",
    "similarly , @xmath80 would be a b - mode statistic . setting @xmath79",
    ", i can integrate over @xmath20 against @xmath81 to get @xmath82 this equation must hold for arbitrary @xmath36 .",
    "now let @xmath83 $ ] . using the closure relationship for the bessel functions @xmath84 and the following result from @xcite @xmath85 i get the following expression for @xmath86 in terms of the @xmath87 @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the heaviside step function and @xmath90 is the dirac delta function .",
    "this equation is the discrete analog of the results presented in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it can be obtained by setting the quantities @xmath91 from @xcite to @xmath92 in each bin @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "originally i assumed that the @xmath15 were constants not functions of @xmath36 , but the equation derived above in general has dependence on @xmath36 .",
    "therefore generally @xmath94 will not be identically zero for all @xmath20 .",
    "the only way to ensure @xmath95 is to pick the bin window functions @xmath96 so that they exactly cancel the @xmath36 dependence in the equation above and then use this equation to compute the @xmath97 in terms of the @xmath87 . apart from this caveat ,",
    "statistics of the form @xmath16 will mix e- and b - mode information in general .",
    "this mixing arises directly from the binning and is a general feature of e / b - mode separation with pixelized data as well ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results have important implications for the theoretical analysis of binned cosmic shear correlation function data . for binned shear correlation functions with @xmath9 bins",
    ", it would be nice to divide the space of the 2@xmath9 data points into pure e - mode , pure b - mode , and ambiguous modes , similar to the decomposition achieved by @xcite with the cosebi statistics over the continuous function space of the shear correlation functions .",
    "however , i have shown that for general window functions @xmath10 , this decomposition is impossible because there do not exist pure e- and b - mode linear combinations . in the next section , i will define approximately pure e- and b - mode linear combinations , along with approximately ambiguous modes .",
    "thus i will show that there does in fact exist a division of the space of @xmath98 data points into _ approximately _ ambiguous , e- and b - mode subspaces .",
    "this approximate decomposition is explored fully in section  [ sec : ebmodedec ] .",
    "these results are also quite useful for cosmic shear data analysis .",
    "suppose one did in fact use a statistic which is a linear combination of the shear correlation function data points .",
    "then from equations ( [ eqn : xipmell ] ) and ( [ eqn : wpmdef ] ) one can compute how the statistic mixes e- and b - modes due to the binning .",
    "additionally as i will show below , as the shear correlation function bins are made smaller , the magnitude of @xmath94 will decrease , so that the e / b - mode mixing decreases as well . if the bins are made small enough , the bias in @xmath80 , the b - mode statistic , due to e / b - mode mixing , can be made smaller than the statistical errors . thus these results give a quantitative criterion by which to decide the number and size of the bins used to compute the shear correlation functions .",
    "finally , equation ( [ eqn : fmnobin ] ) suggests two ways to minimize the e / b - mode mixing .",
    "the first is to reweight the data in each bin by choosing the @xmath96 to cancel the @xmath36 dependence in equation  ( [ eqn : fmnobin ] ) and then use this equation to compute the @xmath97 .",
    "i will not consider this possibility here .",
    "the second is to pick the @xmath97 in order to minimize the e / b - mode mixing without adjusting the bin window functions . given a fiducial choice for the @xmath87 , one can define @xmath97 in some way ( roughly similar to equation  ( [ eqn : fmnobin ] ) ) in order to minimize the mode mixing by minimizing @xmath94 .",
    "the details of this definition along with a general procedure for computing the @xmath15 are described in the next section .",
    "consider now binned shear correlation function data over the range @xmath2 $ ] in angle with @xmath9 bins .",
    "each bin is described by the bin window functions introduced above so that the bins cover the range @xmath2 $ ] without any overlaps between the ranges of each bin , @xmath93 $ ] . in order to define the @xmath86 ,",
    "i minimize the square amplitude of the window function @xmath94 with respect to the coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath99\\ .\\ ] ] the solution to this equation is @xmath100 this solution is equivalent to multiplying equation  ( [ eqn : fmnobin ] ) by @xmath101 and then integrating over @xmath36 with the weight @xmath102 .",
    "similarly to the unbinned estimators described in @xcite , the binned estimators described in this work must satisfy two integral constraints in order to be non - zero only over a finite range in angle .",
    "these constraints can be understood as follows .",
    "suppose that the @xmath87 are non - zero only in the interval @xmath103 $ ] contained in @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "now consider @xmath104 .",
    "then according to equation  ( [ eqn : fmdef ] ) , the @xmath97 will be non - zero in the interval @xmath103 $ ] only if the @xmath87 satisfy the following constraints @xmath105}f_{+i}\\int_{l_{i}}^{h_{i}}d\\theta\\,w_{i}(\\theta)\\label{eqn : sumconta}\\\\ 0 & = & \\sum_{\\theta_{i}\\in[l_{s},h_{s}]}f_{+i}\\int_{l_{i}}^{h_{i}}d\\theta\\,w_{i}(\\theta)\\,\\theta^{2}\\label{eqn : sumcontb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sums run only over bins in the interval @xmath103 $ ] . given data in some fiducial angular interval , one can always increase the angular range considered as long as the @xmath15 are zero outside the fiducial angular range . thus in order for the @xmath16 statistics to self - consistently consider only data in a finite angular range and minimize e / b - mode mixing by minimizing @xmath94 , they must satisfy the constraints given above .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "these constraints serve to project out ambiguous modes in the continuous correlation functions @xmath32 which can not be uniquely classified as either e- or b - modes .",
    "these modes are @xmath106 and so these constraints simply project out the binned versions of these modes . barring the caveat discussed above , in the discrete case no modes can be uniquely classified as pure e- or b - modes .",
    "thus in this sense all modes are ambiguous in the discrete case , due to the binning .",
    "however , e / b - mode separation for the discrete modes along @xmath106 is not possible even in the limit of infinitely small bins , so these discrete modes are the analogues of the ambiguous continuous modes .",
    "importantly , these ambiguous modes can still potentially carry cosmological information , it is just that one can not uniquely determine if the modes are sourced by the e- or b - mode power spectrum .",
    "assuming one has determined that the cosmic shear data is free of systematic contamination , it may be advantageous to keep and use the information in the ambiguous modes ( see @xcite for a similar point in the context of the pseudo-@xmath107 formalism and also @xcite ) .",
    "this point is illustrated below with a simple fisher information analysis .",
    "given the linear relation between the @xmath15 and the linear constraints on the @xmath87 , it is natural to treat them as vectors of length @xmath9 .",
    "thus the two integral constraints in equations  ( [ eqn : sumconta ] ) and ( [ eqn : sumcontb ] ) mean that the @xmath108 vector can not have any component along the directions @xmath109 similarly , equation  ( [ eqn : fmdef ] ) defines a matrix , which i will denote as @xmath110 , which relates the @xmath108 to the @xmath111 via @xmath112 .",
    "i give explicit forms for these quantities assuming geometric bin weightings in appendix  [ app : estgeomwgt ] .",
    "the overall process to create a set of @xmath108 and @xmath111 vectors and measure the e- and b - mode signals in this scheme is quite straight forward .    1 .",
    "choose an initial shape for the @xmath108 vector .",
    "usually one has some external motivation for this choice , like for example , statistics which form a complete set of functions and exhibit efficient data compression @xcite , statistics that are compact and non - oscillatory in fourier space @xcite , or statistics which maximize the signal - to - noise in the measurement of cosmological parameters , like @xmath56 or @xmath58 @xcite .",

    "one simply uses @xmath113 and @xmath114 first in the gram - schmidt process , followed by the rest of the initial estimator shapes for @xmath108 .",

    "the first two elements of this basis span the space generated by the constraint directions @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the @xmath111 filters are again obtained from the matrix defined in equation ( [ eqn : fmdef ] ) .      in this section",
    "i will explore two other potential optimal estimators definitions .",
    "the first definition simply consists of swapping the roles of @xmath108 and @xmath111 in the previous section .",
    "thus in this scheme the optimal estimator is now defined by @xmath120\\ .\\ ] ] the full estimators for this case are presented in appendix  [ app : fminusest ] . in this case , all of the same results presented above hold and in particular there exists a matrix @xmath121 which defines the @xmath108 in terms of the @xmath111 via @xmath122 .",
    "there also exist ambiguous modes , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , in analogy to the ones defined above .",
    "finally , the procedure just given for e / b - mode separation can be carried out in exactly the same way as described above by first defining fiducial @xmath111 filters , projecting out the @xmath123 and @xmath124 modes , computing the @xmath108 filters from the matrix @xmath121 , and then computing @xmath16 .",
    "the second potential optimal estimator definition consists of minimizing the power in the @xmath94 window function by varying both @xmath108 and @xmath111 simultaneously .",
    "the two equations that must be solved for this kind of estimator are @xmath125\\nonumber\\\\ 0 & = & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial f_{+k}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\ell\\,\\ell|w_{-}(\\ell)|^{2}\\right]\\nonumber\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the results for the two optimal estimators already presented , the two equations the @xmath74 vectors must satisfy are @xmath126 combing these two relations one gets that the optimal @xmath108 and @xmath111 vectors computed in this way must satisfy @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the identity matrix .",
    "thus in this case the @xmath74 vectors must be in the null space or kernels of the matrices @xmath129 .",
    "a straight forward way to investigate the kernels of these matrices is via computing their singular value decomposition ( svd ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the svd of a matrix @xmath130 is defined as @xmath131 . here",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 are orthogonal matrices , assuming @xmath130 is real , and @xmath134 is a diagonal matrix with the singular values along the diagonal .",
    "one can show that a basis for the kernel of a square matrix can be found by using all of the columns of @xmath133 which have zero singular values in @xmath134 .",
    "similar results hold for non - square matrices but they are of no use here .",
    "additionally , the rank of the matrix is number of non - zero singular values so that a square matrix with all non - zero singular values has full rank and is invertible .    using logarithmic binning and the geometric bin weighting @xmath10",
    ", i find that the matrix @xmath135 has two large singular values which exceed all of the others by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the @xmath119 other singular values are of similar magnitude to each other , but much smaller than the largest two .",
    "the difference between the two largest and the other @xmath119 singular values increases as the number of bins is increased in a fixed angular range . also , the columns of @xmath133 along the two largest singular values are approximately along the ambiguous directions @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "analogous properties hold for the singular values of the matrix @xmath136 and the ambiguous directions @xmath123 and @xmath124 . unfortunately , all of the singular values of these matrices are non - zero so that no vector except the zero vector lies in their null spaces .",
    "note that one must be careful to account for rounding errors when considering whether or not singular values are zero .",
    "i find however that the @xmath119 smaller singular values are well above rounding errors .",
    "thus optimal estimators defined by varying both the @xmath108 and @xmath111 coefficients simultaneously do not exist in this case .",
    "however , this analysis does provide useful insight into the relationship between the estimators defined by varying @xmath111 and those defined by varying the @xmath108 coefficients .",
    "in particular , given that the singular values along the directions orthogonal to the ambiguous directions @xmath137 and @xmath138 are very small , we have that @xmath108 and @xmath111 vectors orthogonal to these directions span subspaces which are close to being kernels of the matrices @xmath129 .",
    "thus @xmath139 one can verify this property empirically as well .",
    "therefore the matrix @xmath110 generates @xmath111 vectors which are approximately in the approximate null space of @xmath136 and vice versa .",
    "( to see this , simply multiply the two equations above by @xmath110 and @xmath121 respectively and use the relationship @xmath140 . )",
    "thus @xmath111 vectors generated from @xmath108 vectors are very close to being orthogonal to the constraint directions @xmath138 .",
    "the analogous property holds for @xmath108 vectors generated from @xmath111 vectors and the constraint directions @xmath137 .",
    "additionally , due to these approximate equalities , the operation of `` composing '' the two different estimator definitions approximately returns the identity .",
    "in other words , one can first compute optimal estimators by varying the @xmath111 and supplying fiducial guesses for the @xmath108 .",
    "then the computed @xmath111 vectors can be used to supply fiducial guesses for the set of optimal estimators defined by varying the @xmath108 .",
    "the new set of estimators that result from varying the @xmath108 will be very close to the first set of estimators defined by varying the @xmath111 .",
    "this fact can be verified empirically . in this sense ,",
    "the two optimal estimator definitions are consistent .",
    "it is now straight forward to build the approximate decomposition of the space of @xmath98 data points into e - mode , b - mode , and ambiguous modes discussed above . to do this properly",
    ", i must specify a basis for the vector space of @xmath98 data points which can be divided into directions approximately along ambiguous , e- and b - modes .",
    "the subspaces spanned by each of these three sets of modes need not be mutually orthogonal , though in practice the e- and b - mode subspaces are approximately orthogonal to the ambiguous mode subspace defined below .",
    "first , i specify the basis vectors for the ambiguous directions .",
    "these vectors are @xmath141 where the @xmath142 are zero vectors of length @xmath9 .",
    "next i specify the e- and b - mode directions .",
    "this is done by building a set of @xmath119 e- and b - mode estimators from a set of @xmath119 @xmath108 vectors .",
    "additionally these @xmath119 @xmath108 vectors together with @xmath113 and @xmath114 should form a basis for the @xmath46 subspace of the total vector space composed of both @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the construction of the optimal estimators enforces that the @xmath119 @xmath108 vectors are exactly orthogonal to the @xmath113 and @xmath114 vectors . additionally ,",
    "as shown above , the resulting @xmath111 vectors will be approximately orthogonal to the @xmath123 and @xmath124 vectors .",
    "so using the @xmath119 @xmath108 vectors along with their @xmath111 counterparts , one can define the final @xmath143 potential basis vectors of this space as @xmath144 where this construction is repeated for each of the @xmath119 @xmath108 vectors .",
    "the first of these vectors is simply the direction of @xmath78 and the second is in the direction of @xmath80 so that they are approximate e- and b - mode directions .",
    "finally , one must verify that this set of vectors combined with the ambiguous mode directions is in fact a basis for the vectors space of dimension @xmath98 by , for example , determining the rank of the matrix composed of these vectors as rows .",
    "note that this construction would work just as well by first building a basis with the @xmath111 vectors and the @xmath138 vectors , and then computing the @xmath108 vectors .",
    "below , i will investigate this construction for the cosebi - like @xcite basis vectors defined in section  [ sec : cosebi ] .",
    "finally , it is important to note that the exact properties of the matrices @xmath145 influence the properties of the basis constructed above nontrivially .",
    "specifically , if one uses the equal area binning ( i.e. @xmath146 is the same for all bins @xmath11 ) , then one can show using the expressions for these matrices given in appendices  [ app : estgeomwgt ] and [ app : fminusest ] for geometric binning functions that @xmath147 .",
    "thus for vectors along the @xmath74 directions , the matrices @xmath145 in this case are approximately orthogonal .",
    "a quick calculation shows that if these matrices were exactly orthogonal and one started out with an orthonormal basis for the @xmath46 subspace , then then the @xmath111 vectors would also be orthonormal . in this case",
    "the e- and b - mode subspaces would then be exactly mutually orthogonal . in practice",
    "this exact orthogonality is not realized , but the e- and b - mode subspaces do retain some degree of orthogonality even for logarithmic binning for the cosebi - like statistics described below in section  [ sec : cosebi ] .      with equation  ( [ eqn : xipmell ] )",
    "it is possible to compute the covariance of these statistics .",
    "i follow the same method outlined in @xcite and get , assuming that the eb cross - power @xmath148 is zero and the power spectra are gaussian , @xmath149\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath150\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath151\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these expressions reduce to those in @xcite when @xmath152 .",
    "also note that the squared amplitude of the @xmath94 window function controls the amount of excess variance in the e- and b - mode statistics due to e / b - mode mixing .",
    "the procedure for defining @xmath111 introduced above serves to minimize this excess variance .",
    "similarly , by minimizing @xmath94 , the covariance between the e- and b - mode statistics is minimized .",
    "in this section , i will illustrate the ideas discussed above by constructing and evaluating the performance of two different e / b - mode statistics .",
    "i first present cosebi - like ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sek10 ) statistics in section  [ sec : cosebi ]",
    ". these statistics have @xmath153 data compression ratios for upcoming surveys which can greatly simply data analysis . using these estimators i will also evaluate the level of e / b - mode mixing as function of the number of shear correlation function bins . then i present wavelet - like b - mode statistics which allow one to determine the scale and location of b - mode contamination in shear correlation function data in section  [ sec : wvstats ] . finally in section  [ sec : fishinfo ] , i explore the properties of the approximate ambiguous , e- and b - mode decomposition discussed above and the fisher information content of these subspaces using the coseb - like statistics .      as demonstrated in sek10 , filter functions which are polynomials in @xmath154 have very optimal data compression ratios .",
    "additionally , sek10 built a set of filter functions which are orthonormal over a finite interval ( using a slightly different definition of orthonormality than the vector inner product used above ) . in order to generate a similar set of filters for correlation functions measured with @xmath9 bins ,",
    "i take as an initial shape for the @xmath108 filters , @xmath155 $ ] , where @xmath156 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath20 and @xmath157 is simply the logarithm of the angle @xmath158 remapped to the appropriate interval , @xmath159 . and",
    "@xmath74 filter functions , @xmath160 where @xmath54 is a representative point in bin @xmath11 .",
    "however , i have found that this procedure produces statistics which do not exhibit the data compression properties of the sek10 statistics . ]",
    "i increase @xmath20 for each vector in the basis starting at @xmath161 and i use the logarithmic mean of each bin interval to evaluate the polynomial .",
    "the first two vectors in the basis are the constraint directions @xmath113 and @xmath114 so that the third vector is started with @xmath161 . as the number of roots in the legendre polynomials increases , they become harder to represent properly in the discrete binned space .",
    "thus when the index of the legendre polynomial @xmath20 is greater than @xmath162 , where @xmath9 is the number of bins in the interval , i switch to generating the fiducial basis by producing @xmath108 vectors at order @xmath20 divided into @xmath163 sections alternating between @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this construction generates as many roots in the interval as the legendre polynomial of order @xmath20 would have , but these roots are now resolved properly .",
    "note that the maximum value of @xmath20 is @xmath166 , so that one gets exactly @xmath166 roots when @xmath9 intervals alternate between @xmath164 and @xmath167 .",
    "then the gram - schmidt procedure is applied to the constraint vectors and the @xmath119 fiducial @xmath108 vectors as described above in order to produce the final @xmath108 filters .",
    "the factor of @xmath168 $ ] has been inserted to roughly account for the difference between the vector inner product definition and that in sek10 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cosebisbasis ] , i show the cosebi - like vector basis for @xmath169 and @xmath170 for 50 shear correlation function data points between 1 and 400 arcmin .    in figure [",
    "fig : cosebiss2n ] , i show the level of e / b - mode mixing for these statistics as a function of the number of shear correlation function bins .",
    "i have plotted the ratio of the first 12 e- and b - mode statistics to their errors for both des- and lsst - like surveys .",
    "note that in general these statistics are correlated , but to make this plot i only use the diagonal contributions to the error covariance matrix .",
    "the statistics in this plot were computed with @xmath39 , so any nonzero b - mode statistic amplitude is completely due to e / b - mode mixing .",
    "additionally , the e / b - mode mixing in the estimators is negligible if the nonzero amplitude of the b - mode statistic is well below the error bar on the statistic .",
    "this condition ensures that any statistically significant systematic effect is detectable and is not confused with e - modes due to e / b - mode mixing .    in general ,",
    "the level of e / b - mode mixing decreases as the number of bins used for the shear correlation function increases .",
    "additionally , it is clear that for a des - like survey fewer shear correlation function bins can be used than for an lsst - like survey .",
    "if one uses a threshold of the b - mode statistic being no more than 10% of the 1-sigma error bar , then a des - like survey will need of order @xmath171 bins whereas an lsst - like survey will need @xmath172 bins .",
    "this figure also demonstrates the data compression properties of these statistics . in the case of a des - like survey of order 50 shear correlation",
    "function data points can be compressed into only @xmath173 e - mode statistics which are measurably non - zero .",
    "an lsst - like survey has increased statistical power , compressing of order 100 data points into only @xmath174 statistically significant e - mode statistics .",
    "due to correlations between these remaining e - mode statistics , further data compression may be possible , but i will not explore this issue further in this work .      in this section ,",
    "i give an example of the use of spatially - local basis functions to build sets of b - mode estimators which can pinpoint the size and location of b - mode systematics in shear correlation function data .",

    "figure [ fig : hatwavebasis ] shows an example set of these filters for 100 correlation function data points between 1 and 400 arcmin .    in order to gain intuition into how these b - mode estimators work ,",
    "i show a simple , but somewhat contrived example ( however see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of two different kinds of b - mode systematics in figure [ fig : wvtest ] .",
    "the top row displays a smooth b - mode systematic in the @xmath47 correlation function , while the bottom row shows a b - mode systematic with much more fine scale variations .",
    "these b - mode systematics were generated by setting @xmath185 to be non - zero using simple gaussian kernels , the form of which is uninteresting , and then computing the shear correlation functions using equations  ( [ eqn : xipell ] ) and ( [ eqn : ximell ] ) . the contour plots show for each value of @xmath9 on the vertical axis , the amplitude of the b - mode statistics for each @xmath181 sized interval across the horizontal axis . in this type of analysis , a b - mode signal with more fine scale variation",
    "has a different signature than the smoother b - mode signal , with more b - mode signal detected in higher @xmath9 and thus smaller sized filters . for data with shape noise ,",
    "a similar contour plot can be made , except that the deviation from zero measured in units of the standard deviation should be used to produce the color scaling .",
    "the overall level of b - mode contamination can then be assessed via a @xmath186 statistic computed over all of the different estimators indexed by @xmath187 , accounting for the correlations between the different estimators .    here",
    "i have chosen to layout the @xmath188 filters in a simple geometric pattern . however ,",
    "when a b - mode signal crosses between two filters , the significance drops .",
    "thus it might be more advantageous to consider sets of filters which shift and scale in size more continuously .",
    "i leave this generalization to future work .",
    "note however that the filters i have presented here are offset between different levels @xmath9 so that in practice , no b - mode signal ever goes completely undetected .",
    "this general point can be clearly illustrated by examining the fourier - space filters @xmath189 introduced above for the wavelet - like @xmath188 statistics .",
    "these filters for @xmath190 are shown in figure [ fig : waveellwin ] .",
    "the peaks and troughs for each @xmath9 correspond to a single location of the filter in real space , with @xmath9 peaks and troughs present for the @xmath9-indexed filters .",
    "as the filters shift in real space over the shear correlation function range , they cover different , but overlapping ranges in fourier space .",
    "thus by combining filters of different size and location , any b - mode signals in fourier space will produce a nonzero amplitude in these filters .     for the @xmath190 wavelet - like statistics computed for @xmath191 $ ] arcmin with 100 shear correlation function data points .",
    "the different colors show each of the filters .",
    "the @xmath94 filters are approximately three orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath189 filters .",
    "the different filters in size ( the overall width of the peaks and troughs ) and location ( the mean location in @xmath20 for each set of peaks and troughs ) approximately cover all of @xmath20-space accessible given the angular range of the data.[fig : waveellwin ] ]      in this section i present the full ambiguous , e- and b - mode decompositions discussed in section  [ sec : ebmodedec ] using the cosebi - like statistics defined above .",

    "i use a basis composed of 50 correlation function bins logarithmically spaced from 1 to 400 arcmin .",
    "i find that the full basis composed of these different spaces completely spans the space of @xmath98 data points , demonstrating that at least one such approximate decomposition exists .    due to the fact that this decomposition is only approximate and that the matrices @xmath145 are not exactly orthogonal for the vectors @xmath74",
    ", the different subspaces will in general not be perfectly orthogonal to one another .",
    "the degree of orthogonality of the ambiguous , e- and b - mode subspaces can be characterized by the maximum absolute normalized projection of a basis vector of any one of the spaces onto the basis vectors of the other spaces , @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are vectors of length @xmath98 with the normal inner product definition .",
    "this quantity is just the cosine of the minimum angle between the vectors of any of the subspaces with the other . for subspaces which nearly share a basis vector ,",
    "this maximum absolute normalized projection will be @xmath195 , but it can not be greater than one or else two of the vectors in the basis would be linearly dependent . for spaces which are mutually orthogonal , this maximum absolute normalized projection will be zero .",
    "for the set of basis vectors just computed , i find that the maximum projection between the e- and b - mode subspaces is @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , the maximum projection between the e - mode and ambiguous subspaces is @xmath197 and for the b - mode and ambiguous subspaces is @xmath198 .",

    "however in this case , the ambiguous modes are less orthogonal to the e- and b - mode subspaces with the maximum absolute normalized projections being @xmath200 and @xmath201 respectively .",
    "the particularly poor orthogonality of the b - mode subspace to the ambiguous mode space in this case is reflected in the svd of the matrix @xmath136 computed with equal area binning .    as mentioned above",

    "* ) . using the approximate mode decomposition described in this section ,",
    "this point can be illustrated clearly and approached quantitatively .",

    "however the basic trends are clear .",
    "the b - mode subspace has very little information on the parameters as expected .",
    "any residual information is either a numerical artifact or is due to e / b - mode mixing .",
    "the e - mode subspace has most of the information , but the ambiguous modes carry a non - trivial fraction of the total information . by retaining the ambiguous modes in the analysis with the e - modes , most of the information can be restored in comparison with the full two - point function with the e- plus ambiguous mode fisher information being @xmath209 .",
    "i have tested several other fiducial choices besides the cosebi - like statistics for constructing the full mode decomposition of the correlation function data and found similar conclusions regarding the relative fisher information content of the various subspaces .",
    "similar conclusions hold for lsst - like surveys as well .",
    "while these fisher information calculations are not particularly realistic as survey projections , they illustrate nicely the cost of e / b - mode separation in cosmic shear .",
    "finally , these fisher information calculations can also illustrate the data compression properties of the cosebi - like statistics .",
    "in particular , for the des - like survey , the fisher information in the first eight e - mode statistics is @xmath210 as opposed to @xmath204 for all of the e - mode statistics .",
    "similarly , for the lsst - like survey using 100 correlation function bins in the same angular range as the des - like survey , the first ten e - mode statistics have an information content of @xmath211 as opposed to @xmath212 for all of the e - mode statistics .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "in this work , i have demonstrated that the use of two - point e / b - mode estimators with binned shear correlation function data will generally result in non - trivial e / b - mode mixing .",
    "i computed the amount of this mixing and provided new e / b - mode estimators which minimize the unwanted mode mixing .",
    "i also gave practical recipes for building and using these estimators with binned cosmic shear data .",
    "using these optimal estimators , i demonstrated that approximate decompositions of the vector space of binned correlation function points into ambiguous , e- and b - modes do exist .",
    "using one of these decompositions , i found that the ambiguous mode subspace contains a non - trivial amount of information on typical cosmological parameters .",
    "i also gave two example applications of these new estimators to generic problems in cosmic shear data analysis , data compression ( section  [ sec : cosebi ] ) and b - mode localization with wavelets ( section  [ sec : wvstats ] ) .",

    "they are linear combinations of the binned shear correlation function data , defined in equation  ( [ eqn : xpmlinstat ] ) , and thus treat the binning explicitly .",

    "the binning window functions are expected to be close to the geometric approximation used throughout this work . *",
    "they give quantitative criteria in terms of the e / b - mode mixing by which to decide the number of shear correlation function bins to use , demonstrated in figure  [ fig : cosebiss2n ] for the cosebi - like estimators .",

    "one can then choose a fiducial binning scheme and estimator choice that properly minimizes the e / b - mode mixing and retains all of the cosmological information",
    ". then these choices can be fixed throughout the data analysis process in order to avoid any observer biases in detecting or assessing b - mode contamination arising from how exactly the e / b - mode separation was done .",
    "additionally , in a blinded or close - box analysis one might not look at plots of the shear correlation function data until the entire analysis is complete . unfortunately in this case , one might miss crucial information about potential systematics in the _ shape _ of the shear correlation function data .",
    "the wavelet - like b - mode estimators presented in this work can be used as a substitute for and quantitative measure of the information gained by looking at the shape of the shear correlation function data .",
    "additionally , they can be applied in automated way to large data sets in order to pinpoint areas of potential systematic contamination for further investigation .",
    "importantly , because these estimators have a large degree of spatial locality , they can potentially provide crucial information on where any b - mode contamination is coming from and not just indicate its existence .    the ability to easily and quickly design e / b - mode estimators tailored to a specific purpose can potentially be very useful in practice as well .",
