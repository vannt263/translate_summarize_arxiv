    "a living system sustains in the diverse and continuously changing environment . in order to respond to the changes made in the surroundings , every living species developed complex signal transmission networks over the evolutionary time scale @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of these networks is to transmit the extracellular changes reliably and efficiently to the cell .",
    "in addition , these networks take care of different biochemical changes that are taking place within the cell .",
    "a typical signalling cascade comprises of one or several components of biochemical origin .",
    "the interactions between these components are probabilistic in nature , thus giving rise to stochastic kinetics .",
    "one of the tools to figure out the signal transmission mechanism in a fluctuating environment is information theory @xcite .",
    "the formalism of information theory provides a quantification of information transfer between the source ( signal ) and the target ( response ) .",
    "the measure of information transmission is characterized by mutual information ( mi ) , that quantifies the common information content of the source and the target .",
    "moreover , information theory provides a measure of fidelity of the signalling pathway @xcite .",
    "the notion of mi is conceptualized as the intersection of the entropy spaces of two stochastic variables @xcite .",
    "hence , mi signifies the average reduction in the uncertainty of prediction of one random variable when knowledge of another random variable is available .",
    "however , this information theoretic measure is symmetric in its argument random variables signifying the ` mutual ' attribution linked to it . for a generic two - step cascade ( tsc ) @xmath0 , although , mi among three variables is an ill defined concept , its usage can be validated if one considers @xmath1 to be the mi that the source species s shares with the pair of target species x and y. it is thus interesting to investigate whether the three variable mi can be utilised in such a way to shed light on various types of informational relationship among the three stochastic variables ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) .",
    "one prevalent approach in this respect is known as partial information decomposition ( pid ) @xcite . following the formalism of pid",
    "one can define an information theoretic measure , the net synergy @xmath5 , in terms of two and three variable mi - s @xcite @xmath6    at this point , one should take note of the fact that the net synergy can be both positive ( @xmath7 ) and negative ( @xmath8 ) valued .",
    "information theoretically , positive net synergy implies synergistic aspect of the target variables is prevalent over the extent of redundant character .",
    "negative net synergy conveys precisely the opposite implication .",
    "positive net synergy indicates the information shared between the source s and the targets ( x , y ) taken together as a single target is more than the sum of the information shared between s and the targets x , y considered individually in turn .",
    "negative net synergy indicates separately the targets share more information with the source than while considered together as a single target .",
    "zero net synergy ( @xmath9 ) is an interesting case to mention as it means that the targets x and y are informationally independent of each other since the information shared between the source and the targets does not depend on whether one takes the targets individually or together as a single target to compute different mi terms . as per the definition of the net synergy stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it is maximum while the total information is synergistic and assumes a minimum value when the total information is purely redundant in nature . in this study",
    ", we do not quantify the separate identification of synergy and redundancy .",
    "rather , we conceive the quantity of interest here as redundant synergy .",
    "information theoretically , the net synergy serves as a quantification marker of information independence between the random variables often characterized as source and target variables @xcite . although , the tags of source(s ) and target(s ) are not strict enough in information theoretic sense but while dealing with cascades or directed networks , in general , such classifications can be done suitably as the phenomenology or experimental realities demand .",
    "information theoretic ideas originated in shannon s classic work @xcite had formerly made an impressive impact in the field of biology through experimental neuroscience . in that domain , researchers had successfully used the technique to quantify the extent of information about the stimulus encoded in a neural response @xcite .",
    "earlier work regarding efficient communication systems has dealt with the capacity of nonlinear information channel considering the physical limits @xcite .",
    "investigations on maximization of mi in biochemical networks of different topologies have also shown the robustness of information transduction even with considerably low molecule numbers @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical papers dealing with mi has done so in the gaussian framework given the benefit of exactness of calculated mi @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted for a gaussian system , mi becomes equal to the channel capacity @xcite .",
    "the same work also draws our attention to the fact that application of linear noise approximation applied in a network of interest is compatible with the gaussian model .",
    "this line of approach has been taken care of in the present work .",
    "earlier works suggest quantitative agreement between steady state solutions obtained through linear noise approximation and simulations carried with gillespie algorithm even when biochemical molecules have low copy numbers ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "consideration of low copy numbers in the dynamics shows transmission of more than 1 bit of information .",
    "our theoretical calculation reveals that not only the individual two and three variable mi - s but also the net synergy which acts as the predictor of informational independence can have magnitudes of greater than 1 bit even when signalling molecule has low copy number ( see sec .",
    "the idea of synergy has been explored in the previous work of schneidman et al .",

    "@xcite made the analysis close to the biological realities prompting us to study simplified linear model along with the nonlinear one to compare the fluctuations level of the system under both scenarios .",
    "in ref  @xcite , the authors have studied a network where multiple target genes receive signalling from a single input .",
    "it is noted that those target genes turn on at successively higher levels of concentration of the input signal .",
    "consequently , it is pointed out that there happens to be redundancy among the signals conveyed . unlike the treatment rendered in refs .",
    "@xcite , we kept the input concentration , along with other species concentrations , fixed at steady state to extract optimal functionality out of the constituents of the tsc motif and tuned the degradation rate of the input signal @xcite .",
    "the first focal theme of our work is to investigate redundancy in the information transduction process using the generalized mathematical measure of the net synergy ( see eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) ) along with the adoption of a motif based approach . in this connection , it is to be noted that noise has an important role to play in the information transmission machinery .",
    "an excellent review @xcite has covered the ubiquitous functionalities of noise in several biological phenomena . ref .",
    "@xcite deals with suppression of the noise by feedback mechanisms within the physical limits .",
    "earlier work @xcite also hinted at the tradeoff between redundancy reduction and noise reduction .",
    "the experimental work @xcite has also strengthened this viewpoint by pointing out that tnf signalling pathway can overcome noise induced limitations on transmitting information through adoption of complex signalling networks which by construction incorporate redundancies .",
    "our second focal theme in the present work has been analyzing this nontrivial connection between redundancy and noise in a quantitative manner to shed light on the fidelity of the motif . in this connection ,",
    "bowsher et al . suggests that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) to be an able quantifier of fidelity @xcite which we have adopted .",
