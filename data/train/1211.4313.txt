    "the typical feature of turbulence evolution in a beam - plasma system is the formation of superthermal tails on the distribution function of plasma electrons .",
    "these tails are often observed in space and laboratory plasmas . in particular , the electron distribution in the solar wind ( see the review paper @xcite and references therein ) was found to be well approximated by the family of kappa - functions @xcite , decaying in velocity as a power law .",
    "moreover , it has been shown recently that these functions describe asymptotically stationary solutions of weak turbulence equations , in which self - consistent evolution of both wave and particles spectra is taken into account @xcite . in laboratory experiments , beam - plasma interaction appears to be much more intense than in the solar wind , that is why it results in the formation of strongly non - maxwellian electron distribution , in which most of the plasma kinetic energy is concentrated in a rather small population of fast electrons .",
    "such a slowly decaying momentum distribution of plasma electrons ( @xmath0 ) was really observed in the experiments on turbulent plasma heating by the powerful electron beam in the multi - mirror trap gol-3 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that such an energetic tail of superthermal electrons should modify not only the linear dispersion of plasma modes , but also probabilities of various nonlinear processes responsible for formation of the turbulent spectrum . in the experiments of interest @xcite ,",
    "the high - current relativistic electron beam interacts with the plasma in the regime of strong plasma turbulence . in this case , the main nonlinear process responsible for transferring the wave energy of beam - driven plasma oscillations to the nonresonant part of turbulent spectrum is the modulational instability .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate how the dispersion of linear plasma modes and the growth rate of the modulational instability pumped by the monochromatic langmuir wave are modified in a strongly non - maxwellian plasma .",
    "our interest to this problem is motivated by the need to interpret the experimental information about the intensity and the frequency spectrum of electromagnetic radiation generated in the turbulent plasma near the second harmonic of plasma frequency .",
    "recent calculations of the radiation power @xcite for these experiments were based on the well known analytical model of strong plasma turbulence @xcite . according to this model ,",
    "the typical wavenumber of modulational instability determines the size of the energy - containing region of turbulent spectrum , and the typical growth rate allows to estimate the saturation level of turbulence energy .",
    "thus , the study of the modulational instability in a non - maxwellian plasma will clarify whether superthermal electrons are able to modify the main parameters of emitting part of the turbulent spectrum .",
    "the linear analysis of langmuir waves in an isotropic plasma with a power - law momentum distribution in the framework of relativistic kinetic theory has been applied recently to the solar wind plasma near the orbit of the earth @xcite . in our paper , we study the dispersion properties of much hotter plasma that is typical to the laboratory beam - plasma experiments , and we focus on the validity of various widely used approximations .",
    "investigations of modulational instability in relativistic plasmas with the maxwell - jttner distribution @xcite or in the kappa - distributed plasmas with nonrelativistic superthermal tails @xcite are also of interest in last years .",
    "in contrast to these papers , we consider the modulational instability of a langmuir wave in an unmagnetized plasma with the relativistic power - law momentum distribution of plasma electrons .    in section ii we obtain numerical solutions of the linear dispersion equation for",
    "the potential plasma waves of isotropic non - maxwellian plasma and compare them to the results predicted by fluid and kinetic approximations . in section iii , for the modulational instability , we deduce the dispersion equation that takes into account relativistic and kinetic effects for high - frequency oscillations , and compare numerical solutions for unstable spectra with the case of maxwellian plasma . in the concluding section iv",
    ", we formulate our main results .",
    "let us analyze the proper waves of non - maxwellian plasma assuming cold ions and using the following distribution function for electrons : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the heaviside step function , @xmath3 is the threshold momentum , above which there are no electrons in the plasma , @xmath4 is the typical momentum spread of plasma electrons , and @xmath5 is the coefficient corresponding to the normalization @xmath6 . for the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the rest mass of electons ,",
    "@xmath10 is the speed of light ) , this function is best suited for the description of real electron distribution observed in beam - plasma experiments at the gol-3 facility .",
    "the feature of this distribution function is that , for small momenta @xmath11 , it does not differ greatly from the maxwellian function with the temperature @xmath12 kev and , for large momenta @xmath13 , it has a power - law tail decreasing so slowly that most of the plasma kinetic energy is concentrated in superthermal electrons ( fig .",
    "[ r1 ] ) .     for parameters typical to beam - plasma experiments at the gol-3 facility . ]",
    "the tail component of this particular distribution ( @xmath13 ) contains 28% of the particles and 89% of the kinetic energy ; the effective temperature of the whole distribution is @xmath14 whereas the temperature of core electrons with the relative density @xmath15 turns out to be much smaller : @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the relativistic factor ) .",
    "it is well known that dispersion laws of langmuir and ion - acoustic waves in the maxwellian plasma have the following dimensionless forms : @xmath18 @xmath19 here frequencies are expressed in units of the plasma frequency @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electron charge and @xmath22 is the plasma density , wavenumbers are measured in units of @xmath23 , and the electron temperature in units of @xmath24 .",
    "these formulas have a simple hydrodynamic interpretation , according to which the electron pressure gradient @xmath25 drives low - frequency acoustic oscillations of ions ( @xmath26 ) and creates an additional force for high - frequency langmuir oscillations of electrons ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "to adapt these insights to the case of non - maxwellian plasma , we should clarify what temperature ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) is more appropriate for the correct description of wave dispersion .",
    "as we shall show later , the same expressions for real parts of wave frequencies can be derived from the exact kinetic theory , if we use the hydrodynamic approximation for langmuir waves and kinetic approximation for ion - acoustic waves . from the nonrelativistic theory",
    "one can conclude that , for langmuir oscillations , the role of temperature is played by @xmath30 whereas , for ion - acoustic oscillations , the temperature is defined in another way @xmath31 in the maxwellian plasma with the temperature @xmath32 , these values are equal , @xmath33 , but even from these simple formulas one can see that relative contributions of superthermal electrons to @xmath34 and @xmath35 differ substantially . in a non - maxwellian plasma , the energetic tail component should lead to the significant increase of @xmath34 , since it is proportional to the averaged kinetic energy of particles , and should not contribute to the value @xmath35 , in which the inverse energy should be averaged .",
    "thus , in the nonrelativistic case , superthermal electrons increase the thermal correction to the langmuir wave frequency that is determined by the effective temperature of the whole distribution @xmath28 and have almost no impact on ion - acoustic waves , for which the thermal spread of core electrons @xmath29 is more suitable to the role of temperature .",
    "let us now find out how these results change , if the tail of superthermal electrons extends to relativistic energies .",
    "first we will derive dispersion laws @xmath36 and damping rates @xmath37 of potential plasma waves in the hydrodynamic and kinetic limits , and then investigate applicability of these approximations by comparing approximate results with numerical solutions of the exact dispersion relation .    for slowly damping waves of isotropic plasma , the dispersion equation @xmath38 can be reduced to the form @xmath39 where real and imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity are defined by the integrals @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 the dispersion law in this case is found from the equation @xmath42 and the damping rate is calculated as @xmath43 we can calculate the electron contribution to @xmath44 using the hydrodynamic approximation ( @xmath45 ) for langmuir waves and the kinetic approximation ( @xmath46 ) for ion - acoustic waves .",
    "it means that , in the former case , we can use the expansion @xmath47 and in the latter case @xmath48 @xmath49 is determined for both types of waves by the unified expression : @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the momentum of electrons getting into cherenkov resonance with the wave , @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the corresponding relativistic factor .",
    "thus , the real frequency of langmuir wave is governed by the equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and the real frequency of ion - acoustic wave is determined by @xmath57 where @xmath58 in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath59 and calculation of electron temperature really reduces to averaging either the kinetic energy @xmath60 or the reciprocal value @xmath61 . from these formulas",
    ", it is seen that relativistic effects manifest themselves in decreasing the plasma frequency ( @xmath62 ) due to weighting of tail electrons .",
    "moreover , the temperature @xmath34 in the relativistic case ceases to be proportional to the total kinetic energy and can no longer be identified with the value @xmath63 .",
    "indeed , the expression averaged in @xmath34 ( [ e18 ] ) differs from the value @xmath64 by the factor @xmath65 which substantially reduces the relative contribution of fast electrons to the thermal correction to the langmuir wave frequency . as to the temperature @xmath35",
    ", its calculation for both low @xmath66 and high @xmath67 energies reduces to averaging the value that is inversely proportional to the energy .",
    "it means that relativistic effects do not change the earlier conclusion that superthermal electrons do not contribute to the electron pressure perturbation driving low - frequency acoustic oscillations . for the distribution function ( [ e1 ] )",
    ", the temperature @xmath34 accounting for the relativistic effects appears to be twice smaller than the effective temperature of the whole distribution ( @xmath68 ) and the temperature @xmath35 remains close to the temperature of low - energy core electrons ( @xmath69 ) as in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the exact dispersion relation for the damping plasma modes can be written in the form @xmath70 where the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity is still defined by ( [ e15 ] ) and the function @xmath71 means the principal branch of complex logarithm .",
    "for langmuir waves , the comparison of numerical solution of this equation @xmath72 with the results of the hydrodynamic approximation @xmath73 @xmath74,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ r2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the approximate solution for the parameters of interest is adequate in the long - wavelength ( @xmath75 ) part of the spectrum only .",
    "oscillations with shorter wavelength falls in the region of strong landau damping and demonstrate the anomalous dispersion ( @xmath76 ) . for ion - acoustic waves , on the contrary , the kinetic approximation ( [ e19 ] ) turns out to be so accurate that both real and imaginary parts of complex frequency fit the numerical solution of exact dispersion equation in the wide range of wavenumbers ( fig .",

    "thus , the main contribution to these integrals comes from low - energy core electrons , the typical velocity of which is really much smaller than phase velocities of high - frequency satellites and the speed of light .",
    "it allows us to neglect relativistic effects in calculations of @xmath86 and transform the equations to the well - known form @xcite @xmath88 the specific features of non - maxwellian plasma in these equations manifest themselves only in changing of temperature notation from @xmath32 to @xmath35 and in accurate calculation of permittivities @xmath89 in the framework of relativistic kinetic theory .",
    "thus , the modulational instability in a non - maxwellian plasma can be described by the following equation : @xmath90\\ ] ] where @xmath91 corresponds to the linear dispersion of ion - acoustic waves , and the parameter @xmath92 determines the relative energy of the langmuir pump wave .",

    "for example , let us find a numerical solution of the dispersion relation ( [ e36 ] ) in the case when the role of long - wavelength pump is played by the undamped langmuir wave with the wavenumber @xmath97 , the frequency @xmath98 and the energy @xmath99 .",
    "[ r4 ] shows that        the growth rate of modulational instability @xmath100 reaches the maximum for the perturbations propagating along @xmath101 .",
    "since this maximum falls in the region of rather small wavenumbers @xmath102 , it is reasonable to estimate how accurately the unstable spectrum can be described by the fluid approach , in which thermal corrections to the dispersion of high - frequency oscillations depends on the increased effective temperature @xmath103 . in this limit",
    ", the functions @xmath89 in the dispersion equation should have the simple form @xmath104 the unstable spectrum of longitudinally propagating modulational perturbations ( @xmath105 ) in comparison with the case of maxwellian plasma ( @xmath106 ) is shown in fig .",

    "it is seen that the increase in the temperature @xmath34 with respect to @xmath35 in the hydrodynamic limit results in almost the same narrowing of the spectrum of modulational instability ( by the factor @xmath107 ) that is observed in the case of exact kinetic description of langmuir waves .",
    "another important result is that the appearance of the tail component in the electron distribution does not change neither the maximum of the growth rate nor its position in the wavenumber space .",
    "it means that we can estimate the typical gtowth rate and the corresponding wavenumber of modulational instability in the non - maxwellian plasma without the detailed study of the real distribution function . for this purpose",
    ", we can restrict ourselves by the case of maxwellian plasma with the temperature corresponding to the temperature of core electrons .",
    "in the present study we have calculated dispersion laws and damping rates of langmuir and ion - acoustic oscillations in the case , when an isotropic plasma has the energetic tail of superthermal electrons typical to the beam - plasma experiments at the multi - mirror trap gol-3 .",
    "the specific feature of such distribution is that most of the kinetic energy is concentrated in a small population of fast electrons .",
    "the concept of temperature in this case loses its usual meaning , since the energy spread of the bulk of electrons appears to be much smaller than the total kinetic energy .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion of linear langmuir waves in the long - wavelength region can be correctly described by the fluid approach , in which the effective temperature @xmath34 exceeds substantially the temperature of core electrons @xmath29 , but , due to relativistic effects , does not reach the temperature of the whole distribution .",
    "ion - acoustic waves , in turn , are shown to be well described by the kinetic approximation with the temperature of low - energy core electrons @xmath108 .",
    "modifications in the linear dispersion of high - frequency waves in a non - maxwellian plasma should have an impact on the build - up efficiency of modulational instability playing the important role in the scenarios of strong plasma turbulence .",
    "we have solved numerically the dispersion equation for modulational perturbations , in which both kinetic and relativistic effects are taken into account .",
    "it is shown that the unstable spectrum in the non - maxwellian plasma narrows significantly without changing in the growth rate and wavelength of the most unstable perturbation .",
