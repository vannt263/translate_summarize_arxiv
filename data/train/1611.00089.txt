    "necessarily underlies any inferences made about the mw s potential .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , different families of orbital histories are allowed depending on the mass of the sgr progenitor , due to dynamical friction . a more massive sgr progenitor ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 ) would fall in from larger galactocentric distances ( @xmath4  kpc ) and undergo stronger mass stripping and dynamical friction",
    "conversely , the sgr progenitor may have been as light as @xmath5  m@xmath3 provided its initial separation was comparable to current apocentric distances of @xmath6  kpc .",

    "since these early efforts to model the sgr orbit , there has been mounting evidence in favor of a more massive sgr progenitor @xcite .",
    "this calls for a renewed effort to model the sgr orbit , simultaneously accounting for higher progenitor mass and initial separation . in this paper",
    ", we set out to find a model for the full infall of the sgr dwarf into the mw , until it reaches its current observed position and velocity .",
    "this includes the early infall phase at galactocentric radii @xmath10 - 80  kpc not simulated by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . the survival of the sgr satellite until the present day implies that it can not have formed deep inside the mw halo , where it would have been cannibalized already .",

    "figure [ fig:3dmatch ] shows both the observed and simulated three - dimensional position and velocity of the sgr core at the present time in relation to the sun . across the many test simulations carried out for this work , it is generally the case that the simulated sgr core is slightly more distant than observed .",
    "this challenge in reaching small galactocentric radii likely arises due to our choice of initial conditions , with the sgr progenitor starting at larger distances than previously considered for example by @xcite and @xcite . despite the much larger initial separation chosen here ,",
    "the mw - sgr distance and relative velocity vectors are still matched within approximately @xmath139 .",
    "stronger dynamical friction may help reaching smaller galactocentric separations , suggesting that the sgr progenitor may have initially been more massive than considered in this study ( @xmath61  m@xmath3 ) .",
    "testing the dependence of the parameter match on the model mw halo could also provide useful constraints on its properties , a possibility we plan to explore in more depth in a follow - up paper .",
    "figure [ fig : largestream ] presents the behavior of the sgr progenitor s collisionless components at the time of best match in the simulation . following @xcite , the coordinates of the stream particles",
    "are projected on the debris plane defined by the pole located at @xmath140 .",
    "prominent tidal features are clearly visible for both the dark matter and stellar particles .",
    "shells and arcs corresponding to apocentric pile - ups appear in both the stellar and dark matter component .",
    "interestingly , both the dark and visible particles form large - scale streams at galactocentric radii well beyond the apocenter distances reached by the sgr core . we have labeled the three most prominent such extensions n@xmath141 , n@xmath142 and s , standing for the northwestern , northeastern and southern branches , respectively .",
    "we expect the sharpness of these stellar structures to be affected by the initial distribution of stars in the sgr model . for a disk - less progenitor ,",
    "the streams are likely to be less well - defined .",
    "currently , the most distant tidal debris identified are part of the sgr stream trailing tail , with apocentric distances on the order of @xmath143  kpc according to @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : trajsep ] shows that our model predicts significant tidal features at distances @xmath144  kpc .              in figure",
    "[ fig : streamoverview ] we present a comparison between available data and the modeled stream features projected on the sgr orbital plane as defined by @xcite . in the right panel ,",
    "black crosshairs show data from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 and 8 as aggregated in figure 10 of @xcite .",
    "the size of the markers are indicative of the largest distance errors present in the dataset .",
    "both the leading and trailing arm sdss detections have obvious counterparts in the simulation .",
    "the leading branch of the simulated stream presents a small offset both with the observed data and the model by @xcite shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) : the apocenter distance appears @xmath39  kpc larger than the measured value of @xmath145  kpc @xcite , representing a @xmath146% mismatch .",
    "the position angle of the apocenter location is also slightly different from the data .",
    "@xcite have argued that the precession angle of only @xmath147 measured from the sdss data is an indication that the mw dark matter density falls more quickly with radius than a logarithmic potential ( with typical precession angles of @xmath148 ) .",
    "while orbital energy and angular momentum also play a minor role , the fact that the simulated precession angle appears @xmath149 larger than the measured value might suggest a steeper model potential is needed for the mw .    however , the model s most promising feature is that it successfully reproduces the distant trailing arm of the sgr stream for the first time .",
    "initially detected by @xcite , remote sgr stellar debris in the northern hemisphere were later confirmed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "earlier studies hesitated to assign this structure to the sgr stream , as simulations did not show any counterparts to these distant stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "importantly , our model correctly replicates both the measured apocenter distance of @xmath150  kpc and the position angle measured by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : radec ] shows the present - day distribution of the simulated sgr stars in different projections of phase - space .",
    "the left - hand - side panels feature all sgr star particles inside a galactocentric radius of 100  kpc , along with stellar tracer data from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) from @xcite .",
    "overall , the simulation produces a reasonable match to the observed tidal debris characteristics shown in black squares . unlike the stellar distribution presented in @xcite",
    ", we successfully reproduce the distant branch of the leading arm observed at ra  @xmath151 and distances @xmath152  kpc .",
    "the model however predicts comparatively fewer stars at smaller distances .",
    "this comparison is limited , however , by the low number of sgr stellar particles in the simulation and the resulting relatively sparse sampling . the simulated stellar locations in ( ra , dec )",
    "feature a systematic offset compared to the data , and the location of highest particle density does not line up exactly with the sgr centroid .",
    "such coherent shifts of the simulated stream occasionally appeared across the numerous test simulations carried out for this study .",
    "the combination of coarse sampling of possible sun locations on the fibonacci sphere ( see section [ subsec : sammethods ] ) as well as the time interval of 25  myr between subsequent output snapshots may be responsible for these offsets .",
    "finer sampling and tuning of the simulation parameters would likely remove this issue .",
    "the run of line of sight velocities for the leading arm ( @xmath153 ) features a discrepancy with the data similar to that discussed in other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that a prolate model of the mw potential is required to solve this mismatch .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite point out that such models introduce a discordance with the precession angles measured from stream m - giants . while these studies disagree on the exact nature of the mw triaxiality ( oblate vs. prolate ) ,",
    "there is a consensus that it is difficult to reproduce the leading arm radial velocities with a simple spherically symmetric model ( such as the one used in our study ) . on the other hand , some papers @xcite",
    "have shown that the lmc can introduce significant perturbations to the phase - space distribution of sgr debris .",
    "these hypotheses could be tested in future iterations of the orbital model presented in our study .",
    "the set of panels on the right of figure  [ fig : radec ] shows the predicted distribution of stars beyond distances of 100  kpc , where no sgr stream debris have yet been identified with certainty .",
    "the large - scale tidal features labeled in figure  [ fig : largestream ] appear as prominent clouds of stars in these panels .",
    "the structures located at ra  @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 correspond to those labeled n@xmath141 , n@xmath142 , and s in figure  [ fig : largestream ] , respectively .",
    "these distant branches can be distinguished from the closer debris in that area of the sky through line - of - sight velocities ( color - coded with a different range for the distant stars ) , which are generally lower by @xmath157  km  s@xmath74 since they approach turnaround .",
    "while no tidal streams were so far identified at such large distances @xcite , figure  [ fig : radec ] includes the parameters of the few mw stars found at distances @xmath158  kpc . a variety of stellar tracers",
    "have been used to map the inner halo . however , due to faint limits on the order of @xmath159 , surveys so far have only yielded a dozen or so stars beyond 100  kpc . @xcite",
    "provide a sample of distant blue horizontal branch and n - type carbon stars , later complemented by the m - giants detected by @xcite . in their ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) data , @xcite were able to identify two stars with distances above 200  kpc , making them the most distant known mw stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : radec ] shows that these most distant stars appear consistent with the remote northern stream branch predicted in our simulation .",
    "@xcite already associated the m - giants in a distance range of 20 - 90  kpc in the ukidss data with sgr .",
    "however , the more distant detections in their sample were not connected with the stream because the models of @xcite do not feature stars beyond @xmath160  kpc .",
    "our study shows that some of the most distant known mw stars could have originated in sgr .",
    "we have taken a two - pronged approach to building a new model of the sgr orbit through the mw halo .",
    "rather than integrate the present - day phase - space coordinates back in time , we perform an exploration of parameter space with a semi - analytic integration of the sgr trajectory starting 7 - 8  gyr ago .",
    "this method is chosen because it allows for the inclusion of non time - reversible effects .",
    "in particular , dynamical friction and tidal stripping are expected to be important in the regime where the mass of the sgr progenitor is @xmath161  m@xmath3 .",
    "we then build on these results to simulate the trajectory of sgr with gadget and compare the resulting tidal stream to observational data .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .   comparing the simulated position and velocity of sgr today to the measured quantities , we find that our analytic model favors a narrow range of the initial orbital angular momentum of sgr , with large incidence angles ( @xmath121 ) and initial velocities in the range @xmath122  km  s@xmath123  km  s@xmath74 .",
    "the mock sgr stream resulting from the gadget simulation reproduces most of the 2mass @xcite sky positions , heliocentric distances , and line of sight velocities .",
    "similarly to previous studies , the leading arm line of sight velocities are not replicated by the model , suggesting that further work on the triaxiality of the mw halo or the inclusion of the lmc influence is necessary .",
    "the simulated debris stream projected on the plane of the sgr orbit is in unprecedentedly good agreement with the sdss stellar tracers from @xcite .",
    "the stream apocentric distances and position angles are reproduced to within 20% of the measured values .",
    "in particular , the model of the sgr orbit presented here is the first to reproduce the recently detected distant trailing arm at @xmath162  kpc .",
    "we believe that this feature arises naturally because of the larger initial separation ( 125  kpc ) used in our simulation compared to other works in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "above all , this work predicts the existence of two novel and distant arms of the sgr stream .",
    "currently the most distant sdss stream detections are located at distances of @xmath163  kpc @xcite .",
    "the simulation presented here includes stellar overdensities at distances of up to @xmath164  kpc , extending beyond the mw virial radius .",
    "we provide their predicted positions on the sky , heliocentric distances and line of sight velocities for possible future observational searches .",
    "the most distant known stars of the mw coincide with our predicted streams in both position and small radial velocities .",
    "if verified observationally , the distant branches of the sgr stream would be the farthest - ranging stellar stream in the mw halo known to date .",
    "ukidss is sensitive to m - giants beyond the mw virial radius and its distant detections appear consistent with our predicted stream .",
    "further findings within existing datasets may be possible with the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) forced photometry method , or with the dark energy camera legacy survey ( decals ) . in the future ,",
    "the high depth of large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) data will allow detailed mapping of the outer halo in the visible band , while the wide field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) will improve on current ukidss photometry in the infrared .",
    "the detection and characterization of the distant branches of the sgr stream would provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the outer envelope of the mw , which is also influenced by the neighboring andromeda galaxy .",
    "the _ gaia _ mission will accurately map a large volume of the mw at smaller galactocentric radii . with a complete picture of the mw mass distribution from the solar neighborhood to the outskirts of the halo",
    ", we will be able to place our galaxy and the local group in a cosmological context .",
