    "the basic parameters of anisotropic lattices with improved action are important information for numerical simulations . in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on perturbative calculations of these parameters , but some of them are confirmed by numerical simulations .",
    "+ the improved actions we study in this work consist of terms @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent plaquette and 6-link rectangular loops respectively , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 .",
    "the improved actions cover i ) tree level symanzik s action(@xmath14)@xcite , ii ) iwasaki s action(@xmath15)@xcite , and iii ) qcdtaro s action(@xmath16)@xcite etc .",
    "+ for these classes of improved actions the anisotropic lattice is formulated in the same way as in the case of standard plaquette action@xcite .",
    "we introduce the coupling constant and lattice spacing in space direction @xmath1 , @xmath17 and those in temperature direction @xmath2 , @xmath18 . with these parameters",
    "the action on the anisotropic lattice is written as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "+ in this study , @xmath0 parameter and the ratio @xmath23 are calculated and the derivatives of the coupling constants with respect to the anisotropy parameter , @xmath24 , @xmath25 will be discussed .",
    "in weak coupling expansions , the relation between the couping constants on the anisotropic lattice and those on the isotropic lattice are obtained as follows@xcite .",
    "we calculate the coefficients of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the action in one loop order . @xmath28",
    "the same calculation is done on the isotropic lattice .",
    "we require that the effective action is independent of the method of regularization",
    ". then the relations are derived .",
    "@xmath30 on an isotropic lattice(@xmath31 ) , gauge invariance means @xmath32 .",
    "+ for the calculation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we employ the background field method@xcite used by iwasaki and sakai@xcite in the calculation of the @xmath0 parameters of improved actions on the isotropic lattice .",
    "the details of the method will be reported in the forthcoming publications .",
    "+ the @xmath35 and @xmath36 have infrared divergences , but in the difference they are cancelled .",
    "the cancellation of the divergence is a delicate problem .",
    "the following method is used .",
    "@xmath37 in the first and third terms , the infrared divergence is canceled exactly for improved and standard actions .",
    "the second term is already calculated by karsch@xcite where the regularization of the infrared divergence could be done by an analytic integration of the fourth component of the loop momentum .",
    "+ with these @xmath36,@xmath35 functions , @xmath0 and @xmath38 are expressed as follows .",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 the ratios @xmath41 are shown in fig.1 .    except for the qcdtaro s action , they have similar @xmath42 dependences .",
    "the more interesting differences are seen in the ratio @xmath38 . in fig.2 , we show @xmath43 , which determines @xmath38 .    it is found that as @xmath12 decreases @xmath43 changes sign .",
    "namely for iwasaki s and qcdtaro s improved actions , @xmath44 , and at @xmath45 , @xmath46 for all @xmath42 .",
    "this result is very interesting and is not what we have expected .",
    "then in the next section , we calculate the parameter @xmath38 nonperturbatively and confirm the perturbative results .",
    "nonperturbatively , the parameter @xmath38 is calculated by the relation @xmath47@xcite@xcite@xcite , where @xmath48 is a bare the anisotropy parameter which appears in the action , @xmath49 while the renormalized the anisotropy parameter is defined by @xmath50 . for the probe of the scale in the space and temperature direction , we use the lattice potential in these directions which is defined by , @xmath51 similarly for the potential in the space direction",
    "here we fix @xmath52 , and calculate the rate for a few @xmath48 @xmath53 then we search for the point @xmath54 by interpolating with respect to @xmath48@xcite@xcite . +",
    "the simulations are done on the @xmath55 lattice , in the large @xmath56 region .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 , together with those of perturbative calculations .",
    "+    it is found that the agreement of both results is good .",
    "so the @xmath12 dependences of the @xmath38 ratio is also confirmed by the numerical simulation , a very exciting result for improved actions .",
    "the exact calculation of these derivatives are not carried out yet .",
    "however we could estimate them from the slope of the @xmath36 and @xmath35 at @xmath31 and @xmath59 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.4 .",
    "they should satisfy following sum rule@xcite , @xmath60 the saturation of the sum rule is good .",
    "+ notice that the derivatives change sign as @xmath12 decreases .",
    "these coefficients play important role in the calculation of internal energy and pressure . as the sign of these coefficients changes for the improved actions",
    ", it may be interesting to calculate thermodynamic quantities with these improved actions .",
    "+ in conclusion , the study of anisotropic lattice with improved action shows very interesting properties as shown in figs.1,2,3,4 .",
    "the study of finite temperature physics with these improved action seems to be very exciting .",
