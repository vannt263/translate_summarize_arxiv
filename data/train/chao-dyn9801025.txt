    "the semiclassical analysis has proven to be a very useful tool in the field of `` quantum chaos '' as well as in many other fields .",
    "nevertheless , one should bear in mind , that it only _ approximates _ the true quantal solution .",
    "thus , it is imperative to know what are the _ errors _ which are inherent to the semiclassical approximation , and whether they could be considered as sufficiently small for the problem at hand .",
    "we shall focus our attention on one particular application of the semiclassical approximation : the calculation of the energy spectra of classically chaotic systems .",
    "the analytical tool that is used for this purpose is the semiclassical gutzwiller trace formula @xcite which expresses the _ quantum _ spectral density in terms of _ classical _ quantities , and in particular the actions and stabilities of classical periodic orbits .",
    "the trace formula was used , among other things , to explain and discuss spectral statistics and their relation to the universal predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite . however , a prerequisite for the use of the semiclassical approximation to compute short ",
    "range statistics is that it is able to reproduce the exact spectrum within an error which is comparable to or less than the mean level spacing !",
    "this is a demanding requirement , and quite often , the ability of the semiclassical approximation to reproduce precise levels for high  dimensional systems is doubted , and on the following grounds .",
    "the mean level spacing depends on the dimensionality ( number of freedoms ) of the system , and it is @xmath6 .",
    "gutzwiller @xcite uses an argument by pauli @xcite to show that in general the error margin for the semiclassical approximation scales as @xmath7 _ independently of the dimensionality_. applied to the trace formula , the expected error in units of the mean spacing , which is the figure of merit in the present context , is therefore expected to be @xmath8",
    ". we shall refer to this as the  traditional estimate \" .",
    "it sets @xmath9 as a critical dimension for the applicability of the semiclassical trace formula and hence for the validity of the conclusions which are drawn from it .",
    "the few systems in @xmath10 dimensions which were numerically investigated display spectral statistics which adhere to the predictions of rmt as accurately as their counterparts in @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , the `` traditional estimate '' can not be entirely correct in the present context , and we shall explain the reasons why it is inadequate when we discuss other error bounds in the next section .",
    "it is rather surprising that the problem of the accuracy of the semiclassical trace formula was rather rarely touched upon in the literature .",
    "gutzwiller quotes the `` traditional '' estimate of @xmath8 which was discussed above @xcite .",
    "gaspard and alonso @xcite and alonso and gaspard @xcite derived explicit ( generic ) @xmath11 corrections for the periodic orbit terms in the trace formula , but did not investigate their effect on the semiclassical accuracy of energy levels .",
    "diffraction corrections were discussed in the context of the trace formula by vattay , wirzba and rosenqvist @xcite and by primack et al . @xcite . also in these works the focus is on the corrections to individual periodic orbit terms rather than on the overall effect on energy levels .",
    "boasman @xcite studied the accuracy of the boundary integral method ( bim ) @xcite for 2d billiards in the case that the exact kernel is replaced by its semiclassical asymptotic approximation .",
    "he finds that the resulting error is of the same magnitude as the mean spacing , which is consistent with the traditional estimate .",
    "however , boasman s work does not refer directly to the trace formula and to the periodic orbits contributions .",
    "the works of bleher @xcite and of prosen and robnik @xcite discuss the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation in the integrable case .",
    "the purpose of this work is to address the subject of the accuracy of the semiclassical trace formula conceptually , theoretically and numerically .",
    "we shall be interested in particular in the dependence of the semiclassical error on the _ dimension _ of the system .",
    "to do so , we shall have to start by developing the basic concepts and define the measures we use for a quantitative estimate of the spectral error ( section [ sec : accuracy - measures ] ) .",
    "the accuracy of the semiclassical approximation of the quantal energy spectrum will be then studied via the dual classical spectrum of actions and stabilities of periodic orbits ( time spectrum ) .",
    "this will enable us to use our data base of quantum levels and periodic orbits for the sinai billiards in two and three dimensions for a direct evaluation of the semiclassical error ( section [ sec : sinai - numerics ] ) .",
    "we shall summarize the paper and discuss a few relevant points in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in order to define a proper error measure for the semiclassical approximation of the energy spectrum one has to clarify a few issues .",
    "in contrast with the ebk quantization which gives an _ explicit _",
    "formula for the spectrum , the semiclassical spectrum for chaotic systems is _ implicit _ in the trace formula , or in the semiclassical expression for the spectral determinant . to extract the semiclassical spectrum we recall that the exact spectrum , @xmath12 , can be obtained from the exact counting function : @xmath13 by solving the equation @xmath14 in the last equation",
    ", an arbitrarily small amount of smoothing must be applied to the heavyside function . in complete analogy ,",
    "one obtains the semiclassical spectrum @xmath15 as @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a semiclassical approximation of @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath17 with which we start is not necessarily a sharp counting function .",
    "however , once @xmath15 is known , we can `` rectify ''",
    "the smooth @xmath17 into the sharp counting function @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20 the simplest choice for @xmath17 is the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite truncated at the heisenberg time , which is what we shall use in the present paper .",
    "alternatively , one can start from the regularized berry  keating zeta function @xmath21 @xcite , and define @xmath22 , in which case @xmath23 .",
    "next , in order to define a quantitative measure of the semiclassical error , one should establish a _ correspondence _ between the quantal and the semiclassical levels , namely , one should identify the semiclassical counterparts of the exact quantum levels . in classically chaotic systems , for which the gutzwiller trace formula is applicable , the only constant of the motion is the energy .",
    "this is translated into a single `` good '' quantum number in the quantum spectrum , which is the ordinal number of the levels when ordered by their magnitude .",
    "thus , the only correspondence which can be established between the exact spectrum @xmath24 and its semiclassical approximation , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 this is to be contrasted with integrable systems , where it is appropriate to compare the exact and approximate levels which have the same quantum numbers .",
    "the scale on which the accuracy of semiclassical energy levels should be measured depends , in general , on the problem at hand .",
    "the most natural choice , however , is the mean level spacing @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the smooth density of states .",
    "the semiclassical error of the nth level is therefore measured by @xcite : @xmath29 a more useful and significant measure is the average of @xmath30 over an energy interval @xmath31 centered at @xmath32 , which contains a large number of quantum energies , but which must be so small that both the classical dynamics and the mean density of states remain approximately constant .",
    "this energy averaging will be denoted by triangular brackets @xmath33 in the sequel .",
    "if the semiclassical mean density @xmath34 agrees with @xmath28 to a high precision , then obviously @xmath35 . in this case",
    "@xmath36 is not a useful error measure . for billiard systems",
    "this is always the case , since the mean spectral density can be written as an asymptotic series with explicitly known coefficients @xcite . for general systems ,",
    "only the leading weyl term is explicitly known .",
    "two appropriate measures which are sensitive to the accuracy of the fluctuating parts of the level densities are the mean absolute error : @xmath37 and the variance : @xmath38    having defined the spectral error measures , let us apply them and try to get some estimates of the semiclassical error . in the introductory section we have mentioned the `` traditional '' estimate of the semiclassical error .",
    "gutzwiller @xcite shows , based on pauli @xcite , that the inherent error in the semiclassical ( van - vleck ) approximation of the quantal time propagator scales like @xmath7 . since the energy levels are the temporal fourier components of the propagator , it is plausible to assume that they have the same degree of accuracy : @xmath39 ( strictly speaking , this is an upper bound . )",
    "the mean density of energy levels , for a general @xmath2-dimensional system is asymptotically given by weyl s formula @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the measure of the energy surface in the classical phase space .",
    "hence , @xmath42 that is , the semiclassical approximation is ( marginally ) accurate in 2 dimensions , but it fails to predict accurate energy levels for 3 dimensions or more .",
    "one may get a different estimate of the semiclassical error , if the gutzwiller trace formula ( gtf ) is used as a starting point .",
    "suppose that we have calculated @xmath17 to a certain degree of precision , and we compute from it the semiclassical energies using ( [ eq : scqc ] ) .",
    "the quality of this approximation can be estimated if the leading corrections @xmath43 are also included and the resulting energy differences @xmath44 are evaluated .",
    "we thus need to consider : @xmath45 combining ( [ eq : scqc ] ) and ( [ eq : impscqc ] ) we get to first order in @xmath44 : @xmath46 in the above we assumed that the fluctuations of @xmath17 around its average are not very large .",
    "thus , @xmath47    let us apply the above formula and consider the case in which we take for @xmath17 its mean part @xmath48 , and that we include in @xmath48 terms of order up to ( and including ) @xmath49 . for @xmath43",
    "we use both the leading correction to @xmath48 and the leading order periodic orbit sum which is ( formally ) of order @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath51 we conclude , that approximating the energies only by the mean counting function @xmath48 up to ( and not including ) the constant term , is already sufficient to obtain semiclassical energies which are accurate to @xmath52 with respect to the mean density of states .",
    "note again , that no periodic orbits were included in @xmath17 .",
    "including less terms in @xmath48 will lead to a diverging semiclassical error , while more terms will be masked by the periodic orbit ( oscillatory ) term .",
    "one can do even better if one includes in @xmath17 the smooth terms up to and including the constant term ( @xmath53 ) together with the leading order periodic orbit sum which is formally also @xmath53 .",
    "the semiclassical error is then : @xmath54 that is , the semiclassical energies measured in units of the mean level spacing are asymptotically accurate independently of the dimension !",
    "this estimate grossly contradicts the  traditional \" estimate ( [ eq : epstrad ] ) and calls for an explanation .",
    "the first point that should be noted is that the order of magnitude ( power of @xmath11 ) of the periodic orbit sum , which we considered above to be @xmath53 , is only a formal one . indeed ,",
    "each term which is due to a _",
    "single _ periodic orbit is of order @xmath55 .",
    "however the periodic orbit sum _ absolutely diverges _ , and at best it is only _ conditionally convergent_. to give it a numerical meaning , the periodic orbit sum must therefore be regularized .",
    "this is effectively achieved by truncating the trace formula or the corresponding spectral @xmath56 function @xcite",
    ". however , the truncation cutoff itself depends on @xmath11 .",
    "one can conclude , that the simple minded estimate ( [ eq : epsgtf ] ) given above is at best a lower bound , and the error introduced by the periodic orbit sum must be re - evaluated with more care .",
    "this point will be dealt with in great detail in the sequel , and we shall eventually develop a meaningful framework for evaluating the magnitude of the periodic orbit sum .    the connection and the disparity between the  traditional \" estimate of the semiclassical error and the one based on the trace formula can be further illustrated by the following argument .",
    "the periodic orbit formula is derived from the semiclassical propagator @xmath57 using further approximations @xcite .",
    "one thus wonders , how can it be that _ further _ approximations of @xmath57 actually _ reduce _ the semiclassical error from ( [ eq : epstrad ] ) to ( [ eq : epsgtf ] ) ?",
    "the puzzle is resolved if we recall , that in order to obtain @xmath58 above we separated the density of states into a smooth and an oscillating parts , and we required that the smooth part is accurate enough . to achieve this",
    ", we have to go beyond the leading weyl s term and to use specialized methods to calculate the smooth density of states beyond the leading order .",
    "these methods are mostly developed for billiards @xcite . in any case , to obtain @xmath58 we have added an _ additional _ information which goes beyond the leading semiclassical approximation .",
    "a straightforward check of the accuracy of the semiclassical spectrum using the error measures @xmath59 is exceedingly difficult due to the large number of periodic orbits needed because of the exponential proliferation in chaotic systems .",
    "the few cases where such tests were carried out involve 2d systems and it was possible to check only the lowest ( less than a hundred ) levels ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the good agreement between the exact and the semiclassical values confirmed the expectation that in 2d the semiclassical error is small . in 3d ,",
    "the topological entropy is typically much larger @xcite , and the direct test of the semiclassical spectrum becomes prohibitive .",
    "facing with this grim reality , we have to introduce alternative error measures which yield the desired information , but which are more appropriate for a practical calculation .",
    "we construct the measure : @xmath60 as before , the triangular brackets indicate averaging over an energy interval @xmath31 about @xmath32 .",
    "we shall now show that @xmath61 faithfully reflects the deviations between the spectra , and is closely related to @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "note , that the following arguments are purely statistical and apply to every pair of staircase functions .",
    "suppose first , that all the differences @xmath64 are smaller than the mean spacing .",
    "then , @xmath65 is either 0 or 1 ( see figure [ fig : delta2small ] ) and hence @xmath66 however , the right hand side of the above equation ( the fraction of non  zero contributions ) equals @xmath62 .",
    "thus , @xmath67    if , on the other hand , deviations are much larger than one mean spacing , the typical horizontal distance @xmath68 should be comparable to the vertical distance @xmath65 , and hence , in this limit @xmath69 therefore , we expect @xmath70 to interpolate between @xmath62 and @xmath71 throughout the entire range of deviations . this behavior is indeed observed in a numerical test which was performed to check the above expectations .",
    "we considered the unfolded exact spectrum ( normalized to unity mean spacing @xcite ) of the 3d sinai billiard @xmath72 and created from it a synthetic spectrum by adding a random variable with @xmath73 mean and variance @xmath74 : @xmath75 the @xmath76 has also a unity mean spacing and it is meant to imitate a semiclassical spectrum . after sorting @xmath76 we calculated the measures @xmath77 and @xmath70 as functions of @xmath78 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : delta2-eps ] , and they verify the estimates ( [ eq : delta2small ] , [ eq : delta2large ] ) in the appropriate limits .    the numerical test reported in figure [ fig : delta2smootheps2 ] demonstrates another attractive feature of the measure @xmath61 : it is completely equivalent to @xmath71 when the spectral counting functions are replaced by their smooth counterparts , provided that the smoothing width is of the order of 1 mean level spacing and the same smoothing is applied to both counting functions .",
    "that is , @xmath79 for all deviations .",
    "( in fact , for small deviations there is a proportionality factor , but it can be set to 1 if an appropriate smoothing is used . ) in testing the semiclassical accuracy , this kind of smoothing is essential and will be introduced by truncating the trace formula at the heisenberg time @xmath80 .",
    "these properties of the measure @xmath70 , and its complete equivalence to @xmath71 for smooth counting functions , renders it a most appropriate measure of the semiclassical error .",
    "we now turn to the practical evaluation of @xmath70 . to affect the energy averaging , we choose a positive window function @xmath81 which has a width @xmath31 near @xmath32 and is normalized by @xmath82 .",
    "it falls off sufficiently rapidly so that all the expressions which follow are well behaved .",
    "construct the following counting functions that have an effective support on an interval of size @xmath31 about @xmath32 : @xmath83 at this stage @xmath84 and @xmath85 are still sharp staircases , and we note that the multiplication with  @xmath86 preserves the sharpness of the stairs ( it is not a convolution ! ) .",
    "we now explicitly construct @xmath87 as : @xmath88 to construct @xmath89 we need to smooth @xmath90 over a scale of order of one mean spacing .",
    "this can be done e.g.  by replacing the sharp stairs by error functions . as for @xmath91",
    ", we prefer to simply replace it with the original @xmath17 , which we assume to be smooth over one mean spacing .",
    "that is , we suppose that @xmath17 contains periodic orbits up to heisenberg time .",
    "hence , @xmath92 a comment is in order here . strictly speaking , to satisfy ( [ eq : delta2epsilon2 ] ) we need to apply the same smoothing to @xmath18 and to @xmath91 , and in general @xmath93 , but there are differences of order 1 between the two functions .",
    "however , since our goal is to determine whether the semiclassical error remains finite or diverges in the semiclassical limit @xmath94 , we disregard such inaccuracies of order 1 .",
    "if more accurate error measure is needed , then more care should be practiced in this and in the following steps .",
    "applying parseval s theorem to ( [ eq : delta2smoothint ] ) we get : @xmath95 where @xmath96 we shall refer to @xmath97 as the ( regularized ) quantal and semiclassical time spectra , respectively .",
    "this name can be justified by invoking the gutzwiller trace formula and expressing the semiclassical counting function as a mean part plus a sum over periodic orbits .",
    "we have : @xmath98 \\ ,    \\label{eq : gtf}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the semiclassical amplitude of the jth periodic orbit , and @xmath100 are its period , action , maslov index , monodromy and repetition index , respectively .",
    "then , the corresponding time spectrum reads : @xmath101 }       \\hat{w}([t + t_j(e)]/\\hbar ) -     \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\    & &    \\left .",
    "\\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;           \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ;    { \\rm e}^{(i/\\hbar)[e t - s_j(e ) ] }       \\hat{w}([t - t_j(e)]/\\hbar )    \\right\\ } .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , the fourier transform of @xmath86 is denoted by @xmath102 .",
    "it is a localized function of @xmath103 whose width is @xmath104 .",
    "the sum over the periodic orbits in @xmath105 therefore produces sharp peaks centered at times that correspond to the periods @xmath106 , hence the name `` time spectrum '' .",
    "the term @xmath107 corresponds to the smooth part and thus is sharply peaked near @xmath108 . to obtain ( [ eq : scltspt ] ) we expanded the actions near @xmath32 to first order : @xmath109 .",
    "we note in passing , that this approximate expansion of @xmath110 can be avoided altogether if one performs the fourier transform over @xmath111 rather than over the energy .",
    "this way , an action spectrum will emerge , but also here the action resolution will be finite , because the range of @xmath111 should be limited to the range where @xmath112 is approximately constant .",
    "it turns out therefore , that the two approaches are essentially equivalent , and for billiards they are identical .",
    "the manipulations done thus far were purely formal , and did not manifestly circumvent the difficult task of evaluating @xmath113 . however , the introduction of the time spectra and the formula ( [ eq : delta2ls ] ) put us in a better position than with the original expression ( [ eq : delta2int ] ) .",
    "the advantages of using the time spectra in the present context are the following :    * the semiclassical time spectrum @xmath114 is absolutely convergent for all times ( as long as the window function  @xmath86 is well behaved , e.g.  it is a gaussian ) . this statement is correct even if the sum ( [ eq : scltspt ] ) extends over the entire set of periodic orbits !",
    "this is in contrast with the trace formula expression for @xmath17 ( and therefore @xmath115 ) which is absolutely divergent if all of the periodic orbits are included .",
    "* time scale separation : as we noted above , the time spectrum is peaked at times that correspond to periods of the classical periodic orbits .",
    "this allows us to distinguish between various qualitatively different types of contributions to @xmath89 .",
    "we shall now pursue the separation of the time scales in detail .",
    "we first note , that due to @xmath116 being real , there is a @xmath117 symmetry in ( [ eq : delta2ls ] ) and therefore @xmath118 .",
    "we now divide the time axis into four intervals :    @xmath119 : the shortest time scale in our problem is @xmath120 .",
    "the contributions to this time interval are due to the differences between the exact and the semiclassical _ mean _ densities of states .",
    "this is an important observation , since it allows us to distinguish between the two sources of semiclassical error  the error that emerges from the mean densities and the error that originates from the fluctuating part ( periodic orbits ) .",
    "since we are interested only in the semiclassical error that results from the fluctuating part of the spectral density , we shall ignore this regime in the following .",
    ": this is the non  universal regime @xcite , in which periodic orbits are still sparse , and can not be characterized statistically in a significant fashion .",
    "the `` ergodic '' time scale @xmath121 is purely classical and is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath122 : in this time regime periodic orbits are already in the universal regime and are dense enough to justify a statistical approach to their proliferation and stability .",
    "the upper limit of this interval is the heisenberg time @xmath123 , which is the time that is needed to resolve the quantum ( discrete ) nature of a wavepacket with energy concentrated near @xmath32 .",
    "the heisenberg time is `` quantum '' in the sense that it is dependent of @xmath11 : @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 : this is the interval of `` long '' orbits which is effectively truncated from the integration as a result of introducing a smoothing of the quantal and semiclassical counting functions , with a smoothing scale of the order of a mean level spacing .    dividing the integral ( [ eq : delta2ls ] ) according to the above time intervals ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath89 : @xmath126 as explained above , @xmath127 can be ignored due to smoothing on the scale of a mean level spacing .",
    "the integral @xmath128 is to be neglected for the following reason .",
    "the integral extends over a time interval which is finite and independent of @xmath11 , and therefore it contains a fixed number of periodic orbits contributions .",
    "the semiclassical approximation provides , for each individual contribution , the leading order in @xmath11 , and therefore @xcite we should expect : @xmath129 the purpose of this work is to check whether the semiclassical error is finite or divergent as @xmath130 , and to study if the rate of divergence depends on dimensionality . equation ( [ eq : delta2-short ] ) implies that @xmath128 can not affect @xmath70 in the semiclassical limit and we shall neglect it in the following .",
    "we thus remain with a lower bound for our measure : @xmath131 which is going to be our object of interest from now on .    the fact that @xmath132 is extremely large on the classical scale",
    "renders the calculation of all the periodic orbits with periods less than @xmath132 an impossible task .",
    "however , sums over periodic orbits when the period is longer than @xmath121 tend to meaningful limits , and hence , we would like to recast the expression for @xmath133 in the following way .",
    "write @xmath134 as : @xmath135    \\label{eq : ct } \\\\",
    "& \\equiv &    \\frac{2}{\\hbar } \\int_{t_{\\rm erg}}^{t_{\\rm h } } { \\rm d}t \\ ,    \\left\\langle \\left| \\hat{d}(t ) \\right|^2    \\right\\rangle_{t } \\times c(t ) \\\\    & = &    \\int_{t_{\\rm erg}}^{t_{\\rm h } } \\mbox{\\large envelope } \\times    \\mbox{\\large correlation } \\nonumber \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parametric dependence on @xmath32 was omitted for brevity .",
    "the smoothing over @xmath103 is explicitly indicated to emphasize that one may use a statistical interpretation of the terms of the integrand .",
    "this is so because in this domain , the density of periodic orbits is so large , that within a time interval of width @xmath136 there are exponentially many orbits whose contributions are averaged due to the finite resolution .",
    "we note now that we can use the following relation between the time spectrum and the spectral form factor @xmath137 : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the scaled time .",
    "the above form factor is smoothed according to the window function  @xmath86 . hence : @xmath140 for generic chaotic systems we expect that @xmath137 agrees with the results of rmt in the universal regime @xmath141 @xcite , and therefore @xmath142 where @xmath143 for systems which violate time reversal symmetry , and @xmath144 if time reversal symmetry is respected .",
    "this implies that the evaluation of @xmath89 reduces to @xmath145 the dependence on @xmath11 in this expression comes from the lower integration limit which is proportional to @xmath146 as well as from the implicit dependence of the function @xmath147 on @xmath11 .",
    "formula ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) is our main theoretical result .",
    "however , we do not know how to evaluate the correlation function @xmath148 from first principles .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath149 corrections to each of the terms in the semiclassical time spectrum is not sufficient since the resulting series which ought to be summed is not absolutely convergent ( see detailed discussion in section ( [ sec : discussion ] ) ) .",
    "therefore we have to recourse to a numerical analysis , which will be described in the next section .",
    "the numerical approach requires one further approximation , which is imposed by the fact that the number of periodic orbits with @xmath150 is prohibitively large .",
    "we had to limit the data base of periodic orbit to the domain @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "the time @xmath153 has no physical origin , and it represents only the limits of our computational resources . using the available numerical data we were able to compute @xmath154 numerically for all @xmath155 and we then _ extrapolated _ it to the entire domain of interest .",
    "we consider this extrapolation procedure to be the main source of uncertainty .",
    "however , since the extrapolation is carried out in the _ universal _ regime , it should be valid if there are no other time scales between @xmath121 and @xmath132 .",
    "we used the formalism and definitions presented above to check the accuracy of the semiclassical spectra of the 2d and 3d sinai billiards .",
    "the most important ingredient in this numerical study is that we could apply the _ same _ analysis to the two systems , and by comparing them to give a reliable answer to the main question posed in this work , namely , how does the semiclassical accuracy depend on dimensionality .",
    "the classical dynamics in billiards depends trivially on the energy ( velocity ) , and therefore the relevant parameter is the length rather than the period of the periodic orbits . because of the same reason , the quantum wavenumbers @xmath156 are the relevant variables in the quantum description . from now on we shall use the variables @xmath157 instead of @xmath158 , and use `` length spectra '' rather than `` time spectra '' .",
    "the semiclassical limit is obtained for @xmath159 and @xmath160 is equivalent to @xmath161 .",
    "note also that for a billiard @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a proportional to the billiard s volume .",
    "the numerical work is based on the quantum spectra and on the classical periodic orbits which were calculated by schanz and smilansky @xcite for the 2d billiard , and by primack and smilansky @xcite for the 3d billiard .",
    "the numerical methods and the checks performed to ensure that the quantum and the classical data bases are accurate , complete and immaculate are discussed in the papers cited above .",
    "we start with the 2d sinai billiard , which is the free space between a square of edge @xmath164 and an inscribed disc of radius @xmath165 , with @xmath166 . in our case we used @xmath167 and @xmath168 and considered the quarter desymmetrized billiard ( see figure [ fig : sb2d - sb3d ] ) with dirichlet boundary conditions for the quantum calculations .",
    "the quantal data base consisted of the lowest 27645 eigenvalues in the range @xmath169 , with eigenstates which are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to reflection on the main diagonal .",
    "the classical data base consisted of the shortest 20273 periodic orbits ( including time reversal , reflection symmetries and repetitions ) in the length range @xmath170 . for each orbit ,",
    "the length , the stability determinant and the reflection phase were recorded .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we begin the numerical analysis of the 2d sinai billiard by numerically demonstrating the correctness of equation ( [ eq : delta2-short ] ) .",
    "that is , that for each _ individual _ periodic orbit , the semiclassical error indeed vanishes in the semiclassical limit . in figure",
    "[ fig : sb2d - qm - sc ] we plot @xmath171 for @xmath172 as a function of @xmath173 .",
    "this length corresponds to the shortest periodic orbit , that is , the one that runs along the edges that connect the circle with the outer square . for @xmath105 we used the gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "as is clearly seen from the figure , the quantal ",
    "semiclassical difference indeed vanishes ( approximately as @xmath174 ) , in accordance with ( [ eq : delta2-short ] ) .",
    "we emphasize again , that this behavior does not imply that @xmath70 vanishes in the semiclassical limit , since the number of terms depends on @xmath173 .",
    "it implies _ only _ that @xmath128 vanishes in the limit , since it consists of a fixed and finite number of periodic orbit contributions .",
    "we should also comment that ( non  generic ) penumbra corrections to individual grazing orbits introduce errors which are of order @xmath175 with @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "however , since the definition of `` grazing '' is in itself @xmath173 dependent , one can safely neglect penumbra corrections in estimating the large @xmath173 behavior of @xmath128 .",
    "we now turn to the main body of the analysis , which is the evaluation of @xmath133 for the 2d sinai billiard . based on the available data sets , we plot in figure [ fig : dcxavg.2 ] the function @xmath177 in the interval @xmath178 for various values of @xmath173 .",
    "one can observe , that as a function of @xmath179 the functions @xmath177 fluctuate in the interval for which numerical data were available , without exhibiting any systematic mean trend to increase or to decrease .",
    "we therefore approximate @xmath177 by @xmath180 according to the discussion in section [ sec : accuracy - measures ] we extrapolate this formula in @xmath179 up to the heisenberg length @xmath181 and using ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) we obtain : @xmath182 the last equality is due to @xmath183 . to evaluate @xmath184 we averaged @xmath177 over the interval @xmath185 and",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : dcavg.2 ] .",
    "we choose @xmath186 because the density of periodic orbits is already large for this length ( see figure [ fig : dcxavg.2 ] ) and we expect universal behavior of the periodic orbits .",
    "( for the sinai billiard described by flow the approach to the invariant measure is algebraic rather than exponential @xcite , and thus one can not have a well - defined @xmath187 . an any rate , the specific choice of @xmath187 did not affect the results in any appreciable way . ) inspecting @xmath184 , it is difficult to arrive at firm conclusions , since it seems to fluctuate around a constant value up to @xmath188 and then to decline .",
    "if we approximate @xmath184 by a constant , we get a `` pessimistic '' value of @xmath70 : @xmath189 while if we assume that @xmath184 decays as a power - law , @xmath190 , then @xmath191 collecting the two bounds we get : @xmath192 our estimates for the 2d sinai billiard can be summarized by saying that the semiclassical error diverges no worse than logarithmically ( meaning , very mildly ) .",
    "it may well happen that the semiclassical error is constant or even vanishes in the semiclassical limit . to reach a conclusive answer one should invest exponentially larger amount of numerical work .",
    "there are a few comments in order here .",
    "firstly , the quarter desymmetrization of the 2d sinai billiard does not exhaust its symmetry group , and in fact , a reflection symmetry around the diagonal of the square remains .",
    "this means , that the spectrum of the quarter 2d sinai billiard is composed of two independent spectra , which differ by their parity with respect to the diagonal .",
    "if we assume that the semiclassical deviations of the two spectra are not correlated , the above measure is the sum of the two independent measures .",
    "it is plausible to assume also that both spectra have roughly the same semiclassical deviation , and thus @xmath193 is twice the semiclassical deviation of each of the spectra .",
    "secondly , we recall that the 2d sinai billiard contains `` bouncing  ball '' families of neutrally stable periodic orbits @xcite . we have subtracted their leading - order contribution from @xmath194 such that it includes ( to leading order ) only contributions from generic , isolated and unstable periodic orbits .",
    "this is done since we would like to deduce from the 2d sinai billiard on the 2d generic case in which the bouncing  balls are not present .",
    "( in the sinai billiard , which is concave , there are also diffraction effects @xcite , but we did not treat them here . )",
    "thirdly , the variant of ( [ eq : dtktau ] ) for billiards reads : @xmath195 when @xmath196 . in figure",
    "[ fig : dikt.2 ] we demonstrate the compliance of the form factor with rmt goe using the integrated version of the above relation , and taking into account the presence of two independent spectra .",
    "fourthly , it is interesting to know the actual numerical values of @xmath197 for the @xmath173 values that we considered .",
    "we carried out the computation , and the results are presented in figure [ fig : ddelta2.2 ] .",
    "it is interesting to observe , that for the entire range we have @xmath198 , which is very encouraging from an `` engineering '' point of view .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the 3d sinai billiard .",
    "the billiard is the free space between a cube of edge @xmath164 and an inscribed sphere of radius @xmath165 , where @xmath199 ( see figure [ fig : sb2d - sb3d ] ) .",
    "we used @xmath167 and @xmath200 and desymmetrized the billiard to the fundamental element ( 1/48 of the original one ) .",
    "we calculated the lowest 6697 quantum levels in the interval @xmath201 and the shortest 586965 periodic orbits with length @xmath170 ( the number includes repetitions and time  reversal conjugates ) .    to treat the 3d sinai billiard we need to somewhat modify",
    "the formalism which was presented in the previous section .",
    "this is due to the fact that in 3d the contributions of the various non ",
    "generic bouncing ",
    "ball manifolds overwhelm the spectrum @xcite . since our goal is to give an indication of the semiclassical error in generic systems , it is imperative to get rid of this very strong non  generic effect .",
    "the bouncing ball amplitudes are @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the dimensionality of bouncing  ball manifold in configuration space . in 3d @xmath204 typically , which completely overwhelms the contributions from isolated periodic orbits whose amplitude is @xmath205 .",
    "even the diffraction corrections to the bouncing ",
    "ball amplitudes in 3d increase as @xmath206 with @xmath207 .",
    "in contrast with the 2d case , however , it is difficult to subtract the bouncing  ball contributions analytically for two main reasons .",
    "first , there are always infinitely many bouncing  ball primitive families in the 3d case , while in 2d there is only a finite number .",
    "indeed , in any finite length interval there exists only a finite number of bouncing ball lengths , however their number for billiards in 3d exceeds by far the corresponding number for billiards in 2d .",
    "second , the semiclassical amplitudes of the bouncing ",
    "balls are proportional to their volume in configuration space , and it is difficult in general to calculate it analytically .",
    "thus , to overcome these difficulties we had to device a special method to cleanse the spectrum from the effect of the bouncing  balls and from the leading diffractive corrections .",
    "this method relies on the sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the boundary condition and it is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we shall briefly describe the essence of the method .",
    "the most general (  mixed \" ) boundary conditions under which the quantum billiard problem is self  adjoint can be written as @xcite : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the normal pointing outside of the billiard , the angle @xmath210 interpolates smoothly between dirichlet ( @xmath211 ) and neumann ( @xmath212 ) cases and @xmath213 has the dimension of a wavenumber .",
    "note that @xmath210 and @xmath213 can be different for different parts of the boundary .",
    "the spectrum depends parametrically on the boundary parameters , @xmath214 , and thus we can define the counting function @xmath215 . in @xcite",
    "we discussed the 2d and 3d sinai billiards , and showed that if we choose dirichlet boundary conditions on all the billiard boundaries _ excluding _ the circle ( sphere ) , and set @xmath216 on the circle ( sphere ) then the quantity @xmath217 is to a large extent free of the effects of the bouncing  balls . in the above @xmath218 which are the dirichlet  everywhere eigenvalues .",
    "the corresponding semiclassical trace formula reads @xcite : @xmath219 where @xmath220 in the above @xmath221 is the number of collisions with the circle ( sphere ) of the jth periodic orbit , and @xmath222 are the angles of incidence on the boundary with respect to the normal .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : dqm - mbc ] ) is a weighted density of states where the standard @xmath223 weights of the @xmath224 functions are replaced by @xmath225 , and ( [ eq : derivmbc ] ) is a weighted trace formula where the standard amplitudes @xmath226 are replaced by @xmath227 .",
    "one can show , that @xmath228 for long enough ( ergodic ) orbits .",
    "we shall use @xmath229 for our purposes as follows . let us consider the weighted counting function : @xmath230 the function @xmath231 is a staircase with stairs of variable height @xmath225 . as was explained above , its advantage over @xmath18 is that it is semiclassically free of bouncing balls effects ( to leading order ) and corresponds only to the generic periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "similarly , we construct from @xmath232 the function @xmath233 . having defined @xmath234",
    ", we proceed in analogy to the dirichlet case .",
    "we form from @xmath235 the functions @xmath236 , respectively , by multiplying with a window function @xmath237 and then construct the measure @xmath70 as in ( [ eq : delta2int ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the normalization of @xmath86 must be modified to account for the  velocities \" @xmath225 such as : @xmath238 the above considerations are meaningful provided that the `` velocities '' @xmath225 are narrowly distributed around a well - defined mean @xmath239 and we consider a small enough @xmath173-interval , such that @xmath239 does not change appreciably within this interval .",
    "otherwise , @xmath70 is greatly affected by the fluctuations of @xmath225 ( which is undesired ) and the meaning of the normalization is questionable .    to demonstrate the utility of the above construction using the mixed boundary conditions , we return to the 2d case .",
    "we set @xmath240 , and note that the spectrum at our disposal for the mixed case was confined only to the interval @xmath241 .",
    "first of all , we want to examine the width of the distribution of the @xmath225 s . in figure",
    "[ fig : q ] we plot the ratio of the standard deviation of @xmath225 to the mean , averaged over the @xmath173-axis using a gaussian window .",
    "we use the same window also in the calculations below .",
    "the observation is that the distribution of @xmath225 is moderately narrow and the width decreases algebraically as @xmath173 increases .",
    "this justifies the use of the mixed boundary conditions as was discussed above .",
    "one also needs to check the validity of ( [ eq : dxkxi ] ) , and indeed we found compliance with goe also for the mixed case ( results not shown ) .",
    "we next compare the functions @xmath242 for both the dirichlet and the mixed boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out , that also in the mixed case the functions @xmath177 ( not shown ) fluctuate in @xmath179 with no special tendency .",
    "the averages @xmath184 for the dirichlet and mixed cases are compared in figure [ fig : dmcavg.2 ] .",
    "the values in the mixed case are systematically smaller than in the dirichlet case which is explained by the efficient filtering of tangent and close to tangent orbits that are vulnerable to large diffraction corrections @xcite . however , from @xmath243 on the two graphs show the same trends , and the values of @xmath244 in both cases are of the same magnitude .",
    "thus , the qualitative behavior of @xmath113 is shown to be equivalent in the dirichlet and mixed cases , which gives us confidence in using @xmath245 together with the mixed boundary conditions procedure .",
    "we finally applied the mixed boundary conditions procedure to compute @xmath89 for the desymmetrized 3d sinai with @xmath246 and set @xmath247 .",
    "we first verified that also in the 3d case the velocities @xmath225 have narrow distribution  see figure [ fig : q ] .",
    "next , we examined equation ( [ eq : dxkxi ] ) using quantal data , and discovered that there are deviations form goe ( figure [ fig : mikt.3 ] ) .",
    "we have yet no satisfactory explanation of these deviations , but we suspect that they are caused because the ergodic limit is not yet reached for the length regime under consideration due to the effects of the infinite horizon which are more acute in 3d .",
    "nevertheless , from observing the figure as well as suggested by semiclassical arguments , it is plausible to assume that @xmath248 for small @xmath249 .",
    "hence , this deviation should not have any qualitative effect on @xmath70 according to ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) .",
    "similarly to the 2d case , the behavior of the function @xmath177 is fluctuative in @xmath179 , with no special tendency ( figure [ fig : mcxavg.3 ] ) .",
    "if we average @xmath177 over the universal interval @xmath250 , we obtain @xmath184 which is shown in figure [ fig : mcavg.3 ] .",
    "the averages @xmath184 are fluctuating with a mild decease in @xmath173 , and therefore we can conclude that @xmath251 where the `` optimistic '' measure ( leftmost term ) corresponds to @xmath252 , and the `` pessimistic '' one ( rightmost term ) is due to @xmath253 . in other words , the error estimates ( [ eq : delta2 - 2d ] , [ eq : delta2 - 3d ] ) for the 2d and the 3d cases , respectively , are the same , and in sharp contrast to the `` traditional '' error estimate which predicts that the errors should be different by a factor @xmath254 . on the basis of our numerical data , and in spite of the uncertainties which were clearly delineated , we can safely exclude the  traditional \" error estimate .",
    "our main finding was that the upper bound on the semiclassical error is a logarithmic divergence , which is independent of the dimension ( equations ( [ eq : delta2 - 2d ] ) , ( [ eq : delta2 - 3d ] ) ) . in this respect , there are a few points which deserve discussion .    to begin , we shall try to evaluate @xmath89 using the explicit expressions for the leading corrections to the semiclassical counting function of 2d generic billiard system , as derived by alonso and gaspard @xcite : @xmath255\\ ] ] where @xmath226 are the standard semiclassical amplitudes ( see ( [ eq : gtf ] ) ) , @xmath256 are the lengths of periodic orbits and @xmath257 are the @xmath173-independent amplitudes of the @xmath258 corrections .",
    "the @xmath257 s are given in @xcite .",
    "we ignored in the above equation the case of odd maslov indices .",
    "if we calculate from @xmath259 the corresponding length spectrum @xmath260 using a ( normalized ) gaussian window @xmath261{\\pi \\sigma^2 } ) \\exp [ -(k'-k)^2/(2 \\sigma^2 ) ] $ ] , we obtain : @xmath262{\\pi } }    \\sum_j \\frac{a_j}{l_j }    \\left [      { \\rm e}^{i k ( l - l_j ) - i \\frac{q_j}{k } }      { \\rm e}^{-(l - l_j)^2 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 } } -      { \\rm e}^{i k ( l + l_j ) + i \\frac{q_j}{k } }      { \\rm e}^{-(l + l_j)^2 \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 } }    \\right ] .\\ ] ] in the above we regarded the phase @xmath263 as slowly varying .",
    "the results of alonso and gaspard @xcite suggest that the @xmath257 are approximately proportional to the length of the corresponding periodic orbits : @xmath264 we can therefore well ",
    "approximate @xmath194 as : @xmath265{\\pi } } { \\rm e}^{-i q",
    "l / k }    \\sum_j \\frac{a_j}{l_j } \\left [ \\cdots \\right ] =    { \\rm e}^{- i q l / k } \\hat{d}_{\\rm sc - gtf } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] where @xmath266 is the length spectrum which corresponds to the semiclassical gutzwiller trace formula for the counting function ( without @xmath258 corrections ) .",
    "we are now in a position to evaluate the semiclassical error , indeed : @xmath267 if we now use equation ( [ eq : dxkxi ] ) and @xmath268 ( which is valid for @xmath269 for chaotic systems ) , we get : @xmath270 for @xmath159 we have that @xmath271 which is negligible , hence we can replace the lower limit in ( [ eq : delta2-analytical1 ] ) with 0 : @xmath272 this is the required expression .",
    "the dimensionality enter in @xmath273 only through the power of @xmath173 in @xmath274 .",
    "let us apply equation ( [ eq : delta2-analytical2 ] ) to 2d and 3d cases .",
    "for 2d we have that @xmath275 in leading order , where @xmath163 is the billiard s area , thus , @xmath276 which means , that the semiclassical error in 2d billiards is of the order of the mean spacing , and therefore the semiclassical trace formula is ( marginally ) accurate and meaningful .",
    "this is compatible with our numerical findings within the limitations of the numerical fluctuations .    for 3d , the coefficients @xmath257",
    "were not obtained explicitly , but we shall assume that they are still proportional to @xmath256 ( equation  ( [ eq : mj - lj ] ) ) and thus that ( [ eq : delta2-analytical2 ] ) holds . for 3d billiards @xmath277 to leading order , where @xmath278 is the billiard s volume .",
    "thus the upper limit in ( [ eq : delta2-analytical2 ] ) is @xmath279 which is large in the semiclassical limit . in that case",
    ", we can replace @xmath280 with its mean value @xmath281 and the integrand becomes essentially @xmath282 which results in : @xmath283 that is , in contrast to the 2d case , the semiclassical error diverges logarithmically and the semiclassical trace formula becomes meaningless as far as the prediction of individual levels is concerned .",
    "this is compatible with our numerical results within the numerical dispersion .",
    "however , it relies heavily on the assumption that @xmath284 , for which we can offer no justification .",
    "we note in passing , that the logarithmic divergence persists also for @xmath285 .",
    "another interesting point relates to integrable systems .",
    "it can happen , that for an integrable system it is either difficult or impossible to express the hamiltonian as an explicit function of the action variables . in that case",
    ", we can not assign to the levels other quantum numbers than their ordinal number , and the semiclassical error can be estimated using @xmath70 . however , since for integrable systems @xmath286 , we get that : @xmath287 therefore , for deviations which are comparable to the chaotic cases , @xmath288 , we get @xmath289 which is much larger than for the chaotic case and diverges for @xmath290 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) for the semiclassical error contains semiclassical information in two respects . obviously , @xmath148 , which is the difference between the quantal and the semiclassical length spectra contains semiclassical information .",
    "but also , the fact that the lower limit of the integral in ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) is finite is a consequence of semiclassical analysis . if this lower limit is replaced by @xmath73 , the integral diverges for finite values of @xmath11 , which is meaningless",
    "therefore , the fact that the integral has a lower cutoff , or rather , that @xmath291 is exactly @xmath73 below the shortest period , is a crucial semiclassical ingredient in our analysis .",
    "finally , we consider the case in which the semiclassical error is estimated with no periodic orbits taken into account .",
    "that is , we want to calculate @xmath292 which is the number variance @xmath293 for the large argument @xmath294 .",
    "this implies @xmath295 , and using ( [ eq : delta2final ] ) we get that @xmath296 , which in the semiclassical limit becomes @xmath297 .",
    "this result is fully consistent and compatible with previous results for the asymptotic ( saturation ) value of the number variance @xmath298 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it implies also that the pessimistic error bound ( [ eq : delta2-pessimistic ] ) is of the same magnitude as if periodic orbits were not taken into account at all .",
    "( periodic orbits improve , however , quantitatively , since in all cases we obtained @xmath299 . )",
    "thus , if we assume that periodic orbit contributions do not make @xmath300 worse than @xmath301 , then the pessimistic error bound @xmath302 is the _ maximal _ one in any dimension @xmath2 .",
    "this excludes , in particular , algebraic semiclassical errors , and thus refutes the traditional estimate @xmath303 .",
