    "spinel compounds with the generic formula @xmath3 crystallize in the cubic space group @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 sites can accomodate a magnetic ion , in this case @xmath6 .",
    "they form a pyrochlore lattice , a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra , that is the archetype of geometrical frustration .",
    "in addition , they combine magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom , which confer them a magnetostructural flexibility in zero and finite magnetic field .",
    "the interplay between magnetic frustration and magnetoelastic coupling has been intensively studied in spinels with , for instance , either v@xmath7 or cr@xmath7 on the @xmath5 site and various ions on the @xmath8 site ( hg , mg , cd and zn ) @xcite . in these systems , at the nel temperature ( t@xmath9 ) , a transition to an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering is accompanied by a cubic to tetragonal or orthorhombic structural distortion .",
    "it is interpreted as a 3-dimensional spin - peierls transition acting to reduce the frustration @xcite . in the cr compounds ,",
    "when applying a magnetic field , a magnetization plateau at half of the saturation magnetization is stabilized by the spin - lattice coupling on a wide range of fields @xcite . moreover",
    ", the beginning of the plateau coincides with a structural distortion .",
    "it corresponds to a recovery of the cubic structure as a consequence of the release of the frustration by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "ge spinels , with ni@xmath2 or co@xmath2 on the pyrochlore lattice , have comparable rich phase diagrams but have been less studied because the frustration effects are not as straightforward , in particular not solely driven by the first neighbor interactions .",
    "they were both shown , by powder neutron diffraction , to order in a magnetic structure characterized by a propagation vector @xmath10=(1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) stabilized through competing interactions beyond the third neighbors @xcite .",
    "the magnetic arrangement was described assuming a single propagation vector ( single-@xmath10 structure ) as follows : alternating kagome ( kgm ) and triangular ( tri ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) planes , perpendicular to the @xmath11111@xmath12 directions associated with the propagation vector , and antiferromagnetically coupled to the nearest planes of the same kind ( see figure [ refin]a ) . in geni@xmath0o@xmath1 , which retains the cubic structure in the magnetic phase ,",
    "both kgm and tri sites are magnetically decoupled , i.e. the molecular field created by the magnetization of one type of site on the other one is zero .",
    "it leads to an independent ordering of the two kinds of planes with distinct transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is at variance with geco@xmath0o@xmath1 in which a unique magnetic transition is observed at t@xmath9=23.5 k. this would be due to a structural distortion , proposed to be cubic - to - tetragonal from powder neutron and x - ray diffraction , which couples the two sites and allows to reduce the frustration in the absence of any external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "besides this zero - field magnetostructural behavior , a complex h - t phase diagram has been observed in geco@xmath0o@xmath1 by magnetization , ultrasound and electron spin resonance measurements , evidencing several field - induced anomalies @xcite .",
    "their microscopic origin was investigated by powder neutron diffraction under magnetic field up to 10 t @xcite .",
    "a transition , observed at @xmath13 4 t , was attributed to an antiferromagnetic - to - ferromagnetic spin rearrangement between the triangular planes while retaining the antiferromagnetic arrangement between the kagome planes .",
    "the final ferromagnetic order of the kagome planes was proposed to occur at the second transition around h=10 t.    we hereafter present the results of single - crystal neutron and synchrotron x - ray diffraction under zero and finite magnetic fields applied along a 2-fold axis of the high temperature cubic structure .",
    "we show in particular that the high field transition , for this orientation of the field , is much more subtle than a plain antiferromagnetic - to - ferromagnet one .",
    "it implies a change of the magnetic anisotropy , a switch of the magnetostructural domains , and the stabilization of a new canted magnetic structure .",
    "we discuss the interplay between magnetostructural effects and frustration in triggering these field - induced unconventional behaviors .",
    "single - crystals of geco@xmath0o@xmath1 with an octahedral shape of approximately 2 mm size were synthesized by chemical vapor transport .",
    "neutron diffraction was carried out at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) , in zero field on the cea - crg d15 diffractometer and under magnetic field up to 12 t , applied along the [ 1 - 10 ] direction of the cube , on the cea - crg d23 diffractometer . an additional diffraction experiment using polarized neutrons and spherical polarization analysis",
    "was performed with the single - crystal installed inside the cryopad device on the cea - crg in22 spectrometer at the ill .",
    "high magnetic field x - ray single - crystal diffraction experiments using synchrotron radiation were performed at the id06 beamline ( esrf ) under magnetic field up to 10 t @xcite .",
    "magnetization measurements on an oriented single - crystal were performed using an extraction magnetometer .       and @xmath14 , the other two ( blue lines ) selected above @xmath14 .",
    "for each @xmath10-domain , the 3 @xmath15-domains are listed for the magnetic moments either along the @xmath11110@xmath12 ( in black ) or along the @xmath11112@xmath12 ( in blue ) directions .",

    "moreover , if the magnetic moments lie in the @xmath21111@xmath22 planes , there are three @xmath15-domains per @xmath10-domain with moment directions rotated by 120@xmath23 between @xmath15-domains @xcite . in zero field , our refinement of the magnetic intensities collected on d15 @xcite confirms the magnetic structure deduced from powder neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "it additionally proves that the tri and kgm magnetic moments lie in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath11111@xmath12 directions given by the propagation vectors . due to the presence of 12 domains that we found approximately equipopulated",
    ", the moment orientation could not be further determined using unpolarized neutrons .",
    "polarized neutrons and spherical polarization analysis allowed us to determine the relative orientation of the magnetic moments on the tri and kgm sites ( but not their absolute direction that was only inferred from neutron scattering under magnetic field , as presented below ) .",
    "the best fit of the measured polarization matrix for 23 reflections is obtained for parallel tri and kgm magnetic moments , as shown in figure [ refin]a @xcite .",

    "we followed four reflections while applying a magnetic field along the 2-fold axis [ 1 - 10 ] direction : ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) , ( 0.5 , 0.5 , -0.5 ) , ( 0.5 , -0.5 , -0.5 ) , ( 0.5 , -0.5 , 0.5 ) .",
    "they are characteristic of the four @xmath10-domain populations and have roughly the same intensity at h=0 . as shown in figure [ magdom]a ,",
    "when increasing the magnetic field , the 4 equipopulated @xmath10-domains start to split into two pairs of reflections with different intensities , one pair being selected ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) whereas the other pair ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) is suppressed with increasing field .",
    "this selection occurs irreversibly mostly below @xmath25 2 t. at @xmath24=4.3 t , there is a slight change of curvature of the field dependence of the ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) and ( 0.5 , 0.5 , -0.5 ) signal .",
    "this field corresponds to the first anomaly observed in the magnetization curve shown in figure [ mag ] , in agreement with the results of hoshi _ et al .",
    "the second magnetization anomaly occurs at @xmath14=9.5 t , when the populations of the four @xmath10-domains change again abruptly in a remarkable way : the two selected domains ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) vanish and the two @xmath10-domains that were absent ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are populated ( see figure [ magdom]a ) .",
    "in addition to the afm components probed with the previous reflections , a gradual rise of the intensity of the ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) nuclear reflection is observed ( see figure [ magdom]b ) .",
    "it is associated with the fm components @xmath26 developing along the field on the tri and kgm sites and leading to the integrated magnetic intensity on the ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) reflection @xmath27 .",
    "two step - like increases of this signal are observed , a small one at @xmath24 and a pronounced one at @xmath14 . above @xmath14 , both a fm and an afm contributions are thus present indicating a canted magnetic structure , consistent with the magnetization still increasing in higher fields @xcite .",
    "direction at 2 k , width=340 ]    the field - induced magnetic orders could be determined from refinements of the magnetic reflections collected on d23 under the selected fields of 5.5 , 9.4 and 12 t @xcite .",
    "the field - induced magnetic behavior is summarized in table [ tabledomain ] . at h=5.5 and 9.4 t ,",
    "i.e. for * h@xmath28@xmath11h@xmath11h@xmath29 * , the kgm afm component of the moments is found aligned along the [ 11 - 2 ] direction for the @xmath17 selected domain ( see figure [ refin]b ) and along the [ 112 ] direction for the @xmath18 selected domain .",
    "the amplitude of this component decreases from 3.1 to 1.8 @xmath30 between 5.5 and 9.4 t while the fm component increases . on the tri site",
    ", the afm component is found equal to zero above @xmath24 , as already proposed @xcite . at h=12 t ,",
    "i.e. * for h@xmath12h@xmath29 * , the kgm afm component of the two new @xmath19 and @xmath20 selected domains is found aligned along a unique direction [ 110 ] , also perpendicular to the applied magnetic field ( see figure [ refin]c ) . at this field , the afm and fm components of the kgm magnetic moment",
    "are found @xmath13 1.5 and 2.4 @xmath30 respectively from neutron and magnetization measurements .",
    "the scenario accounting for the field dependence of the magnetic ordering is thus the following : at zero - field , we assume that both the tri and kgm moments are parallel to each other and along the 12 equivalent @xmath11112@xmath12 directions .",
    "increasing the field applied along [ 1 - 10 ] selects the two [ 11 - 2 ] and [ 112 ] directions perpendicular to it , and thus the two associated @xmath17 and @xmath18 domains .",
    "@xmath24 then marks an afm to fm transition of the tri magnetic moments that become aligned with the field . at @xmath14 , a new magnetic order",
    "is stabilized with the afm component on the kgm sites aligned along the [ 110 ] direction .",

    "a ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) propagation vector for the magnetic structure is not compatible with the tetragonal symmetry in a single-@xmath10 picture .",
    "a fundamental question is therefore whether the magnetic order is described by only one or several members of the star of the @xmath10-vector .",
    "a similar puzzling behavior was reported in coo : this oxide was known to undergo a cubic - to - tetragonal structural transition at the temperature of the collinear magnetic ordering , itself described by an afm stacking of ferromagnetic planes with a ( 1/2 , 1/2 , 1/2 ) propagation vector and the magnetic moment along the @xmath11112@xmath12 directions @xcite .",
    "symmetry arguments @xcite were invoked showing that the tetragonal distortion actually implies a magnetic structure described by 4 propagation vectors , leading to a non - collinear magnetic structure . on the other hand ,",
    "a single-@xmath10 magnetic structure could be restored when an additional small trigonal distortion superimposes the main tetragonal one , leading to a monoclinic space group . in coo ,",
    "the evolution of the magnetic domains under applied stress allowed to discriminate between the two scenarios , in favor of a single-@xmath10 structure @xcite .",
    "a direct evidence of a small but finite trigonal lattice distortion was finally found @xcite , which agrees with the magnetic structure symmetry .",
    "last , coexisting with the main magnetic order , a weak additional antiferromagnetic contribution with a tetragonal propagation vector ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) was evidenced , consistent with the main structural distortion @xcite . in analogy with coo",
    ", we propose that geco@xmath0o@xmath1 enters a single-@xmath10 magnetic order below t@xmath9 , compatible with a weak trigonal distortion added to the major tetragonal distortion of the paramagnetic cubic space group .",
    "this assumption is supported by the evolution of the magnetic domain population under magnetic field , as described in the main article . also supporting this assumption is the orientation of the co@xmath2 magnetic moments that we determined along the same direction as in coo .",
