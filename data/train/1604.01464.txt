    "radio ( cr ) system is known as one of the promising techniques to meet the ever - increasing demand on spectrum efficiency ( se ) in the future wireless systems @xcite .",
    "depending on spectrum sharing strategies , there are generally two operation modes in cr systems .",
    "one is overlay mode , where the transmission in secondary system is enabled only when primary system is not on transmission @xcite .",
    "the other is underlay mode , where the transmission in secondary system is enabled if the interference to primary system can be tolerated @xcite .",
    "compared to the overlay mode , the underlay mode has more potential in improving the se as it allows more chances for simultaneous cognitive transmissions @xcite .",
    "thus this work focuses on the underlay mode for cr system .    among all , the cr system with multiple antennas at the secondary transmitter ( st ) is capable of applying the beamforming at the st to improve the secondary transmission while protecting the primary users ( pu ) @xcite . in these cr systems , the channel direction information from the st to the pu ( cdisp )",
    "must be acquired at the st to assist the beamforming , and the acquisition of cdisp results in additional signaling overhead between the primary and secondary systems .    to reduce the signaling overhead for the cdisp in cr system ,",
    "limited feedback techniques have been proposed , where the cdisp is quantized at the pu and fed back to the st @xcite .",
    "the obtained cdisp at the st is imperfect because of the quantization , and thus the interference is residual to the pu that can not be completely nulled after the beamforming . theoretically , allocating more feedback bits for each pu can provide more accurate cdisp and reduce the residual interference , which is however constrained by the finite feedback capacity between primary and secondary systems @xcite . to avoid the severe interference for the pu , it is important to minimize the maximum interference in primary system caused by the st .    in this letter ,",
    "we study the problem of allocating the feedback bits among multiple pus to minimize the maximum interference caused by the st in limited feedback cr system .",
    "we also minimize the total feedback bits budget under a predefined interference threshold at the pus .",
    "for both two problems , the solutions are provided in closed - form and of low complexity .",
    "notation : we use @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 to denote the absolute value , the hermitian operator and the expectation operator , respectively .",
    "consider the st equipped with a number of @xmath3 antennas serves a secondary user ( su ) by beamforming while mitigating the interferences to a number of @xmath4 pus in the primary system .",
    "the received instantaneous interference at the pu @xmath5 from the st is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponds respectively to the average channel gain and instantaneous channel vector from the st to pu @xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the unit - norm beamformer and data symbol at the st for the su .",
    "we assume the channel vectors @xmath9 are subject to identically independent distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "flat rayleigh fading , and the pus have perfect channel information about @xmath9 after the channel estimation .",
    "denote the perfect cdisp as @xmath12 , which is unit norm and conveys only channel direction information @xcite . in the limited feedback literature @xcite , the cdisp is firstly quantized through a given codebook with a proper size at each pu , and",
    "then the bits for the quantized cdisp are fed back to the st for beamforming .",
    "there are many protocols to support forwarding the cdisp from the primary system to the secondary system , e.g. , the s1 protocol in @xcite when primary and secondary systems are deployed in macro and pico cells , respectively .",
    "let @xmath13 be the quantized version of @xmath14 .",
    "the relation between perfect cdisp and quantized cdisp is given as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the quantization error vector , and @xmath17 reflects the accuracy of cdisp received at the st .",
    "the average cdisp distortion due to quantization is defined as @xcite @xmath18 the value of @xmath19 depends on the employed codebooks . for the tractability",
    ", we apply the quantization upper bound method introduced in @xcite , which assumes each quantization cell is a voronoi region of a small spherical cap . from eq .",
    "( 13 ) of @xcite , we find the average quantization error as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of bits allocated to user @xmath5 for quantizing its cdisp @xmath14 .",
    "the work in @xcite demonstrates via simulation that provides a good approximation for any other codebooks designed for i.i.d .",
    "flat rayleigh channels .    as in most limited feedback literature @xcite",
    ", we consider the zeroforcing ( zf ) beamforming is applied at the st to reduce the interference into the primary system , i.e. , the beamforming vector is selected such that @xmath22 for all @xmath5 under perfect cdisp . denoting @xmath23 as the channel vector from the st to the su ,",
    "one well - known zf beamforming scheme is from the pseudo - inverse by normalizing the first column of the matrix @xmath24^{-1}$ ] where @xmath25 $ ] . under limited feedback , although the interference can not be nulled completely due to imperfect cdisp , the zf beamforming has the merit of simplicity and robustness to imperfect cdisp . in zf scheme , when the elements in @xmath26 are i.i .",
    "d. with a unit variance , it is shown in @xcite , @xmath27 then the average interference from the st to the pu @xmath5 under limited feedback becomes @xmath28 where the transmit power at the st is @xmath29 .",
    "observing , allocating more feedback bits to the pu @xmath5 reduces its residual interference from the st . yet",
    "the feedback capacity from the primary system to secondary system is usually finite and shared among the users .",
    "the interferences in are linear with average channel gains @xmath8 , which are heterogenous for individual pus . to avoid the severe interference to primary system",
    ", it is necessary to allocate the total available feedback bits among multiple pus by considering the heterogeneity of average channel gains @xmath8 .    motivated by this",
    ", the problem of allocating feedback bits among multiple pus to minimize the maximum interference in limited feedback cr system under the sum - bit constraint can be described as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of feedback bits for all @xmath4 pus in the available feedback capacity from the primary system to the secondary system .",
    "the problem in is convex after relaxing the integers @xmath21 into the continuous variables , since the second - order derivative of the objective function @xmath32 with regard to @xmath21 is positive and the constraints in and are linear .",
    "then , the problem in can be solved via standard convex optimization tools @xcite . after obtaining the optimal solution to",
    ", the allocation results can be rounded into nearest integers as the number of bits allocated for each pu @xcite .    to provide an explicit solution with low complexity for the bit allocation in ,",
    "we further consider a suboptimal problem .",
    "inspired by the equation @xmath33 we try to optimize the new objective @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 under a sufficiently large positive integer @xmath36 .",
    "then the new optimization problem becomes @xmath37 the problem in is identical to that in when @xmath36 approaches infinity as guaranteed by .",
    "however , under a finite @xmath36 , the problem in is suboptimal to that in since @xmath38 always holds .",
    "the problem in is still convex , since @xmath36 is a constant and the inside term @xmath32 is convex on @xmath21 .",
    "the lagrangian function of the problem in is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the lagrangian multiplier .",
    "thus , the optimal solution to the problem should satisfy the karush - kuhun - tucker ( kkt ) conditions @xmath41 where @xmath42 . by introducing a new positive parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "the kkt conditions can be written more concisely as @xmath44^\\dagger,\\label{bar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 should satisfy @xmath46 , and @xmath47^\\dagger=\\max\\{0,x\\}$ ] . from , it is clear that the optimal solution to the problem allocates more bits to quantize the cdisp from the pu who has a larger average channel gain @xmath48 .",
    "it is known that the solution satisfying can be found by the standard water - filling algorithm @xcite , which can be implemented with one - dimensional search over @xmath49 and converges very fast with less than @xmath4 iterations .",
    "after @xmath49 is found , the bit allocation results can be immediately obtained from , which only need regular scalar operations .",
    "therefore , the computational complexity of the solution to is reduced from the solution of standard optimization tools to . the solution to can serve as the performance upper bound for any bit allocation to minimize the maximum interference in limited feedback cr system . in practice",
    ", the suboptimal solution in may be more desirable for cr system which is sensitive to the computational complexity . note that although the optimal setting @xmath36 should be infinity , it is sufficient to set a finite large @xmath36 in the optimization for achieving a good result in practice as shown in the simulation section .",
    "the suboptimal problem in allows us to obtain the relationship between the minimized maximum interference and the number of total feedback bits under asymptotical analysis . to see this ,",
    "we consider that the total number feedback bits @xmath31 is large such that the operation @xmath50^\\dagger$ ] can be removed in . in this case",
    ", it can be verified that the solution in achieves the same optimization result as the algorithmic inequality @xmath51 given by @xmath52 where the last equality is led by @xmath53 under the sum - bit constraint that @xmath46 .    since the problem in and are identical when @xmath36 approaches infinity , by using @xmath54 , the optimized maximum interference in under a large total number of feedback bits @xmath31 satisfies @xmath55 which is linear with the geometric mean of the average channel gains among the pus , and degrades exponentially as the number of antenna @xmath3 increases .",
    "another challenge in the design for cr systems is to guarantee that interferences at the pus caused by the st is restricted to below a predefined interference threshold , @xmath56 .    in such systems , it is more desirable to minimize the total required feedback bits such that the interference to each pu is below a given threshold . the corresponding feedback bits budget optimization problem can be modeled as @xmath57    the above problem can be solved easily . to satisfy the constraints in and , according to and",

    "the proposed bit allocation solutions are evaluated with simulations .",
    "we consider the case of three pus in the primary system , i.e. , @xmath61 .",
    "the average channel gains from the st to three pus are respectively @xmath62 , and the transmit power at the st is set as @xmath63 . the codebooks for quantizing the cdis",
    "are adopted as given in @xcite .     under @xmath64 . ]     under different average channel gain . ]",

    "are investigated , and both the rounded and unrounded results are provided . as shown in the figure , we can find that the proposed suboptimal solution has almost the same performances as the optimal one for both rounded and unrounded cases .",
    "the minimized maximum interference drops to zero as the total number of feedback bits increases , while the descending rate is dominated by the number of antennas @xmath3 at the st as indicated by the result in .",
