    "following the demonstration in @xcite that quantum hall ferromagnets contain skyrmions in their quasiparticle spectra , there has been a great deal of work on spin textures in quantum hall systems .",
    "this work has received considerable impetus from a set of experiments @xcite that have adduced evidence for skyrmions being the lowest energy quasiparticles at @xmath0 as well as for their _ not _ being so at @xmath1 and higher odd integer fillings @xcite .",
    "the skyrmions themselves have been investigated by several authors @xcite and a skyrme crystal phase has been studied @xcite with a recent experiment appearing to find a transition into it at a finite temperature @xcite . in addition , textured quasiparticles have been discussed in the context of double layer systems @xcite and invoked in explaining a novel phase transition in the latter @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that ferromagnetic quantum hall states can exhibit textured edges @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite was based on a long wavelength effective action for the spin dynamics , supplemented by a charge density - topological density constraint , that allowed an analytic computation of the properties of the skyrmions in the limit of small zeeman energies .",
    "no details of this computation were given there and one of the purposes of this paper is to provide them .",
    "a second is to report numerical studies of the effective action , that have a region of validity beyond the analytic approximations , and compare extremely well with those using the hartree - fock technique of fertig _ et .",
    "we also report here on the details of effective action studies of the textured edges mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we note that the numerical studies have been described previously in a thesis by one of us @xcite and are being reported here for ease of access . in the interim , effective action results on skyrmion properties have been reported by abolfath _",

    "in the long wavelength limit , the spin degree of freedom of a quantum hall ( qh ) ferromagnet is described by a unit vector @xmath3 .",
    "a distinguishing feature of qh ferromagnets is that the topological density of the spin field , @xmath4 , is proportional to the deviation of the charge density , @xmath5 , from its background value , @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "( @xmath8 is the filling factor of the ferromagnetic component of the qh liquid ( _ e.g. _ @xmath9 at @xmath1 ) , and @xmath10 is the magnetic length . ) this enables one to formally integrate out the dynamics of the charge and obtain an effective lagrangian for the system in terms of the spin field alone whose coefficients can be fixed using known long wavelength quantities @xcite : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the vector potential of a unit magnetic monopole , @xmath13 is the spin stiffness @xcite and @xmath14 the dielectric constant of the background semiconductor .",

    "( [ leff ] ) . in the following",
    "we will measure all energies in units of @xmath22 and lengths in units of @xmath23 .    for finite energy configurations",
    ", the finiteness of the gradient term requires that the field approach a common value at infinity regardless of direction . in such cases ,",
    "the plane can be compactified to a sphere and @xmath3 gives a map from @xmath24 ( the compactified plane ) to @xmath24 ( spin space or the target space of the @xmath17model ) .",
    "such maps are characterized by an integer topological charge @xmath25 , which can be expressed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the topological ( pontryagin ) density introduced earlier .",
    "as noted there , the topological density plays a crucial role in the physics of qh ferromagnets as it is proportional to the charge density of the underlying itinerant system .",
    "consequently , localized configurations of topological charge @xmath25 , which we shall term charge @xmath25 skyrmions , carry electric charge @xmath28 .    in the absence of the zeeman and coulomb terms , the energy functional ( [ eeff ] ) is scale invariant and rotationally invariant but on account of the non - linearity implicit in the definition of @xmath29 , finding its skyrmion solutions is a non - trivial problem , solved previously by belavin and polyakov ( bp ) @xcite .",
    "the additional terms break both symmetries although they preserve rotations about the field axis which we shall take to be the @xmath30-axis . for the full action , the bp technique ( based on achieving a bogomolnyi bound @xcite for the action ) breaks down with the non - locality of the coulomb term making matters even worse .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to attack the euler - lagrange equation for the energy functional directly .",

    "gives an integro - differential equation .    in the ground state the spin of the ferromagnetic component is polarized : @xmath31 . for a skyrmion with topological charge @xmath25 , we make the ansatz ( in polar coordinates @xmath32 with their origin at the center of the skyrmion ) : @xmath33 this leads to the topological density @xmath34 for a finite energy configuration , the spin vector must be aligned with the external magnetic field at infinity . at the center the spin points in the opposite direction .",
    "this leads to the boundary conditions @xmath35 , and ( [ pontryagin ] ) shows that ( [ ansatz ] ) describes configurations with topological charge @xmath25 . note that the topological density is independent of @xmath36 ,",
    "i.e. _ it is spatially rotationally invariant ; since a shift @xmath37 in ( [ ansatz ] ) is a spin rotation it is clear that the topological density is invariant under spin rotations about the @xmath30-axis as well .",
    "note however , that the spin field itself is not separately invariant under rotations and spin rotations  it is invariant only under the combination generated by @xmath38 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that respecting both symmetries is incompatible with non - trivial skyrmion solutions .",

    "by contrast to the bp solutions , the skyrmions in the qh ferromagnet have a definite size set by a competition between the coulomb energy , @xmath64 , and the zeeman energy , @xmath20 . the coulomb energy favors large skyrmions since it decreases when charge is spread out .",
    "the zeeman energy , on the other hand , increases when more spins are flipped , _",

    ", it is clear that @xmath70 whence by a general balance argument the _ value _ of @xmath71 as well .",
    "consequently , as @xmath69 , the energy of the skyrmion will approach the bogomolnyi bound and we expect that the solution itself will converge to a bp solution with an appropriately chosen @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out that this observation is sufficient to determine the leading small @xmath72 characteristics of the skyrmions with @xmath73 , but needs to be supplemented by global considerations for @xmath39 .",
    "these follow from identifying the various length scales in the problem by pairwise balancing the terms , @xmath74 , in the energy functional .",
    "this yields three scales : @xmath75 ( @xmath76 and @xmath64 ) , @xmath77 ( @xmath20 and @xmath64 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath20 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "note that _ two _ of these scales diverge as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "hence a global solution to ( 12 ) in this limit can be expected to exhibit _ both _ of these scales .",
