    "the initial energy density in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at lhc energy exceeds by a few order of magnitudes the critical value required for quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "thus , according to matsui and satz [ 1,2 ] , one expects the formation of charmonium bound states to be severely suppressed due to debye screening .",
    "the initially produced @xmath5 pairs in hard parton scattering , however , due to charm conservation , will survive in the deconfined medium until the system reaches the critical temperature where the charm quarks hadronize , forming predominately @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons . an appreciable fraction of @xmath5 pairs and consequently @xmath6,@xmath7 mesons produced in pb - pb collisions at lhc energy can lead to an additional production of charmonium bound states due to reactions such as : @xmath8 and @xmath9 as first indicated in @xcite . in this work we present a quantitative description of the secondary @xmath0 and @xmath1 production due to the above processes from the thermal hadronic medium created in pb - pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "the charmonium production cross section @xmath10 can be related to the hadronic absorption of charmonium @xmath11 , through the detailed balance relation @xmath12    where @xmath13[s-(m_a - m_b)^2]/4s$ ] denotes the square of the center of mass momentum of the corresponding reaction and @xmath14 stands for @xmath15 or @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17 for @xmath0 or @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the degeneracy factor @xmath19 takes the values : @xmath20 , @xmath21 with the pions in the final state and @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 for the processes with @xmath15 mesons .",
    "the magnitude of charmonium absorption cross section on hadrons is still , however , theoretically not well under control .",
    "there are four models which have been proposed to give an estimate for the @xmath0 dissociation cross section on pions : ( 1 ) the constituent quark model @xcite , ( 2 ) the comover model @xcite , ( 3 ) an effective hadronic lagrangian @xcite and ( 4 ) a short distance qcd approach @xcite .    in the framework of the constituent quark model the @xmath0 absorption on a pion",
    "is viewed as a quark exchange process where the charm quark changes its side with a light quark . the cross section for the @xmath25 process , in this approach , was calculated in the non - relativistic quark model in terms of the first born approximation @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the above cross section for the final state @xmath26 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one sees that the cross section abruptly increases just above threshold and reaches its peak value of about 6 mb .",
    "the large value of the cross section is mostly due to the particular modelling of the confining interaction between the quarks which is taken as attractive , independent of the colour quantum number of the affected quark pair .",
    "the large charm quark mass , @xmath27 gev and @xmath0 binding energy , @xmath28640 gev in comparison to @xmath29 , as well as small size of @xmath0 , @xmath30@xmath31 , have been used as an argument to calculate the charmonium dissociation on light hadrons in terms of a qcd approach @xcite . the @xmath32 cross section in this approach",
    "is expressed in terms of hadronic gluon distribution functions , making use of the short distance qcd method based on sum rules derived from the operator product expansion .",
    "the resulting energy dependence of the @xmath0 absorption cross section on pions calculated within qcd @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the hadronic gluon distribution functions are strongly suppressed at high gluon momenta .",
    "thus , since the dissociation of @xmath0 requires hard gluons , the absorption cross section @xmath33 becomes very small just above threshold as seen in fig .",
    "1 . recent analysis of @xmath34 photoproduction data confirms the relation between the charmonium - hadron interactions and the hadronic gluon structure @xcite indicating a small value of the @xmath0 absorption cross section on hadrons .",
    "the scattering of @xmath0 on @xmath16 or @xmath15 meson can be also described as the exchange of open charm mesons between the charmonium and the incident particle . near the kinematical threshold",
    "this exchange was modeled in terms of an effective meson lagrangian @xcite . in fig .",
    "1 we show the energy dependence of the cross section for @xmath0 dissociation in this approach .",
    "the result for the cross section should be considered here as an upper limit since in the model the hadronic form - factor was taken to be unity .    in phenomenological models describing charmonium production in pa and light nucleus - nucleus collisions the dissociation cross section of charmonium on light mesons",
    "was assumed to be energy independent @xcite . using a value of @xmath35 mb , which was shown to be consistent with the pa data , and the quark structure of hadrons one could fix the @xmath36 mb .",
    "the differences between these various models for the energy dependence of the @xmath0-@xmath16 cross section are particularly large near threshold .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties of the cross section seen in fig . 1 will naturally influence the yield of the secondary charmonium production . in the following , we shall calculate and compare the yield of the secondary @xmath34 with all these cross sections .    the @xmath1 absorption cross section has not been evaluated in the quark exchange and effective lagrangian model .",
    "the application of the short distance qcd is not possible in this case due to the very low binding energy of the @xmath1 ( of the order of 60 mev ) and the correspondingly large size of the @xmath1 .",
    "for a first estimate of the @xmath1 dissociation on light mesons we assume that the absorption cross section is energy independent and attains its geometric value of about 10 mb very near the threshold .",
    "this assumption was shown to provide a quite good description of the @xmath1 suppression observed in s - u collisions @xcite .      in a thermal hadronic medium",
    "the rate of charmonium production from @xmath2 annihilation is determined by the thermally averaged cross section and the densities of incoming and outgoing particles .",
    "the thermal average of the charmonium production cross section @xmath37 is given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath38   [ t^2-(m_{d\\bar d}^-)^2 ]   k_1(\\beta t)}\\over   { m_d^2m_{\\bar d}^2k_2(\\beta m_d)k_2(\\beta m_{\\bar d } ) } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are modified bessel functions of the second kind , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the center - of - mass energy , @xmath44 the inverse temperature , @xmath45 is the relative velocity of incoming mesons and the integration limit is taken to be : @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "the thermal cross section for the production and absorption of charmonium convoluted with the densities of incoming particles describes the rate equation for charmonium production in a hadron gas per unit of rapidity by :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 , @xmath14 denotes a @xmath16 or @xmath15 meson and @xmath17 stands for @xmath1 or @xmath0 .    in the hadronic medium",
    "we include the following secondary charmonium production processes : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath17 stands for @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the solution of the rate equation requires additional assumptions on the space - time evolution of the hadronic medium and the initial number of @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "we have adopted a model for the expansion dynamics assuming isentropic cylindrical expansion of the thermal fireball . to account for transverse expansion we assume a linear increase of the radius of a cylinder with the proper time .",
    "thus , at a given proper time @xmath51 the volume of the system is parameterized by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the initial proper time when the system is created as a thermally equilibrated quark - gluon plasma and @xmath54 is an initial radius being determined by the atomic number of colliding nucleus . for central pb - pb collisions @xmath55 and we fixed @xmath56 fm .",
    "the initially produced quark - gluon plasma cools during the expansion until it reaches the critical temperature @xmath57 at the time @xmath58 where it starts to hadronize .",
    "the system stays in the mixed phase until the time @xmath59 , where the quark gluon plasma is totally converted to a hadron gas .",
    "the purely hadronic gas can still expand until it reaches the chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath60 at the time @xmath61 where all inelastic particle scattering ceases and the particle production stops .",
    "the most recent results of lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) give an upper limit for the critical temperature in qcd to be @xmath62gev @xcite .",
    "the analysis of presently available data for different particle multiplicities and their ratios measured in heavy ion collisions at sps energy suggests that the chemical freezeout temperature at lhc should be in the range @xmath63 @xcite , that is very close to @xmath57 .",
    "to make a quantitative description of the space - time evolution of a thermal medium one still needs to specify the equation of state .",
    "the quark gluon plasma is considered as an ideal gas of quarks and gluons whereas the hadron gas is described as an ideal gas of hadrons and resonances .",
    "we have included the contributions of all baryonic and mesonic resonances with a mass of up to 1.6 gev into the partition function . to take into account",
    "approximately the repulsive interactions between hadrons at short distances we apply excluded volume corrections .",
    "here we use the thermodynamically consistent model proposed in @xcite where the thermodynamical observables for extended particles are obtained from the formulas for pointlike objects but with the shift of the chemical potential .",
    "in particular the pressure is described by : @xmath64 where the particle eigenvolume @xmath65 simulates repulsive interactions between hadrons . following the detailed analysis in @xcite",
    "we have assigned the value @xmath66 fm for all mesons and baryons .    in fig.2",
    "we show the time evolution of the temperature for pb - pb collisions at lhc energy for two different values of @xmath57 .",
    "the initial temperature of the chemically equilibrated plasma was fixed requiring the entropy conservation : @xmath67 where @xmath68 described the final number of pions at midrapidity , @xmath69 is the initial volume and @xmath70 the initial entropy density of the thermalized quark - gluon plasma . for @xmath71 and @xmath53=0.1",
    "fm we get the initial thermalization temperature @xmath72gev for pb - pb collisions at lhc .",
    "the result in fig.2 shows that for @xmath62gev the qgp starts to hadronize after 14 fm and stays in the mixed phase by 20 fm .",
    "taking the lowest expected freezeout temperature @xmath73 gev the system exists only for a very short time of few fm in a hadronic phase .",
    "thus , the contribution of the purely hadronic phase to the overall secondary charmonium multiplicity can be neglected .",
    "the secondary charmonium bound states are produced almost entirely during the mixed phase .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite . in fig .",
    "3 we show the time evolution of the total volume @xmath74 as well as the fraction of the volume @xmath75 occupied by hadrons during the mixed phase .",
    "the total volume is calculated following eq.6 , whereas @xmath75 can be obtained from the condition of entropy conservation in the following form : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the entropy density in the quark gluon plasma and the hadron gas at the critical temperature . for the equation of state described above and @xmath79gev",
    "we have : @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the time evolution of the hadronic medium during the mixed phase is totally determined by the number of pions in the final state and the entropy density of the quark - gluon plasma and the hadron gas at the critical temperature .",
    "our default parameters for the expansion dynamics are as follows : @xmath82 we will study , however , how deviations from the above values influence the final multiplicity of the secondary charmonium produced during the evolution of hadronic medium .",
    "the initial number of open charm mesons at the critical temperature @xmath83 can be related to the number of primary @xmath84 quarks @xmath85 produced in a - a collisions . neglecting the possible absorption and production of @xmath5 pairs during the evolution and hadronization of a quark - gluon plasma we can put @xmath86 . due to charm conservation",
    "the number of @xmath87s should be equal to the number of @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the charm conservation also implies that during the mixed phase the number of @xmath2 mesons in the hadronic phase @xmath88is given by the fraction of volume occupied by the hadrons that is @xmath89 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are described by eq.6 and 9 .",
    "we further assume that during hadronization of the quark gluon plasma the open charm mesons are in a local thermal equilibrium with all other hadrons , however , the yield of @xmath6 and @xmath7 exceeds their chemical equilibrium value .",
    "the ratio of the number of @xmath6 to @xmath90 mesons at the temperature @xmath91 is obtained from the relative chemical equilibrium condition : @xmath92    the initial number of @xmath5 pairs in pb - pb collisions at lhc energy was obtained by scaling the p - p result with the geometrically allowed number of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the cross section for charm production at lhc in p - p collisions was calculated by leading order perturbative qcd using code pythia with @xmath93gev@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "typical values of the 50@xmath94 pairs and @xmath95@xmath0 were obtained in central pb - pb collisions at midrapidity .",
    "the @xmath5 pairs can be also produced and absorbed during the evolution of thermally equilibrated quark - gluon plasma . in lowest order in @xmath96 the charm quark pairs",
    "are produced by gluon and quark pair fusion . solving a similar rate equation as in eq.3 @xcite but with the appropriate qcd cross sections we calculated in fig.4 the time evolution of the number of thermal @xmath5 pairs .",
    "the thermal production is seen in fig.4 not to be negligible as compared with the preequilibrium production .",
    "dependent on the thermalization time there are an additional 5 - 10 @xmath5 pairs produced during the evolution of the thermally and chemically equilibrated plasma .",
    "this number , however , depends crucially on the value of the charm quark mass @xmath97 and the strong coupling constant @xmath96 .",
    "in fig.5 we compare the thermal @xmath5 multiplicity calculated with @xmath98 gev and @xmath99 gev with @xmath100 .",
    "dynamical models for parton production and evolution like hijing @xcite or sspc @xcite confirmed , that indeed , after a very short time of the order of 0.1 - 0.5fm the partonic medium can reach the thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , both quarks and gluons my appear far below their chemical saturation values .",
    "thus , discussing thermal @xmath5 production one should take into account deviations of gluon and light quark yields from their equilibrium values .",
    "these deviations can be parameterized by fugacities parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 modifying the boltzman distribution function of quarks and gluons @xcite .    in fig.6",
    "we calculated the time evolution of @xmath5 pairs within the kinetic model derived in @xcite for a non - equilibrium quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the following initial conditions for the thermalization time @xmath53 , the initial temperature @xmath103 and the values for quark @xmath101 and gluon @xmath102 fugacities were fixed for pb - pb collisions at lhc from sspc @xcite and hijing @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 @xmath107 @xcite ; ( 2 ) @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 @xmath111 @xcite ; ( 3 ) @xmath108 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 @xmath114 @xcite . in a non - equilibrium plasma ,",
    "dependent on the initial conditions , there are 3 - 5 @xmath5 pairs produced during the evolution of plasma as seen in fig.6 .",
    "one should also note that at the time when temperature reaches the critical value of @xmath115gev the quark and gluon fugacities are very close to unity which indicates the chemical equilibration of an ideal quark - gluon plasma .",
    "from the results presented in fig@xmath116s.4 - 6 one concludes , that dependent on the initial conditions as well as on the amount of chemical equilibration of the plasma , one expects 5 - 10 @xmath2 pairs at @xmath57 in addition to the 50 @xmath2 from the hadronization of the initially produced @xmath5 pairs .",
    "the number of produced charmonium bound states from @xmath2 scattering is obtained by multiplying the rate equation eq.3 by the volume of the hadron gas eq.9 and then performing the time integration . in fig.7",
    "we show the time evolution of the abundance of @xmath0 from pb - pb collisions at lhc energy obtained by solving the rate equation .",
    "the calculations were done with the four different models for @xmath117 absorption cross section described in fig.1 and assuming initially 50 @xmath2 and 12000 pions at midrapidity .",
    "the results in fig.7 show a very strong sensitivity of @xmath0 production on the absorption cross section .",
    "the largest number of the secondary @xmath34 is obtained with the cross section predicted by the quark exchange model . here",
    "the number of @xmath34 is only by 1/2 smaller than the primary value .",
    "if , however , the absorption cross section is described by short distance qcd the secondary @xmath0 production is lower by more than two orders of magnitude .    recent analysis of @xmath0 photoproduction data confirms the relation between the energy dependences of the @xmath34 cross section and the feynmann x - dependence of the gluon distribution function of the nucleon @xcite . this could be used as an indication that the short distance qcd approach is a consistent way to calculate the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "thus , the secondary production of @xmath0 from the hadronic gas can be entirely neglected in this case .",
    "the situation can , however , change when discussing the production of @xmath1    the time evolution of the abundance of @xmath1 is presented in fig.8 with the same basic parameters as used for @xmath0 in fig.7 .",
    "we show in fig.8 the separate contributions of the production processes for the secondary @xmath1 with @xmath16 and @xmath15 mesons in the final state . following the arguments of the previous section the absorption cross section for @xmath1 on @xmath16 and @xmath15",
    "mesons were taken to be energy independent and equal to its geometric value of 10 mb .",
    "the produced @xmath1 during the mixed phase from @xmath2 annihilation is seen in fig.8 to saturate at the large value 0.08 , which is almost 1/5 of the primary number of @xmath0 expected for pb - pb collisions at lhc energy .",
    "the yield of the secondary charmonium summarized in fig@xmath116s.7 - 8 depends on the parameters used in calculations . in the following",
    "we study the modification of the results on the secondary @xmath1 by changing the initial number of @xmath2 mesons as well as the values of the relevant thermal parameters .    in fig.9",
    "we discuss the yield of @xmath1 for different multiplicities of @xmath2 mesons by including the contribution of thermal @xmath5 pairs . from the rate equation eq.3",
    "it is clear that this dependence is quadratic .",
    "the increase of @xmath2 by 10 - 20@xmath118 implies the @xmath119 increase of the @xmath1 yield .    in the space - time evolution model",
    "all parameters were fixed assuming @xmath120 .",
    "this number , however , is still not well established and the deviations for @xmath121 in the range @xmath122 are not excluded . in fig.10",
    "we show the sensitivity of the results for @xmath1 production on @xmath68 . keeping the same number of @xmath2 mesons and decreasing @xmath121 the number of the secondary @xmath1 increases as seen in fig.10 .",
    "this is mostly because by decreasing @xmath121 the initial density @xmath123 of @xmath2 increases leading to a larger production of the charmonium bound states .    modelling the equation of state we have fixed the critical entropy density @xmath124 in the quark gluon plasma by the ideal gas equation of state . from the lattice gauge theory we know , however that , due to interactions , the entropy density @xmath77 could be smaller by a significant factor .",
    "deviation of the momentum distribution of quarks and gluons from the chemical saturation is also reducing the critical entropy density of quark - gluon plasma . to establish the influence of a decreasing critical entropy density we calculated the total number of @xmath1 as a function of the ratio @xmath125 in fig.11 . decreasing the entropy density of a quark - gluon plasma by a factor of two",
    "reduces the yield of @xmath0 by 70@xmath118 .",
    "this is mostly because the time the system spends in the mixed phase is shorter .",
    "however , even with this reduction of the entropy density the secondary production of @xmath1 is not negligible .",
    "the influence of the result on the critical entropy density in a hadron gas @xmath78 is less important .",
    "increasing @xmath78 , by a factor of two reduces the total number of @xmath1 by only 10@xmath118 .",
    "the secondary @xmath1 production in a mixed phase is also sensitive to the parameterization of the time evolution of the system size in transverse direction . increasing the transverse expansion parameter from 0.15 to @xmath126 in eq.6 decreases the total number of @xmath1 produced during the mixed phase by 40 @xmath118 .",
    "taking a quadratic dependence of @xmath127 on proper time as proposed in @xcite decreases the yield of @xmath1 from 0.08 to 0.036 , which is still comparable with the number of primary @xmath1 .",
    "we have considered the possibility of the secondary charmonium production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at lhc energy .",
    "admitting thermalization of a partonic medium crated in a collision and the subsequent first order phase transition to a hadronic matter we have shown that the secondary charmonium production appears almost entirely during the mixed phase .",
    "the yield of secondarily produced @xmath17 mesons is very sensitive to the hadronic absorption cross section . within the context of the short distance",
    "qcd approach this leads to negligible values for j/@xmath17 regeneration .",
    "the @xmath1 production , however , can be large and may even exceed the initial yield from primary hard scattering . thus it is conceivable that at lhc energy the @xmath1 charmonium state can be seen in the final state whereas @xmath0 production can be entirely suppressed .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath1 in the final state could be thus considered as an indication for the charmonium production from the secondary hadronic rescattering .",
