    "water masers are found in the vicinity of @xmath10 of infrared bright ( 100 @xmath9 m @xmath11 1000 jy and 60 @xmath9 m @xmath11 100 jy ) ultracompact hii ( uchii ) regions in our galaxy @xcite , providing excellent signposts for active star formation .",
    "the term `` kilomaser '' was coined to describe extragalactic h@xmath12o masers with luminosities comparable to the brightest star formation h@xmath12o masers in our galaxy ( e.g. w49n ; @xmath13 l@xmath14 ) .",
    "kilomaser isotropic luminosities ( @xmath15 l@xmath14 ) are much lower than the more widely studied `` megamasers '' found in the nuclear regions of agn ( i.e. ngc  4258 ) , with luminosities up to 10@xmath16 l@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "since `` kilomasers '' can in principle be either of nuclear ( i.e. amplifying a background agn ) or star formation origin , we will use the term `` galactic - analog '' ( ga ) maser to refer to non - nuclear masers with kilomaser luminosity .",
    "natal super star clusters are thought to contain 1000s of uchii regions , therefore ga- masers may help pinpoint sites of young extragalactic cluster formation , though there have been few searches with the required sensitivity . until recently ga- masers had been unambiguously detected toward only six nearby galaxies : lmc , m82 , ic  342 , ic  10 , m33 , and ngc  2146 with isotropic luminosities in the range 0.005 to 4 @xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the remaining few known kilomasers are either associated with agn activity or their origin is ambiguous .",
    "we recently conducted a greenbank telescope ( gbt ) search for masers toward four nearby starburst galaxies ( @xmath17 mpc ) , known to harbor natal super star clusters and without known agn ( or at worst low luminosity agn ) down to a sensitivity level sufficient to detect strong ga- masers .",
    "positive detections were found for all four galaxies ( the antennae galaxies , he2 - 10 , ngc  4214 , and ngc  5253 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that ga- maser emission may be common in starburst galaxies .",
    "the unusual success of this mini - survey arises from its order of magnitude greater sensitivity compared to most previous single dish surveys for either kilomasers or megamasers .",
    "the strongest masers were detected toward the antennae ( d@xmath18 mpc mpc @xcite to @xmath19 mpc @xcite ; we adopt 22 mpc . ] ) interacting galaxies ( ngc  4038/ngc  4039 ; arp244 ) .",
    "indeed , this violent merger is an ideal laboratory to study how maser emission behaves in regions of extreme star formation . in this paper",
    "we report sensitive high angular resolution very large array ( vla ) water maser observations of the antennae galaxies , along with archival 3.6 and 6  cm continuum , co , and optical / near - ir data in order to pinpoint the maser locations and determine the nature of the emission .",
    "we observed the ( @xmath20 ) ortho - water maser line at 22.23508  ghz toward the antennae galaxies in the vla a - configuration using fast - switching and reference pointing .",
    "the full width at half power ( fwhp ) at the doppler shifted frequency of @xmath21 ghz is @xmath22 , encompassing both nuclei ( ngc  4038 and ngc  4039 ) , as well as the interaction region ( iar ; see figure  [ spectra]a ) ; in comparison the gbt primary beam was only @xmath23 . in order to cover the velocity extent of maser emission detected with the gbt with similar velocity resolution ( 3.7 km  s@xmath24 ) required three correlator settings , each with 2 ifs .",
    "we also retrieved a and b - configuration 3.6  cm continuum data , as well as bna - configuration 6  cm data from the vla archive ( the b - configuration data were included in the multi - configuration study of * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "data calibration followed standard high - frequency procedures in aips , including using a model for the brightness distribution of the absolute flux calibrator 3c  286 ; absolute flux calibration is good to @xmath25 .",
    "the line - free channels from the @xmath21 ghz data were used to estimate the 1.3  cm continuum emission in the uv - plane .",
