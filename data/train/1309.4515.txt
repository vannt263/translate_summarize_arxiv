    "the away - side correlation is found to be single peaked at @xmath3 for in - plane triggers , but become double - peaked for out - of - plane triggers .",
    "the results indicate that the ridge is dominated by in - plane triggers and the away - side double - peak is dominated by out - of - plane triggers .",
    "the major backgrounds to jet - like correlations are two - particle correlations caused by single - particle anisotropic flows . the elliptic and quadrangular flow backgrounds have been subtracted in dihadron correlations as a function of @xmath4 in  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently suggested , however , that there should be triangular anisotropic flow  @xcite .",
    "the triangular anisotropy is a result of hydrodynamics evolution from initial - state geometry triangularity due to event - by - event fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it is demonstrated illustratively by the nexspherio model  @xcite that initial energy density fluctuations ( hot spots ) with subsequent hydro evolution may generate a near - side ridge and a double - peak correlation on the away side .",
    "triangular anisotropic flow would result in three peaks at @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 in two - particle correlations .",
    "these peaks would qualitatively explain the observed ridge and double - peak structure in dihadron correlations .",
    "the natural question is then , whether hydrodynamic triangular flow can explain entirely the observed ridge and double - peak correlations ?",
    "this talk attempts to answer this question .",
    "the current understanding of anisotropic flow backgrounds , up to the fourth - order harmonic , is given by : @xmath8.\\label{eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the trigger and associated particle @xmath11 harmonic flow anisotropy , respectively ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the trigger particle second and fourth harmonic anisotropies with respect to the second harmonic plane , @xmath14 and averaged with a given @xmath4 range ( see  @xcite for details ) ; and @xmath15 is the component of the fourth harmonic anisotropy uncorrelated to @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) , and verified by experiments  @xcite , that @xmath16 fluctuation effects are uncorrelated to @xmath14 .    in the following sections we discuss the flow backgrounds of eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) in detail .",
    "we focus on the dihadron correlations at large @xmath17 in the interest to study the near - side ridge correlations as well as the away - side correlations .",
    "for the dihadron correlation data presented in  @xcite , the maximum systematic uncertainty bound of @xmath18 is obtained by @xmath19 averaged over the away - side of two - particle correlations between the particle of interest and a reference particle in the flow measurements in order to avoid near - side small angle nonflow contributions .",
    "the results  @xcite are shown in the first row of fig .",
    ". this would be the correct maximum systematic bound of @xmath18 if only even harmonic flows are present .",
    "with non - vanishing odd harmonic flows , this estimate of the maximum systematic bound would not necessarily be the maximum @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we now use the @xmath19 averaged over the entire @xmath20 range as the upper bound of the @xmath18 systematic uncertainty .",
    "this is larger than the previous estimate because of the inclusion of large nonflow contributions from near - side correlations .",
    "the two - particle correlations to obtain the maximum @xmath18 are restricted to @xmath17 because the dihadron correlations we study are from the same @xmath17 region .",
    "the new estimated systematic upper bound is the maximum possible @xmath18 that should be subtracted from raw dihadron correlations .",
    "the low systematic bound of @xmath18 is still the four - particle cumulant measurement as in  @xcite .",
    "the default @xmath18 is the average of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the qualitative features of the correlation functions are unchanged .",
    "the away - side double - peak structure out - of - plane remains prominent .",
    "the decreasing trend of the ridge magnitude from in - plane to out - of - plane is unaffected because a constant @xmath16 contribution over @xmath4 is subtracted .",
    "this indicates that the main features of the measured near - side ridge and away - side double - peak in the dihadron correlations with high @xmath0 trigger particles , whether or not integrated over @xmath4 , are not entirely due to the triangular flow contributions , but other physics mechanisms .",
    "we have so far subtracted the @xmath35 background correlated with the second harmonic plane , @xmath14 .",
    "we have used the parameterization to the previous @xmath35 measurement  @xcite , @xmath36    there is an additional contribution to @xmath34 that is uncorrelated to @xmath14 and arises from fluctuations .",
    "the uncorrelated component can be obtained by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the @xmath34 measured by the two - particle cumulant method with @xmath29 . because @xmath15 is small",
    ", its effect on dihadron correlation is negligible .",
    "the dihadron correlation results with @xmath15 subtraction is effectively as same as those shown in the third row of fig .",
    "one can always attribute all azimuthal dependence to fourier harmonics .",
    "in fact , luzum  @xcite argued that our @xmath17 correlation data can be fitted by fourier harmonics up to the @xmath39 order and the fitted coefficients are consistent with features expected from anisotropic flows .",
    "this is not surprising because nonflow effects , which must be contained in the fitted fourier coefficients , are relatively small compared to the flow contributions in our kinematic regions .",
    "if the observed @xmath4-dependent ridge is due to anisotropic flow , then the harmonic flows must be @xmath4-dependent .",
    "this may not be impossible , however , as the requirement of trigger particles in a particular @xmath4 bin from the event plane reconstructed from particles in @xmath31  gev/@xmath25  could preferentially select events with associated particle @xmath18 displaced from the average . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the two - particle cumulant @xmath40 in events of different @xmath4 values separately , and subtract them from the dihadron correlations .",
    "since reference particles are used to reconstruct the event plane to determine the @xmath4 , one can not calculate @xmath40 from cumulant of the associated particle and a reference particle in event sample selected according to @xmath4 .",
    "instead , we form two - particle cumulant from particles in a given associated @xmath41 bin , applying @xmath2-gap of 0.7 .",

    "the @xmath51 is independent of @xmath4 , consistent with the expectation that the third and second harmonic planes are uncorrelated .",

    "sec : v4uc ] .",
    "we therefore use the @xmath4-independent @xmath38 measured by two - particle cumulant with a reference particle , as in sec .",
    "[ sec : v4uc ] .",
    "we have checked our results using the @xmath4-dependent @xmath47 and found no observable difference .",
    "we subtract flow background using the @xmath4-dependent @xmath53 . the trigger particle @xmath18 is still given by the two - particle cumulant flow obtained with a reference particle .",
    "this is because the trigger @xmath18 is the second harmonic modulation of trigger particles which determines the @xmath4 .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig ] shows the dihadron correlation results with subtraction of @xmath4-dependent @xmath30 .",
    "the change from the lower systematic bound in the third row is the subtraction of the @xmath4-dependent @xmath18 in place of the @xmath4-independent one .",
    "as seen from figure , the near - side ridge is diminished , maybe as expected , because the large @xmath23 ridge is presumably included in the subtracted @xmath40 .",
    "however , it is important to point out that it is not automatically guaranteed that the ridge will be gone just because the @xmath40 s are measured by two - particle cumulant either with a reference particle or with a particle from the same @xmath0 region .",
    "this is because they are not simply measured by the trigger - associated particle pair at @xmath17 .",
    "if they were , then the correlation will be strictly zero everywhere , both on the near side and on the away side .",
    "it is interesting to note , despite of the diminished near - side ridge , that the away - side correlation is not diminished .",
    "it still evolves from a single peak with in - plane trigger particles to a double peak with out - of - plane trigger particles .",
    "the observation of the away - side double - peak structure for out - of - plane triggers seems robust against the wide range of flow background subtraction .",
    "since the ridge is diminished after subtraction of @xmath4-dependent @xmath18 from two - particle cumulant at large @xmath23 , can we conclude that the physics origin of the ridge is hydrodynamic @xmath40 flow ?",
    "the answer is no because any non - hydrodynamic origin of @xmath40 is also included in the two - particle @xmath40 measurements . in other words , any ridge signal ( whatever its physics origin might be ) is included in @xmath40 , and the ridge would be subtracted after subtraction of @xmath40 .",
    "however , one also can not rule out the ridge being part of hydrodynamic flow .",
    "this is because it is still possible that hydrodynamic flow of the underlying event is biased by the selection of the trigger particle orientation , and all the long - range @xmath23 correlation may be indeed due to flow .",
    "if @xmath18 depends on @xmath4 , then there is an important implication to the inclusive dihadron correlation ( i.e. , without cutting on @xmath4 ) . for inclusive dihadron correlation ,",
    "a flow background @xmath54 has been used in place of @xmath55 .",
    "( note , for clarity , we have omitted the @xmath56 notation throughout the article except here . )",
    "this is correct because fluctuations are already included in the two - particle cumulant flow measurement of @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath18 depends on trigger particle orientation @xmath4 , then the equality @xmath58 is no longer valid",
    ". the left side will be always larger than the right side .",
    "this means that the inclusive dihadron flow background is underestimated by @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , because @xmath59 is positive for @xmath60 and negative for @xmath61 , the true background magnitude for inclusive dihadron correlation is even larger than that for the @xmath62 dihadron correlation , which has the largest background magnitude of all @xmath4 bins .",
    "namely @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fig : inclusive_dihadron ] illustrates the effect .",
    "the left panel shows the raw dihadron correlation for @xmath24  gev/@xmath25  and @xmath64  gev/@xmath25  together with two flow background curves both zyam - normalized . the blue histogram is from a traditional inclusive dihadron correlation analysis with the @xmath18 modulation calculated from @xmath54 .",
