    "quantum frequency translation ( qft ) is the process whereby two spectral modes ( or narrow bands of modes ) are swapped in the sense that the properties of their quantum states ( other than their central frequencies ) are interchanged , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mikefig ] @xcite .",
    "such a process , of course , requires an external source or sink of energy , which is provided by a strong external optical field .",
    "ideally , an arbitrary state of the narrow band of green modes will be swapped with the state of the narrow band of blue modes .",
    "these could be coherent , squeezed , or number states , and may also be entangled with other , separate degrees of freedom , such as other modes ( e.g. , violet and yellow ) or states of atoms , quantum dots , etc . when the states of the green and blue modes are swapped , the prior entanglement should be preserved .",
    "this paper focuses on the qft of single - photon states .",
    "qft is defined to be  noiseless , \" that is , free of excess background noise .",
    "for example , if both modes to be swapped are initially vacuum , they should remain vacuum@xmath0there are no spontaneous processes that can populate modes in this case .",
    "the noiseless property distinguishes qft from other frequency conversion processes such as optical parametric amplification , which has been widely studied for use in classical telecom systems @xcite . in optical parametric amplification ,",
    "power is spontaneously transferred from the pump(s ) to the weak signal fields , and without any blue input power , the signal fields can build up spontaneously .",
    "the qft capability will play important roles in quantum information science ( qis ) , where states of a quantum memory may be transmitted to a spatially remote quantum memory by emitting and absorbing photons .",
    "if the two memories operate using distinct frequencies of their absorption / emission lines , it is necessary to  translate \" the communication photons between these frequencies .",
    "such a translation capability also allows sending the photons through low - loss optical fiber at wavelengths near 1500 nm , even in cases where the memories operate at other wavelengths .",
    "two methods for all - optical qft have been demonstrated : three - wave mixing in a second - order nonlinear optical medium ( crystal ) @xcite and more recently four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in a third - order nonlinear optical medium ( silica fiber ) @xcite . in the case of three - wave mixing and referring to fig . [",
    "fig : mikefig ] , the strong pump field must have frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the configuration for fwm with two pumps , denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is that of dynamic bragg scattering , in which for example , one photon is removed from pump @xmath2 and one is added to pump @xmath3 .",
    "at the same time , one photon is removed from the green signal and one is added to the blue signal so that @xmath4 .",
    "this contrasts with optical parametric amplification , wherein photons are removed from the pump(s ) and photons are added to both signals .",
    "experiments have included qft of one - half of a number - correlated state @xcite and several examples of qft of single - photon states by three - wave mixing in crystals @xcite and by fwm in fiber @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the fwm method over the three - wave mixing method is that it allows qft between spectral bands separated by large or small shifts , whereas in practice three - wave mixing allows qft only between far - separated bands @xcite .",
    "this paper treats the theory of fwm , but the same methods can easily be applied to three - wave mixing .",
    "a potentially revolutionary application of qft is that it is predicted to enable the interference of two photons ( or other states of the modes ) with different colors @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon generalizes the famous hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference effect , wherein two photons of like color and identical wave - packet structure impinge simultaneously on a standard beam splitter .",
    "because of the boson nature of photons , the beam - splitter output modes both contain either zero or two photons , but never one photon in each .",
    "this remarkable effect ( which is analogous to the exchange interaction for electrons ) enables a class of quantum information processing known as linear - optical quantum computing @xcite , including many variants @xcite .",
    "the promise of qft is that it offers the possibility to perform linear - optical quantum computing  over the rainbow . \"",
    "that is , one could use the light s color as a degree of freedom identifying optical qubits and perform linear - optical quantum computing using the generalization of the hom effect involving distinct frequencies .",
    "this would entail creating entangled states involving many distinct frequencies ( perhaps by methods such as in @xcite ) , and manipulating such states using two - mode interference via qft .",
    "this would require qft between modes nearby in frequency , and so fwm would be greatly preferred over three - wave mixing .",
    "other tools proposed for linear - optical quantum computing  over the rainbow \" are temporal - mode filters (  pulse gates \" @xcite which could be used as channel add / drop filters in an optical communications system @xcite ) and single - photon pulse shapers @xcite , based on qft by three - wave mixing .    in this paper",
    "we extend our earlier treatments @xcite to enable the explicit modeling of qft by fwm in optical fiber or by three - wave mixing in a crystal .",
    "the treatment includes analytical and numerical components , and allows us to model realistically the effects of finite pulse durations , linear dispersion , finite phase - matching bandwidth , and complicating effects such as self - phase modulation ( spm ) and cross - phase modulation ( cpm ) @xcite .",
    "previous theories of qft have either assumed single - mode fields @xcite , disallowing rigorous treatment of pulse propagation , or assumed that the signal pulse shapes are not altered significantly by the translation process @xcite , obscuring the accurate design of high - fidelity devices .",
    "the main results of this study are the following : we find that for realistic fiber and laser pulse parameters , essentially 100 percent efficient qft can , in principle , be achieved .",
    "we show that for given temporal shapes of the pump pulses , usually there are unique shapes that the two signal wave packets should have in order that they be swapped optimally by qft .",
    "these shapes are found as the optimal modes of a singular - value ( schmidt ) decomposition of the green function for the qft process , and the shapes change significantly with changing translation efficiency .",
    "this result provides a method for designing qft and two - photon interference with high efficiency and high fidelity .",
    "we also show , for a given pump temporal shape , how to design signal pulse shapes to create perfect hom interference via the fwm process , as first predicted in @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanism used to carry out frequency translation in fiber is the bragg scattering ( bs ) four - wave mixing process @xcite , pictured in fig . [",
    "fig : bstoon ] . for convenience , we refer to the two weak signal fields as  green \" and  blue , \" although in principle their actual frequencies could correspond to visible or near - ir radiation .",
    "two strong pump fields drive the process in which one photon from one of the pumps , pump @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bstoon ] , and one photon in the green field are annihilated while one photon from the other pump ( denoted @xmath3 ) and one photon in the blue field are created .",
    "the process conserves photon number in accordance with the manley - rowe relations @xcite and can be summarized as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents a photon .",
    "and @xmath7 and the signals have frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "the arrows symbolize either annihilation ( down ) or creation ( up ) of a photon in that mode .",
    "the frequency @xmath11 is the average value of all the frequencies and @xmath12 is the frequency separation between the pump fields and also between the signal fields.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    before describing the realistic continuous - frequency case , we discuss a much simpler model in which each field is represented by a single - frequency mode .",
    "such a model might apply to fields in a cavity , but strictly speaking not to the pulse propagation scenario in which we are interested .",
    "the simple model has the advantage of permitting analytical solutions , thereby providing some insight into the qft process @xcite . for cases where",
    "each field can be described by a single - frequency mode , the hamiltonian governing the process is given by @xmath13 where the creation / annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation relations , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are parameters quantifying the effects of phase - mismatch and nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "the evolution is given by the spatial equations - of - motion ( with a minus sign compared to the usual time - domain heisenberg equation ) @xmath16.\\ ] ]    the solution of for @xmath17 as a function of position along the fiber @xmath18 for a fiber of length @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 where the  transfer \" functions are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the transfer functions have the relation @xmath23 , which ensures the process is unitary and conserves photon number .",
    "mathematically , the bs translation process having frequency input and output  ports \" is identical to the normal beam - splitter operation on degenerate monochromatic fields @xcite . for perfect translation from green to blue , and vice versa , it must be that @xmath24 for a medium of length @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the quantum states of the modes are completely swapped .",
    "for example , a single green photon is replaced by a single blue photon , that is , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the state in which @xmath27 photons are in the green region and @xmath28 photons are in the blue region .",
    "since the bs process is analogous to beamsplitter action , all of the effects that a beamsplitter can induce on a field will also occur in the bs process .",
    "in particular , the effect analogous to two - photon hom interference will occur , where two independent photons of _ differing frequencies _ will interfere with one another and give a perfect hom dip under the appropriate circumstances @xcite .",
    "just as in the monochromatic hom interference effect , the  frequency beamsplitter \" must have equal transmission and reflection coefficients , that is @xmath29 , so that it is equally likely for the blue ( green ) photon to stay in the blue ( green ) mode or be translated to the green ( blue ) mode . using the above equations it can be shown that in this case , for an input state consisting of one green photon and one blue photon , denoted by @xmath30 , the output state is given by @xmath31 for equal values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 the @xmath34 component of the state cancels to zero .",
    "the above analysis is valid only if all the fields involved are single - mode . for fields that contain multiple - frequency components ,",
    "as any pulsed field does , the theory becomes much more complex .",
    "for arbitrary input , and even  simple \" multi - mode input such as gaussian pulses , the output can not in general be determined analytically .",
    "however , it is possible to assign analytically a green function @xmath35 in either frequency @xmath36 or time @xmath37 that relates the input wavepacket to the output wavepacket for arbitrary input , analogous to and , for given pump spectra , fiber dispersion , and fiber length @xcite . denoting the creation operator at position @xmath18 by @xmath38 , the input @xmath39 , and output @xmath40 are related by the _ forward _ transformation @xmath41 for our purposes ,",
    "the _ backward _ transformation is more useful : @xmath42 which gives the input operator in terms of an integral over the output operator .",
    "a single - photon input wavepacket given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the spectrum of the input wavepacket , is translated in the manner given by .",
    "the state can thus be expressed in terms of the output operator as @xmath45    the green function is unitary and therefore satisfies the condition @xmath46    to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the transfer function , we break up frequency space into two pieces ; the range that contains the green and the range that contains the blue .",
    "each operator or variable will be denoted by a  @xmath47 \" or  @xmath48 \" subscript .",
    "for example , the creation operator for an green photon at a particular green frequency will be written as @xmath49 . in this case",
    "the transfer function can be written in block form as @xcite @xmath50\\ ] ] where @xmath51 refers to the evolution of an output creation operator in range @xmath52 which came from range @xmath53 .",
    "although the @xmath35 function completely describes the evolution of arbitrary inputs , it is difficult to discover which input pulses give rise to desirable effects such as high - efficiency translation or good two - color hom interference just by examining the @xmath35 function .",
    "however , by performing a schmidt ( singular - value ) decomposition ( svd ) @xcite on the @xmath35 function or on the sub - matrices @xmath51 , the input wavefunctions necessary to achieve these effects can be found @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the translation of an input green field to the blue field , which is described by the green sub - matrix by @xmath54 , which is not hermitian and therefore does not admit a unitary decomposition .",
    "we write @xmath54 in its svd form as @xmath55 where the @xmath56 are the real , positive singular values ( the generalization of eigenvalues ) , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath59th column vectors of the unitary  matrices \" @xmath60 and @xmath61 describing the decomposition , respectively . the most useful way to interpret this decomposition is that a given green wavepacket @xmath57 will be translated to the blue wavepacket @xmath58 with probability @xmath62 . hence",
    ", only input green wavepackets @xmath57 that have associated singular values @xmath63 will translate over to the blue mode with 100 percent probability .",
    "the @xmath64  matrix \" describes an input green wavepacket scattering within the green spectral region at the output ( no translation from green to blue , although the shape of the wavepacket may change ) .",
    "if the svd of @xmath64 is given by @xcite @xmath65 then @xmath66 is the probability that an input green wavepacket @xmath57 will scatter to an output green wavepacket @xmath67 ( the @xmath60 matrix here being the same as in the @xmath54 decomposition ) .",
    "the singular values satisfy the relation @xmath68 , as they must to conserve photon number .",
    "similarly , the @xmath69 and @xmath70 have their own svds , given by @xmath71 where the @xmath61 and @xmath72 matrices , and the singular values @xmath73 and @xmath74 , are the same as in and .",
    "this highlights the interconnectedness between the various sub - green functions in that there are only four unique schmidt modes for each index @xmath59 that completely describe the process . before treating exclusively single - photon inputs ,",
    "we emphasize that the green functions determined by our present approach can be used to treat arbitrary multi - photon inputs as well .",
    "the svd technique can be used to discover what input wavepackets are suitable for optimal two - photon hom interference @xcite .",
    "the condition is somewhat intuitive . since in the single - mode ,",
    "two - color case it is necessary for both green and blue inputs to have a 50 percent probability of translating to the other mode for perfect hom interference , it is reasonable to guess this condition is also true in the multi - mode two - color case . hence for the cases in which @xmath75 , the corresponding input vectors @xmath57 and @xmath76 will show perfect two - color hom interference . alternatively",
    ", this condition can be written as @xmath77 we refer to the quantity @xmath78 as the hom singular value , because it appears as such for a schmidt decomposition kernel designed specifically to optimize the hom interference .",
    "( 37 ) of @xcite . )",
    "the closer it is to unity , the better the hom interference .",
    "there is an alternative , complimentary , method to calculate the degree of hom interference that a bs process will exhibit , for which the green function does not have to be calculated .",
    "first , consider the case in which there are two photons , either of which could be in the green or blue region , or in some superposition of both regions .",
    "in general , the state of this bi - photon can be written as @xmath79 must be normalized and the component states are orthonormal .",
    "now , for input consisting of one green photon and one blue photon having input spectra of @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively , the state is @xmath82 if the photons undergo the bs process , the input photon operators evolve according to . by switching the limits of integration and noting that @xmath83 \\rightarrow   a_{xy}(l,\\omega_{y})$ ] , where both @xmath84 and @xmath85 could be either @xmath47 or @xmath48 and @xmath86 is a component of the spectrum at the output of the fiber , the state can be written compactly as @xmath87 \\\\      & \\times \\big [ \\int d\\omega_{g}^ { ' } a_{g}^{\\dagger}(l,\\omega_{g}^ { ' } ) a_{gb}(l,\\omega_{g}^ { ' } ) + \\int d\\omega_{b}^ { ' } a_{b}^{\\dagger}(l,\\omega_{b}^ { ' } ) a_{bb}(l,\\omega_{b}^ { ' } ) \\big]|vac \\rangle . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the probability , given a particular output state , for the various sub - space states to occur is given by the modulus squared of the coefficients of these states , @xmath88 . for the @xmath34 state",
    "the coefficient is found by acting the aforementioned operators , with their accompanying functions , on the vacuum , yielding @xmath89 |1_{\\omega_{g } } , 1_{\\omega_{b}}\\rangle\\ ] ] the first term , @xmath90 , corresponds to the case where a photon initially in the green mode ( i.e. wavepacket ) scatters within the green mode at the output , and a photon initially in the blue mode scatters within the blue mode at the output .",
    "the second term , @xmath91 , corresponds to the case where a photon initially in the green mode scatters to the blue mode at the output , and a photon initially in the blue mode scatters to the green mode at the output . since these terms are being added before their modulus squared",
    "is taken , there is the chance that they could cancel if the terms are proportional and out of phase with one another .",
    "this is exactly what happens in the case in which ideal hom interference occurs , leaving zero probability amplitude for the field to emerge in the @xmath34 state .",
    "the expression for the probability for this state to occur @xmath92 is @xmath93 \\big ] .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    this gives an expression to calculate the coincidence probability for any given input pulses without knowing the green function for the process . in the alternative case in which we launch particular schmidt modes as input signals",
    ", we showed previously that the coincidence count rate equals @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this case we have a simple relation between @xmath92 and the hom singular values ; @xmath95 .",
    "other important quantities are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the probabilities that two photons appear in one or the other output ports together .",
    "the expressions for these , and their derivation can be found in appendix a.",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to discover the green function and its schmidt modes by examining the hamiltonian directly .",
    "one must solve for the full propagation first , then examine the input - output relations .",
    "this emphasizes that the schmidt modes are global properties , depending on the entire evolution .",
    "for example , the input schmidt modes depend on the length of the medium .",
    "the appropriate hamiltonian generates the well - known nonlinear schrodinger equation , which needs to be solved . in most realistic circumstances , taking into account actual field shapes and real fiber dispersion properties , it is not possible to solve the nonlinear schr@xmath98dinger equation for the fields analytically .",
    "so we turn to numerical computation to determine the evolution of a completely specified input state to a completely determined output state .",
    "the key difficulty with such an approach is that , in general , nonlinear operator equations can not be simulated by any simple numerical scheme . when the evolution is both in space and time as in our case , the problem becomes one suited for techniques such as the positive - p representation @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in our case , although the evolution is nonlinear in the pump fields , it is linear in the weak signal fields .",
    "this allows a simplification if we treat the pump fields as classically evolving parameters in the quantum heisenberg equations of motion for the weak signals .",
    "then the field operators for the weak signals can be solved in terms of green functions that obey the classical evolution equations .",
    "therefore , we solve numerically for the classical evolution of the green functions and use those solutions to calculate any quantum probability or correlation function concerning the signal fields .",
    "an analogous procedure was used in @xcite .    the usual starting point for solving for the nonlinear evolution of a pulse",
    "is to write the total field as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a slowly varying envelope function , @xmath101 is the high frequency of the carrier wave , and @xmath102 is the propagation constant at @xmath101 . in that form",
    "the evolution is governed by the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xmath103 although this is effective for single pulses , for electric fields made up of multiple , distinct pulses with significantly different frequency components , solving this form of the equation is unnecessarily computationally intensive and impractical .",
    "instead , we solve four coupled equations , derived from the nonlinear schrdinger equation , in which terms relating to dispersion , self - phase modulation , cross - phase , and the bs process were kept . numerically , the frequency components of each field are associated with a frequency mesh pertaining only to that field .",
    "this drastically reduces the number of calculations needed to compute the solution in that it is unnecessary to resolve the large empty bandwidth in between fields . in this scheme ,",
    "the total electric field is the sum of the four individual fields , each having a slowly varying amplitude function @xmath104 centered around a carrier wave of frequency @xmath105 ; @xmath106 where @xmath28 denotes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",

    "we then use these pump solutions in the second pair of equations for the weak signal fields .",

    "clearly , the perturbative solutions will not hold for conversion efficiencies approaching 100% , as we see significant alterations of the modes in figs .",

    "in this paper we studied quantum frequency translation ( qft ) by the four - wave mixing interaction of bragg scattering ( bs ) using a realistic numerical model of photonic crystal fiber and an analytical approximate solution valid for low conversion efficiency . because bs implements a quantum operator transformation analogous to that of an ordinary beam splitter ( mode coupler ) , it is noiseless ( background free ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the beam - splitter nature of bs leads to linear - optical quantum operations between weak light pulses of different central frequencies , in particular two - photon hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference @xcite .",
    "the main questions addressed were : ( 1 ) under what conditions does high - efficiency qft take place ? ( 2 ) under what conditions does high - efficiency hom interference take place ? ( 3 ) given the shapes of the pump pulses , how can one design ideal signal pulse shapes to optimize the above - mentioned processes ? ( 4 ) how are these ideal signal shapes affected by the level of the conversion efficiency for the qft ?",
    "that is , are the ideal shapes invariants for a given pump shape , or do they evolve differently at higher conversion efficiency than at low conversion efficiency ?",
    "our modeling included realistic input pump and signal fields and effects such as convection , dispersion , self - phase modulation and cross - phase modulation .",
    "this work extends previous theoretical and numerical work @xcite on these subjects not only through explicitly modeling of specific cases ( specific input signal wavepackets ) , but more generally through the determination of the green function that governs the bs process for an entire range of input signal wave packets . knowing the green function for a process enables the calculation of the signal input and output schmidt modes and corresponding singular values ( generalizations of eigenmodes and eigenvalues , respectively ) , found by the singular value decomposition of the green function .",
    "knowledge of the schmidt modes and their associated singular values enables the calculation of the effect of the bs process on the input signals without the need to further solve the pulse propagation equations .",
    "most importantly for single - photon inputs , this includes the frequency translation and two - color two - photon interference effects .",
    "it also allows for the optimization of these effects",
    ".    in particular , conditions for achieving high translation efficiency of input signal wave packets with gaussian pumps with both long ( 1000 ps ) and short ( 70 ps ) durations at a modest peak power of 400 mw were discovered by finding the green function , and then schmidt modes , of the process .",
    "these two cases represent the quasi - cw regime and pulsed regime , respectively , in regards to the translation phase - matching bandwidth of the process .",
    "the long - pumps case was found to be  non - discriminatory , \" where many schmidt modes were translated with high efficiency .",
    "therefore , this configuration of fiber and pumps would be useful for effective translation of many different input signal wave packets or in the case where an input packet is a superposition of the high - efficiency ones .",
    "in contrast , the short - pump case was found to be  discriminatory , \" where only the first few schmidt modes experienced significant translation .",
    "configurations of the discriminatory type would be most suited to applications where it is desirable for only a few types of wave packets ( ideally only one ) to experience significant translation , such as in a temporal - mode - selective add / drop filter @xcite .",
    "recently it was proposed that such a filter , or  pulse gate \" can be implemented using frequency upconversion by sum - frequency generation in an optical crystal driven by a single strong pump pulse @xcite .",
    "this process is analogous to the bs process studied here , with a major difference being that in upconversion the two signal fields being connected by frequency translation must be separated by an amount equal to the pump frequency .",
    "this limits the process to large frequency separations .",
    "the numerical scheme developed here is well suited for modeling such a process .    to gain insight into the fwm bragg scattering process",
    ", we developed an analytical perturbation solution .",
    "we find that for low efficiency qft the schmidt modes are well approximated by a set of orthogonal hermite - gaussian functions with characteristic temporal widths determined simply by group - velocity differences and the spectral width of the pumps .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the hg modes become strongly altered for high conversion , in apparent contradiction to what is argued in @xcite .",
    "also studied were the conditions for achieving a highly visible two - color photon interference .",
    "we studied two pump configurations having long ( 1000 ps ) and short ( 70 ps ) durations and a peak power ( 200 mw ) close to the optimum value for a 20-m - long fiber .",
    "similar to the high - efficiency translation cases , the long - pump case was  non - discriminatory \" and the short - pump cases was  discriminatory \" in regards to high visibility of the two - color photon interference effect .",
    "we verified numerically that for the long - pumps configuration up to about 50 percent conversion efficiency , both the input and output schmidt mode sets are very well approximated by orthogonal hermite ",
    "gauss ( hg ) function sets . for the short - pumps configuration ,",
    "the hg functions are reasonable approximations .",
    "the approximate theory on which the hg functions are based allows one to predict the schmidt - mode widths and singular values as functions of the physical parameters .    in conclusion ,",
    "qft by fwm bragg scattering appears to be a powerful and robust technique for linearly interacting two quantum fields of distinct frequencies .",
    "besides offering the ability to change the colors of single photons , it may offer other useful abilities in quantum information science , such as linear - optical quantum computing  over the rainbow \" of optical and near - ir frequencies .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf grant eccs-0802109 and by the oregon nanoscience and microtechnologies institute .",
    "we thank s. van enk for helpful comments .",
    "the probability for the occurrence of the @xmath188 and @xmath189 states requires care to derive due to the possibility that degenerate photons would be created in the green and blue frequency regions . in this case",
    "the primed variables attached to the operators can not be taken over to their unprimed counterparts ( as @xmath190 to @xmath191 was for example ) .",
    "this ambiguity can be avoided by calculating @xmath96 directly as the product of the appropriate bra and ket vectors ( similarly for @xmath97 ) . from the term corresponding to the creation of two green photons",
    "leads to an expression for @xmath96 of @xmath192 where the variables of the conjugate wavefunction are denoted with an overhead bar .",
    "the key to evaluating this expression is to utilize the field commutation relation . in the frequency variable",
    "the commutation relation is @xmath193 = \\delta(\\omega-\\omega^{'})$ ] .",
    "hence the commutation relation to be used on the innermost operators is @xmath194 this breaks the expression into two parts , and leads to the expression , employing dummy variable notation , latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : p20 }      p_{20 } = \\left|\\int d\\omega a_{gg}^{*}(l,\\omega)a_{gb}(l,\\omega ) \\right|^2 + \\int d\\omega d\\omega^ { ' }    @xmath97 is the same when @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",

    "this purely quantum mechanical term arises from the bosonic nature of photons , the operators of which obey the above - mentioned commutation relation .",
    "the second term accounts for the cases in which the two green fields are purely classical , as if these fields did not obey the quantum bosonic commutation relations .",
