    "in the recent years , there has been a large number of both experimental and theoretical studies aimed at understanding the effects of large deformations in the case of light - mass nuclei  @xcite .",

    "the results were consistent with predictions made within the macroscopic - microscopic approach of the lsd ( lublin - strasbourg drop ) model  @xcite , in which the large deformations are ascribed to the jacobi shape transition .",

    "in addition , a number of superdeformed bands of discrete @xmath5-ray transitions were discovered in selected @xmath13 @xmath6-like nuclei belonging to this mass region ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the search for extended shapes and for the jacobi transition of @xmath0ti with measurements of the lcp and gdr spectra in coincidence with evaporation residues ( er ) for the reaction @xmath2al  +  @xmath3f at a bombarding energy of @xmath4(@xmath2al )  =  144  mev . in the following the experimental results",
    "are presented and their interpretation are discussed within both the statistical @xcite and the lsd @xcite models .",
    "the experiment was performed at the vivitron tandem facility of the ires strasbourg ( france ) , using the multidetector array icare @xcite associated with a large volume ( 4@xmath144@xmath15 ) bgo detector . the @xmath0ti@xmath1 compound nucleus ( cn )",

    "the high - energy part of @xmath6-particle spectra depends on the final state level density .",
    "the level density is calculated using the rotating liquid drop model ( rldm )  @xcite and can be changed using different sets of deformability parameters .",

    "the standard rldm yrast line , which in general can be approximated by the rigid body yrast line with small deformation ( @xmath33 = 0.2 ) , results in the @xmath6-particle spectra presented in fig .  1 as dashed lines .",

    "would be required .",
    "an example of the calculations in which the agreement of the slopes of the spectra is better , even the calculated slopes are too large , is shown for @xmath23 = 20 with dotted line .",
    "these calculations were using the yrast line with the deformability parameters ( @xmath25  =  1.1@xmath40 , @xmath26  =  1.0@xmath35 ) , depicted in fig .  2 as `` quasi - hyperdeformed '' as it resembles the yrast line for the rigid body with a deformation parameter @xmath33  @xmath18  1 .",
    "this result seems to be rather unexpected .",
    "even though according to macroscopic - microscopic calculations made with the lsd model , the equilibrium deformation of the ( hot ) nucleus @xmath0ti can be characterized by such extreme deformations at the highest possible spins of the reaction ( i @xmath18 34 - 36 ) , the cooling process performed through particle emission is expected to lead to much smaller deformations .",
    "indeed , at low temperatures shell effects play a prominent role and tend to stabilize the nucleus in near - spherical or at best super - deformed shapes @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the case when more than one charged particle is emitted ( see the spectra for @xmath23 = 18 , 19 in fig .  1 ) .",
    "a possible explanation can be related to the time scale of the evaporation process .",
    "when many particles are evaporated , the time needed for this process can be long enough , so that the residual nucleus changes its shape to smaller deformation and the effective level density of final states can be described by the `` quasi - superdeformed '' yrast line . in contrast , if only one @xmath6-particle is being emitted ( the case for @xmath23 = 20 ) , it is possible that the residual nucleus is still in the process of changing shape .",
    "therefore the appropriate yrast line will have a shape between the shape of cn ( with @xmath33  @xmath18  1 ) , i.e. described by the `` quasi - hyperdeformed '' yrast line , and a shape of final nucleus , described by the `` quasi - superdeformed '' yrast line .",
    "such an effect can be understood as an existence of a `` dynamical hyperdeformation '' .",
    "although one can not exclude another explanation of this anomalous shape of @xmath6-particle spectra in coincidence with the residues of @xmath23 = 20 , e.g. spin dependent binding energies , it is worth to mention that analogous explanation was given for the observed @xmath6-particle spectra in the decay of @xmath41cu cn @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameters @xmath33 and @xmath5 of the minima in the potential energy surfaces , calculated with the lsd model , are presented in the fig .  2 ( right panel ) , showing the evolution of the equilibrium shape of @xmath0ti as function of spin .",
    "as angular momentum increases , the nucleus originally spherical at i = 0 acquires some oblate deformation , corresponding to an elongation of up to @xmath33  @xmath18  0.3 for i = 26 . beyond 26 @xmath19",
    ", the jacobi shape transition sets in : the nucleus becomes triaxial with the elongation parameter increasing up to values of @xmath33  @xmath42  1 for i = 38 , and the fission finally takes place at i  @xmath18  40 .",
    "ti at different spins simulated by the thermal shape fluctuation model based on the potential energies from the lsd model.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : maj_fig3 ]    the lsd potential energy surfaces constituted also a basis for the thermal shape fluctuation method to compute the gdr strength functions @xcite , presented in fig .",
    "3 . for the oblate regime below i",
    "= 26 the calculated gdr line shape has the form of a broad lorentzian distribution . for the jacobi regime (",
    "i  @xmath42  26 ) the line shape is characteristically split forming a narrow low - energy component around 10 mev , and a broad structure ranging from 15 to 27 mev .",
    "this splitting is a consequence of both the elongated shape of the nucleus undergoing the jacobi shape transition and strong coriollis effects @xcite which additionally split the low energy component and shift a part of its strength down to 10  mev .",
    "such fragmented gdr strength function was indeed experimentally observed for @xmath0ti at highest spins in the euroball+hector experiment @xcite .",
    "-ray spectrum measured in coincidence with the recoils possessing @xmath23 = 18 , 19 and 20 , together with the best fit cascade calculations in which the `` quasi - superdeformed '' yrast line was used and the gdr parameters that fit the spectrum were @xmath43 = 18.5 mev , @xmath44 = 14 mev and @xmath45 = 1 .",
    "right : the extracted gdr strength function ( points ) together with the lsd model prediction ( line ) for i  @xmath42  20.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : maj_fig4 ]    in the present experiment there was only very limited way to select the gdr decay related to the highest spins , namely by selecting the coincidences with residues possessing highest @xmath23 = 20 .",
    "this was sufficient for the @xmath6-particle channel selection although the statistics of the gdr @xmath5-decay was very low .",
    "therefore in order to perform the statistical model analysis the sum of coincidences with @xmath23 ranging from 18 to 20 was used . the resulting high energy @xmath5-ray spectrum is shown in fig .  4 ( left panel ) , together with the cascade calculations in which the gdr parameters were fitted .",
    "the extracted gdr strength function is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the data do not show any distinct low energy component , but this is consistent with the lsd model prediction , when one takes into account the fact that this spectrum consists of contributions from a broad spin window ( @xmath42  20 @xmath19 ) .",
    "the spectra of @xmath6-particles emitted from hot rotating @xmath0ti evidence the large deformations ( @xmath33  @xmath18  0.6 ) that are involved in the evaporation process .",
    "the process of emission of a single @xmath6-particle suggests even larger deformations linked to the effect of `` dynamical hyperdeformation '' .",
    "the gdr spectra are also consistent with such large deformations .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of the effective high - spin selectivity in the experiment does not allow us to observe the predicted gdr splitting . however , the global properties of the gdr spectrum of fig",
    ".  4 are fairly well reproduced by the lsd model .",
    "this type of experiments will be attractive with the availability of the intense radioactive beams , since in the more neutron rich nuclei , produced in fusion - evaporation reactions , higher spins can be reached , enabling stronger population of the `` jacobi shapes '' window .    this work has been supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education ( grant no . 1 p03b 030 30 ) .",
