    "in recent years , the advent of spintronics has motivated the search for methods of generating spin currents with little or no dissipation .",
    "one class of proposals involves designing an adiabatic pump in which the cyclic variation of some control parameters results in the transfer of spin across an otherwise insulating structure@xcite .",
    "such a spin pump has been realized in quantum dot structures@xcite .",
    "a second class of proposals involves using the spin hall effect to generate a spin current using an electric field @xcite .",
    "interest in this approach has been stimulated by the experimental observation of spin accumulation induced by the spin hall effect in doped gaas structures@xcite . in these experiments",
    "the spin current is accompanied by a dissipative charge current .",
    "this motivated murakami , nagaosa and zhang@xcite to propose an interesting class  spin hall insulator \" materials which are band insulators that have , according to a kubo formula , a large spin hall conductivity .",
    "however , the spin current which flows in the bulk of these materials is not a transport current , and can not be simply measured or extracted . a crucial ingredient for the generation of transport currents",
    "is the existence of gapless extended edge states .",
    "such states are generically not present in the spin hall insulators@xcite .",
    "motivated by the spin hall insulator proposal , we introduced a model of graphene in which the symmetry allowed spin orbit interactions lead to a quantum spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "a related phase has been proposed for @xmath1 in the presence of a uniform strain gradient@xcite .",
    "this phase is characterized by a bulk excitation gap and gapless edge excitations . in the special case where the spin @xmath2 is conserved",
    ", this phase can be viewed as two copies of the quantum hall state introduced by haldane@xcite .",
    "the phase persists , however , in the presence of spin nonconserving interactions as well as disorder@xcite .",
    "time reversal symmetry protects the gapless edge states when electron interactions are weak , though strong interactions can open an energy gap at the edge accompanied by time reversal symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "we argued that the quantum spin hall phase is distinguished from a band insulator by a @xmath0 topological index@xcite , which is a property of the bulk system defined on a torus .",
    "we suggested a formula for this index in terms of the bloch wavefunctions .",
    "however , the physical meaning of this formula and its relation to the edge states was not explicit .    when placed on a cylinder ( or equivalently a corbino disk ) , the quantum spin hall system defines a kind of adiabatic pump as a function of the magnetic flux threading the cylinder . in the case where @xmath2 is conserved , advancing the flux by one flux quantum results in the transfer of spin @xmath3 from one end of the cylinder to the other",
    "this is a spin pump , whose operation is analogous to a charge pump which could be constructed with a quantum hall state on a cylinder . as envisioned by thouless and co workers in the 1980s@xcite , the adiabatic charge pumping process",
    "is characterized by a topological invariant - the chern number - which is an integer that determines the quantized charge that is pumped in the course of a cycle .",
    "equivalently , the chern number provides a topological classification of the two dimensional quantum hall state@xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 is conserved , similar ideas can be used to describe a quantized adiabatic spin pump@xcite .",
    "a local conservation law is essential for this type of topological pumping process . for a finite system with closed ends , the eigenstates before and after a complete cycle must be distinct .",
    "this means that two energy levels must cross in the course of the cycle . in the case of the charge pump ,",
    "that level crossing is protected by local charge conservation because the two states differ in their eigenvalue of the charge at each end . in the absence of a conservation law there",
    "will , in general , be no level crossings , and the system will be in the same state before and after the cycle .    unlike charge , spin does not obey a fundamental conservation law , so unless spin non conserving processes can be made very small it is not possible to define an adiabatic spin pump that works analogously to the thouless charge pump . nonetheless , in ref .",
    "we argued that _ time reversal symmetry _ introduces a conservation law which allows for a topological pumping process .",
    "specifically , we showed that for a quantum spin hall state on a cylinder the eigenstates before and after adiabatic flux insertion are orthogonal , and can not be connected by any local time reversal invariant operator .",
    "when a second flux is added , however , the system returns to its original ground state . in this sense , the quantum spin hall effect defines a  @xmath0 pump \" . in one cycle",
    "there is no charge transferred between the two ends .",
    "since spin is not conserved , the two states can not be distinguished by a spin quantum number ( though the expectation value of the spin at the end changes by a non quantized amount ) .",
    "the question therefore arises : what is it that is pumped between the ends of the cylinder ?    in this paper we examine this issue carefully and introduce a class of one dimensional models that exhibit a similar pumping behavior that is protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xmath0 spin pump \" is analogous to the quantum spin hall effect in the same sense that the charge pump is analogous to the ordinary quantum hall effect .",
    "we introduce the concept of the _ time reversal polarization _ , a @xmath0 quantity which signals whether or not a time reversal invariant one dimensional system has a kramers degeneracy associated with its ends .",
    "we show that the change in the time reversal polarization in the course of an adiabatic cycle is related to a @xmath0 topological invariant which distinguishes a @xmath0 spin pump from a trivial cycle of an insulator which pumps nothing .",
    "this @xmath0 invariant is equivalent to the invariant introduced in ref . to characterize the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "the present work , however , provides an alternative formulation which clarifies both the physical and mathematical meaning of the invariant .",
    "we study a family of one dimensional hamiltonians which have a bulk energy gap and a length which is much larger than the exponential attenuation length associated with that gap .",
    "we suppose the hamiltonian depends continuously on a  pumping parameter \" @xmath4 , satisfying the following properties : @xmath5 = h[t ] , \\label{cond1}\\ ] ] @xmath6 = \\theta h[t ] \\theta^{-1 } , \\label{cond2}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the time reversal operator . in the case that the one dimensional system corresponds to a two dimensional system on a cylinder @xmath8 may be viewed as the magnetic flux threading the cylinder in units of the flux quantum . in the course of the cycle time reversal symmetry",
    "is broken .",
    "however , the second constraint ensures that the system passes through _ two _ distinct points @xmath9 and @xmath10 at which the hamiltonian is time reversal invariant . condition ( [ cond2 ] ) may be relaxed somewhat , but it is essential that there exist two distinct time reversal invariant points @xmath11 and @xmath12 where ( [ cond2 ] ) is locally valid .",
    "the existence of two such points plays a crucial role in the topological classification of the pumping cycle .",
    "in particular , we will show that pumping cycles in which @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 $ ] have different time reversal polarization are topologically distinct from trivial cycles .",
    "we will begin in section ii by introducing a simple one dimensional tight binding model which exemplifies the @xmath0 spin pump .",
    "this model is closely related to a model of a spin pump that was recently introduced by shindou@xcite which may be applicable to certain spin 1/2 quantum spin chains , such as cu - benzonate and yb@xmath15as@xmath16 .",
    "this tight binding model incorporates spin non conserving spin orbit interactions and provides a concrete illustration of the @xmath0 pumping effect .",
    "in section iii we provide a general formulation of the time reversal polarization for non interacting electrons .",
    "our discussion closely parallels the theory of charge polarization@xcite , in which the charge polarization is related to the berry s phase of bloch wavefunctions .",
    "we show how the change in the time reversal polarization defines a @xmath0 topological invariant characterizing the pumping cycle .    in section",
    "iv we argue that the notion of time reversal polarization and the topological classification that follows from it can be generalized to interacting systems .",
    "we describe an interacting version of our 1d model using abelian bosonization .",
    "this provides a different formulation of the time reversal polarization , which is well defined in the presence of interactions .    in section",
    "v we conclude by addressing two issues . in va",
    "we discuss the implications of the time reversal polarization for the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "we argue that the two dimensional quantum spin hall phase is a distinct phase from a band insulator even in the presence of electron electron interactions .",
    "we then prove that this phase either has gapless edge excitations or exhibits a ground state degeneracy associated with time reversal symmetry breaking at the edge .",
    "we also comment on a proposal by sheng , weng , sheng and haldane@xcite to classify the quantum spin hall effect in terms of a chern number matrix .",
    "in vb we ask whether the @xmath0 spin pump we have defined can actually pump spin .",
    "despite the fact that the isolated pump returns to its original state after two cycles , we argue that when connected weakly to leads , the @xmath0 pump _ does _ pump spin , although the amount of spin pumped in each cycle is not quantized .    in the appendix we relate different mathematical formulations of the @xmath0 topological invariant .",
    "we begin by showing that , like the chern invariant , the @xmath0 invariant can be interpreted as an obstruction to globally defining wavefunctions , _ provided _ a constraint relating time reversed wavefunctions is enforced .",
    "we then prove that the invariant derived in this paper is equivalent to the one introduced in ref . .",
    "in this section we introduce a one dimensional tight binding model of the @xmath0 spin pump .",
    "this model is closely related to a model introduced by shindou as an adiabatic spin pump@xcite .",
    "shindou considered an antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 heisenberg chain to which two perturbations which open a gap in the excitation spectrum are added .",
    "the first term is a staggered magnetic field @xmath17 which locks the spins into a neel ordered state .",
    "the second is a staggered component to the exchange interaction @xmath18 , which leads to a dimerized state .",
    "interestingly , shindou suggested that this model may be relevant to certain @xmath19 quantum spin chains , such as cu - benzonate and yb@xmath15as@xmath16 , in which spins reside at two crystallographically inequivalent sites .",
    "he argued that in these systems @xmath17 can be controlled by applying a _ uniform _ magnetic field , and @xmath18 can be controlled with a uniform electric field .",
    "shindou showed that a cycle in which @xmath18 and @xmath17 are adiabatically varied defines a topological spin pump , which transfers @xmath20 in each cycle .",
    "the topological quantization of shindou s pump requires the conservation of @xmath2 . in general , however , @xmath2 non conserving processes are allowed by symmetry .",
    "in particular the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xmath21 ) , is allowed , and will inevitably lead to the violation of @xmath2 conservation .",
    "we will argue , however , that provided the system retains time reversal invariance when @xmath22 this system remains a @xmath0 spin pump even in the presence of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we study a non interacting electron version of the shindou model , where in addition to the spin degree of freedom we allow charge fluctuations .",
    "consider a one dimensional tight binding model with a staggered magnetic field , a staggered bond modulation as well as a time reversal invariant spin orbit interaction , @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 and @xmath27 here @xmath28 is an arbitrary vector characterizing the spin orbit interaction .",
    "this term explicitly violates the conservation of @xmath2 , playing a role similar to the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in shindou s model .",
    "we consider an adiabatic cycle in which @xmath29 since @xmath30 is odd under time reversal , while @xmath31 is even , condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is clearly satisfied . at @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "the hamiltonian is time reversal invariant .    in fig .",
    "1(a ) we depict groundstates in the strong coupling limit at representative points along the cycle . at @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath30",
    "dominates and locks the spins into a neel ordered state . at @xmath32 and @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath31 dominates , and the system is dimerized with singlet pairs of electrons occupying alternate bonds .",
    "importantly , the groundstate at @xmath36 is distinguished from the groundstate at @xmath32 by the presence of _ unpaired _ spins at each end .    when @xmath37 @xmath2 is conserved , and this model describes a spin pump . in this case",
    "@xmath38 can be decomposed into two independent periodic potentials which lock the densities of the up and down spin particles and slide in opposite directions as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "as @xmath4 evolves from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , the periodic potentials slide by one lattice constant .",
    "provided there is  space \" for the added spin at the ends , spin @xmath41 will accumulate at the end following each cycle .",
    "we wish to understand how this spin pump is modified when @xmath42 , so that @xmath2 is not conserved . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we plot the single particle energy levels for a @xmath43 site chain as a function of @xmath4 for nonzero @xmath44 .",
    "the bulk energy gap can be clearly seen with continuum states above and below .",
    "the energy levels that cross the gap are end states .",
    "each line consists of two states which are localized at opposite ends .",
    "the crossing of the end states at @xmath36 will play a critical role in what follows .",
    "when @xmath37 the degeneracy at @xmath33 is protected by spin conservation because the two states at each edge have @xmath45 .",
    "nonzero @xmath44 does _ not _ lift the degeneracy provided the hamiltonian remains time reversal invariant at @xmath33 .",
    "the two end states form a kramers doublet whose degeneracy can not be broken by any time reversal invariant perturbation .",
    "because of the level crossing at @xmath36 it is clear that a system which starts in the ground state at @xmath32 will be in an excited state at @xmath46 .",
    "however , since the end states merge with the continuum the excitation will not be localized near the edge , and bulk particle - hole pairs will be excited .",
    "this is because there is no  space \" to put the excitations at the ends . in section",
    "vb we will discuss the effect of connecting this pump to reservoirs which allow the end states to be ",
    "emptied \" without exciting bulk particle - hole pairs .",
    "for the purpose of this section , however , we will study the operation of an isolated pump by adding several sites at the ends of the chain for which @xmath30 and @xmath31 vanish .",
    "this introduces additional midgap states localized at each end , allowing the cycle to proceed without generating bulk excitations .",
    "1(c ) shows the energy levels as a function of @xmath4 with the extra sites added at each end .",
    "there are now several midgap states at each end .",
    "since all of the midgap states are localized at one end or the other , the low energy excitations of the system can be factorized as a product of excitations at each of the two ends .    in fig .",
    "1(d ) we plot for @xmath47 the energies of the lowest few many body eigenstates associated with a single end , obtained by considering particle hole excitations built from the single particle states localized at that end .",
    "though this picture was computed for non interacting electrons , it is clear that the kramers degeneracy of the groundstate at @xmath36 and @xmath48 will be robust to the addition of electron electron interactions .",
    "the first excited state at @xmath49 , @xmath40 and @xmath50 in fig .",
    "1(d ) is four fold degenerate ( the middle level coming into that point is doubly degenerate ) .",
    "this degeneracy , however , is an artifact of non interacting electrons .",
    "the degeneracy is present because there are four ways of making particle hole excitations with two pairs of kramers degenerate states .",
    "electron electron interactions , however , will in general split this degeneracy , as shown in the inset , so there will be no level crossing at @xmath46 .",
    "we thus conclude that when the isolated pump starts in its ground state at @xmath32 , it arrives in an excited state after one complete cycle at @xmath46 . after a second cycle , however , at @xmath51",
    "the system returns to its original state .",
    "for this reason , we call it a  @xmath0 pump \" .",
    "it is possible that by coupling to other degrees of freedom an _ inelastic _",
    "process ( such as emitting a phonon ) could cause the excited state to relax back to the ground state .",
    "nonetheless , there is an important distinction between this adiabatic process which generates an excited state and one that does not . in section",
    "vb we will return to this issue when we discuss connecting the pump to leads .",
    "the nontrivial operation of a single cycle depends critically on the time reversal symmetry at @xmath36 .",
    "breaking time reversal symmetry at that point leads to an avoided crossing of the energy levels , so that the system returns adiabatically to its original state at @xmath46 .    from the point of view of the end states ,",
    "the non trivial pumping effect arises because there exist kramers degenerate end states at @xmath52 , but not at @xmath49 . in the next section we show that this property is determined by the topological structure of the _ bulk _ hamiltonian , @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we introduce the time reversal polarization for non interacting electrons and show that changes in it define a topological invariant .",
    "our discussion will parallel the theory of charge polarization in insulators@xcite . in order to establish this connection and to define our notation",
    "we will therefore begin by reviewing that theory , which relates the charge polarization to the average center of wannier orbitals , which in turn are related to the berry s phase of the bloch wavefunctions .",
    "we next consider the role of kramers degeneracy in time reversal invariant systems and define a corresponding time reversal polarization in terms of the difference between the wannier centers of kramers degenerate bands .",
    "finally , we show that the _ change _ in the time reversal polarization between @xmath32 and @xmath36 of the pumping cycle defines a @xmath0 topological invariant which distinguishes a nontrivial @xmath0 pump from a trivial cycle .      consider a one dimensional system with lattice constant @xmath54 , length @xmath55 with periodic boundary conditions and @xmath56 occupied bands .",
    "the normalized eigenstates for the @xmath57th band can then be written in terms of cell periodic bloch functions as @xmath58 we may define wannier functions associated with each unit cell associated with lattice vector @xmath59 as @xmath60 the wannier functions are not unique because they depend on a gauge choice for @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to changing the phases of the individual wavefunctions , the wavefunctions can be mixed by a general @xmath62 transformation of the form @xmath63 after this transformation , @xmath61 need no longer be the individual eigenstates of the hamiltonian , but rather should be interpreted as basis vectors spanning the space spanned by the @xmath56 occupied eigenstates .",
    "the slater determinant of the @xmath56 wavefunctions is unchanged up to a phase .",
    "marzari and vanderbilt@xcite have provided a prescription for choosing @xmath64 to optimally localize the wannier wavefunctions . here , however , we are concerned with the total charge polarization , which is insensitive to the details of @xmath64 .",
    "the polarization is given by the sum over all of the bands of the center of charge of the wannier states associated with @xmath65 , and may be written@xcite @xmath66 where the @xmath67 berry s connection is given by @xmath68 the integral is over the brillouin zone from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "if we require that the wavefunction @xmath71 be defined continuously in the reduced zone scheme , so that @xmath72 then @xmath73 , and the integral may be considered to be on a _ closed _ loop , despite the fact that @xmath74 is discontinuous from @xmath75 to @xmath70@xcite . under @xmath62 a transformation which preserves this continuity @xmath76 is invariant up to a lattice constant . for a transformation in which the @xmath67 phase of @xmath77 advances by @xmath78 when @xmath79 advances around the brillouin zone @xmath80 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the polarization can only be defined up to a lattice vector .",
    "_ changes _ in the polarization induced by a continuous change in the hamiltonian @xmath81 $ ] are , however , well defined .",
    "thus , if the wave functions @xmath82 are defined _ continuously _ between @xmath83 and @xmath84 for all @xmath79 in the brillouin zone , then we may write @xmath85-p_\\rho[t_1 ] = { 1\\over { 2\\pi}}\\left [ \\oint_{c_2}dk\\   { \\cal a}(t , k ) -\\oint_{c_1}dk \\ { \\cal a}(t , k ) \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the loop @xmath87 to @xmath70 for fixed @xmath88 . using stokes theorem , this can be written as an integral of the berry curvature @xmath89 over the surface @xmath90 of the cylinder spanned by @xmath79 and @xmath4 bounded by @xmath91 and @xmath92 : @xmath85-p_\\rho[t_1 ] = { 1\\over { 2\\pi } } \\int_{\\tau_{12 } } dt dk\\   { \\cal f}(t , k ) .",
    "\\label{prho2}\\ ] ]    for a periodic cycle @xmath93=h[t]$ ] , the change in the polarization over one cycle , @xmath94 is given by the integral in ( [ prho2 ] ) over the entire torus defined by @xmath4 and @xmath79 .",
    "this quantity is an integer and defines the first chern number associated with the wavefunction @xmath82 on the torus .",
    "the chern number characterizes the charge pumped in each cycle . for a cycle which satisfies the time reversal constraint in eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) , @xmath95 , so the chern number is equal to zero .",
    "consider now a time reversal invariant system .",
    "the time reversal operator has the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 is spin operator and @xmath98 is complex conjugation .",
    "since @xmath99 for spin 1/2 electrons , it follows from kramers theorem that every bloch state at wavevector @xmath79 is degenerate with a time reversed bloch state .",
    "therefore , the energy bands come in pairs , which are degenerate at the two time reversal invariant points @xmath100 and @xmath70 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . note that in the presence of spin orbit interactions these bands can _ not _ be labeled with spin quantum numbers .    in section iiia",
    "we related the charge polarization as the sum of the wannier centers of all of the bands .",
    "kramer s theorem guarantees , however that the wannier states come in kramer s degenerate pairs , in which each pair has the same center .",
    "the idea is therefore to keep track of the center of _ one _ of the degenerate wannier states per pair by defining a  partial polarization \" .",
    "this will contain more information than eq .",
    "( [ prho ] ) , which is the sum over both states .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that there are no degeneracies other than those required by time reversal symmetry .",
    "therefore , the @xmath56 eigenstates may be divided into @xmath101 pairs which satisfy @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",

    "3(a ) depicts the centers of the occupied wannier orbitals as a function of @xmath4 . at @xmath147 and @xmath40",

    "however , in going from @xmath32 to @xmath36 the wannier states  switch partners \" . in this process , the time reversal polarization , which tracks the difference between the positions of the time reversed wannier states changes by one .",
    "in addition , this switching results in the appearance of an unpaired occupied wannier state at each end .",
    "since the wannier states come in pairs , there must be twofold kramers degeneracy associated with each end - resulting in a total degeneracy of four .",
    "when the system evolves from @xmath36 to @xmath46 , there is another switch , and the time reversal polarization returns to its original value .",
    "however , since @xmath81 = \\theta h[t - t]\\theta^{-1}$ ] , the system with open ends does not return to its original state at @xmath32 but its ends are in an excited state because of the level crossing at @xmath36 .",

    "we will relate different mathematical formulations of this invariant .",
    "we will first show that it can be interpreted as an obstruction to defining continuous wavefunctions provided an additional constraint relating the wavefunctions at time reversed points is enforced .",

    "the non trivial @xmath0 invariant , however , does _ not _ guarantee gapless edge states . as shown by wu",
    "et al.@xcite and xu et al.@xcite , when the interactions at the edge are sufficiently strong the edge can undergo a transition which opens a gap .",
    "the considerations of this paper allow us to prove that _ either _ there are gapless edge excitations _ or _ there is a ground state degeneracy at the edge associated with the breaking of time reversal symmetry .    to establish this proposition ,",
    "consider the many particle eigenstates of the quantum spin hall phase on a cylinder as a function of the magnetic flux through the cylinder .",
    "when the radius @xmath59 of the cylinder large , then the @xmath207 change in the energy of the many particle eigenstates when the one half a flux is inserted will be much less than any energy gap .",

    "when @xmath218 is conserved this is certainly correct , and the chern number matrix can be viewed as independent chern numbers for the up and down spins .",
    "however , when spatial symmetries are relaxed and spin is not conserved this distinction is no longer meaningful .",
    "the two phases discussed above are in fact the _ same _ phase because they can be continuously transformed into one another without closing the gap . specifically , consider the more general spin orbit interaction which preserves the energy gap : @xmath220 when the unit vector @xmath221 is continuously varied from @xmath222 to @xmath223 the two  phases \" are connected .",
    "of course , the process of connecting these phases requires the breaking of the @xmath224 lattice symmetry of graphene .",

    "what happens to these integers when the continuous path in eq .",
    "( [ path ] ) is adiabatically followed ?",

    "in contrast , if the spin phase twist is spread out over the circumference , changing @xmath175 changes the hamiltonian by an amount of order @xmath192 .",
    "the spectrum need not be close to that of the physical hamiltonian .    we conclude that the additional topological structure implied by the chern number matrix is a property of the _ boundary _ where the twisted phase condition is imposed rather than a property of the bulk two dimensional phase .",

    "the eigenstates of the pump maintain their integrity , though coupling to the reservoirs allows transitions between different states .",

    "the difficulty is coming up with a cycle in an insulating material for which @xmath238 is not very small .",
    "the @xmath0 pump accomplishes this by guaranteeing that there is a resonance in the reflection matrix , which occurs when the kramers degenerate end state appears .",

    "thus , one can not view the spin as being pumped along the length of the pump .",
