    "the two major variants of lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) are the `` euclidean '' formulation of wilson @xcite , and the `` hamiltonian '' version of kogut and susskind @xcite . in the euclidean rgime ,",
    "classical monte carlo simulations have proved to be extremely powerful in extracting quantitative predictions from the theory , as first shown by creutz @xcite .",
    "this approach is preferred by an overwhelming majority of lattice gauge theorists at the present time .",
    "the hamiltonian formulation is still worthy of study , however .",
    "it can provide a valuable check of universality , for instance .",
    "lattice gauge theory relies on the fundamental assumption that quantities such as mass ratios calculated in the continuum limit ( a critical point of the lattice model ) must be ` universal ' , i.e.  independent of the microscopic lattice structure or space - time formulation .",
    "there is not much real doubt that this is correct , but it is important to provide checks where possible @xcite .",
    "another reason is that many techniques imported from quantum many - body theory and condensed matter physics can be employed in this arena , which may give useful results .",
    "examples include the strong - coupling series approach @xcite , the @xmath1-expansion @xcite , the coupled - cluster method @xcite , and others .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that monte carlo simulations will provide the most robust and accurate numerical techniques in this area also .",
    "our aim in this paper is to discuss some further applications of these quantum monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "the use of quantum monte carlo methods in hamiltonian lgt has a long and somewhat chequered history , and lags a good ten years behind the euclidean developments .",
    "the first calculations used a strong - coupling basis involving discrete `` electric field '' link variables , and a `` projector monte carlo '' approach @xcite , which used the hamiltonian itself to project out the ground state .",
    "a later version of this was the `` stochastic truncation '' approach of allton et al .",
    "@xcite . using this approach",
    "one can successfully compute string tensions and mass gaps for abelian models @xcite . for non - abelian models ,",
    "however , some problems arose @xcite .",
    "using an electric field representation for the link variables and a robson - webber recoupling scheme @xcite at the vertices requires the use of clebsch - gordan coefficients or 6@xmath2-symbols , which are not known to high order for @xmath3 ; and furthermore , the ` minus sign ' problem rears its head , in that destructive interference occurs between different paths to the same final state",
    ". it may well be that a better choice of strong - coupling basis , such as the ` loop representation ' , might avoid these problems ; but this has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "heys and stump @xcite and chin et al .",
    "@xcite pioneered the use of `` greens function monte carlo '' ( gfmc ) or `` diffusion monte carlo '' techniques in hamiltonian lgt , in conjunction with a weak - coupling representation involving continuous gauge field link variables .",
    "this was successfully adapted to non - abelian yang - mills theories @xcite , with no minus sign problem arising . in this representation , however , one is simulating the wave function in gauge field configuration space by a discrete ensemble or density of random walkers : it is not possible to determine the derivatives of the gauge fields for each configuration , or to enforce gauss s law explicitly , and the ensemble always relaxes back to the ground state sector . hence one can not compute the string tensions and mass gaps directly as hamiltonian eigenvalues corresponding to ground states in different sectors , as one does in the strong - coupling representation .",
    "chin , long and robson @xcite thus resorted to `` variational monte carlo '' ( vmc ) techniques to compute mass gaps .",
    "they obtained some reasonable results ; but this approach always suffers from the major drawback that there is an unknown systematic error in the results , due to their dependence on the form of the variational wave function which is chosen .",
    "it appears , therefore , that to make unbiased measurements of mass gaps in the weak - coupling representation one is forced back to the more laborious approach used in euclidean calculations : namely , to measure an appropriate correlation function , and estimate the mass gap as the inverse of the correlation length . in ref .",
    "@xcite the gfmc method was tested on the ( 2 + 1)d u(1 ) model using a `` secondary amplitude '' technique to compute expectation values : but this proves to be expensive and prone to bias @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will show how the standard ` forward - walking ' technique used in many - body theory @xcite can be used for this purpose .",
    "the forward - walking method has already been applied to lattice spin models by runge @xcite and samaras and hamer @xcite .",
    "here we apply it to the compact @xmath0 yang - mills theory in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , which has been a standard test - bed for hamiltonian lgt .    a brief discussion of the @xmath0 model is given in section ii .",
    "our monte carlo methods are outlined in section iii .",
    "the gfmc method is briefly summarized , and then the forward - walking method for estimating expectation values is discussed , together with a technique for measuring timelike correlations . in section",

    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "in a weak coupling basis the hamiltonian for the compact @xmath0 lgt in ( 2 + 1)d is given by @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gauge field variable on link @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the plaquette variable for a lattice plaquette @xmath8 , formed by the four links @xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .

    "this is an interesting model , which possesses some important similarities with qcd ( for a more extensive review , see for example ref .",
    "if one takes the ` naive ' continuum limit at a fixed energy scale , one regains the simple continuum theory of non - interacting photons @xcite ; but if one renormalizes or rescales in the standard way so as to maintain the mass gap constant , then one obtains a confining theory of free massive bosons , as discussed by polyakov @xcite , and proven by gpfert and mack @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian version of the model has been well studied by a variety of methods : some of the more recent include series expansions @xcite , finite - lattice techniques @xcite , the @xmath1-expansion @xcite , and coupled - cluster techniques @xcite , as well as qmc @xcite .",
    "quite accurate estimates have been obtained for the string tension and mass gaps , which can be used as comparisons for our monte carlo results .",

    "the first term in ( [ eq12 ] ) is the `` drift '' term , and the second is the `` diffusion '' term .",

    ", the trial energy @xmath43 is adjusted to compensate for any change in the total weight of all walkers in the ensemble ; and a `` branching '' process is carried out , so that walkers with weight greater than ( say ) 2 are split into two new walkers , while any two walkers with weight less than ( say ) 1/2 are combined into one , chosen randomly according to weight from the originals .",
    "this procedure of `` runge smoothing '' @xcite maximizes statistical accuracy by keeping the weights of all the walkers within fixed bounds , while mimimizing any fluctuations in the total weight due to the branching process .",
    "when equilibrium is reached after many sweeps through the lattice , the average value of the trial energy @xmath19 will give an estimate of the ground - state energy @xmath44 , and the weight density of the ensemble in configuration space will be proportional to @xmath45 . various corrections due to the finite time interval @xmath37 have been ignored in this discussion , and the limit @xmath46 must be taken in some fashion to eliminate such corrections .    in the simulations presented here ,",

    "that is , the uncorrelated single plaquette trial function used in @xcite has been extended to include a _ correlated _ term . in the single plaquette case ( @xmath52 )",
    "it is straightforward to determine the optimal value for @xmath48 @xcite . for the correlated case ( @xmath53 )",
    ", the optimum values for @xmath48 and @xmath49 must be found by means of a separate variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculation , where the variational energy @xmath54 is minimised .",
    "the procedure is described in @xcite where a six- parameter variational wave function was used to estimate the mass gaps in the @xmath0 model at the vmc level . in short ,",
    "one samples the local trial energy over configurations @xmath55 randomly generated by a metropolis procedure , distributed with respect to the weight function @xmath56 .",
    "a downhill simplex method was used to perform the minimisation . to this end",
    "@xmath57 was evaluated in a region centered around a guessed minimum @xmath58 using the reweighting procedure described in @xcite , whereby uncorrelated configurations generated with respect to the weight function @xmath59 were reweighted to give a distribution corresponding to the required weight function for a pair @xmath60 in the neighbourhood of @xmath58 .",
    "this procedure was iterated until the minimum @xmath58 converged .",
    "we used 100,000 independent configurations on an @xmath61 lattice to determine @xmath57 .",
    "this allowed the optimal @xmath48 and @xmath49 to be fixed to within around 1% .",
    "though it is possible to optimise @xmath48 and @xmath49 for each lattice size , for a given value of the coupling @xmath62 , we used the same values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 for all lattice sizes @xmath10 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 used are listed in table [ table0 ] .",
    "the use of a correlated trial wave function is expected to markedly decrease the variance of estimators and the amount of branching in the population smoothing process , particularly in the physically interesting weak coupling regime ( @xmath62 large ) . moreover , because the trial function is closer to the true ground state , fewer forward walking iterations ( see section [ subsec : for ] ) are required in order to derive converged estimators for correlation functions .",
    "these advantages come at a price in that updating of gfmc configurations becomes more complicated : the local trial energy is @xmath63 and the quantum force term is given by @xmath64 here , @xmath65,",

    "[ fig1](b )",
    ". these expressions are more difficult to compute than in the single parameter ( @xmath52 ) case",
    ". however , the increased complexity is easily offset by the gains from variance reduction .",
    "the quickest method of estimating an expectation value @xmath69 is simply to form the weighted average of @xmath70 over the ensemble of random walkers ( we assume q is diagonal in the chosen basis , for simplicity ) .",
    "this produces an estimate according to the distribution @xmath71 , rather than @xmath72 .",
    "the estimate can be perturbatively improved @xcite , but there remains an unknown systematic error due to the dependence on the trial function @xmath73 .",
    "for this reason , we have preferred to use the so - called `` forward - walking '' method for estimating expectation values .",
    "the forward - walking method is a robust technique for estimating expectation values @xcite , based on the following equation @xcite for an operator @xmath70 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the evolution operator for time @xmath37 , and @xmath76 is the same operator in the similarity transformed basis .",
    "again we have assumed that the operator @xmath70 is diagonal in the basis of plaquette variables @xmath77 .",
    "this equation is implemented by @xcite the following procedure :    * starting from the trial state , iterate until equilibrium is achieved , then begin a measurement ; * record the value @xmath78 for each walker ( `` ancestor '' ) at the beginning of the measurement ; * propagate the ensemble as normal for @xmath79 iterations , keeping a record of the `` ancestor '' of each walker in the current population ; * take the weighted average of the @xmath78 with respect to the weights of the descendants of @xmath80 after the @xmath79 iterations , using sufficient iterations @xmath79 that the estimate reaches a ` plateau ' .",
    "this procedure has been tested for the magnetization in the 2d lattice heisenberg model by runge @xcite , and for correlation functions in the 1d transverse ising model by samaras and hamer @xcite , and works very well .",
    "the drawback to the procedure is that after a large number of iterations @xmath79 many of the `` ancestors '' will die out , leaving no descendants , which leads to a progressive loss of statistical accuracy .",
    "thus it is even more crucial in this connection to use a good guiding wavefunction @xmath73 so as to minimize `` branching '' .      in order to estimate mass gaps in this model ,",
    "we have again used the forward - walking technique to measure correlations between operators at different times .",
    "the mass gaps can then be estimated from the decay constants for these correlation functions .",
    "a timelike correlator @xmath81 can be found from the following equations : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "this can be implemented in much the same way as an expectation value ( assuming both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are diagonal in the weak - coupling representation ) . at the beginning of the measurement ,",

    "( [ subsec : for ] ) . then allow the ensemble to propagate for time @xmath88 , _ with the branching process turned off _ so that each state retains its identity . at the end of time @xmath88 ,",

    "propagate each state for a further @xmath79 iterations as before , and then average , weighting each ` ancestor ' state according to the forward - walking prescription of sec .",
    "( [ subsec : for ] ) .",
    "simulations were carried out for @xmath89 lattices up to @xmath90 sites , using runs of 10,000 walkers over 50,000 iterations . at each iteration several sweeps of the lattice were performed , after which runge smoothing ( the branching ( combining ) of high ( low ) weight walkers ) was imposed on the walker population .",
    "the average percentage of walkers branched / combined per iteration depends on a number of factors : clearly , the time step @xmath37 and number of lattice sweeps performed per iteration can be adjusted in order to control the extent of the branching .",
    "we wish to choose values of @xmath37 which are sufficiently small that time discretization errors can be made negligible .",
    "furthermore , the number of sweeps performed per iteration was chosen so that essentially uncorrelated measurements could be made roughly every 150 iterations .",
    "we found that , for the lattice sizes @xmath10 and couplings @xmath62 considered , this could be achieved in such a way that on average no more than 10% of the walkers were branched / combined per iteration .",
    "however , the extent of the smoothing per iteration depends on the quality of the variational guiding function .",
    "generally , the two - parameter guiding function ( [ eq13 ] ) works better for smaller couplings @xmath62 and smaller lattice sizes @xmath10 . under the most strained conditions considered ( @xmath91 , @xmath90 ) around 10% of the walkers",
    "were branched / combined per iteration for the values of @xmath37 chosen and the number of sweeps per iteration required to get independent measurements , whereas for @xmath92 the ratio was a fraction of a percent .",

    "two values of the time step @xmath37 were used , differing by a factor of 5 ( e.g.  @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "the number of sweeps performed for the smaller @xmath37 value was 5 times as large as that for the larger value and as a result measurements were equally uncorrelated in the two cases .",
    "the typical number of sweeps used per iteration , e.g.  for @xmath95 and @xmath94 was 1 and 5 respectively .",

    "as with the wilson loops , two values of the time step @xmath37 were used and linear extrapolation was used to obtain @xmath148 estimates of the correlators . again , the two values of @xmath37 used differed by a factor of 5 , and 5 times as many lattice sweeps were performed per iteration for the smaller @xmath37 so that the `` physical '' times @xmath88 over which the correlations @xmath149 were measured were the same ( i.e.  @xmath150 was kept fixed ) .    a typical plot of the resulting estimates for the timelike correlation function @xmath149 , as a function of @xmath88 , is shown in fig .  [ fig10 ] for the antisymmetric correlator with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath149 shows a smooth exponential decay with @xmath88 .",
    "defining an ` effective mass ' for each pair of points by @xmath153 , % \\ ] ] one finds that the effective mass decreases somewhat with @xmath88 , as might be expected .",
    "ad hoc _ fit in @xmath154 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , gives a final estimate for the mass of the corresponding intermediate state .",
    "these values are listed as a function of lattice size in table [ table2 ] for couplings @xmath151 , 1 and 2 . for the higher couplings the exponential decay is so slow that we have been unable to obtain useful results for the mass .",
    "to do so would require measurements to be made over substantially larger time scales with significantly greater accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , our results were not sufficiently accurate to sensibly resolve the form of the lattice size dependence for the couplings studied . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we list results of estimates of the bulk mass from other sources . it can be seen that for the couplings considered , the agreement between methods is reasonable .",
    "in this paper we have shown how the standard ` forward - walking ' methods of quantum many - body theory @xcite can be used to calculate expectation values and correlation functions in hamiltonian lattice gauge theory .",
    "accurate values for the wilson loops have been obtained , and their finite - size scaling behaviour has been demonstrated .",
    "the string tension can then be estimated using two - point and creutz ratios .",
    "the wilson loop values dropped away too quickly with lattice size to give accurate string tensions at small couplings @xmath62 ; but this problem could presumably be rectified by looking at timelike correlators  either timelike wilson loops , or timelike correlations between polyakov loops .",
    "we have also shown how mass gaps can be estimated from the exponential decay of timelike correlators .",
    "this approach is very reminiscent of the techniques used in the euclidean regime : our freedom of choice of the timelike measurement interval is akin to the choice of an anisotropic lattice in the ` timelike ' direction in the euclidean case .",
    "reasonable results have been obtained for the masses at small couplings @xmath62 , but not at large @xmath62 .",
    "the accuracy of the final results for the string tension and mass gaps is not remarkable ; but it must be recalled that this is the first time that unbiased estimates have been obtained for these quantities using a ` weak - coupling ' representation and gfmc techniques .",
    "there are no doubt many ways by which the results could be improved : for example , by the use of improved guiding wavefunctions , or improved ( `` fuzzed '' ) correlation functions , or improved hamiltonian operators .",
    "our aim here has been to ` prove the concept ' , that forward - walking techniques can give reliable estimates for the correlation functions . in future work",
    "we plan to apply similar methods to the ( 3 + 1)d @xmath3 yang - mills theory .",
    "this work is supported by the australian research council .",
