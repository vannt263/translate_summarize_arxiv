    "we live in a time when we have a seemingly excellent understanding of the universe in which we reside .",
    "the planck experiment @xcite find the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) paradigm to be an excellent fit to observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , constraining the six parameters that describe this model to percent level accuracy .",
    "the cmb decoupled from matter approximately 380,000 years after the big bang and so is sensitive to the conditions of the early universe ; subsequent interactions with the rest of the universe s energy content imprinted signatures that provide insight into the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , there exists a gap in our understanding of this evolution that needs filling : the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , during which the intergalactic medium ( igm ) transitioned from being completely neutral after the cmb decoupled to become completely ionized around a billion years after the big bang .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for a good introduction to reionization .",
    "the reionization process is complex , sensitive to many uncertainties such as the nature and evolution of the sources responsible , ( e.g @xcite ) , the degree to which the igm clumped into dense neutral sinks of ionising radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and modulation ( if any ) from feedback effects ( e.g. @xcite ) ; even the detailed timing of the overall process remains an open question .",
    "given this uncertainty , it is vital that we fully explore all possible aspects of this process so that our interpretation of reionization related observations are well informed .",
    "we have some observational constraints on the epoch of reionization .",
    "thomson scattering of cmb photons by free electrons produced during reionization wash out temperature fluctuations and induce large scale polarization anisotropies .",
    "this provides constraints on the integral optical depth to the cmb last scattering surface , indicating that reionization must have been under way by @xmath1 @xcite ; this assumes instantaneous reionization , which is unlikely to be a realistic scenario .",
    "measurements from the thermal history of the igm are consistent with this figure @xcite .",
    "measurements of the lyman-@xmath2 forest in high redshift quasars indicate that reionization was finished by @xmath3 @xcite and the detection of a lyman-@xmath2 damping wing and small proximity zone in the most distant known quasar at @xmath4 is consistent with an igm neutral fraction of more than 10% @xcite .",
    "the existing constraints from quasars have been bolstered by hints from an apparent deficit of lyman-@xmath2 emitters that the neutral fraction is above 10% by @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "to improve constraints on the epoch of reionization , work is under way to exploit the weak imprint of the hi 21-cm spectral line on the cmb .",
    "this transition results from a spin flip in neutral hydrogen s lowest energy level , corresponding to a rest - frame wavelength @xmath6 cm and frequency @xmath7 mhz @xcite . as is usual in radio observations , radiation intensity @xmath8",
    "is described in terms of brightness temperature , @xmath9 , defined such that @xmath10 ; @xmath11 is the planck black - body spectrum and is well approximated by the rayleigh - jeans formula at the frequencies relevant to reionization studies .",
    "the measured quantity is the differential brightness temperature @xmath12 along a line of sight , where @xmath13 is the temperature of the cmb .",
    "this differential brightness temperature evolves according to @xcite , @xmath14\\\\ & \\times \\left(\\frac{1+z}{10}\\frac{0.15}{\\omega_{\\rm m}h^2}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm b}h^2}{0.023}\\right ) \\rm mk \\,.\\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : brighttemp } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    this quantity is dependent on the neutral fraction of hydrogen @xmath15 , the matter overdensity @xmath16 , line of sight velocity gradient @xmath17 , hubble parameter @xmath18 , matter density parameter @xmath19 , and baryon density parameter @xmath20 ; @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the critical density required for flat universe .",
    "the differential temperature also depends on the gas spin temperature @xmath23 , which measures the occupation levels of the two hyperfine energy levels involved in the hi 21-cm line and determines the 21-cm optical depth @xmath24 .",
    "we will neglect this dependence by assuming @xmath25 , i.e. the neutral gas has been heated well above the cmb for the redshift range considered @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite possible that spin - temperature fluctuations may be influential during reionization @xcite , we defer this question to future work . for a comprehensive review of the 21-cm line we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are many radio telescopes operating , under construction , or in the design stages that aim to measure the 21-cm line , e.g. the murchison wide - field array ( mwa ) , the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the precision array to probe epoch of reionization ( paper ) , the giant meter - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , and the square kilometre array ( ska ) .",
    "all aim to detect radio fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm signal that correspond to varying levels of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the signal from reionization will only be probed at a statistical level by pre - ska telescopes .",
    "next generation instruments , such as ska , will make detailed maps of the 21-cm signal , enabling the measurement of hydrogen s properties out to @xmath26 .",
    "such observations will constrain the properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and therefore the cumulative effect of all sources of light .",
    "there has been much focus on the statistics of the 21-cm signal produced by the process of reionization , along with their detectability by future observations ; previous studies have looked at the power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) , the probability density function ( pdf ) and its moments ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the difference pdf ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly because we will be limited to statistical measures in the near future , but even with the precision of ska , statistics will play a vital role in connecting theory to observation .",
    "despite the consensus of different observations that we are observing the end of reionization at @xmath27 , the effect of absorption systems casts uncertainty on this by adjusting the mean free path at high redshifts .",
    "the nature of such absorbers could also strongly affect the morphology and environment of the ionized regions throughout reionization @xcite .    in this work we test the sensitivity of various statistics to different morphological characteristics of ionized regions that might have formed during reionization .",
    "we take 21cmfast @xcite as our reference model , the properties of which are large ionized regions around the over - dense regions containing sources .",
    "we then construct three contrasting toy models : one with small ionized bubbles in over - dense regions ; one with small ionized bubbles in under - dense regions ; and another with large ionized bubbles in under - dense regions .",
    "the truth will likely be a combination of such properties , with large - scale inside - out behaviour contrasted by recombination effects producing outside - in behaviour on smaller scales , e.g @xcite . by examining the statistics of the extreme models described in this work , we are able to tease apart the effects of each property , and therefore understand the strengths and limitations of each statistic .",
    "we examine the power spectrum , 1-dimensional pdf , skewness and variance of 21-cm maps , as well as the maps themselves ; we place emphasis on the model dependent differences in these statistics . to approximate instrumental effects we smooth and re - sample the maps according to the likely instrumental resolution of mwa , lofar and ska .",
    "errors induced by instrumental noise are then approximated by assuming independent but identically distributed random gaussian noise with zero mean on each pixel and propagating these brightness - temperature errors on to our statistics .",
    "finally , the variability in the statistics caused by cosmic variance is estimated by sub - sampling .    this rest of this paper",
    "is structured as follows : in section [ sec : modeldesc ] we detail the four models we use to simulate the different reionization scenarios ; in section [ sec : toymodel ] we construct an illustrative toy model for the pdf of the neutral - fraction maps and compare the moments of this toy model with those measured from our four model simulations ; we then move on to maps of brightness temperature , first looking at the statistics of clean maps in section [ sec : cleanstats ] ; then , in section [ sec : noisystats ] , we study the statistics of noisy maps that mimic instrumental effects ; we look at the limitations imposed by cosmic variance in section [ sec : cosvar ] ; and finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we discuss our conclusions . unless stated otherwise all lengths are co - moving . throughout",
    "we assume a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology as constrained by planck , adopting @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we utilise four simulations to mimic the behaviour of different plausible ways in which ionized bubbles might have evolved with time .",
    "our aim here is not to produce a detailed and accurate simulation of reionization , instead the qualitatively different models that we describe in this section allow clean separation of the effect that different morphological properties have on the statistics of the 21-cm brightness temperature . in reality",
    ", the characteristics we discuss in this chapter will not be as extreme and will likely be present in combination with others .",
    "table [ tbl : modelkey ] presents a summary of the physical motivation behind each model , defined by the interplay between ionization and recombination .",
    "the idea of global reionization in which over - dense regions are ionized first is preferred by current theory and simulations ; as such we use the well established semi - numerical code 21cmfast @xcite to provide a density field and our fiducial global - inside - out model .",
    "we then use this density field as a skeleton upon which to construct global - outside - in , local - inside - out and local - outside - in models .",
    "we neglect spin - temperature fluctuations so that the contributors to fluctuations in the 21-cm brightness temperature are the neutral - fraction field @xmath15 , the velocity field @xmath34 and the density field @xmath16 .",
    "the four models we use differ only in the prescription used to construct the neutral - fraction field and thus have identical density and velocity fields .",
    "the inside - out models have density fields that are anti - correlated with the neutral - fraction field , with the most dense regions being the least likely to remain neutral . in contrast , outside - in models have density fields correlated with the neutral field so that regions of extreme overdensity will instead host the most persistent neutral regions . where there is sensitivity to the global properties of the density field , larger bubbles of ionized gas will develop ; in contrast if there is only localised sensitivity then these bubbles will be much smaller .",
    "we first consider the question of bias in the estimator , finding a bias is induced by our naive estimator for the variance of the noisy data but not for the skewness .",

    "we choose to describe our estimators as @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the variance and the skewness of our brightness - temperature pdfs .",
    "we also define @xmath43 for clarity , where @xmath44 .",
