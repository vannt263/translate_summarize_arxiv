    "this paper refines and answers a question of kontsevich  @xcite inspired by homological mirror symmetry . it also contributes to a parallel program in microlocal sheaf theory pioneered by macpherson , and advanced for example by gelfand - macpherson - vilonen  @xcite .",
    "its applications include an elementary method for calculating microlocal sheaves , or constructible sheaves with prescribed singular support .",
    "for example , as taken up in  @xcite , it allows one to establish mirror symmetry equivalences where the @xmath0-model is taken to be microlocal sheaves .",
    "kontsevich conjectured that given an exact symplectic manifold @xmath1 with conical lagrangian skeleton @xmath2 , the fukaya category of @xmath1 admits a combinatorial model as a sheaf of differential graded categories along @xmath2 .",
    "going back further , macpherson and collaborators have similarly sought a combinatorial model for microlocal sheaves ( with an emphasis on perverse sheaves ) on a legendrian @xmath3 in a contact manifold  @xmath4 akin to the exit - path description  @xcite of constructible sheaves on a stratified space .",
    "it is known in many cases and broadly expected that the fukaya category of an exact symplectic manifold is a global version of microlocal sheaves along a conical lagrangian skeleton ( which in turn admit an algebraic description as modules over a deformation quantization by a microlocal form of the riemann - hilbert correspondence  @xcite ) . our focus in this paper is the geometry of conical lagrangian singularities , or equivalently legendrian singularities , in particular the development of a combinatorial language that captures their structure .",
    "the specific category used to measure them is of secondary concern , and we will take microlocal sheaves , with their less challenging technical demands , as our working context .",
    "( there is also recent progress , for example that of abouzaid  @xcite , with an emphasis on the fukaya category . )",
    "kontsevich presented a combinatorial model of microlocal sheaves for a simple but important class of singularities , one might call  soap bubble \" or ",

    "( they are the universal deformation spaces of higher valence nodes as studied in  @xcite ) . in the paper  @xcite",
    ", we introduced a natural broader class of combinatorial singularities , called arboreal singularities , and performed a similar calculation of their microlocal sheaves . in this paper , we prove that arboreal singularities are sufficient to realize a combinatorial model for singular legendrians and hence microlocal sheaves .",
    "any legendrian singularity admits a non - characteristic deformation to a legendrian with arboreal singularities .",
    "one can view the theorem as a solution to the analogy : @xmath6 on the one hand , any germ of a smooth function @xmath7 on a smooth manifold can be deformed to a nearby function with morse singularities . moreover , morse singularities are of a simple combinatorial form enumerated by their morse index @xmath8 .",
    "their interaction is organized by the morse - witten complex , yielding a combinatorial model for the cohomology of @xmath9 . on the other hand",
    ", we construct a non - characteristic deformation of any legendrian singularity @xmath3 to a legendrian with arboreal singularities",
    ". moreover , arboreal singularities are of a simple combinatorial form enumerated by trees , in the sense of nonempty finite acyclic graphs . what results is a description of microlocal sheaves along @xmath3 in terms of modules over trees .",
    "we do not attempt to formulate here the sense in which arboreal singularities are the stable legendrian singularities , but we expect the analogy to extend in this direction .    in the statement of the theorem , we use the phrase non - characteristic deformation to mean that the dg category of microlocal sheaves is invariant under the deformation .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this is not true for many deformations that otherwise look completely reasonable ( see example  [ ex non - char ] below ) .",
    "but one can see geometrically when to expect a deformation to be non - characteristic . for any choice of reeb vector field and resulting reeb flow @xmath10 for the ambient contact manifold",

    "a deformation @xmath14 , with parameter @xmath15 , of the legendrian singularity @xmath16 will be non - characteristic if it admits a small @xmath11 so that the reeb flow displaces @xmath17 in other words , there will be no positive reeb trajectories from @xmath14 to itself of length less than  @xmath13 for all parameters @xmath15 .",

    "now let us briefly give some idea of the algorithm that deforms any legendrian singularity to a legendrian with arboreal singularities . recall that by darboux s theorem every cooriented contact manifold @xmath4 is locally equivalent to the cosphere bundle @xmath20 of a smooth base manifold  @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , any reasonable legendrian @xmath35 ( for example , from an analytic - geometric category such as subanalytic sets ) is locally equivalent to one whose wavefront projection is a finite map ( see for example the arguments of  @xcite ) .",
    "its image will be a singular hypersurface @xmath36 equipped with distinguished codirections recovering the legendrian .",
    "the starting point of our constructions will be such a hypersurface as detailed in sect .",
    "[ s dir ] .    from here , rather than try to explain the somewhat complicated inductive pattern of the algorithm in general ,",
    "let us focus the current discussion in the introduction on the form it takes for one - dimensional legendrian singularities . as topological spaces ,",
    "one - dimensional legendrians are of course nothing more than graphs , and it is not difficult to understand their deformations . but let us use this case to give a hint about what works in general .",
    "first , take @xmath18 with coordinates @xmath19 , and @xmath20 its ecosphere bundle . as recalled above in general , any one - dimensional legendrian singularity is equivalent to that of a legendrian @xmath37 whose wavefront projection is finite with image a singular plane curve @xmath38 as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : init front proj ] .",
    "we may assume @xmath39 passes through the origin @xmath40 , is smooth away from @xmath41 , so that @xmath3 defines a coorientation of @xmath42 , and the fiber at the origin @xmath43 is the single codirection  @xmath23 . with this setup ,",
    "the wavefront projection from the legendrian @xmath37 to the curve @xmath38 is a homeomorphism .",
    "( a significant complication in higher dimensions is the fact that it is only possible to arrange for the wavefront projection to be a finite map . )    next , consider the circle @xmath44 of a small radius @xmath45 around the origin @xmath46 .",
    "let us assume @xmath47 is transverse to @xmath39 , for all radii @xmath48 .",
    "for a very small constant @xmath49 , introduce the closed subarc of the circle @xmath50 consider the closed ball @xmath51 of radius @xmath52 around the origin @xmath46 , and form a new curve given by the union @xmath53 as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : new curve ] .    observe that @xmath54 is smooth away from the finitely many points of the intersection @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , away from these points , it has a canonical coorientation given by @xmath3 along @xmath56 , and by the outward radial differential @xmath57 along @xmath58 .",
    "working locally near each of the points of @xmath55 , we can smooth @xmath59 to a new homeomorphic curve @xmath60 , as pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : smoothed new curve ] , that has an unambiguous coorientation defined everywhere .",
    "thus there is a corresponding legendrian @xmath61 with homeomorphic wavefront projection to @xmath62 .",
    "finally , the singularities of @xmath63 , and hence those of @xmath64 , are of two combinatorial types .",
    "first , in a neighborhood of the points of the intersection @xmath55 , the singularities are trivalent nodes . with the exception of smooth points , these are the simplest example of arboreal singularities . in a neighborhood of the boundary ends of the subarc @xmath65",
    "we find univalent nodes .",
    "these are the simplest example of degenerate arboreal singularities , a modest combinatorial elaboration of arboreal singularities ( see sect .",
    "[ s arb ] below for a detailed exposition ) .",
    "one might hope to only find trivalent nodes and not univalent nodes , but if the original legendrian @xmath37 , and hence curve @xmath66 , itself had a univalent node , it would be awkward to try to deform it away rather than accept it as a reasonable singularity .",
    "we use the phrase non - characteristic expansion to refer to the general algorithm that formalizes the above constructions .",
    "the term expansion reflects the idea that we perform a kind of  spherical real blowup \" to expand complicated singularities into irreducible components which then interact in a combinatorial way .",
    "one could compare this with resolutions of singularities in algebraic geometry where complicated singularities become divisors with normal crossings . as discussed above ,",
    "the term non - characteristic reflects the fact that the dg category of microlocal sheaves along the legendrian is invariant under the above constructions . proving this is the most technically involved part of the paper .",
    "here is a brief summary of the specific contents of the sections of the paper .",
    "[ s prelim ] summarizes standard material from singularity theory , in particular whitney stratifications and their control data which provide the language for our geometric constructions .",
    "[ s dir ] summarizes the basic structure of wavefront projections in the form of directed hypersurfaces and positive coray bundles .",
    "[ s arb ] reviews the notion of arboreal singularities from  @xcite , then extends their exposition to generalized arboreal singularities .",
    "[ s exp ] contains our main geometric constructions : it presents the expansion algorithm that takes a legendrian singularity to a legendrian with arboreal singularities .",
    "[ s inv ] contains our main technical arguments : it proves that the expansion algorithm is non - characteristic in the sense that the dg category of microlocal sheaves is invariant under it .",
    "finally , a brief appendix summarizes the data that goes into the expansion algorithm , in particular the hierarchy of the chosen constants .    before concluding the introduction",
    ", we should mention that the constructions of this paper can be extended in various natural ways .",
    "we have tried here to choose a level of generality that best illuminates the core ideas , though it does not explicitly reach many possible applications .",
    "first , one can adapt the expansion algorithm to be strongly local in the sense that the resulting legendrian with arboreal singularities is close to the original legendrian singularity in a broad range of possible topologies .",
    "second , one can extend the expansion algorithm from local legendrian singularities to global legendrians , though at the price of possibly introducing new singularities to provide extra flexibility .",
    "but we should add that if one is interested in microlocal sheaves in a global setting , as opposed to the concrete geometry of legendrians , the results of this paper evidently glue together to give a combinatorial model .",
    "third , one can formalize the expansion algorithm so that the total space of the deformation is a legendrian of one dimension greater .",
    "going further , one can iteratively organize the expansion algorithm into a contractible simplicial set of deformations . what results is the potential to unambiguously work exclusively with legendrians with arboreal singularities for many questions .",
