    "it is known that two atoms separated by a large distance do not interact directly with each other .",
    "nonetheless , it would be highly desirable to _ engineer _ a direct interaction between two such atoms . to create such an interaction",
    ", one can try to artificially set up a continuous exchange of real photons between the atoms in a situation when virtual photons are not interchanged . here , we propose such a scheme .",
    "we show how to generate an effective interaction between atoms trapped in distant cavities connected by optical fibers . this could be useful in generating entanglement between the distant atoms .",
    "entanglement shared between distant sites is a valuable resource for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "hence , we shall calculate the amount of entanglement generated between the distant atoms by our engineered interaction .",
    "testing this entanglement will be equivalent to testing the presence of a direct interaction between the distant atoms . on a smaller scale ,",
    "when the cavities are near , the scheme would simply serve as an experiment to demonstrate the principle that atoms trapped in distinct cavities can be made to directly interact .",
    "numerous proposals have been made for entangling atoms trapped in distinct cavities @xcite .",
    "such atomic entanglement would be necessary to test bell s inequalities and quantum communication protocols with well separated massive particles .",
    "in many cases an intermediate quantum information carrier ( such as a photon ) between the atoms is involved .",
    "quantum information is mapped from atoms to photons in one cavity and mapped back from photons to atoms in another . in this paper",
    ", we eliminate the optical fields in the problem altogether to obtain an effective _ direct _ interaction between the distant atoms .",
    "this is , of course , much stronger than merely generating entanglement .",
    "for example , a direct interaction , when combined with local operations , can also be used to operate a quantum gate directly between the distant atoms , to swap the states of the atoms and so on .",
    "an ising interaction , as generated between the atoms in our case , can in fact , be used to construct a universal quantum gate between the atoms ( see the online implementation associated with ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus one can use our method to directly link atomic qubits of distant quantum processors .     and",
    "@xmath0 each containing a two - level atom are connected via optical fibers .",
    "practically the output of each cavity enters the input of the other .",
    "cavity @xmath1 also has an input off - resonant driving field @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 represent resonant laser fields for local operations.,width=144 ]",
    "we consider a very simple model consisting of two atoms , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , placed in distant cavities and interacting with light fields in a dispersive way .",
    "the two cavities are then connected by optical fibers as depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "interaction of atoms with light field in the dispersive regime can be accounted for by the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 represent the relevant intracavity radiation modes belonging cavity @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the pauli operators associated to the atomic internal degree of freedom .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath12 ( assumed , for the sake of simplicity , equal for the two atoms ) is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the dipole coupling and @xmath15 the detuning from the internal transition @xcite .",
    "suppose , for the moment , that there is no connection between the two cavities , and consider only the driving field of amplitude @xmath2 at the first cavity .",
    "then , the dynamics of the intracavity modes is described by the langevin equations @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 represent vacuum input noise and @xmath19 is the cavity decay rate ( assumed equal for the two cavities ) @xcite . for the moment",
    "we have ignored the spontaneous decay from the excited to the ground state of each atom .",
    "we will later present a case with feasible parameters in which this is possible .",
    "if we now connect the output of the cavity @xmath1 with the input of cavity @xmath0 , and the output of cavity @xmath0 with the input of cavity @xmath1 ( as in fig.1 ) , we will have additional dynamical terms of the type @xcite @xmath20 where the subscript @xmath21 indicates the field outgoing a cavity , while the prime sign means the retardation effect due to the propagation of the field along the fiber , i.e. , for a generic operator @xmath22 it is @xmath23 with @xmath24 the delay time .",
    "however , such effect can be described as the introduction of a phase factor @xcite .",
    "thus , adding the terms ( [ eqs : add ] ) to eqs.([eqs : dyn ] ) and taking into account the usual boundary conditions @xmath25 @xcite , we get    @xmath26    where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the phase introduced along the connection between the cavity @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) and the cavity @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) . such phases can be experimentally controlled . for the moment we ignore the loss effect in the fibers ( _ i.e. _ assume lossless fibers ) .",
    "later we will analyze the case for a lossy fiber linking the cavities .",
    "since we are interested on quantum effects at stationary regime , we are going to linearize our equations .",
    "first , let us write the steady state of the radiation fields by assuming @xmath19 , @xmath29 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath30 ) and the expectation values of the vacuum fields @xmath31 to be much smaller than the driving and cavity fields .",
    "it results    [ eqs : steady ] @xmath32}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\beta&=&\\gamma\\alpha\\exp\\left(i\\phi_{21}\\right)/ ( \\gamma+i\\delta)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the limit @xmath33 and @xmath34 can not be taken , since due to the recycling effect the intracavity fields in such a case would explode .",
    "then , the linearized version of eqs.([eqs : tot ] ) will be    @xmath35    where we have used the replacement @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from eqs.([eqs : totlin ] ) and ( [ eqs : totlin1 ] ) , we can adiabatically eliminate the radiation fields to obtain expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in terms of linear combinations of the pauli operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in doing",
    "so we can also neglect the noise terms for latexmath:[$ 1 < < \\gamma/\\chi < <    @xmath39 ( and hence @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) in the hamiltonian of eq.([eq : hint ] ) , leads to an effective interaction hamiltonian for the two atoms of the type @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where we have assumed @xmath45 in deriving the above hamiltonian ( [ eq : heff ] ) we have neglected the self interaction terms since @xmath46 ^ 2=1 $ ] .",
    "there are also additional local terms in the hamiltonian such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian @xmath49 is an _ ising hamiltonian _ whose spin - spin coupling @xmath50 scales as radiation pressure and goes to zero for @xmath51 and @xmath34 .",
    "we have thus managed to generate an effective ising interaction between two distant two - level atoms with the upper and lower energy levels ( say @xmath52 and @xmath53 with @xmath11 ) taking the place of up and down spins of the original ising model .",
    "this interaction strength can be arbitrarily increased by increasing the strength of radiation in the cavities .",
    "this concludes the first part of our paper , we next proceed to investigate an application of this interaction to entangling the distant atoms .",
    "gunlycke _ et al . _",
    "have recently investigated thermal entanglement in the ising model in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown in ref.@xcite that to get entanglement in the ising model , it is necessary to have a magnetic field perpendicular to the @xmath54 direction . to this end",
    ", we apply local laser fields to each atom ( l1 and l2 of fig.[fig1 ] ) such that the local hamiltonian @xmath55 given by @xmath56 acts on the atoms in addition to @xmath49 .",
    "it is also assumed that the local terms of the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath57 and @xmath48 ) are fully cancelled by choosing an appropriate detuning of the local laser fields from the @xmath58 transition .",
    "we choose @xmath59 , with @xmath60 so that the earlier derivation of the effective ising hamiltonian is unaffected by the presence of these extra classical laser fields .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system is @xmath61    the hamiltonian @xmath62 has the following eigenvectors :    @xmath63    with eigenvalues @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "let us now consider as initial state of the two atoms the ground state @xmath68 , then we can expand it over the eigenstates basis as @xmath69 with    @xmath70    the evolution of the state ( [ psi0 ] ) under @xmath62 will give @xmath71 where we have introduced the scaled time @xmath72 .    in fig.[fig2",
    "] we have plotted the entanglement of formation @xmath73 ( from the formula by wootters @xcite ) for the state ( [ psit ] ) as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "we note that @xmath73 can approach the maximum value @xmath1 before diminishes .",
    "its behavior is quasiperiodic as we are considering hamiltonian dynamics with incommensurable frequencies .",
    "as soon as @xmath73 reaches a value @xmath74 we can suppose to turn off @xmath55 ( or @xmath62 ) and leave the atoms in a maximally entangled states .",
    "notice , from eq.([psit ] ) , that entanglement does not directly depend on the interaction strength , but rather on the ratio @xmath75 . as a consequence @xmath76 determines the value of time for which the maximal entanglement ( @xmath77 ) is reached . setting @xmath78 as the smaller value of @xmath24 such that @xmath79 , the inset of fig.[fig2 ] shows how @xmath78 increases by diminishing the value of @xmath76 .     of entanglement between the distant atoms versus the scaled time @xmath24 for @xmath80 .",
    "the inset shows , on a @xmath81 scale , the time @xmath78 versus @xmath76 .",
    ", width=336 ]",
    "we have completely _ eliminated _ the optical field in the process of deriving the effective hamiltonian . in doing that we have also neglected the losses along the fibers .",
    "we now examine what happens if the fiber is lossy .",
    "the important effect of a lossy fiber is that the primed fields @xmath82 and @xmath83 also have a damping term ( say @xmath84 ) in addition to the phase factor @xmath85 relative to their unprimed counterparts .",
    "hence we should be able to model the effect of a lossy fiber phenomenologically by replacing @xmath85 and @xmath86 by @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively in eqs.([eqs : tot ] ) to ( [ eq : heff ] ) .",
    "when this replacement is done , only the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath89 and of @xmath39 on @xmath90 is affected ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 still depend in the same way on the local terms ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath91 is the found , in general , to be quite complicated ( depends on the explicit values of @xmath92 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , if we make the simplifying assumption that @xmath93 , then @xmath50 is simply replaced by @xmath94 . in the typical optical fibers used today ,",
    "the loss rates are as low as @xmath95 db per kilometer ( this data is from a quantum communication experiment with photons @xcite ) .",
    "this translates to @xmath96 for a fiber of one kilometer ( separating cavities by the same distance ) .",
    "then the coupling strength @xmath50 between the atoms is about @xmath97 percent of that estimated by eq.([eq : heff ] ) .",
    "finally , once generated , entanglement may have a stability problem due to the atomic decay from the excited states .",
    "however , one can deal this problem by using , as @xmath98 and @xmath99 , zeeman ground state levels in a @xmath100 configuration @xcite .",
    "this guarantees long lived states and its use has been already proposed within quantum computation @xcite . a recent experiment with atoms in optical cavities has used precisely this type of atomic system @xcite and we will estimate the feasibility of our proposal by slightly modifying the parameters of that experiment . the strength @xmath12 of our scheme is given in terms of two single photon rabi frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath101 and an atomic detuning @xmath102 ( different from our cavity detuning @xmath15 ) of ref.@xcite as @xmath103 .",
    "the parameters of the experiment of ref.@xcite are @xmath104 mhz .",
    "we increase @xmath19 five times , which is easy to do ( higher cavity decay rate ) and choose @xmath105 and @xmath106 for simplifying the expression of @xmath50 ( these are not necessary )",
    ". then we have @xmath107  mhz ( where @xmath108 is the number of photons in the first cavity ) .",
    "thus with @xmath109 , we already have @xmath110mhz , which is indeed a strength of interaction comparable to usual atom - light interaction strength in cavities .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a scheme for generating an ising interaction between distant atoms .",
    "such a scheme has greater potential than any scheme that merely entangles the distant atoms .",
    "for example , a direct interaction can be used to implement a two qubit logic gate between the distant atoms .",
    "the strength of the coupling can be made arbitrary by pumping more or less radiation into any of the cavities .",
    "this is a result of using off - resonant coupling , between each atom and its cavity mode .",
    "the coupling of light with any general macroscopic object , called  ponderomotive \" coupling ( see refs.@xcite for its applications in the context of entanglement ) is of the _ same _ type .",
    "thus our entangling scheme could potentially be extended to generate thermal entanglement for macroscopic objects @xcite ."
