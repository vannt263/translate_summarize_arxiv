    ", the authors proved the polynomial stability of a star - shaped network of strings when a feedback is applied at the common node and in @xcite and @xcite the authors proved a similar result for a tree of strings when the feedback is applied at an external node .",

    "some results of polynomial stability have proved before , for coupled string - beam systems @xcite ( see @xcite for general setting ) and for chains of alternated beams and strings @xcite , when feedbacks are applied at inner nodes .",
    "the case of a @xmath50 coupled system of a wave equation and a plate equation has been studied by k. ammari and s. nicaise in @xcite .",

    "precisely @xmath60 is exponentially stable if there is no beam following a string from the root to leaves and polynomially stable if not .",
    "moreover , we give an example corresponding to the last case which is not exponentially stable .",
    "the method that we use to show exponential or polynomial stability is based on the resolvent approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we reformulate the system @xmath0 as an evolution equation in a hilbert space , and prove that it is associated with a @xmath61-semigroup of contraction and in section [ sec3 ] , by using frequency domain method , we first prove , under some conditions , that the system @xmath0 is exponentially stable , then we give a result of polynomial stability .",
    "the aim of this section is to rewrite the system @xmath0 as an evolution equation in an appropriate hilbert space .",

    "let us consider @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65    note that we can rewrite the last two equations in one , as follows @xmath66    define the energy space of @xmath0 by @xmath67 endowed by the inner product @xmath68 where",

    "finally , the lack of exponential stability is proved on an example .",
    "we will use the following two results .",
    "the first gives us a necessary and sufficient condition for the exponential stability of a @xmath61-semigroup of contraction , for the proof see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
