    "the term  hydraulic jump \" refers to the sudden jump in fluid height , as for example observed in the outward spreading water layer in a kitchen sink , resulting from the impact of the water from the tap with the horizontal bottom of the sink @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena are seen in rivers with large tidal variation at the outlet and are known as  river bores \" .",
    "river bores move up the rivers , whereas hydraulic jumps are stationary , either due to spatial inhomogeneities or to the geometric configuration of the flow . in the kitchen sink ,",
    "the jump occurs on a more or less circular locus .",
    "close to the point of impact the water level is very thin , but at a certain radius , @xmath1 , the level increases abruptly forming a circular jump . the water flow and thus the jump shape in a kitchen sink fluctuate , but by building a more symmetric experimental setup and/or using a more viscous fluid , one may obtain a completely stationary and axisymmetric flow , where the jump occurs on a surprisingly well - defined circle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : circularjump ] ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that circular hydraulic jumps can undergo a sequence of structural changes seen by varying the fluid height @xmath2 downstream of the jump .",
    "this can be achieved by inserting an adjustable circular weir at the rim of the circular impact plate .",
    "when increasing @xmath2 , the jump becomes steeper until , at a critical value of @xmath2 , the jump becomes unstable and loses its balance . like a breaking wave",
    ", it creates a new stationary state with a wider jump region and a new flow structure in which the surface flow is reversed due to a separation vortex ( referred to in the following as the `` roller '' ) . following @xcite , his new flow structure",
    "is called a _ type ii jump _ to distinguish it from the `` ordinary '' _ type i jump_. the most remarkable observation about the type ii state is that the jump typically loses its azimuthal symmetry and attains the shape of a regular , though not necessarily straight - edged , polygon ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polyjump ] ) .            in this paper , we present a phenomenological model for the type ii jump , which we believe to include the basic mechanisms of the flow rendering the circular state unstable and giving the polygonal jump its peculiar shape .",
    "this allows us to obtain the qualitative dependence of the jump shape on the control parameters available , primarily the outer fluid height @xmath2 , and the properties of the fluid , i.e. , viscosity and surface tension . for experimental data ,",
    "we refer to earlier work .",
    "our own experiments are performed with the same setup as in @xcite and is only used qualitatively as a visual guide ( see also supplementary movies  @xcite ) .    for the type i state",
    ", averaging theory with a variable profile gives at least qualitatively the right flow structure including the separation region on the bottom , outside the jump @xcite .",
    "for the type ii state with separation at the surface , no such theory exists , and we therefore from the outset assume a flow structure derived from experiments .",
    "our model extends earlier models proposed in @xcite , based on the competition between gravitational and viscous effects . in @xcite a radial force balance for the roller was used together with a  line tension \" to derive polygonal shapes . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that such a line tension is not necessary and that a more satisfactory model is obtained by taking into account the azimuthal flow .",
    "this is the approach used in the present paper .",
    "it was recently pointed out @xcite , however , that the instability forming the polygonal jumps seems to be driven , at least in part , by surface tension ( see also supplementary materials  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , surface tension is included in our model and indeed the instability forming the polygonal jumps seems to be closely related to the rayleigh - plateau instability for the  liquid cylinder \" formed by the roller .    in this paper",
    ", we treat both linear and nonlinear properties of our model . for the linear properties , we can with some confidence include the effects of surface tension , but for the fully developed polygonal states , this is very difficult because of the lack of precise data on the height profiles . even without surface tension , our model does have polygonal states , and we compute their shapes assuming that they will be only slightly changed by surface tension effects .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : we first derive the model and point out the similarities and differences to earlier models .",
    "we then solve a nonlinear model with zero surface tension analytically and show that it has many features that are expected from experiments .",
    "finally , we compute the temporal stability of the circular state while including surface tension , and show that it has properties close to the rayleigh - plateau instability .",
    "in the experiment @xcite , the fluid falls from a nozzle mounted at some height , at constant volumetric flow rate , @xmath3 .",
    "we employ cylindrical coordinates , @xmath4 , centered at the point , where the central axis of the cylindrical liquid jet impinges the horizontal plate .",
    "the height of the fluid surface above the plate is parametrized by @xmath5 . as the fluid leaves the point of impact , @xmath6 is small and the fluid spreads in a very thin layer ( around 1 mm in our experiments ) with supercritical flow speed ( i.e.  a speed larger than the speed of surface waves ) . at a short distance from the point of impact ,",
    "the boundary layer in the film has become fully developed @xcite and the fluid height is almost constant , i.e. , @xmath7 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : heightprofile ] . due to the supercriticality",
    ", this inner flow is not affected by the transition from type i to type ii jump , and the flow remains axially symmetric .",
    "the surface height of the type ii jump abruptly increases at the jump radius @xmath8 due to the presence of the roller on top of the thin fluid layer .",
    "the surface height increases for @xmath9 until a certain radius @xmath10 where it settles at a roughly constant level , @xmath11 .",
    "the height difference across the jump is @xmath12 , and since @xmath13 , we use the approximation @xmath14 throughout the paper .",
    "we further introduce the _ aspect ratio _ @xmath15 which is typically small , say of the order of 0.2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rollerflowvisual ] we show a visualization of the flow in a triangular jump created with ethylene glycol .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the roller fills the jump region from @xmath8 to @xmath10 , where @xmath8 now has lost its azimuthal symmetry , whereas the outer edge @xmath10 remains circular .",
    "we therefore define the normalized local roller width as one of the basic variables of our model @xmath16 which varies with @xmath17 to give the jump its characteristic polygon shapes .",
    "the dye dripped into the roller reveals an extremely slow exchange of the fluid in the roller ( see also flow visualization in the supplementary material  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the dye can be visible in the roller for several minutes if it is left undisturbed . from this",
    "we conclude that the main part of the fluid in the thin layer going under the roller leaves the jump region without ever entering the roller .",
    "downstream of the jump region , the flow speed is subcritical ( less than the speed of surface waves ) , and the flow is again purely radial , but it now has an azimuthal dependence : at the corners of the polygon , strong radial jets are observed . within the jump region ,",
    "an azimuthal transport must therefore exist in the jump region from the sides to the corners of the polygon .",
    "indeed a small , spiraling azimuthal flow is observed in the roller from its  belly \" out to the `` neck '' . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rollerflowvisual ] the jets seem to consist primarily of liquid going right through the jump , but they also carry with them the dyed fluid transported to the corners inside the roller .",
    "the jets at the corners of an @xmath18-gon are actually so strong that they apparently break up the roller into @xmath18 distinct rollers , touching and interacting in a rather complicated manner in the corners @xcite .",
    "this effect is not included in our model , but since it occurs only in narrow regions near the corners , we believe that our model can still give useful results .     and",
    "the outer height @xmath2 are varied .",
    "the height of the nozzle about the surface is set to 2 cm .",
    "the number of corners is found to be less sensitive to the nozzle height @xcite .",
    "polygonal states with the number of corners @xmath19 are found in this experiment . [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    a phase diagram has been presented in @xcite in terms of three parameters : the flow rate @xmath3 , the outer fluid height @xmath20 and the height of the nozzle .",
    "the dependence on the first two parameters is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "when increasing @xmath2 , the transition to the type ii structure leads to a polygon with many corners ( up to @xmath21 have been observed ) .",
    "increasing @xmath2 further , the number of corners decreases and so does the average jump radius , @xmath22 , until at last the jump closes on the vertical jet from the nozzle . throughout this regime",
    "the  outer ",
    "radius @xmath10 is surprisingly constant , while the inner border defining the polygon changes .",
    "in fact , this polygon shape shows considerable hysteresis , and a whole series of bordering polygon shapes can be stable at the same flow rates .",
    "an extra corner can be created by pulling out a polygon side with a needle , and similarly , a corner can be removed by pushing a corner inward . for sufficiently small disturbances",
    "the jump simply deforms - just as if a rubber band was pulled - and bounces back to its original shape after being released .      in our phenomenological model ,",
    "we focus on the roller which we consider as a separate object interacting with the fluid beneath and behind it .",
    "we look at a control volume defined by the section of the roller inside an infinitesimal wedge @xmath23 $ ] , as illustrated in fig .",

    "let further @xmath27 be the stress tensor , let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the volume and the boundary , respectively , of the roller slice , and let @xmath30 be the unit normal of @xmath29 .",
    "then the momentum equations are @xmath31 initially , we shall consider stationary states and thus the first term on the left hand side is zero . also , the last term on the right vanishes , since the only body force is gravity , which is taken into account by assuming that the pressure @xmath32 is hydrostatic .    the inner flow in fig .  [ fig : jumpanatomy ] is purely radial and axially symmetric .",
    "when it reaches the roller , most of it passes underneath it .",
    "when it has passed the roller the flow is still radial , but has acquired an angular dependence . in between , in the region of the roller , the flow thus acquires a small tangential component , which we assume to run inside the roller .",
    "our first task is then to write down the continuity equation for the flow .",
    "then we shall evaluate the  force \" terms in ( [ eq : momentumbalance ] ) for the radial and tangential directions , respectively . in the following , we use cylindrical coordinates and denote the respective vector components of dependent variables by indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : massconserv ] ( a ) shows the top view of the entire roller , and fig .",
    "[ fig : massconserv ] ( b ) displays an angular section @xmath35 of the roller , together with the mass flux entering and leaving the control volume ( corresponding to the gray shaded volume in fig .",
    "[ fig : jumpanatomy ] ) . since the flow before the jump is purely radial and independent of @xmath17 , as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : heightprofile ] , the radial flow into the volume must be @xmath36 .",
    "the fluid going out of the volume in the radial direction is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the fluid going into the roller at the cross sectional wall at @xmath17 is @xmath38 , and the corresponding flow out of the roller at @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",

    "thus , the total pressure inside the fluid becomes @xmath115 to use these expressions we need information about @xmath5 , in the circular state and in the polygonal state  and in the family of states between them .",
    "of course , we do not have this information , so , in keeping with our simple model , which expresses the geometry of the jump entirely in terms of the local width of the roller , we shall replace the two radii of curvature with averages over the cross - section of the surface .",

    "the other one , @xmath114 , is defined in a plane orthogonal to @xmath113 , also including the surface normal . since surface inclinations are small , @xmath114 can be approximated by the radius of curvature of the jump shape seen from above ( cf . fig .",

    "since it is observed that addition of surfactant destroys the polygons ( see also supplemental material  @xcite ) , it seems likely that surface tension can make the circular states unstable through a rayleigh - plateau - like instability ( however , it can not explain the observation of circular type - ii states that are sometimes stable . ) .",
    "this means that the curvature should increase when @xmath78 is decreased as it does near a corner .",

    "<S> we propose a phenomenological model for the polygonal hydraulic jumps discovered by ellegaard _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ , based on the known flow structure for the type ii hydraulic jumps with a `` roller '' ( separation eddy ) near the free surface in the jump region . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of mass conservation and radial force balance between hydrostatic pressure and viscous stresses on the roller surface . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we consider the azimuthal force balance , primarily between pressure and viscosity , but also including non - hydrostatic pressure contributions from surface tension in light of recent observations by bush _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. the model can be analyzed by linearization around the circular state , resulting in a parameter relationship for nearly circular polygonal states . </S>",
    "<S> a truncated , but fully nonlinear version of the model can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> this simpler model gives rise to polygonal shapes that are very similar to those observed in experiments , even though surface tension is neglected , and the condition for the existence of a polygon with n corners depends only on a single dimensionless number @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we include time - dependent terms in the model and study linear stability of the circular state . </S>",
    "<S> instability occurs for sufficiently small bond number and the most unstable wave length is expected to be roughly proportional to the width of the roller as in the rayleigh - plateau instability .    _ _ </S>"
