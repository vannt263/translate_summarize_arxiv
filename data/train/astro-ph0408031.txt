    "the grism acs program for extragalactic science ( grapes ) project is a slitless spectroscopic survey that exploits the potential of the g800l grism on the hubble space telescope s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) to achieve the most sensitive unbiased spectroscopy yet .",
    "grapes is targeted in the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ) region , to complement the udf direct images , which are in turn the deepest optical imaging to date ( beckwith et al .",
    "2004 ) . the grapes survey , and in particular our data analysis methods , are described in more detail by pirzkal et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "one of the primary scientific goals of grapes is to study the luminosity function of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) using spectroscopically confirmed samples at unprecedented sensitivity , and thereby to constrain the faint end luminosity function slope .",
    "we have begun this effort through a targeted look at photometrically selected lyman break candidates , using both @xmath5-dropout galaxies from the udf ( malhotra et al 2004 ) and @xmath6-dropout galaxies which we have identified ( rhoads et al .",
    "2004 ) following the selection criteria outlined by giavalisco et al .",

    "2004a ) and the udf .",
    "( we refer to acs and nicmos filters by names of roughly corresponding ground - based filters : f435w @xmath7 b ; f606w @xmath7 v ; f775w @xmath7 i ; f850lp @xmath7 z ; f110w @xmath7 j ; and f160w @xmath7 h. ) most of the confirmed lyman break objects are spatially compact , with sizes ( @xmath8 ) and morphologies typical for the lbg population ( e.g. , ferguson et al . 2004 ) . in this _ letter _ , we describe the most prominent exception to this pattern we have encountered to date , a @xmath6-dropout object ( designated 3683 ) that is exceptional in its size , morphology , and spectroscopic properties .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the current concordance cosmology ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; see spergel et al .",
    "magnitudes are given on the ab magnitude system , so that magnitude zero corresponds to a flux density @xmath12 .",
    "we present the observations in section  [ obssec ] , compare them to various physical models for 3683  in section  [ models ] , and summarize our conclusions in section  [ theend ] .",
    "3683  has two morphological components ( see fig .",
    "[ figcol ] ) : a compact `` core , '' which is barely resolved in the acs data ( with full width at half maximum @xmath13 in the udf z filter image , which has a point spread function [ psf ] with fwhm @xmath14 ) and an extended `` plume '' with a size @xmath15 .",
    "there are three distinct condensations or `` knots '' within the plume .",
    "the optical and near - ir colors of the object ( discussed below ) identify it as a lyman break object , with an intrinsically blue spectrum suppressed by the intergalactic medium at v band and bluer wavelengths .",
    "the size is unusual relative to @xmath16 lyman break galaxies selected photometrically from the goods data ( ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ) , which show a broad peak between 0.1  and 0.5  ( comparable to the minor axis size of 3683 ) and no galaxies as large as 1  ( the major axis size of 3683 ) .",
    "3683  itself is not in the ferguson et al .",
    "sample , being slightly fainter than their flux limit .",
    "the 2d acs grism spectra of 3683  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2d ] .",
    "they detect 3683  significantly in each of the five epochs analyzed ( see pirzkal et al .",
    "2004 , and see also riess et al .",
    "2004 for more detail on epoch  0 ) .",
    "our strategy of using many roll angles results in a clean separation of the core and plume spectra for epochs 02 ( @xmath17 , 126@xmath18 , and 134@xmath18 , where `` @xmath19 '' refers to the position angle of the hubble space telescope s v3 axis ) , while the spectra from the two components are superposed in epochs 3 and 4 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the spectrum from the northwestern tip of the plume is contaminated by the spectrum of an unrelated , brighter object in the @xmath22 data , but otherwise the 3683  spectra are free of significant overlap .    where the plume s spectrum can be examined independently of other sources , including the core ( i.e. epochs 0 , 1 , and in part 2 ) , it is dominated by a single strong emission line at @xmath23 . because this line falls in the @xmath5 filter bandpass , and the plume is detected in both @xmath5 and @xmath24 images , we know that there must also be weak continuum emission from the plume on the red side of the line .",
    "the core shows both a break and a line at the same wavelength . when both core and plume component spectra are superposed ( epochs 34 ) , their combined line and continuum flux results in a stronger spectroscopic detection .",
    "we identify the line and break with , based on their wavelength coincidence in the spectrum of the core and based on the @xmath25-band nondetection and very weak @xmath6-band flux of the source .",
    "this then implies a redshift @xmath26 , with an estimated uncertainty @xmath27 .",
    "the object is near the upper end of the redshift range for v dropouts ( and approaches the redshift range of i dropouts ) .",
    "we measured the broadband optical magnitudes of the core and plume components using the udf images .",
    "we defined apertures to match the morphology of the core and plume components .",
    "these apertures follow isophotes in a version of the udf i band image smoothed with a @xmath28 fwhm gaussian kernel , except at the boundary between the two components .",
    "there is no deep minimum in surface brightness separating the core from the plume .",
    "we find for the core @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , while for the plume we obtain @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "comparing our @xmath5-band flux with the flux in the udf catalog from stsci , we find that the masks contain about 55% of the overall flux of the source , with the remaining flux in lower surface brightness regions that we did not use for our color measurements",
    ". we did not attempt to measure the colors of the knots within the plume individually , but inspection of figure  1 shows that they are consistent with the overall colors of the plume . comparing the colors of the main components",
    ", we see that the core is slightly redder in @xmath35 and considerably bluer in @xmath36 , but that the significance of both statements is low : about @xmath37 for @xmath35 and @xmath38 for @xmath36 .",
    "( note , we calculated the significance of the @xmath36 color difference directly from flux ratios rather than magnitudes . ) the @xmath36 colors are consistent with transmission through the  forest of photons emitted at @xmath39 . for a flat ( @xmath40 )",
    "continuum , we would expect the  forest to attenuate the v band flux by a factor of 14 for a source at redshift @xmath41 , based on the formalism of madau ( 1995 ) .    to eliminate any possibility that 3683  is",
    "simply a faint , intrinsically red galaxy at a lower redshift , we also examined the near - infrared colors of the object , using nicmos images of the udf ( pi r. thompson ) .",
    "we find a blue color ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "the nicmos measurements were performed using an elliptical aperture large enough to encompass the entire object ( size @xmath44 ) .",
    "we did not attempt separate ir measurements of core and plume colors , given the larger pixel size , point spread function size , and lower sensitivity of the udf nicmos data .",
    "the observed nir colors support the identification of 3683  as a lyman break object with an intrinsically blue spectrum truncated below  by the intergalactic medium .    because 3683  is both faint and extended , it is near the practical detection limit of the grapes data .",
    "we therefore combine the udf imaging data , the nicmos udf observations , and the grapes redshift to estimate the line flux and equivalent width by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "we model the intrinsic spectrum as a power law continuum plus an unresolved  emission line , modifying both by the  forest transmission calculated under the model by madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath46 colors are unaffected by  emission and  forest absorption , so we use them to constrain the intrinsic spectral slope to @xmath47 , where @xmath48 . with",
    "the slope fixed , the @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors are determined by the line flux and the redshift ( which determines how strongly  forest absorption affects broad band fluxes ) . for @xmath49 , we find a rest frame equivalent width of @xmath50  and an observed line flux of @xmath51 .",
    "the range in line flux and equivalent width is primarily determined by the range of acceptable redshifts .",
    "changing the continuum slope within its plausible range has a rather smaller effect on the line flux needed to match the @xmath35 color .",
    "the observed line flux corresponds to an approximate surface brightness of @xmath52 .    to test whether the  emission in 3683  could be powered by an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , we examined the udf direct images from multiple epochs for variability .",
    "we stacked the udf @xmath5- and @xmath24-band data into eight epochs of approximately equal exposure time .",
    "we also stacked archival @xmath24-band imaging from hst program 9352 , which is shallower than 1/8 of the udf data but gives a longer time baseline ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "subtracting the mean of the udf stacks from each individual epoch shows no significant residuals at the location of 3683 , leading us to conclude that the source is not significantly variable in the udf data , with an upper limit to flux variations of @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , at @xmath0 , any civ line lies beyond the wavelength coverage of the grism ( as do all redder agn lines ) , while the nv line is not separable from the  line at the resolution of the grism .",
    "3683  is not detected in x - rays , based on the 1.0 msec chandra deep field south catalog ( giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al 2003 ) , though given its high redshift , this does not strongly exclude an agn : only one agn at @xmath55 has been discovered in the two chandra deep fields so far ( barger et al .",
    "2002 ) , and an x - ray detection would only be expected for a rest frame hard - band luminosity @xmath56 .",
    "higher resolution optical spectra of 3683  could convincingly determine whether or not it harbors an agn by measuring the velocity width of the  emission .",
    "what is the nature of the  plume in 3683 ?",
    "the line luminosity and the equivalent width are both broadly similar to those seen in narrowband - selected samples ( e.g. , rhoads et al .",
    "2000 , malhotra & rhoads 2002 , ouchi et al .",
    "2003 , hu et al .",
    "the morphology is reminiscent of radio galaxies ( e.g. windhorst et al .",
    "1998 ) , quasar jets , the ``  blobs '' that have been observed at @xmath57 ( e.g. , steidel et al . 2000 ) , and some other high redshift galaxies ( pascarelle et al 1996 , bunker et al . 2000 , keel et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we can consider several possibilities : a recombination nebula powered by _ in situ _ star formation , possibly triggered by a galactic merger ; light from the core component scattered by either electrons or dust ; or a a recombination nebula powered by the core .",
    "[ [ insitu ] ] _ in situ _ star formation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    star formation would provide a local source of ionizing photons within the plume .",
    "it also produces lower - energy photons that would dominate the rest - uv continuum redward of .",
    "the resulting continuum slope is the bluest among the models considered here .",
    "the rest frame  equivalent width for star formation should be @xmath58  based on stellar population models at solar metallicity ( charlot & fall 1993 ) . while observations of  galaxies at @xmath59 often show larger values ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) , the presence of stars _ in situ _ will always reduce the equivalent width relative to recombination models where the ionizing photon source is distant . star formation is consistent with essentially any morphology .",
    "a conversion factor of @xmath60 is widely used for high redshift  emission , and would imply star formation at @xmath61 in the plume , subject to the standard ( but untested ) assumptions that the star formation follows a kennicutt ( 1983 ) initial mass function ( imf ) and that case  b recombination is valid .",
    "if we base our estimate instead on the rest frame uv continuum emission at @xmath62 , as measured by the z band image , we find a star formation rate of @xmath63 for the plume ( plus another @xmath64 in the core , assuming the core light is not dominated by an active nucleus ) .",
    "the conversion factors for both continuum and line light are substantially uncertain , due to assumptions about the imf and about the effects of gas and dust on  radiative transfer .",
    "thus , this constitutes remarkably good agreement .",
    "[ [ scattered - light ] ] scattered light : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if uv radiation from the core encounters a sufficiently dense scattering medium , a detectable scattering cone could be produced .",
    "this is the least plausible explanation for the 3683  plume , because the core luminosity would have to be very large to power electron scattering , while dust scattering would be unlikely to produce a large  equivalent width and a blue continuum color .",
    "we estimate the mass of scattering material required under the approximation that the plume is a cone with length @xmath65 and base diameter @xmath66 . the corresponding volume ( in physical , not comoving , units )",
    "is @xmath67 .",
    "we estimate the mass for a scattering optical depth @xmath68 from the core to the end of the cone",
    ". then for electron scattering ( with @xmath69 ) we find a number density of @xmath70 and a corresponding mass of @xmath71 in the cone .",
    "this gas would emit copious  radiation . indeed , to avoid producing more than the observed  luminosity would require that @xmath72 .",
    "clumping of the scattering gas would be required to reproduce the observed knots and the @xmath73 bend in the plume .",
    "this clumping would further enhance recombinations and further reduce the maximum @xmath68 for electron scattering to dominate the plume emission .",
    "such low optical depths imply that electron scattering is a very inefficient way of producing the  nebulosity , because scattered light will be suppressed by a factor @xmath68 .",
    "the scattering region must then be illuminated at a much higher intensity than one would navely infer from the observed core flux . consider a simple toy model where the central source has two emission components , one with a @xmath74 opening angle that powers the observed plume , and one isotropic that powers the observed core and that we allow to be attenuated by optical depth @xmath75 of absorption . to reproduce the observed plume to core flux ratio , the collimated component would then need to contain a fraction @xmath76 $ ] , which becomes @xmath77 in the limit where @xmath78 .",
    "this would correspond to a total source uv luminosity @xmath79 ( measured in the @xmath24-band , which is @xmath80 ) i.e. , @xmath81 or an angle - averaged absolute ab magnitude of @xmath82 .",
    "this luminosity would increase if either the assumed @xmath68 or degree of collimation were reduced .",
    "such a model would likely require an agn in the core , because star light can not be tightly collimated , which would increase the luminosity requirement by another factor of @xmath83 while requiring also @xmath84 on the line of sight to the core .",
    "the mass of ionized hydrogen required in an electron scattering scenario would be modest , @xmath85 .",
    "dust scattering in an ionized medium could work , as long as the optical depth is suitably small so that ( a ) there is no significant reddening of the scattered continuum light , and ( b ) ly - a radiation is not selectively absorbed relatively to the continuum .",
    "condition ( a ) requires @xmath86 at @xmath87 , and similarly condition ( b ) requires @xmath88 at @xmath89  to avoid attenuation of  by more than a factor of 2 ( panagia and ranieri 1973a , b ) .",
    "the associated total mass of gas and dust would be @xmath90 assuming a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath91 .",
    "inserting @xmath92 gives @xmath93 .",
    "the requirement on the core luminosity can be derived exactly as for the electron scattering case , but now with larger scattering opacity , so the final constraint becomes @xmath94 .",
    "an additional concern with scattering models is that the intensity of scattered light should decrease away from the agn ( falling off as @xmath95 in the simplest case , though projection effects and anisotropic quasar emission could modify this ) . yet",
    "the surface brightness of the plume is constant to within factors of two over a factor of @xmath96 in distance from the core , which would require the column density to increase with distance as @xmath97 .",
    "[ [ recombination - powered - by - core - light ] ] recombination powered by core light : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    objects like ``  blobs '' ( e.g. , steidel et al . 2000 ) and some radio galaxies have extensive  nebulae ( up to @xmath98 in size ) that are likely powered by agn emission .",
    "we now consider whether 3683  could be a physically similar object on a smaller scale .",
    "such a model is similar to the electron scattering model but with higher densities , where recombinations become more important than electron scattering . in this case",
    "the mass of ionized hydrogen involved would be @xmath99 .",
    "the core luminosity could be much lower in this case : for an ionization bounded nebula , it need only be about twice the measured  luminosity , i.e. , @xmath100 in ionizing radiation , although it could be much larger if the radiation is largely isotropic and the morphology of the plume is set by where there is substantial gas .",
    "however , in this case , the continuum emission from the plume would be pure nebular emission , with components from the two - photon process , bound - free emission , and free - free emission .",
    "the expected equivalent width of the line would then be @xmath101  ( rest frame ) and the z band continuum should be much weaker than we see . while dust attenuation of the  might help , the model would have to be fairly contrived to simultaneously fit the  flux , continuum flux , equivalent width , and color in the plume , and we therefore disfavor this model also .",
    "the only countervailing argument comes from the v band flux , which should be absent in a two - photon continuum and is indeed rather weaker in the plume than the core .",
    "however none of the v band detections are strong , so it is not clear if the difference in @xmath36 and @xmath102 colors between the two components is significant .    [",
    "[ a - merger - scenario ] ] a merger scenario : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    consider now the possibility that 3683  is a major merger in progress at @xmath103 .",
    "the nuclei of the two interacting galaxies would then presumably be the `` core '' component we have discussed plus the brightest `` knot '' in the plume , which lies @xmath104 away .",
    "quantitative morphological tests based on the asymmetry parameter @xmath105 ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2003 ) are consistent with this scenario , based on an analysis of grapes object morphologies now in progress ( pirzkal et al .",
    "if we measure asymmetry relative to the center of light for 3683  ( i.e. , almost half way from the core to the end of the plume ) , we find @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the @xmath24 and @xmath5 filters .",
    "if we instead measure @xmath105 with the center placed in the core component , we get much higher numbers , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "mergers are typically found to have @xmath110 ( conselice et al .",
    "further discussion of these parameters for the full @xmath5- and @xmath6-drop grapes samples will be presented in pirzkal et al ( 2004b ) .",
    "the projected separation of the core and knot , @xmath111 , would then imply a crossing time of order @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the relative velocity of the two components in units of @xmath114 .",
    "multiplying this by the star formation rates inferred in section  [ insitu ] implies formation of some few @xmath115 of stars in the course of the interaction .",
    "the star formation rate per unit area , based conservatively on the uv - derived sfr for the plume , is @xmath116 . comparing to the global schmidt law for star formation",
    ", we would infer a gas mass surface density of @xmath117 , for a total gas mass of order @xmath118 .",
    "this number implies a gas consumption time scale of @xmath119 , though if star formation is proceeding at an atypically high rate ( driven by interaction ) , the gas reservoir could be smaller .",
    "we have examined several possible scenarios for the observed properties of the galaxy 3683 , a very faint and high redshift object with a core - plume morphology and prominent  emission .",
    "we conclude that the  emission is most likely powered by _ in situ _ star formation throughout the object .",
    "present evidence neither requires nor rules out the presence of an agn in the core component .",
    "followup spectroscopy using higher spectral resolution and/or coverage into the near infrared would provide new information that could settle the agn question .",
    "tidally triggered star formation in a merging galaxy pair seems to describe the galaxy well . as such , it may be a particularly spectacular example of the broad class of star - forming lyman break galaxies that dominate the galaxy population observed in the hubble ultra deep field and other very sensitive , high redshift galaxy surveys .",
