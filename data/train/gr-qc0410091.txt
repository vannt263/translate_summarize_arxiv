    "the well - known regular bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solutions @xcite and the corresponding non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite , are asymptotically flat , static spherically symmetric solutions of su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory .",
    "they are unstable solutions , sphalerons @xcite , and are characterized by the number of nodes of the gauge field . besides the bm solutions there are also asymptotically flat , static , only axially symmetric regular and black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "these are characterized by two integers , the node number of their gauge field function(s ) , and the winding number with respect to the azimuthal angle , denoted @xmath2 .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions have winding number @xmath5 , while the axially symmetric solutions have winding number @xmath6 .    in su(2 )",
    "einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) theory , with a triplet higgs field , gravitating monopole solutions arise @xcite .",
    "while gravitating monopoles with unit magnetic charge are spherically symmetric , the known gravitating multimonopoles possess axial symmetry @xcite . as in eym theory ,",
    "these eymh solutions are characterized by two integers , the node number of the gauge field and the azimuthal winding number @xmath2 , which corresponds to the topological charge of the monopoles .",
    "but eymh theory allows for further static axially symmetric solutions , representing gravitating monopole - antimonopole pair , chain and vortex solutions @xcite .",
    "these solutions can be characterized by the azimuthal winding number @xmath2 , and by a second integer @xmath7 , related to the polar angle . for the monopole - antimonopole chains , which in flat space arise for @xmath5 and 2",
    ", the integer @xmath7 corresponds to the number of nodes of the higgs field ( and thus the number of poles on the symmetry axis ) @xcite . in vortex solutions , on the other hand , which in flat space arise for winding number @xmath8 ,",
    "the higgs field vanishes ( for even @xmath7 ) on @xmath9 rings centered around the symmetry axis @xcite .",
    "the existence of monopole - antimonopole pair , chain and vortex solutions in eymh theory @xcite immediately leads to the question , whether there might be analogous solutions in eym theory , even though there would be no higgs field participating in the subtle interplay of attraction and repulsion . in this letter",
    "we report the existence of one such new type of solution , related to vortex solutions in eymh theory .    in section",
    "ii we present the eym action , the axially symmetric ansatz and the boundary conditions . in section iii",
    "we discuss the properties of the new axially symmetric solutions , and we present our conclusions in section iv .",
    "we consider the su(2 ) eym action @xmath10 with ricci scalar @xmath11 , field strength tensor @xmath12   \\ , \\label{fmn}\\ ] ] gauge potential @xmath13 , and gravitational and yang - mills coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath16 leads to the einstein equations , variation with respect to the gauge potential @xmath17 to the gauge field equations .    in isotropic coordinates the static axially symmetric metric reads @xcite @xmath18 where the metric functions @xmath19 , @xmath7 and @xmath20 are functions of the coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , only .",
    "the @xmath23-axis ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) represents the symmetry axis .",
    "regularity on the @xmath23-axis requires @xmath26 there .    for the gauge field",
    "we employ the ansatz @xcite @xmath27 \\ . \\label{gf1}\\ ] ] here the symbols @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the dot products of the cartesian vector of pauli matrices , @xmath31 , with the spatial unit vectors @xmath32 respectively .",
    "the gauge field functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 , depend on the coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , only . for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 the bm solutions @xcite are recovered , while for @xmath3 , @xmath6 , one obtains the axially symmetric solutions of @xcite .",
    "the new solutions reported here are obtained for @xmath4 .",
    "they are related to eymh solutions with @xmath38 in the limit of vanishing higgs field @xcite .",
    "the ansatz is form - invariant under the abelian gauge transformation @xcite @xmath39 we fix the gauge by choosing the gauge condition @xcite @xmath40    to obtain asymptotically flat solutions which are globally regular and possess the proper symmetries , we need to impose appropriate boundary conditions @xcite . at the origin",
    "we impose the boundary conditions @xmath41 at infinity we impose @xmath42 and on the @xmath23-axis we impose @xmath43    we further introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath44 , and the dimensionless mass @xmath45 , @xmath46",
    "subject to the above boundary conditions , we solve the system of seven coupled non - linear partial differential equations numerically . to map spatial infinity to the finite value @xmath47 , we employ the radial coordinate @xcite @xmath48 the numerical calculations are based on the newton - raphson method , and are performed with help of the program fidisol @xcite .",
    "the equations are discretized on a non - equidistant grid in @xmath49 and @xmath22 .",
    "typical grids used have sizes @xmath50 , covering the integration region @xmath51 and @xmath52 . for the method , it is essential to have a good first guess , to start the iteration procedure . for the @xmath3 eym solutions ,",
    "the @xmath5 bm solutions serve as a first guess , and then the ` parameter ' @xmath2 is varied ( via unphysical noninteger values ) to obtain solutions with higher winding number @xmath2 @xcite . for the @xmath53 solutions we employ the @xmath54 eymh vortex solution with ( almost ) vanishing higgs field as a first guess @xcite , and then again vary @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath55 solutions we start from the @xmath56 eymh vortex solution .    in eymh theory , the monopole - antimonopole pair ( map ) solution is obtained , when @xmath57 , @xmath5 . here a monopole and an antimonopole are located symmetrically on the @xmath23-axis .",
    "similarly , one might try to find a sphaleron - antisphaleron pair ( sap ) solution in eym theory .",
    "the boundary conditions of such a sap solution , however , do not differ from those of a bm solution . consequently , when the eymh coupling constant @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the higgs field expectation value ) is varied , the gravitating map solution starts from the flat space solution , reaches a critical solution at a maximal value of @xmath60 , and then with decreasing @xmath60 smoothly reaches the bm solution in the limit @xmath61 ( after rescaling of the radial coordinate ) @xcite . consequently , we do not find a sap solution in eym theory , and similarly , we do not find new solutions , when @xmath57 , @xmath6 , since their boundary conditions agree with those of the axially symmetric solutions of @xcite .",
    "when @xmath62 , however , the boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) for the gauge field differ from those of the known solutions @xcite .",
    "we therefore may expect the existence of new eym solutions , subject to these boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , for instance , when @xmath60 is varied again , the gravitating eymh vortex solution starts from the flat space solution @xcite , reaches a critical solution at a maximal value of @xmath60 , and then with decreasing @xmath60 smoothly reaches a new eym solution in the limit @xmath61 ( after rescaling of the radial coordinate ) @xcite .",
    "let us in the following refer to the solutions characterized by the integers @xmath1 and @xmath2 as @xmath0 solutions . in fig .",
    "1a we exhibit the energy density of the new @xmath65 eym solution .",
    "its energy density has a pronounced maximum on the @xmath66-axis , thus the energy density is torus - like .",
    "the energy density of this @xmath65 solution is thus similar to the energy density of the ( lowest mass ) known @xmath67 eym solution @xcite , exhibited in fig .",
    "but the maximum of the @xmath65 solution is smaller than the maximum of the @xmath67 solution , and it is shifted slightly inwards .",
    "in addition , the @xmath65 solution has a small saddle point on the @xmath66-axis , located further outwards . on the other hand comparison with the corresponding eymh solution @xcite shows ,",
    "that the energy density of the eym solution differs significantly from the energy density of the flat space @xmath65 eymh solution , whose energy density exhibits two tori , located symmetrically with respect to the @xmath68-plane @xcite .",
    "the existence of a @xmath53 eym solution with winding number @xmath64 , immediately suggests that analogous solutions with winding number @xmath69 should exist as well .",
    "indeed , by increasing @xmath2 , a whole set of such new solutions is obtained numerically , one for each integer @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , a decrease of @xmath2 does not lead to new solutions .",
    "instead a bifurcation at the non - integer and thus unphysical value of @xmath70 is obtained , where a second branch of solutions with higher mass appears .",
    "consequently there is a second solution for @xmath64 , and also for each higher integer @xmath2 , but there are no such solutions for integer @xmath71 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2a , where we exhibit the mass of these @xmath72 eym solutions .",
    "only the integer values of @xmath2 in the figure correspond to physical solutions . in fig .",
    "2b we illustrate the value of the metric function @xmath19 at the origin .",
    "we note , that for @xmath73 solutions ( with a single node ) we find only one branch , which is also exhibited in figs .  2 .",
    "to illustrate the dependence of the solutions on @xmath2 , we exhibit the energy density of the @xmath72 solutions with @xmath74 on the lower ( mass ) branch in fig .",
    "3a and on the upper branch in fig .",
    "3b . with increasing @xmath2 the maximum of the energy density decreases and moves outwards for the solutions on both branches .",
    "for the same @xmath2 , the maximum of the upper mass solutions is higher and located further inwards than the maximum of the lower mass solutions .",
    "the small saddle point turns into a small maximum on the upper branch , thus the energy density of the solutions on the upper branch has a more complicated structure as seen in fig .  4 , where a surface of constant energy density is shown for the @xmath65 solution .",
    "we exhibit the gauge field function @xmath75 for the same set of solutions in figs .  5 .    for @xmath55",
    "we obtain a similar pattern of solutions .",
    "but the new type of solutions appears only for @xmath76 .",
    "the mass and the value of the metric function @xmath19 at the origin of these @xmath77 solutions are also shown in figs .",
    "the energy density for @xmath77 solutions with @xmath78 and the gauge field function @xmath75 are shown in figs .  6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "based on these results , we conjecture the existence of @xmath0 solutions with @xmath79 , but expect that they will appear only for still larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "we have constructed numerically new static regular solutions of eym theory with axial symmetry .",
    "these solutions are characterized by the integers @xmath0 , related to the azimuthal and polar angles , respectively . in particular , we have obtained solutions for @xmath53 , @xmath80 , and @xmath55 , @xmath81 .",
    "like the previously known @xmath73 solutions @xcite , the @xmath72 and @xmath77 solutions on the lower branch have a torus - like shape . on the upper branch of the @xmath77 solutions",
    "double tori appear for larger @xmath2 . the @xmath73 solutions ( with one node )",
    "most likely exist for any integer @xmath82 and form a single branch .",
    "the new @xmath72 and @xmath77 solutions have lower bounds on @xmath2 , @xmath83 , which imply the existence of two branches of solutions for both values of @xmath1 .",
    "we expect , that the @xmath72 and @xmath77 solutions represent only the first sequences of new solutions , and conjecture the existence of @xmath0 solutions also for higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath3 bm solutions are unstable @xcite , and there is all reason to believe , that the new @xmath0 solutions are also unstable .",
    "having constructed the regular axially symmetric solutions it appears straightforward to construct analogous black hole solutions , and , in particular , to look for rotating solutions @xcite .",
