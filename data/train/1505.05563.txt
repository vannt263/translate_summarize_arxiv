    "micron - sized dust grains are dragged by the gas , and when they collide they stick with one another and grow in size by forming fluffy or porous aggregates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the details are still being worked out ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , those aggregates continue to grow by collision until they become @xmath4  1  km in size ( now called planetesimals ) , at which stage gravity takes over and finally ` runaway ' growth of a few bodies leads to planet formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to study the mineralogy of circumstellar dust around young stars as it represents the original constituents of planetesimals and hence of the rocky planets like our own earth .",

    "although vla  4a and 4b exhibit similar flux densities at centimetre wavelengths , vla  4b is the dominant object ( by a factor of more than 2 ) in the millimetre range with its spectral index at these radio wavelengths most probably arising from thermal dust emission @xcite .",
    "the optical / nir source svs13 has been associated with vla  4a by these authors based on older optical data ; however , recently @xcite identified svs13 with vla  4b , this time using the newer and more ( both photometrically and astrometrically ) accurate 2mass catalogue ( also , the epoch of the 2mass observations happens to fall between the epochs of the two radio measurements that discovered and then confirmed the close binary ) .",

    "since there is only one emissive component ( a black - body ) and the rest are always absorptive , which all naturally come after the black - body , the order in which the absorptive components appear should not matter ( i.e. , they are commutative ) .",
    "we have indeed obtained exactly the same results ( minimum @xmath36 and @xmath37 values ) even when the order in the component list was altered .",
    "it is interesting to note that when the sic ( _ plus _ trapezium ) emissivity is combined with only one of the crystalline silicate species ( forsterite or enstatite ) , their best - fit parameter values are rather uncertain [ by more than 10  per  cent ; see models c ( 2-comp+cr fors ) and d ( 2-comp+cr enst ) in table  [ fit - results ] ] ; however , when all three ( sic , crystalline forsterite and enstatite , _ plus _ trapezium ) are combined , their best - fit values become significantly more certain [ by @xmath38  5  per  cent ; see model e ( 2-comp+cr fo&en ) ] .",
    "this is most probably a manifestation of the fact that it takes all three emissivities / absorption coefficients to fit well the complex spectral shape longward of @xmath510  @xmath2 m .",
    "the general trend is clearly such that the more components there are , the better the fit , as one might expect .",
    "however , it stops when both amorphous and annealed sio@xmath3 are added to the mix .",
    "were the trend to continue , one would have expected to obtain the smallest @xmath36 for the combination that involves all the dust species considered in this study .",
    "not only did @xmath36 not improve but also the contribution from amorphous sio@xmath3 became insignificant ( in addition , its best - fit @xmath37 is poorly constrained , with the associated uncertainty at nearly 30  per  cent , while all the other values show reasonable certainty at well below 10  per  cent ) . combining these findings with the fact that adding annealed sio@xmath3 alone gives a better fit than the amorphous counterpart in its place , we consider model g ( 4-comp+cr sio@xmath3 , i.e. , a black - body , amorphous silicates , sic , crystalline forsterite and enstatite , plus annealed sio@xmath3 ) the best - fit model with the fewest number of components . figure  [ best.fit ] shows the @xmath0-band spectrum of svs13 overlaid with the best - fit model ( solid line ) .",

    "however , it has been known for some time that , for laboratory measured absorption spectra of dust species , the method of preparation of dust samples is critically important .",
    "for example , hand - grinding and ball - milling will produce different results @xcite .",
    "annealing processes ( at different temperatures and for different durations ) also affect the outcome and depending on the treatment , peak positions and full - widths at half - maximum of dust features will differ , sometimes significantly ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . when these further complications are taken into account , it is even more impressive how good a fit the selected model components provided , considering the complexity of the features modelled and the limited number of dust species required . in the following discussion ,",
    "we assume that the dust components present in the best - fit model exist in the circumstellar environment of the pms star svs13 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , they are the most abundant dust species in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "the broad , smooth absorption feature arising from the si@xmath1o stretching mode , peaking at about 9.7  @xmath2 m , is the strongest and best studied infrared feature in the diffuse ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) , although identifying their specific mineralogy or composition has traditionally been extremely difficult , especially if accompanying 20-@xmath2 m data is not available .",
    "most , if not all , astronomical mineralogy studies contain amorphous silicates in one form or another ( see , for example , tab.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the amorphous silicate absorption appears prominently in the @xmath0-band spectrum of a young star .",
    "however , we do not attempt to associate it with a particular mineral , but rather use a generic representation of amorphous silicates in a star - forming region as provided by the trapezium emissivity .",
    "silicon carbide has never been observed in the diffuse ism @xcite , although it is produced in carbon star ejecta and is undoubtedly injected into it .",
    "so where does it go ?",
    "one simple explanation may be that dust grains are destroyed in the ism by , for example , supernova shock waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . if the substantial gap between the dust lifetime ( @xmath510@xmath39  yr , @xcite ; 1996 ) and the dust injection timescale ( from dust formation in the outflows of dying stars to being incorporated into new star - forming regions ; @xmath510@xmath40  yr , @xcite ; @xcite ) is valid , then sic grains may also have been destroyed , hence no 11.3-@xmath2 m sic feature detected in the ism .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , pre - solar sic grains ( and many others ) have been found ( e.g. , in a carbonaceous chondrite murray by @xcite ) so some dust grains must survive the harsh ism .    sic has in fact also been suggested as a dust component in a number of comets @xcite .",
    "good fits to the @xmath0-band spectra of three comets ( 1p / halley , c/1987 p1 bradfield , and 1986l wilson ) , which all exhibited two broad peaks centred at about 9.7 and 11.3  @xmath2m , m but it was omitted from fitting procedure @xcite . ] were obtained using a laboratory measured spectrum of synthetic amorphous olivine ( i.e. , silicate , @xcite ) and the complex refractive index of @xmath41-sic from @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the 11.3-@xmath2 m feature in comets has generally been attributed to crystalline silicates ( e.g. , for halley s comet , @xcite ) .",
    "while the available data is limited to the @xmath0-band spectrum alone , its identification unfortunately remains rather ambiguous as their signatures are often overwhelmed by that of amorphous silicates .",
    "only when measurements at other wavelengths ( especially at 20  @xmath2 m and longer ) are on hand , the crystalline silicate assignment becomes more robust ( e.g. , for comet hale - bopp using the _ iso _ sws data , @xcite ; 1997 ) .",
    "those three comets ( and hale - bopp also ) are all long - period oort cloud comets which are thought to have originated just beyond the ice giant formation region ( @xmath4  15  au , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the most conclusive evidence for the presence of pre - solar sic grains in comets came from dust samples , captured and returned to earth by nasa s stardust mission to comet 81p / wild  2 @xcite , which belongs to short - period jupiter family of comets ( jfcs ) , which are likely to have formed in the kuiper belt ( @xmath4  30  au ) .",
    "the discovered 300-nm sic grain is unique , in that it is the only pre - solar grain so far found in the silica aerogel dust collector , possibly reflecting the complex preparation required for the aerogel track analysis @xcite , and no pre - solar sic grains have yet been detected in the impact craters on the surface of exposed aluminium foils . the abundance of pre - solar sic grains in 81p / wild  2 has been estimated to be @xmath545  ppm @xcite , which is consistent with that in insoluble organic matter residues from a number of different classes of chondritic meteorites ( 10@xmath155  ppm , @xcite ) .",
    "these findings reveal that sic grains must have been available in a wide range of distances from the sun , from the carbonaceous chondrite formation region of the inner few au to the comet - forming outer reaches of the proto - solar nebula .",
    "interestingly , pre - solar sic grains found in another carbonaceous chondritic meteorite murchison , for example , showed little evidence of scarring @xcite due , for instance , to grain - grain collisions .",
    "were the interstellar environment as destructive as it has been described ( e.g. , by @xcite ) , such hallmarks should certainly be present . then again , whether a dust grain survives is probably largely statistical in nature and it is perhaps only natural that those that do show little damage . nonetheless , when @xcite re - examined the dust lifetime using revised uncertainty estimates , they found it to be comparable with the dust injection timescale .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative solution to the missing sic problem : oxidation .",
    "they argued that the ejected sic grains could be selectively destroyed by surface oxidation in the o - rich interstellar environment .",
    "indeed , partial oxide layers on some pristine pre - solar sic grains from the murchison meteorite have been reported @xcite . in volatilisation experiments of sic grains under solar nebula - like",
    "oxidising conditions @xcite , either continuous or partial sio@xmath3 layers are formed , depending on oxygen fugacities ( continuous at higher and partial at lower fugacities , or more and less oxidising , respectively ) . similarly , though probably unintentionally , an oxide layer had grown on the surface of sic nano - particles after they were taken out of a vacuum chamber @xcite . however , even though a sio@xmath3 layer does add new features due to the presence of the mantle material , it does not appear to suppress very much the 11.3-@xmath2 m sic feature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in a similar study to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "identified coatings mainly consisting of carbonaceous material on the surface of some pristine pre - solar sic grains also from murchison .",
    "furthermore , once again from the same meteorite , some graphite spherules were found to contain sic grains ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such sic - containing graphites have also been found in samples from another meteorite , orgueil ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the discoveries of these sic - containing graphites are quite significant as they are clear evidence that pre - solar sic grains either formed earlier than or at about the same time as the graphites .",
    "one spherule in particular ( only one of a kind so far ) , discovered by @xcite , houses a sic grain at its centre , most probably indicating the central sic acted as a nucleation core ( i.e. , sic may have been formed first ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the number of sic inclusions hitherto found is rather limited ; only about a dozen graphite spherules that contain sic grains have been reported ( see references listed above ) , whilst graphites with internal carbides ( predominantly tic , @xcite ) number @xmath580 to date , despite the fact that the abundance of ti is very much lower than that of si .",
    "these results ( the scarcity of sic - containing graphites and much more numerous tic inclusions ) can be explained by a relative condensation sequence of solids in carbon star outflows ; in conditions typically found for carbon stars , the condensation sequence is thought to be tic , graphite , and then sic @xcite .",
    "there have however been some suggestions that , under certain circumstances , sic is formed before graphite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in fact , condensation in this order ( sic before graphite ) has been invoked to account for the lack of the 11.3-@xmath2 m sic feature in the diffuse ism ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . as sic grains formed in the vicinity of carbon - rich stars travel further away and become cooler , a carbon layer develops on the grains and hides the sic feature .",
    "such scenario was in fact briefly mentioned by @xcite , and unlike the oxide coating discussed earlier , the carbon mantle seems to suppress successfully the 11.3-@xmath2 m signature ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a short letter has been published in a surface science journal that reports the dissolution of the amorphous carbon layer into the sic core , when the core - mantle grain was heated to 600@xmath42c ( 873.15  k ) under high vacuum ( @xmath43  torr , @xcite ) . at 800@xmath42c ( 1,073.15  k ) , the surface layer completely disappeared without altering the lattice structure of the particle .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , they have further observed that when the sic grain was cooled back to room temperature , still under high vacuum and thus without any significant contaminants , the amorphous carbon coating re - emerged ( i.e. , the process is reversible , @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature reached in their experiment ( 1,073.15  k ) is above the glass transition temperature of amorphous analogues of enstatite ( mgso@xmath27 ) composition ( 1,040  k , @xcite ) . as crystalline dust species ( crystalline forsterite and enstatite , and annealed sio@xmath3 ; see  [ cry.sil ] & [ ann.sio2 ] ) are also present , temperatures reached in the circumstellar environment of svs13 must have been high enough to produce those and remove the carbon coating from the sic grains . under presumably much more severe conditions encountered ,",
    "the amorphous carbon layer could still be absent from the sic core even at sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath44  100  k at @xmath4  15  au , @xcite ) for the grains to exhibit the sic absorption feature .",
    "recall that @xcite concluded that sic grains are most likely to be included in an amorphous silicate matrix ( see also  [ pol.sec ] ) .    to our knowledge , it has never been established whether the re - heated sic particles would exhibit ( in absorption ) exactly the same feature as that seen towards carbon stars . in any event ,",
    "it is known to vary somewhat from one carbon star to another ; so much so that , @xcite have coined a term ` @xmath511-@xmath2 m feature ' ( i.e. , with the approximation mark ` @xmath5 ' and fewer significant figures ) to emphasise its variability . also , a self - absorbed sic band has been detected towards extreme carbon stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , where amorphous carbon might be expected to dominate .",
    "therefore , although this scenario ( resurgence of the sic feature in a warm environment ) may plausibly explain the situation in svs13 , it should be treated with caution",
    ".    however , we highlight the fact here that if we take out the sic component from the best - fit model ( @xmath45 = a black - body , amorphous silicates , crystalline forsterite and enstatite ) , became rather insignificant or even negative ( i.e. , turned emissive ) .",
    "we have therefore decided to exclude it from the fitting procedure in this test case .",
    "the inference drawn in this section would still be valid regardless of the crystalline sio@xmath3 inclusion . ] the resulting fitting @xmath36 value ( 14.7 ) is better than that for the most basic model a ( 1-comp = a black - body plus amorphous silicates ; 30.0 ) but worse even than the one for the simple model b ( 2-comp = a black - body , amorphous silicates , and sic ; 10.5 ) , signifying need for the sic inclusion . see figure  [ bf - sic ] which compares models  b and i. it is clear , apparent in the residual plot in the lower panel , that the fit for model  i becomes much worse than that for model  b longward of @xmath510  @xmath2 m , especially around 11.3  @xmath2 m , where the contribution from the sic emissivity is significant .",

    "also , that the total flux density spectrum is obviously dominated by absorption does not necessarily imply the polarisation profile would also be indicative of absorption .",
    "instances can occur where the polarisation is dominated by emission but the conventional flux density shows deep absorption , an effect first predicted by @xcite and seen in a few sources ( e.g. , ngc7538  irs1 and rcw57  irs1 in @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately in the case of svs13 there is additional polarisation data in the nir , up to almost 3.5  @xmath2 m , which can be compared with the mir ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most specifically the measured polarisation position angles in the two spectral regions are almost identical at @xmath5@xmath46  degrees . the nir polarisation is almost certainly due to dichroic absorption since it rises through the 3-@xmath2 m water - ice band",
    ". there can be no polarised emission through this band because the ice would obviously melt at the 500@xmath11,000-k temperatures characteristic of nir emission ( and it is unclear if relevant grain alignment mechanisms could operate at such a high temperature ) .",
    "thus , given the equality of the position angles , it is very likely that the mir polarisation is also due to dichroic absorption .",
    "having established the polarisation process as dichroic absorption it remains to determine what type of dust can produce such a unique 8@xmath113-@xmath2 m profile , and especially a peak beyond 11  @xmath2 m .",
    "possible candidate carriers with bands around 11  @xmath2 m and longer , inferred in other astronomical spectra and/or found within pre - solar meteoritic grains , include crystalline silicates and sic , as shown in figure  [ all - comp ] , as well as water ice , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , aluminium oxides and carbonates .",
    "polarisation models have been run for all of these potential constituents , either as inclusions mixed in with an amorphous silicate host matrix or as a confocal mantle coating an amorphous silicate core .",
    "details of the modelling will be presented elsewhere ( wright et al .  in preparation ) , but are based on the rayleigh approximation for spheroidal particles . at mir wavelengths , according to @xcite , this is adequate for grain radii ( of an equivalent volume sphere ) up to at least 0.5  @xmath2 m , where the relative difference between exact and rayleigh solutions is less than 10  per  cent for the water ice coated grains of their work .",
    "relevant formulae for the absorption and polarisation cross sections of both bare and mantled spheroids are given in @xcite and @xcite , whilst those for an ` average ' dielectric function of a mixture , using effective medium theory such as the maxwell - garnett rule , are provided in @xcite .",
    "in all cases we have used an oblate core with principal axis ratio of 2 , parameters which are reasonably constrained from other observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the amorphous silicate optical constants are those of ` astronomical silicate ' , first formulated by @xcite , and subsequently updated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mir component of these optical data sets was constructed to reproduce the spectrum of trapezium , so our choice is consistent with the emissivity function we used to model the conventional ( total flux density ) spectrum in  [ model ] .    as might be expected based on the absorption coefficients shown in figure  [ all - comp ] , polarisation features of crystalline silicates , such as inclusions of the crystalline olivine of @xcite ,",
    "are simply too narrow to match the observed svs13 polarisation spectrum .",
    "they instead produce a spectrum which looks much like the polarisation profile of the massive embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) afgl2591",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) and iras13481@xmath16124 @xcite , two sources with a sharp polarisation feature at @xmath511.2  @xmath2 m superposed on the much broader amorphous silicate band .",
    "similar comments hold for pahs and carbonates . whilst its resonance is relatively broad",
    ", aluminium oxide inclusions merely produce a shoulder , or long - wavelength wing , on the amorphous silicate polarisation profile @xcite .",
    "the long - sought but rarely identified 12-@xmath2 m librational band of water ice , occurring between @xmath512 and 13  @xmath2 m for the crystalline and amorphous phases respectively @xcite , may be thought to be a strong candidate .",
    "svs13 does have the characteristic 3.1-@xmath2 m h@xmath3o ice absorption band , which @xcite note is more like that from crystalline than amorphous ice .",
    "its optical depth however is not particularly high , only around 0.55 .",
    "this compares to values of around 1 to 3.5 in a sample of embedded ysos in @xcite .",
    "their study included another source with an unusual 8@xmath113-@xmath2 m spectrum , namely the eastern component of the double source afgl961 , with a 3.1-@xmath2 m optical depth of 2.46 .",
    "indeed , the only previous identification of the librational band was made for afgl961 , firstly by @xcite using _ iras _ and then by @xcite for each component using _",
    "spitzer_. this has recently been questioned by @xcite on the basis of radiative transfer models suggesting the 8@xmath113-@xmath2 m silicate feature could be self - absorbed , leading to a local minimum between the 10- and 20-@xmath2 m silicate bands occurring around 13  @xmath2 m and thus mimicking ice absorption . however , their models only do an average job of reproducing the overall shape of the observed 2@xmath120-@xmath2 m spectrum and profile of the 8@xmath113-@xmath2 m feature . also , they only modelled afgl961e and not afgl961w , which has a prominent silicate emission feature but still shows the same apparent absorption at 13  @xmath2 m ( as well as co@xmath3 ice absorption at 15  @xmath2 m ) . whatever the case , as presented in @xcite , there is sufficient evidence that the librational band has been detected toward at least a few ysos ( although none look much like svs13 itself ) .",
    "thus , polarisation models with water ice either as a mantle or as inclusions were attempted . ice existing as a mantle on silicate cores is the ` standard ' model for dust in molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the idea behind ice as inclusions is that if silicate grains are initially porous or fluffy , then within a cold molecular cloud ( or disc ) water ice may condense to fill the pores .",
    "alternatively , ice - mantled grains may collide and stick together , resulting in a similar type of grain structure .",
    "whatever the case , core - mantle grains can not produce the position of the polarisation peak in svs13 .",
    "see figure  [ svs13-pol - fig1 ] , which shows in ( b ) and ( d ) models using a mantle of respectively amorphous and crystalline water ice ( optical constants from @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the mantle - to - core volume ratio is 0.5 , but in fact mantles do not sufficiently change the overall polarisation profile even up to mantle - to - core volume ratios of 4 or more .",
    "the 10.3-@xmath2 m peak of bare amorphous silicates is still clear , and indeed sharper and higher than the water ice peak around 12  @xmath2 m , whilst the observed svs13 peak lies in the trough between them .    on the other hand , as seen in figure  [ svs13-pol - fig1 ]  ( a ) and ( c ) , a silicate - ice mixture can reasonably match at least the overall shape and peak position of the svs13 polarisation spectrum for an ice - to - silicate volume ratio of 0.375 .",
    "a serious flaw however is that it predicts large polarisation in the 3-@xmath2 m water ice band , e.g. , an excess of @xmath56@xmath18  per  cent over the continuum compared to an observed value of @xmath38  1.5  per  cent described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this assumes that grains are small enough that the rayleigh approximation remains valid at 3  @xmath2 m , reasonable for grain sizes @xmath38  0.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "see tab.2 in @xcite , where the relative difference between exact and rayleigh solutions only increases to 10@xmath115  per  cent at 3  @xmath2 m for either oblate or prolate grains with an ` equivalent volume ' spherical radius of 0.5  @xmath2 m .    included in each panel of figure  [ svs13-pol - fig1 ] is an inset showing the optical depth extracted from the ucls spectrum of svs13 as presented in @xcite , compared to the absorption cross section of the respective models .",
    "the optical depth was calculated by fitting a planck function between the short and long wavelength ends of the spectrum , after correcting them for a grey component of emissivity taken to be the trapezium emissivities at 7.5 and 13.5  @xmath2 m .",
    "the inferred colour temperature is around 350  k , not too dissimilar to the model - based temperatures listed in table  [ fit - results ] . in no case",
    "does water ice , either as a mantle or as inclusions , match the optical depth profile .",
    "we therefore conclude that water ice is highly unlikely to be responsible for the unique svs13 mir spectrum , unless its optical properties are much different to those used here ( which are extremely similar to those presented in many other publications ) .",
    "thus , the only remaining alternative is sic and indeed this provides the best match to the observed svs13 mir polarisation spectrum",
    ". see figure  [ svs13-pol - fig2 ] which shows polarisation models of sic inclusions within an amorphous silicate matrix , using the maxwell - garnett mixing rule to calculate the effective dielectric function .",
    "several different dielectric functions of sic were trialed , namely : cubic ( 3c or @xmath47 ) and two samples of hexagonal ( 6h or @xmath41 ) for e both perpendicular and parallel to the c - axis , derived by @xcite from single - crystal reflectance spectroscopy ; @xmath41-sic in @xcite , also from reflectivity measurements ; an ` astronomical sic ' from @xcite derived from several different laboratory data sets ; @xmath41-sic determined from particle transmission measurements and presented by @xcite .",
    "all can provide good matches to the overall profile of the observed spectrum , with respective volume fractions of the sic inclusions of 0.1 for the pitman et al .  and choyke & palik data sets , and 0.25 for the laor & draine and pegourie optical data .",
    "whilst the models are all qualitatively similar , apart perhaps from the pegourie case , the best match appears to be for the 6h ( hexagonal ) e - ray optical data of pitman et al .",
    "( 2008 ; figure  [ svs13-pol - fig2 ]  b ) .",
    "specifically , the wavelength of peak polarisation and the profile shapes of both the polarisation and optical depth more closely follow the observations .    that the sic polarisation signature dominates over that of silicates is testament to its stronger refractive indices and band strength , i.e. , absorption cross section per unit volume .",
    "in at least the crystalline samples this is accentuated by a polarisation reversal across the strong resonance ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which essentially subtracts polarisation from the amorphous silicate at 10  @xmath2 m .    in the interests of completeness , we computed models with sic as a confocal mantle on a silicate core .",
    "these did not provide anywhere near as good a match to the observed optical depth and polarisation profiles .",
    "similarly , models using the optical data of amorphous thin films of sic from @xcite and @xcite did not match the spectra , being either too broad and/or peaking at the wrong wavelength .",
    "given their weaker refractive indices than for the crystalline phases they also necessitated a larger relative abundance of sic ( compared to silicates ) . finally , we replaced the ` astronomical silicate ' with a magnesium - iron laboratory olivine , mg@xmath48fe@xmath49sio@xmath26 , from @xcite , motivated by its good match to the diffuse ism mir polarisation profile presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this provided very similar fits to the data .    in summary ,",
    "both the conventional and polarisation spectra require the presence of a material with optical properties much like sic , inclusive of a high band strength , a central wavelength near 11.3  @xmath2 m and full width of a few microns .",
    "we thus assess the carrier of the additional absorption from approximately 10 to 12  @xmath2 m in svs13 to be sic itself . but given the variation in the optical properties of specific types of sic found in the literature a reliable estimate of its abundance is difficult .",
    "this is apart from a general statement that it is higher than in any other young star envelope or disc of which we know .",
    "the _ iso _ crystalline silicate revolution @xcite came about because the _ iso _ satellite was equipped with instruments capable of making measurements at longer wavelengths , where crystalline silicate features are not overwhelmed by those of more abundant and warmer amorphous silicates , as is usually the case in the @xmath0-band @xcite .",
    "there are three plausible mechanisms adept at producing crystalline silicates .    1",
    ".   _ evaporation and re - condensation _ under high temperature and pressure condition in the immediate vicinity of the central star ( @xmath50  1  au ) , dust grains can be evaporated and then re - condense as crystals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thermal annealing _ there have been at least three probable heat sources suggested in circumstellar discs [ accretion luminosity in the inner region ( @xmath51  au ) , @xcite ; shock heating at a few au , @xcite ; and disc surface layer annealing during accretion outburst , @xcite ] .",
    "whatever the actual heat source(s ) may be , the essence of the mechanism is simple annealing ( i.e. , heating of amorphous silicates and subsequent cooling to re - order the lattice structure ) .",
    "low - temperature crystallisation _ put forward by yamamoto and co -",
    "workers ( e.g. , @xcite ) , provided that an amorphous silicate core is coated with an organic ( carbonaceous ) refractory layer @xcite , a chemical reaction can be triggered at a low temperature ( a few hundred k ) to re - arrange the silicate lattice structure .",
    "it is interesting to note that , so far , most detections of crystalline silicate features towards young stars have been in emission ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with only one recent report of clear detection of absorption @xcite to date , a fact that may or may not favour one crystallisation mechanism over the others .",
    "inclusions of the two most abundant crystalline silicate species , forsterite ( mg@xmath3sio@xmath26 ) and enstatite ( mgsio@xmath27 ) , in absorption , substantially improve the model fitting in the current study .",
    "equilibrium calculations suitable for the inner disc regions ( @xmath51  1  au , @xcite ) show that these magnesium - rich crystalline silicates should dominate .",
    "however , the crystalline silicate features are observed in absorption here and therefore the dust grains responsible for the signatures are likely to reside in the cold , outer regions .",
    "apart from the low - temperature crystallisation described above , some means of heating is required to turn the amorphous lattice structure into crystalline , and if heating is only possible in the vicinity of the central star , an effective transport / mixing mechanism is required for crystalline silicates to be found in the remote , cooler regions .",
    "indeed , crystalline silicates appear to be concentrated in the centre of many t - tau systems , with more than 90  per  cent of the 84 objects observed by @xcite showing strong 10-@xmath2 m crystalline silicate features but only about 50  per  cent having detectable 20@xmath138-@xmath2 m signatures , most probably indicating the temperature range of the crystalline silicates ( @xmath52  k at @xmath44  a few  au , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , who , as part of the _ spitzer _ cores - to - discs legacy programme , observed 108 young stars ( 66 of which were known t - tau stars ) , identified what they termed the ` crystallinity paradox ' , wherein they found the cold crystalline features at wavelengths @xmath53  20  @xmath2 m more frequently than those at @xmath510  @xmath2 m . however , when they re - examined it by analysing a further 58 _ spitzer _ irs spectra , they found a simultaneous enhancement of crystallinity in both the inner , warm and outer , cold regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reported comparable crystalline silicate abundances in the inner and outer disc regions in a _",
    "irs study of 65 t - tau stars .",
    "although details may differ slightly , an undisputed universal outcome of all these investigations is the existence of processed ( i.e. , crystalline ) materials in the outer , cooler parts of the circumstellar environment , as well as in the warmer , inner regions in the vicinity of the central star .",
    "comets contain crystalline silicates ( e.g. , comet hale - bopp , @xcite ; 1997 ) .",
    "the most definitive confirmation was once again found in the stardust sample return from comet 81p / wild  2 , the crystalline silicate mass fraction of which was as high as @xmath50.5@xmath10.65 @xcite .",
    "the 81p / wild  2 specimens also included chondrule - like particles @xcite , a clear indication that materials that constitute the comet experienced high temperatures in the past .",
    "another clue to the apparent heating episode(s ) in the stardust samples is the presence of calcium- , aluminium - rich inclusion ( cai)-like grains @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sic.sec ] , 81p / wild  2 belongs to the short - period jfcs , which are believed to originate in the kuiper belt , extending from the orbit of neptune ( at @xmath530  au ) to approximately 50  au , in which the surface temperature of the most famous of its resident , pluto , is only @xmath540  k @xcite .    to overcome these facts at odds with each other ( existence of high - temperature phases in cold regions )",
    ", a number of mechanisms have been proposed to mix / transport radially the dust grains transformed near the central star .",
    "these include : the bipolar outflow ` x - wind ' model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , accretion disc turbulence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , spiral arms in marginally gravitationally unstable discs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and outward transport in the disc mid - plane ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "now , both chondrules and cais are sizable entities that often measure hundreds of @xmath2 m and some as large as mm ( chondrules ) or even cm ( cais ) in diameter ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although particles that large in the 81p / wild  2 capture are rare ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , analogous to chondritic meteorites that contain large chondrules and cais , a similar size distribution may also be expected to exist in their probable natal bodies such as comets @xcite .",
    "a recent modelling effort @xcite has found that particles of the size of chondrules and cais ( a few mm or larger ) can not easily be transported out to the comet - forming region , regardless of their initial location .",
    "if this is the case , an in - situ production of melted grains may have to be invoked .",
    "we will come back to this point in  [ cry.mech ] .",
    "aforementioned equilibrium calculations also show that , when the mg / si abundance ratio is @xmath51  1 ( or perhaps after a significant amount of mg has been taken up by forming forsterite ) , sio@xmath3 ( and enstatite ) becomes a major condensate @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that when they annealed enstatite ( mgsio@xmath27 ) smoke at 1,000  k for 30  hours , the end product consisted of crystalline forsterite ( mg@xmath3sio@xmath26 ) , tridymite ( crystalline sio@xmath3 ) and amorphous silica ( sio@xmath3 ) .",
    "this is a case similar to that reported by @xcite , who cooled a mixture of composition mgsio@xmath27 from the liquid state and found that , first forsterite separated out and , after further cooling , a mixture of silica and enstatite condensed .",
    "as crystalline silicates also exist , it may be deduced that some form of heating has melted mgsio@xmath27 and decomposed it into mg@xmath3sio@xmath26 and sio@xmath3 .",
    "we further speculate that , once again , taking the presence of crystalline forsterite and enstatite as evidence , the cooling rate is just so that it would allow re - ordering of lattice structures to produce annealed sio@xmath3 . or , that crystalline sio@xmath3 is dominant over its amorphous counterpart in the stages immediately after their formation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , sio@xmath3 has been identified in the mir spectra of some young stars .",
    "@xcite observed a t - tauri star hen  3 - 600a in the @xmath0-band and their best - fit model included @xmath41-quartz ( i.e. , a type of crystalline sio@xmath3 , from @xcite ) . @xcite",

    "amorphous silica @xcite and silica - rich glass @xcite emissivities were ruled out by @xcite , this time observing 5 more , different t - tau stars , but inclusion of annealed sio@xmath3 @xcite gave a better fit .",
    "a _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum of a @xmath47-pictoris analogous ( i.e. , debris - disc ) star hd172555 , which suggested the presence of amorphous silica and sio gas , was examined by @xcite .",
    "the 12.6-@xmath2 m feature that would have indicated the existence of crystalline silica was not detected .",
    "they proposed planetesimal - scale ( @xmath5km - size ) hyper - velocity ( @xmath53  10  km  s@xmath54 ) impacts as the mechanism that produced fine ( amorphous ) silica dust and sio gas .",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained a _ spitzer _",
    "irs spectrum of another debris - disc star hd15407a and concluded that incorporating an almost equal amount of fused ( i.e. , amorphous ) quartz @xcite and annealed silica @xcite provided the most satisfactory fit .",
    "they also favoured a similar scenario to that adopted by @xcite for hd172555 .",
    "although the number of samples is rather limited and most studies mentioned above did not set out specifically to probe crystalline or otherwise of silica dust structure , overall it is tempting to conclude that younger stars ( t - tauri stars , @xmath44  10  myr ) are more likely to possess more crystalline than amorphous sio@xmath3 , while with slightly more evolved sources ( debris - disc bearing stars , @xmath4  10  myr ) , the balance is tipped in the other direction .",
    "also , if hyper - velocity planetesimal impacts are indeed required for the production of amorphous silica , this alone points to the latter stages in the evolution of protoplanetary discs .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then the natural implication may be that the circumstellar environment of ( still deeply embedded and therefore much younger ) pms star svs13 should contain mostly crystalline sio@xmath3 but not much ( if at all ) of its amorphous sibling .",
    "we have demonstrated that crystalline silicates ( forsterite and enstatite ) and annealed sio@xmath3 exist in the cold , outer regions of circumstellar environment of the pms star svs13 .",
    "although we did not directly detect larger chondrules and cais in the current study , they may exist if the typical dust size distribution in chondritic meteorites also holds in the remote , cooler regions ( at least in the comet - forming region at a few tens of au from the central star ) .",
    "if that is the case , an in - situ transformation mechanism of dust grains is probably required .",
    "the runaway growth of planetesimals is the ` standard ' model for terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "outer gas giants , like jupiter and saturn , can be formed in a similar fashion via what is called the core - accretion ( ca ) model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but also feasible is if the remote , cold regions of the protoplanetary disc become gravitationally unstable and fragment , forming self - gravitating clumps , some of which will ultimately become gas giants ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    according to the latter mechanism ,",
    "commonly referred to as the disc instability ( di ) model , fragmentation can take place at @xmath4  50  au and clumps ranging from a few to @xmath510  @xmath55 ( jupiter masses ) may form ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as these massive clumps contract and",
    "migrate inwards , the internal temperature rises and it can reach @xmath4  1,000  k , sufficient to produce crystalline silicates , chondrules and cais ( and dissolving amorphous carbon coating on sic grains ) _ in  situ_. when they are tidally disrupted , these thermally altered particles may be distributed at a wide range of radii to be re - captured by , e.g. , comets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "of course , thermal processing of dust species can still occur in the immediate vicinity of the central star and the dust grains may be transported out to the comet - forming region of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "one of the plausible dust heating processes that could produce chondrules and cais ( and at the same time a possible transport / mixing mechanism ) , is the x - wind model of shu et al .",
    "( i.e. , jets near the central star ) . but",
    "this has been criticised by @xcite , who prefer shock - heating , due to di but at a few au ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . however , as mentioned in  [ cry.sil ] , it is difficult , if not impossible , to move large particles such as chondrules and cais out to the comet - forming region , wherever their initial location may have been @xcite . even if shocks can be triggered , the gas density at the distance of the kuiper belt ( @xmath4  30  au ) is such that chondrule formation by shock - heating might not be feasible .",

    "the ` clearing ' or a gap between the circumbinary and the central circumstellar discs is also a product of the tidal interactions between the binary components , as the protoplanetary discs are stripped of materials and truncated to substantially smaller sizes compared to those around single stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a compact structure at the position of vla  4b of radius @xmath530  au , clearly smaller than that often measured for discs around single stars of @xmath59  au ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . discs are not only truncated but , in such a dynamic environment , they are also rapidly dispersed within a short period of time ( @xmath60  myr ) , considerably shorter than a characteristic disc lifetime of @xmath61  myr normally expected for single stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though the effect could be slightly milder for a binary separation of @xmath570  au for svs13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this type of disruptive impact might be thought to affect the planet formation negatively , bonavita & desidera ( 2007 ; see also @xcite ) concluded that the detection frequencies of planets in single and binary systems are statistically identical .",
    "most interestingly , @xcite showed that , while binaries with separation wider than 100  au are indistinguishable from single stars in terms of trends regarding their protoplanetary discs , debris discs , and planets , close binaries in the range from 5 to 100  au exclusively host giant planets ( i.e. , those with mass @xmath62  @xmath55 ) , or exhibit a distinct lack of planets smaller than 1  @xmath55 .",
    "the two modes of planet formation discussed earlier present notably different timescales : ca with @xmath4  a few myr and di @xmath44  1  myr @xcite . considering the short lifetime of circumstellar discs in close binaries",
    ", it could be the case that di is the only effective means of forming planets in them , and if so , the finding of @xcite might just be a natural consequence of this .",
    "recent observations of the young low - mass binary system gg  tau  a @xcite have revealed that a ` streamer ' of dust and gas , originating from the circumbinary disc and feeding the inner circumstellar discs can shock - excite h@xmath3 gas at the interface , where the gas temperature was found to be in excess of 1,500  k. unlike the shock - heating of particles ( due to di ) rejected earlier because of the low density in the outer parts of the circumstellar disc , we surmise that a stream of material from the circumbinary disc piling up at the outer rim of the protoplanetary disc , combined with a higher shock velocity generated by streamers ( 20@xmath130  km  s@xmath54 for streamers vs.  @xmath50  10  km  s@xmath54 for di , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , could make this a viable mechanism for melting / annealing dust grains _ in  situ _ in the remote regions of circumstellar discs .",
    "we therefore suggest that , amongst the processes that are capable of thermally altering dust grains , an in - situ mechanism is favoured for svs13 . furthermore , the di model for giant planet formation  provided that fragmentation occurs in circumstellar discs in binary systems  along with the shock - heating mechanism detected by @xcite , is the leading candidate for producing crystalline silicates ( and chondrules & cais ) , annealing sio@xmath3 , as well as possibly dissolving the feature - concealing amorphous carbon layer from the sic core .",
    "it remains to be seen if the scenarios just presented are rare or only occur in a short - lived evolutionary phase in shaping the distinctive @xmath0-band spectrum of svs13 . to this end",
    ", we are embarking on the search for similar objects and at the same time , it is hoped that work both in the laboratories and theoretical studies will advance sufficiently in the near future to solve , for example , the missing sic problem .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectrum of the low - mass pms close binary system svs13 is presented .",
    "the unique and complex spectrum is best modelled by a mixture of amorphous silicates , crystalline forsterite , crystalline enstatite , annealed sio@xmath3 , and , most intriguingly of all , sic , which has never before been identified in the circumstellar environment of a young star .",
    "the requirement for the inclusion of silicon carbide is also affirmed from the mir polarimetry perspective .",
    "all these signatures are seen in absorption , implying the dust particles reside in remote , cold regions of the circumstellar environment .",
    "speculation is made on possible origins of the dust species , especially those that have been processed and altered thermally , namely crystalline silicates and annealed sio@xmath3 .",
    "the di - induced fragmentation and the subsequent contraction and disruption of the giant planet embryos , along with the newly discovered shock - heating mechanism at the interface between the circumbinary and circumstellar discs , may be able to modify those dust grains _ in  situ _ in the outer , cooler parts of the circumstellar environment .",
    "the heating episode(s ) provided by one or both of these processes can also feasibly reveal the hidden sic feature .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0-band ( 8@xmath113  @xmath2 m ) spectroscopic observations of the low - mass , embedded pre - main - sequence close binary system svs13 . </S>",
    "<S> absorption features are clearly detected which are attributable to amorphous silicates , crystalline forsterite , crystalline enstatite and annealed sio@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> most intriguingly , a major component of the dust in the envelope or disc around svs13 appears to be sic , required to model adequately both the total intensity and polarisation spectra . </S>",
    "<S> silicon carbide is a species previously detected only in the spectra of c - rich evolved star atmospheres , wherein it is a dust condensate . </S>",
    "<S> it has not been unambiguously identified in the interstellar medium , and never before in a molecular cloud , let alone in close proximity to a forming star . yet </S>",
    "<S> pre - solar grains of sic have been identified in meteorites , possibly suggesting an interesting parallel between svs13 and our own solar - system evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the uniqueness of the spectrum suggests that we are either catching svs13 in a short - lived evolutionary phase and/or that there is something special about svs13 itself that makes it rare amongst young stars . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the physical origin of the respective dust species and why they are all simultaneously present toward svs13 . </S>",
    "<S> two scenarios are presented : a disc - instability - induced fragmentation , with subsequent localised heating and orbital evolution firstly annealing initially amorphous silicates and then dispersing their crystalline products throughout a circumstellar disc ; and a newly discovered shock - heating mechanism at the interface between the circumstellar and circumbinary discs providing the crystallisation process . </S>",
    "<S> one or both of these mechanisms acting on carbon - rich grain material can also feasibly produce the sic signature .    </S>",
