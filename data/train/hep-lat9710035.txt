    "the discovery of the new perovskite superconductors @xcite opened the path to critical temperatures ( @xmath0 ) for superconductivity as high as @xmath1 k , surpassing by a factor of seven the highest known @xmath0 for metals or alloys .",
    "in fact the physical mechanism for superconductivity seems to be rather different .",
    "traditional superconductors present an _ isotope effect _ , which calls for a phonon mediated mechanism .",
    "they also have a gap ( of order of mev ) in the excitation spectrum , as shown by the exponential decrease of the specific heat at low temperature .",
    "all this can be accounted for by the bcs theory , where electrons of opposite spin and momenta are attractively coupled through a phonon exchange .",
    "the basic bcs statement is the existence of a critical temperature at which this attraction _ simultaneously _ produces the _ formation _ of bound states of pairs of electrons ( with binding energy of the order of the gap ) and the _ condensation _ of those pairs into a _ quantum liquid_.    the new superconductors show an intriguing phenomenology :    superconductivity appears in doped , ceramic materials , like la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 doped to la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath3 , starting at @xmath6 .    at @xmath7=0",
    "it is an insulating antiferromagnet .",
    "at large @xmath7 it may be a normal metal .",
    "the doping suppresses the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlation between neighboring cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "however , large ( ) in - plain correlations remain just above @xmath0 . also , transport phenomena occur mainly in the cuo@xmath2 planes , so everything looks like a d=2 problem , with localized spins on the cu and mobile holes on the o ions .",
    "again the superconductivity is charge-2 in nature ( there is a _ pairing state _ ) .",
    "anomalous _ normal _ ( _ i.e. _ non superconducting ) state : there are experimental indications of a _ pseudo - gap phase _",
    "( pair formation _ before _ quantum liquid condensation ) .",
    "all this poses some essential questions @xcite : what is the physical origin of the anomalous _ normal _ state ?",
    "how can it be characterized ? what is the mechanism for high @xmath0 superconductivity ? and what is the _ pairing state _ ?",
    "the natural ( lattice ) field - theoretical approach is effective field theory .",
    "for instance , the long wavelength , low temperature ( antiferro)magnetic excitations of the the parent compound ( undoped la@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ) are well described by the o(@xmath8 ) non - linear @xmath9-model ( nl@xmath9 m ) @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of our proposal are :    treat localized spins ( at cu ) , and charge - carriers ( at o ) independently and , both , dynamically _",
    "i.e. _   not hole moving on a _ fixed _ spin background .",
    "relativistic lattice field theory , where m.c . and",
    "mean field calculations are _",
    "feasible_.    try to catch the essential features of electrons strongly coupled to afm spin backgrounds ( _ i.e. _ not a microscopic model ) .",
    "we define a 2 + 1-dimensional o(@xmath8 ) lattice model , with two flavors of * naive * fermions : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are two - component dirac spinors in @xmath14 .",
    "the flavors _ mimic _ the two values of the electron _ spin_. the matrices @xmath15 are pauli matrices .",
    "the coupling @xmath16 will be related to the doping fraction @xmath7 . in the large-@xmath16 region ,",
    "the change of variable ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) shows that the fermionic kinetic term is suppressed by a factor @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , at both @xmath20 and @xmath21 we recover the nl@xmath9 m .",
    "the _ insulating _ undoped material should be represented by the @xmath22 limit , as suggested by the fermion hopping suppression .",
    "thus small @xmath7 corresponds to large @xmath16 ( a possible correspondence is @xmath23 , @xmath24 being a constant ) .    -1 cm    there is a technical problem for the numerical simulation , as @xmath25 are _ constrained _ variables not belonging to a _",
    "lie group_. we solve it by introducing _ three _ conjugate momenta _ per spin_. we then obtain the hamiltonian @xmath26 for which equations of motion preserving the constraint and the energy , can be written : @xmath27 the standard hmc algorithm is now straightforward .",
    "the simulation took 16 days of the 32 pentium pro processor parallel computer rtnn based in zaragoza . in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , we show the phase diagram of the model at zero temperature .",
    "notice that it is very similar to the familiar diagram of ( chiral ) yukawa models @xcite .",
    "we name their ferrimagnetic phase _ exotic magnetic _ ( em ) , to avoid confusion in a condensed matter context .",
    "so far , the undoped material could be represented by either of in fig .  [ phases ] . however , while doping the material , the representative point moves in the plane ( @xmath28,@xmath16 ) .",
    "doping suppresses the afm order , so the curve @xmath28=@xmath28(@xmath16 ) should start at ( @xmath29,@xmath21 ) . in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , the arrows sketch the possible _ trajectory _ of a material with increasing doping .    for the fermionic correlation functions , our results are still at the mean - field level .",
    "the small-@xmath16 region is in a perturbative regime , with _",
    "light fermions _ of mass @xmath30 ( a fermi liquid ) . in the large-@xmath16 region ,",
    "the fermionic kinetic term in the action is at the mf level .",
    "thus , inside the pms phase ( @xmath31 ) , the fermions are essentially non - propagating .",
    "however , the operator @xmath32 excites a spin singlet of mass @xmath33 , which can get small in the pms phase , that is a _",
    "light charge-2 spin singlet bound state _ , as in ( chiral ) yukawa models @xcite . inside the fm(s ) phase , the kinetic term is not so strongly suppressed ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , carriers are expected to propagate . in the afm(s ) phase the original fermions ( and doublers ) do not propagate . but fermions with wavenumbers @xmath35 are found to propagate ( strongly resembling the _ schrieffer pockets _ ) .    -1 cm    now , we can qualitatively discuss the behavior with the temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ tx ] , and ref .",
    "the @xmath36=0 axis can directly be read off from the arrow line in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .",
    "as we enter the pms phase , we should expect the light , charge-2 bound states to be bose - einstein condensed , yielding superconductivity .",
    "as the temperature rises , the be condensation will disappear , and the system enters a region with heavy single fermions and uncondensed light charge-2 pairs .",
    "this we expect to correspond to the _ pseudo - gap _ phase . at even higher temperatures",
    ", the pairs will break up ( yielding an insulating phase at the mf level ) .",
    "we also obtain fermi liquid behavior at large @xmath7 ( small @xmath16 ) .",
