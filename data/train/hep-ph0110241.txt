    "the nmssm @xcite ( next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ) is defined by the addition of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath0 to the mssm ( minimal supersymmetric standard model ) and a global @xmath1 symmetry on the renormalizable part of the superpotential .",
    "it allows to omit the term @xmath2 in the superpotential of the mssm ( where @xmath3 is the higgs doublet coupled to the up - type fermions and @xmath4 to the down - type ones ) and to replace it by a yukawa coupling ( plus a singlet self coupling ) , hence solving the so - called ` @xmath5 problem ' of the mssm .",
    "apart from the standard quark and lepton yukawa couplings , the superpotential of the nmssm is w = h_u h_d s + 13 s^3 + ... [ supot ] and the corresponding trilinear couplings @xmath6 and @xmath7 are added to the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms . once the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry is broken , the scalar component of @xmath0 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath8 , thus generating an effective @xmath5 term , @xmath9 .",
    "the superpotential ( [ supot ] ) is scale invariant , and the ew scale appears only through the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the possible domain wall problem due to the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry at the weak scale is assumed to be solved by adding non - renormalizable interactions which break the @xmath1 symmetry without spoiling the quantum stability with unwanted divergent singlet tadpoles @xcite .",
    "this can be done by replacing the @xmath1 symmetry by a discrete @xmath10-symmetry , broken by the soft susy breaking terms @xcite .",
    "a similar model , called nmssm ( for new minimal supersymmetric standard model ) has recently been proposed @xcite , using discrete @xmath10-symmetries to forbid the singlet self - interaction in ( [ supot ] ) . in this model , @xmath11-th order singlet tadpole graphs generate a divergent loop - suppressed term in the scalar potential , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this term breaks the dangerous peccei - quinn symmetry present when @xmath14 is set to 0 in the nmssm .",
    "the new states in both models are one additional cp - even neutral higgs @xmath15 ( real part of the complex scalar field @xmath0 ) , one cp - odd neutral higgs @xmath16 ( imaginary part ) , as well as one additional neutralino , the ` singlino ' @xmath17 .",
    "these states usually mix with the corresponding mssm states , giving three cp - even neutral ones , two cp - odd neutral higgses and five neutralinos .    in this study , we focus on the phenomenology of the neutral higgs sector of the nmssm and nmssm at the tevatron ( run ii , @xmath18 tev ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc , @xmath19 tev ) .",
    "we only consider the ` direct ' production channels , namely @xcite ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 refers to any possible quark flavour ) : [ procs ] gg   ( ) , & & q|q^( ) v    ( ) , + q q^()q q^( )    ( vv- ) , & & gg , q|qq|q    ( ) . here , we neglect ` indirect ' higgs production via decays / bremsstrahlung off heavy susy particles @xcite .",
    "in order to study the higgs spectrum of both models , we have numerically scanned their free parameter spaces using a similar program as described in refs .  @xcite .",
    "first , we constrained the soft terms of both models by requiring _ universality _ at the gut scale . the independent parameters of the models are then : a universal gaugino mass @xmath23 , a universal mass for the scalars @xmath24 , a universal trilinear coupling @xmath25 , the yukawa coupling @xmath26 and the the singlet self - coupling @xmath14 ( nmssm ) or the tadpole coefficient @xmath27 ( nmssm ) .",
    "the ( well - known ) value of the @xmath28-boson mass fixes one of these parameters with respect to the others , so that we end up with _ four _ free parameters at the gut scale , i.e. , as many as in the mssm with universal soft terms . in principle",
    ", one could choose the same set of free parameters as in the mssm , i.e. , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , @xmath26 , and @xmath14 ( @xmath27 ) being determined by the three minimisation equations .",
    "however , this appears to be not easily feasible , as @xmath26 ( @xmath14 ) also influences the running of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the soft parameters between the gut and the weak scale .",
    "therefore , we took the following input parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath26 and @xmath14 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we then integrated numerically the rges between the gut and the weak scale and minimised the two - loop effective potential .",
    "this gives @xmath34 and @xmath30 and the overall scale @xmath23 is fixed by @xmath35 .",
    "finally , we imposed the current experimental bounds on ( s)particle masses and couplings , especially the lep limits on the higgs mass vs. its coupling to gauge bosons , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assumed the existence of one neutral cp - even higgs boson with mass 115 gev and sufficient coupling to gauge bosons , as suggested by lep @xcite .",
    "the main result of this numerical analysis , as already pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that the additional couplings appearing in ( [ supot ] ) are always small : @xmath36 ( nmssm ) and @xmath37 ( nmssm ) .",
    "( higher values would lead to unphysical minima of the scalar potential . )",
    "the mixing angles of the additional singlet states ( described in sect . [ intro ] ) to the non - singlet sector , being proportional to these couplings , are always small and the singlet sector of the universal nmssm / nmssm is quasi decoupled .",
    "( in the non - universal scenario , the outcome may be quite different : see ref .",
    "hence , the neutral higgs sector consists of a quasi pure ( qp ) cp - even higgs singlet state , @xmath15 , a qp cp - odd singlet , @xmath16 , and the doublet sector is basically mssm - like , apart from small perturbations of order @xmath38 , so that results known for the higgs sector of the mssm are also valid in our case .",
    "fixing the mass of the lightest visible ( non - singlet ) cp - even higgs at 115 gev puts further constraints on the parameter space of both models : we find that @xmath39 is always larger than 4 , the cp - odd doublet higgs mass @xmath40 is larger than 160 gev and @xmath41 is larger than 350 gev . in this limit ,",
    "the cp - even doublet states are qp interaction eigenstates .",
    "the higgs state with mass 115 gev is a qp @xmath3 , and the qp @xmath4 is heavy ( with mass larger than 300 gev ) . on",
    "the other hand , the masses of the singlet higgs states , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , can vary from a few gev to 1 tev .",
    "1.25cmtotal number of @xmath15 events , @xmath42    1.25cmtotal number of @xmath43 events , @xmath44    4.0@xmath45 ( gev)6.75cm@xmath40 ( gev )    [ fig : tevatron ]    for each of the five neutral higgs bosons , we have computed the total number of events obtained by summing the rates of all production processes in ( [ procs ] ) , assuming 15 fb@xmath47 for tevatron ( run ii ) and 300 fb@xmath47 for the lhc , as integrated luminosities .",
    "we have plotted these rates versus the mass of the given higgs states in figs .",
    "[ fig : tevatron][fig : lhc ] . if , as threshold of detectability of a signal , we assume 100 events , the conclusions are similar in both models .    first , at tevatron the non - singlet cp - even higgs with mass 115 gev ,",
    "the qp @xmath3 , is of course always visible , but the other non - singlet cp - even state , the qp @xmath4 , is not , as it is too heavy .",
    "the non - singlet cp - odd state , the qp @xmath43 , will be visible if it is light enough ( @xmath48 gev for a total number of events @xmath49 ) . the singlet",
    "cp - even state , the qp @xmath15 , will also be visible up to masses of @xmath50 gev if @xmath51 ( so that this state is not too decoupled ) , particularly when it is quasi mass degenerate with the qp @xmath3 state ( notice the peaks at @xmath52 115 gev ) .",
    "on the other hand , the singlet cp - odd state , the qp @xmath16 , will remain invisible at tevatron . to render this manifest ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron ] the total number of events produced at tevatron with @xmath15 in the final state , @xmath42 ( two left plots ) in green ( light ) when the corresponding @xmath43 state is also visible ( @xmath53 ) and in red ( dark ) when it is not ( @xmath54 ) . similarly , we did for @xmath43 ( two right plots ) , with green ( light ) when the corresponding @xmath15 is visible ( @xmath55 ) and red ( dark ) when it is not ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the upper plots correspond to the nmssm and the lower ones to the nmssm . from these plots",
    "it is easy to see in which cases one , two or three higgs states will be visible ( with more than 100 produced events ) at tevatron .",
    "1.25cmtotal number of @xmath15 events , @xmath42    1.25cmtotal number of @xmath16 events , @xmath57    4.0@xmath45 ( gev)6.75@xmath58 ( gev )    [ fig : lhc ]    at lhc , on the other hand , due to the large center of mass energy available , all three non - singlet states , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath43 , will be visible . in the singlet sector",
    ", the @xmath15 should be visible if its mass is @xmath59 gev and @xmath26 is not too small . in the nmssm , this covers most of the parameter space .",
    "moreover , the cp - odd singlet , @xmath16 should be visible for an appreciable part of the parameter space , at least for the nmssm .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] , with the same lay out and colour coding as for fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron ] , but this time for @xmath15 and @xmath16 at lhc .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the discovery areas of multiple higgs boson states identified in figs .",
    "[ fig : tevatron][fig : lhc ] are indeed associated to the same regions of parameter space .",
    "however , a first glance at the total number of cp - odd non - singlet @xmath43 produced at tevatron in both models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tevatron ] , right - hand plots ) might indicate that nearly all the parameter space of the models is already covered by the cp - even singlet @xmath15 search at tevatron , as all the plotted points are in green ( light ) .",
    "this is however not the case , as one can check from the left - hand plots ( @xmath42 vs. @xmath60 at tevatron ) , where a lot of points are still under the 100 events threshold .",
    "the fact that one sees only green ( light ) points on the right - hand plots is due to the very high density of points plotted , green ( light ) points being plotted after red ( dark ) ones .",
    "hence , there are red ( dark ) areas , uncovered by the @xmath15 searches , behind green ( light ) , covered , ones .",
    "this remark applies also for associated @xmath15 , @xmath16 searches at lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc ] ) .",
    "the conclusions of this preliminary study are that , although the singlet sector of non - minimal models tends to decouple from the rest of the spectrum in the universal case , quasi pure singlet states could still be found at future hadron colliders .",
    "one has to remember that a very light cp - even higgs state is not excluded by lep searches if its coupling to gauge bosons is small enough .",
    "such a higgs state should be looked for at tevatron ( run ii ) where up to three neutral higgses could be found in our models ( the cp - even non - singlet @xmath3 with mass 115 gev , and the cp - odd non - singlet @xmath43 and cp - even singlet @xmath15 if their mass is small enough ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the large center of mass energy of lhc will allow us to see at least the three non - singlet higgses ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath43 ) and its huge luminosity will trace the cp - even singlet state up to masses of @xmath59 gev and , in some cases , the cp - odd one , making the whole neutral higgs spectrum visible .",
    "the caveat of our analysis is that we have not performed a full higgs decay analysis in the nmssm / nmssm .",
    "one may question whether the additional higgs states would actually be visible .",
    "for example , they would certainly couple to singlinos ",
    "@xmath61 is always the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) in our context  hence decay into the latter and thus remain undetected",
    ". this should however not be the case .",
    "in fact , the coupling of the singlet states to ordinary matter are generally stronger in comparison ( of order @xmath26 , whereas those to two singlinos are @xmath62 ) . so that , in the end , the main decay channels of singlet higgs states should be those into detectable fermions and gauge bosons .",
