    "the discreteness of space at the planck scale is certainly one of the most important and one of the most fascinating predictions of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been commonly accepted for a long time that the smooth differentiable structure of space - time ( inherited from general relativity ) should be modified at this fundamental scale and replaced by a new type of quantum geometry .",
    "however , lqg has been one of the first approaches ( not to say the first one ) of quantum gravity to propose a framework where such a scenario happens precisely .",
    "even if the discreteness of space has been proved only at the kinematical level so far ( where the quantum dynamics has not been taken into account ) , it has been rigorously established from the that quantum states of geometry are one - dimensional excitations which live in the so - called ashtekar - lewandowski hilbert space .",
    "the question of the quantum dynamics is still largely open and it is not obvious whether or not the discreteness remain at the physical level @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , spin - foam models , which are promising attempts towards the resolution of the dynamics ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) , seem to predict that the discreteness remains at the physical level .",
    "the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath1 @xcite plays a central role in the scenario which has lead to the discreteness of space at the planck scale .",
    "the physical importance of @xmath1 shows up directly in the expression of the area spectrum because @xmath1 enters in the formula of the area gap @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the planck length and @xmath7 . to have a deeper understanding of the significance of @xmath1",
    ", it is essential to return at the beginnings of lqg . in @xcite",
    ", ashtekar showed that complex gravity can be formulated as a gauge theory where the connection takes values in a chiral component of the complex lie algebra @xmath8 .",
    "the complex theory has to be supplemented with reality conditions to make it equivalent to classical real ( first order ) gravity .",
    "not only gravity features a lot similarities with gauge theory in the ashtekar formalism but also the constraints , emerging in the hamiltonian formulation , are simple polynomials of the fundamental variables .",
    "this last property contrasts strongly with what happens in the usual adm formulation where the constraints are highly non polynomial functionals of the phase space variables .",
    "this new formulation raised the hope to perform for the first time the canonical quantization of gravity and then to open a promising road towards quantum gravity .",
    "lqg was born .",
    "however , the fact that the gauge group is complex makes the problem of quantizing the theory too complicated and even totally unsolved up to now . technically , the main difficulty relies on the highly non linearity of the reality conditions that no ones knows how to handle at the quantum level .",
    "the barbero - immirzi parameter was introduced to circumvent this problem because it allows to reformulate gravity as a real gauge theory whose gauge group is now @xmath9 .",
    "the price to pay is that the ashtekar - barbero connection is no more a full space - time connection @xcite and the hamiltonian constraint is no more a simple polynomial functionals of the fundamental variables .",
    "therefore we loose some of the very interesting features of the original ( complex ) ashtekar formulation of gravity .",
    "nonetheless , one can start the quantization of the theory and construct at least the kinematical hilbert space from the harmonic analysis on @xmath9 .",
    "this is a deep improvement compared to the complex theory where no hilbert structure has been found so far even at the kinematical level .",
    "therefore , introducing @xmath1 allows to turn , at the kinematical level , the complex gauge group @xmath10 into the real compact gauge group @xmath9 . in that respect , the barbero - immirzi parameter ( when it is real ) is intimately linked to the fact that the gauge group is @xmath9 , and then it is directly related to the discreteness of the spectra of the geometric operators in lqg .",
    "the physical consequences of the presence of @xmath1 in lqg are manifold .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 plays a central role either in the bounce scenario of the universe in loop quantum cosmology ( see the reviews @xcite ) and in the recovering of the bekeinstein - hawking black holes entropy ( with the right famous @xmath11 factor ) at the semi - classical limit @xcite .    nonetheless , the importance of @xmath1 at the quantum level strongly contrasts with the irrelevance of the same parameter at the classical level where it disappears totally from the classical equations of motion .",
    "some arguments have been proposed to explain these discrepancies @xcite but none were totally convincing . in a recent series of paper @xcite ,",
    "we have studied with details this puzzle in the context of three dimensional gravity and black holes thermodynamics . in both cases , we arrived at the conclusion that the barbero - immirzi parameter should not play any role in lqg , and everything converges to the idea that @xmath1 should be fixed to its original value @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , we argued that working with the imaginary value @xmath12 is the only choice ( for the barbero - immirzi parameter ) which will lead to a consistent quantum theory , accompanied by a proper ( canonical or covariant ) dynamics and possessing a correct semiclassical and continuum limit .",
    "this expectation is furthermore motivated by the geometrical significance carried by the complex ( chiral or self - dual ) ashtekar connection defined for @xmath12 and is supported by remarkable additional facts @xcite . while quantizing the self - dual theory remains an immensely hard problem because of the reality conditions , one reasonable point of view is to see @xmath1 as a regulator which should be sent back to the original complex value @xmath12 at some point .",
    "this idea was shown to work exactly in the context of three dimensional gravity @xcite , and was applied in the context of black hole thermodynamics to recover the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite with its logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "we showed , in both cases , that fixing the barbero - immirzi parameter to @xmath12 and performing at the same time the analytic continuation of the spin @xmath2 representations ( coloring the spin - networks edges ) to @xmath13 where @xmath4 is a real number reproduce exactly the expected results , i.e. the right geometric spectra in three dimensional gravity and the bekenstein - hawking formula for the black hole entropy .",
    "the group theoretical interpretation of this analytic continuation is clear and consists in replacing the unitary irreducible representations of @xmath9 by the principal ( continuous ) series of unitary representations of the non - compact gauge group @xmath14 to color the spin - networks edges .",
    "thus , these representations play apparently a very important role in three dimensional lqg and in black hole thermodynamics , but the question whether they are still relevant in the full theory in four dimensions is still widely open , and very complicated to answer . as a first step towards its resolution , it is interesting to apply the same analytic continuation in the context of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) where the dynamics is a priori non trivial ( contrary to three dimensional gravity where the theory is topological and contrary to black hole thermodynamics where we look at the system at equilibrium ) .",
    "we hope that such a model will help us understanding the quantization of the full complex theory of gravity and also finding our way towards the resolution of the reality conditions .",
    "the aim of this article is precisely to perform the analytic continuation to @xmath12 in the context of lqc .",
    "we consider the simplest cosmological model , namely the flat ( @xmath15 ) flrw cosmology coupled to a massless scalar field which plays , as usual in lqc , the role of a clock .",
    "we want to understand if the bounce scenario remains in the complex theory .",
    "to do so , we proceed in two steps .",
    "first of all , we compute the non - local curvature operator evaluated in any spin @xmath2 representations of @xmath9 .",
    "this operator is the building block of the hamiltonian constraint in lqc and has been computed so far mainly in the fundamental spin @xmath16 representation . to our knowledge",
    ", there is only one very interesting paper @xcite where the question of considering spins different from @xmath16 in lqc was studied ( to understand some quantum ambiguities in lqc ) .",
    "surprisingly , we find a new and simple closed formula for the non - local curvature operator in any finite dimensional representation .",
    "then , we can perform the analytic continuation of the curvature operator which consists in fixing @xmath0 and replacing the integer @xmath2 by the complex number @xmath13 where @xmath17 . we proceed exactly as we did in three dimensional lqg and black holes thermodynamics .",
    "we show that , even if the representations become continuous and then the area spectrum is now real , the curvature operator remains bounded after the analytic continuation , which means that the curvature is never singular during the history of the universe .",
    "therefore , the original singularity is resolved and generically replaced by a bounce .",
    "contrary to what happens in real lqc , the maximal density of the universe ( at the bounce ) is independent of @xmath1 ( which in fact has been fixed previously the @xmath18 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section 2 by a brief statement of the main aspects of lqc .",
    "we recall that the non - local curvature operator is the building block in the construction of the quantum dynamics .",
    "usually , it is evaluated in the spin @xmath16 representation to achieve the best possible coarse grained homogeneity . however , for our purpose ( in order to perform the analytic continuation ) , we need the expression of the non - local curvature operator evaluated in any spin @xmath2 representations .",
    "fortunately , we obtain a new simple and closed formula for it . in section 3 , we study the analytic continuation to @xmath0 and @xmath13 where @xmath17 .",
    "we write the regularized hamiltonian constraint ( with no inverse volume corrections ) in the complex theory . afterwards",
    "we show , in the effective theory framework first and also using the so - called exactly solvable lqc methods , that it leads generically to a resolution of the initial singularity and to the emergence of a quantum bounce .",
    "we finish with a discussion and some perspectives .",
    "the goal of this section is twofold .",
    "first , following @xcite , we briefly summarize the basis ( foundations , results and notations ) of lqc in the simplest cosmological space - time , i.e. the flat ( @xmath15 ) flrw model with no cosmological constant ( @xmath19 ) minimally coupled to a massless scalar field .",
    "we will recall in particular that the non - local curvature operator is the key ingredient inherited from quantum geometry in the construction of lqc .",
    "this operator is the loop regularization of the classical curvature and is responsible for the replacement of the original singularity by a bounce . in standard lqc",
    ", the non - local curvature operator is defined in the spin @xmath16 representation , namely it is given as the trace of the holonomy of the connection around a fundamental plaquette evaluated in the spin @xmath16 representation .",
    "the choice of the spin @xmath16 is clearly motivated by technical reasons ( it makes its computation much simpler and it makes the energy density of the massless scalar field positive ) but not only .",
    "it is commonly argued that the evaluation in the spin @xmath16 representation enables to achieve the best possible coarse grained homogeneity .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the spin @xmath16 can be further motivated by the assumption that the quanta of space are minimally excited and that the universe expands ( or contracts ) by adding quanta ( or removing quanta ) rather than changing the representations on the spins .",
    "however , we will need the evaluation of the non - local curvature operator in any spin @xmath2 representation for defining the analytic continuation .",
    "this is what we are going to do in a second part , and we will obtain a new simple and close formula for this evaluation .",
    "lqc is a proposal for quantizing cosmological space - times based on the philosophy of lqg . as in the full theory ,",
    "lqc is based on the ( ashtekar - barbero ) connection formulation of gravity , and the elementary variables are given by holonomies along edges and fluxes across surfaces associated to arbitrary graphs immersed in the space , viewed as a topological space . in the flat flrw cosmology , the topology of space is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 , the 3-torus , and to construct properly the canonical quantization of such cosmologies , it is necessary to introduce a non - dynamical fiducial metric on the space @xmath22 , together with a fiducial cell @xmath23 . typically , we choose the cell to be a cube whose length is @xmath24 with respect to the fiducial metric . concerning the fiducial metric , we fix it for simplicity to the flat metric @xmath25 even if this is not necessary a priori .",
    "a complete discussion on the fiducial dependence of the lqc phase space structure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy of space - time imply that we can choose the ashtekar - barbero connection @xmath26 and its conjugate electric field @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of time only . to these geometrical variables ,",
    "one adds the pair of conjugate variables @xmath31 to parametrize completely the phase space of an flrw cosmology minimally coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath32 .",
    "the hamiltonian analysis of the action of gravity coupled to the scalar field @xmath32 leads immediately to the following definition of the poisson brackets @xmath33 note that the choice of the normalization factors ( depending on @xmath24 ) in ( [ def of c and p ] ) makes the poisson bracket between the dynamical variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 independent of the fiducial structure . with this choice , the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 are not sensitive to the fiducial structure ( neither of the fiducial metric nor of the fiducial cell ) .",
    "therefore we can fix @xmath34 without loss of generality , which is what we do from now on .",
    "note however that the fiducial structure does not disappear in the quantum theory when one considers inverse volume corrections in the hamiltonian constraints , and the fiducial metric may also enter in the quantum uncertainties relations @xcite . to complete the description of the physical phase space , we add that the lapse @xmath35 is a non - dynamical variable in the theory , it plays the role of a lagrange multiplier which enforces the hamiltonian constraint @xmath36 given by ( note that in all this paper we will not consider the inverse volume corrections ) @xmath37 where the curvature of the connection @xmath38 reduces in the flrw model to the simple form @xmath39 this leads immediately to the following final expression for the total hamiltonian @xmath40 : @xmath41 as in pure gravity , @xmath36 is a first class constraint which is responsible for the invariance of the under time reparametrization of the theory .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian @xmath40 vanishes on shell and allows to define , as a hamiltonian vector field , time derivatives of any function @xmath42 of the phase space according to @xmath43 where the symbol @xmath44 refers to a weak identity ( i.e. the identity holds only on the constraints surface ) .",
    "the freedom in the choice of the lapse function @xmath35 corresponds to the gauge freedom to choose the time variable for the dynamics .",
    "the quantization of such a theory ( where the matter is a massless scalar field ) leads generically to a singularity at the origin of the universe in standard wheeler - dewitt quantum cosmology .",
    "the singular behavior of usual quantum cosmologies originates from the fact that the curvature ( [ curvature ] ) is unbounded from above , and then it can be infinite .",
    "this happens precisely at the origin of the universe .",
    "some scenario to resolve the singularity were proposed but none are totally convincing ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of them consisted in considering particular types of matter fields coupled to gravity .",
    "lqc proposes a much deeper scenario to avoid the singularity based on the fundamental structure of space inherited from lqg .",
    "physically , the resolution of the singularity can be viewed as a consequence of the discreteness of the geometric operators and more precisely of the existence of a minimal spacial surface , hence a minimal spacial volume for the universe . in that sense ,",
    "the minimal volume ( or equivalently the area gap ) plays the role of a uv cut - off in quantum cosmology .",
    "more rigorously , it is the particular structure of the kinematical hilbert space of lqg which is deeply responsible for the resolution of the original singularity . in full lqg ,",
    "the algebra of kinematical operators form the so - called holonomy - flux algebra which admits an unique unitary irreducible representation which behaves correctly under the action of space diffeomorphims ( the action is unitary ) @xcite .",
    "elements of the corresponding hilbert space are one - dimensional excitations associated to a graph @xmath45 immersed in the space and are constructed from the holonomy of the connection along the edges of the graph @xmath45 .",
    "the spin - network states form a dense basis of this hilbert space .",
    "they are totally characterized by a color graph , i.e. a graph whose edges are colored with spin @xmath2 representations of @xmath9 and whose nodes are colored with intertwiners between @xmath9 representations . as we will illustrate later on in the case of cosmology , the fact that fundamental excitations of quantum gravity are holonomies along edges of the connection and not the connection itself is intimately linked to the resolution of the singularity .    the hypothesis of homogeneity and isotropy simplify drastically the holonomy - flux algebra .",
    "indeed , spin - network states corresponding to cosmological quantum states are associated to graphs whose edges are parallel to the edges of the cell @xmath23 defined above in the introduction of this section .",
    "furthermore , it is commonly assumed that the edges are colored by a spin @xmath16 representation in order to achieve the best possible coarse grained homogeneity .",
    "as a consequence , holonomies @xmath46 of the ( homogeneous and isotropic ) ashtekar - barbero connection ( [ def of c and p ] ) along a line @xmath47 parallel to one of the edges of the cell @xmath23 and evaluated in the spin @xmath16 representation are the building blocks of kinematical states in lqc . if we denote by @xmath48 the length of @xmath47 with respect to the fiducial metric @xmath22 , it is immediate to show that @xmath49 where @xmath47 has been identified with its direction and then takes value in the set @xmath50 .",
    "here @xmath51 are the generators of @xmath52 evaluated in the fundamental representation , they satisfy the lie algebra relation @xmath53=\\epsilon_{ij}{}^k\\tau_k$ ] and the normalization property @xmath54 for any @xmath47 .",
    "we can choose a basis such that they are explicitly given by the following @xmath55 matrices : @xmath56 as we have just said in the general discussion above , fundamental variables in lqc kinematics are the elements @xmath46 , or equivalently they are ( complex ) exponentials of the connection @xmath29 and not the connection itself .",
    "it is important to note that one can not recover , for instance , the connection by a derivation of @xmath46 with respect to @xmath48 because the holonomy - flux algebra representation is not weakly continuous , hence deriving the holonomy operator @xmath46 is not a well - defined action .",
    "for that reason , the hamiltonian constraint @xmath36 , as it is written in ( [ totalh ] ) , is not a well - defined operator acting on the lqc kinematical states and needs to be regularized .",
    "the regularization is constructed as in gauge theory where the curvature ( [ curvature ] ) is expressed in terms of holonomy variables @xmath46 only .      the key point to find a suitable regularization of the curvature ( [ curvature ] )",
    "is the formulae @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the holonomy around a square plaquette whose edges are parallel to the directions @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the fiducial @xmath23 , @xmath61 its area with respect to the flat fiducial metric @xmath22 and @xmath62 denotes the trace of the element @xmath63 ( which belongs to the enveloping algebra of @xmath52 ) in the spin @xmath2 representation of dimension @xmath64 .",
    "the holonomy around the plaquette can be obviously expressed in terms of the holonomies @xmath65 and @xmath66 along the edges of length @xmath67 ( with respect to the fiducial metric fixed such that @xmath34 from the beginning ) and directions @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively as follows : @xmath68 from the quantum point of view , the limit where @xmath61 vanishes is not defined , again because of the lack of weak continuity property of the kinematical hilbert space representation ( known as the ashtekar - lewandowski representation ) .",
    "physically , we can say that the limit does not exist because the existence of a minimal area in the theory or equivalently an area gap forbids us to send the area of any surface to zero .",
    "at most , we can send the area to its minimal value ( the discreteness of the area spectrum is closely related to the continuity properties of the ashtekar - lewandowski representation ) . determining the minimal value of the area @xmath61 is equivalent to determining the expression of the minimal length @xmath67 of its edges . as we see from the notations , we work in the so - called improved @xmath67-scheme where it was shown that @xcite @xmath69 @xmath70 being the quantum of area ( in planck unit with @xmath71 ) carried by each edge of the spin - network state representing a homogeneous and isotropic quantum state of geometry .",
    "the consequence is that the classical curvature is replaced in lqc by a non - local curvature operator which clearly needs ordering prescriptions to be well - defined .    to be more explicit ,",
    "let us fix the spin in ( [ ftracej ] ) to the value @xmath72 as it is usually done in lqc .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact the quantum states in quantum cosmological are colored with spin @xmath16 representations ( to achieve the best possible coarse grained geometry ) , and then it is natural ( and technically simpler ) to define the curvature operator in term of holonomies evaluated in the 2-dimensional representation as well .",
    "nonetheless , we will shortly discuss this choice in the following subsection .",
    "when @xmath72 , @xmath70 reduces to the area gap @xmath73 and the expression of the holonomy ( [ hbox ] ) simplifies as follows : @xmath74 the calculation of the non - local curvature operator @xmath75 ( the hat notation allows to distinguish the local curvature from the quantum non - local one ) follows immediately : @xmath76 the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "of the previous equation is often omitted .",
    "the reason is that the curvature appears in the hamiltonian constraint ( [ localhamil ] ) in the form @xmath77 and then this second term disappears from the hamiltonian because of symmetry properties .",
    "in fact , it is implicitly assumed in the literature that @xmath47 is different from @xmath59 and @xmath60 when one writes the components @xmath78 of the curvature .    to simplify the study of the quantum dynamics",
    ", it is convenient to change variables and to consider @xmath79 instead of the original connection @xmath29 .",
    "the reason is that , at the classical level , @xmath60 is conjugated to the volume @xmath80 in the sense that @xmath81 , and this simplifies highly the resolution of the hamiltonian constraint as we are going to see shortly .",
    "when expressed in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath82 , the total hamiltonian ( [ totalh ] ) becomes @xmath83 this expression is the starting point of the study of the dynamics in lqc .",
    "there remain ordering ambiguities to understand when we promote the hamiltonian constraint as an operator acting on a suitable hilbert space .",
    "the reason is that the quantum operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding respectively to the quantizations of @xmath60 and @xmath82 are not commuting .",
    "these aspects have been deeply studied and were nicely reported in @xcite and @xcite for instance .",
    "there exists a simple way to see how the hamiltonian constraint ( [ nonlocalh ] ) leads generically to a bouncing universe in lqc without entering into the details of the quantization .",
    "the method we are talking about is known as the effective analysis of the dynamics . however , even if this method is qualitatively very interesting , it misses some important aspects that can be analyzed only from a rigorous analysis of the quantum theory .    in the effective analysis",
    ", one interprets the hamiltonian @xmath86 as a classical function and not as a quantum operator .",
    "then we immediately get the energy density of the scalar field from @xmath87 : @xmath88 therefore , we obtain directly a first indication of the existence of a bounce because @xmath89 , viewed as a function of @xmath60 , is now bounded ( compared to the standard wheeler - dewitt quantum cosmology ) with a maximum @xmath90 .",
    "this is fundamentally due to the finiteness of @xmath91 and then to the existence of an area gap in lqg .",
    "if the density energy is bounded , then there is no more singularity and they may exist a minimal volume of the universe .",
    "in fact , we can show that this is generically the case from a careful analysis of the quantum dynamics ( under some conditions on the quantum states ) .",
    "there is a second ( certainly more spectacular ) indication for the resolution of the initial singularity and the emergence of a bounce scenario .",
    "it is based on the the analysis of the modified friedmann equation induced by the dynamics of lqc .",
    "the modified friedmann equation is very easy to obtain and relies on the calculation of the time derivative of the volume @xmath92 where the time parameter is the cosmic time ( i.e. @xmath93 ) . from this straightforward computation ,",
    "we obtain ( the details can be found in @xcite for instance ) @xmath94 the scale factor @xmath59 is related to the volume by @xmath95 and @xmath96 represents the usual hubble parameter .",
    "the modified friedmann equation has been studied intensively @xcite and it can be shown precisely that it describes a bouncing universe . without going to the details , it is easy to see that the universe admits a minimal volume which is reached when @xmath97 ( whence @xmath98 )",
    ". furthermore , everything happens as if the quantum gravity effects manifest themselves at the origin as a pressure which forbids the universe from collapsing and then removes the original singularity .",
    "the regularization of the curvature operator is the cornerstone of lqc .",
    "it is mathematically based on the techniques used in full lqg and it is physically responsible for the resolution of the initial singularity . however , the regularization procedure is not unique and suffers from ambiguities .",
    "the main ambiguity relies on the choice of the spin @xmath2 representation in ( [ ftracej ] ) . by construction ,",
    "the classical curvature does not depend on that choice but the value of the spin @xmath2 becomes relevant at the quantum level , when the limit @xmath99 is replaced by @xmath100 in ( [ ftracej ] ) .",
    "some aspects of this ambiguity were studied in @xcite and similar ones in the full theory were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the article @xcite has been , to our knowledge , the only one to discuss the choice of the spin in the regularization of the curvature operator for lqc .    to have a deeper understanding of the role of @xmath2 in the regularization of the curvature",
    ", it would be much better to have an explicit and simple expression of the trace @xmath101 involved in the definition of the non - local curvature operator , which is missing up to our knowledge ( in @xcite the trace was expressed as a finite sum only ) .",
    "but we are going to provide in this section a new and simple expression for the trace in any spin @xmath2 representation .",
    "this new formula is clearly a good starting point for the study of the ambiguity we mentioned above and its effects on the dynamics of lqc .",
    "however , we are not interested in studying this aspect here that we postpone for later @xcite .",
    "we are more interested in the analytic continuation of lqc to complex barbero - immirzi parameters , more precisely to @xmath0 . however , we argued in the introduction that fixing @xmath12 in lqg is meaningless a part if we send at the same time the discrete spin @xmath2 representations ( coloring the spin - network edges ) to the complex values @xmath13 . to adapt this construction in the context of lqc",
    ", we need to write the non - local curvature , hence @xmath101 , as an analytic function of @xmath2 ( and also @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is exactly what we are going to do in this section .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "to lighten the notations , we choose to compute @xmath102 , the other components will be directly obtained from permutations between the indices .",
    "first we remark that @xmath103 then the calculation reduces in computing the trace of the group element @xmath104 in the spin @xmath2 representation .",
    "we know from representation theory that such a trace is given by the character @xmath105 where @xmath106 $ ] is the conjugacy class of @xmath107 .",
    "now , the point is that we can obtain the angle @xmath108 using the @xmath52 fundamental representation where @xmath107 is a 2-dimensional matrix which can be easily computed from ( [ hboxab ] ) .",
    "then a direct calculation leads to : @xmath109 the expression of ( [ defh123 ] ) in terms of the variable @xmath60 follows immediately : @xmath110 note that the angle @xmath111 with no @xmath112 dependence is defined by @xmath113 .",
    "its expression in terms of @xmath60 is obtained from the relation ( [ thetab ] ) between @xmath60 and @xmath108 with @xmath114 , and a short calculation leads to : @xmath115 which defines totally @xmath116 $ ] in terms of @xmath60 . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "the relevant components of the non - local curvature operator regularized using the spin @xmath2 representation ( of dimension @xmath117 ) are given by @xmath118 ( when @xmath119 ) with : @xmath120 note that @xmath121 should take different values depending on the choice of the spin @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath67-scheme , it has been argued that @xmath70 represents the quantum of area ( in planck units ) carried by spin - network describing lqc quantum states .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then @xmath122 .",
    "one could also argue that @xmath70 is simply the area gap ( the minimal area ) in planck units of lqg in which case it is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we finish this section with some examples .    1 .",
    "when @xmath72 ( d=2 ) we recover immediately the expression ( [ nonlocalf ] ) .",
    "when @xmath123 ( d=3 ) we find after a straightforward calculation : @xmath124    for any finite values of @xmath2 , the dynamics of lqc leads to a resolution of the singularity since the non - local curvature is bounded from above , and so is the energy density .",
    "however , the dynamics is modified and depends strongly on the choice of the representation .",
    "these aspects have been explored in @xcite and are revisited in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly underline some difficulties which may arise for @xmath125 . from @xmath126 and defining the energy density of the matter content by @xmath127 one easily gets the modified friedmann equation relating @xmath89 to the non - local curvature for any @xmath2 : @xmath128 the shape of the r.h.s . of the above",
    "is displayed in fig .",

    "<S> we construct and study loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) when the barbero - immirzi parameter takes the complex value @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this new quantum cosmology as complex loop quantum cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we proceed in making an analytic continuation of the hamiltonian constraint ( with no inverse volume corrections ) from real @xmath1 to @xmath0 in the simple case of a flat flrw universe coupled to a massless scalar field with no cosmological constant . for that purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the non - local curvature operator ( defined by the trace of the holonomy of the connection around a fundamental plaquette ) evaluated in any spin @xmath2 representation and we find a new close formula for it . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to define explicitly a one parameter family of regularizations of the hamiltonian constraint in lqc , parametrized by the spin @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is immediate to see that any spin @xmath2 regularization leads to a bounce scenario . </S>",
    "<S> then , motivated particularly by previous results on black hole thermodynamics , we perform the analytic continuation of the hamiltonian constraint defined by @xmath0 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is real . even if the area spectrum is now continuous , we show that the so - defined complex lqc removes also the original singularity which is replaced by a quantum bounce . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the maximal density and the minimal volume of the universe are obviously independent of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the dynamics before and after the bounce are no more symmetric , which makes a clear distinction between these two phases of the evolution of the universe . </S>"
