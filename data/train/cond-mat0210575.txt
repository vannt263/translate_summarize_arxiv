    "in many industrial and technological processes the design of desired chemicals requires the binding of chemically inactive molecules , which recombine only when some third substance - the catalytic substrate - is present @xcite . within the two past decades",
    "much effort has been put in understanding of the peculiarities of such catalytically - activated reactions ( cars ) . on one hand ,",
    "much progress was made in answering the question why and how specific catalytic substrates promote reactions between chemically inactive molecules ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) . on the other hand , considerable theoretical knowledge was gained from an extensive study of a particular reaction - the co - oxidation in the presence of metal surfaces with catalytic properties @xcite ( for a recent review se , , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . while the first aspect @xcite sheds light on catalysation mechanisms and",
    "may allow the calculation of @xmath7 - the rate at which two reactants react being in the vicinity of each other and a specific catalytic substrate , the results of refs.@xcite show that the mere knowledge of @xmath7 is not sufficient . as a matter of fact",
    ", refs.@xcite have substantiated the emergence of an essentially different behavior as compared to the predictions of the classical , formal - kinetics scheme and have shown that under certain conditions such collective phenomena as phase transitions or the formation of bifurcation patterns may take place @xcite .",
    "prior to these works on catalytic systems , anomalous behavior was amply demonstrated in other schemes @xcite , involving reactions on contact between two particles at any point of the reaction volume ( i.e. , the `` completely '' catalytic sysems ) .",
    "it was realized @xcite that the departure from the text - book , formal - kinetic predictions is due to many - particle effects , associated with fluctuations in the spatial distribution of the reacting species .",
    "this suggests that similarly to such `` completely '' catalytic reaction schemes , the behavior of the cars may be influenced by many - particle effects .",
    "apart from the many - particle effects , behavior of the cars might be affected by the very structure of the catalytic substrate , which is often not well - defined geometrically , but must be viewed as being an assembly of mobile or localized catalytic sites or islands , whose spatial distribution is complex @xcite .",
    "metallic catalysts , for instance , are often disordered compact aggregates , the building blocks of which are imperfect crystallites with broken faces , kinks and steps .",
    "usually only the steps are active in promoting the reaction and thus the effective catalytic substrate is the geometrical pattern formed by these steps .",
    "another example is furnished by porous materials with convoluted surfaces , such as , e.g. , silica , alumina or carbons . here",
    "the effective catalytic substrate is also only a portion of the total surface area because of the selective participation of different surface sites to the reaction - closed pores or pores with very small , bottleneck entrances are inaccessible to many reacting molecules .",
    "finally , for liquid - phase catalytically - activated reactions the catalyst can consist of active groups attached to polymer chains in solution .",
    "such complex morphologies render the theoretical analysis difficult . as yet , only empirical approaches have been used to account for the impact of the geometrical complexity on the behavior of the cars , based mostly on heuristic concepts of effective reaction order or on phenomenological generalizations of the formal - kinetic `` law of mass action '' ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite and @xcite for more details ) . in this way",
    "the parameters entering the equations describing the observables ( say , the mean particles densities ) are fixed by fits to experimental data and can deviate from the values prescribed by the stoichiometric relations of the reactions involved .",
    "the important outcome of such descriptions is that they provide an evidence of the existing correlations in the morphology of the chemically reactive environment . on the other hand ,",
    "their shortcoming is that they do not explain the mechanisms underlying the anomalous kinetic and stationary behavior . in this",
    "regard , analytical studies of even somewhat idealized or simplified models , such as , for instance , the ones proposed in refs.@xcite , are already highly desirable since such studies may provide an understanding of the effects of different factors on the properties of the cars .",
    "in this paper we study the properties of catalytically - activated annihilation @xmath0 reaction in a simple , one - dimensional model with random distribution of the catalyst , appropriate to the just mentioned situation with the catalytically - activated reactions on polymer chains .",
    "more specifically , we consider here the @xmath0 reaction on a one - dimensional regular lattice which is brought in contact with a reservoir of @xmath4 partilces .",
    "some portion of the intersite intervals ( thick black lines in fig.1 ) on the regular lattice possesses special `` catalytic '' properties such that they induce an immediate reaction @xmath0 , as soon as two @xmath4 particles land onto two vacant sites at the extremities of the catalytic segment , or an @xmath4 particle lands onto a vacant site while the site at the other extremity of the catalytic segment is already occupied by another @xmath4 particle .",

    "( a ) denotes a `` forbidden '' particle configuration , which corresponds to immediate reaction .",
    "( b ) depicts the situation in which two neighboring @xmath4 particles may harmlessly coexist . ]",
    "we present here an exact solution of this model in two cases - a case when disorder in placement of the catalytic segments can be viewed as @xmath8 , and a more complex situation with a @xmath9 random distribution of the catalytic segments , and show that despite the apparent oversimplified nature of the model it exhibits an interesting non - trivial behavior",
    ". a brief account of these results has been presented in our earlier short publication @xcite .",
    "we note finally that kinetics of @xmath0 reactions involving diffusive @xmath4 particles which react upon encounters on randomly placed catalytic sites has been discussed already in refs.@xcite and @xcite , and a rather surprising behavior has been found , especially in low - dimensional systems .",
    "additionally , steady - state properties of @xmath0 reactions between immobile @xmath4 particles with long - range reaction probabilities in systems with external particles input have been presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite and revealed non - trivial ordering phenomena with anomalous input intensity dependence of the mean particle density , which agrees with early experimental findings @xcite .",
    "for completely catalytic 1d systems , kinetics of @xmath0 reactions with immobile @xmath4 particles undergoing cooperative desorption have been discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "exact solutions for @xmath0 reactions in 1d completely catalytic systems in which @xmath4 particles perform conventional diffusive or subdiffusive motion have been presented in refs.@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we define the model and introduce basic notations . in section 3 we focus on the case of @xmath8 disorder and derive exact closed - form expressions for the pressure per site , as well as present explicit asymptotic expansions in powers of the activity for the mean particle density and the compressibility . in section 4",
    "we examine the case of @xmath9 disorder .",
    "here , we show that the thermodynamic limit result for the disorder - averaged pressure per site can be obtained very directly by noticing a similarity between the expressions defining the pressure in the model under study and the lyapunov exponent of a product of random two - by - two matrices , obtained by derrida and hilhorst @xcite .",
    "we also derive an explicit expression obeyed by the averaged logarithm of the partition function , which is valid for any chain s length @xmath1 , and present its large-@xmath1 expansion ; we show , in particular , that the first correction to the thermodynamic limit result for the disorder - averaged pressure per site is proportional to the first negative power of @xmath1 . explicit asymptotic expansions for the mean particle density and the compressibility are also derived .",
    "finally , in section 5 we conclude with a brief summary of our results and discussion .",
    "consider a one - dimensional regular lattice of unit spacing comprising @xmath1 adsorption sites in contact with a reservoir ( vapor phase ) of identical , non - interacting hard - core @xmath4 particles ( see , fig.1 ) . the reservoir is steadily maintained at a constant pressure .",
    "the @xmath4 particles from the vapor phase can adsorb onto vacant adsorption sites and desorb back to the reservoir .",
    "the occupation of the `` i''-th adsorption site is described by the boolean variable @xmath10 , such that @xmath11    suppose next that some of the segments - intervals between neighboring adsorption sites possess `` catalytic '' properties ( thick black lines in fig.1 ) in the sense that they induce an immediate reaction @xmath0 , as soon as two @xmath4 particles land onto two vacant sites at the extremities of the catalytic segment , or an @xmath4 particle lands onto a vacant site at one extremety of the catalytic segment while the site at the other extremity of this segment is already occupied by another @xmath4 particle .",
    "two reacted @xmath4 particles instantaneously leave the lattice ( desorb back to the reservoir ) .",
    "any two @xmath4 particle adsorbed at extremities of a non - catalytic segment harmlessly coexist .    to specify the positions of the catalytic segments , we introduce the quenched variable @xmath12 , so",
    "that @xmath13 and @xmath14    now , for a given distribution of the catalytic segments , the partition function @xmath15 of the system under study can be written as follows : @xmath16 where the summation @xmath17 extends over all possible configurations @xmath18 , while @xmath19 denotes the activity , @xmath20 @xmath21 being the chemical potential , which accounts for the reservoir pressure and for the particles preference for adsorption .",
    "note that @xmath15 in eq.([partition ] ) is a functional of the configuration @xmath22 .",
    "it might be instructive to remark that @xmath15 can be also thought of as a one - dimensional version of models describing adsorption of hard - molecules @xcite",
    ", i.e. adsorption limited by the `` kinetic '' constraint that any two of the molecules can neither occupy the same site nor appear on the neighboring sites .",
    "the most celebrated examples of such models are furnished by the so - called `` hard - squares '' model @xcite , or by the `` hard - hexagons '' model first solved exactly by baxter @xcite .",
    "these models ehxibit phase transitions .",
    "the universal classification of phase transitions is known to depend on the dimensionality , the presence of further interactions and the way in which the lattice can be partitioned into sublattices . for bipartite lattices and interactions dominated by nearest - neighbor exclusion ,",
    "the ordering transition is the result of competition between the two sublattice densities .",
    "the phase transition is thus associated with a breaking of the symmetry between these two sublattices . for geometrically more complex baxter",
    "s hard - hexagon model , which consists of particles with the nearest - neighbor exclusion on the triangular lattice , the phase transition belongs to the three - state potts model universality class , in accordance with the fact that the phase transition is associated with symmetry breaking involving three competing equivalent sublattice densities . for more discussion see ref.@xcite .    in our case of the cars on random catalytic substrates the nearest - neighbor exclusion constraint",
    "is introduced only locally , at some specified , randomly distributed intervals .",
    "such locally frustrated models of random reaction / adsorption thus represent a natural and meaningful generalization of the well - studied exclusion models over systems with disorder .",
    "of course , in this context two - dimensional situations are of most interest , but nonetheless it might be instructive to find examples of such models which can be solved exactly in one dimension .    our main goal here is to calculate the disorder - average pressure per site : @xmath23 where the angle brackets with the subscript @xmath24 here and henceforth denote averaging over all possible configurations @xmath25 . in this case , we suppose that @xmath12 are quenched , independent , randomly distributed variables with distribution @xmath26 as well , we will consider the case when the disorder in placement of the catalytic segments can be viewed as @xmath8 and the mean density of the catalytic segments is equal to @xmath3 ; in this case , which requires much simplier analysis , the pressure per site is given by @xmath27 we note that such a situation can be realized in practice in case when the catalytic agents , modelled here as the catalytic segments , diffuse .",
    "on the other hand , an assumption of the @xmath8 disorder is often used as a meaningful `` mean - field '' approximation for systems with quenched disorder .",
    "hence , it might be instructive to consider this case in order to check the behavior provided by such a mean - field approach against an exact solution in the quenched disorder case .",
    "once @xmath28 are obtained , all other pertinent thermodynamic properties can be readily evaluated by differentiating @xmath28 with respect to the chemical potential @xmath21 ; in particular , the disorder - average mean particle density @xmath29 will be given by @xmath30 while the compressibility @xmath31 obeys @xmath32 we set out to show that for both @xmath8 and @xmath9 disorder cases , when @xmath12 are independent , two - state random variables all these functions can be evaluated explicitly , in a closed form .",
    "we will distinguish between these two cases by assigning superscripts @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    to close this section",
    ", we display the results corresponding to two `` regular '' cases : namely , when @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which will serve us in what follows as some benchmarks . in the @xmath35 all sites",
    "are decoupled , and one has the trivial langmuir adsorption results : @xmath37 and @xmath38 the `` regular '' case when @xmath36 is a bit less trivial , but the solution can be still straightforwardly obtained . in this case , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 note that in the @xmath41 case ( the completely catalytic system ) the mean particle density tends to @xmath42 as @xmath43 ( compared to @xmath44 behavior observed for the langmuir case ) , which means that the adsorbent undergoes `` ordering '' transition and particles distribution on the lattice becomes periodic revealing a spontaneous symmetry breaking between two sublattices . in the limit @xmath43 the compressibility vanishes as @xmath45 compared to the langmuir behavior @xmath46 .",
    "we start our analysis of the random reaction / adsorption model considering first the situation in which the disorder in placement of the catalytic segments can be viewed as @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", the disorder - averaged pressure per site is defined by eq.([8 ] ) and thus has a more simple form than that in eq.([3 ] ) , since we have to perform averaging not of the logarithm of the partition function in eq.([partition ] ) but of the partition function itself .",
    "averaging of the partition function in eq.([partition ] ) over the distribution of the catalytic segments can be performed very directly and yields @xmath48 since @xmath49 , the result in the latter equation can be thought of as a partition function of a one - dimensional lattice gas with nearest - neigbour repulsive interactions of amplitude @xmath50 .",
    "note that here the original constraint that no two particle can be located simultaneously at the extremeties of the catalytic segments is replaced by a more tolerant condition that the particles may occupy neighboring sites anywhere , but the penalty of @xmath51 has to be paid . for any finite @xmath52",
    "this penalty can be overpassed by increasing the chemical potential and hence , for large @xmath19 one may thus expect completely different behavior in the annealed and quenched disorder cases . on the other hand , for @xmath53 this penalty gets infinitely large and thus @xmath36 is a special point .    now , to find an explicit form of @xmath54 we proceed as follows .",
    "let us first introduce an auxiliary , constrained partition function of the form @xmath55 i.e. @xmath56 stands for the partition function of a one - dimensional lattice gas with a nearest - neighbor repulsion and fixed occupation of the site @xmath57 , @xmath58 . evidently , we have that @xmath59 next , considering two possible values of the occupation variable @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ", we find that @xmath56 can be expressed through @xmath63 and @xmath64 as @xmath65 now , recursion in eq.([1 ] ) allows us to eliminate @xmath56 in eq.([2 ] ) . from eq.([1 ] ) we have @xmath66 , and consequently , we find from eq.([2 ] ) that the unconstrained partition function @xmath54 in eq.([partition5 ] ) obeys the following recursion @xmath67 which is to be solved subject to evident initial conditions @xmath68 solution of the recursion in eq.([rec1 ] ) can be readily obtained by standard means , i.e. evaluating the generating function for @xmath54 , @xmath69 , and then inverting it with respect to the variable @xmath70 , which yields @xmath71 where @xmath72 noticing next that @xmath73 we find that in the annealed disorder case in the thermodynamic limit the disorder average pressure per site is given by @xmath74,\\ ] ] which expression is valid for any @xmath19 and @xmath3 .",
    "consider now the asymptotic small-@xmath19 and large-@xmath19 behavior of the pressure @xmath75 , the mean density @xmath76 and the compressibility @xmath77 .",
    "expanding @xmath75 in eq.([ll ] ) into the taylor series in powers of the activity @xmath19 , we find that in the small-@xmath19 limit @xmath75 follows : @xmath78 note that @xmath75 in eq.([ann ] ) reduces to @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . from eq.([ann ] ) we find that in the annealed disorder case in the small-@xmath19 limit the mean particle density is given by @xmath81 while the compressibility obeys @xmath82 we consider next the asymptotic behavior of @xmath75 in the large-@xmath19 limit .",
    "we notice first that here @xmath36 is actually a special point ; that is , asymptotic large-@xmath19 behavior of @xmath75 is completely different for @xmath52 and @xmath36 ( completely catalytic systems ) . for @xmath52 and @xmath83",
    ", we have that the asymptotic expansion of @xmath75 reads @xmath84 while in the regular , completely catalytic case @xmath36 it follows @xmath85 consequences of such a difference can be seen in a dramatically different behavior of the mean particle density . for @xmath52 and @xmath83",
    "we find @xmath86 while in the regular case @xmath36 the mean particle density is given by @xmath87 this signifies , in particular , that for @xmath3 arbitrarily close but not equal to unity , the mean density is equal to @xmath88 as @xmath89 , while for @xmath3 strictly equal to unity the mean density @xmath90 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath19 for different values of @xmath3 is depicted in fig.3 .    in a similar fashion",
    "we find that asymptotic behavior of the compressibility @xmath31 is very different for @xmath52 and @xmath36 . for @xmath52 and @xmath83",
    ", @xmath77 obeys @xmath91 while for @xmath36 and @xmath92 it follows @xmath93    finally , we realize that in the @xmath8 disorder case for any fixed @xmath19 the compressibility @xmath77 appears to be a @xmath94 function of @xmath3 .",
    "to see this , it suffices to notice that , first , @xmath95 , i.e. for any fixed @xmath19 the value of the compressibility for @xmath35 is always less or equal to its value for @xmath36 .",
    "second , one readily finds that in the vicinity of @xmath36 the compressibility @xmath77 obeys @xmath96 i.e. for any @xmath19 the value @xmath97 corresponding to @xmath36 is approached from above .",
    "consequently , for any fixed @xmath19 the compressibility @xmath98 is a non - monotoneous function of the mean density @xmath3 of the catalytic segments .",
    "behavior of the compressibility @xmath77 as a function of @xmath3 for several different values of @xmath19 is presented in fig.4 .",
    "we turn now to the more complex situation with a quenched disorder , in which case , in order to define the disorder - averaged pressure , we have to perform averaging of the logarithm of the partition function in eq.([partition ] ) .",
    "consequently , here we aim to determine the recursions obeyed by@xmath15 and @xmath99 .",
    "we proceed here along essentially the same lines as in the previous section .",
    "we introduce first a constrained partition function of the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 now stands for the partition function of a system with fixed set @xmath22 and fixed occupation of the site @xmath57 , @xmath58 . similarly to eq.([1 ] ) , we have that @xmath15 obeys @xmath102 next , considering two possible values of the occupation variable @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we find that @xmath101 can be expressed through @xmath103 and @xmath104 as @xmath105 which parallels the result in eq.([2 ] ) . eliminating @xmath101 in eq.([22 ] ) , we find eventually that the unconstrained partition function @xmath15 in eq.([partition ] ) obeys the following recursion : @xmath106 which is to be solved subject to the initial conditions in eq.([bc ] ) .",
    "a conventional way ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) to study linear random three - term recursions is to reduce them to random maps by introducing the ricatti variable of the form @xmath107 in terms of this variable eq.([rec11 ] ) becomes @xmath108 which represents a random homographic relation .",
    "once @xmath109 is defined for arbitrary @xmath1 , the partition function @xmath15 can be readily determined as the product , @xmath110 and hence , the desired disorder - average logarithm of the partition function will be obtained as @xmath111    before we proceed further on , some comments on the recursion in eq.([rec2 ] ) are in order .",
    "we recall first that , by definition , each quenched random variable @xmath112 assumes only two values - @xmath88 ( with probability @xmath3 ) and @xmath113 ( with probability @xmath114 ) .",
    "hence , we may formally rewrite the random homographic relation in eq.([rec2 ] ) as @xmath115    note now that recursion schemes of quite a similar form have been discussed already in the literature in different contexts . in particular , two decades ago derrida and hilhorst @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a more general discussion ) have shown that such recursions occur in the analysis of the lyapunov exponent @xmath116 of the product of random @xmath117 matrices of the form @xmath118\\big)\\big>_{\\{z_i\\}},\\ ] ] where @xmath119 are independent positive random variables with a given probability distribution @xmath120 .",
    "equation ( [ pp ] ) is related , for instance , to the disorder - average free energy of an ising chain with nearest - neighbor interactions in a random magnetic field , described by the hamiltonian @xmath121 in which one sets @xmath122 and @xmath123 . as noticed in ref.@xcite , the product in eq.([pp ] ) also appears in the solution of a two - dimensional ising model with row - wise random vertical interactions @xcite , the role of @xmath124 being played by the wavenumber @xmath125 .",
    "the recurence scheme in eq.([rec5 ] ) emerges also in such an interesting context as the problem of enumeration of primitive words with random errors in the locally free and braid groups @xcite .",
    "some other examples of physical systems in which the recursion in eq.([rec5 ] ) appears can be found in @xcite .    further on , derrida and hilhorst @xcite have demonstrated that @xmath116 can be expressed as @xmath126 where @xmath127 are defined through the recursion @xmath128 moreover , they have shown that the model admits an exact solution when @xmath129 i.e. when similarly to the model under study , @xmath119 are independent , random two - state variables assuming only two values - @xmath130 with probability @xmath3 and @xmath113 with probability @xmath131 .",

    "consequently , the disorder - average pressure per site in our random catalytic reaction / adsorption model can be expressed as @xmath143 where @xmath116 is the lyapunov exponent of the product of random @xmath117 matrices in eq.([pp ] ) , in which @xmath124 and @xmath119 are defined by eqs.([dist ] ) and ( [ def ] ) .",
    "note next that the first term on the right - hand - side of eq.([press ] ) is a trivial langmuir result for the @xmath35 case ( adsorption without reaction ) which would entail @xmath144 .",
    "hence , all non - trivial , disorder - induced behavior is embodied in the lyapunov exponent @xmath116 .",
    "we hasten to remark , however , that despite some coincidence of results , the random reaction / adsorption model under study has completely different underlying physics , as compared to the model studied by derrida and hilhorst @xcite .",
    "thus , one would not expect any singular overall behavior of pressure in the @xmath137 limit ( which corresponds here to the limit of vanishingly small activities @xmath19 ( or @xmath145 ) , and thus pertains to @xmath146 ) . in consequence , here",
    "@xmath130 is also dependent on @xmath19 and @xmath147 in the same manner as @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , in our case @xmath148 , which invalidates the condition in eq.([limit ] ) .",
    "the disorder - averaged pressure per site can be thus readily obtained from eqs.([k ] ) and ( [ k1 ] ) by defining the parameters @xmath130 and @xmath124 as prescribed in eq.([def ] ) .",

    "can be performed in a very straightforward manner without resorting to the assumption on existence of a stationary probability distribution @xmath133 ; the intermediate steps of such a derivation contain useful formulae , which might be helpful for the understanding of the asymptotic behavior of eq.([array5 ] ) .",
    "since it allows us to answer also the question of how the thermodynamic limit is achieved , we find it expedient to present such a derivation here .    we start with calculation of an explicit form of @xmath157 .",
    "to do it , it suffices to notice the following two points : first , we notice that @xmath158 and @xmath159 i.e. @xmath160 depends only on @xmath161 with @xmath162 and is independent of @xmath163 .",
    "second , with probability @xmath114 the ricatti variable is set equal to @xmath164 , i.e. to its initial value @xmath165 , which is a non - random function .",

    "as a matter of fact , already for @xmath154 one has that in the limit @xmath205 the approximant @xmath179 tends to @xmath206 , i.e. the logarithm of the `` golden mean '' , which is known as the irrational number worst approximated by rationals .",
    "moreover , for @xmath43 the convergence is irregular in the sense that only the approximants with odd numbers show the same large-@xmath19 behavior as @xmath200 ; the approximants with even @xmath29 all tend as @xmath43 to finite values @xmath207 ( see , fig.2 ) .",
    "plot of the approximants @xmath179 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and @xmath200 versus activity @xmath19 . ]",
    "we turn now back to the result in eq.([pressure ] ) aiming to find a convenient representation more amenable for further analysis . to do this ,",
    "let us note that @xmath179 in eq.([f ] ) can be expressed as the logarithm of the convergents of the stiltjes - type continued fractions : @xmath210 where @xmath211 are polynomials of the activity @xmath19 defined through the three - term recursion is just the partition function in eq.([partition ] ) for a chain of length @xmath29 in the completely catalytic @xmath36 system , i.e. @xmath212 . ] @xmath213 these polynomials can be , of course , obtained very directly by introducing their generating function , but we can avoid doing it by merely noticing that they are simply related , in view of the form of the recursion in eq.([rec7 ] ) , to the so - called golden or fibonacci polynomials @xmath214 @xcite , which are defined by the three - term recursion of the form @xmath215 on comparing the recursions in eqs.([rec7 ] ) and ( [ fib ] ) , one infers that @xmath216 hence , the approximant @xmath179 can be expressed as @xmath217 note that even at this stage one may understand where from such functions as @xmath152 appear in the expression for the disorder - average pressure in eq.([array5 ] ) ( first term on the rhs ) .",
    "the point is that , similarly to the fibonacci numbers @xmath218 , which obey @xmath219 , the ratio of two consequitive golden polynomials @xmath220 and @xmath221 also converges as @xmath205 to a finite limit given by the function @xmath222 .",
    "one expects hence that the rest of terms on the rhs of eq.([array5 ] ) stems from the finite-@xmath29 effects and describes the relaxation of the logarithm of @xmath223 to @xmath200 .    to determine the relaxation terms ,",
    "one uses the standard definition for the fibonacci polynomials : @xmath224\\ ] ] in virtue of this formula , one finds that the ratio of two consequitive golden polynomials obeys @xmath225}{\\big[\\displaystyle 1   + ( -1)^n \\omega^{n+1}\\big]}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath226 has been defined in eq.([omega ] ) .",
    "consequently , we find that the @xmath29-th approximant @xmath179 is given by @xmath227}{\\big[\\displaystyle 1   + ( -1)^n \\omega^{n+1}\\big]}\\right),\\ ] ] where , as we have already remarked , the first term on the rhs of eq.([last ] ) corresponds to the limiting form of the approximants , while the second term determines the relaxation to this limiting form ; more specifically , to the leading order this relaxation is described by an exponential function @xmath228 .",
    "consequently , one expects a fast convergence in case when @xmath19 is small ( @xmath226 is small ) and poor convergence when @xmath43 ( @xmath229 ) . substituting eq.([last ] ) into eq.([pressure ] ) we recover , upon some straightforward algebra , the result in eq.([array5 ] ) .",
    "consider first the small-@xmath19 behavior of the disorder - average pressure per site , defined by eq.([array5 ] ) . as we have already remarked , expanding the @xmath29-th approximant @xmath179 into the taylor series in powers of @xmath19 , one has that the first @xmath29 terms of such an expansion coincide with the first @xmath29 terms of the expansion @xmath230 which implies that @xmath179 and @xmath202 differ only by terms of order @xmath203 and allows to obtain very directly a convergent small-@xmath19 expansion of the pressure @xmath198 .",
    "we find then @xmath231 consequently , in the small-@xmath19 limit the mean density obeys @xmath232 while the compressibility @xmath233 follows @xmath234 note now that the expressions in eqs.([pppp ] ) to ( [ kk ] ) differ from their counterparts obtained in the @xmath8 disorder case , eqs.([ann ] ) , ( [ ann1 ] ) and ( [ ann2 ] ) , only starting from the terms proportional to the fourth power of the activity @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "the coefficients in the small-@xmath19 expansion nonetheless coincide with the coefficients in the expansions of @xmath235 and @xmath236 when we set in eq.([pppp ] ) @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "now , we turn to the analysis of the large-@xmath19 behavior which is a bit more complex than the @xmath237 case and requires understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the sum @xmath238 entering eq.([pressure ] ) .",
    "we note first that in this sum the behavior of the terms with odd and even @xmath1 is quite different and we have to consider it separately .",
    "let @xmath239 denote the contribution of the terms with odd @xmath1 .",
    "note that when @xmath43 ( i.e. @xmath229 ) the sum @xmath240 tends to @xmath241 .",
    "the corrections to this limiting behavior can be defined as follows .",
    "expanding the logarithm @xmath242 into the taylor series in powers of @xmath226 and then , using the definition @xmath243 and the binomial expansion , we construct a series in the inverse powers of @xmath152 . this yields @xmath244 note that this expansion is only meaningful when @xmath245 , ( @xmath83 ) , which signifies that @xmath36 is also a special point for the quenched disorder case .",
    "further on , plugging into the latter expansion the definition of @xmath152 , @xmath246 , we obtain the following expansion in the inverse powers of the activity @xmath19 : @xmath247     the mean density of adsorbed particles versus the chemical potential @xmath248 for the annealed ( curves tending to unity ) and quenched disorder case for different values of the mean density @xmath3 of the catalytic segments . ]",
    "the compressibility @xmath249 versus the mean density @xmath3 of the catalytic segments for several values of the activity @xmath19 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "upper , non - monotoneous curves show the behavior of @xmath249 in the @xmath8 disorder case , while the lower curves correspond to the solution in the @xmath9 disorder case . ]",
    "consider next the sum @xmath252 which represents the contribution of terms with even @xmath1 .",
    "note that in contrast to the behavior of @xmath240 , the sum in eq.([even ] ) diverges when @xmath43 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "since @xmath253 for @xmath229 , we have that in this limit @xmath254 to obtain several correction terms we make use of one of gessel s expansions @xcite : @xmath255 where @xmath256 are the dedekind - type sums of the form @xmath257 where the summation extends over all @xmath24 being the @xmath258-th roots of unity ( with @xmath259 excluded ) .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the weights @xmath256 are polynomials in @xmath1 of degree at most @xmath260 with rational coefficients ; first few values of @xmath256 are : @xmath261 now , setting @xmath262 in the expansion in eq.([gessel ] ) , plugging it to eq.([even ] ) and performing summations over @xmath1 , we find that @xmath263 can be written down as @xmath264 where @xmath265 is an infinite series of the form shows a non - analytic behavior when @xmath266 .",
    "this function can be represented as @xmath267 where @xmath268 are the lerch transcedents , @xmath269 .",
    "it is straightforward to find then that @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the euler constant . ] @xmath272 while @xmath273 are the generating functions of the polynomials @xmath256 : @xmath274 inserting next the definition of @xmath152 , we find the following explicit asymptotic expansion @xmath275 finally , combining the expansions in eqs.([pressure ] ) , ( [ mmm ] ) and ( [ j2 ] ) , we find the desired large-@xmath19 expansion for the disorder - averaged pressure @xmath198 : @xmath276 note that @xmath198 in eq.([presq ] ) shows a completely different behavior compared to its counterpart in the annealed disorder case already in the leading term in the large-@xmath19 expansion . note",
    "also that here @xmath36 appears to be a special point and thus the expansion in eq.([presq ] ) becomes meaningless for @xmath36 . as a matter of fact , for @xmath3 arbitrarily close but less than unity one has intervals which are devoid of the catalytic segments .",
    "contribution of such intervals to the overall disorder - average pressure is of a langmuir - type and vanishes only when @xmath3 is strictly equal to unity , which implies that also here @xmath36 is a special point .",
    "we find next that for @xmath83 the mean particle density obeys @xmath277 i.e. contrary to the behavior of the mean particle density in the annealed disorder case , eq.([123 ] ) , @xmath278 tends towards a constant value @xmath279 , which depends on @xmath3 and coincides with the corresponding values @xmath280 and @xmath281 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "behavior of the mean density versus the chemical potential @xmath21 for the annealed and quenched disorder cases is presented in fig.3 .    finally , from eq.([densii ] )",
    "we find that the compressibility @xmath233 admits the following form : @xmath282 which expansion also holds in the asymptotic limit @xmath83 .",
    "to conclude , in this paper we have presented an exact solution of a random reaction / adsorption model , appropriate to the situations with the catalytically - activated reactions on polymer chains containing randomly placed catalytist .",
    "more specifically , we have considered here the @xmath0 reaction on a one - dimensional regular lattice which is brought in contact with a reservoir of @xmath4 partilces .",
    "some portion of the intersite intervals on the regular lattice was supposed to possess special `` catalytic '' properties such that they induce an immediate reaction @xmath0 , as soon as two @xmath4 particles land onto two vacant sites at the extremities of the catalytic segment , or an @xmath4 particle lands onto a vacant site while the site at the other extremity of the catalytic segment is already occupied by another @xmath4 particle . for two different cases ; namely , when disorder in placement of the catalytic segments can be viewed as @xmath8 , and a more complex situation with a @xmath9 random distribution of the catalytic segments , we have determined exactly the disorder - averaged pressure per site . for the annealed disorder case such",
    "a pressure has been found in a closed form and explicit asymptotic expansions in powers of the activity for the mean particle density and the compressibility have been obtained . in the case of @xmath9 disorder",
    "we have shown that the thermodynamic limit result for the disorder - averaged pressure per site can be obtained very directly by noticing a similarity between the expressions defining the pressure in the model under study and the lyapunov exponent of a product of random two - by - two matrices , obtained by derrida and hilhorst @xcite .",
    "we have also derived an explicit expression obeyed by the averaged logarithm of the partition function , which is valid for any chain s length @xmath1 . from this expression",
    "we have constructed the large-@xmath1 expansion and have shown , in particular , that the first correction to the thermodynamic limit result for the disorder - averaged pressure per site is proportional to the first negative power of @xmath1 .",
    "the leading term in this expansion coincides with the one found from the analysis by derrida and hilhorst .",
    "explicit asymptotic expansions for the mean particle density and the compressibility were also derived .",
    "we have demonstrated that for low activities in the annealed and quenched disorder cases the coefficients in the corresponding expansions of the pertinent parameters in the taylor series in powers of @xmath19 coincide up to the order @xmath283 and slightly deviate from each other starting from the fourth order . on the other hand ,",
    "expansions in inverse powers of @xmath19 ( large-@xmath19 behavior ) are different already in the leading order .",
    "most spectacular difference between the annealed and quenched disorder case have been observed in the behavior of the compressibility : in the annealed disorder case it appears to be a non - monotoneous function of the mean density @xmath3 of the catalytic segments , while in the quenched disorder case it is a monotoneously increasing function of @xmath3 .",
