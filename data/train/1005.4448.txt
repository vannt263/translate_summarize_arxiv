    "the realization that entanglement is a resource for a number of useful tasks in quantum information has led to a tremendous interest in its properties , quantification and in methods by which it can be produced .",
    "one area , which has been fruitful , is the study of entanglement in many - body systems ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "spin systems , in particular , have received a great deal of attention , and this has led to the formulation of several conditions for determining whether the state of a spin system is entangled .",
    "for example , in an @xmath0 qubit system , with @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 being the pauli matrices for the @xmath4 qubit , the state is entangled if @xcite @xmath5 if this inequality is satisfied , the n - qubit state can not be expressed as @xmath6 where the @xmath7 sum to one , and @xmath8 is a density matrix for the @xmath4 qubit . a state that can be expressed in this form",
    "is known as completely separable .",
    "further criteria for entanglement in spin systems have been developed @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study of entanglement conditions employing quantities that are at most quadratic in the collective spin operators has been given in @xcite .",
    "recently two inequalities have been developed for the detection of entanglement @xcite .",
    "consider a system consisting of two subsystems , which we shall denote by @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the hilbert space for the total system is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the hilbert space for subsystem @xmath9 and @xmath13 is the hilbert space for subsystem @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath14 be an operator on @xmath12 and @xmath15 be an operator on @xmath13 .",
    "the state of the total system is entangled if either @xmath16 ) holds if the left - hand side is replaced by @xmath17 . in the following",
    "we shall use the form ( [ entcongen1 ] ) or @xmath18 interchangeably .",
    "these are sufficient conditions for entanglement ; if they are not satisfied we can not say whether the state is entangled or not .",
    "some of the implications of these conditions have been explored for the case that the systems are field modes @xcite , and in the case that one is a field mode and one is a collection of atoms @xcite . here we would like to explore their implications for spin systems . in that case , we have a collections of spins , and our subsystems are two non - overlapping subsets of the total set .",
    "we describe each subset by a collective spin , @xmath19 for set @xmath9 and @xmath20 for set @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the angular momentum lowering operator for set @xmath9 and @xmath22 be the angular momentum lowering operator for set @xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding raising operators are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "our entanglement conditions become @xmath25 ) could be of use .",
    "however , one might instead wish to find out whether two blocks of spins are entangled , in which case the above equations , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being collective spin operators for the respective blocks , could be useful .",
    "as was mentioned previously , a large amount of work has been done on entanglement in spin systems , in particular spin chains with different types of interactions between adjacent spins . typically the concurrence of two spins in the ground state of the system is found .",
    "this has been done for many variants of the heisenberg model , both with and without an applied magnetic field .",
    "we will be interested in applying our conditions to a spin system at finite temperature , in particular one with a ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction .",
    "wang and zanardi showed that in a one - dimensional ring with periodic boundary conditions , and the spins interacting via an isotropic heisenberg interaction , there is no entanglement between any two spins at any temperature @xcite .",
    "this result depends on the @xmath28 symmetry of the hamiltonian , and does not appy if there is an applied magnetic field .",
    "asoudeh and karimipour look at the case in which there is an applied magnetic field and only the ground state and the state with one flipped spin are populated , and found the concurrence between two spins as a function of their separation @xcite .",
    "the advantage of applying the entanglement conditions in the previous paragraph is that we can study the entanglement between blocks of spins , and not just the entanglement between individual spins .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we will initially study some general properties of our entanglement conditions .",
    "we will first compare the application of our conditions to individual and collective spins .",
    "it will be shown that the conditions can detect entanglement between spins in angular momentum intelligent states .",
    "these are states for which the uncertainty relations for angular momentum operators are satisfied as an equality .",
    "we will then show how the above conditions can be strengthened by imposing local rotational invariance .",
    "next , we will move on to spin systems , and use the above conditions to study entanglement in spin wave states , first for states containing a small number of spin waves , and then for states at finite temperature .",
    "one of the advantages of the entanglement conditions in the introduction is that they allow us to look at the entanglement between blocks of spins rather than between individual spins .",
    "a standard approach when studying the entanglement in spin-1/2 systems is to choose two spins and calculate their concurrence .",
    "it is , however , quite possible that there is no entanglement between individual spins , but there is between blocks of spins . in that case , the method based on concurrence will fail .",
    "this can be illustrated by an example .",
    "let us consider four qubits , i.e. spin-1/2 particles , with qubits @xmath29 and @xmath30 in block @xmath9 , and qubits @xmath31 and @xmath32 in block @xmath10 .",
    "each qubit has an orthonormal basis @xmath33 , and a raising operator @xmath34 and a lowering operator @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "let us now consider the four - qubit state latexmath:[\\[|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } |00\\rangle_{12}|00\\rangle_{34 } + \\frac{1}{2 } ( |01\\rangle_{12 }    qubits @xmath30 and @xmath32 we find the reduced density matrix for qubits @xmath29 and @xmath31 @xmath40 which is separable .",
    "so , if we just look at qubits @xmath29 and @xmath31 , i.e. one qubit in each block , we do not see any entanglement .",
    "however , setting @xmath41 we find that @xmath42 so that the second entanglement condition in eq .",
    "( [ entcond ] ) is satisfied .",
    "therefore , by looking at entanglement between blocks , we see that the state is , in fact , entangled .",
    "we first will proceed to examine two more complicated types of entangled states in order to see whether our entanglement conditions can show that these states are indeed entangled . in the first case",
    ", we will apply the conditions to both individual and collective spins in order to see which method yields a more sensitive test of entanglement .",
    "suppose we have @xmath43 qubits .",
    "we will divide the qubits into two blocks of @xmath44 qubits each , and within each block , we will consider only those states of total spin @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , we want to examine states of the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{states1 }    with @xmath45 , and the state with subscript @xmath9 referring to the first block and the state with subscript @xmath10 referring to the second .",
    "this is clearly an entangled state , and we want to see whether the entanglement conditions we have proposed will detect the entanglement .",
    "we will do this in two different ways .",
    "first , we will apply the second entanglement condition in eq .",
    "( [ entcond ] ) to the collective spin of each block .",
    "next , we will choose one qubit from each block and apply the same condition to those two qubits .",
    "the calculations for the condition using the collective spins is straightforward , and we find @xmath47 therefore , the second entanglement condition in eq .",
    "( [ entcond ] ) becomes @xmath48 one possible choice of @xmath49 is to set @xmath50 , for some @xmath51 and @xmath52 an appropriate normalization constant .",
    "this gives us @xmath53 this condition is clearly satisfied when @xmath54 , but not satisfied for @xmath55 .",
    "now let us see what happens if we just look at one qubit in each block .",
    "let the qubit in the first block be qubit @xmath29 and the one in the second block be qubit @xmath30 , and we will assume that each of these qubits is the first one in its respective block . let us call the spin - down state of an individual qubit @xmath56 and the spin - up state @xmath57 .",
    "the basis states for each block are @xmath44-fold tensor products of spin - up and spin - down states for each qubit in the block .",
    "the state @xmath58 of @xmath44 qubits with @xmath45 is the symmetric linear combination of all basis states in which there are @xmath59 ones and @xmath60 zeroes .",
    "there are @xmath61 such states .",
    "the operator @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the raising and lowering operators for qubit @xmath29 , is just the projection onto states in which the state of the first qubit is @xmath57 .",
    "there are @xmath65 states , and this implies that @xmath66 this implies that @xmath67 the expression for @xmath68 is identical .",
    "we now want to compute @xmath69 .",
    "the operator @xmath70 will pick out the basis states with ones in the first slot of each block . by reasoning similar to that",
    "above , we have that @xmath71 this gives us that @xmath72 finally , the second entanglement condition in eq .",

    "this implies that at least for states of the type in eq .",
    "( [ states1 ] ) , the collective spin condition is stronger , that is , it will be satisfied by more states , than the condition for individual spins .",
    "we first want to find some spin states that satisfy our entanglement conditions .",
    "one possibility is to find states in which the spins of the two subsystems are highly correlated , and states in which the uncertainty of the sum ( or difference ) of the two spins is small will satisfy this condition .    let us begin by looking at the uncertainty relation for the total spin , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are the components of @xmath19 , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the components of @xmath20 .",

    "we note that what the local rotation on subsystem @xmath9 does is to send both @xmath23 and @xmath21 into linear combinations of @xmath23 , @xmath21 , and @xmath81 .",

    "@xmath256 is found to be negative and the overall range over which @xmath256 is found to be positive increases .     as a function of the interatomic distance , scaled by the lattice constant .",
    "a positive @xmath256 indicates entanglement .",
    "some large ( positive ) values of @xmath256 are beyond the scope of the figure .",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath260 . ]     as a function of the temperature for different inter - particle distances @xmath261 ( a ) 1 ( solid line ) , ( b ) 3 ( dashed line ) , ( c ) 10 ( dotted line ) , ( d ) 20 ( dot - dashed line ) . ]    the temperature dependence of @xmath256 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ temp ] for different values of the inter - particle distance .",
    "it can be seen that as the temperature increases , @xmath256 monotonically decreases , and the shorter the interparticle distance , the later @xmath256 crosses into the negative range .",
    "in other words , as we would expect on physical grounds , lower temperatures and shorter inter - particle distances are more favorable for entanglement generation , and this parameter region is where our condition shows the presence of entanglement . if we assume some typical parameters for ferromagnets @xcite @xmath262 and @xmath263 , using @xmath264 , the temperatures at which @xmath256 turns negative , which is where entanglement is no longer detected , are 420k , 150k , 20k , and 8k for @xmath261 1 ( solid line ) , 3 ( dashed line ) , 10 ( dotted line ) , and 20 ( dot - dashed line ) , respectively .",
    "thus when the atoms are closer located , entanglement can be detected at higher temperatures .",
    "we are , of course , assuming that these temperatures are still considerably below the critical temperature , so that the spin - wave description remains valid .",
    "let us now proceed to use the condition ( [ entcongen1 ] ) to investigate entanglement between blocks of @xmath170 spins each , one beginning at spin 1 and the other beginning at spin @xmath191 . with @xmath14 and @xmath15 chosen as in eqs .",

    "@xmath226 ( the term in the curly brackets ) consists of two parts , the first representing the correlations between spins within a block and the second representing the correlations between blocks .",
    "equation ( [ f22 ] ) is general in that the atoms can be arranged in an arbitrary manner in space .",
    "the only assumption used is that the two blocks do not overlap . as in the case of individual spins , in the high temperature limit @xmath269 , @xmath270 , indicating explicitly that the inequality ( [ f22 ] ) can not be satisfied . at low temperatures , whether @xmath256 is positive or negative depends on the details of the terms in the sums over @xmath266 .     as a function of the block size @xmath170  the number of spins in each block for a fixed dimensionless temperature @xmath260 and for @xmath271 .",
    "the inset zooms in the part of the plot for small @xmath170 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ block ] we plotted @xmath256 as a function of the block size @xmath170 , @xmath170 being the number of spins contained in each block .",
    "it is assumed that each block consists of neighboring spins located along a straight line , one beginning at spin 1 and the other beginning at spin @xmath191 so that the blocks are separated by @xmath192 spins . for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ block ] , the case of individual spins @xmath201 exhibits no entanglement ( cf .",
    "[ dx ] ) . as the size of the blocks @xmath170 increases ( fig .",
    "[ block ] , inset ) , @xmath256 acquires positive values indicating a presence of inter - block entanglement .",
    "the change is not monotonic , however .",
    "as @xmath170 increases further , the entanglement detected by our condition can disappear and reappear , being particularly strong for @xmath272 .",
    "the sign of @xmath256 obviously depends on whether the @xmath266 add constructively or destructively .",
    "an examination of inter - block entanglement may thus offer much richer physics than simply a study of the entanglement between individual spins .",
    "we have presented two entanglement conditions for spin systems that allow us to study the entanglement between blocks of spins .",
    "most tests for entanglement in spin systems test for either complete separability or for entanglement between individual spins , and the results in this paper complement those .",
    "we have shown that in some cases the conditions involving blocks of spins can detect entanglement when tests of individual spins can not .",
    "it was shown that our entanglement conditions can detect entanglement in intelligent spin states and in states of a spin chain containing a small number of spin waves .",
    "this latter result was then extended to show that entanglement in spin waves at finite temperature can also be detected .",
