    "the astra ( astrometric and phase - referencing astronomy ) upgrade program , funded by the nsf major research instrumentation program , aims at extending the sensitivity and spectral resolution of the keck interferometer ( ki ) through phase referencing and to implement a narrow - angle astrometry mode to enable a much broader scientific use of the ki . in this paper",

    "therefore , it is possible in spr to increase the spectral resolution of the interferometric measurement by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "spr as currently implemented and provided to the general user , offers a spectral resolution @xmath9 of 2000 , which is nyquist sampled at r = 1000 ( 330 pixels across the k-band ) at k @xmath10 .",
    "further technical aspects and results from the commissioning are discussed by @xcite . besides simple amplitude spectro - interferometry at this resolution ,",

    "in addition , several young stellar objects were observed successfully @xcite .",
    "we show at the example of 48  lib the wealth of spatial and spectral information that can be provided by spr data .",
    "48  lib is a well studied classical be - star with circumstellar shell - emission lines .",
    "previous optical - nearinfrared long - baseline interferometric ( olbi ) measurements of be - star - shells demonstrated that 3d - models for h - line and continuum emission often overpredict the true size , which demonstrates the need for direct olbi measurements .",
    "narrow - band observations with the mark iii interferometer , resulted in be - star disk diameter estimates ranging in 2.6 to 4.5 mas @xcite , well suited for the angular resolution of the 85 m baseline of the ki ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we chose 48  lib as science demonstration target because recent detection of very narrow satellite absorption features in fe  ii shell lines reliably indicate very high inclination angles .",
    "this ensures strong features in the differential visibility and phase signals across the emission lines .    a large fraction of",
    "be stars show cyclic variations in the ratio between the violet and red flux of the hi emission lines ( v / r ) , an enigmatic phenomenon studied since almost a century @xcite . early measurements with the gi2 t interferometer spatially and timely resolved the @xmath12 emission of @xmath13-cas , showing spatial variation of the line emission region with time @xcite .",
    "the fast rotation of be - stars ( near - critical rotational velocities for cooler stars like 48  lib , * ? ? ? * ) results in a flattening of the stellar shape , which can be observationally confirmed by olbi . while the rapid rotation might play a role in the ejection of the circumstellar envelope , the quadrupole moment of the gravitational potential of a flattened be star",
    "is expected to create a prograde one - armed spiral density pattern , slowly precessing in the disk and creating the v / r cycles .",
    "the latter authors calculate that the radial extension of such a disk oscillation mode should be confined to a few stellar radii , which can be probed by interferometry .",
    "central properties of this theory have been observed indirectly by the continuous observation of individual line profiles , and the detection of phase - shifts between different emission line cycles pointing towards a spiral density perturbation @xcite .",
    "spectro - interferometric observations of the photocenter shift in hydrogen lines of @xmath14  tau appear to directly confirm a one - armed density mode in the disk .    after summarizing the observation and data reduction ( sect .",

    "note for @xmath6 , that the offset between zero @xmath25 and rest wavelength is significantly larger than the accuracy of our wavelength calibration .",

    "the slightly red slope of the linear flux ratio continuum probably originates in the shell - induced nir excess of 48  lib , which photosphere is hotter than the calibrator of spectral type a4v .",

    "the typically found moderate extent of the @xmath15-band emission size ( 5 - 10 times the stellar radius ) is significantly smaller than recently modeled , confirming the need for interferometric constraints to understand the physical conditions in the stellar outflows of be - stars .",

    "furthermore , the @xmath55 line center in total and correlated flux drops below the continuum level ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",

    "the disk of 48  lib is known to be edge on , which simplifies the geometric and kinematic interpretation of the line profiles . the spectrometer does not fully nyquist - sample the double peak of the @xmath6 and pfund lines , but the central dip in the flux and the shape of the @xmath25  signal show that the violet ( v ) and red ( r ) part of the disk are clearly separated by the spectrometer , and that meaningful v / r ratios can be derived .",

    "this avoids that the final average profile ( @xmath55 ) is affected by the individual line fluxes .",
    "we checked that none of the features of @xmath55 discussed below is significantly altered or vanishes when averaging over all 11 detected pfund lines .",
    "however , our choice of averaging over the five strongest lines to create @xmath55 leads to the highest snr .",
    "in addition , the omitted higher - order pfund lines are closer in rest wavelength , and therefore , overlapping of adjacent line profiles would become apparent and compromise the profile of @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , at velocities @xmath75@xmath26 ( indicated by the dashed region in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) , the average profile is affected by adjacent lines .",
    "we purposefully show in the figure a large velocity space including these artifacts to demonstrate that @xmath55 emerges even out of these averaging artifacts .",
    "unless indicated otherwise , we use a linear flux ratio continuum fit . using a black body instead of a linear shape for the flux ratio continuum",
    "leads to a comparably good fit , and slightly increases the off - center line emission of @xmath55 .",

    "the statistical precision of the averaged profiles are shown as red errorbars .",
    "we compared the individual properties ( flux , visibility , and differential phase ) of the @xmath72(24 .. 28 ) included in @xmath55 to check if meaningful geometric constraints on the pfund line emission zone can be derived from @xmath55 .",
    "the decreasing signature in visibility and phase with increasing excitation level is consistent with the @xmath7-n/@xmath7224 line flux ratios .",
    "this means that a similar geometry is encoded in the measured visibility and phase of each line , suggesting a common origin of the lines , and justifying the averaging .",
    "the individual line ratios used match the respective pfund - line ratio trends measured for other be - star envelopes , such as and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these flux ratios vary by no more than up to about 30  % ( @xmath7 - 28/@xmath7224 ) , which indicates together with a similarly moderate variation of the respective einstein coefficients that the lines included in @xmath55 are emitted under similar conditions .",
    "therefore , they most likely originate from similar regions in the disk .",
    "the geometric constraints , derived from @xmath55 , can not be more accurate than this level , which matches the numbers , given in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the precision of the @xmath76-estimate of the individual pfund lines is clearly limited by our spectral resolution and the sampling of the line profile .",
    "apparent ratios of up to 20  % above and below unity for the pfund lines included in @xmath55 are regarded as not significantly different from unity .",
    "therefore , the lines show comparable @xmath76 .",
    "given the previous arguments for a common origin of the individual lines in the disk , we can expected that averaging does improve the @xmath76-signal for the pfund emission zone .",
    "we concentrate on answering the key question qualitatively : are ki - spr data suitable to measure directly , and efficiently in a single dataset , core parameters like radial extent and radius - dependence of the often discussed slowly rotating density inhomogeneity in the gas around be stars ?",
    "to do so , violet and red velocity bins outside of the line center were defined to derive average v - r properties of the lines , while avoiding the zone of highest absorption and uncertain continuum ( see below ) .",

    "another indication for the different location of the pfund line emission are the total and correlated flux profiles .",
    "both show a clear absorption below the continuum emission level .",
    "this , together with the symmetric line profile might indicate that the gas dominating the pfund emission is located _ in front _ of the inner disk and the star ( responsible for the continuum ) .",
    "as discussed , we can not estimate what fraction of this continuum absorption is due to intrinsic photospheric absorption . but a domination of the measured continuum absorption by photospheric absorption is unlikely for a be star . having the majority of the @xmath6 emission at larger stellocentric radii on the violet side , but the pfund emission at smaller radii in front of the star suggests that the over - density pattern follows a radial , one - armed spiral pattern .",

    "[ fig:4 ] . however , our single dataset obviously can not distingiush a spiral wave from other radius - dependent perturbations patterns .",
    "our data provide a further quantitative test of papaloizou s density wave model .",
    "discuss that the temporal prediction of v / r cycles of about 10  yr periods fits the available spectroscopic observations .",
    "interferometric observations directly resolve the expected linear scale of the predicted density waves , as opposed to indirect methods such as polarimetry ( as discussed for instance in * ? ? ?",
    "the mean photocenter shifts result in stellocentric radii of about 18  ( 8)  @xmath88 for @xmath6 ( @xmath55 ) , which is consistent with both hydrogen emission line modeling of be stars and with density wave models predicting that the local density perturbation , induced by the rotational flattening of the be stars , disappears outside a few stellar radii .",
    "we presented the first interferometric detection of several pfund lines at the red end of the @xmath0-band .",
    "thanks to the simultaneous detection of @xmath6 in the spectrum of a single ki - spr observation , we can derive stello - centric radius dependent properties the gas disk of the classical be - star 48  lib at high precision .",
    "the geometry and kinematics of the emission zones of @xmath6 and of eleven higher pfund lines are clearly detected in the differential visibility and phase signals , and the pfund emission originates from smaller stello - centric radii than @xmath6 .",
    "the radial separation of the various emission lines is convincingly explained by the physics of optically thick line emission in the be circumstellar disks .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0-band disk continuum emission was resolved as well , and shown to be emitted from inside the @xmath6 ( v / r @xmath89 ) hydrogen line zone , at radii comparable to the bulk of the @xmath7-emission ( with v / r @xmath90 ) .",
    "our findings match qualitatively and quantitatively theoretical be - star disk model calculations , predicting a precessing one - armed over - density pattern .",
    "the spatial constraints from our interferometric data coincide with the common notion that be - star disks have a keplerian - like radial velocity profile .",
    "observations similar to the here presented will shed more light on the enigmas of the creation and properties of circumstellar be shells at all stages of evolution .",
    "in particular time - resolved monitoring of be circumstellar environments with ki - spr together with radiative transfer modeling of the disk emission will deliver strong constraints on the actual radial and azimuthal geometry of the disk inhomogeneities likely to be responsible for the hi line emission asymmetries .",
    "in addition to the presented scientific results on the disk of 48  lib , we demonstrate with the detection of the pfund lines , that even weak line emission can produce a significant signal in the differential phase .",
    "ki - spr data of bright stars can be calibrated to a differential precision of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this extreme precision in the differential phase equals an on - sky centroid shift of 3  @xmath4as ( a relative precision of 10@xmath91 ) , which is an improvement by two orders of magnitude over state - of - the - art single - telescope spectro - astrometry .",
    "this improvement is however limited to the relatively small interferometric field of view ( @xmath8130 mas ) and sensitivity of the current ki - spr mode .",
    "dual field phase referencing , the second phase of the ki - astra upgrade , is currently under construction , and will allow fainter science targets to be observed . using a different dispersive element ,",
    "even higher spectral resolution could be achieved in spr mode .",
    "we are grateful to w. vacca and a. seifahrt for many useful discussions and contributions to this work .",
    "the excellent support of the ki team at wmko and nexsci helped making these observations a success .",
    "the realization of the ki - astra upgrade is supported by the nsf mri grant , ast-0619965 .",
    "the data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",

    "<S> we report on the successful science verification phase of a new observing mode at the keck interferometer , which provides a line - spread function width and sampling of 150  km / s at @xmath0-band , at a current limiting magnitude of @xmath1  mag with spatial resolution of @xmath2 and a measured differential phase stability of unprecedented precision ( 3  mrad at @xmath3 , which represents 3  @xmath4as on sky or a centroiding precision of @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scientific potential of this mode is demonstrated by the presented observations of the circumstellar disk of the evolved be - star 48  lib . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to indirect methods such as multi - wavelength spectroscopy and polaritmetry , the here described spectro - interferometric astrometry provides a new tool to directly constrain the radial density structure in the disk . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve for the first time several pfund emission lines , in addition to @xmath6 , in a single interferometric spectrum , and with adequate spatial and spectral resolution and precision to analyze the radial disk structure in 48  lib . </S>",
    "<S> the data suggest that the continuum and @xmath7-emission originates in significantly more compact regions , inside of the @xmath6 emission zone . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spectro - interferometric astrometry opens the opportunity to directly connect the different observed line profiles of @xmath6 and pfund in the total and correlated flux to different disk radii . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational potential of a rotationally flattened be star is expected to induce a one - armed density perturbation in the circumstellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> such a slowly rotating disk oscillation has been used to explain the well known periodic v / r spectral profile variability in these stars , as well as the observed v / r cycle phase shifts between different disk emission lines . the differential line properties and linear constraints set by our data are consistent with theoretical models and lend direct support to the existence of a radius - dependent disk density perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the data also shows decreasing gas rotation velocities at increasing stello - centric radii as expected for keplerian disk rotation , assumed by those models . </S>"
