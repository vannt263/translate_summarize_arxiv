    "low - mass stellar members ( m @xmath4 1.2m@xmath5 ) of young open clusters and stellar association ( age @xmath4 0.5gyr ) exhibit a wide spread of their rotation periods . within each cluster / association",
    ", we note that stars with similar masses have their rotation periods within a range of values .",
    "this range is minimum at early spectral types ( from mid- to late - f ) and , generally , it increases when we move towards lower mass stars ( see , e.g. , mamajek & hillenbrand 2008 ) .",
    "this spread of rotation periods at the same stellar mass arises likely from differences in the initial rotation periods and in the primordial disc lifetimes .",
    "the shorter the disc lifetime , the shorter the disc - locking time , and the earlier the star begins to spinning up , owing to radius contraction ( see , e.g. , camenzind 1990 ; ribas et al .",
    "+ we are carrying out a study to investigate if gravitational effects can shorten the disc lifetime by comparing the rotation periods of close components of multiple systems with those of single stars .",
    "this study is part of the race - oc project ( rotation and activity evolution in open clusters ; messina 2007 ) . for this study , cluster or association",
    "stars that belong to triple or multiple systems are the best suited , especially if the components of these systems have similar masses .",
    "the origin of significantly different rotation periods among the components can reside in different initial rotation periods and/or in a different duration of the disc lifetimes , being similar all the other basic parameters ( age , mass , metallicity ) .",
    "the architecture of the system , that is the reciprocal distance among the components , in these cases can play its own key role in differentiating the rotation periods .",
    "we have already analysed two such triple systems , bd@xmath6211074 in the @xmath1 pictoris association ( messina et al .",
    "2014 ) , and tyc9300 - 0891 - 1ab / tyc9300 - 0525 - 1 in the octans association ( messina et al .",
    "2016a ) . in both systems",
    ", there are two components on a wide orbit , and one having a nearby companion . in the first system ( bd@xmath6211074 )",
    ", we found that the nearby companion at 16au significantly shortened the disc lifetime making one component to rotate significantly faster than the wide companion . in the second case ( tyc9300 - 0891 - 1ab / tyc9300 - 0525 - 1 )",
    ", we found that the nearby companion at 160au was sufficiently distant to have a negligible effect on the rotation , given that there was no period difference between the tight binary and the wide companion .",
    "+ now , we present a third system , at mic ab + au mic in the 25@xmath03-myr @xmath1 pictoris association ( messina et al .",
    "2016b ) . at mic and au mic",
    "are at very large distance ( @xmath246200 au ) from each other , whereas at mic a and b are separated by only @xmath227au .",
    "we measured the photometric rotation periods of both components a and b. as we will show , au mic has a rotation period comparable to those of other single stars and very wide components of binary systems , therefore we can assume that it has evolved as a single star with negligible external gravitational perturbation . on the contrary , the close components of at mic with their rotation periods a factor 5 shorter than au mic , have likely reciprocally shortened their disc lifetime and started to spin up earlier than the coeval au mic .",
    "+ we also find that the difference between the rotation periods of the a and b components of at mic is significant , and explore the role that the flaring activity on one or both components may have played to produce such period difference .",
    "+ in sect.2 , we present the literature information on au mic and at mic . in sect.3 and 4",
    ", we present the photometric data and their periodogram analyses to measure the rotation periods of the at mic components . in sect.5",
    ", we present our novel analysis on the flares detected on at mic .",
    "a discussion of the rotational properties of the components of the triple system is given in sect.6 .",
    "conclusions are presented in sect.7 .",
    "au mic is a m1ve single star ( matthews et al . 2015 ; bailey et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it hosts a well - known debris disk that appears nearly edge - on and extends out to @xmath2200au in radius ( kalas et al .",
    "the rotation period p = 4.865d was discovered by torres & ferraz - mello ( 1973 ) .",
    "a new determination p = 4.854d was done by vogt et al .",
    "a period p = 4.852d is reported by kiraga ( 2012 ) and p = 4.822d is listed in all sky catalogue of variable stars ( acvs ; pojmaski 2002 ) .",
    "a period p = 4.837d is found by hebb et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    at mic is a close visual binary consisting of two almost equal m4.5ve + m4.5ve components at a distance d = 10.70pc ( zuckerman & song 2004 ) .",
    "both stars show evidence for a significant orbital motion .",
    "wilson ( 1954 ) reports a separation @xmath7 = 3.6@xmath8 between the two components , mccarthy & white ( 2012 ) report @xmath7 = 3.3@xmath8 , whereas riedel et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found the separation to vary from @xmath7 = 2.8@xmath8 ( pa = 171@xmath9 ) in 2003 to @xmath7 = 2.3@xmath8 ( pa = 153@xmath9 ) in 2012 , the latter corresponding to a projected separation of @xmath227au , and provided a more precise distance measurement d = 9.87@xmath00.07pc .",
    "preliminary orbital period p = 209yr and eccentricity e = 0.26 are provided by malkov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . + the membership of the @xmath1 pictoris association",
    "was first proposed by barrado y navascus et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , subsequently confirmed by zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , lepine & simon ( 2009 ) , malo et al .",
    "( 2013 , 2014 ) , and riedel et al .",
    "+ shaya & olling ( 2011 ) using bayesian statistical methods found that at mic and au mic have very high ( 100% ) probability to be a physical pair , despite their large angular separation ( @xmath24680@xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore the close visual binary at mic together with au mic form a hierarchical triple system .",
    "the system has a reduced gravitational binding energy u@xmath10 ( caballero 2009 ) , where m@xmath11 is the mass of at mic , m@xmath12 the mass of au mic , @xmath13 is the universal gravitation constant , and @xmath14 the projected separation .",
    "this value lies at the boundary between very wide binaries and couples of single stars that are co - moving within the same stellar kinematic group ( see , alonso - floriano et al .",
    "2015 ; caballero 2010 ) .",
    "however , as caballero ( 2009 ) noted , this system is close to the bound limit and close to be disrupted by third bodies . + a number of projected rotational velocity measurements for au mic and for both the components of at mic are available in the literature and they are listed in table  [ tab_vsini ] .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ flaresdata ]    figure  [ primoflare ] shows , as an example , one of the observed flares .",
    "as mentioned , the analysed photometric time series shows the occurrence of 12 flares , some of them complete , other only partially recorded . to search for any preferred phase for flare occurrence along the star rotation , the subset of data acquired during flares",
    "have been folded in phase by using the two periods derived by the analysis of quiet - state data ( see sect.4 ) .",
    "data folded with p@xmath11 = 1.19d ( see left panel of fig.[flarep1 ] ) show a gap of flaring activity between phases 0.25 and 0.5 . instead , flaring data phased by using the period p@xmath12 = 0.78d do not show any particular concentration or gaps ( see right panel of fig.[flarep1 ] ) .    to check for a possible bias due to a not random distribution of the observed epochs in the full time series",
    ", we have binned the full data set and the selected flare data set , phase bins was 0.1 .",
    "the resulting histograms for flare data were normalised to the histogram obtained for the full data sets in order to remove any possible bias , and to the summation of all 10 densities per bin to normalise to 1 the integral .",
    "the histograms are showed in figure [ histoflares ] , where the solid line represents the flare data set folded by using period p@xmath15 as described and dashed line the same set similarly folded by using p@xmath16 .",
    "flares show a correlation with the light curve phased with the longer period ( the minimum flare frequency corresponds to the light curve minimum , when spots are best in view ) , the histogram folded with the shorter period does not show evidence of correlation instead . however , because of the small number of flare events considered in this analysis , the differences from bin to bin are not highly significant .",
    "therefore , we are not in the position to establish if both components or only one are responsible for the observed flares .",
    "the at mic ab + au mic triple system is key to investigate the origin of rotation period spread generally observed among coeval stars at young ages",
    ". + color - period diagrams of young clusters / associations display an upper bound in the distribution whose bluer - part ( consisting of stars , starting from the f spectral type , that first settle on the zams ) moves progressively toward longer rotation periods and with a decreasing dispersion as far as the stellar age increases . by an age of about 0.6gyr",
    ", f - g - k stars exhibit an almost one - to - one correspondence between rotation period and mass , as in the case of hyades ( delorme et al .",
    "2011 ) , praesepe ( douglas et al . 2014 ) and coma berenicis ( collier cameron et al . 2009 ) open clusters .",
    "such an univocal dependence is currently exploited for gyro - chronological estimate of stellar age ( see , e.g. , mamajek & hillenbrandt 2008 ) .",
    "+ within the same stellar cluster , the distribution of rotation periods depends on mass and , for any mass bin , it depends on the initial rotation period and on the angular momentum evolution that can vary from star to star .",
    "+ in our specific case , au mic has a rotation period p = 4.83d .",
    "in contrast , the components of at mic exhibit a much faster rotation with p@xmath11 = 1.19d and p@xmath12 = 0.78d .",
    "thus , au mic has a rotation period a factor 5 longer than the average period of the at mic components .",
    "moreover , the components of at mic , although equal in mass , age , and metallicity , have a significant difference between their rotation periods of about 40% .",
    "+ in fig.[distri ] , a comparison with the period distribution of bona fide members of the @xmath1 pictoris association shows that the difference between the rotational properties of au mic and at mic is partly due to their different masses ( m1v against m4.5v , respectively ) , since the rotation period distribution is mass dependent .",
    "however , we note that at mic a and b rotate still faster than equal - mass / color single stars or wide components of multiple systems .",
    "in fact , their rotation periods are outside the 3@xmath17 distribution marked by the dashed lines in fig.[distri ] and fall in the region of the color - period plane occupied by close binary stars ( messina et al . in preparation ) .",
    "+ we found that the gravitational forces between the two components of the at mic system are about a factor @xmath27.3@xmath3 more intense than those between au mic and at mic .",
    "therefore , there is the possibility that such intense gravitational forces between at mic a and b may have enhanced their primordial disc dispersal , shortening the lifetime and , consequently , the duration of the disk locking phase . on the contrary , the primordial disc of the distant au mic ( @xmath246200au ) , being subjected to a negligible external gravitational perturbation , has evolved with the typical time scale of 46 myr , but rarely longer than about 10 myr ( ribas et al .",
    "2014 ; ingleby et al .",
    "2014 ) , allowing the central star to start its rotation spin up later with respect to at mic .",
    "this possible scenario has been proposed for the triple bd@xmath6211074 , where a distance of about 16au between the components of the close binary in the system is enough to have significant gravitational effects ( messina et al .",
    "2014 ) , whereas in the triple tyc9300 - 0891 - 1ab / tyc9300 - 0525 - 1 , where the distance between the a and b components of tyc9300 - 0891 - 1ab is about @xmath2160au , the effects are negligible ( messina et al .",
    "also the @xmath240% difference between the rotation periods of the components a and b of at mic is very large , considering that they have all stellar parameters , age , mass , radius , metallicity about equal .",
    "such a difference may arise from different initial rotation periods .",
    "in fact , we see in fig.[distri ] that it is comparable to the 3@xmath17 dispersion observed among similar color single stars",
    ". however , another interesting possibility may reside in a different magnetic activity level of the two components .",
    "if one component has a flare activity significantly larger than the other component , then this may lead to a significantly larger loss of angular momentum due to either mass loss or magnetic braking . in this hypothesis",
    ", we expect the slower rotating component of at mic to be more active ( and with an higher rate of flaring ) than the faster rotating component of at mic .",
    "we have attempted to identify if this is the case by investigating on the rate of flare occurrence on the two components , but , as discussed in sect.6 , despite we find some evidence that flares are associated more with a component , the quality and amount of our data prevent us to consider these results robust enough .",
    "to address this interesting issue we need to get resolved time series photometry of both components to check which component is responsible for the flares .",
    "we have analysed the rotational properties of the triple stellar system au mic + at mic a&b in the young 25@xmath03-myr @xmath1 pictoris association .",
    "we have measured the photometric rotation periods p = 1.19d and p = 0.78d of the at mic components , although we could not establish to which components the periods refer .",
    "we find that au mic is sufficiently distant ( @xmath2 46200au ) from at mic to have evolved rotationally as a single star with a primordial disc life time typical of a m1v star .",
    "therefore , its rotation period p = 4.85d fits well into the distribution of rotation periods of single members of the @xmath1 pictoris association . on the contrary , for the a and b components of at mic we propose a scenario according to which they are sufficiently close ( @xmath227au ) to have gravitationally perturbed the respective primordial discs , enhancing their dispersion and , consequently , shortening both the disc life time and the star - disc locking duration . in this scenario , at mic",
    "a and b started to spin up , owing to radius contraction , at earlier epochs with respect to au mic , reaching a rotation rate about a factor 5 faster than au mic .",
    "+ interestingly , we find that the a and b components of at mic , although substantially equal ( same mass , age , metallicity ) , have a significant ( @xmath240% ) difference between their rotation periods . this difference may arise from different initial rotation periods",
    ". however , we also note that this system has a high rate of flaring , and we have some hints that only one component may be the flare star",
    ". if this hypothesis would be correct , then the different flaring activity may be the additional parameter responsible for the different rotational evolution of the two components .",
    "in fact , a prominent flare activity can enhance the mass loss rate and , consequently , the angular momentum loss , as well , it can significantly modify the topology of the external magnetic fields making more or less efficient the stellar magnetic braking .",
    "certainly , spatially resolved photometry can allow us to see if one or both components have flares and to address this possible additional cause of the rotation period spread observed among the m - type stars . + _",
