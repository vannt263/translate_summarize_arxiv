    "the production mechanism of particles and nuclei is a fundamental and essential problem for the whole evolution of the universe . with the help of macroscopic and/or microscopic transport models for heavy ion collisions ( hics ) within a large range of beam energies from the gsi schwerionen synchrotron ( sis ) up to the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies ,",
    "the process of a complete compression and decompression from initial two colliding nuclei can be described dynamically , with the possible occurrence of ( phase ) transitions from nuclear liquid to gas ( lg ) or from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to hadron gas ( hg ) .",
    "such a model is , e.g. the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd)@xcite . after that , an afterburner is usually chosen for the freezeout of various particles ( free baryons , mesons , etc . ) or fragments ( deuterons , tritons , helium isotopes , etc . ) which can then be used for comparison with corresponding experimental data .",
    "it is unavoidable that the afterburner should be paid much more attention when a serious comparison between calculations and experiments is needed for extracting , although , mainly the information of the compression phase at the early stage .",
    "therefore , a large amount of such models are available but active in different beam energy regions ( with their own problems when describing data ) . at low bombarding energies from several tens to several hundreds mev@xmath1nucleon , the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite , the statistical evaporation model ( hivap ) @xcite and the statistical model ( gemini ) @xcite",
    "are frequently used ; at energies from several hundreds mev@xmath1nucleon to several gev@xmath1nucleon , the conventional phase - space coalescence model `` minimum spanning tree '' ( mst ) @xcite as well as the simulated annealing clusterisation algorithm ( saca ) @xcite are taken into account ; at higher energies , the coalescence afterburner using a wigner - function method @xcite is ordinarily in use .",
    "recently , the smm has been extended and successfully combined with the giessen boltzmann - uehling- uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) transport model in order to describe future experiments in hypernuclear physics at , e.g. the new gsi- and j - parc - facilities @xcite . however , the hyperfragments are still constructed within the phase space coalescence model .",
    "further , a so - called surface coalescence mechanism was introduced into qmd - like models such as the jaeri qmd ( jqmd ) @xcite and the improved quantum molecular dynamics ( imqmd ) @xcite in order for a better description on the experimental data of light complex particles ( lcp ) produced in nucleon - induced spallation reactions .",
    "quite recently , the traditional coalescence afterburner has been combined with a potential version of urqmd model to explain the production of free protons and @xmath0he clusters from hics at the brookhaven alternating gradient synchroton ( ags ) and the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) energies @xcite and it was found that , with only one parameter set of ( @xmath2,@xmath3)=(3.8 fm , 0.3 gev@xmath1c ) but using different stopping times for the former dynamic process , the rapidity distribution of both yields can be described reasonably well .",
    "hence , it seems that the traditional phase - space coalescence method can be widely used for ion collisions in a large range of beam energies despite of its simplicity and defects in other aspects such as the binding energy and the isospin . as a benchmark test",
    ", it is thus interesting to study the production of free protons and @xmath0he from hics with beam energies from several hundreds mev@xmath1nucleon to several tens gev@xmath1nucleon ( i.e. , within two - order - of - magnitude energies ) .",
    "further , due to the obvious kinetics / dynamics during collisions , there exists a strong correlation between coordinate and momentum spaces of particles , and this correlation is certainly time dependent as well .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to make a scan of the time evolution of the parameter set ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) in a reasonable range for the coalescence process to produce the same yield of a certain particle . based on these tests , the influence of coalescence parameters on observables related to protons and @xmath0he clusters other than their yields can then be observed .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the potential version of the urqmd and the choice of parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 used in the traditional coalescence model are introduced briefly . in sect.3 , the time evolution of free proton and @xmath0he yields from central hics at three beam - energy points lying in sis , ags , and sps regions , respectively ,",
    "are scanned and discussed .",
    "their rapidity distributions produced from semi - central hics are also investigated for understanding the influence of the afterburner on collective flows , such as the directed and elliptic ones , which are frequently used to extract comprehensive information on the ( isospin - dependent ) equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "finally , a summary and outlook is given in sect .",
    "the urqmd microscopic transport model was originally developed to study particle production at high energies such as ags , sps , and rhic energies @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been updated for simulating hics at both lower , such as sis energies @xcite and higher , such as lhc energies @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that the potentials always play an important role on the particle emission from hics at whatever low or high energies .",
    "the current potential version of the urqmd ( urqmd / m ) has considered mean - field potentials for both formed baryons and pre - formed hadrons in a similar way and expressed as@xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are parameters which determine the stiffness of the eos of nuclear matter ( in this work , the same soft eos with momentum dependence is adopted and the incompressibility @xmath10 mev ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the normal nuclear density and @xmath12 is the density for both pre - formed hadrons and formed baryons ( including anti - baryons ) . for formed mesons ,",
    "no nuclear potential is considered as before .",
    "certainly , the quark number difference between pre - formed baryons and mesons , and the relativistic effect on relative distances and momenta of two particles have been taken into account in the corresponding potential modification process .",
    "then , the required information of all particles is poured into the coalescence model for each 10 fm@xmath1c time step before the final stopping time @xmath13 fm@xmath1c .",
    "certainly , it is known that , with a large effort in constraining the stiffness of the eos of isospin symmetric nuclear matter @xcite , a soft eos with the incompressibility @xmath14 mev has been approved extensively @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , large uncertainties still exist in the isospin - dependent part of eos especially at supranormal densities @xcite . and",
    ", the main conclusions drawn in this paper will not be changed by the current choice of the stiffness of eos .    at each @xmath15 from 10 fm@xmath1c to 100 fm@xmath1c , the nucleons with relative momenta @xmath16 and relative distances @xmath17 will be considered to belong to one cluster .",
    "certainly , baryons other than nucleons can be treated in a similar way but not discussed in this work . as a matter of experience",
    ", the values for the parameter set ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) might be chosen in the range of ( 3 - 4 fm , 0.25 - 0.35 gev@xmath1c ) in order to describe experimental data from hics at sis , ags , and even sps energies .",
    "within such a large beam energy region , the relativistic effect on @xmath18 and @xmath19 between two baryons have been taken into account by the well - known lorentz transformation ( lt ) from the computational two - nucleus center - of - mass system to the local rest frame of two particles @xcite , and it is found that it has visible effect on light fragments , although not on free nucleons , which should be paid attention .    at the early stage of the reaction ,",
    "a large amount of constructed light clusters will be emitted pre - equilibrately , which should be constrained by existing experimental data . in this paper",
    "we select the data from three reactions : free protons from both ( i ) central ( with @xmath20 where @xmath21 the sum of the radii of the colliding nuclei ) au+au at @xmath22 gev@xmath1nucleon @xcite and ( ii ) central ( with @xmath23 where @xmath24 the total cross section ) au+au at @xmath25 gev@xmath1nucleon @xcite , and free protons and @xmath0he from ( iii ) central ( with @xmath23 ) pb+pb at @xmath26 gev@xmath1nucleon @xcite . in the reaction ( i ) , the total number of free protons is about @xmath27 in which a large error bar exists . in the reaction ( ii ) and",

    "[ fig1 ] depicts firstly the time evolution ( before 45 fm@xmath1c ) of reduced densities of all baryons ( @xmath35 ) in the central zone ( @xmath36 fm ) of the three reactions ( shown by different lines ) .",
    "the horizontal short - dashed line represents the normal density .",
    "it is seen obviously that the maximum central density is enhanced largely when the beam energy increases from sis to sps . at @xmath37 gev@xmath1nucleon ,",
    "it is less than 2 times of the normal density , while at @xmath38 gev@xmath1nucleon it becomes 5 times more than the normal density where the phase transition from qgp to hg might occurs .",
    "meanwhile , the time interval for persisting @xmath39 is shortened largely from about 25 fm@xmath1c to 9 fm@xmath1c with increasing beam energy .",
    "with such a large change in central densities , it is curious to see how it influences the production of particles and fragments in the end of evolution .",

    "it is clear that enough protons are produced only after 30 fm@xmath1c and excessive yields happen after 70 fm@xmath1c . during this time period",
    ", the accepted area demonstrates a strong reversed correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 which is easy to understand due to the strong coupling nature of the dynamic process .",
    "if the errors are smaller , the @xmath41 correlation will be more certain .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the correlation is time - dependent and the absolute value of the slope becomes larger with increasing time , which means that the proton production depends more heavily on the choice of @xmath2 than @xmath3 .",
    "it is due to the fact that the influence of both mean - field potentials and two - body collisions becomes weaker at later times and the change in the particle momentum is much less . in addition , it is nice to see that at the same time of 50 fm@xmath1c , the yields of protons at both bombarding energies can be described well with the coalescence model , although values of the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) set should be larger at the higher beam energy .",

    "it is also found that the accepted time period for describing data lies in 30 - 60 fm@xmath1c , and , the corresponding @xmath41 correlation is quite similar to that at @xmath25 gev@xmath1nucleon .",
    "all above results in the contour plots imply that the protons are produced at @xmath42 fm@xmath1c and weakly depend on the beam energy covering sis , ags , and sps .",

    "[ fig3 ] : before 50 fm@xmath1c , too many light clusters such as @xmath0he are produced but not stable and need time to decay .",

    "further , the strong @xmath41 correlation provides us with a series of parameter sets of ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) which helps us to check other observables which might be influenced by the final stage .    in the top two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we firstly present the rapidity distribution of proton yields ( using the left axis ) from both central ( @xmath23 , left plot ) and semi - central ( @xmath43 , right plot ) pb+pb reactions at 20 gev@xmath1nucleon . two sets of [ @xmath5 ) ] parameters are chosen to demonstrate the largest effect on the rapidity distribution , which are shown by solid and dashed lines .",
    "besides the total yield , the rapidity distribution of the proton yield has almost no difference for central collisions as seen in the top - left plot .",
    "while for non - central collisions shown in the top - right plot , this situation has changed to some extend outside of the mid - rapidity region @xmath44 .",
    "on the one side , the scanning work for values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 lying in the colorful regions of figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are useful since they are reliable in the description of proton data in total and in the mid - rapidity region . on the other side",
    ", the consistency check of the proton yields with the two different parameter sets guarantees the invariance of collective flow parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 at mid - rapidities . as an example , in the top - right plot and taking the right axis into use , the corresponding @xmath45 values are exhibited with dash - dotted and dotted lines .",
    "then , in the bottom plots of fig .  [ fig4 ] the rapidity distribution of @xmath0he yields from the same central ( left ) and semi - central ( right ) pb+pb reactions as that of protons are shown , but with different [ @xmath5 ) ] parameter sets ( shown by lines ) .",
