    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is a well  defined quantum theory of which the lagrangian form is completely known , including the general r  parity preserving , soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms .",
    "the full mssm largarangian has 124 parameters  79 real parameters and 45 cp  violating complex phases @xcite .",
    "the number of parameters in the mssm is very large compared to 19 in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , many studies @xcite on possible direct and indirect susy effects have been made by making several assumptions and investigating the variation of a few parameters .",
    "recently , it has , however , been shown @xcite that limits on sparticle masses and couplings are very sensitive to the assumptions and need to be re - evaluated without making any of the simplifying assumptions that have been standard up to now .    despite the large number of phases in the model as a whole , only two cp - odd rephase - invariant phases , stemming from the chargino and neutralino mass matrices , take part in the chargino and neutralino production processes @xcite . in light of this aspect , phenomenological analyses with the complex parameter set are not much more difficult than those with the real parameter set in the chargino or neutralino systems . incidentally ,",
    "the cp phases are constrained indirectly by the electron or neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) and may be small , but the indirect constraints @xcite on its actual size depends strongly on the assumptions taken in those analyses . as a matter of fact , many recent works @xcite have shown that the constraints could be evaded without suppressing the cp phases of the theory .",
    "one option @xcite is to make the first two generations of scalar fermions rather heavy so that one  loop edm constraints are automatically evaded .",
    "this case can be naturally explained by the so  called effective susy models @xcite where de  couplings of the first and second generation sfermions are invoked to solve the susy fcnc and cp problems without spoiling naturalness .",
    "another possibility is to arrange for partial cancellations among various contributions to the electron and neutron edm s . following the suggestions that the phases do not have to be suppressed ,",
    "many important works on the effects due to the cp phases have been already reported ; the effects are very significant in extracting the parameters in the susy lagrangian from experimental data @xcite , estimating dark matter densities and scattering cross sections @xcite and higgs boson mass limits @xcite , cp violation in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "if the scale of the susy breaking is around 1 tev as preferred by fine  tuning arguments in the higgs sector , many sparticles are expected to be produced at future colliders such as the fermilab tevatron upgrade , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , or future @xmath4 colliders proposed by desy , kek and slac . among the sparticles ,",
    "non  colored supersymmetric particles such as neutralinos , charginos and sleptons are relatively light in most superymmetry theories . with r  parity invariance , charginos and neutralinos , the mixtures of the gauginos and higgsinos , are produced pairwise in @xmath4 collisions , either in diagonal or in mixed pairs . at lep2 @xcite , and potentially even in the first phase of @xmath4 linear colliders ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the chargino @xmath5 and the neutralinos @xmath6 may be , for some time , the only chargino and neutralino states that can be studied experimentally in detail .",
    "furthermore , as they are expected to be lighter than the gluino and in most scenarios lighter than the squarks and sleptons , those lighter chargino and neutralino states could be first observed in future experiments at @xmath4 colliders . on the other hand , the heavier chargino and neutralino states may require the second - phase @xmath4 linear colliders with a c.m .",
    "energy of about 1.5 tev .    in light of the previous generic arguments and aspects concerning the sparticle spectrum ,",
    "one of the most promising susy processes for investigating a wide region of the susy parameter space is the associated production @xcite of neutralinos in @xmath4 collisions : @xmath7 .",
    "although in general chargino production @xcite is favored by larger cross sections , sizable cross sections for the neutralino process can be expected in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "moreover , it might be possible to discover susy by neutralino production if charginos are not accessible .",
    "if neutralinos as new particles are discovered , its clear identification can be enhanced by utilizing beam polarization and the complete investigation of the neutralino decays @xcite .",
    "polarized electron beams have been shown to play a critical role in disentangling susy parameters in chargino , neutralino and sfermion  pair productions in @xmath4 collisions . however , those works have mainly considered longitudinal electron polarization .",
    "recently , an intensive study to obtain high positron polarization has been made . in this light , we study the case where the polarization of both electron and positron beams can be freely manipulated , and we investigate if the highly polarized electron / positron beams can provide a powerful diagnostic tool for determining susy parameters in the associated neutralino  pair production .",
    "angular distributions and angular correlations of the decay products as well as neutralino decay widths and branching ratios can give valuable additional information on their composition from gaugino and higgsino components .",
    "certainly , one can infer the spin of the new particles from decay angular distributions with complete spin correlations of the decaying particle .",
    "moreover , the identification of neutralinos can be very much solidified by ascertaining the majorana character of the neutralinos @xcite .",
    "this has been demonstrated to be possible by means of the energy distributions of the decay leptons if the neutralinos are produced in collisions of polarized @xmath4 beams .",
    "the angular distributions of the decay products might , however , offer the possibility to prove the majorana property although polarized beams are not available .",
    "furthermore , the angular distributions of the final leptons are suitable observables for studying cp violation in the mssm @xcite .",
    "after the mixed pair @xmath8 and @xmath9 is produced , the second lightest neutralino @xmath9 decays to the lsp and two fermions .",
    "since leptons among fermions are most cleanly identified at high  performance detectors , one of the most promising modes for the associated production and sequential decays of neutralinos will be    ( 300,30)(0,0 ) ( 130,25)[]@xmath0 ( 155,15)(155,5 ) ( 155,6)[l]@xmath10 .",
    "so , in the present note we give a comprehensive analysis through initial beam polarizations and spin correlations between production and decay to investigate the effects of the cp phases and the other susy parameters in the associated production and decay of the neutralinos in the mssm with general cp phases but without generational mixing . in doing the analysis , it will be meaningful to include the stringent constraints from the electron edm measurements on the cp phases instead of performing full scans over the phases and real susy parameters , we take two typical scenarios to suppress the electron edm constraints or to allow a large space of the cp phases while satisfying the electron edm constraints .",
    "the choice of two scenarios will be made after a global study of the dependence of the electron edm on the relevant parameters in the mssm . in each scenario , the neutralino mass spectrum , three cp  even and one cp ",
    "odd observables using initial beam polarizations , the neutralino polarization vector and several distributions observable in the laboratory frame are presented and discussed .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "in section ii we describe the supersymmetric flavor  preserving mixing phenomena in a general parameterization scheme without generation mixing ; selectron left ",
    "right mixing , chargino mixing and neutralino mixing , and identify the relevant cp phases .",
    "section iii is devoted to the discussion of the constraints by the electron edm on the cp phases and section iv to the associated production of neutralinos with polarized beams and the introduction of useful cp  even and cp  odd observables , which are extracted by controlling the initial beam polarization . in section",
    "v we describe in detail the possible decay modes and branching ratios of the second  lightest neutralino . in section",
    "vi , we explain how to obtain the fully spin  correlated distributions of the associated production and decays of the neutralinos and study the impact of the cp phases on various angular correlations .",
    "conclusions are given in section vii .",
    "if flavor mixing among sleptons is neglected , the mass matrix of selectrons is given by @xmath11 the first term of the diagonal elements is the soft scalar mass term evaluated at the weak scale , and the second is the mass squared of the the corresponding electron ( dictated by susy ) , and the last comes from the @xmath12 term . the trilinear term @xmath13 causing left ",
    "right mixing is due to the soft  breaking yukawa ",

    "we parameterize @xmath17 so that @xmath19 where @xmath20 and we choose the range of @xmath21 and @xmath22 so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in supersymmetric theories , the spin1/2 partners of the @xmath25 bosons and the charged higgs bosons , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , mix to form chargino mass eigenstates @xmath28 .",

    "since the chargino mass matrix @xmath32 is not symmetric , two different unitary matrices acting on the left and right chiral @xmath33 states are needed to diagonalize the matrix : @xmath34 so that @xmath35 with the ordering @xmath36 .    on the other hand , the neutral supersymmetric",

    "maskawa cp phase in the sm can in principle contribute to the electron edm , but it turns out to be effective only at three  loop level so that the contribution is too small to be measured .",
    "one of the important features of the susy contributions to the electron edm is the fact that the edm requires different chirality of the initial and final electrons . in the supersymmetric diagrams this chirality flip can happen in two ways  either the exchanged selectrons change chirality via @xmath90-@xmath54 mixing terms in the selectron mass matrix and couple to the gaugino component of the intermediate spin1/2 particle , or the left and right  handed selectrons / sneutrinos preserve their chirality and couple to the higgsino components of the charginos or neutralinos , respectively . as a result ,",
    "all contributions are directly proportional to the mass of the external electron since both the @xmath90-@xmath54 mixing selectron mass term and the higgsino  electron - selectron ( or sneutrino ) coupling are proportional to the relevant electron yukawa coupling @xmath91 .",
    "another consequence of the chirality flip is the explicit proportionality of the contributions to the mass of the intermediate spin1/2 particle .",
    "generally , the susy contributions to the electron edm are determined by 7 real parameters @xmath92 for the left and right  handed selectrons , because at any rate two states are not degenerate due to extra contributions to their masses . for six real susy parameters ,",
    "we consider two typical scenarios where three cp phases are left as free parameters . in both scenarios ,",
    "the gaugino mass unification condition is assumed only for the modulus of the gaugino mass parameters ; @xmath93 and the size of the trilinear parameter @xmath94 is set to 1 tev through the paper .",

    "the second scenario @xmath104 takes a small universal soft  breaking selectron mass , but a large value of @xmath100 : @xmath105 in this scenario , we expect that some cancellations among the cp phases are needed to suppress the electron edm .",
    "of course , the degree of the cancellations depends on the values of the real susy parameters , especially the higgsino mass parameter @xmath100 .",
    "the reason why we take a large @xmath100 of 700 gev is to allow a relatively large region for the cp phases @xmath83 and @xmath84 while scanning the phase @xmath56 from 0 to @xmath106 .",

    "however , the dependence of the cross section on the phase @xmath83 is very different in two scenarios . in the scenario @xmath104 , the cross section increases monotonically as @xmath83 approaches @xmath162 , but it becomes maximal at a non - trivial value of @xmath83 between @xmath328 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath162 in the scenario @xmath99 .    compared with the dependence of the neutralino masses on the cp phases displayed in figure  4 , the cross section can be larger for larger neutralino masses and vice versa for quite large region of the cp phases .",
    "this implies that within the range allowed in the scenarios the signals with larger masses can have more possibility of being detected while those with smaller masses may escape detection . in this sense",
    ", future high luminosity experiments can give constraints on the cp phases simply by putting the upper limits on the event rates .",
    "the invariant mass of two final  state leptons @xmath329 , which is nothing but the square root of the mandelstam variable , @xmath330 , @xmath331 is a lorentz  invariant kinematical variable so that it is easy to reconstruct by measuring the energies of two final  state leptons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the distribution for the invariant mass @xmath329 is independent of the specific production process for the decaying neutralino .",
    "this factorization is due to the fact that the invariant mass does not involve any angular variables describing the decays so that the polarization of the decaying neutralino is not effective .",
    "figure  15 shows the two  lepton invariant mass distribution in the scenarios ( a ) @xmath99 and ( b ) @xmath104 .",
    "this distribution must reflect the two  lepton invariant mass distribution of the neutralino decay @xmath332 itself multiplied by the total production cross section @xmath333 . as shown before",
    ", the leptonic branching ratio is very sensitive to the values of the underlying susy parameters .",
    "we find that the distribution of the invariant mass @xmath334 of the final  state two leptons is sensitive to the the cp phases as well .",
    "first of all , the end point of the maximal invariant mass is strongly dependent on the cp phases so that after all the real parameters are determined , the measurement of the end point will provide us with a very good handle to determine the cp phases .",
    "as one can notice from figure  15 , the sensitivity is larger in the scenario @xmath99 with a small @xmath100 parameter , which is more comparable to the value of @xmath31 than in the scenario @xmath104 .",
    "it clearly implies that the effect of the cp phases is enhanced for comparable gaugino and higgsino parameters .",
    "in passing , we note that since it is independent of the production mechanism , the lepton invariant mass distribution can be an important tool for studying supersymmetric models even at hadron colliders because of its clean signature .",
    "this point has been in detail explored by nojiri and yamada @xcite by investigating the parameter dependence of the distribution of the three body decay @xmath1 at the cern lhc .      in this section ,",
    "we give numerical results for the angular distributions of @xmath247 with respect to the electron beam axis computed with complete spin correlations between production and decay .",
    "unlike the invariant mass distribution , this lepton angular distribution is crucially dependent on the production  decay spin correlations .",
    "moortgat  pick and",
    "fraas @xcite have found in their detailed study that the effect of the spin correlations for the lepton angular distribution amounts up to 20% for lower energies and the shape of the lepton angular distribution is very sensitive to the mixing in the gaugino sector and to the value of the slepton mass .",
    "these points can be confirmed by comparing two results displayed in figure  16 . in the scenario @xmath99 ( left figure ) with large selectron masses ,",
    "the lepton angular distribution is forward ",
    "backward symmetric and larger in the forward ",
    "backward direction . on the other hand , in the scenario",
    "@xmath104 the angular distribution is forward ",
    "backward asymmetric , maximal near @xmath335 but suppressed in the forward  backward directions .",
    "furthermore , the size of the lepton angular distribution and the forward ",
    "backward asymmetry depends rather strongly on the cp phases .",
    "so far , we concentrate mainly on the cp  even production  decay correlated observables which depend on the cp phases only indirectly",
    ". however , the initial electron momentum and two easily  reconstructible final  state leptons allows us to construct a t  odd observable @xmath336 with @xmath337 .",
    "observable @xmath338 @xcite can be finite if there exist non  vanishing cp  violating or cp  preserving complex phases in the amplitude for the correlated process . if we neglect the heavy particle widths , the t  odd observable",
    "can be utilized to directly measure the cp phases or to constrain them .    due to the general property of the t ",
    "odd observable , we know that it should be given a linear combination of the cp  odd quartic charges @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "note that in the scenario @xmath99 with large slepton masses , both of them are proportional to a small suppression factor @xmath341 as noticed in eq .",
    "therefore , the t  odd observable as well as the electron edm can not give any significant constraints on the cp phases in the scenario @xmath99 . on the other hand , since the slepton exchanges give a large contribution in the scenario @xmath104 , there might be a relatively large value of the t ( cp)odd observable for no  trivial phases .",
    "furthermore , since the fundamental structure of the electron edm determined by the cp phases will be very different from that of the t  odd observable , two cp  odd quantities will play a complementary role in constraining the cp phases . in order to make a concrete comparison of them",
    ", we explore the exclusion region by the t ",
    "odd observable on the cp phases @xmath104 in the scenario @xmath104 .",
    "since we can not estimate the precise systematic uncertainties mainly related with the detection quality , we neglect the systematic uncertainties but take into account only the statistical errors .",
    "in this case , the boundaries of the excluded region of the cp phases @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 at the @xmath342@xmath343 level for a given integrated luminosity satisfy the relation @xmath344 where @xmath345 over the total phase space volume @xmath346 . in determining the exclusion area",
    "we take into account two possible combinations of two final  state leptons;@xmath347 and @xmath348 , which is responsible for the factor 2 in the denominator .",
    "figure  17 exhibits the excluded area of the cp phases by the electron edm measurements at 95% confidence level ( shaded region ) and by the t  odd observable @xmath338 ( hatched region ) at a 2@xmath343 level with an integrated luminosity of 200 fb@xmath327 .",
    "one can clearly notice their complementarity role played by two independent cp  odd quantities .",
    "the t  odd observable enables us to exclude all the range of @xmath83 for most values of @xmath84 except for @xmath349 .",
    "in addition , they are complementary in the sense that the electron edm is an indirect physical quantity determined at a very low energy , which does not need to observe susy particles but the t  odd observable @xmath338 is a direct observable to measure the susy cp phases exclusively , which however requires producing neutralinos directly .",
    "so , we conclude that through our investigations the t ",
    "odd observable can be a very efficient and complementary quantity in constraining or determining the cp phases if the lightest and second lightest neutralinos are pair  produced and unless the sleptons are too heavy .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the associated production of neutralinos @xmath0 accompanied by the neutralino leptonic decay @xmath1 , taking into account initial beam polarization and production - decay spin correlations in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with general cp phases but without generational mixing in the slepton sector . the stringent constraints by the electron edm on the cp phases have been also included in the discussion of the effects of the cp phases .",
    "first of all , we have described possible flavor  preserving  selectron , chargino and neutralino  mixings in the mssm with general cp phases without generational mixing and applied them to the evaluation of the electron edm to investigate its dependence on the phases . as a result , we have identified two typical scenarios ; one has large selectron masses of the order of 10 tev and the other relatively light selectron masses of 200 gev and a large higgisino mass parameter .",
    "the first scenario allows the full range for the cp phases @xmath83 and @xmath83 relevant to the neutralino process while the second scenario allows a finite space for the cp phases . employing the allowed space as the platform for further investigations of the neutralino processes",
    ", we have obtained several interesting results , which can be summarized as follows :    * the production cross section and the branching fractions of the leptonic neutralino decays are very sensitive to the cp phases . as a result",
    ", the total cross section is very sensitive to the cp phases . * if the electron / positron masses are neglected , the initial longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the initial electron and positron beams lead to three cp  even distributions and one cp  odd distribution , which can be studied independently of the details of the neutralino decays . while they are sensitive to the real susy parameters , those observables , especially , the t ( cp)odd observable @xmath203 is ( almost ) insensitive to the cp phases in both scenarios . * the production ",
    "decay spin correlations lead to several cp  even observables among them we have studied the two  lepton invariant mass distribution , the lepton angular distribution , and one interesting t  odd ( cp  odd ) triple product of the initial electron momentum and two final lepton momenta . on the whole , we have found that the distributions are sensitive to the cp phases in the scenario @xmath104 with relatively light selectrons and large gaugino compositions of the neutralinos . *",
    "we have presented the exclusion region of the cp phases @xmath83 and @xmath84 by the t ",
    "odd ( cp  odd ) observable with the assumed integrated luminosity of 200 fb@xmath327 at 2-@xmath343 level . in comparison with the constraints from the electron edm measurements , the constraints from the t ",
    "odd observable is complementary in that it constrains very strongly the phase @xmath84 .",
    "to conclude , the associated production of neutralinos @xmath350 followed by the leptonic @xmath9 decays @xmath237 is expected to be one of the cleanest susy processes to allow for a detailed investigation of the physics due to the cp phases in the mssm .",
    "therefore , if the neutralinos are produced at future @xmath4 colliders , the colliders will make it possible to measure or constrain the susy parameters and cp phases and so provide a complementary check for the existence of cp violation in the mssm in the neutralino sector .",
