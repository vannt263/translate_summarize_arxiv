    "with the advent of large scale surveys in the last two decades , several low - surface brightness , large - scale structures , extending hundreds to few thousand of square degrees in the sky , have been discovered in the halo of the milky way ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "contrary to the case of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy , whose debris has been found in well defined tidal streams wrapping around the full sky @xcite , these structures have more of a _ cloud _ morphology and their progenitors are still unknown @xcite .",
    "they are nonetheless interpreted as the remains of galaxies that were disrupted during the merging with the milky way ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at low - galactic latitudes , two such cloud - like structures have been found : the monoceros ring @xcite and the triangulum - andromeda overdensity @xcite . in both cases",
    "the interpretation of an extra - galactic origin for these features is not clear and their possible relationship with the galactic disk is still under investigation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at high galactic latitudes and",
    "far from the disk , there are several other structures : the virgo overdensity ( vod , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hercules - aquila cloud @xcite , the pisces overdensity @xcite and the eridanus - phoenix overdensity @xcite .",
    "although their interpretation as merger event , or events , is less ambiguous , the specific merging history is still unknown .",
    "the existence of more than one kinematic substructure in some of these clouds @xcite hints that they may contain either separate merger events , or different wraps of debris material from the same event .",
    "currently available data can not answer this issue .",
    "in addition , no progenitors have been associated with any of these cloud - like structures .",
    "one possible explanation is that these clouds are formed by debris of satellites in highly eccentric orbits whose stars pile - up near the apocenter of their orbit as they spend a longer time near that location @xcite .",
    "the true extensions of the clouds are also uncertain .",
    "a connection between several cloud - like sub - structures , which are located far from each other , has also been proposed .",
    "@xcite suggest , for example , that the vod , the hercules - aquila cloud and the eridanus - phoenix overdensity , all located at a distance of roughly @xmath3 kpc from the sun , may share a common polar - type orbit around the milky way and hence , may be related .",
    "clearly , more investigation is needed in order to understand the origin of these structures , their relationship with each other and their role in the formation of galaxies like our own milky way .",
    "connection between different sub - structures in the halo is not a new idea and `` streams of galaxies '' have been proposed before ( e.g. the fornax stream , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although proving their real connection has not been an easy task @xcite .",
    "detailed studies in the vod have proven to be very difficult mainly because of its very large expanse on the sky ( up to 3,000 sq .",
    "* ) , and extension along the line of sight ( @xmath4 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "these investigations often provide conflicting results .",
    "for example , using deep photometry , @xcite identified a main sequence population at 23 kpc near the center of the vod .",
    "they did not find clear evidence of a population at 19 kpc , which is where the main overdensity of rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) is located @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a peak in the velocity distribution of main sequence stars which is not coincident with the main peaks found by @xcite using f - turnoff stars and by @xcite using rrls .",
    "both the works of @xcite and @xcite were based in detailed studies of very small regions ( of the order of arcmin ) in an overdensity which covers a few thousand of square degrees . thus , rather than conflicting results , each study may be providing pieces for what seems to be a complex and large puzzle .    here",
    "we present an expanded kinematic study in the vod region covering @xmath0 sq degrees using rrls as tracers , building on the earlier investigation by @xcite of the area of the sky covered by the quest survey , which is @xmath5 times smaller than our present study .",
    "rrls are abundant in the vod , and indeed , this type of stars provided the first indication of an overdensity @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of using rrls as tracers of the old population of halo sub - structures is that they are excellent standard candles .",
    "rrls are pulsating variable stars located on the horizontal branch in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ; consequently their luminosities span only a small range , allowing the precise determination of their distances .",
    "period - luminosity relationships have been found for rrls in all bands from optical to infrared bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a combination of good 3d positioning of rrls ( coordinates and distance ) with radial velocities provide a powerful way to disentangle the kinematic groups within the region of the vod .",
    "catalogs of rrls covering large portions of the sky @xcite have been made available in the last few years , providing the targets for this type of investigation .",
    "our primary source of rrls comes from la silla - quest survey ( lsq , * ? ? ? * ) , a 840 sq deg survey covering a large portion of the vod .",
    "this survey provides a catalog of 1,372 rrls with well - sampled light curves ( mean number of epochs per star is @xmath6 ) and covering a range of distances between 5 and 80 kpc from the sun .",
    "an overdensity of rr lyrae stars in the virgo region , between 5 and 20 kpc , is easily distinguished in this survey ( see figure 14 in * ? ? ?",
    ", we concentrate in the region where the vod seems to be present according to the density maps shown in @xcite , specifically @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this region , there are 1,054 rrls in the catalog .",
    "the lsq survey has partial overlap in the virgo region with other large scale surveys of rrls , including quest @xcite , the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the lincoln near - earth asteroid research program ( linear * ? ? ?",
    "the quest survey covers a relatively narrow band of declination , between @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; it has a lower number of epochs ( @xmath11 ) than lsq , which is sufficient for obtaining good parameters of the light curves .",
    "our previous study on kinematic groups in the vod was based on this survey @xcite .",
    "the crts catalogs of drake et al . provide @xmath12 rrls in all the sky between declination @xmath13 and @xmath14 with a large number of epochs ( a few hundred ) .",
    "the catalog contains rrls up to @xmath15 kpc @xcite .",
    "finally , linear covers @xmath16 sq degrees of the sky .",
    "although this is a shallower survey ( reaching only to 30 kpc ) , it covers the range of distance of the vod . since none of those surveys is complete by itself , we cross - matched all catalogs , and obtained a list of 1,410 unique rrls in the vod region . for stars in common between different catalogs , we adopted preferentially the light curve properties measured by lsq because it is the deepest of these catalogs .",
    "both the amplitude of the light curve and the time at maximum light are necessary to calculate the systemic radial velocity of the stars , as explained later .",
    "the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite do not provide the time at maximum light for the catalogued rrls .",
    "for those stars , we downloaded the light curve data from the crts dr2 webpage and fit a template to the light curve in order of obtaining the hjd@xmath17 ( see * ? ? ?",

    "presumably they were targeted as blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in sdss or quasar candidates , which may overlap in color with rrls .",
    "these spectra have a wavelength coverage of 3800 - 9200 ( 3650 - 10400 for boss spectra ) , which for rrls means that many balmer lines and several metallic lines ( including ca ii h and k ) are present .",
    "a potential problem about using spectra of rrls from sdss is that there is the possibility that the final spectrum of a star is made of stacks of spectra taken non - consecutively , or even in different nights . because the radial velocity of an rrls changes by up to @xmath18 @xmath19 during the pulsation cycle , and the effective temperature and luminosity change by significant amounts as well",
    ", the composite of spectra taken at very different phases may yield a radial velocity that is far from the star s sytemic radial velocity by amount that is very hard to determine . to avoid this problem ,",
    "the sdss dr12 database was queried with the following restrictions : _ ( i ) _ all observations were done on a unique date ( in practice , only one date listed in the keyword _ mjdlist _ in table _ platex _ ) , _ ( ii ) _ there were no flags associated with the radial velocity ( _ zwarning_@xmath20 ) , and _ ( iii )",
    "_ the total exposure time had to be less than 2 hours .",
    "after these constraints , we found 423 usable spectra in dr12 , several of which were multiple observations of the same star ( table  [ tab - sdss ] ) .",
    "the first constraint ensures that several exposures over multiple nights were not combined into a single spectrum .",
    "the constraint on the total exposure times avoids excessive blurring due to the changing radial velocity .",
    "a 2-hour exposure is equivalent to @xmath21 of the pulsation cycle of a typical ab - type rrls ( 0.55d ) .",
    "the corresponding phase - span for the shorter periods c - type stars is much longer . however",
    ", the change in radial velocity for these stars is much lower than for the ab types , of the order of 30 @xmath19and thus , it is not expected that it will have a large effect on the final velocities . in practice , however , the exposure times are rarely as large as two hours , and have a median of 1 hour .    in order to avoid the large discontinuity observed in the radial velocity curve of ab - type rrls at maximum light , we excluded any spectrum taken near the maximum light phase of the pulsation cycle of the ab - type rrls ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) .",
    "no restriction in phase was applied to the c - type stars since the discontinuity is not observed in these stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to implement this last restriction we calculated the phase of observation using the hjd of the spectrum at mid - exposure and the ephemeris and periods of the rrls from the photometric catalogs",
    "as said above , we gave preference to ephemeris provided by lsq in the case of stars in common among several catalogs .",
    "heliocentric radial velocities were obtained from the keyword _ elodiervfinal _ in table _ sppparams _ in the case of the sdss spectrograph , and from keyword _ elodiez _ in table _ specobjall _ for boss spectra .",
    "in addition to the sdss spectra , several rrls were observed by our team with the 4.1 m soar ( cerro pachn , chile ) and the 3.5 m wiyn ( kitt peak , usa ) telescopes . at soar , we used the goodman spectrograph with the 600 l / mm grating which yields a dispersion of 0.65  / pixel and a wavelength coverage from 3500 to 6160  . six rrls were observed with this telescope in february and march 2014 . with wiyn",
    ", we used the hydra multifiber positioner and grating 600@10.1 with the bench spectrograph to observe 26 additional rrls ( 49 individual spectra ) in the wavelength range 4000 to 6800  at 4.6 resolution .",
    "comparison lamps were obtained before and after each target spectrum with the goodman spectrograph and after each spectrum with the wiyn bench spectrograph to ensure accurate wavelength solutions .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf packages .    for the soar data ,",
    "radial velocities were measured using fourier cross - correlation with iraf task fxcor and elodie radial velocity standards selected by @xcite as templates .",

    "finally , new observations for 14 distant quest stars ( distances @xmath28 kpc ) were taken from a spectroscopic study of the sagittarius tidal tails ( duffau et al . in preparation ) .",
    "these stars were observed with gemini south , magellan and vlt ( fors2 ) telescopes with instrumental setups similar to others used in this work .",

    "this spectroscopic sample corresponds to @xmath29 of the known rrls in this region of the sky .",
    "to obtain the systemic radial velocity of rrls it is necessary to subtract the velocity due to the pulsation of the star . in this work , we adopted the radial velocity curves provided in @xcite which are based on an extensive set of measurements for six type ab rrls .",

    "second , @xcite provides a calibration between the amplitude of the light curve and the amplitude of each one of the radial velocity curve templates .",
    "the use of these templates and calibration represent an improvement for the determination of the systemic velocities compared to the traditional use of the model of a single star ( x arietis ) , which was constructed with measurements of the h@xmath31 line and had a fixed amplitude which was assumed to hold for any rrls ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for uniformity",
    ", we used these templates to re - calculate the systemic velocities of all stars in our sample , including the ones previously reported in the literature .    for type ab stars we followed the following steps in order to derive the systemic radial velocities :    * depending on the wavelength range of each particular spectrum , we selected which template(s ) were to be used for correcting the pulsation velocity .",
    "for example , sdss velocities are measured by fourier cross - correlations using the complete spectral range , which contain the three balmer lines considered above and a wealth of metallic lines .",
    "consequently , all four templates were used on these spectra . on the other hand , for the soar spectra we only used the h@xmath24 and h@xmath31 templates , while for the wiyn data",
    ", the three balmer line templates were used . *",
    "each template was scaled by the amplitude of the light curve of the rrls according to equations 2 - 5 in @xcite .",
    "* having calculated the mean phase of observation of a spectrum , we interpolated in each one of the selected radial velocity templates to obtain a pulsational velocity at that phase * the pulsation velocity was subtracted from the measured velocity to give the systemic velocity for each template . in the case of sdss spectra ,",
    "the measured velocity is the one reported in table  [ tab - sdss ] , while for the soar and wiyn spectrum is the velocity measured for the specific balmer line of the template . *",
    "the results from the different templates were weighted by their errors and then averaged to yield our final systemic velocity .",
    "the resulting systemic velocities derived from each template were not very different .",
    "for example , for the sdss data , the standard deviation of the four velocities obtained from each template averaged 15 @xmath19 . *",
    "if more than one spectrum for the same star was available , the systemic velocities were averaged . *",
    "the errors of systemic velocities were estimated following @xcite and @xcite , which included the error in the velocity measurement and the error of the template at the phase of observation .",
    "figure  [ fig - rv652 ] illustrates the radial velocity curve fitting for star lsq 652 ( @xmath32 ) which was observed with the wiyn telescope at two different phases .",
    "the same approach described above was followed to recalculate the systemic velocities in the catalog of @xcite since they used x arietis as the radial velocity template .",
    "a comparison of the present results with those of @xcite show that the mean difference in radial velocity for the stars in common is only 1 @xmath19 , with a standard deviation of 19 @xmath19 .",
    "the differences are partly due to the use of the new radial velocity templates , but a significant contribution comes from our use of updated ephemerides in this work ( those from the lsq survey ) . indeed , if we use the same ephemerides as @xcite to fit the new radial velocity curves , the standard deviation of the velocity differences decreases to only 9 @xmath19 .",
    "this suggests that the results of previous investigations that used only x arietis as a template are not seriously biased by the choice of template .    as mentioned before",
    ", we included 5 rrls with kinematical data from @xcite which lie in the range @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "these stars are important because they extend our coverage toward southern declinations .",
    "the systemic radial velocities of these stars were calculated using the star x arietis as template , and we were unable to re - calculate the velocity using the new templates because there was no information on the individual spectra for each star in @xcite .",
    "the above comparison with the results of @xcite suggests that that the velocities given by @xcite may be used without any correction .",
    "rrls of the type c have smaller variations in the radial velocities during the pulsation cycle . for these stars we used the template given in @xcite and @xcite to derive the systemic radial velocities .",
    "the final sample of rrls with radial velocities in the virgo region consists of 412 stars , which is roughly 6 times larger than the sample in @xcite , and it covers a much larger area and range of distances from the sun ( @xmath35 kpc ) .",

    "the median value is only 8 @xmath19 which is encouraging that we are correcting appropriately the pulsation velocity of the rrls and that there are no large systematic differences between different instrumental setups .",
    "only a few stars had standard deviation in their velocities of the order of 25 - 45 @xmath19 .",
    "every time the standard deviation from multiple spectra was larger than the error in the systemic velocity ( which includes both the observational and the template error ) , we adopted the former as the final error .",

    "lsq has a superior lightcurve based on 158 epochs , which we have used to re - derive the radial velocity .",
    "we obtained @xmath37 @xmath19 , which is higher than the value of 134 @xmath19 reported by @xcite , but still consistent , within error to the mean velocity of proper - motion vss stars in @xcite .",
    "the lsq distance , however , is compromised because the photometric calibration for this star was flagged as being poor , which means it can produce distance errors of @xmath38 @xcite .",

    "this new implementation of the method makes it more robust in a sample covering a large range of distances , as encountered here .",
    "the method is basically a friends - of - friends algorithm which selects pairs of stars which are located in nearby ( 3d ) positions in the sky and share a similar velocity , or formally , stars that have a four - distance value less than a critical value , or @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "pairs with common stars ( friends - of - friends ) form a group . the @xmath40 parameter is defined as :    @xmath41    where ( @xmath42 ) is the mean physical separation between stars @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which can be calculated using their galactocentric cartesian coordinates ( assuming @xmath45 kpc ) :    @xmath46    as defined in @xcite and @xcite , the weights @xmath47 and @xmath48 in equation  [ eq - old4d ] depend on both the maximum possible range for those quantities and the observational errors . in the case of @xmath48 , the observational error appeared in the form of a relative error ( @xmath49 ) . using those weights , we searched for sub - structures in @xcite using @xmath50 , which implied a separation between stars in a pair @xmath51",

    "similarly , a pair can have a maximum separation of 2 times the error in the mean distance of the pair , which equals 1.4 kpc at 10 kpc or 7 kpc at 50 kpc , if the stars have exactly the same radial velocity .",
    "applying equation  [ eq - new4d ] to our sample , we found 558 pairs of stars ( figure  [ fig - pairs ] ) and 22 groups ( figure  [ fig - allgroups ] ) .",
    "most of the groups of rrls have a small number of members ( @xmath77 ) but two of them have particularly large number of stars , one with 18 members at a distance of @xmath78 kpc and another one with 113 members at @xmath79 kpc .",
    "it is likely that some of these groups , particularly the ones with a small number of members , are produced by random variations in a smooth distribution of stars . in order to quantify how frequently these cases may occur",
    ", we simulated a large number of random samples of halo stars , which were used as input in our group - finding algorithm .",

    ", we were able to identify which of the rrls groups are unlikely be simply formed by random in a smooth distribution of stars .",
    "we made 10,000 simulated samples with the following recipe .",
    "first , we estimated how many rrls are expected in this area of the sky in the range of distances between 4 and 70 kpc by integrating the rrls number density profile provided in @xcite . for simplicity",
    "the area of observations was approximated to a rectangular region with limits @xmath80 and @xmath81 , which is where most of our spectroscopic sample is found ( see figure  [ fig - sample ] ) .",
    "this integration yielded 767 rrls in this volume of the halo .",
    "because the completeness of the lsq survey ( which was used to derive that profile ) is estimated to be 70% , we divided this number by 0.7 to obtain the true expected number of rrls .",
    "however , our spectroscopic sample is not complete ; only @xmath82 of the real rrls have at least one spectrum available .",
    "taking into account this factor , we simulated samples of stars having @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",
    "although the spectroscopic completeness varies some with location on the sky because the different datasets were combined , we assumed for simplicity uniform completeness in our simulations .",
    "to each star in the simulated sample , we assigned a random position , heliocentric distance and radial velocity .",
    "the positions were randomly assigned within the rectangular region defined above .",
    "distances were randomly drawn from a distribution that is based on the number density radial profile of rrls @xcite , in the range galactocentric distances ( @xmath85 ) from @xmath86 to 90 kpc .",
    "this profile has an flattening of @xmath87 and a double power law with a steeper slope beyond @xmath88 kpc .",
    "a @xmath89 error , similar to the observational error of the real rrls , was added to the resulting distance .",
    "radial velocities ( @xmath90 ) were randomly assigned following a gaussian distribution with mean 0 @xmath19and standard deviation which was a function of the distance from the galactic center , following the velocity dispersion profile given by @xcite for bhb stars in the halo .",
    "brown et al.s profile is defined from @xmath91 to 80 kpc .",
    "we assumed that the velocity dispersion at 15 kpc ( 103 @xmath19 ) also holds to the inner limit of our sample ( @xmath92 kpc ) .",
    "the assumed velocity dispersion at a given distance took into account the errors in the profile derived by @xcite .",
    "noise with the typical observational error of 13.8 @xmath19 was added to the assigned radial velocity .      as expected , our algorithm detected pairs and groups in the simulated samples .",
    "the mean number of pairs found in the simulated samples is 148 , which is significantly lower than the 558 pairs found among the rrls .",

    "the number of groups , however , are about the same , 21 on average in the simulated data and 22 in the real data .",
    "evidently , many of the pairs in the real data originate in only a few sub - structures .",
    "the real data contain indeed two relatively large structures , with 113 and 18 members , in which our algorithm connected many pairs of stars .",
    "in contrast , the simulations produced mostly groups with small numbers of members ( figure  [ fig - nmembers ] ) . the median number of members among the 210,298 groups formed in the 10,000 simulations is 4 stars .",
    "the 95th percentile of the distribution of the number of members is 14 , and the largest group formed in all 10,000 simulations has 83 members . based on size alone , the most populous groups in the rrls sample are very likely to be real , and in fact they are due to the previously well - documented stream of stars from the sgr dwarf sphoidal ( dsph ) galaxy and the virgo stellar stream ( vss ) .",

    "any group whose velocity and/or distance is far from the mean values of these quantities in fake groups of the same @xmath94 is likely real and will be flagged as significant .",
    "the group of rrls with 113 members is not plotted because none of the fake groups was so populated .    to illustrate the usefulness of figure  [ fig - percentile ] , consider the group of rrls plotted as blue upside down triangle .",
    "it has only 5 members , and groups of that size are frequently produced in the simulations ( figure  [ fig - nmembers ] ) .",
    "but the mean @xmath95 of this group is 184 @xmath19 , and comparable values are very rarely seen in 5-member groups in the simulations ( the upper 95th percentile is @xmath96 @xmath19 ) because this value is in the tail of the velocity distribution of halo stars .",

    "no new member was found here , and indeed , not all members in @xcite were picked here due to our stricter criteria in the separation between stars forming a pair at short distances .",
    "group 4 seems to be confined to @xmath107 and it was flagged as significant because its velocity is very high .",
    "group 293 in @xcite overlaps in distance and velocity with this group of rrls but its stars are clumped around @xmath108 .",
    "groups 2 and 4 lie in approximately the same region of the sky , and in velocity - distance diagram , group 4 appears to be an extension of group 2 to higher @xmath90 and shorter distance .",
    "their separate identities could be simply a consequence of our strict criteria on group membership .",
    "conversely , they could truly separate and originated in separate accretion events , or they might be different wraps of the stellar streams from one event .",

    "low significance group 9 lies at approximately the same distance as group 4 .",

    "two other groups along the same line of sight , groups 3 and 8 , have negative velocities , but quite different distances , 10.4 and 17.0 kpc , respectively .",
    "a number of other studies of the vod have detected negative velocity peaks @xcite , which overlap with the velocities of these groups of rrls . given the large distance uncertainties inherent in the main - sequence stars and red giants observed in these other studies , it is not clear that these observations relate to sgr debris at @xmath110 kpc , as suggested by these authors , or are a mixture sgr debris and the same structures as rrls groups 3 and 8 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig - significant_groups ] , group 3 and another group of rrls with negative velocity , group 9 , overlap in distance and velocity with a weakly populated feature of the @xcite model of the sgr streams , which is due to its trailing tail .",
    "again , proper motion data are needed to test the reality of the rrls groups and this possible association .",
    "three high significance groups of rrls are located at distances larger than 40 kpc . in the background of figure  [ fig - significant_groups ]",
    ", we show the location of sgr debris in this region of the sky from the models of @xcite .",

    "the magenta dots are the ones that match observations from 2mass and sdss @xcite .",
    "our numerous group 1 ( red triangles ) closely follow the debris indicated by the magenta dots .",
    "the agreement in the sky ( panel d ) and in velocity ( a ) is remarkably good .",
    "there seems to be a systematic offset of @xmath5 kpc in heliocentric distance ( see panel b ) , with the model being farther away than our group .",
    "this discrepancy , which was also noticed by @xcite , may be due to differences in the adopted distance scale between the model and our data .",
    "a similar discrepancy was recently observed using numerous main sequence stars in the next generation virgo cluster survey ( ngvs , * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , our rrls group displays the same gradients in distance and velocity as a function of ra as the models . in position , distance , and velocity ,",
    "group 1 agrees well with the observations by @xcite of bhb and m giants in the sgr stream .",
    "the velocities of the group 1 stars also overlap with the major peaks in the velocities of the main - sequence stars observed by @xcite and the red giant stars observed by @xcite in relatively small fields in the vod .",
    "both papers identified the velocity peaks with the sgr stream .",
    "two other groups in table 5 , which have only three members each , were judged significant because they are very distant .",
    "the most distant group ( group 6 , blue asterisks ) has a mean distance of 56 kpc and a velocity similar to that of the main sgr group .",
    "it is , however , located westward of this group ( see panel b and c ) . at its location ( @xmath111 ) the most recent wrap of sgr debris , according to the model of @xcite , is expected to have a very low density and be closer than this group of rrls by @xmath112 kpc without any correction for a difference in distance scale and @xmath113 kpc with correction .",
    "a better match is obtained with the predicted debris from the earlier wrap ( cyan dots in figure  [ fig - significant_groups ] ) , although a difference of @xmath1 kpc still exists .",
    "@xcite have concluded from the spatial distribution of the lsq rrls that this wrap may not exist in this area of the sky . on the basis of these factors ,",
    "we conclude that group 6 is probably not sgr debris .",
    "the other distant group , group 5 ( green diamonds ) , overlaps in space with group 1 , which is undoubtedly sgr debris , but its velocity is quite different .",
    "while groups of such small numbers of stars must be viewed with some caution , if groups 5 and 6 are indeed real , they provide additional evidence that the outer halo is laced with accretion debris , as predicted by recent models of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a more complete discussion on the sgr stream as seen by its rrls in a more extended sample is deferred to a future publication .      at @xmath114",
    ", there is a candidate dwarf galaxy identified by @xcite in the footprint of sdss and located at @xmath110 kpc from the sun .",
    "the existence of this galaxy has been challenged by @xcite who claims that there is a distant cluster of galaxies at that position of the sky which may have been confused for a stellar overdensity in the shallower sdss data .",
    "however , @xcite built deep cmds in this location and in a neighbor one , at @xmath115 , and concluded that both fields contain indeed a population of stars , not at 40 kpc but at 23 kpc .",
    "the fact that the main sequence observed in both fields is similar , makes the authors believe that they were detecting not a dwarf galaxy but and extended structure likely related to the vod .",
    "they also ruled out the presence of a significant stellar population at 19 kpc , where the vss rrls stars are concentrated .",
    "this non - detection of a main sequence at the distance of the vss by @xcite may be due to the low surface brightness of the feature and the small areas of the fields observed by @xcite . note that main - sequence of the vss is well - documented by the studies of @xcite and @xcite in other fields .",

    "<S> we use a combination of spatial distribution and radial velocity to search for halo sub - structures in a sample of 412 rr lyrae stars ( rrls ) that covers a @xmath0 square degrees region of the virgo overdensity ( vod ) and spans distances from the sun from 4 to 75 kpc . with a friends - of - friends algorithm we identified six high significance groups of rrls in phase space , which we associate mainly with the vod and with the sagittarius stream . </S>",
    "<S> four other groups were also flagged as less significant overdensities . </S>",
    "<S> three high significance and 3 lower significance groups have distances between @xmath1 and 20 kpc , which places them with the distance range attributed by others to the vod . </S>",
    "<S> the largest of these is the virgo stellar stream ( vss ) at 19 kpc , which has 18 rrls , a factor of 2 increase over the number known previously . while these vod groups are distinct according to our selection cirteria , their overlap in position and distance , and , in a few cases , similarity in radial velocity are suggestive that they may not all stem separate accretion events . </S>",
    "<S> even so , the vod appears to be caused by more than one overdensity . </S>",
    "<S> the sgr stream is a very obvious feature in the background of the vod at a mean distance of 44 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> two additional high significant groups were detected at distances @xmath2 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> their radial velocities and locations differ from the expected path of the sgr debris in this part of the sky , and they are likely to be remnants of other accretion events . </S>"
