    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binary stars containing a white dwarf primary star in a close orbit with a low - mass secondary star which fills its roche lobe . in most of these systems",
    "the secondary component is unevolved and is transferring material to the white dwarf primary via an accretion disc .",
    "comprehensive reviews of the properties of cvs have been given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the evolution of cvs is governed primarily by angular momentum loss ( aml ) from the binary orbit .",
    "this is important during the phase of common - envelope evolution , where an initially wide orbit is dramatically shrunk due to the ejection of the envelope .",
    "the efficiency of this process is poorly understood , although recent advances @xcite are promising ( see @xcite for further discussion ) . for many objects",
    "this results in a close but detached binary system .",
    "further aml causes the binary to become semidetached and undergo mass transfer .",
    "this aml is thought to occur mainly in two ways : by the emissison of gravitational radiation @xcite and due to magnetic braking via the stellar wind @xcite which acts on the secondary star @xcite .",
    "according to the standard theory of cv evolution , magnetic braking is the dominant aml mechanism for the longer - period systems but abruptly terminates when the secondary star becomes completely convective .",
    "this disruption occurs when the orbital period has decreased to approximately three hours @xcite .",
    "the distended secondary star is then able to shrink until it returns to thermal equilibrium , so no longer fills its roche lobe .",
    "this disrupted magnetic braking scenario was formulated to explain the 23hr ` gap ' in the orbital period distribution of cvs @xcite , which contains far fewer systems than which occur at adjacent periods .",
    "whilst the cv is in the period gap , aml continues more slowly via gravitational radiation until a period of about two hours , at which point the roche lobe of the secondary shrinks onto the star s surface and mass transfer recommences .",
    "aml continues to shorten the orbital period until a minimum is reached at about 76min @xcite , where structural changes in the secondary star mean that further aml causes the orbital period to increase again .",
    "this results in faint ` period bounce ' systems with very low mass transfer rates @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the evolution of cvs @xcite are able to reproduce some of the features of the observed orbital period distribution of cvs @xcite , but there are several discrepancies between the predicted and observed distributions @xcite .",
    "firstly , it is predicted that the vast majority of cvs have orbital periods shorter than 3hr , whereas in the observed sample the numbers of systems above and below this value are roughly equal .",
    "secondly , the predicted minimum period is around 65min and there should be a large number of systems at this point due to the very slow rate of change of period with time .",
    "the minimum period in the observed cv sample is at approximately 76min ( excluding a small number of systems which contain evolved secondary stars ) and the observational sample does not contain a ` spike ' at this period .",
    "thirdly , population synthesis studies consistently find that at the present age of the galaxy about 70% of cvs should have evolved beyond the minimum period .",
    "whilst there are over six hundred known cvs @xcite there are very few candidate period bouncers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there are only _ two _ systems with a measured secondary star mass which is definitely below the hydrogen - burning limit : the eclipsing cvs sdssj103533.02 + 055158.3 @xcite and sdssj150722.30 + 523039.8 @xcite .",
    "a further problem with the standard disrupted magnetic braking evolutionary scenario is that there are many observations of very - low - mass fully convective stars which have strong magnetic fields @xcite , and no detections of a sudden cessation of magnetic braking in mdwarfs below a certain mass @xcite .",
    "the known population of cvs is extremely heterogeneous due to the number of different ways in which individual objects have been discovered @xcite .",
    "most of the methods of discovery are strongly biased towards detecting longer - period systems with higher mass transfer rates , because these are on average intrinsically brighter and bluer than short - period cvs .",
    "these effects mean that when comparing the observed population of cvs to theoretical predictions it is currently impossible to determine whether any discrepancies are due to the predictions being incorrect or to the large selection biases affecting the observed sample . the selection effects affecting observational studies of cvs have been considered in detail by @xcite for the case of the palomar - green survey @xcite .",
    "the selection biases in the known population of cvs are so strong and complex that this problem can only be reliably solved by studying a sample of cvs which has been homogeneously selected and is not strongly biased towards intrinsically bright or variable systems .",
    "recent studies of an homogeneous sample of cvs have included the population of objects spectroscopically identified in the hamburg quasar survey ( hqs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a complete magnitude - limited sample conducted using objective prism observations .",
    "@xcite have found that the hqs cvs are on average photometrically less variable than the overall sample of known cvs , confirming that spectroscopic identification is important for avoiding some selection biases .",
    "these authors also found an unexpected deficiency of short - period dwarf novae in their sample , resulting in a low number ratio of short - period to long - period systems for the newly - discovered hqs cvs .",
    "the corresponding space density of short - period hqs cvs is much lower than theoretically predicted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another sample arises from the 2df quasar survey , which has serendipitously identified a number of cvs via their spectroscopic characteristics .",
    "@xcite studied six of these objects and presented evidence that four of them had short periods , but the size of this sample must be increased before any detailed conclusions can be drawn .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we are engaged in a project to categorise the sample of cvs discovered by the sdss , the primary goal being measurement of the orbital period and other available quantities for each object . in this work",
    "we have presented spectroscopy and photometry from four telescopes , and measured the orbital periods of six sdss cvs ( table[tab : result ] ) .    of the six cvs for which we have measured orbital periods ,",
    "two have values close to the minimum period for cvs with unevolved secondary stars : sdssj0050 with 80.3min and sdssj0131 with 80.54min .",
    "three objects have slightly longer periods but still qualify as short - period systems : sdssj1555 with 113.54min , sdssj2059 with 107.518min and sdssj2104 with 103.62min .",
    "we observed sdssj2059 during the decline from its first recorded outburst so are able to classify it as a dwarf nova .",
    "only one system , sdssj0754 , has an orbital period ( @xmath5min ) which is longer than the 23hr period gap .",
    "it also has a high mass transfer rate .",
    "the orbital velocity amplitude for sdssj0131 is only @xmath8kms@xmath9 .",
    "using several constraints we find that this system has an extremely low mass ratio and contains a massive white dwarf and/or a very low - mass secondary star .",
    "the mass donor is a good candidate for being a cv secondary star with a mass below the minimum required for core hydrogen burning .",
    "our photometry of sdssj0754 and sdssj1555 show that they are eclipsing systems with 0.5mag and 1.5mag deep eclipses ( in unfiltered light ) , respectively .",
    "sdssj1555 is a good candidate for accurate measurement of the absolute properties of a short - period cv , as the functional form of its eclipse is well understood ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar analysis for sdssj0754 is not currently possible due to the complexities of the novalike class of cvs .",
    "a recurrent theme in the previous paragraphs is that the orbital periods we are finding for the sdss cvs are almost all shorter than the 23hr period gap , and in many cases adjacent to the observed 76min minimum period .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that shorter - period cvs are not only intrinsically fainter but more populous that their longer - period counterparts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the orbital period distribution of those sdss cvs with known periods is much closer to theoretical predictions than the distribution for the complete sample of known cvs .",
    "we would like to warmly thank david boyd and tom krajci for their speed in responding to our request for observations of sdssj2059 after our spectroscopic observations indicated that it might be in outburst .",
    "we are also grateful for a positive and timely review from the anonymous referee .",
