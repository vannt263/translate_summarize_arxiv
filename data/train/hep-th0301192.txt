    "thus we can set @xmath18 .    in order to perform the summation over @xmath15 that appears in eq .",

    "the function @xmath25 is defined by the equation : @xmath26 from eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , if we drop the field independent term @xmath20 and integrate by parts , we obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 . our numerical study , in ref .",

    "however , the most interesting case is when @xmath46 and @xmath34 and @xmath2 are kept fixed ( see also refs .",
    "this means that we keep the spatial size of the magnetic field configuration fixed and we increase the characteristic magnetic field strength @xmath45 or the magnetic flux @xmath47 .    from eq .",
    "( 8) we see that the asymptotic behaviour of the effective energy when @xmath33 ( @xmath34 and @xmath2 are kept fixed ) depends on the asymptotic behaviour of the integrals : @xmath48 in the case of the integral of eq .",

    "[ 1 ] we have performed numerical calculations for four magnetic field configurations with quite different kinds of inhomogeneity .",
    "@xmath63 we expect that our numerical work , presented in fig . [ 1 ] , convinces the reader that the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath60 , as given by eq .",
    "( 17 ) , does not depend on the kind of inhomogeneity of the magnetic flux tube .",
    "thus , when @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath2 are kept fixed , from eqs .",
    "( 8),(16 ) and ( 17 ) we obtain @xmath64 we see that the logarithmic term dominates , so we can write @xmath65 if , instead of the characteristic magnetic field strength @xmath66 we use the parameter @xmath67 we see that the fermion - induced effective energy , for @xmath68 , is proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath70 this asymptotic behaviour is correct , independently of the particular shape of the magnetic flux tube , as it was shown in the above numerical study ( see fig . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "note that the above asymptotic formula , of eq .",

    "for these two cases , the asymptotic formula , of eq .",
    "( 23 ) , is obtained straightforwardly from eqs .",
    "( 8) and ( 16 ) , and thus knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour of the integral @xmath60 is not necessary .    finally , we note that our numerical study in fig . [ 1 ] is not sufficient to exclude a logarithmic growing of @xmath74",
    ". however this logarithmic dependence , even if it really exists , should be weak compared to the logarithmic dependence which appears in the asymptotic formula of eq .",
    "( 23 ) , otherwise it would be clearly shown in fig . [ 1 ] and it is not .    in order to observe a possible weak logarithmic growing we ought to perform computations in an exponentially large range of values of @xmath45 .",
    "we could not execute computations for so wide a range , as the differential equation for the computation of the phase shifts ( eq .",
    "( 69 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is stiff for large @xmath45 .",
    "however , we tried an estimate of this logarithmic dependence by fitting a curve of the form @xmath75 to our data , as they are presented in fig . [ 1 ] .",
    "we find that @xmath76 for @xmath77 , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "these results imply that , even if this logarithmic term @xmath84 really exists , it would not contribute to the effective energy ( as it is given by the asymptotic formula of eq .",
    "( 23 ) above ) more than 5 per cent .",
    "an approximate way for the computation of the fermion - induced effective energy is the derivative expansion @xcite .",
    "this method gives accurate results for smooth magnetic field configurations .",
    "note that the derivative expansion fails for the magnetic fields of eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , as the magnetic field of eq .",
    "( 20 ) is discontinuous and the magnetic field of eq .",
    "( 21 ) has discontinuous first derivative .",
    "our aim is to compare the strong field limit of the derivative expansion with the asymptotic formula of eq .",
    "( 23 ) .",
    "if we keep the first two terms of the derivative expansion , the effective energy , in the case of 3 + 1 dimensions , is given by the equation @xmath85+e^{(1)}_{(3 + 1)}[b,(\\partial b)^{2}]\\ ] ] where @xmath86 @xmath87 \\:e^{-s \\:m_{f}^{2}/b(\\vec{x } ) } ds\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath33 from eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) we obtain @xmath88 @xmath89 eq . ( 29 ) can be derived straight from eq .",
    "( 27 ) if we assume that @xmath90 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in order to derive eq . ( 28 ) from eq . ( 26 ) we have used a similar way with that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 28 ) , which gives the strong field limit of the derivative expansion , is in agreement with the asymptotic formula of eq . ( 23 ) .",
    "we emphasize that the arguments , which led us to the asymptotic formula of eq .",
    "( 23 ) , are based on a numerical study . in particular , we computed numerically @xmath60 for four magnetic field configurations with quite different kinds of inhomogeneity ( see eqs . ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) ) .",
    "our results in fig . [ 1 ] suggest that @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath37 ( for @xmath91 ) independently of the specific form of the magnetic field configurations .",
    "the consequence of this result is that also the final formula , which states that @xmath92 for @xmath93 , is valid independently of the specific form of the magnetic field",
    ".    finally we showed , comparing with the asymptotic formula of eq .",
    "( 23 ) , that the leading term of the derivative expansion gives the same asymptotic behaviour for the fermion - induced effective energy in the strong magnetic field regime even in the case ( like that of the magnetic fields of eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and @xmath94 ) when the derivative expansion is invalid , because the next to the leading term diverges .",
