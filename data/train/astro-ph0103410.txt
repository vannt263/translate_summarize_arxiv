    "currently the standard picture of galaxy formation involves the collapse of baryonic matter in hierarchically clustering dark matter halos and the subsequent building of big galaxies from small ones via merging processes e.g. , @xcite .",
    "while recent cosmological simulations can adequately reproduce many global properties of galaxies and their correlations , the details are still very much dependent on the gas physics and stellar feedback involved ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . additionally , most , if not all , galaxies harbor supermassive black holes in their center @xcite .",
    "correlations have been recently detected between black hole masses , galaxy masses , and central velocity dispersions in galaxies @xcite .",
    "these correlations are strong evidence that black holes in galactic nuclei are linked to the dynamical history of their host galaxies . @xcite and @xcite",
    "demonstrate how this is consistent with the framework of semi - analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies in a cold dark matter - dominated universe .",
    "they assume supermassive black holes are formed and fueled during major mergers , qualitatively explaining many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies , including the observed relation between bulge luminosity , velocity dispersion , and central black hole mass .",
    "as already discussed by @xcite , such a scenario requires the formation of galactic nuclei containing at least two black holes , depending on the black hole merger rate relative to the galaxy merger rate . however , there is very little observational evidence for massive black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "this conflict between theory and observations has become known as the `` sinking black hole problem '' . as an alternative to minimally impacting stellar dynamical processes ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have proposed mechanisms which lead to rapid decay of massive black hole orbits and subsequent black hole mergers in galactic centers .",
    "also , @xcite offered the solution that gas accretion could dominate the orbital decay in the intermediate phase of the sinking black hole problem when dynamical friction becomes inefficient .",
    "however , as we will discuss later , dynamical friction , as laid out by @xcite , is not sufficiently effective by itself to lead to rapid coalescence of black hole binaries .",
    "if there are no quick mergers , multiple black hole nuclei could lose black holes through slingshot ejections @xcite .",
    "once a binary system becomes hard , the high orbital velocities of the black holes allow further hardening through close encounters and three - body interactions with stars .",
    "such processes will evacuate field stars from the surroundings of the binary , therefore it can be argued that the stellar scatterings can not produce rapid coalescence .",
    "the preceding argument assumes that the center of mass of the binary does not move with respect to the stellar system .",
    "however , we will show that even with a fairly symmetrical initial setup the binary gains some linear momentum .",
    "this introduces a wandering motion which exceeds the expectations from equipartition .",
    "the wandering of the binary guarantees an adequate supply of stars for binary hardening and rapid coalescence through purely stellar dynamical processes .",
    "our new computational method allows us to study in detail three - body interactions of a black hole binary with field stars .",
    "although one may argue that the perturbing mass of the field stars is small compared to the black hole mass and should have negligible impact , there are many stars , and each encounter can lead to changes in binding energy and eccentricity of the black hole binary .",
    "in fact , our models show that the black hole binary keeps a rather high eccentricity due to the encounters .",
    "thus high eccentricity will speed up gravitational radiation mergers very efficiently , and is , as noted by @xcite and @xcite , a way to expedite massive black hole mergers in a purely stellar dynamical way .",
    "the correct theoretical prediction of the frequency of black hole mergers in galactic environments will be important in the search for gravitational waves .",
    "the merging of supermassive black holes of @xmath2 to @xmath3 in the nuclei of merging galaxies and protogalaxies can be detected with high signal - to - noise at redshifts from @xmath4 @xcite by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to quantify this prediction have been made by either solving the perturbed two and three - body problem in simplified models @xcite , direct @xmath0-body models @xcite , or a combination of the two @xcite .",
    "simulating binary black hole hardening is extremely challenging , algorithmically and computationally .",
    "since the mass differences between the black holes and the stars is so large , high particle numbers are required in order to model the relaxation processes around the black holes accurately .",
    "the simulations have used softened particles on special purpose computers @xcite or a hierarchical hybrid code in which all forces involving the black hole particles are keplerian @xcite .",
    "these schemes used particle numbers in the order of @xmath5 .    in this paper , we describe a new hybrid field - particle code which treats all particles with orbits crossing the central regions of the system with a high precision direct @xmath0-body method appropriate for collisional stellar dynamics .",
    "all other particles are integrated using a field method . in order to adapt both parts of the hybrid code to each other , the field method ( approximating the potential exerted by a set of particles by a series expansion , referred to here as `` scf '' ) had to be upgraded to a fourth order hermite integrator .",
    "this integration also uses the time derivative of the potential , as in modern direct @xmath0-body codes .    in the following sections some details of the sinking black hole problem are introduced .",
    "section [ sec : es - intro ] introduces the integration software used for the numerical experiments described in this paper .",
    "section [ sec : es - testing ] is devoted to a comparison between the new collisional code with a well used workhorse simulator in this field called _ nbody6 _ @xcite , using its parallel implementation _",
    "nbody6++ _ @xcite .",
    "the application of the code to the sinking binary black hole problem is reported in section [ sec : blkh - runs ] .",
    "a numerical simulation of the hardening phase ( until the massive black holes start to radiate gravitational waves ) must be able to accurately follow three - body encounters .",
    "for this reason , the keplerian potential should not be softened in the denser parts of the system .",
    "computationally , the central part of the system would best be treated using a collisional integrator .",
    "the code must be able to integrate encounters leading to large angle deflections in an efficient way , while requiring neither too much computing time nor introducing energy errors .",
    "the overall @xmath0-body integration does not need to be symplectic , but should keep the energy error as low as possible . on the other hand , in a system showing a core halo structure , the bulk of the stars in the halo move under the influence of the mean field of the whole cluster .",
    "the halo part of the central galactic cluster can be integrated with a mean field method .    in the new method ( which we will refer to as eurostar ) , both the collisional code nbody6++ @xcite and the scf method @xcite are merged to optimize large-@xmath0 collisional @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the star cluster , which is assumed to be in equilibrium , is divided into two sections by applying a critical angular momentum criterion .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : decomp - scheme ] , this allows for distinction between particles orbiting solely in the halo and ones which have trajectories leading through the core of the system .    in a stationary gravitational point mass system",
    ", two - body relaxation leads to an exchange between halo particles and core particles in a divided cluster . in a system of",
    "more than @xmath5 particles , only a few particles cross the core halo border per dynamical time .",
    "this is very fortunate because it allows us to integrate the orbits of the halo particles with a collisionless method and the core particles with a collisional code .",
    "exchanges of particles cause energy conservation problems since the contribution of a particle to the main potential would be changed from keplerian to a sample point of a mean field in eurostar .",
    "this means that switching of particles from the core to the halo part of the integrator and vice versa is not permitted .",
    "nbody6++ integrates trajectories of point masses in the core of the system .",
    "it is an aarseth - type direct force integrator applying the hermite integration scheme .",
    "nbody6++ gains its efficiency by implementing an ahmad - cohen neighbor scheme and individual block time steps @xcite .",
    "close interactions between particles are treated by regularization of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "nbody6++ scales well on parallel computer systems and can also be used with the grape special purpose computer @xcite .",
    "the hermite scheme requires one to compute @xmath6 and @xmath7 at each time step where , @xmath8 .",
    "\\label{eq : direktfdot}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the relative distance between particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the relative velocity is @xmath12 .",
    "the extra effort of computing two direct force quantities allows one to approximate the particle s orbit to fourth order . by storing @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the previous time step it is possible to interpolate the next two higher derivatives and to apply a predictor / corrector scheme @xcite .",
    "the scf method qualifies for the collisionless part of a spherical system since then the basis functions are given analytically .",
    "this allows one to implement the hermite scheme for scf , which makes scf an ideal far force extension to nbody6++ .",
    "its drawback , however , is that this method restricts the input systems to have an approximately spherical particle distribution around the coordinate center .",
    "the possible asphericity depends on the number of spherical harmonics used for the potential expansion . in order to have better convergence , one - parameter basis functions for @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are used @xcite : @xmath15 the @xmath16 are called ultraspherical or gegenbauer polynomials .",
    "the spherical harmonics are given by the @xmath17 .",
    "once the @xmath18 for a certain set of particles are known , an analytic expression of the potential and the density is found . due to the truncation of the expansion",
    "they represent the mean field and mean density .",
    "this means that the force at each position and its derivative can be computed using the following expressions , @xmath19 since equations ( [ eq : gradphi ] ) and ( [ eq : dotgradphi ] ) lead to a significant modification of the scf scheme , we provide detailed form of these expressions in the appendix .",
    "as a first test for the new method , we have followed the last stages of an ongoing merger between two galaxies , each containing a supermassive black hole . for the initial setup , it is assumed that the stellar systems have already arranged themselves into a spherical system .",
    "the two , formerly central , supermassive black holes are moving through the stellar component with a speed on the order of the relative velocity between the two initial galaxies .    in the present simulations ,",
    "the stellar component is a realization of a plummer model .",
    "the density and potential of the spherically symmetric plummer model are given by @xcite : @xmath20 the quantity @xmath21 describes the total mass of the system and @xmath22 is the gravitational constant .",
    "with the plummer radius chosen to be @xmath23 , the half mass radius of this system is at a radius of @xmath24 in the model units of the simulations .",
    "the total mass of the system @xmath21 is set to unity .",
    "the gravitational constant @xmath22 is set to unity as well , conforming to the model units described by heggie & mathieu ( 1986 ) .",
    "the stellar system is centered around the origin .",
    "the black hole particles contain 1% of the system s total mass .",
    "their initial positions are at @xmath25 , and their initial velocities are 13.6% of the circular velocity at their initial radii .",
    "the black hole orbits are analyzed during the simulation assuming the orbit can be approximated by the classical two - body problem .",
    "the binding energies and eccentricities of the black hole orbits are computed from their relative distances and velocities , assuming a keplerian potential . once the black holes become bound",
    ", their two - body attraction is the most important force .",
    "the eccentricity of the binary @xmath26 and the binding energy @xmath27 are computed as follows , using the definition @xmath28 .",
    "the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the position vectors of the black holes @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from this",
    "it follows that @xcite , @xmath33 this method of analysis provides a sensitive measure for the moment when the black holes become bound to one other .",
    "furthermore , this way of analyzing the data also offers a precise tool for following the hardening of the binary .    since this sinking binary problem is the first application of eurostar ,",
    "its results are compared with those of the fully collisional code nbody6++ . for the comparison",
    "runs , 16384 particles were simulated .",
    "figure [ fig : esnb6bin - epshh ] shows the results for the two comparative runs .",
    "the plot on the left hand side in figure [ fig : esnb6bin - epshh ] shows the eccentricity of the binary as a function of the simulated time in model units .",
    "the plot on the right hand side shows the two - body binding energy as a function of time .",
    "the binary becomes bound after 10 time units , in both cases .",
    "the fully collisional method and the hybrid code eurostar show slightly different sinking rates for the binary at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "these differences result from the different density of collisional particles around the black holes in both codes . while the black holes in the fully collisional run suffer small angle encounters with every particle in the system , this is not possible in the hybrid code .",
    "naturally , all particles treated by the mean field method can only interact with the system through changes in the mean potential .",
    "after the binary has become bound , the hardening process is driven by the stars which have a small enough impact parameter such that they have an encounter timescale smaller than the orbital timescale of the massive binary .",
    "therefore , the hardening depends more on the two - body encounters with neighboring particles , which have large orbital velocities .    with increasing simulation time , the binary locks into an oscillating motion around the center of mass of the stellar component .",
    "this motion does not extend beyond of the dense galactic core . effectively , the differences in the density of the collisional particles between the two methods vanish after the binary has become bound .",
    "figure [ fig : esnb6bin - epshh ] reflects this by showing a parallel evolution of eccentricity and binding energy for times larger than 10 time units in the simulation .",
    "this new code is intended for raising the total particle number for collisional simulations of spherical @xmath0-body systems .",
    "hence the evolution of one , two or several massive bodies in a dense stellar cluster appears to be an ideal problem for eurostar .",
    "this is why we are addressing here the problem of a sinking massive black hole binary in galactic centers .",
    "another useful potential application os the dynamics of globular clusters .",
    "the particles representing the stellar component are distributed according to plummer s model with @xmath34 .",
    "the total mass of the stars is fixed at @xmath35 , while the black hole particles carry @xmath36 each , so @xmath37 .",
    "this is a fairly high mass for the black holes compared to the total mass of the stellar system , since ferrarese and merritt @xcite found the black hole mass in bulges to be smaller than that .",
    "however our simulations start at a situation resembling the final stage of a galactic merger , which means we are concentrating on the innermost part of the allready spherical system .",
    "the black hole particles are initially placed symmetrically about the center of mass of the stellar component .",
    "their initial radii are @xmath38 , their initial velocities are 13.6% of the circular velocity at this radius . in the given model units ,",
    "this represents starting points for the black holes at @xmath25 and @xmath39 .",
    "the center of mass of the stellar component is at the origin .",
    "the mass factor between a stellar particle and a black hole particle is : @xmath40 for 131072 particles , @xmath41 for 65536 particles , and @xmath42 for 32768 particles .    in order to have a statistical basis for analysis",
    ", we compare the results from five runs with 32768 particles , two runs with 65536 particles , and three runs with 131072 particles .",
    "not all runs reached the @xmath43 time unit mark due to time step scheduling problems caused by accuracy problems in very close encounters between stars and a black hole particle .",
    "the regularization methods implemented in eurostar are identical to the ones suitable for open or globular cluster simulations .",
    "the extreme situation in the late stages of the sinking binary black hole problem may cause the chain algorithm to fail @xcite .",
    "this problem can be solved by applying different regularization methods . however , up to the point of failure , the simulations conserved the total energy with relative errors below @xmath44 . in all runs ,",
    "the binary becomes bound at approximately @xmath45 time units .",
    "the parameters of the hybrid code have been adjusted in the following way : the scf part uses the parameter @xmath46 for the basis functions . with this choice ,",
    "the basis functions represent a plummer model to zeroth order , which is in accordance with the models used by @xcite .",
    "also , this choice ensures an optimal representation of the actual potential by the expansion method . to allow flexibility in the expansion",
    ", seven basis functions are used for the radial direction and five ( @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 $ ] ) for the angular expansions .",
    "the nbody6++ part uses @xmath49 for the irregular time steps and @xmath50 for the regular time steps .",
    "furthermore , the ahmad - cohen neighbor scheme @xcite has been modified in such a way that the search radius for neighbors is enhanced by a factor of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for interactions with the black holes in the runs with 32768 , 65536 , and 131072 particles respectively .",
    ".number of sample points in the bins used for analyzing the motion of the binary .",
    "the bins for the evolution time @xmath54 in @xmath0-body units are centered around @xmath55 .",
    "plots using bins for the total particle number @xmath56 have the number of sample points given in the row labeled `` total '' . [ cols= \" > ,",
    "> , > , > , > \" , ]     this means we find a center of mass motion for the binary which exceeds the expected value from brownian motion .",
    "however , the motion is enhanced by larger factors than proposed by @xcite or by @xcite . a more detailed discussion of this result remains for future work .",
    "following @xcite , dynamical friction becomes inefficient as the driving forces behind the binary black hole orbit decay after it becomes hard . in order to put constraints on this",
    ", we estimate the influence of dynamical friction on the decay of the binary in the simulation . from @xcite ,",
    "we take the following expression , which is derived in @xcite .",
    "@xmath57 equation ( [ eq : dynbinney ] ) describes the deceleration of a particle with mass @xmath58 under the influence of weak encounters with surrounding particles having a uniform mass @xmath59 . in the special case of a plummer model , the integral in equation ( [ eq : dynbinney ] )",
    "can be expressed in terms of the escape velocity @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 the quantity @xmath62 defines the number density of the stars at the position @xmath63 and @xmath64 . taking the limit of a continuous system with @xmath65 ,",
    "the term @xmath66 becomes @xmath67 .",
    "the integral over @xmath68 in equation ( [ eq : myplum ] ) can then be solved in a closed form .    if the motion of the black holes is determined by their self interaction plus a frictional force term , this friction can be linked to the decay of the angular momentum @xmath69 as follows : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the radial acceleration of the two body motion of the black holes , @xmath72 is the dynamical friction acting on each black hole , and @xmath73 is the two - body velocity of the black holes . with equations ( [ eq : dynbinney ] ) and ( [ eq : myplum ] ) we can evaluate the impact of dynamical friction on the orbital angular momentum according to @xmath74 the gravitational constant @xmath22 is unity in our model units , and the black holes have mass @xmath75 each .",
    "we use the mean orbital velocities for @xmath76 . in order to evaluate @xmath77",
    ", we use the mean separation of the black holes for @xmath78 , which introduces only a very small error in a plummer model . assuming a linear behavior for @xmath79 , we find @xmath80 .",
    "using this to estimate the angular momentum from the slopes @xmath32 of the linear fits in figure [ fig : llalltime ] , we find @xmath81 .",
    "this result shows that the usual assumption of large @xmath82 does not hold .",
    "both the possibility of a linear fit for the evolution of @xmath69 and the small hardening rate @xmath83 indicate that mainly dynamical friction causes the shrinking of black hole orbits in our simulations .",
    "as stated before , the collisional simulations which include black hole particles do not reach the observed mass contrast in galactic nuclei . in order to transform simulation units to physical units , a system size in parsec or a stellar mass in units of solar mass has to be chosen . setting the gravitational constant @xmath22 ,",
    "all remaining units can be rescaled @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "a run with 65536 particles is scaled to a physical stellar system .",
    "since this work focuses on the dynamics of galactic nuclei , the physical mass of the supermassive objects motivates the following choices , @xmath84 the masses are chosen so that the total mass of the system is @xmath85 and the mean mass of a particle is @xmath86 .",
    "this choice means that every stellar particle with mass @xmath59 represents a compact star cluster with the order of @xmath5 particles .",
    "the chosen mass for the black hole particle has approximately the same mass as the central black hole of m31 @xcite .",
    "the conversion between physical units and @xmath0-body units follows @xmath87 for simulated quantities . by choosing the central velocity dispersion to be @xmath88 , we find @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 in a plummer model , the half mass radius @xmath92 is related to the plummer radius @xmath93 by @xmath94 @xcite . since @xmath95 ,",
    "the half mass radius in model units is @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the initial model for the simulated decay of a black hole in the galactic center is a plummer sphere with a half mass radius of 272.23 pc .",
    "the initial distance between the black holes is 355.39 pc .",
    "they become bound after approximately 40 million years .",
    "the total simulated time is approximately 190 million years . at the end of the simulation the black hole distances vary from 1 pc at apocenter to 0.2 pc at pericenter .",
    "the semi - major axis of the first bound orbit is 21 pc .",
    "this scaling allows us to compare our results with @xcite .",
    "we find that our smallest average orbits at the end of the simulation are not yet small enough that gravitational radiation , according to their estimates , would dominate the evolution time scale .",
    "however , at the end of our simulations evolution is still dominated by dynamical friction and not by long evolution time scales for hard binaries as proposed by @xcite .",
    "their estimate for the gravitational radiation shrinking time scale assumes circular orbits for the binary . with eccentricities of roughly 0.85 for the black hole binaries in our runs",
    ", we expect gravitational radiation to be efficient and coalescence in roughly @xmath97 years after our simulations stopped .",
    "we have created a new @xmath0-body hybrid code by merging a high accuracy direct hermite integrator of the standard type @xcite with a collisionless @xmath0-body method which approximates the potential of a given particle distribution by a series expansion @xcite .",
    "the scf method has been completely rewritten to include a computation of the time derivative of the gravitational force and a fourth order hermite integrator .",
    "we have used this code to model a galactic nucleus containing two massive black holes with up to 128k single particles .",
    "the evolution of the binary black hole is followed from an initial phase , to a phase driven by standard dynamical friction where the binary is bound , and then further hardened by three - body encounters with single stars . in that hardening phase , we take full advantage of the regularized three - body integration developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the method proves to work well , and reproduces standard expectations , such as the chandrasekhar dynamical friction in the initial phase . in the final hardening phase due to",
    "three - body encounters , we find that the eccentricity of the black hole binary maintains a fairly large value ( around 0.85 ) .",
    "this is very interesting because it decreases the time scale for gravitational radiation merger of binary black holes dramatically , thus increasing our chances of detecting gravitational radiation from such events with lisa .",
    "due to computational limitations , however , our particle numbers are still not large enough to fully describe the real physical situation .",
    "any further scaling is problematic , and so further work with improved hardware and software must be done .",
    "we study in detail the motion of a black hole binary in the center of a galaxy .",
    "we find that the wandering motion does not decay with increasing particle number as expected .",
    "the mechanism exciting these anomalous motions is unclear .",
    "if they exist in simulations with realistic particle numbers , they will solve the problem of feeding the black holes with fresh stellar dynamical material raised by @xcite .",
