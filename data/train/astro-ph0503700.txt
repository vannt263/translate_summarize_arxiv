    "we can not rule out the possibility that src 11a is less absorbed than src 11b and r1 because it is a foreground source ( e.g. , associated with the snr g189.6 + 3.3 ) .",
    "a more plausible interpretation is that src 11a , src 11b , and r1 are physically connected , since a chance probability to find two sources with 210 kev fluxes above @xmath37 @xmath5 ( and similar photon indices ) within a @xmath38 radius circle in the anti - centre direction is well below 10@xmath39 .",
    "if we assume that src 11a , src 11b and r1 are at the same distance and fix the column density at @xmath22  = 0.7 , the power - law model gives acceptable fits for src 11b and r1 , but we have to add an additional soft component for src 11a ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "results of such fits , with the additional _ mekal _ ( optically thin thermal plasma emission ) component for src 11a , are presented in table 1 .",
    "such a component is expected if the source is a supersonic ejecta fragment ( see  3 ) .",
    "a satisfactory fit can also be obtained if we use a blackbody component , instead of _",
    "mekal_. such a blackbody + power - law fit , with a temperature of @xmath00.1 kev , radius of @xmath03 km , and power - law index of @xmath40 ( at fixed @xmath41 ) can be interpreted as a combination of thermal emission from the surface of a neutron star plus nonthermal emission from the neutron star magnetosphere and/or surrounding pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the extrapolation of the hard nonthermal spectrum of src 11 ( see table 1 ) into the egret range predicts a photon flux similar to that of 3eg j0617 + 2238 , whose position is marginally compatible with that of src 11 .",
    "such a @xmath3-ray luminosity can be expected for both the fragment and pwn interpretations .",
    "the analysis presented above reveals the complex structure of src 11 , projected onto the region where ic  443 interacts with a molecular cloud . below",
    "we discuss possible identifications of src 11 with two classes of x - ray objects relevant to snrs : pwne and isolated ejecta fragments .",
    "the x - ray source 1sax j0617.1 + 2221 in the ic  443 field has been identified by olbert et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and bocchino & bykov ( 2001 ) as a likely pwn .",
    "x - ray - radio morphology and the x - ray spectral steepening toward the outer parts of the nebula support this identification .",
    "recently , leahy ( 2004 ) speculated that this pwn is associated with another snr , g189.6 + 3.3 , rather than ic  443 .",
    "the possible presence of two snrs in the field makes it possible that src 11 might also be a low - luminosity ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath43 at 1.5 kpc ) pwn , possibly powered by a pulsar in src 11a that shows a soft thermal - like spectral component .",
    "the size ( @xmath44 pc ) , the hard spectrum , and the presence of compact clumps are in agreement with this hypothesis .",
    "we found no evidence of spectral steepening in the outskirts of src 11 ; however , the count statistics is scarce , and no substantial synchrotron burning is expected in a low radiative efficiency pwn .",
    "the complex morphology of src 11 is rather different from that observed in the 1sax j0617.1 + 2221 pwn .",
    "however , if src 11 is indeed inside a molecular cloud , then the pwn appearance can be different from that inside a hot rarefied snr gas , and , in fact , many pwne show rather complex morphology in high - resolution images .    another possible class of compact hard x - ray sources related to snrs",
    "are isolated `` knots '' associated with fast moving ejecta fragments .",
    "a prototype of such objects was observed in the vela snr ( aschenbach et al.1995 ; miyata et al .",
    "a massive individual fragment moving supersonically through a molecular cloud would have a luminosity @xmath45 10@xmath46 in a 110 kev band and would be observable with  and  from a few kpc distance .",
    "the model of fast supernova fragments predicts two x - ray emission components ( bykov 2003 ) .",
    "the first one is thermal x - ray emission from a hot shocked ambient gas behind the fragment bow shock , with the spectrum of an optically thin thermal shocked plasma of an ism cloud abundance .",
    "a ballistically moving isolated fragment near the boundary of a snr of age @xmath47 would have a velocity @xmath48 .",
    "for the assumed distance to ic  443 of 1.5 kpc and the age @xmath49 kyr suggested by chevalier ( 1999 ) , this estimate gives @xmath50 250 @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding post - shock gas temperature is about 0.1 kev , for a standard estimate @xmath52 .",
    "however , given the uncertainties in the snr distance and age ( e.g. , leahy 2004 suggested that ic  443 is much younger than 30 kyr ) , post - shock temperatures of about 0.3 kev might be expected as well .",
    "therefore , our detection of the putative thermal component in the spectrum of src 11a is in agreement with this interpretation .",
    "the second emission component is nonthermal .",
    "interaction of the fast electrons ( accelerated at the fragment bow - shock ) with the fragment body produces both hard continuum and x - ray and ir line emission , including the k - shell lines of si and fe ( bykov 2002 ) .",
    "we apply the model for x - ray emission from an ejecta fragment of a 0.2 pc size ( @xmath53 at 1.5 kpc , the current size of the fragment ) and a mass of @xmath54 , interacting with a molecular cloud ( see bykov 2002 , 2003 ) . the knot travels through an inter - clump medium of a number density @xmath55 with a velocity of @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath57 0.3 kev ) .",
    "this model predicts a hard continuum with a photon index @xmath58 and a normalization consistent with the observed one ( see table 1 ) . the upper limit on the 1.8 kev si line flux from the _ chandra _ observation is close to the upper limit @xmath59 ph @xmath33 s@xmath43 obtained by bb03 with .",
    "to detect or meaningfully constrain the k - shell emission lines of si and fe at the level of @xmath60 ph @xmath33 s@xmath43 , expected for a fragment of src 11 size and velocity , a longer   exposure is required .",
    "the si line would be more suitable for constraining the nature of src 11 than the fe line because acis is more sensitive around 1.8 kev , and the si line from ic 443 is not absorbed by the ism , contrary to the case of snrs in the galactic center region discussed by bykov ( 2003 ) .",
    "note that to reach its apparent position in the molecular cloud , src 11 must be massive enough , @xmath54 , to overcome strong drag deceleration in the dense matter .",
    "the probability of another similarly massive ejecta fragment getting in the acis field of view is small .",
    "some of the point - like x - ray sources seen in the cloud and its vicinity could be smaller and less massive , @xmath61 , fragments with luminosities @xmath62 10@xmath46 that are expected to be more numerous . to firmly identify the sources as the fragments , a much deeper observation is required .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations available ( klein , mckee , & colella 1994 ; wang & chevalier 2002 ) predict a complex irregular structure of the fragment body due to the hydrodynamic instabilities . in this case",
    "the x - ray image would show an irregular patchy structure , instead of the smooth regular head - tail structure .",
    "the patches are due to the emission of dense pieces of the fragmented knot illuminated by the shock - accelerated energetic particles .",
    "the bright clumps of a few arcsecond size in src 11 , such as src 11a and src 11b , can be explained in that model .",
    "thus , the morphology , spectra , and x - ray luminosity of are generally consistent with those expected for a ballistically moving fragment interacting with a molecular cloud .",
    "if confirmed with a deeper exposure , this would provide the first direct evidence of the potentially important class of hard x - ray sources .",
    "analysis of ir spectra of src 11 could help to distinguish between a massive ejecta fragment and a pwn .",
    "the fragments should be rather numerous in younger snrs in dense environments ( bykov 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , sources similar to src 11 can substantially contribute to the unusually rich population of hard x - ray sources in the galactic center region observed with  ( muno et al .",
    "2003 ) . on the other hand , a reliable identification of src 11 with a pwn , e.g. with high resolution radio observations of src 11 , will be the best test to confirm the reality of the currently putative snr g189.6 + 3.3 .",
