    "almost two decades ago , we discovered rapid and permanent changes of vector magnetic fields associated with flares @xcite .",
    "specifically , the transverse field near the flaring magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) is found to enhance substantially and irreversibly across the time duration of the flare , which is also often accompanied by an increase of magnetic shear .",
    "similar trend indicating a more horizontal orientation of the photospheric magnetic field after flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) has continued to be observed later on in many observations @xcite , and shows some agreement with recent model predictions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a majority of such studies are unavoidably hampered by the obvious limitations , ground - based observations ( e.g. , seeing variation and the limited number of observing spectral positions ) , probably because of which mixed results were also reported @xcite .    on the other hand , flare - related variations in the line - of - sight ( los ) component of photospheric magnetic field have been clearly recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , the feature of unbalanced flux evolution of the opposite polarities could provide an indirect evidence for the more horizontal orientation of photospheric fields after flares / cmes @xcite .",
    "however , it is noted that the changes of the los field alone can not provide complete understanding of the field restructuring @xcite .",
    "it is notable that vector magnetic field data has been made available with the helioseismic and magnetic imager  ( hmi ) instrument @xcite on board the newly launched _ solar dynamics observatory _  ( _ sdo _ ) .",
    "its unprecedented observing capabilities give a favorable opportunity to finally resolve any uncertainties regarding the evolution of photospheric magnetic field in relation to flares / cmes .    in this study",
    ", we investigate a near disk - center x2.2 flare on 2011 february 15 , which provides the first solid evidence of the enhancement in the horizontal field at the flaring pil using the seeing - free hmi data .",
    "we will discuss the implications of such a change in the context of magnetic reconnection model for flares .",

    "only ar11158 processed data have been released by the hmi team @xcite . for our study",
    ", we use the product of vector magnetograms projected and remapped to heliographic coordinates , with a spatial resolution of @xmath01  and a cadence of 12 minutes .",
    "the temporal and spatial relationship between the change of the photospheric fields and flare energy release can provide important clues concerning the eruption mechanism .",
    "the evolution of the flare hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission was entirely registered by the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _  ( _ rhessi _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "pixon images @xcite in the 35100  kev energy range showing the flare footpoints were reconstructed using the front segments of detectors 28 with 1632  s integration time throughout the event . to provide the chromospheric and coronal context , we also used h@xmath2  images taken by the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ? * ) on board _ hinode _ , and euv images made by the atmospheric imaging assembly  ( aia ; * ? ? ? * ) on board _",
    "the @xmath3 region noaa 11158 was located close to the disk center ( s21@xmath1 , w21@xmath1 ) when the 2011 february 15 x2.2 flare started at 01:44  ut , peaked at 01:56  ut , and ended at 02:06  ut in _ goes _  18    flux .",
    "the flare was initiated at the center of the active region , where opposite magnetic flux concentrations underwent a counterclockwise rotation - like motion possibly resulting in highly sheared fields along the pil @xcite . by monitoring the evolution of horizontal field , a compact region r along the pil ( enclosed by",
    "the white bordered line ) is readily identified to show a pronounced enhancement of horizontal field strength @xmath4 after the flare ( cf",
    ". figures  [ f1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "close temporal association of this field change with flare emissions and its permanence relative to the flare duration are demonstrated in figure  [ f2](a ) covering a period spanning 10 hrs , in which we find that @xmath5 at the region r increases by @xmath030% from @xmath01300  g to @xmath01700  g in @xmath030 minutes .",
    "this rapid evolution ensues from the beginning of the flare at 01:44  ut , with the change - over time cotemporal with the rapid rising of soft x - ray flux and peaking of hxr emissions . to further characterize the properties of magnetic field , we calculate magnetic shear @xmath6 , weighted shear angle @xmath7 , and magnetic inclination angle @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath6 is defined as the product of field strength and shear angle @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the subscript @xmath12 represents the potential field .",
    "the weighted shear angle of a region of interest with n pixels is then @xmath13 , where i=1,2, ... n .",
    "the inclination angle @xmath8 relative to the horizontal plane is @xmath14 . from the results shown in figures  [ f2](b)(d )",
    ", it can be clearly seen that all of @xmath15 , @xmath7 , and @xmath16 exhibit an abrupt change in the field strength , inclination angle , and azimuthal angle by about 400  g  radian , 7@xmath1 , and @xmath17 , respectively , within the same transition time as @xmath5 upon the flare occurrence .",
    "please note that in order to demonstrate that the rapid changes are very significant compared to variations seen in the long - term evolution , we plot the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) as error bars in figure  [ f2 ] , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is derived from the linear fit of the temporal evolution of each quantity in the preflare ( postflare ) state .",
    "corroborating our previous studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the above rapid developments evidenced by the unambiguous hmi observation strongly suggest a more horizontal and sheared state of the photospheric magnetic field at the region r after the flare .",
    "we note that although the increase of @xmath6 and @xmath7 seems contrary to the relaxation of nonpotentiality as required to energize eruptions , it has been demonstrated using field extrapolations that the increase is localized and both @xmath6 and @xmath7 decrease above a certain height @xcite .",
    "the magnetic free energy in the 3-d volume is reduced after the flare .    on the spatial relationship between the field change and flare emissions",
    ", the region r lies between the earliest conjugate hxr footpoint sources at @xmath001:49  ut ( figure  [ f1](c ) ) and the ends of the double j - shaped flare ribbons ( figure  [ f1](d ) ) .",
    "intriguingly , aia 94    images show two extra footpoint - like flare brightenings fp3 and fp4 at the two far ends of the flaring pil ( figure  [ f1](e ) ) .",
    "co - spatial hxr emissions at fp3 and fp4 were observed few minutes later ( figure  [ f1](f ) ) , and the motion of hxr footpoints as well as the evolution of chromospheric ribbons generally proceed in such a manner as to reduce the magnetic shear , along the pil ( illustrated by the arrows in figure  [ f1](f ) ) as reported in eruptive sigmoids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these lead us to a picture as we schematically illustrate in figure  [ f3 ] , where the flare could be triggered by the tether - cutting reconnection @xcite between the two sets of sigmoidal loops fp3fp2 and fp4fp1 as clearly discernible in euv images , which results in the j - shaped flare ribbons ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the reconnected large - scale fields fp3fp4 could erupt outward to become the halo cme associated with this flare , and the newly formed smaller loops fp1fp2 lying close to the surface could then account for the enhanced @xmath22 at the region r. such a reconnection of two current - carrying loops would also effectively lead the current path to move downward closer to the surface , which can explain the increase of @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "increase of the magnetic nonpotentiality at and near the surface could result from the newly emerging , sheared magnetic flux @xcite , which could occur after the relaxation of fields above the surface due to the flare energy release .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the region r at the pil is between flare ribbons / kernels at opposite polarities , hence the observed field changes can not be attributed to flare emissions @xcite .",
    "detailed investigation of the flare hxr emission in further relation to the coronal field dynamics is out of the scope of the current study and will be presented in a subsequent publication .",
    "we have used the unprecedented sdo / hmi vector field observations to analyze the changes of the photospheric magnetic field associated with the first x - class flare in the solar cycle 24 , with the aid of images of flare emissions in multiple wavelengths .",
    "main results are as follows .    1 .",
    "a compact region r along the flaring pil shows a rapid and permanent enhancement of @xmath5 by 400  g ( @xmath030% of the preflare magnitude ) within about 30  minutes , which has a close temporal relationship with the flare hxr emission .",
    "meanwhile , the nonpotentiality represented by magnetic shear also exhibits a pronounced increase near the surface .",
    "2 .   the initial hxr sources fp1 and fp2 as well as the double j - shaped flare ribbons are at the two ends of the region r lying at the central of this sigmoidal active region .",
    "two additional flare footpoints fp3 and fp4 are clearly seen in the hot 94    channel , located at the far ends of the sigmoid .",
    "we suggest that the tether - cutting reconnection @xcite between the loops fp3fp2 and fp4fp1 produces the short and low - lying loops fp1fp2 , which could explain the enhanced @xmath22 as well as @xmath6 and @xmath7 at the region r @xcite .",
    "the detected enhancement of nonpotentiality on the surface could also be due to the newly emerging , sheared fields @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the hmi observations presented in this study constitute the first solid evidence of flare - induced changes of the photospheric magnetic field , which strongly endorses our previous results using ground - based vector magnetograms subject to seeing variation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the unambiguously observed enhancement of horizontal field on the surface strongly suggests that the photospheric magnetic field could respond to the coronal field restructuring by tilting toward the surface ( i.e. , toward a more horizontal state ) near the pil , and that this development may be due to the tether - cutting reconnection producing the flare .",
    "this view is also well in line with the recent theoretical development @xcite , where the back reaction on the solar surface resulting from the coronal field evolution as required by the energy release is quantitatively assessed .",
    "further systematic studies of flare - related magnetic field change , especially when aided with extrapolation models , are promising to provide further insight into the relationship between the surface field change and coronal magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
