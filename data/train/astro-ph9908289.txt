    "the planck satellite is designed to measure temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with a precision of @xmath1 , and angular resolution of about 5 arcminutes .",
    "the payload consists of a 1.5 - 2.0 m gregorian telescope which feeds two instruments : the high frequency instrument ( hfi ) with 56 bolometer arrays operated at @xmath2 and frequencies of @xmath3ghz and the low frequency instrument ( lfi ) with 56 tuned radio receivers arrays operated at @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and frequencies of @xmath6 ghz ( see http://astro.estec.esa.nl/sa-general/projects/planck/ for more information ) .",
    "data on board planck consist of @xmath7 differential temperature measurements , spanning a range of values we shall call @xmath8 . preliminary studies and telemetry allocation indicate the need for compressing these data by a ratio of @xmath9 . here",
    "we will consider under what conditions it might be possible to achieve such a large compression factor .",
    "a discretized data set can be represented by a number of bits , @xmath10 , which for linear analogue - to - digital converters ( adc ) is typically given by the maximum range @xmath11 : @xmath12 . if we express the joint probability for a set of n measurements as @xmath13 , we have that the shannon entropy per component of the data set is :    h - 1 _ i_1 ,  , i_n p_i_1 ,  , i_n _ 2(p_i_1 ,  , i_n ) .",
    "[ h ] shannon s theorem states that @xmath14 is a lower bound to the average length of the code units .",
    "we will therefore define the theoretical ( optimal ) compression rate as c_r , opt [ cr ] for a uniform distribution of @xmath7 measurements we have @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which equals the number of bits per data .",
    "thus : it is not possible to compress a ( uniformly ) random distribution of measurements .",
    "gaztaaga ( 1998 ) , have argued that a _ well calibrated signal _ will be dominated by thermal ( white ) noise in the instrument : @xmath17 and therefore suggested that the digital resolution @xmath18 only needs to be as small as the instrumental rms white noise : @xmath19 .",
    "the nominal @xmath20 pixel sensitivity will only be achieved after averaging ( on earth ) .",
    "this yields compression rates of @xmath21 . on the other hand maris ( 1999 )",
    "have used the same formalism as gaztanaga but fixing the final dynamical range @xmath8 to some fiducial values , so that the digital resolution is then given by @xmath22 , independently of @xmath23 . again , assuming a well calibrated signal dominated by thermal ( white ) noise , this approach yields smaller compression rates of @xmath24 , as it is obvious from the fact that the digital resolution is larger ( @xmath18 is smaller ) . in both cases ,",
    "the effect of the cmb signal ( eg dipole ) and other sources ( such as the galaxy ) have been ignored .",
    "several questions arise from these studies . what is the optimal value of @xmath18 and what are the penalties ( distortions ) involved when using large values of @xmath18 ? moreover , can the data gathered by the on board instruments be really modeled as a white noise signal ? in other words , are the departures from gaussianity ( due to the galactic , foregrounds , dipole and cmb signals ) important ?",
    "this latter question is closely related to the way data will be processed ( and calibrated ) on board , for example : if and how the dipole is going to be used for calibration .",
    "these issues together with the final instrument specifications seem to play an important role on the final range of values @xmath8 and , therefore , the possible compression rates .",
    "this is somehow unfortunate as compression would then be related in a rather complicated way to the nature of the external signal and also to critical issues of the internal data processing issues .",
    "here we shall present a simple way of coding the on board data that will solve the lossless compression problem in a much simpler way .",
    "this will be done independently of the internal calibration or the nature of the external signal ( cmb or otherwise ) .",
    "we will also address the issue of the digital distortion introduced ( the penalty ) as a function of the final compression ( the prize ) .    in section ",
    "2 we give a summary of some critical issues related to the on - board data .",
    "our coding and compression proposals are presented in  3 , while simulations are dicussed in  4 .",
    "we end up with some concluding remarks .",
    "parameters for the radiometers : a ) central frequency @xmath25 ( bandwidth is 20% ) ; b ) angular resolution ( beam fwhm ) ; c ) rms thermal noise expected at 6.9 ms ( 144.9 hz ) sampling ; d ) range of temperatures expected from the sky ( jupiter , dipole , s - z ) ; e ) number of detectors ( 2x horns ) ; f ) total data rate at 6.9 ms ( 2.5 arcmin ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can model the process of differencing as the subtraction of two gaussian random variables : @xmath26 and @xmath27 with variances @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the probability density distribution for the difference random variable @xmath30 is also a gaussian distribution with a new variance @xmath31 : @xmath32 for a wide sense stationary process @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "one can obtain also in this way the expression for the entropy of the distribution , @xmath35 we want to take differences of data separated by @xmath36 minute , which corresponds to the same sky position .",
    "bearing in mind that our model is a first order markov process @xmath37 will be equal to the correlation between pixels separated 1 min .",
    ", that is @xmath38 ( recall that the correlation matrix for a wide sense stationary stochastic process is a symmetric toeplitz matrix and so it depends only on index differences ) .",
    "thus the two - point correlation is : @xmath39 next , we are going to estimate this correlation for a power spectrum @xmath40 of the type of white noise plus @xmath41 ( i.e. @xmath40 in eq.[[pk ] ] ) . in practice",
    "our spectrum will not run over the whole range but only over a limited interval @xmath42 .",
    "the final result , for @xmath43 , is : @xmath44_{f = f_{min}}^{f = f_{max}}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 we want to know if correlation due to @xmath41 noise is important in our data handling model , so let us calculate some specific examples . in our model @xmath46",
    "is given by the inverse of the sampling rate and @xmath47 is the inverse of two hours ( if calibration occurs at every pointing ) or the inverse of the mission s time ( about 1 year ) . in the table [ table :",
    "rho ] we have computed the magnitude of @xmath37 for our model and for two different values of the calibration time , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "we can see in the table how small the values of @xmath37 are compared to unity .",
    "given the precision needed for the entropy and compression factors , such contributions of @xmath37 to @xmath49 are neglegible ."
