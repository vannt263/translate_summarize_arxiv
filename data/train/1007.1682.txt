    "atomic - scale magnetic structures on surfaces @xcite are of current interest for several reasons .",
    "primarily , they display intriguing physical properties in their own right . magnetic atoms on surfaces , simple or complex , can display large magnetocrystalline anisotropy which differs from the bulk .",
    "the spin can be large , or quenched by electronic effects such as the kondo effect . and coupling between spins can be via direct overlap , rkky or superexchange .",
    "secondarily , these systems are compelling because of their parallels with other nano - scale systems  quantum dots , magnetic multilayers , magnetic impurities in thin films , to name just a few .",
    "finally , there are the possible applications to nano - scale magnetic bits and future magnetic devices .",
    "a large net spin and magnetic anisotropy are required for atomic - scale magnetic structures to be used as practical nano - scale magnetic bits .",
    "a possible way to obtain a large magnetic moment is through a ferromagnetic coupling between transition metal atoms .",
    "however , ferromagnetic coupling is rare in transition metal complexes , @xcite that is , when the transition metal atom is bonded to a nonmetallic atom .",
    "we describe below our studies of such a system .    in a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm )",
    "measurement @xcite of a ti atom placed on a cu@xmath0n / cu(100 ) surface , it was found that the ti exhibits very different magnetic properties than in gas phase . in the following work ,",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) to study the atomic spin of a single ti atom , and exchange coupling of a dimer of ti atoms , placed on a single layer of cu@xmath0n on a cu(100 ) surface .",
    "the cu@xmath0n layer is used as an insulating layer to isolate the spin of a magnetic adatom from the metal electrons of the cu(100 ) surface @xcite .",
    "hereafter , the cu@xmath0n / cu(100 ) surface will be referred to as the cun surface .",
    "we study exchange coupling between ti atoms in two different environments : ( i ) a square lattice of ti on the cun surface and ( ii ) a dimer of ti atoms deposited on the cun surface .",
    "we use spin - polarized dft , as implemented in quantum - espresso @xcite , within a pseudopotential formalism using a plane wave basis with a cut - off of 30 ry . a higher cut - off of 240 ry was used for the augmentation charges introduced by the ultrasoft pseudopotential @xcite .",
    "we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange correlation interaction with the functional proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof .",
    "@xcite an on - site coulomb interaction ( u ) for ti was employed , with @xmath1 taken to be 4.7 ev as calculated using a constraint - gga method @xcite . to improve the convergence , a gaussian smearing of width 0.01",
    "ry was adopted .",
    "brillouin zone integrations for the ( @xmath2 ) surface cell of cu(100 ) were carried out using a ( @xmath3 ) mesh of @xmath4-points .",
    "we obtained the bulk lattice parameter for cu as 3.67  , which compares well with the experimental value of 3.61 @xcite . to simulate the cun surface",
    ", we use a symmetric slab of three to five atomic layers of cu , with a layer of cun above and below .",
    "periodic images of the slab were separated by a vacuum of 15   along the z @xmath5 $ ] direction .",
    "the top view of the cun surface is shown in fig .",
    "[ cun - strct - charge]a .",
    "the unit cell of the cun surface ( shown by the black square ) consists of two cu atoms and one n atom .",
    "we find that the n atoms are 0.18    above the top cu atoms in a fully relaxed structure .",
    "the distance between the first and second layers of cu is 1.97   which compares well with the all - electron result of 1.91   @xcite .",
    "we find that each cu atom in the surface unit cell loses 0.7 electrons to the n ( presumably due to the electronegative nature of n ) .",
    "thus , cu and n atoms form a square network of dipoles on the surface , rendering a ( nominally ) insulating character to the surface . as shown in fig.[cun - strct - charge]a , along the x - axis , two surface cu atoms are separated by a hollow site and along the y - axis , they are separated by a n - atom .",
    "these directions will be referred as hollow - axis and n - axis , respectively .",
    "the charge density of the cun surface along the n- and hollow - axis is shown in fig.[cun - strct - charge](b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "notice that along the n - axis , charge gets accumulated in the top layer .    )",
    "unit cell of the cun surface . along the x - axis",
    ", surface cu atoms are separated by a hollow site ( it is marked by ` h ' ) and along the y - axis , they are separated by a n atom .",
    "side views of charge density produced by a cut along the ( b ) n - axis and ( c ) hollow - axis.,width=317 ]",
    "to calculate the spin of ti on the cun surface , a ti atom is deposited on top of a cu atom , following the stm experiments @xcite . at one monolayer coverage of ti ,",
    "the ( @xmath6 ) surface unit cell consists of one n atom , one ti atom and two cu atoms as shown in fig.[cun - strct - charge]a . a constrained - gga @xcite calculation @xcite yields @xmath7 ev for ti in this configuration .",
    "however , the value of @xmath1 for ti would presumably be different at lower coverages of ti . in order to understand the effect of u on the spin of ti",
    ", we do calculations for a range of values of @xmath1 for the ( @xmath6 ) unit cell .",
    "the results for distances between ti and its nearest neighbor atoms in the surface , angle subtended by ti - n - ti , and the spin of ti are shown in table [ structure ] .",
    "we find that ti - n and ti - cu distances increase as @xmath1 increases , with the net effect of a rising ti and decreasing ( becoming sharper ) ti - n - ti angle .",
    "most importantly , as u increases the spin of ti approaches that of the gas phase value of 1 .    as an added complexity",
    ", we find that the initial magnetization of ti affects the final calculated ground state , indicating a complex energy minimization landscape .",
    "hence we try several initial magnetizations and take the final state corresponding to the lowest energy . for u=4.7",
    ", we show the data corresponding to two such optimized structures ( s - i and s - ii ) obtained by varying the initial magnetization ( see table [ structure ] ) .",
    "the optimized structure corresponding to s - i is the lowest energy structure ( s - i is lower in energy than s - ii by 0.3 ev ) , showing the spin of ti to be 0.75 , indicating possible mixed valent behavior for a monolayer of ti .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we have drawn conclusions so far about ti - ti coupling based on the calculations in lattices , where the situation is more complicated because one not only has the nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions but also has next nn ( nnn ) interactions and so on . to simulate a ti - ti dimer on the surface we use a larger unit cell of ( @xmath8 ) with two and three lattice units along the hollow- and n - axis respectively .",
    "interestingly , we find ferromagnetic coupling along the n - axis and antiferromagnetic along the hollow - axis , the same ground states as for the case of ( @xmath6 ) lattices . along the n - axis , the energy difference ( @xmath9 ) is -16.5 mev compared to -16.1 mev for the ( @xmath6 ) case . along the hollow - axis",
    "the energy difference is 143.9 mev compared to 106.8 mev for the ( @xmath6 ) case .",
    "thus , a ti lattice and a dimer show a similar trend and strength of coupling .",
    "it confirms our assumption of primarily nearest neighbor interactions in a ti lattice on the cun surface .",
    "notice that the distance between ti and the cu atom below it is 2.56   for both the ( @xmath6 ) case , and the ( @xmath8 ) case for coupling along the hollow - axis .",
    "however , when the dimer is placed along the n - axis the distance between ti and the cu below it increases slightly to 2.65  .",
    "the ti - n - ti angle is 135.6 degrees for the ( @xmath6 ) case which is close to 142.9 degrees for the ( @xmath8 ) case .    in fig .",
    "[ spin - dimer ] , we plot the spin density for the ti dimer along the n - axis ( fig.[spin - dimer]a ) and the hollow - axis ( fig.[spin - dimer]b ) . a significant amount of induced spin - polarization around the n atom can be seen from the figure .",
    "ferromagnetic coupling between ti atoms along the n - axis is established by having an opposite spin n atom both between the ti atoms and at opposite ends . for anti - aligned spin configuration along the n - axis , the n atom becomes a single - atom antiferromagnet with a net spin of zero .",
    "along the hollow - axis , when spin on both the ti atoms is aligned , a dramatic anisotropy in the spin polarization of the ti develops , with a direct overlap established over the hollow site ( fig.[spin - dimer]b ) .",
    "the stretching of the ti bonds in this case case is striking , and suggestive that higher symmetry considerations may be coming into play .",
    "however , when spins are antialigned , no such elongation of spin polarization occurs . in both the cases ,",
    "n atoms on the sides of the two ti atoms develop a spin polarization opposite to that of the ti .",
    "the primary sources of exchange coupling between the ti atoms are superexchange @xcite , rkky @xcite , and direct overlap / direct exchange @xcite .",
    "the coupling between the adatoms can be direct , if the wave functions should overlap , or rkky , if the influence of the cu in the layers below is strong enough .",
    "along the n - axis , the center n atom becomes a natural source for a superexchange coupling between ti atoms , ruling out rkky which would need to take an indirect route under the n atom , a much longer route than directly across the n for superexchange .",
    "along the hollow - axis , however , there is no convenient single atom to hop across for superexchange , rather the sea of conduction electrons from the underlying and intervening cu .",
    "( unless one is to consider superexchange via the second - layer cu , an unlikely candidate . ) in this case rkky and direct overlap become more likely . indeed for an aligned spin configuration",
    ", we observe a direct overlap forming , as discussed above .",
    "however , the lowest energy state for coupling along the hollow - axis is antiferromagnetic , and we conclude that in this case it is likely due to rkky coupling .",
    "this could be tested experimentally by varying the ti - ti distance and measuring the exchange coupling ; however , only certain discrete lattice positions would be possible .    )",
    "plot for ferromagnetic ( top pannel : ( a ) and ( b ) ) and antiferromagnetic ( bottom pannel : ( c ) and ( d ) ) configuration of a ti dimer along the ( a ) n - axis and ( b ) hollow - axis .",
    "the most energetically favorable configurations are ferromagnetic across a n ( top left ) and antiferromagnetic across a void ( bottom right).,width=226 ]",
    "we find that a ti atom has spin-1 on the cun surface instead of spin-1/2 as found in the experiments @xcite . as a possible explanation ,",
    "we propose that there should be a two - stage kondo effect for this system . at high temperatures , ti starts with spin-1 , which then undergoes a transition to spin-1/2 with a first - stage kondo effect . at a lower temperature the second stage kondo effect",
    "brings it down from spin-1/2 to a spin - zero , and it is this spin-1/2 kondo effect that is seen in the low - temperature stm .",
    "this prediction can be tested by measuring the local density of states at higher temperatures than 0.5 k.    we find a ferromagnetic coupling along the n - axis and antiferromagnetic along the hollow - axis , for both the lattice and dimer of ti on the cun surface .",
    "ti lattice and dimer have a similar trend as well as strength of coupling .",
    "this indicates that interactions between ti atoms in the lattice configuration are local ; and a marked spin striped phase is found as the ground state of the lattice .",
    "we find a ferromagnetic coupling along the n - axis due to superexchange , with secondary contributions from direct exchange .",
    "we also postulate that the antiferromagnetic coupling along the hollow - axis is primarily due to rkky interactions , with a smaller direct exchange component ."
