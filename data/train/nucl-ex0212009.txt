    "the data described in this paper were taken during the year 2000 and year 2001 runs of the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the phobos apparatus  @xcite , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : detector ] , was used to take data at three energies : @xmath25 , 130 , and 200  gev .",
    "a partial test detector was also used to take data at @xmath26  gev  @xcite .",
    "the full phobos apparatus comprises several subdetectors .",
    "silicon detectors are employed for vertex finding , particle tracking and multiplicity measurements .",
    "this set of detectors has nearly full azimuthal coverage over a large pseudorapidity range @xmath27 .",
    "the detector setup also includes two sets of 16 scintillator counters ( `` paddle counters '' ) located at @xmath28  m relative to the nominal interaction point along the beam ( @xmath29 ) axis .",
    "these counters cover pseudorapidity in the range @xmath30 and served as the primary event trigger .",
    "the collision centrality is characterized by the average number of nucleon participants  @xmath31 , determined as described in refs .",
    "these references also tabulate the values and systematic errors of @xmath31 for each centrality bin .",
    "a key goal in the design of the phobos experiment was to perform a broad and systematic survey of hadronic particle production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "while this survey is still incomplete in terms of energies and species explored , significant progress has been made toward this goal .",
    "this section summarizes the basic measurements available so far : multiplicity , particle spectra and azimuthal asymmetry of particle production .",
    "the pseudorapidity densities ( @xmath32 ) and particle yields ( @xmath33 ) given here refer to primary produced particles and do not include feed - down products from weak decays of neutral strange particles .",
    "corrections were made for residual effects from secondary interactions and weak decay feed - down as well as for particles which were absorbed or produced in the material surrounding the collision ( primarily the beryllium beampipe and the magnet steel ) .",
    "the unique features of the phobos experiment relevant for the charged particle multiplicity measurements are the large acceptance of the detector and the 12  m long , 1  mm thick , beryllium beampipe which limits the absorption of low momentum particles and the production of secondaries .",
    "figure  [ fig : dndetas ] shows the charged particle pseudorapidity distributions ( @xmath32 ) measured at @xmath34  19.6 , 130 , and 200 gev for a variety of centrality bins for pseudorapidity in the range @xmath35  @xcite . due to the large coverage in @xmath36",
    ", @xmath32 is measured over almost the full range , except for a small missing fraction at very high @xmath37 . for central events ,",
    "this missing fraction is estimated to be less than 2% .",
    "the multiplicity results are discussed further in sections  [ sec : rule1 ] and  [ sec : rule2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : v2etaener ] shows the results of elliptic flow as a function of pseudorapidity from phobos for 130 and 200 gev .",
    "a unique feature of these results is the broad pseudorapidity reach covering almost 11 units of pseudorapidity and showing that there is no broad boost - invariant region near mid - rapidity .",
    "the error bars represent 1@xmath38 statistical errors and the boxes represent 90% confidence level systematic errors for the 200 gev data points .",
    "these results were measured using a hit - based analysis  @xcite . a new , track - based , analysis is also available both as a cross - check and to provide @xmath39 as a function of particle @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the unidentified charged particle yield measured by phobos for a range of centralities , with rapidity , @xmath40 , defined using the pion mass .",
    "these data cover rapidity in the range @xmath41 and transverse momenta in the range @xmath42  gev / c , corresponding to six decades of change in the magnitude of the yield .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowpt ] shows the invariant yields at very low @xmath7 measured by phobos  @xcite .",
    "these particles , which make it through the beampipe and then range out in the active silicon detectors in the field free region of the spectrometer , are mass - identified but not charge - identified .",
    "the yields are shown for ( @xmath43 ) , ( @xmath44 ) and ( @xmath45 ) measured at mid - rapidity @xmath46 in the transverse momentum ranges from 30 to 50 mev / c for charged pions , 90 to 130 mev / c for kaons and 140 to 210 mev / c for protons and antiprotons for the 15% most central au+au collisions at @xmath47 = 200 gev .",
    "the unique features of phobos relevant for the momentum - measured particles are the close proximity of the detector to the interaction region  ( 1080  cm ) , the precise vertex determination  ( 0.10.3  mm ) , good segmentation  ( 0.41  mm ) of the silicon detectors in the bend direction and , again , the small amount of material between the interaction and the first layers of silicon .",
    "these features allow the measurement of particles with good momentum resolution over a broad range of transverse momenta from 0.035.0  gev / c and beyond ( when statistics allow ) , as well as providing the ability to reject most secondaries and decay products",
    ".    the broad @xmath7 range , particularly the coverage to very low @xmath7 , will be important for constraining the role of dynamical processes such as rescattering and radial expansion in these collisions .",
    "the charged particle multiplicity ( and elliptic flow ) measurement spans roughly 11 units of pseudorapidity , @xmath48 in azimuth , and a factor of 10 in beam energy , in a single experiment , providing strong constraints on any description of the initial state and subsequent dynamics . from this broad dataset ,",
    "three empirical scaling rules have emerged .",
    "sections  [ sec : rule1][sec : rule3 ] describe each of them in turn .",
    "these rules , at the very least , provide a compact description of the data which must be respected by any model . at best , these empirical scaling rules may point the way to a more accurate description of the dynamics of these collisions .",
    "8 cm    the pseudorapidity distributions were shown in figure  [ fig : dndetas ] for three different collision energies ( @xmath49 ) . in order to separate the trivial kinematic broadening of the @xmath32 distribution from the more interesting dynamics",
    ", the data for @xmath0  collisions at different energies can be viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei .",
    "such an approach led to the ansatz of `` limiting fragmentation ''  @xcite , which successfully predicted the energy dependence of particle production away from mid - rapidity in hadron collisions , including pa  @xcite and @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "this ansatz states that , at high enough collision energy , both and the mix of particle species ( and therefore also @xmath1 ) reach a limiting value and become independent of energy in a region around @xmath51 , where and rapidity , with the @xmath52 axis defined as the beam ( collision ) axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : limfragc ] shows the scaled , shifted pseudorapidity distributions  @xcite .",
    "the results are folded about mid - rapidity ( positive and negative @xmath36 bins are averaged ) .",
    "the distributions are observed to be independent of collision energy over a substantial @xmath3 range .",
    "this is consistent with and extends a similar observation made by brahms  @xcite over a more restricted @xmath3 range .",
    "both the 19.6 and 130  gev data reach 8590% of their maximum value before deviating significantly ( more than 5% ) from the common limiting curve .",
    "the data presented here demonstrate that limiting fragmentation applies in the @xmath0  system , and that the `` fragmentation region '' in @xmath0  is rather broad , covering more than half of the available range of @xmath3 over which particles are produced .",
    "in particular , the fragmentation region grows significantly between 19.6  gev and 130 gev , extending more than two units away from the beam rapidity .",
    "particle production appears to approach a fixed limiting curve which extends far from the original beam rapidity , indicating that this limiting curve is an important feature of the overall interaction and not simply a nuclear breakup effect .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to the boost - invariance scenario  @xcite which predicts a fixed fragmentation region and a broad central rapidity plateau that grows in extent with increasing energy .",
    "in the upper part of figure  [ fig : aaee ] , total charged multiplicity data from @xmath54 , @xmath50 , @xmath5 , and aa ( scaled by @xmath55 ) are shown as a function of the appropriate @xmath56 for each system .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details and @xcite for the non - phobos data .",
    "the @xmath5  data serves as a reference sample , describing the behavior of a simple color dipole system with a large @xmath56 .",
    "the curve is a description of the @xmath5  data , given by the functional form : @xmath57 with the parameters a and b calculable in perturbative qcd and the constant parameter c determined by a fit to the @xmath5  data  @xcite . in order to compare them with @xmath5 ,",
    "the @xmath54  and @xmath50  data were plotted at an effective energy @xmath58 , which approximately accounts for the `` leading particle effect ''  @xcite .",
    "finally , central aa collisions , @xmath0  from the ags and rhic , and @xmath59  from cern are shown . over the available range of rhic energies from 19.6 to 200  gev ,",
    "the @xmath0  results are consistent with the @xmath5  results , suggesting a universality of particle production at high energy .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0  data approximately agrees with the scaled @xmath54and @xmath50  data suggesting that the effective energy of a high energy aa collision is approximately just @xmath49 .",
    "the lower part of figure  [ fig : aaee ] shows these same results , but divided by the @xmath5  fit .",
    "this figure illustrates the approach of aa from lower energies towards the high energy scaling result .",
    "figure  [ fig : aaeeshape ] compares the pseudorapidity distribution for central @xmath0  collisions to the closest available analog in @xmath5collisions : the thrust - axis - rapidity distribution , where the pion mass was used for all charged particles in @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this shows that particle production in @xmath0  and @xmath5  collisions approximately agree in longitudinal particle distribution as well as in the total yield .",
    "participant scaling was first established in the context of the total charged particle multiplicity produced in @xmath60collisions  @xcite . in high energy aa collisions ,",
    "small deviations from participant scaling for mid - rapidity @xmath61 have been seen .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig : aneta ] shows the mid - rapidity @xmath61 scaled by @xmath55 measured with the same apparatus for @xmath49 = 19.6 , 130 , and 200  gev .",
    "results of this type are sometimes interpreted in terms of a mixture of `` hard '' and `` soft '' components scaling as @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively  @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is somewhat ambiguous , however , since saturation models  @xcite describe the data more economically , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : aneta ] , and since both dynamic and kinematic effects can shift particles around in pseudorapidity as centrality changes .    due to the large acceptance of the phobos detector",
    ", we can integrate the total charged particle production in these collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ntotcent ] shows @xmath64 as a function of @xmath31 for the three different energies .",
    "also shown are the equivalent results for @xmath54  and @xmath50  as well as @xmath5  collisions at the same values of @xmath56 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath54/@xmath50  data are shown at their collision @xmath56 for this plot and not @xmath65 .",
    "three conclusions can be drawn from this result .",
    "first , total charged multiplicity in high energy aa collisions approximately scales with wounded nucleons ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "second , total particle production in aa collisions per participant pair is the same as the total particle production in @xmath5at the same energy for a broad range of centralities , not just for central collisions .",
    "finally , particle production in @xmath54  and @xmath50collisions is reduced compared to aa and @xmath5 .",
    "while the overall charged particle production scales with @xmath63 , at high @xmath7 , particle production is expected to scale with @xmath66 .",
    "deviations from this scaling at high @xmath7 are likely to indicate high density effects in the initial or final state .",
    "phenix and star have already shown that high @xmath7 hadron production is suppressed with respect to @xmath67  @xcite . recalling that figure  [ fig : ntotcent ] indicates that @xmath54  collisions may not be the ideal reference sample , we investigate the scaling of high @xmath7 hadron production in aa collisions internally , using a mid - central @xmath0collision as a reference rather than @xmath54  data .",
    "figure  [ fig : christof ] shows @xmath68 as a function of @xmath31 scaled by the value of the most peripheral point for @xmath69 for various values of @xmath7 .",
    "the centrality bins used here are specified in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the solid curve in the lower right - hand panel is @xmath70 .",
    "this curve shows the expectation if @xmath71 scaling for    8 cm    @xmath0  collisions held true over the centrality range shown .",
    "this ratio varies by a factor of two over this centrality range , and yet the particle production approximately scales with @xmath63 for most @xmath7 bins .",
    "this confirms the empirical observation that particle production at high @xmath7 is suppressed with respect to the `` hard scaling '' expectation .",
    "however , we note the additional intriguing fact that , for @xmath72 , we see approximate @xmath63 scaling of both low and high @xmath7 particle production .",
    "mid - range particles with @xmath73  gev / c show a small violation of @xmath63 scaling , but are still suppressed with respect to the nave scaling expectations .",
    "this particular form of `` high @xmath7 suppression '' could be an indication of initial state suppression ( e.g. parton saturation ) or that the final state suppression ( e.g. `` jet quenching '' ) reaches a geometric maximum involving one power of length scale @xmath74 .",
    "of course , this apparent @xmath63 scaling could also be accidental .",
    "the phobos experiment has measured a systematic dataset of au+au collisions at the rhic collider .",
    "these data span an energy range from @xmath49 = 19.6 to 200 gev , a pseudorapidity range from -5.4 to + 5.4 and a centrality range from 65 to 340 participating nucleons .",
    "it also includes particle spectra covering the @xmath7 range from 0.03 to 5.0  gev / c .",
    "three empirical observations have emerged from this dataset .",
    "first , there is clear evidence of limiting fragmentation in @xmath0collisions : an energy - independent region of @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this energy - independent region grows with energy , allowing only a limited region ( if any ) of longitudinal boost - invariance .",
    "second , there is a striking , unexplained , similarity of particle production in @xmath5  and particle production per participating nucleon pair in @xmath0  collisions .",
    "finally , particle production has been found to approximately scale with number of participating nucleon pairs for @xmath6 .",
    "this scaling occurs for the total multiplicity and also for high @xmath7 particles ( including 3  @xmath8  4.5  gev / c ) .",
    "these empirical observations serve , at least , to characterize heavy ion collisions in an economical way and to challenge models . at best ,",
    "the observed scaling and universalities may point the way to a fairly simple partonic description of this high density matter and thus advance our knowledge of the strong interaction .",
