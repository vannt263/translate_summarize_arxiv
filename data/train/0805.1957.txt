    "the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity ( sc ) in the vicinity of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) is one of the most intriguing subjects in the heavy - fermion systems .",
    "the qcp is characterized by the phase transition at zero temperature , which is generated by suppressing a magnetically ordered state via changing pressure , magnetic field and chemical composition .",
    "the sc often emerges near the qcp , and it is therefore believed that the magnetic fluctuation enhanced near the qcp plays a crucial role in the formation of the cooper pairs .",
    "the recently discovered heavy - fermion compounds cemin@xmath2 ( @xmath13 and co ; hocoga@xmath2-type tetragonal structure ) provide a unique opportunity to investigate this subject .",
    "cecoin@xmath2 is an unconventional superconductor characterized by an anomalously large specific - heat jump ( @xmath14 ) at transition temperature @xmath15.@xcite a strong pauli - limiting effect gives rise to a first - order transition at sc critical field @xmath16 below 0.7 k.@xcite in addition , above @xmath16 the non - fermi - liquid behavior is observed in the temperature variations of the specific heat and the resistivity , which is considered to be due to the effect of quantum - critical fluctuation induced in the proximity of antiferromagnetism.@xcite on the other hand , cerhin@xmath2 shows an incommensurate ( ic ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) order below @xmath17 at ambient pressure , whose structure has been proposed to be a helical ( spiral ) with a propagation vector of @xmath18.@xcite as pressure @xmath19 is applied , @xmath20 initially increases to 4 k ( @xmath21 ) , and then rapidly decreases with further increasing @xmath19 . at the same time , the sc develops above @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 increases with increasing @xmath19 and merges with @xmath20 at the critical pressure @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting to investigate the relationship between the ic - af and sc phases for cerhin@xmath2 and cecoin@xmath2 . the specific - heat , magnetization , and resistivity measurements @xcite for mixed compounds cerh@xmath0co@xmath1in@xmath2 revealed that the ic - af phase for pure cerhin@xmath2 is weakly suppressed upon doping with co , and then vanishes at the qcp : @xmath25 .",
    "the sc phase appears above @xmath26 , suggesting the coexistence of both phases for intermediate co concentrations .",
    "the obtained @xmath27 phase diagram is quite similar to the @xmath28 phase diagram for pure cerhin@xmath2 .",
    "recently , we found from the neutron scattering experiments that a commensurate ( c ) af order with a modulation of @xmath5 evolves in the ic - af phase at @xmath29.@xcite this suggests that the c - af correlation is tightly coupled with the sc .",
    "we expect that further insight on the role of the c- and ic - af correlations to the sc is obtainable from both the bulk and microscopic investigations on a wide @xmath11 range .",
    "in addition , it is remarkable that the recently proposed @xmath27 phase diagram @xcite differs from previous one,@xcite while it involves the c - af phase in intermediate @xmath11 range .",
    "we have thus performed the specific heat and neutron scattering experiments on cerh@xmath0co@xmath1in@xmath2 with entire @xmath11 range to clarify the characteristics of af states near the qcp and find similarity or difference between them and the previously reported ones .",
    "single crystals of cerh@xmath0co@xmath1in@xmath2 were grown from an in flux with appropriate amounts of ce , rh and co as starting materials .",
    "we prepared rod - type samples along the tetragonal @xmath30 $ ] direction ( typical size of @xmath31 ) for neutron scattering measurements by cutting out from the large ingots of the single crystal , and small pieces of single crystal for specific heat measurements .",
    "the electron probe microanalysis ( epma ) measurements for the sample used in the specific heat and neutron scattering experiments indicate that the estimated rh / co concentrations @xmath11 significantly deviate from the nominal ( starting ) values , which occurs frequently in the sample grown by the flux technique .",
    "similar deviation of @xmath11 is also observed in the samples investigated previously:@xcite @xmath11 for the samples used in bulk and neutron scattering measurements were estimated to be 0.45 and 0.53 , respectively , while the nominal @xmath11 was 0.4 .",
    "in fact , a crucial problem on the reproducibility caused by the large distribution of @xmath11 was found in several samples .",
    "we will thus use the samples with homogeneous distribution of @xmath11 being achieved within a few percent error , and adopt the @xmath11 value estimated from the epma measurements for each sample throughout this article .",
    "specific heat @xmath32 was measured using a thermal relaxation method in a commercial @xmath33he refrigerator ( oxford instruments ) from 0.5 k to 100 k. elastic neutron scattering experiments for @xmath34 and 0.70(3 ) were performed on the triple - axis spectrometers gptas ( 4 g ) and ponta ( 5 g ) located at the jrr-3 m research reactor of the jaea , tokai .",
    "the neutron momentum @xmath35 was chosen with the ( 002 ) reflection of the pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) for both monochromator and analyzer , and a set of 40-40-40-80 collimators together with two pg filters was used .",
    "the samples were mounted in standard al capsules filled with @xmath36he gas so that the scattering plane becomes @xmath37 , and cooled down to 1.5 k in a pumped @xmath36he cryostat . in this geometry",
    "the sample rod is perpendicular to the scattering plane , enabling to minimize an effect of high neutron absorption by rh and in .",
    "the neutron penetration length in the samples for the present @xmath38 value was calculated to be @xmath39 .",
    "figure 1 shows temperature variations of the specific heat divided by temperature @xmath40 . a jump associated with the ic - af order",
    "is clearly seen at @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the magnitude of the jump is reduced with increasing @xmath11 , and then the jump becomes obscure around @xmath43 at @xmath7 .",
    "a kink anomaly appears at @xmath44 in @xmath32 for @xmath45 ( see the inset of fig .  1 ) , which originates from the c - af order.@xcite the evolution of the sc yields another jump in @xmath40 at @xmath46 for @xmath47 , whose magnitude increases with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "it seems that the entropy release estimated from @xmath40 below @xmath23 is not simply balanced .",

    "the @xmath48 and @xmath23 values as well as the shape of the @xmath27 phase diagram of ours are reasonably comparable to those in the first report.@xcite on the other hand , although an ambiguity on the determination of the transition temperatures still remains , there is a qualitative difference between our @xmath27 phase diagram and recently proposed one:@xcite former involves both the ic- and c - af phases in the intermediate @xmath11 range while latter does only the c - af phase .",
    "the strong sample quality dependence may be responsible for such differences . nevertheless , it is interesting that our @xmath27 phase diagram for cerh@xmath0co@xmath1in@xmath2 , including the existence of the c - af order and the sc , is quite similar to that for the isostructural ir - doped system cerh@xmath0ir@xmath1in@xmath2.@xcite     phase diagram estimated from the @xmath40 data for cerh@xmath0co@xmath50in@xmath2 . @xmath48 and",
