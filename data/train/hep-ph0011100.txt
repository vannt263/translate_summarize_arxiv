    "the understanding of the bfkl pomeron has been demanding a considerable theoretical effort . its behavior in perturbative qcd",
    "is determined by generating the integral equation @xcite .",
    "that procedure consists of summing the leading logarithms on energy , @xmath4 , order by order from perturbation theory and the main result is that the @xmath5 for the @xmath6-exchange process is a power of @xmath7 .    a priori",
    ", bfkl is itself asymptotic and we may ask if at finite energies , i.e. non asymptotic regime , summing a finite number of terms from the bfkl series could describe the existent data . for",
    "that we should use a truncated bfkl series , performing a finite sum of gluon ladders ( bearing in mind reggeized gluons and considering effective vertices ) .",
    "the question that remains is how many orders should one take into account .",
    "the lowest order two gluons exchange calculation leads to a @xmath5 constant on @xmath7 and the next contribution to the sum is the one rung gluon ladder , which provides a logarithmic growth . in order to avoid unitarity violation and",
    "by simplicity we truncate our summation at this order . as a result a successfull fit to the @xmath0 with these two contributions is obtained and presented in sec .",
    "2 . these results motivate to check the non - forward amplitude in order to obtain the prediction for the @xmath2 , which gives the behavior on the momentum transfer @xmath3 .    in the bfkl framework",
    "such analysis is dependent of the proton impact factor ( if ) input , which introduces certain uncertainty due to the presence of non - perturbative content .",
    "the ifs determine the coupling of the pomeron to the color singlet hadrons and play a crucial role in the calculation of the non - forward amplitude .",
    "we calculate the @xmath8 elastic amplitude at @xmath1 taking into account two distict anstze to the proton if : the dirac form factor , as proposed recently by balitsky and kuchina @xcite and the usual non - perturbative ansatz @xcite .",
    "the main resulting features are discussed in sec . 3 , although considering that a more realistic ansatz to the proton if is still to be found .",
    "in addition the @xmath2 is calculated in the small @xmath3 approximation and compared with the experimental data . in the last section we present our conclusions .",
    "in the leading logarithm approximation ( lla ) , the pomeron is obtained considering the color singlet ladder diagrams whose vertical lines are reggeized gluons coupled to the rungs through the effective vertices .",
    "the correspondent amplitude is purely imaginary and the coupling constant @xmath9 is considered frozen in some transverse momentum scale @xcite . for the elastic scattering of a hadron , the mellin transform of the scattering amplitude is given by @xcite :    @xmath10    where the @xmath11 is the color factor for the color singlet exchange , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons in the @xmath3-channel and @xmath14 is the momentum transfer , with @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath16 is the mellin transform of the bfkl kernel @xmath17 , which states the dynamics of the process and is obtained in perturbative qcd .",
    "the main properties of the lo kernel are well known @xcite and the results arising from the nlo calculations have yielded intense debate in the literature recently @xcite .    in the case of @xmath18(@xmath19 ) scattering , the factor @xmath20 is the proton if , which in the absence of a perturbative scale has a non - perturbative feature and furnishes the @xmath6-proton coupling .",
    "this factor turns the amplitude infrared safe when the colliding particles are colorless . in the leading order of perturbation theory we have @xmath21 and in the next order @xmath22   \\ , .",

    "this is not an easy task , namely these hadronic processes are soft and there is no hard scale allowing to use perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , we should know in details the parton wavefunction in the hadron to calculate the ifs properly . since this is not available ,",
    "several models are proposed in order to calculate them .    from the optical theorem ,",
    "the lowest order contribution to the @xmath5 is a constant term , and the next order term is a logarithm of the energy , scaled by a typical gluon transverse momentum of the process ( arbitrary ) .",
    "when considering @xmath25 there is no need to deal with both a specific form for the if and the transverse momentum integration .",
    "this allows to consider @xmath7-independent factors in each term as free parameters and to obtain them from data .",
    "the correct description at low energy requires the reggeon contribution , which is parameterized from regge theory .",
    "our expression to the total cross section is then ,    @xmath26    hence we fix the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 from data on @xmath19 , imposing the same contribution for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure is reasonable due to the higher energies reached on @xmath19 collision , where the pomeron dominates . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath18 data are predominantly at low energy , which is not strongly sensitive to the pomeron model , thus dominated by the reggeonic contribution .",
    "a successful description of data is obtained for the whole range of energy .",
    "the result is shown in the fig .",
    "the parameters and a more detailed discussion can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hypothesis of considering two orders from the bfkl series ( @xmath29 ) is phenomenologically corroborated by the well known dispersion relation fit @xcite .",
    "an important additional advantage is that the total cross section obtained is consistent with the unitarity constraint , avoiding unitarization procedures . as a final remark , at the lhc energy ( @xmath30 tev ) the extrapolation of our results",
    "will give @xmath31 .",
    "in order to calculate the elastic amplitude at @xmath1 , information about the coupling between the proton and the @xmath3-channel reggeized gluons in the ladder is required .",
    "namely , introducing a reliable proton if that has to be modeled since it can not be calculated from first principles due to the unknowledge on the wavefunction of the hadronic constituent partons . here",
    "are analized two distinct models for the if :      balitsky and kuchina proposed recently @xcite that at large momentum transfer the coupling of the bfkl pomeron to the nucleon is essentially equal to the dirac form factor of the nucleon .",
    "their basic idea is that in the lowest order in perturbation theory there is no difference between the diagrams for the nucleon if and similar diagrams with two gluons replaced by two photons , in such a way that the amplitudes can be calculated without any model assumption .",
    "this if , @xmath32 , is decoupled in the transverse momentum integration and presents an explicit dependence on @xmath3 , being similar to the usual pomeron - proton coupling used in regge phenomenology .",
    "the expression is    @xmath33    the choice for this proton if is useful when one analyzes near forward observables , for instance the elastic differential cross section .",
    "however it does not play the role of a regulator of infrared divergences at @xmath8 process because clearly it does not vanish when the gluon transverse momenta goes to zero . in electron - proton process",
    "the situation is different since the photon impact factor supplies that condition @xcite .",
    "then the next step is to perform the gluon transverse momenta integrations .",
    "in fact , such integrals are infrared divergent and should be regularized .",
    "an usual way out is to introduce an infrared cut - off @xmath34 , temporally defining a small gluon mass , avoiding problems at the infrared region .",
    "this procedure is quite similar as to take into account a non - perturbative massive gluon propagator ( see i.e. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the lowest order ( order @xmath35 )",
    "contribution , using eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) , gives the following result : @xmath36 ^ 2 \\frac{\\pi}{(|t|-\\lambda^2)}\\,\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{|t|}\\right ) \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the one rung gluon ladder has two components ( order @xmath37 ) , given by the following expression : @xmath38 ^ 2 \\,s\\ , \\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{{\\bf k^2}}\\right)\\,(i_1 + i_2)\\ , , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 corresponding to the one rung gluon ladder and @xmath40 correspondent to the three gluons exchange graphs , whose order is also @xmath41 .",
    "such structure is due to the fact that in the color singlet calculation there is no cancellation between graphs and one can not obtain an expression for the two - loop level which is proportional to the one loop amplitude @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath40 through symmetry on the integration variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see eqs .",
    "( 1,3 ) ) and the factor @xmath42 collects the correspondent color factors and the remaining constants .",
    "the explicit calculation of those integrals , yields    @xmath43    @xmath44    some comments about the amplitude above are in order .",
    "the scale of the factor @xmath34 should be at non - perturbative regime , i.e. @xmath45 gev@xmath46 . an interesting aspect is the behavior of the amplitude at the forward limit @xmath25 , where it becames very large .",
    "this limit is a well known property of perturbative qcd calculations and there are several reasons to believe that the point @xmath25 plays a very special role , such that perturbation theory may even not be applicable . for the full bfkl series in the forward region there is still the diffusion on tranverse momenta , i.e. on @xmath47 , which extends into both the ultraviolet and the infrared regions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the momentum scale @xmath3 supplies the control condition .",
    "however , we will suppose that a smooth transition from a finite @xmath3 down to @xmath25 is possible and that the finite bfkl series gives the correct behavior on energy for the forward observables .",
    "later we make use of this hypothesis to obtain the logarithmic slope @xmath48 and the differential elastic cross section .      using quite general properties of the ifs ,",
    "namely they vanish as transverse momenta go to zero , one can guess their behavior which is determined by the large scale nucleon dynamics .",
    "regardless its exact shape , in general the proton if takes the form @xcite :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a scale which is typical of the non - perturbative dynamics . as a consequence of this choice",
    "the momentum transfer behavior is completely determined by the kernel .",
    "the amplitude now reads : @xmath51    \\nonumber \\\\ + \\ , a^{\\prime}\\,\\ln\\left(\\frac{s}{{\\bf k}^2}\\right)\\,\\left [   \\frac{\\ln ( \\mu^2)}{(|t|- \\mu^2 ) } + \\frac{\\ln(\\mu^2)|t|}{(|t|-\\mu^2)^2}\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{|t|}\\right)\\right ] \\,.\\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we use the definition @xmath52 .",
    "we observe again a divergent behavior at @xmath25 , nevertheless we claim that the forward amplitude is finite in this point and the dependence on energy is correctly described . despite obtaining an analytic expression to the elastic scattering amplitude ,",
    "a direct comparison with the experimental data is known not to be reliable .",
    "in fact , data on differential cross section at low @xmath3 are parameterized in the form @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the forward slope @xcite . therefore",
    ", we can obtain an expression for the differential cross section at small @xmath3 , using our previous results .",
    "the usual relation to describe the cross section is : @xmath55_{t=0}\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the regge framework the slope is obtained from the powerlike behavior of the scattering amplitude , dependent of the effective slope of the pomeron trajectory @xmath56 , namely @xmath57 .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 comes from the slope of the @xmath59-@xmath59-@xmath6 vertex . in our case",
    "we should obtain the slope from the non forward elastic scattering amplitudes @xmath60 obtained above . for the amplitude obtained employing the balitsky and kuchina impact factor it results the following slope @xmath61 where the first term does not contribute effectively at @xmath25 and we are left only with the second term . from simple inspection of the amplitude obtained with the usual impact factor ( see eq . ( 5 ) )",
    "we also verify that one gets a similar expression to the correspondent slope .    considering the specific form for the @xmath3-derivative of the amplitudes , their asymptotic values at @xmath25 depend only on the energy .",
    "in fact , they take the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are @xmath7-independent parameters . for our case , the amplitude is purely imaginary , then @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "putting all together , the corresponding slope is @xmath67\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the elastic differential cross section is given by eq .",

    "the elastic differential cross section is straighforwardly determined and a successful comparison with its experimental measurements at @xmath71 gev is shown in the fig .",
    "( 2 ) .    in summary",
    ", we study the contribution of a truncated bfkl series to the hadronic process , specifically the @xmath8 collisions , considering two orders in perturbation theory corresponding to the bare two gluons exchange and the one rung gluon ladder . despite the restrictions imposed by the use of a perturbative approach for soft observables , a good description of the total cross sections",
    "was obtained motivating an analysis of the elastic differential cross section .",
    "although the qcd perturbation theory is in principle not reliable at the forward direction ( @xmath25 ) , nevertheless we suppose that perturbation theory gives the behavior on energy even in this region . the next step is to consider @xmath3 different from zero , where the momentum transfer furnishes a scale to perform suitable calculations . in order to proceed this",
    ", we calculate the non forward amplitude introducing two distinct anstze for the proton impact factor , namely a factorizable @xmath3-dependent proposed recently by balitsky and kuchina and the usual non - perturbative impact factor . in order to describe data we used a small momentum transfer approximation and obtained an expression to the elastic slope @xmath72 and the correspondent parameters .",
    "the elastic differential cross section is obtained straightforwardly , describing with good agreement the experimental data at both low and high energy values .",
