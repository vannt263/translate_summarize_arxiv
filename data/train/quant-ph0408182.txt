    "closed - form wave packet solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation are excellent exemplary models to study the time - evolution of quantum systems for comparison to their classical counterparts . because of their special properties , gaussian solutions are possible for a few of the most familiar classical systems .",
    "free - particle gaussian wave packet solutions are standard fare in introductory textbooks in quantum mechanics , and this example goes back at least to darwin @xcite .",
    "the problem of a particle acting under a uniform force has similar gaussian solutions which were first derived by kennard @xcite and occasionally appear in undergraduate - level presentations @xcite .",
    "wave packet solutions for the harmonic oscillator are discussed in some textbooks @xcite ( most often using propagator techniques ) and , with a simple change of variables , can also be used to describe particles in unstable equilibrium @xcite , giving rise to solutions which exhibit the expected exponential runaway behavior .",
    "gaussian solutions corresponding to classical helical motion in a uniform magnetic field @xcite have also been constructed . in all of these cases ,",
    "the special form of the gaussian solutions allows for the explicit evaluation of time - dependent expectation values for position ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , momentum ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , and other quantities , for easy comparison to classical expectations .",
    "another simple system , also with a clear classical analog , is given by an otherwise free particle , but restricted to the half - line by an infinite wall at @xmath2 , namely the problem defined by the 1d potential @xmath14 in the classical case , a point particle would move freely , with constant kinetic ( and hence total ) energy , exhibiting an impulsive collision at the wall , resulting in a discontinuous change in momentum .",
    "localized time - dependent solutions for this problem , dubbed _ bouncing wave packets _ , can be constructed in a very straightforward way from solutions of the free - particle problem .",
    "andrews @xcite has noted that simple difference solutions of the form @xmath3 not only satisfy the free - particle schrdinger equation for all @xmath15 values ( if @xmath16 does ) , but also accommodate the new boundary condition at the wall , namely that @xmath17 .",
    "this construction is very similar to image methods in electrostatics and has been used in numerical evaluations and visualizations of such systems @xcite , as well as for discussions of wave packet propagation in the infinite square well @xcite , @xcite ( with two infinite walls producing an infinite series of image wave functions . )",
    "such solutions have also been used to visualize many aspects of the collision with the wall @xcite and we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : bounce ] an example of the time - dependent @xmath18 using just such a construction , illustrating the obvious interference effects between the @xmath16 and @xmath19 terms , near the time of the ` bounce ' with the wall .",
    "the study of general relationships between expectation values , such as @xmath20 is straightforward for many of the familiarly treated quantum mechanical systems @xcite , especially for well - behaved potential energy functions . on the other hand , for infinite well type potentials of the type considered here , the relationship to the classical force can be more subtle and so having exact or approximate closed - form solutions for quantities such as @xmath8 and @xmath6 to probe such relationships is very useful .",
    "for example , the force exerted on the walls in an infinite square well potential has been recently examined in a somewhat similar context , using more numerical methods , focusing on the time - dependent relationships in eqn .",

    ", we will show that if one uses standard gaussian solutions in this mirror or difference solution approach for the potential in eqn .",
    "( [ infinite_wall_potential ] ) , one can also perform many ( but not all ) of the standard calculations including exact normalization of the wave packet solution , evaluation of many expectation values , and the calculation of the autocorrelation function , @xmath21 , to obtain exact closed - form results , which is the main thrust of sec .",
    "[ sec : solutions ] .",
    "this case then adds another example to the otherwise rather small pantheon of closed - form quantum mechanical gaussian solutions to one - dimensional problems with classical analogs . using these solutions",
    ", we will also be able to discuss the nature of the collision with the wall , deriving approximate expressions for the impulsive force exerted on the particle during the collision .",
    "we will also be able to explicitly evaluate the change in kinetic ( and hence total ) energy induced by the addition of the infinite barrier , making connections to earlier work on the _ effects of distant boundaries _",

    "the resulting integrals can be done in terms of error functions ( erf@xmath49 ) , but simple expressions for special cases of interest are perhaps more useful .",
    "for example , the classical prediction for the position is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ; the time of the classical collision with the wall , @xmath52 , is determined by the condition @xmath53 and we can expand the integrals required for an evaluation of @xmath54 in terms of @xmath55 , treated as a small parameter , to obtain the approximation @xmath56 ^ 2}{\\beta_t \\sqrt{\\pi } } + \\cdots\\right)_{t \\approx t_c } \\ , .",

    "this implies that the expectation value of momentum at the classical collision time does not vanish , for reasons which are most easily visualized using the behavior of the time - dependent momentum - space probability densities , as in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for times long before and long after the ` bounce ' , the momentum distribution is peaked at @xmath60 ( within @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 ( within @xmath61 ) respectively .",
    "roughly speaking , at the classical collision time , the momentum components corresponding to the fastest speeds ( in the @xmath63 half of the distribution ) have already been reflected from the wall and are already flipped in sign to have values @xmath64 , while the slower components are still predominantly in the lower @xmath65 half of the distribution , but still positive .",
    "there is a small resulting asymmetry in the momentum - distribution , giving an expectation value of order @xmath66 , as in eqn .",
    "( [ collision_time_momentum ] ) .",
    "the result in eqn .",
    "( [ approx ] ) is also useful in that it gives similarly valid approximations for higher derivatives , such as @xmath67 which can then be used to describe the effective force exerted on the particle by the wall near the classical collision time .",

    "( [ expectation_values ] ) using the potential energy function in eqn .",
    "( [ infinite_wall_potential ] ) . the dimensional dependence of this result on @xmath68 can be easily understood from simply assuming that the change in momentum during the collision is of order @xmath69 , while the collision time , @xmath70 , is determined by @xmath71 assuming we identify @xmath72 near the time of the collision    finally , another useful quantity which can be evaluated in closed form for the solution in eqn .",

    "for example , a modified free - particle momentum - space solution of the form @xmath81 gives the expectation values @xmath82 and can be fourier transformed to yield the position - space wavefunction @xmath83 with @xmath84 the uncertainty principle product in this case is given by @xmath85 which is similar to that for the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator , at least for @xmath38 .",
