    "a _ cube tiling _ is a family @xmath4^n)$ ] of translates of the unit cube @xmath5^n$ ] that tiles @xmath6 by translation .",
    "a cube tiling is said to be of _ class _ @xmath7 if it is @xmath8 periodic and if the vectors @xmath9 belong to @xmath10 .",
    "up to scaling this corresponds to @xmath11 periodic tilings of @xmath6 by integral translates of the cube @xmath0^n$ ] .",
    "the origin of the subject of cube packing is with what is called keller s conjecture ( @xcite ) that generalize a previous conjecture of minkowski .",
    "the conjecture states that in every packing of @xmath6 by translates of the cube @xmath5^n$ ] there exist two cubes that share a facet .",
    "the conjecture was proved to be true for @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "it was proved to be false for @xmath13 in @xcite and for @xmath14 in @xcite .",
    "the counterexample found were of class @xmath15 .",
    "previously , it was found in @xcite that keller s conjecture is true for all @xmath16 if and only if it is true for all cube packings of class @xmath15 and all dimensions .",
    "if one restricts to the case of cube tilings of class @xmath15 of dimension @xmath16 then the keller s conjecture is a finite problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is equivalent to proving that some graph @xmath17 having @xmath18 vertices has a clique number lower than @xmath19 . in @xcite",
    "it was proven that the clique number of this graph @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "this shows that keller s conjecture is true in dimension @xmath22 for the class of @xmath15 cube tilings .",
    "but it does not a priori rule out the possibility of a counter - example in dimension @xmath22 that is not of class @xmath15 , though this is unlikely .",
    "the computation in @xcite was an extraordinary accomplishment that was for long though to require a computer , the `` size of a galaxy '' .",
    "it therefore appears that the class @xmath15 of cube tilings is very interesting to study .",
    "also a priori interesting is to consider cube packings . for such classes @xmath23 , questions of iterative packing and extensibility",
    "also , since the class @xmath15 is finite in a given dimension , questions of classifications occurs that may be of interest .",
    "we will report on the recent works in the subject .",
    "the classes @xmath7 for @xmath24 are much harder to study combinatorially and of limited interest . however , as @xmath25 goes to @xmath26 , one can study a special kind of continuous cube tiling obtained with positive probability .",
    "this was introduced in @xcite but there has been less progress on this problem since it is less directly combinatorial .",
    "we will therefore instead report on the problems that we consider the most important .",
    "a _ cube packing _ is a family @xmath4^n)_{i\\in i}$ ] of translates of the unit cube @xmath5^n$ ] that tiles @xmath6 by translation .",
    "a cube packing is said to be of _ class _ @xmath23 if it is @xmath8 periodic and if the vectors @xmath9 belong to @xmath10 .    one method for obtaining cube tilings of class @xmath15 is to take vectors @xmath27 at random in @xmath28 and add the cubes if they do not overlap with preexisting ones .",
    "this method can be considered as a random process and this approach has a long history starting from @xcite .",
    "it was extended to packing in the cube @xmath29^n$ ] by integral translates of the cube @xmath30^n$ ] in @xcite where estimates on the expectation of the obtained random cube packing are obtained @xcite .    in dimension",
    "@xmath31 the sequential random cube packing into torus will always give a tiling .",
    "however , in dimension @xmath32 we can obtain with non - zero probability a non - extensible cube packing with @xmath33 translation classes and thus density @xmath34 ( see figure [ uniqueinex ] ) .",
    "the full classification of @xmath15 cube tilings has been obtained in dimension @xmath35 .",
    "see table [ tableclassification ] for the number of types .",
    "since for @xmath35 , keller s conjecture is true any cube tiling has two cubes that share a face .",
    "this means that we can shift them by @xmath36 with @xmath37 a basis vector .",
    "by iterating such operations one can get new cube tilings .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath35 all cube tilings can be obtained by starting from the trivial cube tiling by integral translates of @xmath5^n$ ] ( see @xcite for the case @xmath38 and @xcite for @xmath39 ) . it would be interesting to know if this also holds in dimension @xmath40 and @xmath22 .",
    "the packings of low density are harder to study .",
    "let us denote by @xmath41 the minimum number of translation in a non - extensible cube packing of class @xmath42 .",
    "similarly let us denote by @xmath43 the minimum number of translation classes of cubes , possibly overlapping that are needed in order to prevent the addition of one non - overlapping cube ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "obviously @xmath44 .",
    "table [ knownvalues_f_h ] from @xcite gives the known values of @xmath41 and @xmath43 .",
    "other exhaustive enumeration works seems impossible in that direction now . however , one direction that has not been really considered is obtaining infinite families of low density packings for all @xmath16 .    a _ hole _",
    "@xmath45 is the complement of a non - extensible cube packing @xmath46 with @xmath47 cubes .",
    "such non - extensible cube - packings do not exist for @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath32 and any dimension @xmath16 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) . in (",
    "* conjecture 1 ) we stated that for @xmath50 the holes @xmath45 is essentially unique and is given by the one of figure [ uniqueinex ] and its higher dimensional extensions .",
    "we also conjectured that holes do not exist for @xmath51 .",
    "the conjecture was proved in @xcite for @xmath38 by an exhaustive enumeration .",
    "also we conjectured that for @xmath52 or @xmath53 in any dimension , the holes belong to a finite set of possibilities .",
    "it seems to us that such conjectures are not hopeless and could be proved by extending the proof technique of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) .",
    ".number of types of cube tilings in dimension @xmath35 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the main peculiarity of cube tilings of class @xmath7 is the @xmath8 periodicity .",
    "it imposes that for any two translation classes of cubes @xmath54^n$ ] and @xmath55^n$ ] that are non - overlapping , there exist a coordinate @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 differ by an integer .",
    "we choose to consider this as their main feature and see the behavior of the cube tilings as @xmath59 .",
    "the formalism is explained in details in @xcite and allows to consider the cube packing that are obtained with positive probability as the main objects .    from the viewpoint of exhaustive combinatorial enumeration the problems are easier with a slower combinatorial explosion ( for example in dimension",
    "@xmath33 we have @xmath60 types of such continuous cube tilings vs @xmath61 for the class @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , the absence of a graph formalism makes it harder to program and they were thus much less studied .    on the other hand the continuous structure gives the notion of number of parameters that are needed to describe the structure .",
    "it is conjectured ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 5.4 ) ) that this number of parameters is at most @xmath62 but we were unable to prove it .",
    "the number of parameters is at least @xmath63 but an open question is to prove the existence of a cube tiling with this number of parameters and obtained with positive probability .    in one respect",
    "the continuous case is simpler . for @xmath16 odd",
    "the minimal non - extensible cube packings can be classified ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.5 ) ) : they have @xmath64 translation classes of cubes and are described by what are called one - factorizations of perfect graphs @xmath65 with @xmath66 . such one - factorizations exist for any @xmath67 ( @xcite ) and the number of non - isomorphic types is known for @xmath68 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath16 is even , then one expects the existence of a non - extensible continuous cube packing with @xmath69 cubes and @xmath63 parameters , but the expected cube packings would be more complicated than one - factorization .",
