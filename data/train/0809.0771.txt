    "systems of ultracold bosonic gases in optical lattices have recently become a popular research topic @xcite . after their theoretical suggestion @xcite and first experimental realization @xcite it soon became clear that they represent model systems for solid - state physics with a yet unprecedented level of control .",
    "both the periodic one - particle potential , which is superimposed with an additional harmonic trap for the purpose of confinement , and the two - particle interaction strength can be experimentally tuned with high precision @xcite . with this",
    "it is now possible to achieve strong correlations in these systems even though their particle densities are more than five orders of magnitude less than for air . in addition , due to the absence of impurities , they are viewed as idealized condensed matter systems which allow for a clear theoretical analysis @xcite .",
    "+ current research in optical lattices is driven by a number of cornerstone experiments which investigate , among other things , lower dimensionality @xcite , the formation of a distinct shell structure in the particle density @xcite , and a more quantitative analysis of the time - of - flight interference patterns via their visibility @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dynamical aspects are now under crucial investigation @xcite as , for instance , the collapse and revival of the interference patters in nonequilibrium situations @xcite . furthermore , using either bosonic or fermionic atoms in optical lattices reveals a contrasting bunching or antibunching behavior which can be fully attributed to the different quantum statistics of each atomic species @xcite",
    ". mixtures of bosons and fermions are also currently studied @xcite , and this has even led to the creation of heteronuclear molecules @xcite .",
    "thus , in the near future it will be possible to test the theoretical prediction of new phases in optical lattices arising from an additional dipole - dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "another emerging line of research is the investigation of the effect of controlled disorder which can be created by several methods @xcite .",
    "it turns out that an additional frozen random potential leads to a bose - glass phase due to the localization of bosons in the randomly distributed minima @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been proposed to use ultracold bosons in optical lattices to realize a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "+ an optical lattice is created by pairs of counter - propagating laser beams in all three dimensions . loading bosons with mass @xmath0 in this laser field",
    ", the stark effect leads to an effective periodic one - particle potential @xmath1 with lattice spacing @xmath2 and laser wave length @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the energy scale of the system is set by the recoil energy @xmath4 , which is used to introduce dimensionless energies @xmath5 . neglecting the overall harmonic trapping potential , which is superimposed in order to spatially",
    "confine the system , spin - polarized bosons in an optical lattice can be described within the grand - canonical ensemble by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the standard creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 denotes the chemical potential , and the sum over @xmath11 includes only pairs of nearest neighbors .",
    "both the hopping matrix element @xmath12 and the on - site interaction @xmath13 define the major energy scales of the system , which turn out to depend crucially on the strength @xmath14 of the laser field ( see appendix [ chp : para ] ) . if @xmath14 is varied , the bosons can undergo a quantum phase transition . for small @xmath14",
    "the hopping matrix element @xmath12 is large and the bosons can tunnel from site to site to explore the whole lattice .",
    "this leads to a superfluid state which is characterized by long - range correlations , a continuous excitation spectrum , and a finite compressibility .",
    "in the situation of large @xmath14 the hopping matrix element becomes negligibly small and the bosons can no longer tunnel to the neighboring sites , so the occupation number of the sites is fixed .",
    "this so - called mott phase has no long - range correlation , shows a gap in the excitation spectrum , and is nearly incompressible . in time - of - flight pictures these two phases can also be distinguished by their distinct interference patterns . in the superfluid phase",
    "the atoms are delocalized over the complete lattice . therefore , according to the heisenberg principle , their momentum uncertainty is small , which leads to sharp bragg peaks in the time - of - flight pictures . in the mott phase , on the other hand , all particles are strongly localized at lattice sites , leading to a large momentum uncertainty and ultimately to a uniform cloud during the expansion .",
    "+ it is of particular interest to determine how the location of the transition from the superfluid to the mott phase depends on the respective system parameters .",
    "usually , one assumes that the temperature in the experiments is so low that thermal effects are completely negligible . in that case",
    "the phase boundary has been determined analytically within both a mean - field theory @xcite and a strong - coupling approach @xcite as well as numerically by monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , with the field - theoretic concept of effective potential , the complete quantum phase diagram has been calculated essentially exact in excellent agreement with available numerical data @xcite .",
    "only some theoretical work has been initiated to include thermal effects in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "however , until today , a reliable method of determining the temperature of the bosons in an optical lattice is not known @xcite .",
    "therefore , more experimental and theoretical studies are needed that aim at designing a thermometer for these systems .",
    "+ this motivates the present paper where we investigate how the temperature affects the time - of - flight pictures for such a lattice system .",
    "we start in section [ chp : corr ] with determining perturbatively the correlation function for the homogeneous bose - hubbard model within the mott phase . to this end",
    "we work out a hopping expansion up to second order at finite temperatures .",
    "note that this hopping expansion is closely related to the random walk expansion worked out in refs .",
    "the resulting correlation function is used in section [ chp : tof ] to qualitatively reconstruct time - of - flight absorption pictures which are taken after switching off the one - particle potential . from this",
    "we calculate in section [ chp : visibility ] the visibility , which quantifies the contrast of the time - of - flight pictures , determine how it changes with varying lattice depth @xmath14 , and compare our results with experimental data .",
    "the appendix summarizes more technical material . in appendix [ chp :",
    "para ] we determine how the bose hubbard parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 depend on the lattice depth @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , we show that the commonly used harmonic approximation @xcite deviates significantly from numerically determined results for large lattice depth .",
    "finally , we work out in appendix [ chp : shell ] how an additional external harmonic confining potential fixes the average number of bosons per site .",
    "the time - of - flight absorption pictures rely on the correlation function @xmath15 with the partition function @xmath16 .",
    "as it is not possible to calculate this quantity analytically by exactly diagonalizing the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , we have to employ a perturbative scheme .",
    "therefore , we will restrict ourselves to the strong - coupling regime of the mott phase , where the exactly solvable on - site part @xmath17 $ ] , with the number operator @xmath18 , determines the unperturbed system and the hopping part @xmath19 can be considered a small perturbation . with this",
    "we can rewrite using the imaginary - time evolution operator in the dirac picture @xmath20 according to @xmath21 where also the partition function can be written in term of @xmath22 : @xmath23 the dirac time - evolution operator can now be expressed by the dyson series : @xmath24 with this we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zu ] ) an expansion of the partition function in powers of the tunnel matrix element @xmath12 . as",
    "the trace is only sensitive to the diagonal part and as one always needs in a cubic lattice an even number of steps to return to the starting point , all contributions with an odd power of @xmath12 must vanish leaving @xmath25 with the coefficients @xmath26 the correlation function is now calculated in the same manner by applying the dyson series , so that we end up with a perturbation series in @xmath12 : @xmath27 here the respective expansion coefficients read up to the second order in @xmath12 : @xmath28 now we have to explicitly evaluate all the respective traces . to this end",
    "we use the occupation number basis @xmath29 , in which the unperturbed system is diagonal , i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 , with the unperturbed single - site energies of the system given by @xmath32 .",
    "thus , representing the trace according to @xmath33 the coefficients of the partition function ( [ eq : z0 ] ) and ( [ eq : z1 ] ) reduce to @xmath34 analogous calculations yield the coefficients of the correlation function . with the notation @xmath35 these can be written as @xmath36 \\label{eq : c2res } \\quad , \\end{split } \\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the distance in the euclidean norm measured in units of the lattice spacing and @xmath38 is the number of next neighbors in a three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "measurements in most experiments on ultracold atomic gases are made as follows .",
    "the trapping potential is switched off allowing the gas to freely expand during a short time of flight @xmath39 . then an absorption picture is taken , which maps the particle density in real space to a plane . due to the diluteness we can neglect any interaction between the atoms , so the particles will approximately move with a constant velocity given by their momentum at the moment of release from the trap .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the condensate in the trap is point - like , so that the distribution in real space is a mirror of the distribution in momentum space connected by the relation @xmath40 .",
    "the momentum space distribution in the optical lattice is given by @xcite @xmath41 where the quasi - momentum distribution reads @xmath42 with the fourier transform of the wannier function being defined according to @xmath43 with and  we get the quasi - momentum distribution @xmath44 as @xmath45+\\ldots \\ ;",

    "the neighboring peaks especially are very faint and , furthermore , some additional unphysical peaks appear .",
    "these problems arise because the perturbation parameter @xmath69 is no longer a small quantity in the superfluid regime , so that our approximation is no longer valid .",

    "in addition , we have also neglected the existence of superfluid regions between the mott shells , but these are small and highly depleted deep in the mott regime , so this effect should not play a decisive role .",

    "[ fig : visvergleich ] an increasing discrepancy between our theoretical prediction and the experimental findings for larger lattice depths .",
    "note that a detailed analysis shows that this tendency is also present in the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy suggests an increasing temperature of the bosons in the lattice .",
    "this would support the assumption that the ramping of the optical lattice leads to an adiabatic heating of the bose gas @xcite . in order to take into account",

    "this task is certainly a nontrivial one as this adiabatic calibration curve @xmath85 should be determined across the quantum phase transition .",
    "we expect that such a calibration curve could be deduced in a consistent way within the above mentioned effective action approach @xcite .",
    "once the inhomogeneity of the trap is included , it would be possible to get a visibility curve for constant entropy , which could then be used to determine the entropy present in the experiment and , finally , to determine the temperature for certain system parameters .",
    "one could then use remaining deviations from the theory to check if any non - adiabatic heating or non - equilibrium final states occur .",
    "in this paper we calculated and analyzed the time - of - flight pictures and the resulting visibility for finite temperatures in a perturbative scheme for strong interactions going beyond the commonly used harmonic approximation .",
