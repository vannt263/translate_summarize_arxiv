    "the critical velocity of superfluid flow is one of the most fundamental issues in the physics of quantum fluids .",
    "a mechanism for the onset of dissipation is provided by landau instability @xcite : if the excitation spectrum satisfies suitable criteria , there exists a critical flow velocity above which the kinetic energy of the superfluid can be dissipated _ via _ the creation of excitations . for uniform weakly interacting bose gases , this critical velocity @xmath0 coincides with the velocity of sound waves .",
    "several experiments have already been devoted to observe and characterize the onset of dissipation in superfluids made of ultracold atomic gases , including studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in relative motion with respect to external perturbations , such as point - like defects @xcite or weak optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the present work was stimulated by the recent experiment by miller _",
    "@xcite , where a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice is used to measure the critical velocity of the superfluid flow of ultracold fermionic atoms in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the lattice is produced by two intersecting laser beams focused in the central part of the trapped gas . a frequency difference between the two beams",
    "is used to produce a relative motion of the lattice and the gas .",
    "the number of fermion pairs which remain in the superfluid after the application of the moving lattice is measured as a function of the relative velocity in order to determine the critical velocity for the onset of dissipation .",
    "the experiment confirms a theoretical prediction that superfluidity is most robust at unitarity @xcite .",
    "it also shows that the critical velocity is very sensitive to the intensity of the lattice .",
    "this shares some similarity with the flow of a superfluid in the presence of a single potential barrier . in the case of ultracold fermions in the bcs - bec crossover",
    ", the latter problem has been recently addressed in the framework of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory by spuntarelli _",
    "@xcite , who also found a strong dependence of the critical velocity on the barrier height . these works",
    "( see also , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) are recent fermionic examples of a wider field of investigations of critical current phenomena mainly studied , in the past , for bose - einstein condensed gases .",
    "we notice however that the similarities and differences between the behavior of the critical flow in the presence of a single barrier and of a periodic potential , as well as the role of quantum statistics have never been addressed in a clear and systematic way .",
    "our work is aimed to establish an appropriate framework where one can compare the different situations ( bosons vs. fermions and single barrier vs. optical lattice ) and extract useful indications for available and/or feasible experiments . to this purpose",
    "we first introduce the hydrodynamic formalism in the local density approximation ( lda ) and we assume a polytropic equation of state , which applies both to a fermi superfluid at unitarity ( i.e. , when the @xmath1-wave scattering length @xmath2 is much larger than the interparticle distance , which in turn is much larger than the range of the interatomic potential ) and to a bose - einstein condensate . in this way we derive a universal relation between the critical current for energetic instability and the maximum value of the external potential .",
    "we then compare the lda hydrodynamic prediction with the results of the numerical solutions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) and bogoliubov - de gennes equations for bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "this comparison allows us to identify different regimes of superfluid flow depending on the relevant energy and length scales of the system : a regime of hydrodynamic flow in lda , a regime of macroscopic flow beyond lda , and a regime of weakly coupled superfluids separated by thin and strong barriers . from our analysis",
    "one can see that the bdg results of ref .",
    "@xcite for fermions at unitarity nicely fall into the lda hydrodynamic regime .",
    "conversely , the parameters of the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite are such that the lda is not applicable , the healing length being of the same order of the lattice spacing .",
    "indeed we find that the experimental results are not reproduced by the lda , as expected , but we find that they also disagree with the bdg theory in a periodic potential with parameters similar to the ones of the experiment .",
    "this disagreement suggests that the interpretation of the experimental observations in terms of energetic instability of stationary superfluid flow in a uniform 1d periodic potential remains an open issue .",
    "our starting point is a hydrodynamic theory in the local density approximation at zero temperature .",
    "let us consider a superfluid which extends to infinity in three dimensions and is subject to a 1d potential , @xmath3 , which has a finite maximum value @xmath4 .",
    "let the superfluid be in a stationary configuration characterized by the density profile @xmath5 and the ( quasi- ) momentum @xmath6 along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the lda assumes that , locally , the system behaves like a uniform gas ; thus the energy density @xmath8 can be written in the form @xmath9 and one can define the local chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "the density profile of the gas at rest in the presence of the external potential can be obtained from the thomas - fermi relation @xmath11 . if the gas is flowing with a constant current density @xmath12 , the bernoulli equation for the stationary velocity field @xmath13 is @xmath14 ^ 2 + \\mu(n ) + v_{\\rm ext } ( z ) , \\label{eq : mu}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the @xmath7-independent value of the chemical potential .",
    "this equation gives the density profile , for any given current @xmath16 , once the equation of state @xmath17 of the uniform gas of density @xmath18 is known .",
    "we assume the uniform gas to obey a polytropic equation of state , @xmath19 , and we consider two cases : i ) a dilute bose gas with repulsive interaction , for which one has @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the interaction parameter , @xmath23 is the atom mass , and @xmath24 is the @xmath1-wave scattering length ; ii ) a dilute fermi gas at unitarity , for which @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a universal parameter @xcite while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the fermi energy and momentum , respectively , of a uniform non - interacting fermi gas of density @xmath18 , so that @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using the equation of state one can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the local sound velocity , which depends on @xmath7 through the density profile @xmath5 . in a uniform gas of density @xmath33 ,",

    "this means that the superfluid becomes first unstable precisely at @xmath35 .",

    "the critical velocity @xmath45 is normalized to the value of the sound velocity in the uniform gas , @xmath46 , and is plotted as a function of @xmath47 ( see appendix [ app - lda ] ) .",
    "the limit @xmath48 corresponds to the usual landau criterion for a uniform superfluid flow in the presence of a small external perturbation , i.e. , a critical velocity equal to the sound velocity of the gas . in this hydrodynamic scheme , as mentioned before , the critical velocity decreases when @xmath4 increases mainly because the density has a local depletion and the velocity has a corresponding local maximum , so that the landau instability occurs earlier .",
    "when @xmath49 , the density exactly vanishes below the barrier and hence the critical velocity goes to zero .",
    "the condition for the applicability of the lda expression ( [ eq : jc ] ) is that the typical length scale of the external potential must be much larger than the healing length @xmath50 of the superfluid . for a 1d potential barrier of width @xmath40 ,",

    "effects beyond lda become important when @xmath50 is of the same order or larger than @xmath40 ; they cause a smoothing of both density and velocity distributions , as well as the emergence of solitonic excitations , which are expected to play an important role in determining the critical velocity .",
