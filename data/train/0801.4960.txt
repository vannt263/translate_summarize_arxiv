    "initiated by work of wegner @xcite , schfer & wegner @xcite , and pruisken & schfer @xcite , non - compact non - linear sigma models as well as their supersymmetric generalizations due to efetov @xcite have long been a standard tool in the field of disordered electron physics .",
    "areas of application include single electron motion in disordered and chaotic mesoscopic systems @xcite , chaotic scattering @xcite , localization and delocalization in systems exhibiting the integer quantum hall effect @xcite , statistical properties of the dirac spectrum in non - abelian gauge field backgrounds @xcite , to mention only a few .",
    "the utility of the non - linear sigma model derives from the fact that it exposes the long - wavelength degrees of freedom of the disordered system , which are hidden in the original microscopic formulation by a hamiltonian with quenched , i.e. , time - independent , random parameters .",
    "these degrees of freedom correspond to interacting diffusion modes , known to be responsible for the universal behavior of spectral and eigenfunction statistics in a broad class of disordered systems @xcite .    while the final results are expected to exhibit a high degree of universality , the mathematical tools employed to derive the non - linear sigma model may vary depending on the type of microscopic model under consideration .",
    "a concise introduction to this issue can be found in @xcite ; see also the recent papers @xcite .",
    "for some types of microscopic model the following mathematical identity plays a key role in the derivation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant and @xmath4 denotes the lebesgue measure of a normed vector space of matrices @xmath5 . in a situation with compact orthogonal symmetry , which arises when the fermionic sector of the theory is considered , one has license to take the integration domain @xmath6 to be the real symmetric matrices @xmath5 , and it is then trivial to do the gaussian integral by completing the square and shifting variables",
    "however , for reasons reviewed in sect.[sect : background ] the bosonic sector ( say , of time - reversal invariant systems without spin ) calls for @xmath7 to be a _ non_-symmetric matrix composed of elements @xmath8 with @xmath9 real numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath12 with entries @xmath13 determines a non - compact variant @xmath14 of the real orthogonal group by the condition @xmath15 , where @xmath16 means the transpose of the matrix @xmath17 .",
    "first discovered in the present context by wegner @xcite , the group @xmath14 is sometimes referred to as the ` hyperbolic symmetry ' of the problem at hand .    in the situation with hyperbolic symmetry , choosing a good domain of integration for @xmath18 and making rigorous sense of the integral ( [ eq : hs ] ) are non - trivial tasks .",
    "the difficulty arises from the general context of the so - called hubbard - stratonovich method : the exponential @xmath19 must be kept bounded  or else the next step of the method , which is to integrate over the microscopic fields @xmath20 , would be invalid .",
    "since the real matrix @xmath7 satisfies the symmetry relation @xmath21 one might think that one should try to integrate over the domain of all real matrices @xmath18 subject to the symmetry @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting quadratic form @xmath23 is of indefinite sign and therefore such a choice of integration domain for @xmath18 makes the @xmath18-integral divergent .",
    "nonetheless , a valid solution of the problem posed by ( [ eq : hs ] ) , i.e. , a choice of integration domain for @xmath18 making the @xmath18-integral converge while keeping the integrand bounded as a function of @xmath7 , was offered in the paper by schfer and wegner @xcite ; by deforming some of the real freedoms in @xmath18 into the complex numbers they parameterize @xmath18 as @xmath24 where @xmath25 runs through the real symmetric matrices that commute with @xmath26 , the constant @xmath27 is any positive real number , and @xmath28 .",
    "the reader is referred to the review @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "now the schfer - wegner choice of domain has , besides its many merits , a certain drawback : it lacks invariance under the action of the symmetry group @xmath29",
    ". this may be the reason why the schfer - wegner choice was never much in use by the disordered electron physics community .",
    "another choice of integration domain for ( [ eq : hs ] ) , which meets the afore - mentioned requirements and also has the desirable property of @xmath14-invariance , first appeared in a paper by pruisken and schfer @xcite . beginning with @xcite",
    "this choice came to be used in numerous later works . in the present paper we are going to establish this so - called pruisken - schfer domain as a rigorous alternative to that of schfer - wegner .",
    "there exists , however , a mathematical subtlety : although our choice of domain agrees with pruisken - schfer as a union @xmath30 of _ sets _ @xmath31 , it differs as an element @xmath32 of the vector space of integration _ chains _ ( for the details , see below ) .",
    "some low - dimensional special cases of it were worked out in @xcite .",
    "the pruisken - schfer domain , @xmath6 , is an open subspace of the @xmath33-dimensional space of real matrices @xmath18 obeying the mixed symmetry relation @xmath34 .",
    "because such matrices may in general have _ complex _ eigenvalues and eigenvectors , one defines @xmath6 as the subspace of matrices @xmath35 that can be diagonalized by conjugation @xmath36 with an element @xmath37 of the _ real _ ( non - compact ) orthogonal group .",
    "this set @xmath6 turns out to be the union @xmath38 of @xmath39 sub - domains @xmath40 .",
    "the domains @xmath41 are enumerated as follows . with the exception of cases forming a set of measure zero",
    ", an @xmath1-diagonalizable matrix @xmath34 has @xmath42 ` space - like ' and @xmath43 ` time - like ' eigenvalues @xmath44  here we use the language of relativity theory to communicate that the corresponding eigenvector @xmath45 has the property @xmath46 or @xmath47 , respectively . in the generic situation without degeneracies ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath18 can be arranged in decreasing order and this ordered sequence translates into a binary sequence @xmath48 by writing , say , the symbols @xmath49 for space - like and @xmath50 for time - like eigenvalues .",
    "the binary sequence @xmath48 encoding the relative order of space - like and time - like eigenvalues is an @xmath1-invariant .",
    "moreover , collisions between eigenvalues of space - like and time - like type generically lead to the birth of complex eigenvalues , thereby taking us outside the integration domain for @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the @xmath14-diagonalizable matrices @xmath18 of binary sequence @xmath48 form an @xmath1-invariant domain , which we denote by @xmath31 , and any two such domains @xmath41 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 can only touch each other in subspaces of lower dimension ( more precisely , of codimension two ) .",
    "the integration measure @xmath4 is defined to be the flat one for all domains @xmath31 : @xmath53 now the startling feature of the following statement is that the integral on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : hs ] ) is proposed to be a sum of integrals @xmath54 with _ alternating _ sign !    [ thm:1 ] there exists some choice of cutoff function @xmath55 ( converging pointwise to unity as @xmath56 ) , and a unique choice of sign function @xmath57 and a constant @xmath58 such that @xmath59 holds true for all matrices @xmath60 with the positivity property @xmath61 .",
    "it will be shown that @xmath62 is the parity of the number of transpositions @xmath63 needed to reduce the binary sequence @xmath48 to the extremal form @xmath64 .",
    "it should be emphasized that ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) is _ not _ a standard gaussian integral ; in fact , we have not succeeded in finding a proof of this formula by completing the square and shifting .",
    "it is informative to give an alternative expression for the integral ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) in terms of the eigenvalues of @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the volume element transforms as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is a positive haar measure for the connected group @xmath71 .",
    "the jacobian is @xmath72    [ cor:1 ] let a function @xmath73 with alternating sign on @xmath74 be defined by @xmath75 then , assuming the positivity @xmath76 of the matrix @xmath77 , we have @xmath78    the first @xmath42 eigenvalues @xmath79 are space - like , the last @xmath43 time - like . to deduce cor .",
    "[ cor:1 ] from thm .",
    "[ thm:1 ] , we need only observe that the function @xmath73 differs from the jacobian @xmath80 precisely by our sign function @xmath81 : @xmath82 the presence of this alternating sign factor was conjectured in @xcite ; see also @xcite .    in previous work ,",
    "beginning with @xcite , the identity of cor.[cor:1 ] was assumed to hold without the alternating sign .",
    "it became apparent in 1995 that this assumption was unfounded @xcite though it remained unclear at that time how to correct the mistake .",
    "problems with the pruisken - schfer domain were mentioned in @xcite , but for various reasons the issue was never much emphasized in the published literature .",
    "( for one thing , all results derived using @xmath80 instead of @xmath73 stand correct after saddle - point approximation for large @xmath83 , as the integral in the large-@xmath83 limit is dominated by contributions from a single domain @xmath31 . for another , the schfer - wegner domain was available @xcite as a rigorous alternative in order to do all intermediate steps correctly . )",
    "the present paper solves this long standing problem in a satisfactory if perhaps surprising manner .",
    "let it be pointed out that the matrix @xmath84 appearing in applications is not strictly positive but positive _ semi_-definite .",
    "this is , however , a minor issue as an easy variant of the formula ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) takes care of the semi - definite case ; see @xcite for the details .    for the related case of non - compact unitary symmetry @xmath85 a formula analogous to that of cor .",
    "[ cor:1 ] had been established in @xcite , using the special feature of semiclassical exactness by the duistermaat - heckman theorem @xcite .",
    "although it will not be shown here , the methods of the present paper are robust and can be adapted to handle the case of @xmath86 as well , without taking recourse to semiclassical exactness .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : background ] we present some background material concerning the hubbard - stratonovich method .",
    "basic results needed from integral calculus are collected in sect .",
    "[ sect : basics ] .",
    "then , in sect",
    ".  [ sect:1,1 ] , we work out the simple but instructive case of @xmath87 in detail .",
    "the case of general @xmath42 and @xmath43 is handled in sect .",
    "[ sect : p , q ] by reduction to @xmath87 .",
    "to make the present paper self - contained , we now describe the steps prior to ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) , called the hubbard - stratonovich transformation in the present context . although the true power of this transformation is to allow the treatment of non - trivial models with _ local _",
    "@xmath88 gauge symmetry @xcite or even without such symmetry @xcite , we will restrict ourselves here to reviewing the basic steps at the example of the simplest random matrix model of this universality class : the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .    in the present work we are concerned with time - reversal invariant systems without spin . for such systems ,",
    "the quantum mechanics of stationary states can be done over the field @xmath89 of real numbers .",
    "assuming the real hilbert space to be of finite dimension , @xmath83 , we may express the hamiltonian operators @xmath90 by real symmetric @xmath91 matrices .",
    "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble by definition is an @xmath88-invariant probability measure @xmath92 on the space of such matrices . for our purposes ,",
    "the goe measure @xmath92 is best characterized by its fourier transform : @xmath93 where the fourier variable @xmath94 is any symmetric matrix , and @xmath95 is a parameter",
    ".    an important object of the theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is the expectation value of the reciprocal of a product of ( square roots of ) characteristic polynomials of @xmath96 @xmath97 we assume that @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 . to compute such an expectation value",
    ", we use the trick of representing the reciprocal square root of each determinant as a gaussian integral over vector variables @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 and the factor @xmath105 ensures the convergence of the integral .",
    "@xmath106 means the euclidean scalar product of @xmath107 .    substituting such integrals into ( [ 2 ] )",
    ", one immediately performs the goe average by employing the characteristic property ( [ eq : goe ] ) .",
    "the result can then be expressed in terms of a matrix @xmath108 of size @xmath109 with entries @xmath110 @xmath111    here is where the identity ( [ eq : hs ] ) comes in : it enables us to linearize the quadratic term @xmath112 in the exponent , thereby reducing the integral over the @xmath83-component vectors @xmath113 to @xmath83 decoupled gaussian integrals , one for each component @xmath114 . when the latter integrals are carried out , ( [ 4 ] ) becomes an integral over the collective variables @xmath18 only . using the rigorous form ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) of the relation ( [ eq : hs ] ) we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 and , with the assumption that @xmath83 is large enough , the cutoff function @xmath117 has been removed by sending the regularization parameter @xmath118 to zero .    the integral representation ( [ eq : intrep ] ) for @xmath119 is well suited for saddle - point analysis in the limit of large @xmath83 .",
    "we can now appreciate why the identity ( [ eq : hs ] ) is useful here : it serves the purpose of exposing the good variables in which to perform the large-@xmath83 limit .",
    "let this fact suffice as a motivation for our labors in the body of this paper .",
    "recalling from sect .  [ sect : result ] the definition of the connected domains @xmath41 ( cf .  also below )",
    "we consider the following alternating sum of integrals : @xmath120 where @xmath117 is some smooth cutoff function which regularizes the integral and converges pointwise to unity in the limit @xmath121 .",

    "we shall prove that the integral @xmath122 does not depend on the matrix @xmath7 , or equivalently , that all of its directional derivatives vanish : @xmath123 once ( [ eq : indep ] ) has been established , the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( [ eq : thm1 ] ) follows by multiplying both sides of ( [ eq : sum1 ] ) with a constant @xmath124 .    to prepare our treatment , we recall a few basic facts from calculus . given a vector field @xmath45 on an @xmath125-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath126 ,",

    "for a differential form @xmath134 on @xmath126 let @xmath135 denote the pullback of @xmath136 by @xmath137 .",
    "the lie derivative of @xmath136 w.r.t .",
    "the vector field @xmath45 is then defined by differentiation at @xmath138 @xmath139 by the relation @xmath140 , the lie derivative satisfies the leibniz rule @xmath141 .",

    "we need to develop a good understanding of the boundary components @xmath170 and the twisted form @xmath171 restricted to them . as a first step ,",
    "we illustrate the essential features of the argument at the example of the symmetry group being @xmath172 .",
    "this example plays a very important role as the general case will be handled by reduction to it .",
    "here we are going to deal with the special case of real @xmath174 matrices @xmath18 subject to the linear symmetry relation @xmath175 where @xmath176 means the operation of taking the matrix transpose .",
    "such matrices can be parameterized by three real variables @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 as @xmath180 thus our space of matrices @xmath18 is isomorphic as a vector space to @xmath181 .",
    "the measure of integration is the positive density @xmath182 .",
    "the matrix @xmath7 is of the same form as @xmath18 but its matrix elements are constrained by @xmath183    another way of describing the setting is to equip the real vector space @xmath184 with the sign - indefinite bilinear form @xmath185 determined by @xmath186 @xmath187 the matrices @xmath18 are then symmetric with respect to @xmath185 in the sense that @xmath188 for all @xmath189 .",
    "we denote the linear space of real matrices @xmath18 with this symmetry property by @xmath190 .",
    "since @xmath185 has signature @xmath191 , the symmetry group of @xmath185 is the non - compact real orthogonal group @xmath192 .",
    "elements @xmath193 satisfy the equation @xmath194 which is equivalent to saying that @xmath195 for all @xmath196 .    for reasons indicated in the introduction ( see sect.[sect : intro ] )  let us recall that in order for the integral ( [ eq : hs ] ) to exist one needs the inequality @xmath197 , at least asymptotically  we want our matrices @xmath198 to be diagonalizable by the action @xmath199 of the real group @xmath173 by conjugation . the condition of diagonalizability is formulated most clearly by expressing @xmath18 in a basis of light - like vectors of @xmath184 : @xmath200 which obey @xmath201 and @xmath202 . applying @xmath18 to this basis one has @xmath203 where @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 .",
    "since the diagonal piece of @xmath18 in this basis is a multiple of unity , the condition for diagonalizability is that the product of off - diagonal matrix elements be positive : @xmath207 .",
    "the domain @xmath208 of @xmath173-diagonalizability of our matrices @xmath209 consists of two connected components : @xmath210 the motivation for the notation ( @xmath211 ) will become clear shortly . here",
    "we simply remark that if @xmath212 denotes a pair of @xmath18-eigenvectors with @xmath213 and @xmath214 are the associated eigenvalues , then @xmath215 for @xmath216 and @xmath217 for @xmath218 .",

    "4 half - planes @xmath228 and @xmath229 be defined by @xmath230 @xmath228 and @xmath229 make up the boundary of @xmath41 ( for both @xmath231 and @xmath232 ) .",
    "being part of @xmath233 , the half - plane @xmath234 inherits from @xmath235 an outer orientation by the transverse vector field @xmath236 .",

    "the crucial point now is that the integral over @xmath271 vanishes in the limit @xmath121 . indeed , writing @xmath283 for short , the @xmath271-integral gives @xmath284 and this does go to zero for @xmath285 as long as the real number @xmath286 is non - zero .",

    ", we drop the absolute value on @xmath319 and integrate against the sign - alternating distribution @xmath320 .",
    "more precisely , we take the @xmath321 integration to be the inner one ( this obviates the need for regularization albeit at the expense of fubini s theorem becoming inapplicable , so that the order of integrations is now fixed and can no longer be changed ) .",

    "we now turn to the general case of real matrices @xmath18 of size @xmath332 , @xmath333 where the blocks @xmath334 and @xmath335 are symmetric . such matrices @xmath18 as a whole satisfy the linear symmetry relation @xmath336 equivalently , if we equip the real vector space @xmath74 with the indefinite bilinear form @xmath337 then our matrices @xmath18 form the linear space @xmath338 of @xmath185-symmetric matrices , i.e. , @xmath339 the symmetry group of the bilinear form @xmath185 with signature @xmath340 is the non - compact real orthogonal group @xmath14 of matrices @xmath17 satisfying the equation @xmath341 or equivalently , @xmath195 for all @xmath342 .    we still want our matrices @xmath343 to be diagonalizable by the @xmath14-action @xmath344 . in the simple case @xmath87 we saw that diagonalizability fails when the off - diagonal block @xmath345 is larger than the difference of the diagonal blocks @xmath334 and @xmath346 . a similar phenomenon is expected to occur for general @xmath347 . roughly speaking , @xmath18 will fail to have real eigenvectors and eigenvalues when the degree of non - hermiticity coming from the off - diagonal blocks becomes too large .      in the hubbard - stratonovich integral ( [ eq : sum1 ] ) we integrate over the set , @xmath6 , of @xmath343 that can be brought to diagonal form by the @xmath348-action , i.e. , matrices of the form @xmath349 with @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "we know from our considerations for @xmath299 that @xmath6 decomposes into connected sets @xmath41 whose boundaries intersect in lower - dimensional sets ( of codimension 2 ) . here",
    "we describe these connected components @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath349 be @xmath14-diagonalizable in the sense just described , so that the @xmath352 column vectors which make up @xmath17 form a basis of @xmath74 consisting of eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath353 denote the @xmath354 column of @xmath17 .",
    "then by the equation @xmath355 the vector @xmath356 has positive norm square @xmath357 for @xmath358 and negative norm square @xmath359 for @xmath360 . to distinguish between these two cases , we use the language of relativity theory and call the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath361 of ` space - like ' type in the former case and time - like in the latter .    assuming that we are in the generic situation , where all eigenvalues @xmath361 of @xmath18 differ from each other , we can arrange them as a descending sequence .",
    "given any such sequence , we assign to it a motif , @xmath48 : if an eigenvalue of the ordered sequence is space - like , then we represent it as a full dot , otherwise as an empty dot .",
    "thus our motifs @xmath48 are sequences of @xmath42 full and @xmath43 empty dots ; e.g. , @xmath362 is a motif for @xmath363 .    with each motif",
    "@xmath48 we now associate a domain @xmath41 as follows . while insisting that eigenvalues of opposite type ( space - like vs.  time - like ) must never be equal , we lift the condition of non - degeneracy of eigenvalues partially : eigenvalues of the same type are now allowed to collide and exchange positions , but eigenvalues of opposite type still are not . this rule of eigenvalue motion defines a connected domain @xmath41 for each @xmath364 .",
    "we define a sign function @xmath365 by setting @xmath366 where @xmath125 is the number of transpositions @xmath367 which are needed to reduce @xmath48 to the reference motif @xmath368 made of @xmath43 empty dots following @xmath42 full dots .",
    "the parity of this number @xmath125 is well - defined although @xmath125 itself is not .",

    "as was explained above , a point in the interior of @xmath41 is a matrix @xmath372 which is diagonalizable by the @xmath14-action and has eigenvalues that order according to the motif @xmath48  in particular , no two eigenvalues of opposite type are equal .",
    "this means that if @xmath373 is a continuous curve which starts in @xmath41 but leads to a collision of two or more eigenvalues of opposite type at @xmath374 , then @xmath375 is a point in the boundary of @xmath31 .",
    "the generic boundary situation is that ( i ) exactly two eigenvalues of opposite type collide , ( ii ) the norms of the two corresponding eigenvectors go to zero , and ( iii ) the boundary point @xmath375 is a matrix which fails to be diagonalizable by any real transformation @xmath376 .    to carry out the computations leading to the desired result ( [ eq : indep ] ) , we need a good description of the interior of @xmath377 as well as the boundary @xmath378 .",
    "this is achieved as follows .",
    "let us first make a slight change of perspective : abandoning the viewpoint of @xmath18 as a matrix , we switch to regarding @xmath18 as an invariantly defined linear operator ( giving rise to a matrix when expressed w.r.t .  some fixed basis )",

    "hence , recalling the expression @xmath570 and assembling factors , we see that @xmath571 for fixed @xmath430 is proportional to the form @xmath572 ( with constant coefficient ) along @xmath469 and @xmath573 ( still with constant coefficient ) along @xmath566 . in other words ,",
    "the inner dependence ( along @xmath469 and @xmath470 ) of the integration form @xmath574 is the same as in sect.[sect:4.3 ] .",
