    "suppose @xmath0 is a closed , connected , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold such that @xmath1 is infinite .",
    "the `` universal covering conjecture '' states that the universal covering space @xmath2 of @xmath0 must be homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that @xmath2 is an irreducible , contractible , open 3-manifold @xcite . a * whitehead manifold * is an irreducible , contractible , open 3-manifold which is not homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the universal covering conjecture is equivalent to the statement that whitehead manifolds can not cover closed 3-manifolds .",
    "in @xcite the author proved that `` genus one '' whitehead manifolds can not non - trivially cover other 3-manifolds , even non - compact ones .",
    "wright @xcite extended this result to the much larger class of `` eventually end - irreducible '' whitehead manifolds , a class which includes all those whitehead manifolds which are monotone unions of cubes with a bounded number of handles .",
    "tinsley and wright @xcite gave specific examples of whitehead manifolds which are not eventually end - irreducible and can not non - trivially cover any other 3-manifolds .",
    "they also constructed an uncountable family of whitehead manifolds which are infinite cyclic covering spaces of other 3-manifolds and deduced from the countability of the set of homeomorphism types of closed 3-manifolds that there must be uncountably many of these which can not cover closed 3-manifolds ; however their methods did not establish which ones these were . in @xcite",
    "the author constructed a different uncountable family of whitehead manifolds which are infinite cyclic covering spaces of other 3-manifolds and used different techniques to prove that none of them covers a closed 3-manifold .",
    "this paper combines the methods of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to give a much larger class than in @xcite of specific whitehead manifolds which do not cover closed 3-manifolds but may non - trivially cover other non - compact 3-manifolds , namely the class of `` strong end sums along a locally finite tree '' of eventually end - irreducible whitehead manifolds .",
    "in fact it is shown that whenever such a manifold covers a 3-manifold the group of covering translations must be a free group ( theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "moreover for any countable free group there are uncountably many specific examples of orientable , irreducible open 3-manifolds whose fundamental groups are isomorphic to the given group and whose universal covering spaces belong to this class and are pairwise non - homeomorphic ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "there are also uncountably many specific examples in this class which can be only infinite cyclic covering spaces of 3-manifolds and uncountably many specific examples which can not non - trivially cover any 3-manifold .",
    "the results of @xcite use a theorem of geoghegan and mihalik @xcite which implies that whenever a whitehead manifold @xmath4 covers an orientable 3-manifold the group of covering translations must inject into the mapping class group of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath4 covers a closed , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold then the group of covering translations must be finitely generated and torsion - free . in @xcite",
    "the examples were constructed so that every finitely generated , torsion - free subgroup of their mapping class groups must have a subgroup of finite index which either has infinite abelianization or a non - trivial normal abelian subgroup .",
    "results of waldhausen @xcite , hass - rubinstein - scott @xcite , mess @xcite , casson - jungreis @xcite , and gabai @xcite were then quoted which imply that a closed , orientable , irreducible 3-manifold with such a fundamental group must have universal covering space homeomorphic to @xmath3 .",
    "the present paper avoids the use of the geoghegan - mihalik result and the requisite analysis of the mapping class group . for the class of whitehead manifolds under consideration results of @xcite",
    "are used to show that the group of covering translations acts on a certain simplicial tree .",
    "the orbit lemma of @xcite and the special ratchet lemma of @xcite are then used to prove that this action fixes no vertices , from which the result follows .",
    "we remark that the methods by which tinsley and wright apply these lemmas in their proof of theorem 5.3 of @xcite could be adapted to prove this fact .",
    "however , we present a different , somewhat more direct argument which is closer in spirit to wright s proof of the main theorem of @xcite .",
    "we also give an alternative , somewhat shorter proof of the special case of the orbit lemma that we use .",
    "the whitehead manifolds considered in @xcite , @xcite , and this paper are all `` end sums '' of whitehead manifolds ; they are obtained by gluing together a collection of whitehead manifolds in a certain way ( see the next section for the precise definition ) .",
    "the summands in @xcite are members of a certain uncountable collection of genus one whitehead manifolds discovered by mcmillan @xcite ; the summands in @xcite are members of a different uncountable collection of genus one whitehead manifolds chosen so that the mapping class group of the end sum will have the appropriate structure as described above .",
    "however , the main difference is not in the summands , but in how they are glued together .",
    "the examples of @xcite are all `` strong '' end sums which have a certain `` rigidity up to isotopy '' in their construction .",
    "the end sums in @xcite are not strong end sums ; in fact it follows from proposition 2.1 below that these manifolds can not be expressed in any way as strong end sums , even though by proposition 2.2 below their summands can be glued together in a different fashion to obtain different manifolds which are strong end sums .",
    "thus the results of this paper apply to all the examples of @xcite but none of the examples of @xcite .",
    "the question of which of them can not cover closed 3-manifolds ( conjecturally all of them ) is still open .",
    "for general background on 3-manifold topology see @xcite or @xcite . we denote the manifold theoretic boundary and interior of a manifold @xmath0 by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we denote the topological boundary , interior , and closure of a submanifold @xmath0 of a manifold @xmath7 by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively , with the subscript deleted when @xmath7 is clear from the context .",

    "we obtain the 2-tangle @xmath183 in figure 3 , which thus has excellent exterior .",
    "we next identify the disks which are the left and right sides of the rectangular solid @xmath110 in figures 2 and 3 to obtain a solid torus @xmath35 .",
