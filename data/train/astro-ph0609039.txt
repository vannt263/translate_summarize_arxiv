    "deep blank - field surveys conducted with the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) have resolved as much as 50 per cent ( depending on the survey depth ) of the far - infrared background ( fib ) into discrete , high redshift - sources with flux density levels of @xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "intensive campaigns to study these submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) and millimetre galaxies at other wavelengths have shown that they are primarily powered by star - formation , although many do harbour an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; @xcite ) .",
    "the implied star - formation rates are extremely high ( 100@xmath6 ) , and since the well - known local radio / far - infrared correlation @xcite apparently holds for these higher redshift sources ( e.g  @xcite ) , the high submillimetre luminosities result in correspondingly high radio luminosities , which are detected in deep 1.4ghz images . the resolution afforded by radio - interferometers results in precise optical identifications of @xmath7 of all known smgs , and in this manner",
    "@xcite derive a median redshift of @xmath8 for the population using deep keck spectroscopy .",
    "while much of what is known about smgs is based on the radio detected subset @xcite , other studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) find no significant differences in the radio - undetected population .",
    "many investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have suggested that smgs are likely to be associated with an early - phase in the formation of massive galaxies .",
    "the intensity of their starbursts , the resulting high metallicity , along with their large dynamical masses , high gas fractions and inferred strong clustering ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) are all suggestive of a close link to the formation phase of the most massive spheroids ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    despite this progress , the samples being used in any given study are typically quite small , since scuba could only detect roughly one smg per night in good weather conditions . and",
    "while the total number of smgs detected over the lifetime of the instrument is now @xmath9 , these are mainly drawn from small ( @xmath10 square arcminute ) fields spread all over the sky , each observed and reduced by different groups using different techniques and source identification criteria . the desire to obtain a well characterised sample of hundreds of smgs in a large , contiguous area was the motivation for the scuba half - degree extragalactic survey ( shades ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "shades is an ambitious wide extragalactic submillimetre survey , split evenly between 2 separate regions of sky : the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep field ( sxdf ) and the lockman hole east ( lh ) .",
    "the aim was to map @xmath11 ( @xmath12 times the area of its predecessor , the scuba 8-mjy survey ; @xcite ) to a comparable depth of @xmath13 at @xmath0 , which is roughly three times the @xmath14 confusion limit imposed by the underlying sea of fainter unresolved sources in the coarse scuba beam ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the survey began in late 2002 , and finished when scuba was decomissioned in late 2005 .",
    "shades is the largest survey in terms of observing time carried out with scuba .",
    "many scientifically powerful results from shades will come from comparisons of the properties of sources found in the shades catalogue with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "some of these include radio identifications ( ivison et al . in preparation ) , fir - radio photometric redshift estimates ( aretxaga et al . in preparation ) , and submillimetre - spitzer - based seds and photometric redshifts ( clements et al . , eales et al . and serjeant et al . in preparation ) . in this paper",
    "we present new constraints on the numbers of submillimetre sources as a function of @xmath4 flux density based on the shades catalogues . a complementary analysis effort to constrain the numbers of faint submillimetre sources directly from our maps without the intermediate step of making a catalogue , a so - called @xmath15 approach ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "will be reported separately .",
    "the main results presented in this paper are the shades catalogue and 850@xmath16 m  number counts .",
    "the observations are summarised in section  [ obsdr ] .",
    "section  [ dr ] provides details about the data reduction . for the first time in a submillimetre survey",
    "the data are processed by four independent data reduction pipelines in order to increase the robustness of the results . in section  [ compareall ] , the amalgamation of the four source lists into a master @xmath4 shades catalogue",
    "is described . in section",
    "[ complete ] two different approaches to derive the number counts are described , compared and contrasted .",
    "the shades differential count measurements are provided here . in section  [ numcts ] , models are fit to the differential counts , and the cumulative source counts are computed in order to compare them with previous data .",
    "concluding remarks regarding what was learned about data analysis by comparing the different reductions , as well as advice for future surveys , are given in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the subaru/_xmm - newton _ deep field ( sxdf ) and lockman hole east ( lh ) regions are centred at ( j2000 ) ra=@xmath17 , dec=@xmath18 and ra=@xmath19 , dec=@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "they were observed with a resolution of 14.8 arcsec and 7.5 arcsec at 850 and @xmath21 , respectively , with scuba ( @xcite ) on the 15-m jcmt atop mauna kea in hawaii .",
    "a detailed account of the survey design and observing strategy is given in @xcite but is summarised briefly here .",
    "the observing strategy consists of making three overlapping jiggle maps for each of six different chop throws ( 30 , 44 and @xmath22 ) and chop position angle ( pa , 0 and @xmath23 in ra / dec coordinates ) combinations , motivated by @xcite .",
    "each set of six observations spans a range of airmass values , while the observations are limited to a @xmath24 atmospheric opacity range of @xmath25 , so as to maintain uniform coverage over the entire survey area . the shades survey data collection took place between 1998 march and 2005 june ( including the epoch of existing data from the lh portion of the scuba 8-mjy survey , @xcite , @xcite ) .    after a series of technical problems ,",
    "scuba was officially decommissioned in 2005 july , with only a modest amount of shades data taken in its last year . only scuba data taken up until 2004 february 1 , covering a total area of @xmath1 down to an rms noise level of @xmath26 ,",
    "are included here .",
    "the sky coverage is approximately evenly distributed between the two shades fields .",
    "complete scuba shades maps will contain only an additional roughly 7 per cent of the planned area , although these will be complemented with @xmath27 aztec data @xcite which will be presented in a future paper .",
    "in order to ensure the utmost robustness of the resulting @xmath4 source catalogue , data reduction was independently carried out by four sub - groups drawn from within the shades consortium ; we refer to these as reductions a , b , c and d. this provides an unprecedented degree of reliability with respect to other scuba source catalogues available from the literature .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath28 data , which are only of limited use , is discussed in appendix  [ 450umfluxes ] .",
    "a major strength of the shades analysis comes from the concordance of these reductions which have _ not _ been modified to bring them into agreement .",
    "all groups perform the basic reduction steps of combining the nods ( i.e.  re - switching ) , flat - fielding , extinction correcting , despiking , removing the sky signal , calibrating , rebinning the data into pixel grids , and finally extracting sources .",
    "all reduction groups also correct the astrometry of the sxdf observations prior to december 26 , 2002 by @xmath29 arcsec in declination , in order to account for a jcmt pointing catalogue error for oceti . for all data taken on or after 2002",
    "december 6 the known dead bolometer ` g9 ' was manually removed from further analysis .",
    "groups dealt with the presence of a 16 sample noise spike in the data in different ways , as first noted by @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; this is further discussed in appendix  [ noisespike ] .",
    "reduction steps were performed by each group independently using some combination of surf ( scuba user reduction facility ; @xcite ) and their own locally - developed codes .",
    "the basic steps of the analysis procedure are described in @xcite .",
    "each reduction group has made different choices with respect to various detailed steps , which are described in table [ procedures ] .",
    "several of the choices merit attention and are discussed below .    the teams each produce signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) maps convolved with the telescope point spread function .",
    "this procedure is mathematically equivalent to fitting the point spread function ( psf ) to the data centred on each pixel and is the minimum variance estimator of the brightness of isolated point sources if the background noise is white ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in all four reductions ,",
    "flux density measured when bolometers in the ` off - beam chop ' of the telescope point at the region in question has essentially been folded in to the likelihood maps in order to increase the sensitivity of the maps .",
    "two approaches have been used here : ( 1 ) fitting each pixel in the map to the multi - beam psf ; or ( 2 ) folding in the flux from the off - beams in the timestream data and then fitting each pixel in the map to a single gaussian .",
    "after calibrating , the final map noise rms values for the lh and sxdf fields are 2.1 and @xmath30 , respectively .    finally , the presence of the 16 sample noise spike does not warrant any major pipeline alterations , since its effect on these data was found to be almost negligible ; an account of the investigation into this issue is presented in appendix  [ noisespike ] .",
    "several different checks were performed to test the gaussianity of the noise and to check individual source robustness by examining spatial and temporal fits to point sources in the maps and this analysis is presented in appendix  [ tests ] .",
    "the dominant cause of variation in the multiplicative factor between detector voltage and inferred source flux density is temporal variation in the atmospheric opacity . in all four reductions detector voltages",
    "are divided by the atmospheric opacity inferred , using coefficients in @xcite , from either the @xmath24 @xmath31 measurements or the @xmath32 line of sight water vapour monitor ( wvm ; @xcite ) at the jcmt .",
    "the differences in strategy described in table  [ procedures ] do not lead to measurable differences in the data .",
    "largely because of shades , there is a substantial body of data correlating opacity measured via secant scans ( ` sky dips ' ) for various chop - throws with the opacity inferred from measurements of the @xmath31 or the jcmt wvm .",
    "opacity monitors provide a lower noise measurement of opacity than is provided by any single sky - dip and do not cost any observing time ( and are therefore preferred ) .",
    "the flux conversion factor ( fcf ) converts opacity - corrected bolometer voltages to flux densities .",
    "it is essentially the receiver responsivity .",
    "the fcf is fairly stable on both short and long time scales , but might depart from the long term average as the telescope mirror is distorted by thermal gradients near to sunset and sunrise @xcite . because the fcf at @xmath4 is so stable ,",
    "the long term average might be a better estimator of the fcf at a given moment than any single measurement taken during stable conditions ( monthly average fcf values have been tabulated on the jcmt website , and were used to calibrate the data in reduction d ) . over - reliance on individual fcf measurements could inject noise into the analysis . however , reduction b , which makes the most use of measured fcf values , produces maps whose noise is as low as the other reductions",
    ".      reductions a and b make ` zero - footprint ' maps using an optimal noise - weighted drizzling algorithm ( essentially the limiting form of the method of @xcite ) with a pixel size of @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "reductions c and d use @xmath34 pixels .",
    "the pressure to use larger pixels is driven by the observation of @xcite that statistical analysis becomes unpredictable when there are too few observations per pixel .",
    "the concern that large pixels might lead to larger uncertainty in the positions of the detected sources is not supported in the data ( as discussed in section  [ compareposition ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to determine how frequently the stacked flux density measurements would occur given the number of @xmath4 sources in each field , 10,000 monte carlo simulations were performed with uniformly - selected random positions in the reduction d maps .",
    "a stacked flux density greater than or equal to the measured value at the @xmath4-selected positions ( strategy 1 ) occurs @xmath35 of the time at random in both fields .",
    "the simulations therefore indicate a significant detection of the shades catalogue of @xmath4-selected galaxies at @xmath28 .",
    "another indication that we have marginally detected the @xmath4 sources at @xmath28 , is shown by the slight positive skewness in the distribution of s / n values at the @xmath4 shades catalogue positions ( as shown in fig .  [ fig:450hist ] ) .",
    "the simulations were then repeated for strategy 2 , searching for the nearest @xmath28 peak within @xmath36 of the shades catalogue @xmath4 positions .",
    "we found that a value above the measured stacked value occurred 90 ( 22 ) per cent of the time in the lh ( sxdf ) field .",
    "the stacked @xmath28 flux density obtained using strategy 2 is therefore not high enough compared with the monte carlos ( which pick up @xmath28 noise peaks within the @xmath36 search radius ) to be regarded as statistically significant .",
    "the ratio of stacked @xmath28 flux density to @xmath4 flux density of shades catalogue sources is around 22.5 , depending on the precise choice of data and reduction ( and including the effect of @xmath4 flux deboosting ) .",
    "this ratio is low compared to what one would expect , independent of any reasonable choice for a redshifted sample of local sed templates ( which typically yield @xmath37 ) .",
    "we found that fitting a range of template galaxies from @xcite yielded redshifts @xmath38 for the population , which is higher than that found for smgs .",
    "this result of low stacked @xmath28 flux density is consistent with that found for smgs in the goods - n field @xcite and suggests a systematic bias when pushing scuba data to these faint stacked values .",
    "the @xmath28 stacking analysis was also carried out at the positions of the preliminary sub - sample of radio - identified sources ( see section  [ compareposition ] ) , and compared with the results of an analysis at the positions of the non - radio - identified sub - sample .",
    "note that the radio - detected smgs are more likely to be detected at @xmath28 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the stacked @xmath28 flux densities at the @xmath4 positions of the sources with radio ids are similar to the stacked @xmath28 flux densities at the radio positions .",
    "this implies that moving to the positions of the proposed radio identifications ( which one might expect would provide a more accurate measure of the true source positions ) does not actually raise the average @xmath28 flux density significantly for the same subset of sources .",
    "however , a marked difference was found between the stacked @xmath28 flux densities of the radio - identified subset and the non - radio - identified subset .",
    "this result may be explained by one of the following : ( 1 ) the non - radio - identified subset lies at a higher redshift on average ; or ( 2 ) there are spurious sources in the non - radio - identified subset , diluting the @xmath28 stacked flux density measurement ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since there is no evidence that the radio - identified shades sources are more likely to be real , the radio - identified subset is probably biased to lower redshifts @xcite , yielding a higher @xmath39 ratio .",

    "<S> we present differential and integral source number counts and find that the differential counts are better fit with a broken power - law or a schechter function than with a single power - law ; the shades data alone significantly show that a break is required at several mjy , although the precise position of the break is not well constrained . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that an @xmath4 survey complete down to @xmath2 would resolve 2030 per cent of the far - ir background into point sources .    </S>",
