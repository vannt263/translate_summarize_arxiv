    "currently , this understanding is limited by too little knowledge of the molecular - level structure and dynamics at interfaces .",
    "most experimental work has come from macroscopic electrochemical measurements where inferring molecular - level details is challenging  @xcite , or surface science measurements at ultrahigh vacuum conditions , where processes relevant to condensed phase behavior are absent  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical work has utilized quantum chemical methods designed to produce highly accurate representations of one ( or a few ) configurations , like that reviewed in refs .   and .",
    "that type of study neglects fluctuations , relaxation and solvation . here",
    ", we adopt a complimentary perspective , following in the footsteps of refs .  , employing classical molecular dynamics simulations to study large - length scale correlations and long - time scale dynamics .",
    "we use these methods to study the dynamics of exchange between water molecules in the bulk liquid with water molecules tightly bound to a platinum electrode .",
    "we show how the bound water molecules organize into an adlayer with long - lived disordered spatial patterns extending over large distances .",
    "similarly , we show how the bulk water molecules adjacent to the monolayer form a soft liquid interface that can accommodate long wavelength distortions in the local interfacial density .",
    "the exchange between the bulk and the bound waters involves the dynamics of both the adlayer and the soft liquid interface .",
    "the exchange process is rare , occurring with a characteristic timescale on the order of tens of nanoseconds .",
    "it is collective , proceeding through a reaction coordinate that involves reorganization of many adlayer molecules in concert with fluctuations of the soft liquid interface .",
    "this work highlights that in the vicinity of an aqueous electrode interface , even the simplest kinetic processes become highly collective .",
    "it is in line with our previous work that showed how an aqueous electrode interface exhibits an array of emergent behaviors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , large binding energies pin water molecules to the surface resulting in a water adlayer in which hydrogen bonding is passivated almost entirely within the plane of the electrode .",
    "this in - plane hydrogen bonding greatly reduces interactions between the adlayer and surrounding liquid , producing a composite water - metal surface that is hydrophobic .",
    "the composite surface attracts defects from the bulk liquid like excess protons,@xcite and weakly solvated ions@xcite , and it facilitates large density fluctuations in the adjacent bulk liquid  @xcite .",
    "further , when surface periodicities and local coordinations of the electrode surface are incommensurate with favorable hydrogen bonding geometries , hydrogen - bonding patterns of the adlayer are frustrated , leading to structures with localized defects and heterogeneous dynamics  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the dynamics at this interface is governed by a hierarchy of timescales , spanning picoseconds to tens of nanoseconds .",
    "the shortest of these timescales characterize molecular fluctuations in the bulk liquid , the longest characterize relaxation of the adsorbed water monolayer  @xcite .",
    "these fast and slow degrees of freedom are coupled through fluctuations of the bulk - monolayer interface that itself relaxes over intermediate timescales  @xcite .",
    "this complexity affects the exchange of a water molecule between the adsorbed monolayer and the bulk , and as such , it also affects the accessibility of reactive sites on a hydrated electrode . recognizing this fact , hansen et al introduce phenomenological energy barriers in their treatment of oxygen evolution  @xcite .",
    "these barriers are attributed to entropic effects related to surface water reorganization , highlighting the role of slow interfacial water dynamics .",
    "related effects may be important in gas phase catalysis as well because a similar monolayer of water forms on platinum surfaces exposed to ambient air .",
    "slow reorganization of this monolayer has been conjectured to account for the low sticking coefficient of gaseous adsorbates such as carbon dioxide  @xcite , decreasing catalytic efficiency .",
    "figure [ fi:1 ] illustrates the basic steps in the first half of a typical exchange process .",
    "this first half is the desorption of a water molecule from the electrode surface as found in the simulations we detail in the next sections of this paper .",
    "the three panels of the figure are each separated by approximately 1 ps , with a tagged molecule initially adsorbed to the metal , proceeding through its transition state where it leaves behind a surface vacancy , before committing to bulk liquid where the vacancy either diffuses away or becomes annihilated by an adsorption event .",
    "the orientational relaxation of water molecules within the adlayer occurs roughly @xmath0 times more slowly then for those within the bulk liquid , and nearly @xmath1 times more slowly than at the bulk liquid interface .",
    "not surprisingly , a detailed characterization of molecular desorption requires the quantification of local surface reorganization ability .",
    "figure [ fi:1 ] also renders the liquid s instantaneous interface adjacent to the composite electrode - water surface .",
    "this soft - liquid interface is identified as in ref .  .",
    "we see below that it is important in distinguishing the adsorbed and desorbed states with reference to the position of the instantaneous liquid phase boundary . only with this frame of reference",
    "does it become clear that desorption is an instantonic event with few recrossings .",
    "otherwise the nature of the process is obscured by slow capillary - wave - like dynamics of the interface . with the adsorbed and desorbed states or basins for a tagged water molecule",
    "thus defined , we use tools of transition path sampling  @xcite to consider the mechanism of desorption . in particular , we determine a collective reaction coordinate that describes the ensemble of transition states .",
    "finally , we consider the dynamics involved in the time - reverse process , i.e. , the adsorption of a molecule from the bulk onto the electrode . the appendix provides additional results and details on our methodology .",
    "in order for an adsorbed molecule to enter the bulk liquid it must incorporate itself into the established hydrogen bonding environment of the liquid .",
    "such a process is initiated through the scavenging of broken hydrogen bonds that arise spontaneously but fleetingly at a liquid water interface .",
    "this process is thus modulated by spatial fluctuations in the position of the bulk liquid interface that , due to the hydrophobic nature of the extended water - metal interface@xcite , are large and driven by collective displacements of weakly - bound molecules .",
    "consequently if the position of the desorbing molecule is described relative to a static frame of reference , the fluctuations in the soft liquid interface are likely to obscure meaningful details related to the formation of the initial hydrogen bonds between a desorbing molecule and the bulk . in order to account for these fluctuations explicitly ,",

    "similar qualitative features appear in the analogous free energy as a function of absolute position shown in the appendix .    in view of these features , we define the following dynamic indicator functions for a tagged molecule , @xmath11 , belonging to the adsorbed state , @xmath29 , or desorbed state , @xmath30 .",

    "the correlation function is independent of the particle label , @xmath11 , because all the water molecules are indistinguishable at equilibrium .",
    "later , we generalize to nonequilibrium cases where the particle - label index is important .    this correlation function is estimated with straightforward molecular dynamics simulations by harvesting 2000 trajectories bridging adsorbed and desorbed basins ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the short - time behavior of @xmath2 is indicative of transient barrier crossings and recrossings and the longer - time behavior exhibits the linear growth expected for a rate process@xcite .",
    "the time derivative , @xmath36 , reaches its plateau value after a transient time , and this transient time is approximately the mean instanton time , @xmath37 , where a formula for the instanton time of a specific trajectory , @xmath38 , is given below . with the basins as defined above ( eqs .",

    "given the surface density of water on the electrode , one desorption event occurs roughly every 3 ns per nm@xmath42 .",
    "the rate for desorption is independent of the basin definitions , but the typical time to reach the plateau , @xmath37 , is sensitive to these definitions .",
    "this sensitivity arises from the possibility of recrossing events as the molecule lingers near the top of a free energy barrier . as a quantitative measure of the time it takes to cross the barrier , for each single trajectory of duration @xmath43 in which the tagged molecule @xmath11 crosses from adsorbed state to desorbed state",

    "[ fi:2](c ) .",
    "the distribution is roughly exponential , consistent with different desorption events being uncorrelated .",
    "the time constant for the exponential is about 3 ps .",
    "this average value , @xmath37 , is in line with the typical time for a water molecule to diffuse @xmath45 in the homogeneous liquid , which is about 5 ps . on the other hand , a much larger instanton time is found when using definitions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 based upon the separation from the metal surface or mean interface , rather than the separation from the instantaneous interface .",
    "that alternative separation is given by @xmath46 , the component of the vector @xmath10 perpendicular to the plane of the static surfaces .",
    "in that case , replacing @xmath20 with @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "[ eq : ha ] and [ eq : hb ] , we find that the average instanton time increases to 20 ps .",
    "( see appendix b. ) this larger time indicates the increased likelihood for recrossing events along this coordinate .",

    "the variable @xmath20  the separation of a water molecule from the instantaneous interface  serves as a distinguishing order parameter for adsorbed and desorbed states , but it is not sufficient to characterize pathways between adsorbed and desorbed states .",
    "this fact is demonstrated now through analysis of the transition state ensemble ( tse ) .",
    "members of the tse can be harvested from the trajectories used to compute the correlation function , @xmath2 .",
    "these are the configurations from which short trajectories commit to either reactant or product with equal likelihood  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for trajectories that begin at coordinate @xmath47 with randomly chosen velocities and propagate for a time @xmath43 , the commitment probability , @xmath48 , is the fraction of trajectories that end up in the desorbed basin . here ,",
    "the trajectory time is larger than the transient time but not so large to permit multiple transitions , i.e. @xmath49 , and accordingly , the tse is the subset of configurations with @xmath50 . to estimate @xmath48 , we use @xmath51 ps and average over 10 separate realizations of the random velocities taken from the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "if this estimate falls within a 90@xmath52 confidence interval of 0.5 , we say @xmath53 is a member of the tse .",
    "the distribution of these configurations , @xmath54 , is difficult to interpret because @xmath53 is a high - dimensional variable . to make headway , we project onto a low - dimensional representation .",
    "the notation we use for the resulting marginal distributions is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the dynamical variable , and @xmath57 is its observed value .",

    "for the 100 surface , we find that on average the local number of persistent hydrogen bonds made adjacent to a tagged site increases with increasing @xmath87 .",

    "this is a reflection of the stable monolayer surface structure , which is commensurate with the 4-fold coordination of the exposed lattice and water s preferred hydrogen bonding patterns .",
    "defects that disrupt this four - coordinated network allow for increased mobility of the water molecules orientation@xcite , and consequently these sites have a lower reorganization energy .",
    "however , there is not a perfect correlation between persistent hydrogen bonds and reorganization energy , the correlation coefficient is 0.5 .",
    "this low correlation is because the reorganization energy is not a local quantity , and rather can reflect more subtle strains in the hydrogen bonding network that add up over neighboring molecules and allow for facile relaxation .",

    ". these results are consistent with previous work that found faster relaxation times of water molecules adsorbed on the 111 compared to the 100 .",
    "this is due to the six - fold coordination of the lattice with is less commensurate with hydrogen bonding that introduces a larger degree of disorder on the 111 surface and facilities motion .",
