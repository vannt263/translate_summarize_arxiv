    "in this work , we have shown that a hierarchy of modes emerges in systems of interacting fermions in one dimension at high energy controlled by the system length , in marked contrast to the well - known fermionic quasiparticles of a fermi liquid and hydrodynamic modes of a luttinger liquid at low energy .",
    "we have obtained theoretically the dynamic response functions for a model of spinless fermions with short - range interactions using the exact diagonalisation methods of the bethe ansatz for the spectrum and the form factors of the system . analysing the spectral function in detail ,",
    "we have found that the first - level ( strongest ) mode in long systems has a parabolic dispersion , like that of a renormalised free particle .",
    "the second - level excitations produce a singular power - law line shape for the first - level mode and different kinds of power - law behaviour at the spectral edges . evaluating the form factor necessary for the dynamical structure factor",
    "we have shown that it has the same general form as the form factor of the spectral function , manifesting the same hierarchy of modes .",
    "using the same many - body matrix elements obtained microscopically , we have also calculated the local density of states .",
    "it provides a more convenient way to analyse how the hierarchy at high energy changes into the hydrodynamic modes of the luttinger liquid at low energies .",
    "we have shown , via a full bethe - ansatz calculation , that the ldos is suppressed at the fermi energy in a power - law fashion in full accord with the prediction of the tomonaga - luttinger model .",
    "away from the fermi point , where the lorentz invariance of the linear dispersion is reduced to galilean by the parabolicity of the spectrum , the ldos is dominated by the first ( leading ) level of the hierarchy .",
    "we have demonstrated that the transition from one regime to another is a smooth cross - over .",
    "we measure momentum - resolved tunnelling conductance in one - dimensional wires formed in the gaas / algaas double - well heterostructure by an array of finger gates . in this set - up we probe the spectral function of unpolarised electrons ( spinful fermions ) and find a pronounced spin - charge separation at low energy with a ratio of the spin and the charge velocities up to 1.8 , which confirms that our system is in the strongly interacting regime . by varying the gate voltage that controls the width of our 1d wires ,",
    "we demonstrate control of the interaction strength of about @xmath324 ; the deeper confining potential of the wires populates higher 1d subbands as well which in turn screens stronger coulomb interactions in the principal 1d band reducing the interaction strength . in @xmath350m - long wires",
    "we find a clear feature resembling the second - level excitations , which dies away rapidly at high momentum .",
    "a qualitative fit shows that the feature decays in a fashion that is consistent with the power - law prediction in this paper for spinless electrons .",
    "thus we have shown that the hierarchy is apparently a generic phenomenon at least for one- and two - point correlation functions of fermions without spin , and for a transport experiment for fermions with spin .",
