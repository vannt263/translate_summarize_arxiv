    "leptogenesis @xcite is a cosmological application of the see - saw mechanism @xcite , successfully linking two seemingly independent experimental observations : the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe and the neutrino ( masses and mixing ) parameters tested in low energy neutrino experiments .",
    "the matter - antimatter asymmetry can be expressed in terms of the baryon - to - photon number ratio , quite precisely and accurately determined by cmb observations , in particular from planck ( anisotropies plus lensing ) data @xcite _",
    "b^cmb = ( 6.065 0.090 ) 10 ^ -10 . on quantitative grounds , the requirement of successful leptogenesis",
    "is nicely supported by neutrino oscillation experiments measuring the atmospheric and the solar neutrino mass scales within an optimal ( order - of - magnitude ) range @xcite .",
    "if one considers the so called vanilla scenario , where lepton flavour effects are neglected , a hierarchical rh neutrino spectrum is assumed and the asymmetry is dominantly produced by the lightest rh neutrinos , one obtains an upper bound on the neutrino masses @xmath14 @xcite . as a sufficient ( but not necessary ) condition that guarantees the final asymmetry to be independent of the initial conditions ( strong thermal leptogenesis ) , a lower bound @xmath15 on the lightest neutrino mass is also easily obtained .",
    "this neutrino mass window @xcite is quite interesting since in this way one obtains ( at least partially ) a testable quantitative link between the matter - anti matter asymmetry and the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "however , any attempt to derive further connections with the low energy neutrino parameters encounters serious difficulties , mainly for two reasons : the first is that , within the minimal picture , the right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos responsible for the generation of the asymmetry are too heavy to give any observational trace , except for the matter - anti matter asymmetry itself ; the second is that , by just combining the requirement of successful leptogenesis with low energy neutrino data , there is not a model independent way to over - constrain the see - saw parameter space obtaining testable predictions on future low energy neutrino results . in particular ,",
    "the final asymmetry is completely independent of the parameters in the leptonic mixing matrix tested by neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "when lepton flavour effects are taken into account @xcite , the final asymmetry does depend explicitly on the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "this could raise the hope that leptogenesis can be tested with neutrino oscillations experiments .",
    "however , the final asymmetry generally still depends also on the high energy parameters , associated to the properties of the heavy rh neutrinos .",
    "it turns out that the observed value of the asymmetry can be attained for an arbitrary choice of the low energy neutrino parameters . as a consequence , inclusion of flavour effects",
    "does not lead to new model independent predictions or links with the low energy neutrino parameters .",
    "this remains true even within restricted scenarios such as the usual @xmath16-dominated leptogenesis scenario @xcite or the two rh neutrino scenario @xcite .",
    "flavour effects have also an impact on the validity of the above mentioned neutrino mass window and in particular of the lower bound @xmath17 , originating from an intriguing conspiracy between the measured atmospheric and solar neutrino mass scales and the condition of successful strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "this is because , when flavour effects are considered , it is much easier for a pre - existing asymmetry to escape the rh neutrino wash - out @xcite .",
    "a solution to the requirement of successful strong thermal leptogenesis still exists , but the conditions for its realisation become seemingly quite special .",
    "first of all they imply a tauon @xmath18-dominated scenario , where the final asymmetry is produced by the next - to - lightest rh neutrinos in the two flavour regime , implying @xmath19 , dominantly in the tauon flavour and where the lightest rh neutrino mass @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , there are a few further conditions on the flavoured decay parameters that apparently make the whole set very difficult to be realised in realistic models .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of flavour effects makes much more difficult to satisfy the strong thermal condition .    on the other hand , there are some phenomenologically significant implications of flavour effects .",
    "for example , it is interesting that under some conditions on the rh neutrino masses , the same source of @xmath21 violation that could give effects in neutrino oscillations , would also be sufficient to explain the observed matter - anti matter asymmetry within the @xmath16-dominated scenario @xcite .",
    "after the recent discovery of a non - vanishing @xmath22 in long baseline and reactor experiments @xcite and subsequent global analyses @xcite finding [ newrangetheta13 ] 8^ < _ 13 < 10^ ( ~95% c.l . ) , this scenario would be viable if @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "though the realisation of successful dirac phase leptogenesis is not motivated within a precise theoretical framework , this scenario could still emerge as an approximated case within some proposed models such as , for example , minimum flavour violation @xcite and two rh neutrino models @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this respect , it will be rather interesting to determine the value of the dirac phase during the next years .",
    "another important consequence of flavour effects is that the @xmath18-dominated scenario @xcite applies for a much wider region of the parameter space .",
    "this is because the @xmath18 produced asymmetry can more easily escape the lightest rh neutrino ( @xmath16 ) wash - out @xcite and reproduce the observed asymmetry @xcite .",
    "an important application of this effect is that it rescues @xcite the so called @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis scenario @xcite .",
    "this scenario corresponds to a very well theoretically motivated set of ( @xmath0-inspired ) conditions that over - constrains the see - saw parameter space . in this way",
    "the final asymmetry becomes much more sensitive to the low energy neutrino parameters than in the general case . within an unflavoured description ,",
    "the final asymmetry is dominated by the lightest rh neutrino contribution .",
    "however , in the light of the current neutrino oscillations data , the rh neutrino mass spectrum turns out to be typically highly hierarchical with the lightest rh neutrino mass @xmath25 @xcite , well below the lower bound for successful leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "this result is quite stable under a precise definition of the @xmath0-inspired conditions .",
    "it just holds barring very fine tuned choices of the parameters around ` crossing - level ' solutions where rh neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate @xcite , @xmath21 asymmetries get resonantly enhanced @xcite and successful leptogenesis can be attained @xcite .    on the other hand , when flavour effects are taken into account , the asymmetry produced by the @xmath18 decays can reproduce the observed asymmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis is rescued by a thorough account of lepton and heavy neutrino flavour effects and it becomes viable @xcite if some interesting constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters are satisfied @xcite .",
    "in particular , a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass , @xmath15 , holds .",
    "moreover inverted ordered neutrino masses are only marginally allowed .",
    "there is , however , also another interesting feature of @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis @xcite : it is potentially able to satisfy the strong thermal condition , since it indeed naturally realises the above mentioned tauon @xmath18-dominated scenario .    in this paper we investigate in detail this potential feature of @xmath0-inspired models to realise successful strong thermal leptogenesis and we indeed show that there exists a subset of the solutions leading to successful @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis that also satisfies the strong thermal condition .",
    "we show that this novel solution realising strong thermal condition within @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis , implies quite sharp and distinctive constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters , in particular on the neutrino masses .",
    "interestingly , these non - trivially overlap with current experimental constraints and , as we discuss , they can be fully tested by future experiments .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the notation and review the status of low energy neutrino experimental results . in section 3",
    "we briefly review the set up for @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis , verifying the results obtained in @xcite and presenting new improved scatter plots that strengthen the conclusions of @xcite and reveal some new interesting features . in section 4 we briefly review and motivate the conditions for successful strong thermal leptogenesis . in section 5 , the central section of the paper , we combine strong thermal and @xmath0-inspired conditions and show the existence of a solution implying predictive constraints on neutrino parameters , briefly discussing the prospects to test them in next years . in section 6",
    "we discuss different aspects of this new solution such as theoretical uncertainties , stability under variation of the involved parameters , corresponding forms of the orhtogonal and rh neutrino mixing matrices .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we draw the conclusions .",
    "adding three rh neutrinos to the standard model lagrangian , one per each generation as predicted by @xmath0 models , with yukawa coupling @xmath26 and a majorana mass term @xmath27 , a neutrino dirac mass term @xmath28 is generated by the vacuum expectation value @xmath29 of the higgs boson , like for the other massive fermions and in particular for the charged leptons with dirac mass matrix @xmath30 . in this way , in the basis where charged lepton and right - handed neutrino mass matrices are diagonal , their lagrangian mass terms can be written as ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) - l_m = d_m__r + m_di n_i r + 12 d_m n_i r + , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .    in the see - saw limit ,",
    "for @xmath36 , the spectrum of neutrino mass eigenstates splits into a very heavy set , @xmath37 , with masses almost coinciding with the majorana masses @xmath38 , and into a light set @xmath39 , with a symmetric mass matrix @xmath40 given by the see - saw formula [ seesaw ] m _ = - m_d 1d_m m_d^t .",
    "this is diagonalised by a unitary matrix @xmath41 , [ leptonic ] u^ m _",
    "u^ = - d_m , corresponding to the leptonic mixing matrix , in a way that we can write [ diagonalseesaw ] d_m = u^ m_d 1d_m m_d^t u^ .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments measure two light neutrino mass squared differences , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "there are two possibilities : either light neutrino masses are normally ordered ( no ) , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , or they are inversely ordered ( io ) , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . for no ( io )",
    "it is found , for example in @xcite and similarly in @xcite , and on @xmath48 since , with very good approximation , all the constraints that we will discuss are insensitive to them . ] [ solatmscales ] m_atm = 0.0505(0.0493)ev m_sol = 0.0087ev . in this way",
    "there is just one parameter left to be measured in order to determine the so called absolute neutrino mass scale fixing the three light neutrino masses .",
    "this can be conveniently identified with the lightest neutrino mass @xmath49 .",
    "the most stringent upper bound on @xmath49 is derived from cosmological observations .",
    "a conservative upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses has been recently placed by the planck collaboration @xcite . combining planck and high-@xmath50 cmb anisotropies , wmap polarisation and baryon acoustic oscillation data it",
    "is found @xmath51 .",
    "when neutrino oscillation results are combined , this translates into an upper bound on the lightest neutrino mass , [ upperboundm1 ] m_1 0.07 ev , showing how cosmological observations start to corner quasi - degenerate neutrinos .    in the no case we adopt for the leptonic mixing matrix the pdg parametrisation @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "because of the adopted light neutrino mass labelling convention , in the io case the leptonic mixing matrix has to be recast simply with a proper relabelling of the column index , explicitly u^(io ) = (    ccc s_13e^-i & c_12c_13 & s_12c_13 + s_23c_13 & -s_12c_23-c_12s_23s_13e^i & c_12c_23-s_12s_23s_13e^i + c_23c_13 & s_12s_23-c_12c_23s_13e^i & -c_12s_23-s_12c_23s_13e^i    ) ( e^i , e^i , 1 )",
    ". as already discussed , the reactor mixing angle is found in the range eq .",
    "( [ newrangetheta13 ] ) .",
    "current global analyses @xcite find for the solar mixing angle the @xmath55 range @xmath56 .    the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath57 , is now favoured by minos results to be non - maximal @xcite .",
    "this is also confirmed by global analyses @xcite , though with different statistical significance . in @xcite @xmath57 is favoured to be in the first octant , finding for no the @xmath55 range @xmath58 . in @xcite @xmath57",
    "is also favoured in the first octant for no but with a very low statistical significance . in @xcite the ( almost octant symmetric )",
    "@xmath55 range @xmath59 is found for no .",
    "certainly more data are needed for a robust determination of the octant .",
    "as we will see in section 5 , our solution will give quite a clear prediction on this point .",
    "it will also prove useful to introduce the so called orthogonal ( or casas - ibarra ) parametrisation @xcite . the see - saw formula eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) can be recast as an orthogonality condition for a matrix @xmath60 . through @xmath61",
    "the neutrino dirac mass matrix can be expressed as [ orthogonal ] m_d = u .",
    "the @xmath61 matrix contains 6 independent high energy parameters encoding the properties of the 3 rh neutrinos ( e.g. the 3 lifetimes and the 3 total @xmath62 asymmetries ) and it is quite useful not only to express the different relevant quantities for the calculation of the asymmetry , and for this reason we will employ it as an intermediate step for the calculation of the asymmetry , but also to characterise see - saw neutrino models .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , without imposing any condition on the nine high energy parameters , the baryon asymmetry has in general to be calculated taking into account both lepton and heavy neutrino flavour effects and the calculation should proceed through the solution of a set of density matrix equations @xcite .",
    "the condition of successful leptogenesis , @xmath63 , places an upper bound on the neutrino masses , @xmath64 @xcite , holding in the case of @xmath16-dominated leptogenesis and in the one - flavour regime , for @xmath65 .",
    "this is the only existing model independent link between leptogenesis and low energy neutrino data .",
    "now let us see how , by imposing @xmath0-inspired conditions and barring fine - tuned crossing level solutions @xcite , a rh neutrino mass pattern implying a @xmath18-dominated leptogenesis scenario necessarily emerges , where the calculation of the asymmetry reduces to a simple analytical expression and the successful leptogenesis bound implies constraints on all low energy neutrino parameters @xcite .",
    "the neutrino dirac mass matrix can be diagonalised by a bi - unitary transformation [ biunitary ] m_d = v^_l d_m_d u_r , where @xmath66 . the unitary matrix @xmath67 acts on the left - handed neutrino fields operating the transformation from the weak basis to the yukawa basis .",
    "it is the analogous of the ckm matrix in the quark sector , operating the transformation from the down to the up quark mass basis .    inserting the bi - unitary parameterisation for @xmath68 into the diagonalised see - saw formula eq .",
    "( [ diagonalseesaw ] ) , one can see that @xmath69 diagonalises the matrix m^-1 d_m_d^-1v_lud_mu^tv_l^td_m_d^-1 , explicitly @xmath70 . , showing that @xmath69 operates the transformation of the majorana mass matrix from the yukawa basis , where @xmath68 is diagonal , to the basis where the majorana mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "] this expression shows that the rh neutrino mass spectrum , and the matrix @xmath69 , can be expressed in terms of the low energy neutrino parameters , of the three eigenvalues of @xmath68 and of the six parameters in @xmath67 , explicitly @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where the three @xmath73 are the ratios of the dirac mass matrix eigenvalues to the three up quark masses , explicitly m_d1 = _ 1 m_u , m_d2 = _ 2 m_c , m_d3 = _ 3 m_t .",
    "notice that so far we have not yet restricted the see - saw parameters space , we have just simply introduced a sort of hybrid parameterisation where , compared to the orthogonal parameterisation ( cf .",
    "( [ orthogonal ] ) ) , the nine parameters @xmath74 are replaced by @xmath75 or compared to the bi - unitary parameterisation the nine high energy parameters @xmath76 are replaced by @xmath77 , i.e. by the nine testable low energy neutrino parameters in @xmath40 .",
    "we now define @xmath0-inspired models those respecting the following set of three ( working ) assumptions :    * the matrix @xmath67 is restricted within the range @xmath78 , i.e. the three mixing angles in @xmath67 are not larger than the corresponding three mixing angles in the ckm matrix .",
    "this is the most important ( i.e. restrictive ) condition .",
    "* we assume @xmath79 . *",
    "we bar regions in the space of parameters around crossing level solutions , where at least two rh neutrino masses are non - hierarchical , more specifically we impose @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the last condition , of a hierarchical rh neutrino spectrum , is not restrictive at all .",
    "this is because the conditions to realise crossing level solutions for the rh neutrino mass spectra are very fine tuned @xcite , especially when the successful leptogenesis bound is imposed .",
    "the reason is simple : at the level crossings , the @xmath62 asymmetries are resonantly enhanced and span many orders of magnitude .",
    "consequently , the baryon asymmetry is very sensitive to tiny variations of the parameters that have to be highly fine tuned in order for the successful leptogenesis condition , @xmath82 , to be satisfied ( as an example of a scenario realising a crossing level solution see @xcite ) .    under these conditions , and",
    "given the current low energy neutrino data , the rh neutrino mass spectrum is hierarchical and of the form @xcite m_1 : m_2 : m_3 = ( _ 1m_u)^2 : ( _ 2m_c)^2 : ( _ 3m_t)^2 . in particular , from the second working assumption and given the current low energy neutrino data , it follows that @xmath83gev while @xmath84gev .",
    "it also follows that all the heaviest rh neutrino ( @xmath85 ) @xmath62 asymmetries are strongly suppressed . in this way the only contribution able to explain the observed asymmetry is that one from next - to - lightest rh neutrino ( @xmath18 ) decays .",
    "therefore , the only possibility to satisfy the successful leptogenesis bound is within a @xmath18-dominated scenario . assuming a thermal scenario , this",
    "necessarily requires that the reheating temperature @xmath86 .",

    "first of all we confirm the existence of a lower bound @xmath156 .",
    "this can be considered quite a conservative and robust lower bound from @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis .",
    "the origin of this lower bound is due to the fact that for @xmath157 one has @xmath158gev and consequently all the @xmath18 @xmath62 asymmetries get suppressed @xcite .",
    "a new feature , that is interesting to notice in the light of the @xmath22 measurement , opening prospects for a measurement of the dirac phase @xmath159 , is that the lower bound on @xmath49 depends on @xmath159 and in particular the lowest value , @xmath160ev , is saturated for @xmath161 , while for @xmath162 , as very weakly supported by current global analyses , one has @xmath163ev .",
    "therefore , in these models , a determination of @xmath159 shows an interesting interplay with absolute neutrino mass scale experiments .",
    "another interesting constraint of this scenario , found in @xcite and confirmed by our analysis , is the existence of an upper bound on @xmath57 for sufficiently large values of @xmath49 , the @xmath144 type region .",
    "our new results confirm this constraint as well .",
    "this is now determined quite accurately and precisely : @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "it should be noticed that the new upper bound from planck data ( cf .",
    "( [ upperboundm1 ] ) ) now basically almost completely rules out this @xmath144 type region at high @xmath49 values .      as it can be seen in the lower central panel of fig .  1",
    ", the majorana phases can not have arbitrary values but there are some quite large excluded regions . our results for @xmath141 are fully compatible with the results found in @xcite . in @xcite results",
    "were found for @xmath166 and showed that the majorana phases tend to cluster dominantly around disconnected regions for values @xmath167 and @xmath168 and sub - dominantly around regions for @xmath169 .",
    "now , since we have found a much greater amount of solutions , the regions are sharply determined and for @xmath170 the allowed regions are connected .",
    "however , the bulk of points still falls around the same values found in @xcite .",
    "the differences are then just simply to be ascribed to the much higher number of determined points .      the results for the dirac phase and for the jarlskog invariant , j_cp = im[u_3u_e 2u^_2u^_e 3 ] = c_12s_12c_23c^2_13s_13 , do not show any constraint and , in particular , no preference for the sign . compared to the results found in @xcite we have just found a trivial bug in the plot of @xmath171 vs. @xmath22 shown in @xcite where @xmath22 was displayed for @xmath172 in radians instead of degrees as indicated .",
    "a particularly interesting test was performed in @xcite .",
    "the allowed regions for the low energy neutrino parameters were also determined without imposing any restriction from low energy neutrino experiments . in this way",
    "one can test how predictive the scenario is and whether the agreement with current experimental data is particularly significant .",
    "we have repeated this test and the results are shown in fig .",
    "+    also in this case we confirm the results of @xcite .",
    "the huge amount of points now clearly determines the existence of excluded regions .",
    "the fact that the experimental results ( the green bands ) fall in the allowed regions represents a positive test of the model .",
    "in particular , it is quite interesting to notice ( see yellow points in the left bottom panel ) that the measured value of @xmath22 implies that the atmospheric mixing angle range @xmath173 is excluded or that for the measured values of @xmath57 the range of values @xmath174 is excluded .",
    "however , the allowed ( yellow ) regions cover a large portion of the parameter space and , therefore , the test is not particularly statistically significant . in other words ,",
    "neutrino data could have already ruled out @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis , but the probability that they just by chance fall within the @xmath0 allowed regions is too high to draw any statistically significant conclusion . indeed ,",
    "if one looks at the mixing angles , one could say that there was roughly just a @xmath175 probability that the data could exclude @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis . as we will see",
    ", the situation drastically changes when the strong thermal leptogenesis condition is further imposed .",
    "we have so far assumed that the observed asymmetry is entirely generated by leptogenesis",
    ". however , there are other possible external mechanisms , such as gravitational baryogenesis @xcite and affleck - dine baryogenesis @xcite , able to generate an asymmetry prior the onset of leptogenesis . in particular , so called grand unified baryogenesis models @xcite , are particularly relevant within our context , since this would be quite a natural and extensively studied possibility arising just within grand unified @xmath0 models inspiring the scenario we are discussing .",
    "moreover they are particularly well motivated considering the large initial temperatures required by minimal thermal leptogenesis ( though a non - thermal production would be also plausible )",
    ".    these potential sources would compete with leptogenesis and in general , at the large initial reheat temperature required by ( minimal ) thermal leptogenesis and in particular by @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis , @xmath176 , they would typically produce a pre - existing asymmetry well above the observed one , up to values @xmath1 .",
    "clearly one possibility would be to assume that at the end of the inflationary stage any asymmetry was completely erased and that no mechanism had efficiently produced a pre - existing asymmetry prior the onset of leptogenesis .",
    "however , it would be quite attractive , and the constraints on low energy neutrino parameters much more significant , if the same processes involving rh neutrinos could wash - out any pre - existing asymmetry and at the same time produce a final value of the asymmetry independent of the initial rh neutrino abundances ( strong thermal leptogenesis condition ) .",
    "this would be an analogous situation compared to what happens in standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",

    "considering the relation eq .",
    "( [ etanbml ] ) between @xmath183 and @xmath110 , it is , therefore , simply sufficient to impose @xmath184 to enforce the strong thermal leptogenesis condition .    when flavour effects are taken into account , and considering hierarchical rh neutrino mass patterns , as we are considering within @xmath0-inspired models , strong thermal leptogenesis can be realised only within a tauon - dominated @xmath18-dominated scenario where the dominant contribution to the asymmetry is in the tauon flavour @xcite .",
    "this is because , if @xmath120gev , the tauon components of the lepton and anti - lepton quantum states can be measured before the asymmetry is produced by the @xmath18-decays . in this way",

    "as we have seen , the tauon dominance condition is naturally satisfied by two of the three types of solutions found in @xmath0-inspired leptogenesis.gev , the reason why one needs a tauon @xmath18-dominated scenario to satisfy the strong thermal condition , reflects typically into a dominant tauon @xmath62 asymmetry ( @xmath186 ) and , therefore , naturally into a tauon @xmath18-dominated scenario within @xmath0-inspired models . ] this , therefore , represents quite a well motivated theoretical framework that is a potential candidate to realise successful strong thermal leptogenesis .",
    "the request of the successful strong thermal condition , however , goes beyond the tauon dominance since it also requires quite restrictive additional conditions onto the flavoured decay parameters .",
    "these additional conditions can be fully understood calculating explicitly the residual value of the pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "first of all , we can safely assume that the heaviest rh neutrinos are too heavy to be thermally produced and , therefore , they do not contribute to the wash - out of the pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "this is clearly a conservative assumption since the presence of the heaviest rh neutrino can only introduce an additional wash - out stage of the pre - existing asymmetry .",
    "however , it should be taken into account that , since @xmath187gev the @xmath85 wash - out acts on a @xmath188 flavour direction and , therefore , it is in general not really helpful in washing out the pre - existing asymmetry , not even along the @xmath105 direction @xcite . for this reason an inclusion of such a wash - out would not have in any case any impact on the constraints we will find .",
    "therefore , if a pre - existing asymmetry is generated at @xmath189 by some external mechanism , at a later stage , for temperatures @xmath190 , this simply remains constant , n^p_b - l(t m_2 ) = n_b - l^p , i . for temperatures",
    "@xmath191 , because of the the fast tauon lepton interactions , the quantum lepton states become an incoherent admixture of a tauon component and of a @xmath105 orthogonal component @xmath104 .",
    "the initial pre - existing asymmetry can then be regarded as the sum of two components n^p_b - l = n__^p ,",

    ", there could be differences in the pre - existing lepton - antilepton flavour compositions and these would translate into additional opposite contributions to the flavoured asymmetries , the so called phantom terms , that , however we can simply neglect in order to simplify the notation .",

    "the expression eq .",
    "( [ finalpas ] ) now explicitly shows that , in order for successful strong thermal leptogenesis to be realised , the final asymmetry has to be necessarily tauon dominated .",

    "table 2 ) is certainly the most challenging constraint to be tested . in the bottom right panel of fig .  1 we have also over - imposed the general allowed regions in the plane @xmath138 vs. @xmath49 from current experiments , both for no and for io . as one can see",
    ", the allowed region corresponding to the solution falls into a range of @xmath138 that is also corresponding to the values expected for inverted hierarchy .",
    "these values are not accessible to current ongoing experiments , nor even to planned experiments such as supernemo , next , lucifer , mjd that will at most able to exclude values of @xmath138 above @xmath263mev ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a great international effort for the study of new experiments able to test values in the range 1020 mev , since these would exclude inverted hierarchy .",
    "again , it is then important that the mass ordering can independently be determined by neutrino oscillation experiments able to distinguish our no semi - hierarchical solution from inverted hierarchy .",
    "if both @xmath49 and @xmath138 will be measured with sufficient precision , a comparison will provide an additional test of our solution that predicts @xmath264 , due to the particular values of the majorana phases . in the expression for @xmath138 . ] in the bottom right panel of fig .  1",
    ", the region between the black lines is the allowed region from low energy neutrino experiments ( no leptogenesis ) for no ( lower region ) and io ( higher region ) . for no the ratio @xmath265",
    "can , in general , be in the range @xmath266 ( corresponding analytically to @xmath267 @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a result @xmath268mev , would further very strongly support the solution .",
    "notice that a determination of both @xmath49 and @xmath138 would still not be able to fully determine the two majorana phases .",
    "this would provide ideally an even stronger test of the solution making quite precise predictions on both .",
    "however , even if we still miss a way to fully determine the majorana phases , in case of a multiple agreement of all low energy neutrino experiments with the presented constraints , the probability that this is just accidental would be really low ( as discussed @xmath269 if one considers both regions together , or even just @xmath247 if one only considers the discussed solution compatible with current neutrino oscillation data ) , quite an interesting feature of the solution prospectively .",
    "in this section we discuss some important aspects of the solution .",
    "we have so far focused on the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters that can be tested in experiments .",
    "however , the solution is also determined by the 6 parameters in the matrix @xmath67 . indeed",
    "the first of the working assumption defining @xmath0-inspired models , @xmath270 does not completely fix @xmath67 but allows some variation within a restricted range . in fig .",
    "7 we show the constraints on the six parameters in the @xmath67 .",
    "as one can see from the central panel , the points distribute quite uniformly for @xmath271 and @xmath272 , those strongly restricted by the @xmath0-inspired condition , while there is a slight preference for high values of @xmath273 , maybe an indication for a slight preference of @xmath274 compared to @xmath275 , though solutions for @xmath275 are anyway possible .",
    "the points also seem to distribute uniformly in @xmath276 that , therefore , is not constrained even when the strong thermal condition is added . on the other hand , as it can be seen in the right panel of fig .  7 , the solution favours values of the majorana - like phases in a region around @xmath277 .      in this subsection we show in fig .  8 the same plots shown in fig .  2 in the case of a benchmark point in the space of parameters that does respect the strong thermal leptogensis .",
    "this has been simply chosen as a point that is located in a central position within the ` red ' allowed regions ( @xmath278 ) .",
    "the results are quite interesting because they show directly how , for @xmath279 and @xmath280 , the @xmath281 are indeed able to fulfil all the conditions eq .",
    "( [ strongthconditions ] ) .",
    "+    this benchmark point shows how the strong thermal @xmath0-inspired solution is a proper combination of the type @xmath142 and @xmath143 solutions discussed in 3.2.1 and shown in fig .  2 for a specific set of values of the parameters .",
    "as for the type @xmath142 solution , there is a sharp dip for @xmath282 around a particular value of @xmath49 such that @xmath283 and in coincidence @xmath284 .",
    "however , while for the type @xmath142 solution one could not respect the condition @xmath153 at the dip , now one can see that this is realised as in type @xmath143 , so that now one has simultaneously @xmath153 and @xmath285 .",
    "another important hybrid feature is that now , as for type @xmath143 , one has @xmath286 instead of @xmath287 as for the type @xmath142 .",
    "this minimises the wash - out of the asymmetry produced by @xmath18 decays still allowing a wash - out of the pre - existing tauon asymmetry and makes possible to fulfil jointly successful leptogenesis and strong thermal condition .",
    "these are the main features of the solution that can be realised , in particular , only if @xmath288mev and @xmath280 . notice that a value @xmath289 represents basically the maximum value of the pre - existing asymmetry that can be washed - out respecting simultaneously the successful leptogenesis bound .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath290 has to be necessarily much larger than @xmath291 and this necessarily introduces a wash - out at the production . for values",
    "@xmath292 the value of @xmath230 for the wash - out of the pre - existing asymmetry becomes so large that the asymmetry produced by @xmath18 decays is too strongly washed - out to reproduce the observed asymmetry .",
    "the solution has been determined fixing some parameters and it is then important to discuss whether a variation of these parameters can significantly change the constraints .",
    "we have already shown and discussed the dependence on the initial value of the pre - existing asymmetry @xmath210 .    the plots in fig .",
    "1 have been obtained for @xmath293 .",
    "we verified that indeed there is no dependence of the constraints on @xmath111 and @xmath112 as discussed .",
    "a value @xmath141 should be considered close to the maximum within @xmath0-inspired models .",
    "we have also determined which would be the minimum value of @xmath294 for the existence of a solution satisfying the strong thermal condition , finding @xmath295 for @xmath296 .",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of the solution to the maximum values of the angles @xmath297 in @xmath67 allowed by the @xmath0-inspired conditions .",
    "we have tripled the values of @xmath272 and @xmath271 finding that the only constraint that changes significantly is the upper bound on @xmath57 that is relaxed to @xmath298 for @xmath296 .",
    "we did not try to modify the cabibbo - like angle @xmath273 since this is already significantly large .",
    "the solution corresponds to a rh neutrino mass spectrum that is genuinely hierarchical since @xmath299 while @xmath300 for @xmath301 .",
    "for example , we have relaxed the condition @xmath133 imposed in the results of fig .  1 , redetermining separately the constraints for @xmath302 finding no new solutions for successful strong thermal leptogenesis . on the asymmetry produced by the @xmath18",
    "is neglected .",
    "this would start to produce some effect only for @xmath303 @xcite .",
    "] we have found a new different marginal solution only at @xmath304ev , incompatible with the cosmological bounds .",
    "this means that our analysis does not exclude the existence of solutions with quasi - degenerate rh neutrino masses .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the strong thermal condition that we have imposed on the relic value of the pre - existing asymmetry ( cf .",
    "( eq .  [ finalpas ] ) ) is valid only in the hierarchical case .",
    "an analysis of the wash - out of a pre - existing asymmetry for quasi - degenerate rh neutrino masses is still missing . in any case",
    "it is important to notice that these possible new solutions would in case correspond to different constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters and would be , therefore , experimentally distinguishable from our solution .",
    "let us now briefly comment on the approximations that we made in the calculation of the asymmetry and on the kind of corrections one could expect removing them .",
    "we are not solving density matrix equations .",
    "when we do not impose the strong thermal condition ( the yellow points ) , these can be important when @xmath305 falls around @xmath306 .",
    "for @xmath305 above @xmath307gev we have calculated the asymmetry at the production in the unflavoured case ( cf .",
    "( [ onefl ] ) ) . around @xmath308gev",
    "there is , therefore , a discontinuity .",
    "however , since flavour effects , for @xmath214gev , tend to enhance the asymmetry reducing the wash - out , most of the solutions lie below @xmath307 gev .",
    "when we impose the strong thermal condition for non - vanishing @xmath210 , we have simply excluded points for @xmath309gev , since the strong thermal condition can be satisfied only if the @xmath18 wash - out occurs in the two - flavour regime .",
    "this is the reason why the allowed regions satisfying the strong thermal conditions sharply cut above @xmath310 .",
    "a calculation from a solution of the density matrix equation would then just simply smoothly describe the transition but this would not significantly affect the results found on the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters since the bulk of points are found for @xmath311 gev .",
    "we are neglecting phantom terms @xcite .",
    "these can affect the @xmath0-inspired solutions ( the yellow points ) but not certainly the strong thermal @xmath0-inspired solution since phantom terms can only be present in the electron and muon asymmetries that are fully washed - out , while the final asymmetry is strictly tauon dominated .",
    "we are neglecting the running of neutrino parameters from the high energy scales to low energies .",
    "however , since our solution is semi - hierarchical and no , the running is negligible for all practical purposes @xcite . for the atmospheric mixing angle ,",
    "the only parameter for which it could be potentially relevant to calculate the running , since we have found compatibility only with the lowest allowed experimental values , the running is at most about @xmath312 from @xmath313gev to low energies , a variation that clearly is completely negligible for any practical purpose .",
    "a potential important correction is flavour coupling @xcite .",
    "this can have two effects : it can alter the asymmetry at the production , usually this goes in the direction of increasing the asymmetry , and it could make the conditions for strong thermal leptogenesis tighter .",
    "the two effects would tend even to cancel with each other .",
    "notice , however , that the flavour coupling would disappear in the limit @xmath314 , since this would correspond to a case where the tauon flavour decouples . however , this is exactly the case realised in the solution and , therefore , again , we do not expect great effects from flavour coupling at the lightest rh neutrino wash - out .",
    "the only effect might be a small enhancement of the asymmetry at the production that could slightly relax the constraints .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle upper bound is the most sensitive constraint to corrections and , therefore , this might motivate an account of flavour coupling .",
    "an account of momentum dependence also does not produce significant corrections since this can alter the lightest rh neutrino wash - out only for @xmath315 @xcite , while in our case the production occurs in the tauon flavour and @xmath145 .",
    "in conclusion we can not envisage sources of significant corrections , though an account of flavour coupling might be justified by a precise determination of the upper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle in connections with future experimental results .",
    "it is also interesting to discuss the form of the rh neutrino mixing matrix @xmath69 and of the orthogonal matrix @xmath61 corresponding to the solution . for the set of values of the parameters corresponding to the benchmark point discussed in 6.2 , in particular @xmath316 , and for @xmath317mev , the resulting rh neutrino mixing matrix @xmath69 is given by u_r (    ccc e^-i0.8 & 510 ^ -4 e^i0.6 & 8 10 ^ -6 + 510 ^ -4 e^i0.6 & e^-i & 2 10 ^ -2 e^i0.3 + 1.5 10 ^ -6 e^-i0.2 & 210 ^ -2 e^-i0.2 & e^i0.15    ) .",
    "contrarily to the final asymmetry and to the @xmath89 , the @xmath69 depends not only on @xmath294 but also on @xmath111 and @xmath112 in a way that off - diagonal terms tend to be damped for a higher hierarchy . for example",
    "if we choose @xmath318 , so that @xmath319 increases while @xmath320 decreases , we obtain u_r (    ccc e^-i0.8 & 310 ^ -3 e^i0.6 & 8 10 ^ -6 + 310 ^ -3 e^i0.6 & e^-i & 3 10 ^ -3 e^i0.3 + 1.5 10 ^ -6 e^-i0.2 & 3 10 ^ -3 e^-i0.2 & e^i0.15    ) , showing that the @xmath321 off - diagonal entries decreased while the @xmath322 increased and the @xmath323 stayed constant . a more drastic enhancement of the , for example",
    ", @xmath321 off - diagonal terms is obtained lowering @xmath112 to @xmath324 obtaining ( @xmath325 , @xmath326 ) u_r (    ccc e^-i0.8 & 510 ^ -4 e^-i0.4 & 1.5 10 ^ -4 e^-i0.1 + 510 ^ -4 e^i0.6 & 0.95 & 0.3 e^i0.3 + 3 10 ^ -5 e^-i0.2 & 0.3 e^i0.9 & 0.95 e^i0.15    ) .",
    "these three examples show how there is a flexibility in the choice of @xmath111 and @xmath112 that can potentially be useful in order to minimise the fine tuning to obtain a softly semi - hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum ( @xmath327 , @xmath328 ) from highly hierarchical neutrino yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the orthogonal matrix @xmath61 is very slightly dependent on @xmath329 .",
    "this can be calculated from @xcite = d_m^-12 u^ v_l^ d_m_d u_r d_m^-12 . for the benchmark choice of parameters one finds [ orthogonal ] (    ccc 0.8 e^-i0.9 & 0.7 e^i 0.1 & 0.4 e^- i 0.7 + 0.7 e^i0.9 & 0.7 e^-i0.7 & 0.8 + 0.4 e^- i0.2 & 0.7 & 0.7 e^ i 0.1    ) .",
    "the very slight dependence of the orthogonal matrix on @xmath330 and @xmath112 is consistent with the independence of the @xmath89 of @xmath111 and @xmath112 and , consequently , combined with the independence of @xmath331 of @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xcite , of the the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters we obtained as well .",
    "this kind of orthogonal matrix ( cf .",
    "( [ orthogonal ] ) ) shows that there are no fine - tuned cancellations in the see - saw formula .",
    "however , each light neutrino mass @xmath8 receives contribution from all three terms @xmath332 , not just from one as in the case of an orthogonal matrix close to the identity or to one of the other five forms obtained from the identity permuting rows and columns @xcite , so called form dominance models @xcite .",
    "we comment on two aspects that will be discussed in detail in future works @xcite .",
    "first , analytic insight into the results obtained from the scatter plots would be certainly desirable requiring a dedicated analysis .",
    "second , our analysis does not specify the confidence level of the constraints on the different low energy neutrino parameters .",
    "this requires a full determination of the probability distribution functions for the different parameters .",
    "this will also be discussed in a future work .",
    "here we just want to notice that these distribution functions are highly non - trivial to determine since even though one starts , as input , from simple gaussian experimental ranges , the complicated dependence of the asymmetry on the parameters makes in a way that the successful leptogenesis bound and the strong thermal condition produce , as output , quite complicated distributions functions to be determined with a statistical procedure . for example",
    "the difference in the upper bounds on @xmath57 in fig .  1 and in fig .",
    "4 is an indication of a different c.l .",
    ", since they are determined with two data sets with a substantial different number of points .",
    "consider the case of an initial pre - existing abundance @xmath296 .",
    "in the first case a number of about two thousands red points was obtained to saturate the bound @xmath280 , given that the initial ranges for the uniform scan on the low energy neutrino parameters are fixed . the c.l . on this",
    "bound corresponds roughly to @xmath333 . in the second case",
    "the number of red points is much lower , about three hundreds and the upper bound , @xmath334 , does not saturate the maximum value . the c.l . in this case corresponds roughly to @xmath335 .",
    "this implies that a future experimental result @xmath336 would strongly disfavour the solution .",
    "a precise determination of @xmath57 will be , therefore , a crucial test for the solution .",
    "we presented a novel solution to the problem of the initial conditions in leptogenesis within @xmath0-inspired models .",
    "it is particularly interesting that this yields definite constraints on all low energy neutrino parameters , sharp enough to have , all together , quite a strong predictive power .",
    "it is encouraging that the solution requires a non - vanishing value of the reactor mixing angle in agreement with the measured range .",
    "this should be considered in addition to the well known leptogenesis conspiracy for which the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass scales are just about ten times higher than the equilibrium neutrino mass @xmath337 , in a way that the decay parameters tend to be @xmath338 , a key feature for the realisation of the strong thermal condition in the flavoured @xmath18-dominated scenario . however , the full set of constraints on neutrino parameters from the strong thermal @xmath0-inspired solution is still far to be fully tested .",
    "as we discussed , it is distinctive enough that it can be regarded as a signature of the solution , hard to be mimicked or to agree just accidentally with the experimental data .",
    "it clearly predicts no neutrino masses , atmospheric mixing angle well in the first octant and it strongly favours a negative dirac phase , around @xmath339 .",
    "indeed these features should all be tested during next years by neutrino oscillation experiments . at the same time",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale predictions , @xmath340 , also provide quite a definite feature that should be tested with cosmological observations and ( ultimately with ) @xmath262 decay experiments",
    ". it will be exciting to see whether future experimental data will further support the presented solution or rule it out .",
    "in any case this provides an example of a motivated falsifiable minimal high energy scale leptogenesis scenario .",
