    "with several active regions and a total mass of more than @xmath2 m@xmath3 , sagittarius b2 ( hereafter sgrb2 ) is one of the most complex and massive sites of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "it is located close to the galactic center and harbors two hot dense cores ( m and n ) , which fragment into several sub cores .",
    "sgrb2(n ) has a very rich chemistry and was called the large molecule heimat ( lmh ) by @xcite .",
    "many complex molecules were discovered there like , e.g. , acetic acid ( ch@xmath4cooh , * ? ? ? * ) , glycolaldehyde ( ch@xmath5(oh)cho , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and acetamide ( ch@xmath4conh@xmath5 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore a prime target to look for new complex molecules .",
    "line surveys at ( sub)mm wavelengths are needed to search for large complex molecules since these molecules emit hundreds of ( weak ) lines .",
    "regions with rich chemistry produce very crowded spectra with many blended lines and the confusion limit is easily reached . in this context , the secure identification of a new molecule requires the identification of many lines and no single line predicted by a temperature and column density derived from multiple lines should be missing ( see , e.g. , the rebuttal of glycine by * ? ? ?",
    "since the spectra are complex , modeling the emission of all known molecules is necessary to prevent mis - assignments and point out blended lines before claiming the detection of a new molecule .    to search for new complex molecules",
    ", we carried out a complete line survey at 3  mm toward the two hot cores sgrb2(n ) and sgrb2(m ) and we present here some preliminary results .",
    "we carried out a complete line survey of sgrb2(n ) and sgrb2(m ) between 80 and 116 ghz with the iram 30 m telescope in 2004 and 2005 , as well as partial surveys at 2  mm and 1.3  mm .",
    "we obtained an rms sensitivity of 15 - 30 mk at 3  mm in @xmath6 scale and reached the confusion limit at 1.3  mm .",
    "the full 3  mm spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : survey ] , as well as a closer view on two small frequency ranges .",
    "the average line density above 3@xmath0 is about 100 and 25 features per ghz , translating into about 3700 and 950 lines over the whole 80 - 116 ghz band , for sgrb2(n ) and sgrb2(m ) , respectively .",
    "some lines are seen in absorption with numerous velocity components and are produced by the diffuse spiral arm clouds lying along the line of sight ( hieret et al .",
    ", _ in prep .",
    "we model the emission of all known molecules , including vibrationally and torsionally excited states , and their isotopologues .",
    "we use the xclass software ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* , and references therein ) to model the emission and absorption lines in the lte approximation .",
    "these calculations take into account beam dilution , lines opacity , and blending .",
    "the molecular spectroscopic parameters are taken from our line catalog which mainly contains all entries from the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from the molecular spectroscopic database of the jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl , see * ? ? ?",
    "each molecule is modeled separately .",
    "the whole spectrum including all the identified molecules is then computed at once ( see the example in fig .  [",
    "f : model ] ) , and the parameters for each molecule are adjusted again when necessary . the quality of the fit is checked by eye over the whole frequency coverage of the line survey .    the detailed results of this modeling will be published in a forthcoming article ( belloche et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ ) .",
    "so far , we have identified 51 molecules , 60 isotopologues , and 41 vibrationally / torsionally excited states in sgrb2(n ) , which represent about 60@xmath1 of the lines detected above 3@xmath0 . in sgrb2(m ) , the corresponding numbers are 41 , 50 , 20 , and 50@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we detected very few deuterated species , and only simple ones .",
    "currently , there are still 40@xmath750@xmath1 lines unidentified in our survey of sgrb2(n ) and sgrb2(m ) , respectively , and 15@xmath77@xmath1 are even stronger than 0.3 k ( i.e. @xmath8 times our noise level ) .",
    "although most of these unidentified lines are most likely emitted by vibrationally or torsionally excited states of already known molecules missing in our database ( e.g. ethanol c@xmath5h@xmath9oh @xmath10=1 , vinyl cyanide c@xmath5h@xmath4cn @xmath11 , ethyl cyanide c@xmath5h@xmath9cn v=2 ) , there is room for detection of new complex molecules . in particular",
    ", we have strong evidence that we detected the molecule aminoacetonitrile  a likely precursor of the simplest amino acid , glycine  in our 30 m survey .",
    "this detection is supported by follow - up observations we carried out with the plateau de bure interferometer and the australia telescope compact array in 2006 ( belloche et al .",
    ", _ to be submitted _ ) . this would be a step forward in the long standing search for amino acids .",
