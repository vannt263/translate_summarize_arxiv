    "although they are often detected as non - thermal x - ray sources , evolved pwne can indeed lead to a bright @xmath2-ray source without any counterpart @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the key issue is that the low - energy synchrotron emission , depends on the internal pwn magnetic field @xcite which may vary as a function of time , following @xmath3 if @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the synchrotron emitting lifetime of tev @xmath2-ray emitting leptons with energy e and @xmath6 is the power - law index of the decay of the average nebular field strength , whereas the vhe emission depends on the background radiation fields , which are constant on time - scales relevant for pwn evolution .",
    "mhd simulations of composite snrs @xcite find that @xmath7 until the passage of the reverse shock ( rs ) ; after the field decay should continue for much longer time since expansion continues . from hydrodynamic simulations , an expression for the time of the rs passage has been given @xcite as @xmath8 , where the @xmath9 term is the density of the ism , the @xmath10 the ejecta mass during the sn explosion and the @xmath11 the sn blast wave energy .",
    "the stellar wind of a high - mass star can blow a cavity around the progenitor star @xcite with relatively low ism density , so that @xmath12 kyr .",
    "in such a case b(t ) can decay as @xmath13 , until the field is low enough for the x - ray flux to drop below the typical sensitivity levels . as a result ,",
    "in a scenario where the magnetic field decays as a function of time , the synchrotron emission will also fade as the pwn evolves .",
    "the reduced synchrotron losses for high - energy e@xmath0 for such a scenario will then lead to increased lifetimes for these leptonic particles . for timescales shorter than the inverse - compton lifetime of the e@xmath0 ( @xmath14 years )",
    ", this will result in an accumulation of vhe e@xmath0 ( e.g. seen in hess j1825 - 137 ) which will also lead to an increased @xmath2-ray production via ic . to summarize , during their evolution pwn",
    "may appear as @xmath2-ray sources with only very faint low - energy counterparts and this may represent a viable model for many unidentified tev sources .",
    "this effect can be clearly modeled , tested on young pwne such as the crab or g21.5 - 0.9 , and finally applied to some candidate ancient pwne such as hess j1427 - 608 and hess j1507 - 622 .",
    "in this code ( work in progress ) we adopted the time evolution of the lepton spectrum of @xcite ( eq . 7 and 11 ) , and the source function for the system @xmath15 given by @xcite    @xmath16    where the normalisation factors @xmath17 are determined using the prescription that the energy in the lepton spectrum should be some fraction of the spin - down luminosity @xmath18 : @xmath19 . note that the two normalisation factors are solved independently , with the only requirement that @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution of the spin - down luminosity is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the characteristic spin - down time - scale of the pulsar .",
    "the synchrotron @xmath23 and escape @xmath24 time - scales can respectively be approximated by @xcite @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    since @xmath7 until the passage of the rs , the evolution of the radius of the pwn can be approximated by    @xmath27        where @xmath28 is a normalisation constant and @xmath29 yr the time needed for the rs of the supernova shell remnant to reach the pwn . for the pwn radius",
    "we assume a power - law expansion with index 1.4 before the passage of the rs and index 0.2 after it .      in order to test the consistency of our code we tested it on the crab nebula and on g21.5 - 0.9 , obtaining compatible results with @xcite and with its previous version @xcite @xcite .",
    "the derived value for the magnetic field of g21.5 - 0.9 is similar to the value estimated for the 950 yr old crab nebula .",
    "other parameters derived are listed in tab .",
    "1 . the results , shown in fig . 1 and summarized in tab",
    ". 1 , demonstrate that the new code is describing well the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of g21.5 - 0.9 . in order to fit the radio and x - ray synchrotron emission ,",
    "it is necessary for the e@xmath30 spectrum to have a discontinuity between the two parts of the broken power - law .",
    "a similar feature has been discussed by @xcite to account for the emission from the vela pwn . despite the different parent e@xmath0 spectrum ,",
    "the results are compatible with @xcite .",
    "after testing the validity of the code on young , well - known pwne , we test it on unidentified high - energy @xmath2-ray sources and especially on the so called `` dark sources '' , i.e. on the @xmath2-ray sources that , even after deep multi - wavelength observations , lack any plausible x - ray counterparts ( such as hess j1507 - 622 , hess j1427 - 608 , hess j1708 - 410 and hess j1616 - 508 ) . here",
    "we show the results on hess j1507 - 622 and hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig . 2 and in tab . 1 , showing that our new code describes the seds also of these 2 `` dark sources '' very well , strengthening the idea that we are dealing with ancient pwne .",
    "it is important to underline that for hess j1507 - 622 ( the best example for this kind of sources @xcite and the most challenging for the model , especially given the very low radio upper limit ) the age ( 15 kys ) is perfectly compatible with the estimation derived in @xcite , as is the distance ( 6 kpc ) with the lower limit of @xcite .",
    "moreover , since there is no pulsar detected in the region of hess j1507 - 622 or hess j1427 - 608 ( as expected for such old pwne that the pulsar could have already spun down below the sensitivity of the current instruments @xcite ) , an arbitrary choice of the initial conditions for the pulsar parameters is required ; moreover , in order to fit the data for hess j1507 - 622 , we need a current magnetic field of about 0.3 @xmath31 g .",
    "this value is compatible with the upper limit of 0.5 @xmath31 g derived in @xcite , however we should underline that this value is smaller than the ism magnetic field ( that would raise again the question of section 3 of @xcite ) .",
    ".model parameters for the three sources discussed in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our new code represents an useful tool to describe pwne , since it could describe so far both their young and aged phases .",
    "the preliminary results on the three sources shown here are summarized in tab .",
    "1 . together with the new high - energy observations @xcite",
    ", it is strengthening the idea that vhe unidentified sources can indeed explained as ancient pwne . regarding the used model",
    ", we notice that : ( 1 ) the e@xmath0 energy spectrum needs to be described by a discontinuous broken power - law in order to simultaneously fit all the mwl data ; and ( 2 ) the fraction of spin - down power needed for the higher - energy part of the e@xmath0 spectrum is found to be @xmath3210 times smaller than the energy needed for the low - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the consequences on galactic and extragalactic ( e.g. starburst galaxies @xcite ) astrophysics , and consequently on crs studies , are remarkable and already discussed in @xcite @xcite @xcite ."
