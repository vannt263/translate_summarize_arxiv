    "feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is considered to be one of the important processes in regulating galaxy growth over cosmic time .",
    "several research groups have implemented agn feedback in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however they all have to assume a subgrid model for the accretion onto smbh and feedback with uncertain parameters due to limited resolution in cosmological simulations .    here",
    "we take a different approach and perform small - scale simulations of gas accretion onto smbh using the gadget-3 sph code ( originally described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on small - scales of @xmath2pc .",
    "our long - term goal is to develop a better model of agn feedback for large - scale cosmological simulations based on the results of small - scale bh accretion simulations . in this article ,",
    "we report our initial results of adiabatic bondi accretion simulations , as well as those with radiative cooling and heating by x - rays from the central smbh @xcite .",
    "we run a large set of simulations of spherically symmetric bondi accretion with different resolution , volume , and initial conditions .",
    "the bondi problem is ideal for testing any hydrodynamic code , since it has a semi - analytic solution .",
    "the central smbh has a mass of @xmath3 , and the initial conditions are generated using @xmath4 , @xmath5g/@xmath6 , and @xmath7k .",
    "the corresponding bondi radius is @xmath8pc , the bondi time is @xmath9yrs , and the sonic radius is @xmath10pc .",
    "the total initial mass of the gas sphere is in the range of @xmath11 depending on the setup , and the particle counts were varied between @xmath12 for resolution test .",
    "the inner boundary radius is @xmath13pc from the central smbh , and we regard that the particle is accreted to smbh once it crosses @xmath14 .",
    "the outer boundary radius was varied between @xmath15pc . for the full list of runs and parameters ,",
    "see table  1 of @xcite .",
    "first we find that the adiabatic simulations reproduce the expected bondi solution very well for a limited time . since the gas particles near the outer boundary escape due to adiabatic expansion , after a certain time the mass accretion rate start to decrease from the bondi rate .",
    "this is a problem owing to the difficulty of setting a boundary condition in the sph method , and it does not arise with the mesh codes , as one can simply fix the outer boundary with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    in the second set of runs with radiative cooling and heating by x - rays , we follow the approximate treatment of @xcite and @xcite , assuming that the 10 kev bremsstrahlung radiation from the central smbh is illuminating the optically thin gas . in figure",
    "[ fig : profile ] , we show the particle radial profile for various quantities in a run with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the eddington luminosity . we find that the simulation roughly follows the bondi flow solution even with the x - ray heating and cooling , except at @xmath20pc where we see a spurious heating due to artificial viscosity ( av ) of sph particles .",
    "we have confirmed that this effect is due to av by turning it on and off . with no av ,",
    "the overheating does not occur , and the gas particles overshoot the smbh due to lack of viscosity and many are not accreted .",
    "the mass inflow rate at @xmath14 in this run is enhanced over the bondi accretion rate by a factor of a few due to cooling .",
    "to study the effect of x - ray thermal feedback , we gradually increase @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 . in these runs",
    ", the initial condition contains 12.7 million particles for a gas sphere of @xmath24 , each gas particle mass of @xmath25 , adiabatic index @xmath26 , @xmath27pc , @xmath28g/@xmath6 , and @xmath29k .",
    "the bondi radius for these parameters is 183.9pc , therefore most of our computational volume is within the bondi radius and we fully resolve below the bondi radius with minimum smoothing length of @xmath30pc . in general we find that , with increasing @xmath1 , the mass accretion rate at @xmath14 decreases , and the outflow rate at @xmath31 increases .",
    "when @xmath1 becomes @xmath32 , we start to see an interesting transition from inflow to outflow , and non - spherical fragmentation of gas into multiphase medium takes place due to thermal instability .",
    "the filamentary cold gas continues to flow in , and the hot gas tries to escape through the channels between cold filaments .",
    "examination of the flow motion shows that the filaments get stretched , fragments , and the ` clouds ' merge .",
    "such fragmentation of accreting gas can assist in the formation of clouds around agn , induce star - formation , and contribute to the observed variability of narrow - line regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhotemp ] shows an example of such multiphase structure in a run with @xmath33 , when the outflow is still not very prominent and the hot gas is still being accreted to smbh . studies with 1d & 2d zeus simulation shows that this fragmentation does not occur in a spherically symmetric bondi flow , unless some perturbation is introduced by hand .",
    "the sph simulations inherently have tiny fluctuations in the density field due to its algorithmic nature , which can be amplified through thermal instability .    as @xmath1",
    "is increased to @xmath34@xmath35 , the outflow starts to dominate over the inflow , and the hot gas escapes through the channels between cold filaments , as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : highlx ] .",
    "we find that the transition from inflow to outflow occurs in - between @xmath36 , but note that this transition luminosity would depend on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , the more relevant parameter for the transition is the range of photoionization parameter @xmath37 for the unstable branch of the @xmath38 equilibrium curve .    with a high enough @xmath1 ( @xmath39 )",
    ", a strong outflow is produced due to strong thermal feedback , and the mass outflow rate at @xmath40 increases dramatically .",
    "a jet - like plume of hot and buoyant gas escapes from the central region to the outer boundary , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : highlx ] .",
    "these results on the non - spherical flow have been reported in our second paper in series @xcite , where we examined the @xmath38 equilibrium curve in detail and determine the unstable @xmath41-range .",
    "we find that gadget-3 sph code can reproduce the spherically symmetric bondi accretion flow properly with mainly two limitations : 1 ) the gas particles escape from the outer boundary due to adiabatic expansion ; 2 ) spurious heating is observed near the inner boundary around smbh due to the artificial viscosity of sph .",
    "we also examined the impact of radiative cooling and heating due to x - rays .",
    "the accretion flow roughly follows the bondi solution when the central x - ray luminosity is relatively low , but the mass accretion rate at @xmath14 is enhanced by a factor of a few over the bondi accretion rate due to cooling .",
    "the simulation starts to exhibit non - spherical fragmentation due to thermal instability once @xmath1 exceeds @xmath42 . at @xmath43 , the hot gas escapes in - between the cold filaments .",
    "when @xmath1 is further increased to @xmath44 , the outflow completely dominates over the inflow , and most of the gas escapes from the computational volume .",
    "a jet - like outflow feature is also observed at this @xmath1 , which selects a preferential direction for hot gas to escape rapidly .",
    "such non - spherical features of accreting gas can assist in the formation of clouds around agn , induce star - formation , and contribute to the observed variability of narrow - line regions .    in the future",
    ", we plan to implement rotation , radiation pressure , and different initial geometry of gas distribution .",
    "we will measure the efficiencies of thermal , radiative , and kinetic feedback , and compare them with those measured by @xcite and those used in the cosmological simulations .",
