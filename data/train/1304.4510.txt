    "the fundamental laws of particle physics , in our current understanding , depend on 28 constants including the gravitational constant , @xmath11 , the mass , @xmath12 , and charge , @xmath13 , of the electron , the masses of six quarks , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , the planck constant , @xmath20 , the sommerfeld constant @xmath0 , the coupling constants of the weak , @xmath21 , and strong , @xmath22 , interactions , etc .",
    "the numerical values of these constants are not calculated within the standard model and remain , as feynman wrote about the fine structure constant @xmath0 in 1985 , `` one of the greatest mysteries of physics ''  @xcite .",
    "however , it is natural to ask whether these constants are really constants , or whether they vary with the age of the universe , or over astronomical distances .",
    "the idea that the fundamental constants may vary on the cosmological time scale has been discussing in different forms since 1937 , when milne and dirac argued about possible variations of the newton constant @xmath11 during the lifetime of the universe  @xcite . over the past few decades",
    ", there have been extensive searches for persuasive evidences of the variation of physical constants .",
    "so far , there was found no one of them .",
    "the current limits for dimensionless constants such as the fine structure constant , @xmath23 , and the electron to proton mass ratio , @xmath24 , obtained in laboratory experiments and from the oklo natural reactor are on the order of one part in @xmath25  @xcite and one part in @xmath26  @xcite per year , respectively .",
    "the detailed discussion of ideas behind laboratory experiments can be found in a review  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the constants are linearly dependent on the cosmic time , the same order of magnitude constraints on the fractional changes in @xmath27 and in @xmath28 are stemming from astronomical observations of extragalactic objects at redshifts @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "less stringent constraints at a percent level have been obtained from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at @xmath30  @xcite and big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) at @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "we note that space and/or time dependence of @xmath0 based on optical spectra of quasars and discussed in the literature  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) is still controversial and probably caused by systematic effects since independent radio - astronomical observations , which are more sensitive , show only null results for both @xmath32 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , it looks as if the einstein heuristic principle of local position invariance ( lpi )   _ the outcome of any local non - gravitational experiment is independent of where and when in the universe it is performed _   is valid all over the universe , i.e. , at the level of @xmath33 neither @xmath0 no @xmath1 deviate from their terrestrial values for the passed @xmath34 yr . in the milky way , it was also found no statistically significant deviations of @xmath9  from zero at even more deeper level of @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "however , the violation of the lpi was predicted in some theoretical models such as , for example , the theory of superstrings which considers time variations of @xmath0 , @xmath21 , and the qcd scale @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath1 since @xmath37 ) and thereby opening a new window on physics beyond the standard model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "if the fundamental constants are found to be changing in space and time , then they are not absolute but dynamical quantities which follow some deeper physical laws that have to be understood .",
    "already present upper limits on the variation of the fundamental constants put very strong constraints on the theories beyond the standard model  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "this motivates the need for more precise laboratory and astronomical tests of the lpi . of course , there are also other attempts to look for the new physics . for example",
    "the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the elementary particles are very sensitive to the different extensions of the standard model .",
    "present limit on the edm of the electron significantly constrains supersymmetrical models and other theories  @xcite .    in this review",

    "speaking about stable matter , as , for example , atoms and molecules , we have only seven physical constants that describe their spectra  @xcite : @xmath40 the qcd scale parameter @xmath36 and the masses of the light quarks u , d , and s contribute to the nucleon mass @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) and , thus , the electron - to - proton mass ratio @xmath1 is a physical constant characterizing the strength of electroweak interaction in terms of the strong interaction .    in the nonrelativistic limit and for an infinitely heavy pointlike nucleus",
    "all atomic transition frequencies are proportional to the rydberg constant , @xmath43 , and the ratios of atomic frequencies do not depend on any fundamental constants .",
    "relativistic effects cause corrections to atomic energy , which can be expanded in powers of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the leading term being @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is atomic number .",

    "astronomical differential measurements of the dimensionless constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 are based on the comparison of the line centers in the absorption / emission spectra of cosmic objects and the corresponding laboratory values .",
    "it follows that the uncertainties of the laboratory rest frequencies and the line centers in astronomical spectra are the prime concern of such measurements .",

    "unfortunately , optical and uv transitions of atoms and molecules are not very sensitive to changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients of atomic resonance transitions of usually observed in quasar spectra chemical elements ( c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , s , ca , ti , cr , mn , fe , co , ni , zn ) are very small , @xmath76  @xcite .",
    "the same order of magnitude sensitivity coefficients to @xmath1 variations have been calculated for the uv transitions in the lyman and werner bands of molecular hydrogen h@xmath5  @xcite , and for the uv transitions in the 4@xmath77 positive band system @xmath78 of carbon monoxide co  @xcite .",
    "small values of @xmath75 and @xmath79 put tough constraints on optical methods to probe @xmath7  and @xmath9 .",

    "this gives us the maximum value of @xmath84 which is known with an error of @xmath85% . from ( [ sect2eq6 ] )",
    "it follows that a variance of @xmath86 would induce a velocity offset @xmath87 km  s@xmath88  between the 1608   line and any of the line with @xmath83  .",
    "we may neglect uncertainties of the rest frame wavelengths since they are @xmath89 km  s@xmath88  @xcite .",
    "if both iron line centers are measured in quasar spectra with the same error @xmath90 , then the error of the offset @xmath64 is @xmath91 .",
    "the error @xmath92 is a statistical estimate of the uncertainty of @xmath64 , and , hence , it should be less than the absolute value of @xmath64 .",
    "this gives us the following inequality to adjust parameters of spectral observations required to probe @xmath7  at a given level : @xmath93 at @xmath94 , the required position accuracy should be @xmath95 km  s@xmath88 .",
    "a typical error of the line center of an unsaturated absorption line in quasar spectra is about 1/10@xmath77 of the pixel size ( the wavelength interval between pixels )  @xcite .",
    "current observations with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) provide a pixel size @xmath96  , i.e. , at @xmath97   the expected error @xmath90 should be @xmath98 km  s@xmath88 , which is comparable to the velocity offset due to a fractional change in @xmath0 at the level of @xmath99 .",
    "such a critical relationship between the ` signal ' ( expected velocity offset @xmath100 ) and the error @xmath90 hampers measuring @xmath7 at the level of @xmath101 from any absorption system taking into account all imperfections of the spectrograph and the data reduction procedure .",
    "systematic errors exceeding 0.5 km  s@xmath88  are known to be typical for the wavelength calibration in both the vlt / uves and keck / hires spectrographs  @xcite . at this level of the systematic errors an estimate of @xmath7  from any individual absorption - line system",
    "must be considered as an _ upper limit _ but not a ` signal ' .",
    "otherwise , a formal statistical analysis of such values may lead to unphysical results ( examples can be found in the literature ) .",
    "the uv molecular spectra of h@xmath5 and co observed at high redshifts in the optical wavelength band encounter with similar difficulties and restrictions .",
    "the maximum difference between the sensitivity coefficients in case of h@xmath5 is @xmath102 , the rest frame wavelength uncertainties are negligible , @xmath103  @xcite , and with the current spectral facilities at giant telescopes it is hard to get estimates of @xmath9  at a level deeper than @xmath99 .",
    "for carbon monoxide such measurements have not been done so far but the expected limit on @xmath9  should be @xmath104 since co lines are much weaker than h@xmath5  @xcite and therefore their line centers are less certain .",
    "the analogue of eq.([sect2eq6 ] ) for the @xmath1-estimation from a pair of molecular lines is  @xcite : @xmath105 and for a given level of @xmath9 , molecular line centers should be measured with an error @xmath106 this means that at @xmath107 , the required position accuracy should be @xmath108 km  s@xmath88 , or the pixel size @xmath109   at 4000  .",
    "this requirement was realized in the vlt / uves observations of the quasar q0347383",
    "@xcite where a limit on @xmath9  of @xmath110 was set .    at present",
    "the only way to probe variation of the fundamental constants on the cosmological timescale at a level deeper than @xmath99 is to switch from optical to far infrared and microwave bands . in the microwave , or submillimeter range",
    "there are a good deal of molecular transitions arising in galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "electronic , vibrational , and rotational energies in molecular spectra are scaled as @xmath111 .",
    "in other words , the sensitivity coefficients for pure vibrational and rotational transitions are equal to @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "besides , molecules have fine and hyperfine structures , @xmath114-doubling , hindered rotation , accidental degeneracy between narrow close - lying levels of different types , which have a specific dependence on the physical constants .",
    "the advantage of radio observations is that some of these molecular transitions are approximately 100 - 1000 times more sensitive to variations of @xmath1 and/or @xmath0 than optical and uv transitions .    in the far infrared waveband",

    "we can combine observations of these lines and rotational molecular transitions to probe a combination @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "besides , radio - astronomical observations allow us to measure emission lines from molecular clouds in the milky way with an extremely high spectral resolution ( channel width @xmath89 km  s@xmath88 ) leading to stringent constraints at the level of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the level @xmath117 is a natural limit for radio - astronomical observations since it requires the rest frequencies of molecular transitions to be known with an accuracy better than 100 hz . at the moment",

    "we are mainly dealing with molecular lines observed in microwave and submillimeter ranges in the interstellar medium , but a few low - frequency transitions with high sensitivities are also included in our analysis just to extend the list of possible targets for future studies at the next generation of large telescopes for low - frequency radio astronomy .",
    "we start our analysis of the microwave spectra of molecules from the simplest systems  diatomic molecules with nonzero projection of the electronic angular momentum @xmath118 on the molecular axis .",
    "several such molecules are observed in the interstellar medium .",

    "for example , for the symmetric isotopologues of ammonia we get :    [ q_nh3 ] @xmath362    such a weak dependence on the tunneling frequency limits possible values of the sensitivity coefficients for tunneling transitions in the microwave range : @xmath363 .",
    "this is quite good , compared to the rotational sensitivity @xmath364 , but smaller than the best sensitivities in linear molecules considered above .",
    "let us consider mixed tunneling - rotational transitions , where tunneling goes along with the change of the rotational quantum numbers .",
    "if we neglect interaction between tunneling and rotational degrees of freedom we can write approximate expressions for the frequency and the sensitivity of the mixed inversion - rotational transition :    [ appox_mix ] @xmath365    we are particularly interested in the case when the minus sign in is realized and @xmath366 . for this case the tunneling sensitivity is enhanced by the factor @xmath367 and resultant sensitivity of the mixed transition is inversely proportional to the transition frequency @xmath368 .",
    "therefore , _ for the mixed transitions we can have much higher sensitivities in the observable frequency range , then for the purely tunneling transitions . _    another important advantage of the mixed transitions is that there are usually many of them each having different sensitivity .",
    "this means that we can have very good control on possible systematics and reliably estimate the accuracy of the results for @xmath1-variation .",
    "the mixed transitions can not be observed in the symmetric isotopologues of ammonia , but they are observed in the partly deuterated species nh@xmath5d and nhd@xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , for both of them the tunneling frequency is much smaller then all rotational frequencies and sensitivities are not large  @xcite : @xmath369    relatively small sensitivity coefficients for deuterated isotopologues of ammonia and their low abundance does not allow to get strong limits on @xmath1-variation , so we need to use tunneling ammonia line .",
    "it was observed from the several objects with the redshifts about unity .",
    "measuring radial velocities for rotational lines and for the ammonia tunneling line we have @xmath370 in eq .",
    "( [ sect2eq8 ] ) , which is two orders of magnitude larger than for optical lines .",
    "because of that the ammonia method allowed to place more stringent bounds on @xmath1-variation than bounds , which follow from the optical spectra of the hydrogen molecule . however , recent observations of the molecules with mixed tunneling - rotational transitions provide even higher sensitivity to @xmath1-variation .",
    "equations show that high sensitivity mixed transitions are possible when tunneling frequency is of the same order of magnitude as rotational constants .",
    "however , in this case tunneling and rotational degrees of freedom start to interact and the accuracy of approximation decreases .",
    "a much better approximation can be reached with the help of the effective hamiltonians , which describe rotational and tunneling degrees of freedom and their interactions with each other . at present the state of the art",
    "effective hamiltonians can include on the order of hundred parameters .",
    "these parameters are fitted to the experimentally known transitions and provide an accuracy on the ppm scale , or better .",
    "when such hamiltonians are used to find sensitivity coefficients @xmath192 we need to know how all the parameters depend on @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this can usually be done only within an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the final accuracy for the large @xmath75-factors is somewhat lower because of the instability of eq .",

    "later on the theory was refined many times and currently there is a very impressive agreement between the theory and experiment  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients to the @xmath1-variation for methanol microwave transitions were calculated independently in  @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "the first group used the state of the art effective hamiltonian  @xcite , which included 120 fitting parameters .",
    "the second group used a much simpler model  @xcite .",

    "both effective hamiltonians were diagonalized for several sets of parameters , which correspond to an increased and decreased @xmath1 and the sensitivity coefficients were found by the numerical differentiation .",
    "the comparison of the two calculations is given in fig .",
    "we see that in spite of a significant difference in complexity of the models the results are in good agreement and of the comparable accuracy . as we discussed above , the latter is mostly determined by ambiguity in the @xmath1-scaling of model parameters .",

    "this is more than an order of magnitude larger than in ammonia method .",
    "moreover , in methanol we have a large number of strong lines with different sensitivities and can effectively control possible systematic effects . until very recently methanol was observed only at small redshifts , but in 2011 it was first detected in the microwave survey towards the object pks 1830 - 211 at redshift @xmath433  @xcite .",
    "this means that at present methanol can be used as a very sensitive tool to probe @xmath1-variation on a cosmological timescale  @xcite .    in the same survey",
    "@xcite , a large number of rather complex molecules were detected for the first time at high redshift .",
    "in particular , the list includes methylamine   yet another molecule with tunneling motion . in contrast to all previously discussed molecules",

    "first is hindered rotation of the nh@xmath5 around ch@xmath3 top , which is similar to that in methanol .",
    "second is a wagging mode when the nh@xmath5 group flips over to the other side ( see fig .",
    "[ fg8 ] ) .",
    "both modes contribute to the angular momentum of the molecule and , therefore , strongly interact with the overall rotation .",
    "the spectrum of methylamine is also very rich .",
    "the effective hamiltonian must include both tunneling motions and their interactions with each other and with the overall rotation .",
    "therefore , even the simplest form of this hamiltonian is quite complex and we will not discuss it here .",
    "calculations of the sensitivity coefficients were recently done in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that they lie in the range @xmath434 .",
    "however , the lines , which were observed in  @xcite at @xmath433 have sensitivities close to 1 . up to now neither of the more sensitive lines of methylamine has been observed at high redshifts .",
    "there are several other molecules with mixed tunneling - rotational spectra , for example n@xmath5h@xmath435 and ch@xmath3sh .",
    "the former has three tunneling modes which strongly interact with rotation .",
    "thus , we should expect very complex spectrum .",
    "this molecule is predicted to form in jupiter s and titan s atmospheres  @xcite .",
    "the latter is similar to methanol and exhibits hindered rotation and complex spectrum  @xcite .",
    "effective hamiltonians for many of these molecules are known , but no other calculations of the sensitivity coefficients have been done so far ( preliminary results for ch@xmath3sh show that there are transitions with high sensitivities of both signs ) . if any new sufficiently low frequency mixed transitions are observed from the interstellar medium , it is possible to calculate respective sensitivity coefficients using the methods outlined in this section .",
    "as we discussed in the previous sections the constraints on the possible variation of fundamental constants are an efficient method of testing the equivalence principle which is a basic assumption of general relativity .",
    "these constraints can be derived from a wide variety of atomic and molecular transitions observed in laboratory , solar and extra solar systems , and at very early cosmological epochs up to a redshift of order @xmath436 where molecular and atomic transitions have been recently detected and observed with a sufficiently high spectral resolution  @xcite .",
    "radio astronomical observations of the nh@xmath3 molecule in two distant galaxies provide tight constraints at the @xmath9  @xmath437 level at @xmath438  @xcite and @xmath439  @xcite .",
    "even deeper bounds were deduced from observations of the ch@xmath3oh molecule in the @xmath438 galaxy : @xmath9  @xmath440  @xcite , and @xmath9@xmath441  @xcite .    to probe @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the level of @xmath442 or @xmath117 , at least two main requirements should be fulfilled : ( @xmath443 ) increasing precision of the laboratory measurements of the rest frame frequencies of the most sensitive molecular transitions discussed in this review , and ( @xmath444 ) increasing sensitivity and spectral resolution of astronomical observations .",
    "the most promising molecular transitions are those of a mixed nature , where there are two , or more , competing contributions to the transition energy .",
    "we get strong enhancement of the sensitivity to the variation of the fundamental constants when the resultant transition frequency is much smaller than individual contributions .",
    "this happens , for example , for some mixed tunneling - rotational transitions .",
    "diatomic radicals give another example , where spin - orbit interaction is competing with coriolis interaction . as a result",
    "we have strong enhancement of the sensitivity coefficients for the @xmath114-doublet transitions .",
    "there are other known examples , which are more relevant for the laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that more examples will be found both for the laboratory and astrophysical studies .",

    "<S> this review summarizes the theoretical background on quantum - mechanical calculations of the sensitivity coefficients of such transitions to tiny changes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a number of molecules which are usually observed in galactic and extragalactic sources , and discusses the possibility of testing the space- and time - invariance of fundamental constants through comparison between precise laboratory measurements of the molecular rest frequencies and their astronomical counterparts . </S>",
