    "a parameter    value determines a so - called _",
    "function instance_. for example ,    @xmath13 encodes the location of the optimum of    single - objective functions , which means that different instances have    shifted optima . in the test suite , @xmath14 and the function    instances are determined by the instances of the underlying    single - objective functions .",

    "the test suite provides 55 bi - objective functions in six dimensions ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 40 ) with a large number of possible instances .",
    "the 55 functions are derived from combining a subset of the 24 well - known single - objective functions of the test suite [ index : id3 ] which has been used since 2009 in the http://numbbo.github.io/workshops[bbob workshop series ] .",
    "while concrete details on each of the 55 functions are given in section , we will detail here the main rationale behind them together with their common properties .",
    "[ index : the - single - objective - bbob - functions ] the test suite is designed to be able to assess performance of algorithms with respect to well - identified difficulties in optimization typically occurring in real - world problems . a multi - objective problem being a combination of single - objective problems , one can obtain multi - objective problems with representative difficulties by simply combining single objective functions with representative difficulties observed in real - world problems . for this purpose",
    "we naturally use the single - objective suite [ index : id5 ] .    combining all 24 functions in pairs",
    "thereby results in @xmath23 bi - objective functions overall .",
    "we however assume that multi - objective optimization algorithms are not sensitive to permutations of the objective functions such that combining the 24 functions and taking out the function @xmath24 if the function @xmath25 is present results in @xmath26 functions .    some first tests , e.g. in [ index : id6 ] , showed that having 300 functions is impracticable in terms of the overall running time of the benchmarking experiment .",
    "we then decided to exploit the organization of the functions into classes to choose a subset of functions .",
    "more precisely , the 24 original functions are grouped into five function classes where each class gathers functions with similar properties , namely    1 .",
    "separable functions 2 .   functions with low or moderate conditioning 3",
    ".   functions with high conditioning and unimodal 4 .",
    "multi - modal functions with adequate global structure , 5 .",
    "multi - modal functions with weak global structure .    to create the suite , we choose two functions within each class . this way we do not introduce any bias towards a specific class . in addition within each class ,",
    "the functions are chosen to be the most representative without repeating similar functions .",
    "for example , only one ellipsoid , one rastrigin , and one gallagher function are included in the suite although they appear in separate versions in the suite .",
    "finally our choice of 10 functions for creating the test suite is the following :    * separable functions * * sphere ( function 1 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * * ellipsoid separable ( function 2 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * functions with low or moderate conditioning * * attractive sector ( function 6 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * * rosenbrock original ( function 8 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * functions with high conditioning and unimodal * * sharp ridge ( function 13 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * * sum of different powers ( function 14 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * multi - modal functions with adequate global structure * * rastrigin ( function 15 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * * schaffer f7 , condition 10 ( function 17 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * multi - modal functions with weak global structure * * schwefel x*sin(x ) ( function 20 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] ) * * gallagher 101 peaks ( function 21 in https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00362633 [ suite ] )        from combining the original function classes , we obtain 15 function classes to structure the 55 bi - objective functions of the test suite .",

    ", several general properties of objective functions will be mentioned that are defined here in short .",
    "it depends on these properties whether the optimization problem is easy or hard to solve .",
    "a _ separable _ function does not show any dependencies between the variables and can therefore be solved by applying @xmath1 consecutive one - dimensional optimizations along the coordinate axes while keeping the other variables fixed . consequently , _ non - separable _ problems must be considered .",
    "they are much more difficult to solve .",
    "the typical well - established technique to generate non - separable functions from separable ones is the application of a rotation matrix @xmath103 to @xmath104 , that is @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a separable function .",
    "a _ unimodal _ function has only one local minimum which is at the same time also its global one .",
    "multimodal _ function has at least two local minima which is highly common in practical optimization problems .",
    "_ ill - conditioning _ is another typical challenge in real - parameter optimization and , besides multimodality , probably the most common one . in a general case",
    ", we can consider a function as ill - conditioned if for solution points from the same level - set `` the minimal displacement [ ... ] that produces a given function value improvement differs by orders of magnitude '' [ index : id14 ] .",
    "conditioning can be rigorously formalized in the case of convex quadratic functions , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a symmetric positive definite matrix , as the condition number of the hessian matrix @xmath108 .",
