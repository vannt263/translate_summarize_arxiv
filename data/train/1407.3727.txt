    "it also appears when electromagnetic waves interact with optical phonons in dielectric crystals @xcite .    in the literature",
    ", another type of combination resonance , namely the difference combination resonance , has been discussed in mechanical systems since the 1960 s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it can occur when the driving frequency matches the frequency difference between two normal frequencies @xmath5which yields amplification of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "combination resonances affect dynamic stability of structures and appear in various systems having multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "recently , the difference combination resonance has been experimentally demonstrated in an electronic circuit in the radio frequency range and proposed as a mechanism of generation of high frequency coherent radiation ( e.g. xuv or x - rays ) utilizing a low frequency ( e.g. , infrared ) driving field @xcite .",
    "such a parametric amplifier , which operates by quantum amplification by superradiant emission of radiation , is called the qaser for short .",
