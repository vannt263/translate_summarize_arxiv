    "ads spacetimes in @xmath0dimensions has won notoriety since the norm / gravity correspondence was postulated in 1997 by maldacena @xcite and black holes in the gravity side are related with the temperature of the system in the field theory side .",
    "however the thermodynamic study of black holes in ads spacetime was initiated long before the duality ads / cft appeared by hawking and page @xcite as a curiosity in theoretical physics .",
    "they show that the schwarzschild - ads black hole has a phase transition and this quality attracted others to keep studying this objects in ads backgrounds .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm - ads ( rnads ) black hole in @xmath0dimensions has been studied in @xcite where they found that also rnads present a phase transition .",
    "later , some authors considered the cosmological constant as a new thermodynamical variable in ads black holes @xcite , extending in this way the phase space . recently , nonlinear electrodynamics source in ads - black holes rise interest in the community , but focusing in particular in the power maxwell invariant field ( pmi ) @xcite where a @xmath1 parameter is taken as a power of the maxwell term in the action , i.e. @xmath2 , which reduces to the maxwell field ( linear electromagnetic source ) when @xmath3 . in those theories the authors found that black holes with nonlinear source present a transition phase in both , the canonical ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble .    in order to describe the behaviour of the thermodynamic system by means of geometry",
    ", different approaches have been proposed @xcite which use a rimannian manifold to define a space of equilibrium states where the thermodynamic phenomena take place .",
    "these approaches introduce a metric by means of which the thermodynamic concepts are related to the geometry .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section [ gtd ]",
    ", we present the elements of the geometrothermodynamics formalism that will be used in this work to obtain the thermodynamical behaviour of the systems analyzed . in section [ termo ] , we present the black hole solution in ads spacetime with power invariant maxwell source ( pmi ) and the thermodynamic attributes of this system . in section [ secgtdpmi ] , we apply the geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) formalism to black holes with pmi source . in the section [ rn ] , we consider the case of the reissner - nordstr@xmath4 m black hole where ; its phase transitions are studied and we show that the legendre - invariant metric reproduces its corresponding phase transition structure .",
    "section [ weinhold ] , contains the results of analyzing the thermodynamics of the black holes with pmi source solution using the weinhold geometry . in section [ cosmological ] ,",
    "we analyze the thermodynamics behaviour of a black hole with pmi source considering the cosmological constant as a thermodynamical variable under gtd .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "geometrothermodynamics ( gtd ) @xcite is a geometric formalism associated to physical systems in order to obtain its thermodynamical behaviour .",
    "the first element to consider under this formalism is a contact manifold @xmath5 of dimension @xmath6 , called phase space , with a metric @xmath7 defined on it and a contact 1form @xmath8 that satisfies the condition @xmath9 . on this geometrical structure , @xmath10 ,",
    "can be use a set of coordinates @xmath11 and demand @xmath7 to be invariant by a total legendre transformation .",
    "this means that when it is performing a change of coordinates @xmath12 to @xmath13 that satisfies the transformations    [ gtd7 ] = -_a ^a , e^a=-^a , i^a=^a ,    then the new metric @xmath14 has the same structure as @xmath7 defined over its own set of coordinates .    in gtd , we can also define an embedding @xmath15 as @xmath16 with @xmath17 such that @xmath18 holds .",
    "the @xmath19dimensional riemannian submanifold @xmath20 is called the thermodynamic equilibrium space , @xmath21 is called the thermodynamic potential , @xmath22 are called extensive variables and @xmath23 are called intensive variables . with these geometric elements ,",
    "all the thermodynamic information of the system can be extracted by using the mapping @xmath24 and the condition of the pullback acting on @xmath8 .",
    "a gtd metric @xmath7 that satisfies the previous requirements and that we will be using in this work is given by    [ gtd6 ] g=^2+(_abe^a i^b)(_cdde^c di^d),where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and [ gtd4 ] = i_a , d= i_ade^a .",
    "we notice that equation @xmath28 must be explicitly given and it corresponds to the fundamental equation in standard thermodynamics .    applying the pullback @xmath29 to the metric @xmath7",
    ", we get the induced metric @xmath30 by @xmath31 resulting in [ gtd8 ] g^gtd=^*(g)= ( e^c ) ( _ ab ^bcde^a de^d ) .",
    "we can see that it is only necessary to know the fundamental equation @xmath28 to determine explicitly the metric @xmath30 on @xmath20 . according to the gtd prescription , once we have @xmath28 , we have all the requirements to associate the thermodynamics of the physical system to this geometrical structure .",
    "in particular , our principal interest is to obtain the phase transitions of the system which should correspond to singular points in the curvature scalar @xmath32 as proposed in gtd @xcite .",
    "this procedure to obtain the phase transitions of black holes systems with the gtd approach has been used successfully in previous works @xcite .",
    "the corresponding line element for the black hole with power maxwell invariant ( pmi ) source @xcite solution is ,    [ metric ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2++r^2 d^2_d-2,where @xmath33 stands for standard element on @xmath34 , with lapse function ,    [ equ11 ] f(r)=1 + - + .here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are related with the adm mass @xmath37 and the electric charge @xmath38 by means of the relation ,    [ equ31 ] m&= & , + [ equ312 ] q&=&^^q^.    the horizons of the black hole with pmi source metric correspond to the roots of the lapse function @xmath39 . in terms of the exterior horizon radius @xmath40",

    ", we will consider that the parameter @xmath1 satisfies the relationships @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with @xmath44 any integer and @xmath45 in order to keep real all terms in equation ( [ equ22 ] ) .",
    "the physical parameters of the black hole with pmi source satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xcite ,    [ flaw ] dm = tds+dq , where @xmath46 is the hawking temperature which is proportional to the surface gravity on the horizon and @xmath21 the electrical potential . as in ordinary thermodynamics ,",
    "all the thermodynamic information is contained in the fundamental equation .",
    "the standard conditions of the thermodynamic equilibrium are given by the expressions ,    [ c2 ] t= , = .",
    "according with the ehrenfest s classification @xcite the phase transitions take place where the derivatives of the gibbs free energy @xmath47 diverge , for example , the first - order phase transitions exhibit a discontinuity in the first derivative of the @xmath7 with respect to some thermodynamic variable and second - order phase transitions exhibit discontinuity in a second derivative of @xmath7 . because the heat capacity at constant electric charge @xmath48 is a second derivative of the free energy @xmath7 , it will be used to describe the second order phase transition structure of the system ,    [ c3 ] c_q=- t ( ) _ q = t ( ) _ q=.    using the equation ( [ equ5 ] ) it is possible to compute the heat capacity at constant electric charge .",
    "however , it is not possible to write this quantity in a compact form",
    ". therefore , we will take particular configurations of the black hole and its behaviour using different values of the parameter @xmath1 and @xmath19 . as an example of this analysis we consider the values @xmath49 and @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath48 has the form ,    [ c3 - 1 ] c_q=.     as a function of the entropy @xmath52 , for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath50.,width=377 ]    the second order phase transitions take place at those points where the heat capacity diverges , i. e.

    "the function @xmath62 is a polynomial that is different from zero at those points where the denominator vanishes .",

    "we conclude that weinhold geometry does not describe correctly the thermodynamic geometry for the black hole with pmi source or at least it is not possible to give an interpretation of this divergences .",
    "we interpret this result as the need to impose the legendre invariance in the context of the geometric analysis of the thermodynamics , since the weinhold metric are not invariant with respect to legendre transformations .    in the case where we consider the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable",
