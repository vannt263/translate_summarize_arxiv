    "cooperation is ubiquitous in nature @xcite and essential for evolution @xcite .",
    "how did cooperative behaviour evolve among self - interested individuals is an important open question in biology and social sciences .",
    "a powerful tool to analyse this issue is evolutionary game theory @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it originated as an application of the mathematical theory of games to biological contexts , has become of increased interest to economists , sociologists , and anthropologists as well as philosophers .",
    "of particular interest are two - player games where each player has a strategy space containing two actions or ` 2@xmath52 games ' . in the problem of cooperation vs. competition",
    "the two actions or strategies are : to cooperate ( c ) or to defect ( d ) .",
    "the payoff of a player depends on its action and the one of its coplayer .",
    "assuming symmetry between the two players , that they are interchangable , there are four possible values for this payoff @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath3 & @xmath8 , corresponding respectively to the four situations [ c , c ] , [ c , d ] , [ d , c ] & [ d , d ] ( the first entrance correspond to the action of the player and the second to the action of its opponent ) .",
    "the paradigmatic example is the _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) in which the four payoff are ranked as @xmath3@xmath9@xmath6@xmath9@xmath8@xmath9@xmath7 .",
    "so @xmath3 is the ` temptation ' to defect , @xmath6 is the ` reward ' for mutual cooperation @xmath8 the ` punishment ' for mutual defection and @xmath7 is the ` sucker s payoff ' .",
    "clearly it pays more to defect ( @xmath3@xmath9@xmath6 and @xmath8@xmath9@xmath7 ) but the dilemma is that if both play d they get @xmath8 that is worse than the reward @xmath6 they would have get if they had played c. the pd is connected with two other _ social dilemma _",
    "games @xcite , @xcite : when the damage from mutual defection is increased so that it finally exceeds the damage suffered by being exploited , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3@xmath9@xmath6@xmath9@xmath7@xmath9@xmath8 , the new game is called the _ chicken _ @xcite .",
    "this game applies thus to situations such that mutual defection is the worst possible outcome for both players as it happens in most of animal contests . on the other hand ,",
    "when the reward surpasses the temptation @xmath6@xmath9@xmath3@xmath9@xmath8@xmath9@xmath7 , the game becomes the _ stag hunt _",
    "( sh ) @xcite . there are several animal behaviours that have been described as stag hunts .",
    "for example , the coordination of slime molds . when individual amoebae of _ dictyostelium discoideum _ are starving , they aggregate to form one large body . here",
    "if they all act together they can successfully reproduce , however the success depends on the cooperation of many individuals .",
    "classical evolutionary game theory constitutes a mean - field approximation which does not include the effect of spatial structures of populations .",
    "axelrod @xcite suggested to place the individual  players \" in a two - dimensional spatial array playing with its neighbours .",
    "these cellular automata ( ca ) were explored by nowak and may @xcite who use a simple one - parameter payoff matrix specifying a game that is in the frontier between the pd and chicken .",
    "they found that the spatial structure allows cooperators to build clusters in which the benefits of mutual cooperation can outweight losses against defectors .",
    "this enables the maintenance of cooperation in contrast to the spatially unestructured game where defection is always favoured .",
    "different variations of this nowak - may ( n - m ) model were studied taking into account distinct aspects , like the changes introduced by modifying the update rule @xcite , the effect of allowing voluntary participation @xcite , the dependence on the graph topology @xcite,@xcite , the effect of noise and connectivity structure @xcite , the consequences of the environmental stress by requiring a minimum threshold to survive @xcite , etc .",
    "here my goal is to extend the n - m model in several directions with the aim to study the following issues .    1 .   _",
    "the consequences of an heterogeneous environment_. this can be modelled through a payoff matrix varying from place to place .",
    "for example , in a more hostile region the reward for mutual cooperation can surpass the temptation to defect leading thus to switching from the pd to the sh , etc .",
    "the effect of asymmetries in the interactions between the agents_. indeed , asymmetries in the costs and benefits of cooperating have been mentioned as an important ingredient in the evolution of cooperation @xcite .",
    "the emergence of payoff matrices from the very natural selection process_. the determination of the ranking of the payoff values to explain the results of experiments or field observations is a far from trivial matter .",
    "for instance , in the case of animals there is controversy whether the pd or chicken is the appropriate game @xcite . or many circumstances that have been described as pd might also be interpreted as a sh , depending on how fitness is calculated @xcite . moreover , experimental studies indicate that the payoff matrix is not a constant for very simple individuals like viruses @xcite .    hence , the basic idea is , instead of using the same universal payoff matrix , to use heterogeneous _ bimatrix _ games @xcite , each player has it own particular payoff matrix .",
    "i begin studying a first variant of this model , in which the cell payoff matrix is regarded as something completely external to the individual , corresponding to environmental properties .",
    "these properties change from place to place but not with time ( at least not in the temporal scale of the organisms ) and thus the matrix diversity is kept fixed during the evolution .",
    "then i focus on a second variant in which the cell payoff matrix is assumed to reflect ` phenotypic ' properties , internal to organisms , thus it evolves together with its strategy .",
    "the n - m model consists in a cellular automaton in which cells represent the simplest possible agents : unconditional players versus its neighbours .",
    "that is , at each generation or time step @xmath10 of the game , there are those who always play c and those who always play d. different types of neighbourhoods can be considered . for example",
    "the _ von neumann neighbourhood _ with @xmath11=4 neighbour cells ( above , below , left and right cells ) .",
    "the score @xmath12 of a given player is the sum of the payoffs it collects against its @xmath11 neighbours .",
    "the payoff matrix depends on just one parameter @xmath3 while the other three have fixed values : @xmath6=1 , @xmath7=@xmath8=0 .",
    "the dynamic is synchronous : all the agents update their states simultaneously at the end of each lattice sweep .",
    "natural selection is mimicked through the simplest imitate the best ( in the neighbourhood ) update rule @xcite : each individual , after playing against its neighbours , adopts the strategy of the most successful neighbour or @xmath13 ( the one that collected the highest utilities @xmath12 in the neighbourhood at this round ) .    in this work",
    "two variants of the n - m model are studied :    * _ heterogeneous non evolving temptation . _ + as a first step let s consider the version with the temptation parameter @xmath3 varying from cell to cell as a uniform random variable fixed in time : @xmath2 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the coordinates of the center of the cell .",
    "since @xmath8=@xmath7 , when @xmath141 the payoff matrix of the cell at ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) is in the frontier between the pd and the chicken , let s denote this game by @xmath15 . on the other hand , when @xmath161 the game played by the cell is in the frontier between the pd and the sh and let s denote it by @xmath17 . *",
    "_ heterogeneous evolving temptation_. + next i concentrate on the case in which the temptation , besides varying from cell to cell , evolves with time we have a variable @xmath4 depending on the cell coordinates as well as the time step or generation @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath21 is taken in [ 1,2.5 ] in steps of 0.1 , and for each of these values two values of @xmath18 are considered : 0 and 1 . since @xmath22 , the possible games are determined by @xmath18 : when @xmath18=1 the payoff matrix of every cell corresponds to @xmath15 .",

    "two variants implementing heterogeneous extensions of the n - m model were introduced and studied .",
    "these model versions can be regarded as two extreme situations : on the one hand , in the case of ` temptations ' @xmath2 constant in time , we have the external environment point of view .",
    "that is , the payoff matrix is regarded as something completely external to the individuals corresponding to the properties of physical background in which they are located .",
    "these properties change from place to place but not with time ( at least not in the temporal scale of the organisms ) preserving thus the original complete diversity of payoffs . for example , in sites where the environment is more hostile the reward for mutual cooperation may become better than the temptation leading to switching from the pd to the sh , etc .",
    "on the other hand , when the temptation evolves , we have the ` phenotypic ' point of view . in this case",
    ", one assumes that the payoff matrix reflects properties of an organism , is part of its phenotype , so it experiences natural selection .",
    "therefore the model can cope with diversity and asymmetric interactions between ` players ' either if they are product of an heterogeneous environment or of different ` phenotypes ' characterized by different temptations @xmath3 .",
    "that is , for multiple causes , it is possible that the payoffs for you and your opponent are not equal ( indeed this is what happens in general in real life ) .",
    "furthermore , as it was mentioned , an empirical determination of the payoffs can be very difficult while variations in the payoff values can dramatically alter theoretical predictions . here",
    ", one of my goals was to minimize the dependence of crucial model predictions , like the evolution of cooperation , on model parameters .",
    "so i have chosen the simplest agents -unconditional players ( without memory or strategic parameters)- and i have not introduced a universal temptation parameter @xmath3 for all the players . instead ,",
    "starting with random heterogeneous distributions of @xmath3 , i let that steady states with several domains characterized by different values of @xmath3 emerge from the very process of natural selection .",
    "all the results are quite robust and do not depend on particular payoffs choices , nor on the lattice topology or if the update is synchronous or asynchronous , and do not rely on specific characteristics of the agents .",
    "the dependence on the initial conditions is also mostly removed by taking averages .",
    "thus this really minimal model seems to combine robustness with realism and simplicity .",
    "both model variants yield a higher value of the asymptotic fraction of cooperators @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 than the one produced by the uniform n - m model .",
    "it is worth remarking that for this heterogeneous payoff matrix model , in general , @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 attains higher values for the the case of constant payoff matrices than for the evolving ones .",
    "also , for both model variants , in general , a diminution of @xmath18 ( from 1 to 0 ) promotes a higher level of cooperation .",
    "this seems natural since less competitive games ( limit cases of sh ) are allowed .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27 as a function of @xmath21= is approximately monotonic for constant payoff matrices while in the case of evolving payoff matrices it exhibits non - monotonic variations .",
    "so , in this second variant , an interesting ( unexpected ) prediction is that by allowing larger initial ` temptation ' payoffs @xmath33 the number of cooperators grows .    concerning the emergence of spatial patterns , the evolving temptation version organises into a steady state that exhibits a rich structure with several patches of agents using the same payoff matrix .",
    "in addition , all the agents that reach the steady state with values of @xmath51=1 ( when @xmath18=0 ) are cooperators .    in this work the evolution is driven just by natural selection .",
    "the effect of incorporating mutations , the other driving force of evolution , is something important to explore .",
    "work is in progress on that direction .",
    "nevertheless , preliminary results show that the main conclusions presented here remain qualitatively the same .",
    "it is also known that modifications of the update rule , and , in particular , an asynchronous dynamics may produce important changes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the effects of changing the update rule is something that deserves to be analysed separately in another work .",
    "i would like to thank one of the referees who pointed out the work of m. perc @xcite on heterogeneous games and the effects of additive chaotic variations to the payoff matrix of the spatial pd game .",
    "the author proposes that this disturbances can arise either by the player themselves or from the environment , situations that correspond to the two different model variants i study here ."
