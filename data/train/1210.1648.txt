    "past theoretical models have demonstrated that the tidal interactions between a protoplanetary disk and an embedded giant planet clean out the region around the planet s orbit and open up a gap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , the presence of a cavity in a protoplanetary disk as revealed by dust continuum emissions has at times been postulated as a potential signpost of an embedded gas giant planet ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "non - planetary explanations have also been proposed , e.g. grain growth , fast radial drift of dust , and photoevaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the aerodynamic drag is a well - known interaction between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the presence of a radial pressure gradient causes the azimuthal gas velocity to deviate from the circular keplerian motion , resulting in the super - keplerian or sub - keplerian motion . on the other hand , dust particles",
    "are unaffected by the pressure within the disk .",
    "the resulting discrepancy in the velocities gives rise to the drag force and hence a drift of the particles toward the pressure maxima ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this dust trapping mechanism has been previously applied to a circular disk with an embedded gas giant planet .",
    "for instance , the outer edge of the gap opened up by the planet can act as a filter to stall the radial drift of large particles in the outer disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , dust that is well - coupled to the gas can be temporarily trapped by the spiral density waves excited by the planet as the waves pass by @xcite .",
    "if the planet is sufficiently massive , the disk exterior to the planet s orbit can become moderately eccentric and start precessing on the secular timescale , depending on the disk mass and viscosity @xcite .",
    "eccentric protoplanetary disks in binary systems have also been observed in simulations as a result of the influence of a companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of eccentric disks in the su ursae majoris systems , which have been long proposed to account for the superhump light curves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the eccentricity is excited exponentially and secularly by the tidal forcing of the companion star via the 3:1 eccentric lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a linear analysis for the secular perturbations with the azimuthal mode number @xmath0 , and derived the so - called eccentricity equation for a gaseous disk .",
    "the equation describes the eccentric instability in terms of  eccentric modes \" , with the growth and precession rates determined by given disk properties such as sound - speed and density profiles ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the presence of dissipation that damps eccentricity",
    ", the slowly precessing disk finally settles into a steady state in which the eccentricity and longitude of pericenter are smooth functions of the disk radius .",
    "in such an eccentric protoplanetary disk harboring a massive planet , the orbits of dust particles would be eccentric as well due to the gas drag .",
    "the standard gas - dust dynamics as analyzed for circular orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "one straightforward approach for studying the dust behavior in eccentric disks is to utilize two - fluid ( gas + dust ) hydrodynamic simulations such as sph codes and rodeo @xcite .",
    "in fact , because several giant planets have been discovered in close stellar binaries ( binary separation @xmath1 20 au ) , a large body of the literature and considerable attention have been devoted to eccentric circumstellar disks in these binaries to examine the outcome of planetesimal collisions on the formation of giant planets ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for dust particles",
    ", @xcite performed 3d sph simulations to investigate the dynamics of dust with sizes from 0.1 mm to 1 cm in protoplanetary disks , including an eccentric disk driven by a planet of 5 jupiter masses on a fixed circular orbit at 40 au .",
    "after about 100 planetary orbits , they found that 1 cm - sized dust had accumulated in the strong spiral density waves just around the outer region of the gap in the disk in which the eccentricity is still evolving . at present , sph simulations are still computationally expensive .",
    "for a small perturber like a planet , a tremendous length of time is required to reach quasi - steady states for the study of any features related to secular effects",
    ".    therefore , for the sake of convenience , we run the fargo code @xcite to obtain the gas profile in a two - dimensional disk with a massive planet , and then employ the secular perturbation theory and incorporate aerodynamic drag @xcite to estimate the dust velocity and density that will in turn reveal the asymmetric structures inherent to an eccentric disk .",
    "the purpose of this study is to focus only on the secular behaviors of dust associated with an eccentric protoplanetary disk in the presence of a massive giant planet .",
    "therefore , non - secular effects , such as dust - gas dynamics in the horseshoe orbit and whether dust particles can drift toward the peaks of spiral density waves in an eccentric disk @xcite , are not studied in this work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we first describe the fiducial disk model for the study .",
    "we then briefly review the eccentricity equation for dust and explain our approach for solving the problem in  3 .",

    "modelling dust dynamics in the presence of a planet is described in the next session .",
    "since fargo is a hydrodynamical code and not formulated to simulate dust particles , our approach for dust dynamics in an eccentric gaseous disk is to consider the secular evolution of the dust using the secular perturbation theory , which gives rise to the eccentricity equation .",

    "given the drag force , the dust motion and surface density can then be deduced from the gas dynamics in the quasi - steady state of an eccentric disk in fargo .",
    "however , to compute the secular evolution of dust particles , we need to filter out the short - term evolution on the orbital timescale of the planet in the gas simulation .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the eccentric equation has been modified to include the gas drag and applied to planetesimals in a protoplanetary disk in binaries @xcite . as per paardekooper",

    "hence the particles smaller than one meter are well coupled to the gas by the strong gas drag .",
    "it is further validated in figure [ fig : vd - vg ] , which shows small fractional differences ( @xmath158 ) between the dust velocities in figure [ vrd_8000_5 ] and the gas velocities in the left panels of figure  [ fig : v_gas ] .. it is because in these regions @xmath145 or @xmath159 is close to zero ( see figure  [ fig : v_gas ] ) such that the slight phase difference in the velocity for the larger particle ( i.e. meter - sized ) leads to the larger fractional differences .",
    "hence , the narrow black regions do not indicate weak coupling between the gas and particles . ]",
    "similar results for strong dust - gas coupling are also found for the @xmath121 case ; the perturbed dust velocities ( not shown ) are almost identical to those displayed in the right panels of figures  [ fig : v_gas ] and the values of @xmath90 are on the same order as those for the @xmath120 case .",
    "figure  [ fig : ecc_ep=0 ] shows that in both the @xmath120 and @xmath121 cases , the eccentricity profile of the gas disk and that of the well - coupled dust coincide and decrease outwards from @xmath160 at @xmath140 .",
    "consequently , as in the case for the gas disk , the @xmath0 velocity fields for dust particles are more prominent in the region around the outer edge of the gap where the radial velocity associated with the eccentric orbit is up to about 744.8 m / s . the forced eccentricity @xmath161 is also plotted in the right panel of figure [ fig : ecc_ep=0 ] for comparison with the case where @xmath162 is non - zero .",
    "it is apparent that in the region that our study focuses on ( i.e. @xmath163 ) , the dust particles with size smaller than 1 m are so well - coupled to the gas that their eccentricity profiles are clearly distinct from @xmath164 , i.e. @xmath165 for @xmath101 from equation ( [ ecceq ] ) .",
    "consequently , all particles smaller than 1 m regress with the gas disk at the same rate in the steady state .",
    "the time - averaged surface densities for the 0.01 cm- and 100 cm - sized particles are shown in figure [ den_8000_5 ] .",
    "the @xmath120 case is plotted in the left panels and the @xmath121 case is presented in the right panels . by comparison with the bottom panels of figure [ fig : density_g ] , we can see that the @xmath0 distributions of the dust and gas density look similar .",
    "in fact , a more careful comparison indicates that the dust density distributions for all the cases are almost identical to the gas density distribution , as one would expect for well - coupled dust particles .",
    "the dust distributions are asymmetric in the exterior eccentric disk .",
    "the location of the azimuthally averaged longitude of pericenter @xmath166 is illustrated on the disk by the plus signs , which are almost @xmath167 apart from the dust density peak as shown in the figure .",
    "it can be easily understood by inspecting equations  ( [ dust_den_pert ] ) & ( [ eq : sigma_d ] ) .",
    "the perturbed dust density @xmath168 is approximately equal to @xmath169 ) , where @xmath170 has been neglected , as can be validated from figure [ den_8000_5 ] .",
    "since @xmath171 from figure [ fig : ecc_ep=0 ] , @xmath172 , it explains why the dust pericenters @xmath166 trace the same radial contour as @xmath173 in the first quarter of the velocity map as shown in figure [ vrd_8000_5 ] .",
    "] hence the phase difference between @xmath168 and @xmath100 is @xmath167 , implying that the density peak lies more or less at the location of the apocenter of the disk .",
    "the result can be found quite intuitive by inspecting the divergence of the dust velocity fields shown in figure [ vrd_8000_5 ] .",
    "as the dust particles move toward the apocenter ( pericenter ) , the divergence of the velocity fields is negative ( positive ) and thus the streamlines are being compressed ( rarefied ) , therefore finally reaching the maximum ( minimum ) surface density at the apocenter ( pericenter ) .",
    "we see from figure [ den_8000_5 ] that after time averaging , there still exist residual density fluctuations associated with short - period density waves , as has already been noted for figure [ fig : density_g ] in the paper .",
    "nevertheless , the residual density is small enough to reveal the density profiles corresponding to the secular @xmath0 eccentric disk .",
    "it is illustrated in figure [ fig : den_1d ] , which shows the background and perturbed density profiles along the polar direction where the time - averaged dust density @xmath168 is at its maximum .",
    "corresponding to @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively for the @xmath120 and @xmath176 cases in figure [ den_8000_5 ] , figure  [ fig : den_1d ] shows that although the residual waves are present , they are small enough for the identification of the secular value of @xmath168 from order - of - magnitude estimates . in terms of the dimensionless units ,",
    "the background dust surface density @xmath118 is about @xmath177 .",
    "figure [ fig : den_1d ] indicates that the excess / deficit of the dust density @xmath168 associated with the @xmath0 eccentric disk is about @xmath178 ( i.e. @xmath179 ) .",
    "other than the secular density perturbations of dust due to the eccentric disk , we also estimate the local density perturbations of dust due to the tightly wound gas density waves for comparison .",
    "the perturbed gas density of the spiral density waves @xmath180 is about @xmath181 from the hydrodynamical simulation . given the dust - to - gas ratio 0.01 , the perturbed dust density associated with the density waves",
    "is then given by @xmath182 , which is about the same order as the secular density perturbations of dust @xmath168 .",
    "the above 2d dust analysis does not take into account the background radial drift with the speed described by @xmath57 in equation ( [ eq : u_d2 ] ) .",
    "the importance of the radial drift can be evaluated by comparing the radial drift timescale @xmath183 to the precession time @xmath184 for @xmath120 and @xmath185 for @xmath121 . using equation ( [ eq : u_d2 ] ) with @xmath186 and @xmath187 in our isothermal model , we find that @xmath188 is about @xmath189 for 0.01 cm - sized dust particles and about 0.3 - 0.5 for 100 cm - sized particles .",
    "meter - sized particles drift inwards relatively fast at a rate almost comparable to the precession rate because the dimensionless stopping time @xmath190 for meter - sized particles @xcite in contrast to @xmath191 for 0.01 cm - sized dust particles .",
    "the values of @xmath188 imply that the particles smaller than 1 m slowly drift inwards to the adjacent eccentric orbit after a number of orbital regressions in the protoplanetary disk .      to study the dust behavior in a ",
    "transition \" disk defined simply by a disk with a low gas density , we apply @xmath192 au as the new length unit to the dimensionless simulation results presented in  4.1 .",
    "the initial gas density is then reduced to about @xmath193  g @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting disk accretion rate @xmath194 is diminished by a factor of 90 or so .",
    "the drag force is weakened accordingly due to the low gas density .",
    "hence , the spatial distribution of the dust particles with different sizes would be significantly different .",
    "the departures from the keplerian circular velocity for particles of 3 different sizes ( 0.01 , 1 , and 100 cm ) are shown in figure [ fig : vrd_8000_100_ep=0 ] for @xmath120 and in figure [ fig : vrd_4000_100_ep=0.1 ] for @xmath121 . in comparison to the results from the gas velocity map in figure [ fig : v_gas ] , particles smaller than 1 cm",
    "are still tightly coupled to the gas but meter - sized particles become weakly coupled in the transition disk .",
    "as a result , the radial velocity of the gas and that of the well - coupled dust can reach about 167 - 171 m / s around the outer edge of the gap , while the radial velocity of meter - sized particles exhibit different magnitudes ; namely , 40 - 53 m / s for @xmath120 and 145 - 152 m / s for @xmath121 at the outer edge of the gap . the larger velocity for the meter - sized particles in the @xmath121 case is due to excitation by the planet eccentricity .",
    "there exists a pronounced azimuthal phase difference in the velocities between the small and large particles .",
    "figure [ fig : den_100 ] shows the dust density distributions for the 3 different particle sizes in the transition disk .",
    "the dust density distribution is similar to that for the gas in the cases of the 0.01 cm - sized and 1 cm - sized dust particles . in both the @xmath120 and @xmath121 cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath90 in the exterior disk is about @xmath195 for the 0.01 cm - sized particles , which is 100 times smaller than that for the 1 cm - sized particles and 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that for 100 cm - sized particles .",
    "meter - sized particles are still in the epstein regime but become weakly coupled to the gas due to the low gas density ( i.e. @xmath98 ) . as a result , the spatial distribution appears to be distinctly different between small dust grains and meter - sized particles .",
    "the location of the pericenter at each annulus is denoted by the plus sign in figure [ fig : den_100 ] . as in the case for the standard disk discussed in  4.2 ,",
    "the apocenters of the transition disk are almost aligned .",
    "further , the density excess ( deficit ) resides around the apocenter ( pericenter ) of the dust . in the @xmath120 case ,",
    "the corresponding phase difference between the 1 cm- and 100 cm - sized particles is about 80@xmath196 , as shown in the left panels of figure [ fig : den_100 ] , in agreement with @xmath197 .",

    "the eccentric disk harboring a planet of 5 jupiter masses simulated by @xcite exhibited a great concentration of 1 cm - sized dust particles in the strong spiral wave just outside of the gap . in this work ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the secular evolution of dust . hence , whether these transient and resonant effects for dust trapping can also occur in an eccentric gaseous disk is not addressed .",
    "@xcite simulated eccentric circumstellar disks in binary star systems and investigated how different physical parameters affect disk evolutions .",
    "they showed that the gas eccentricity of a realistic radiative disk is smaller than that of a locally isothermal disk . as a result",
    ", the dust eccentricity is expected to be smaller than that in our results , and hence the asymmetric dust distribution in an eccentric disk would present more of a challenge for detection .    other than the aforementioned effects that are ignored , several phenomena have also been left out in this work . in reality , dust particles can settle toward the mid - plane and influence the disk gas .",
    "the efficiency of the dust settling depends also on the stopping time , which evolves with the gas disk @xcite . the resulting thin , dense disk for dust with its relative motion to the gas leads to the streaming instability , which clumps the dust @xcite .",
    "we are unable to consider in our 2d model these effects involving vertical motions . in our model , dust of various sizes",
    "are assumed to be uniformly distributed after the planet - disk system settles into a quasi - steady state .",
    "we simply assume that the dust - to - gas ratio is so small that dust motions are passively influenced by the gas motions without any feedback to the gas dynamics .",
    "another limitation of our model is that dust growth / fragmentation have not been taken into account .",
    "collisions among large particles can produce smaller particles , which have the effect of smearing out the distinct phase differences of the asymmetric features between well and weakly coupled particles .",
    "orbital crossing between strongly and weakly coupled dust particles surely enhances dust collisions and hence facilitates dust growth / fragmentation . without considering these effects ,",
    "the dust size distribution is thus not modelled in our study .",
    "nevertheless , our work focussing only on secular dynamics of dust presents a framework for future studies to explore more complicated gas - dust dynamics in an eccentric disk .",
    "having described the limitations of our analysis , our results may render a basic picture for alma ( atacama large millimeter / submillimer array ) and evla ( karl g. jansky very large array ) observations .",
    "the short - period features , such as the tightly wound density waves , probably present formidable challenges to be observationally resolved , but the secular features discussed in this study are more large - scale , comparable to the gap size , and thus more promising detection - wise .",
    "there exists a phase correlation for the @xmath0 structure between the gas velocity fields and dust density distribution in an eccentric disk with an embedded massive planet .",
    "the velocity departure from the keplerian circular motion in our model can be larger than 150 m / s , which is probably high enough for alma detectability .",
    "in addition , the maximum dust emissions should be aligned with the apocenter of the eccentric gap in an eccentric disk .",
    "we show that particles with sizes of 1 m and 1 cm may be distributed differently in the azimuthal direction of an eccentric disk with a low gas density .",
    "although large particles may be broken down into small dust particles , perhaps an attempt to measure the spectral energy distribution with evla in different azimuthal directions covering the wavelengths from 1 to tens of cm and to ascertain whether the dust sizes depend on the azimuthal angle of a transition disk with an eccentric gap is feasible .",
    "the gap of the gaseous disk for @xmath121 is slightly shallower but wider than that for @xmath120 in our model for @xmath267 .",
    "this outcome seems to be consistent with the parameter study by @xcite for smaller planetary masses @xmath268 on fixed orbits .",
    "since we are concerned with dust dynamics exterior to the gap , the gap shape does not introduce significant differences in the results between the @xmath120 and @xmath121 cases .",
    "nonetheless , it has been known from theories that in the presence of eccentricity , the planet - disk interaction does not depend only on the 3:1 eccentric lindblad resonance but may rely on other resonances @xcite . using the same code with the standard disk parameters , @xcite suggested that the planetary eccentricity enhances the torques on the gas via eccentric corotation resonances against the opposite torques from lindblad resonances and thus results in more gas in the gap .",
    "the account does not explain why the gap opened up by an eccentric planet is wider , which occurs beyond the disk radius @xmath269 - 1.3 as shown in their figure 4 and in our figure [ fig : denave_vs_ep ] . note that at @xmath270 , the 2:1 eccentric corotation resonance overlaps with the 4:2 eccentric lindblad resonance as well as the 2:1 ordinary lindblad resonance .",
    "unfortunately , one is unable to deduce sufficient information from resonant torques @xcite to determine the evolution of the system when both the disk and planet possess eccentricity @xcite . investigation following the method provided by @xcite is desirable for understanding the gap opening due to mean - motion resonances in an eccentric disk .",
    "in addition , @xcite has cautioned that it is not self - consistent to assume a fixed planetary orbit in their study .",
    "our work , based on the same assumption , is certainly plagued with the same problem .",
    "the eccentricity evolutions of the disk and the planet should be coupled @xcite , especially when the disk - to - planet mass ratio is not negligibly small @xcite . in the linear secular theory solving for eccentric modes of a coupled planet - disk system",
    ", the pericenter of the planet s orbit should not stand still as is assumed in our model but rather precess as well .",
    "the precession rate is the eigenvalue of the coupled planet - disk problem @xcite and therefore should be the same as that of the disk . a self - consistent linear calculation as well as numerical works",
    "should be conducted in the context that we have presented here .",
    "needless to say , our fiducial model for protoplanetary and transition disks only presents suggestive results for azimuthal asymmetry of dust distributions in an eccentric disk .",
    "parameter studies built on our fiducial model should be conducted to provide a more complete picture that encompasses a large variety of physical conditions for protoplanetary disks at different stages .",
