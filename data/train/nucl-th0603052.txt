    "the landau - migdal theory of _ _ finite fermi systems__@xcite is the best - founded phenomenological theory for nuclear structure calculations .",
    "it is based on landau s _ theory of interacting fermi systems _",
    "the basic formulas can be derived within the many - body green functions formalism in an exact way using landau`s renormalization procedure .",
    "this procedure give rise to renormalized residual interactions and effective single particle operators . the basic input which is required to solve the corresponding equations are the quasi particle energies , the renormalized particle - hole(ph ) interaction and effective operators .",
    "if one considers pairing - correlations also a renormalized particle - particle interactions enters .",
    "so far in most of the applications the quasi particle energies have been taken from experiment and/or single - particle models and the renormalized residual interactions have been parametrized and the corresponding parameters are fitted to data .",
    "these _ landau - migdal parameters _ turned out to be universal for all nuclei , except the lightest ones .",
    "more over some of these parameters are directly connected with gross properties of nuclei such as the compression modulus and the symmetry energy .",
    "for that reason any effective interaction , hamiltonian or lagrangian which is used for nuclear mean field calculations should be tested against specific landau- migdal parameters .",
    "this possibility was first used in 1975 by bckman , jackson and speth @xcite who showed that several parameterizations of the skyrme forces used at that time led to an instability against spin collapse and had to be modified . in ref .",
    "@xcite this method was used to design new versions of the skyrme interaction which could be used in self consistent nuclear structure calculations . in ref .",
    "@xcite the landau - migdal parameters where calculated from g - matrices based on meson exchange models .",
    "the authors showed in addition that the landau expansion of the ph - interaction is well justified for all parameters except the spin - isospin parameter g ' which is strongly momentum dependent due to the long range of the one - pion exchange .",
    "for that reason one has to include this contribution explicitly if one calculates magnetic properties @xcite",
    ". a detailed discussion of the landau migdal theory and self consistent approaches and the application of effective forces in the ffs can be found in the review by khodel and saperstein @xcite .",
    "fully self consistent calculations in the landau - migdal approach have been also performed by fayans et al .",
    "@xcite who based their mean field and the residual interactions on _ local energy - density functionals_. chiral lagrangians",
    "@xcite seems to be especially appropriate for self consistent nuclear structure calculations within the landau - migdal approach because they have a similar structure as the generalized landau - migdal interaction ( which includes the one pion exchange contribution @xcite ) .",
    "they have strong short range components and the one pion exchange is included explicitly .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this structure of the bare interaction does not change if one performs a partial summation to obtain the brueckner g - matrix .",
    "the inclusion of the one pion exchange in chiral lagrangians is the basic difference to skyrme type hamiltonians which are commonly used in self consistent nuclear structure calculations .",
    "this ansatz is a parametrization of a g - matrix and includes zero - range and derivatives of zero range components only .",
    "the zero range three body part can be replaced by a density dependent two - body interaction which simulates the density dependence of the interaction in nuclei . in the case of chiral lagrangian",
    "the density dependence is introduced by the g - matrix and more over it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the chiral expansion also give rise to a strong three body force if applied to the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "it is important to mention that the single particle spectrum calculated in a mean field approach can not be directly compared with the experimental spectrum and can therefore not be identified with landaus quasi particles because the coupling to phonons modifies the theoretical spectrum .",
    "for that reason , as we will show , the mean - field spectra are the appropriate input for the _ extended theory of finite fermi systems _",
    "@xcite , which includes in a consistent way the phonon contributions .",
    "landau s theory of interacting fermi systems @xcite deals with weakly excited states in infinite systems of interacting fermions , such as @xmath1he or nuclear matter . without the interaction the system would be simply a collection of independent fermions , each characterized by its momentum @xmath2 and by its spin .",
    "the particles obey the fermi - dirac statistics and therefore occupy all quantum states up to the fermi momentum @xmath3 ; all the states with larger momenta are unoccupied .",
    "the occupied states form a sphere of radius @xmath3 , which is called the _",
    "fermi sphere_. the fermi momentum is proportional to the number of particles    @xmath4    excited states are formed by moving particles from the interior to the exterior of the fermi sphere . therefore excited states differ from the ground state by a number of particle - hole pairs , the particles with @xmath5 and the holes with @xmath6 .",
    "these particles and holes play the role of elementary excitations in the _ ideal fermi gas_. they appear and disappear only in pairs and they have momenta close to @xmath3 for weakly excited states .",
    "the basic assumption by landau is that interacting systems may be obtained from non - interacting systems by an adiabatic switching on of the interaction . in particular",
    ", he assumes a one - to - one correspondence between the single - particle states of the non - interacting system and the so - called quasi - particle states in the interacting system .",
    "these quasi - particles behave in the correlated system like real particles in the non - interacting system : they obey the fermi - dirac statistics and therefore occupy the corresponding quasi - particle states up to the fermi momentum which can be calculated from the same formula ( eq.([eq:1 ] ) ) . as in the non - interacting system ,",
    "the excitations in the correlated system are ( quasi-)particles with momenta greater than @xmath3 and ( quasi-)holes with momenta less than @xmath3 that appear and disappear , again in pairs .",
    "quasi - particles are only defined near the fermi surface , where their decay width is much smaller then their excitation energy . in order to define such quasi - particles landau made the following assumption concerning the interaction of the quasi - particles : the interaction follows from a self - consistent field that acts on one specific quasi - particle and which is produced by all the other quasi - particles .",
    "for that reason the energy of the system is no longer the sum of the separate quasi - particle energies , but is a functional of the occupation function @xmath7 of the quasi - particle state @xmath2 . if one excites the system one basically changes the occupation functions @xmath7 by an amount @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding change of the energy is @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the equilibrium energies of the quasi - particles .",
    "we rewrite this expression as @xmath11}\\delta n(\\bi{p } ) =   \\int{d\\bi{p}\\ \\epsilon(\\bi{p})\\delta n(\\bi{p})}\\ ] ] the natural definition of the energy of an individual quasi - particle is therefore the first variational derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation function and that of the interaction between the quasi - particles is the second functional derivative @xmath12 in @xmath1he the interaction @xmath13 has a spin - independent and a spin - dependent part .",
    "@xmath14 the energies of the elementary excitations are measured from the fermi sphere . for quasi - particles one",
    "obtains @xmath15 and for quasi - holes @xmath16 the velocity of the excitations at the fermi surface is given by @xmath17 as we shall see later the effective mass @xmath18 is directly connected with @xmath13 .",
    "if one considers excitations near the fermi surface one may restrict the magnitude of the momenta @xmath2 and @xmath19 in the interaction @xmath20 to the fermi momentum .",
    "the only variable then is the angle @xmath21 between the two momenta .",
    "this suggests an expansion in legendre polynomials @xmath22 the constants @xmath23 are the famous landau parameters .",
    "one introduces dimensionless parameters by defining @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the inverse density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "likewise , one may also expand the other component of the interaction in eq.([eq:5 ] ) and define the parameter @xmath26 in the same way .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related to the compression modulus @xmath29 by @xmath30 and the effective mass @xmath18 @xmath31 the interacting quasi - particles and quasi - holes in @xmath32he give rise to the famous zero sound and spin waves .",
    "the corresponding linearized time dependent equation for @xmath8 is equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) equation ; it is the basis of the landau- migdal theory .",
    "migdal has applied landau s _ theory of interacting fermi system _ to atomic nuclei @xcite . here one deals with two kinds of fermions _protons and neutrons_ and , more importantly , with a relatively small number of particles .",
    "in the past 40 years migdal s theory has been successfully applied to numerous nuclear structure problems .",
    "whereas in infinite systems the quasi - particles differ from the bare particles only by their effective mass , the situation in finite nuclei is completely different . here",
    "the quasi - particles are the single particle excitations of the nuclei , which can be obtained from phenomenological shell models or , in the case of self consistent approaches , by the corresponding mean - field solutions of a given effective lagrangian , effective hamiltonian and energy density functionals , respectively .",
    "the quasi - particle interaction is defined in the same way as before .",
    "the interaction , however , depends not only on the spin but also on the isospin of the quasi - particles and is density dependent because the interaction inside a nucleus is very different from the interaction in free space . as in infinite systems",
    ", one expands the interaction at the fermi surface in terms of legendre polynomials and the parameters of the expansion the famous _ landau - migdal parameters_ are determined from experiment .",
    "these parameters turn out to be universal for all nuclei but the very light ones .    as pointed out in the introduction , the _ theory of finite fermi systems ( tffs ) _ is a semi - phenomenological microscopic theory .",
    "it is microscopic because all its equations are derived rigorously from first principles , however it contains also phenomenological aspects , such as the quasi - particle energies and wave functions and the quasi - particle  quasi - hole interaction .",
    "all these quantities are defined microscopically and could , in principle , be calculated starting from the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "such calculations are very involved and in actual calculations one has to make severe approximations , so that we can not expect to obtain quantitative agreement between , for example , the calculated and phenomenological landau - migdal parameters .",
    "nevertheless the calculated landau - migdal parameters are in surprisingly good agreement with the phenomenological ones @xcite . in the tffs , as in landau s theory , one derives a renormalized equation for the response functions and solves this equation in a given approximation . for that reason the tffs can be applied to such problems as are connected with the response function .",
    "these include , for example , excitation energies and transition probabilities in even nuclei and moments and transitions in odd - mass nuclei .",
    "the input data . single particle energies and wave functions",
    "are supposed to be given by a shell model in the phenomenological approach , or are calculated in mean field approximation in self consistent calculations .",
    "similarly the residual particle - hole and particle -particle interactions are either parametrized and adjusted to the experiment or determined from the corresponding effective lagrangian and effective hamiltonian , respectively . in this respect",
    "is the tffs and its extension ( which includes phonons explicitly ) a frame for any nuclear structure calculations , for self consistent and non self consistent ones .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the following chapters .      in this section",
    "we will give a short introduction to the theory of many - body green functions .",
    "( more details are given in @xcite ) .",
    "they are the basis of the tffs .",
    "the starting point of the theory is a hamiltonian for fermions @xmath33 here @xmath34 are single particle energies , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 are creation and annihilation operators of nucleons in the state @xmath37 , which obey anticommutation rules , and _ w _ is the residual two - body interaction .",
    "we now consider an @xmath38-particle system @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are assumed to be the exact solutions of the many - body schrdinger equation with a given many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the one - particle and two - particle green functions are defined as @xmath42 @xmath43 with the time - dependent creation and annihilation operators @xmath44 the symbol @xmath45 denotes the time - ordering operator of wick , which means that the operators should be taken in time - ordered form with the latest time to the left and the earliest to the right .",
    "in addition , the product has to be multiplied by a factor @xmath46 depending on whether an even or odd number of permutations is needed to come from the given to the time - ordered form .",
    "the fourier transform of the one - particle green function has the form @xmath47 correspondingly , the two - particle green function depends on three frequencies .",
    "for further investigation it is convenient to introduce green functions with a source field @xmath48 @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the short hand notation : @xmath51    in order to determine the green functions one needs the equations of motion",
    ". they can be obtained by differentiation of the corresponding green function with respect to time . for the one - particle green function with a source field",
    "we obtain @xmath52 with the abbreviations @xmath53 here we have used eq.([eq:14 ] ) in order to eliminate the hamiltonian @xmath54 in eq.([eq:22 ] ) . the equation for the two - body green function",
    "is connected with the three - body green function and so forth .",
    "thereby one obtains a hierarchy of equations . in order to calculate the one - body green functions one needs the two - body green function , etc",
    "this is not the way that we proceed in the following ; rather , we replace the bare two - body interaction @xmath55 by an effective one - body potential @xmath56 ( _ mass operator or self - energy _ ) which , in principle , is given by the bare interaction and the two - particle green function .",
    "the corresponding equation for the one - particle green function is called the dyson equation .",
    "@xmath57 so far we have only replaced the unknown two - particle green function by the also unknown self - energy @xmath56 and little seems to be gained . before we discuss the solution of this problem we continue with the development of the formal theory .",
    "we define the response function @xmath58 by the functional derivative of the one - particle green function @xmath59 the functional derivative of the dyson equation gives an integral equation for the response function @xmath60 where we introduced the effective two - body interaction @xmath29 via @xmath61     graphical representation of the bethe - salpeter equation for the response function in the ph channel.,width=453 ]    a graphical representation of eq.([eq:26 ] ) is given in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "one notices that the kernel @xmath29 of the integral equation is irreducible with respect to the particle - hole propagator .",
    "we further introduce the vertex function @xmath62 by @xmath63 the corresponding equation follows from eq.([eq:26 ] ) @xmath64 the linear response function allows one to determine the following quantities :    a.   from eq.([eq:25 ] ) we obtain in linear approximation the change of the one - particle green function : @xmath65 the fourier transformation of the time variables gives @xmath66 and , after integration over @xmath67 , one obtains @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the energy transferred by the external field @xmath70 and @xmath68 is the change of the density due to this external field in a given single particle basis @xmath71 : @xmath72 b.   with the time order @xmath73 , we insert into the two particle green function a complete system of eigenfunctions of the a - particle system between the two particle - hole pairs @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 as the response function is defined as @xmath77 its spectral representation is also given by eq.([eq:32 ] ) but the sum begins at @xmath78 . with the appropriate time order one obtains from the generalized green function in eq.([eq:34 ] ) the transition amplitudes between the ground state and the excited states of the a - particle system .",
    "c.   with the time order @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the two particle green function one can move these operators to left and right side of the time ordering and may introduce two complete sets of eigenstates of the ( a+1)- system or ( a-1)-system , respectively . from this one",
    "obtains another generalized green function @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are two given states in the odd mass system . as we know only the response function , one has to subtract the one - particle green function of the a - particle system and obtains finally the change of the density between two given states in the ( @xmath84)-system and the ground state of the a - particle system . with this quantity",
    "one can calculate moments and transitions in odd - mass nuclei .",
    "details are given in @xcite .      in order to solve the equation for the response function and vertex function , respectively",

    "however , the theoretical width is much too small and the maximum of the cross section is much too high because the spreading width , which is due to the fragmentation of the single particle strength , is not considered .",
    "the same is true for the other two cases if one compares the theoretical results with neighboring nuclei data exist . in the next section",
    "we will discuss an extension of the tffs , where the low lying collective phonons are coupled to the single particle states , which gives rise to a fragmentation of the single particle strength . in this way",
    "we include , as we will show , a major part of the spreading width .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the original tffs allows one to calculate only the centroid energies and total transition strength of giant resonances because the approach is restricted to 1p1h configurations . in order to describe nuclear structure properties in more detail one",
    "has to include 2p2h , or even more complex configurations . a theoretical approach that takes into account the complete 2p2h configuration space and",
    "a realistic 2p2h interaction is numerically intractable if one uses a realistically large configuration space .",
    "for this reason the main approximation in the etffs concerns the selection of the most important 2p2h configurations .",
    "one knows from experiments , e.g. from the neighboring odd mass nuclei of @xmath156pb , that the coupling of low - lying collective phonons to the single particle states gives rise to a fragmentation of the single - particle strength , which is seen in even - even nuclei as a spreading width in the giant resonances . in the past 15 years",
    "an extension of the tffs that includes , in a consistent microscopic way , the most collective low - lying phonons has been performed by tselyaev @xcite and kamerdzhiev , speth and tertychny @xcite ( and references therein ) . in this way",
    "one considers a special class of 2p2h configurations because the phonons are calculated within the conventional ( 1p1h ) tffs .",
    "the phonons give rise to a modification of the particle and hole propagators , the ph - interaction and the ground state correlations .",
    "the extension that includes uncorrelated 2p2h configurations is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .      in landau s theory",
    "the self energy @xmath56 is irreducible in the one - particle and one - hole channels , respectively , and the kernel @xmath29 in the integral equation for the response function ( see fig.([fig:1 ] ) ) is irreducible in the particle - hole channel .",
    "one introduces now a hierarchy of energy dependencies : as one can see from eq.([eq:53 ] ) the particle - hole propagator introduces a strong dependence in the energy transfer @xmath69 .",
    "compared to this singular behavior one neglects in landau s theory the energy dependence in the ph - interaction .",
    "one neglects consistently the energy dependence of the self - energy @xmath56 in the dyson equation ( eq.([eq:33 ] ) and considers the quasi - particle and quasi - hole poles only .",
    "this approach is of leading order in the energy transfer @xmath69 . in the extended theory , where phonons are introduced ,",
    "one considers the next - to - leading order in the energy transfer ; i.e. , the self energy and the ph - interaction become energy dependent .",

    "the wavy lines and the thin lines denote the phonons and the single particle propagators , respectively.,width=453 ]    first we discuss the so - called @xmath182 approximation @xcite , which is graphically shown in fig.([fig:4 ] ) .",
    "the upper part of graph ( b ) gives a correction to the dyson equation for quasi - particles , which now has the form @xmath183g_{\\nu_1}^{ext}(\\epsilon ) = 1\\ ] ] here @xmath184 is the one - quasi - particle green function in the extended theory and the vertex @xmath185 , which couples the quasi - particle state @xmath186 to the core excited configuration @xmath187 , is given by @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the rpa wave function of the phonon considered .",
    "the corresponding energy - dependent correction for the ph - interaction has the form @xmath190 this model has been applied , for example , to m1-resonances in closed shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "this approximation has , in general , problems with the so - called second order poles , which give rise to a distortion of the strength function near these poles .",
    "for this reason the model has been extended in several steps : ( i ) summation of the @xmath182 terms @xcite and ( ii ) partial summation of diagrams @xcite , which is call @xmath191 . in the latter case all @xmath192 contributions are consistently included and all more complex configurations are excluded as long as one neglects ground - state correlations .",
    "the actual formulas , however , include the ground state correlations completely . in the present approach , like in @xcite two types of ground state correlations",
    "are included : the conventional rpa ground state correlations , which affect the location and the magnitude of the residua of the ph propagator only , and the new type of ground state correlations , which is caused by the phonons .",
    "these correlations are qualitatively different from the conventional rpa correlations because they create new poles in the propagator , which then cause transitions between the @xmath192 in the ground state and the excited states .",
    "they give rise to a qualitative change of the strength distribution and a change in the sum rules for the moments of the strength function . as in the tffs , the energy dependence of the generalized propagator",
    "@xmath193 is much stronger than that of the generalized ph interaction , as the next - to - leading order energy dependence is removed from the interaction and explicitly taken into account in the generalized propagator .",
    "therefore one considers explicitly only the energy dependence of the propagator and neglects the energy dependence of the ph interaction .",
    "the interaction is parametrized as before ; the corresponding parameters may differ from the previous ones .",
    "the final equation for the change of the quasi - particle density in an external field has the identical form to that in the tffs ( eq.([eq:66 ] ) @xmath194 the analytical form of the generalized propagator can be found in ref.@xcite .      as in the case of the tffs the numerical input to the etffs are two sets of phenomenological parameters that describe ( i ) the woods - saxon single particle potential and ( ii ) the effective ph interaction .",
    "if one includes phonons , the problem of double counting appears in the two input data sets .",
    "one therefore has to subtract explicitly the phonon contribution from the mean field solutions as well as the ph interaction . in order to obtain the new _ refined _",
    "single particle basis @xmath195 one has to solve the equation @xmath196 where the second term on the right side is graphically given by the upper part of graph ( b ) in fig.([fig:4 ] ) .",
    "as the wave functions are only little changed , we restrict the refinement to the single particle energies . in fig.([fig:3 ] ) we also show the etffs - results for @xmath197ca , @xmath155sn and @xmath156pb .",
    "the effect of the phonon coupling is very clearly demonstrated in all three cases .",
    "the phonon coupling reduces the maximum of the strength distribution and shifts part of the strength to higher energies .",
    "this effect increases the width of the resonances and creates the long tails , which are seen in the data . for @xmath198 the theoretical mean",
    "energy has the value @xmath199 compared with experimental value @xmath200 and the theoretical width @xmath201 compared to @xmath202 . for the energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr )",
    "is only little changed in the range between 5 - 30 mev . for @xmath197ca",
    "holds : @xmath203 compared to @xmath204 and @xmath205 compared to @xmath206 .",
    "the phonon coupling improves the crpa results by a factor of two .",
    "the renewed interest in nuclear structure physics comes from newly built and planned experimental facilities that will give new information on nuclei far from stability .",
    "one of the main reasons for this is its application to astrophysics . here ,",
    "for example , one would like to know the compression modulus and the symmetry energy of neutron rich nuclei .",
    "such experiments will be performed in so - called inverse kinematics ; i.e. the radioactive isotopes will be accelerated and will be scattered from proton , deuteron or alpha particle targets",
    ". the analysis of such experiments will be very complicated as the breathing mode and giant electric dipole resonance are expected to be broad and because various multipole resonances overlap each other . for that reason on needs realistic strength distributions and energy dependent microscopic transition densities as input into the scattering codes in order to be able to extract reliable physical results . in the following",
    "we demonstrate this in the analysis of @xmath207 cross sections in @xmath208ni , where the isoscalar breathing mode has been investigated .",
    "cross sections of @xmath208ni@xmath207 at @xmath209 . at this angle",
    "the cross section is dominated by the isoscalar monopole resonance.,width=340 ]    a general problem in nuclei with @xmath210 90 is that the isoscalar monopole resonance is very broad and no longer concentrated in one single peak . in deformed nuclei ( such as one expects for nuclei far from stability ) the giant resonances are split due the deformation , which gives rise to additional complications @xcite . in lighter nuclei",
    "the role of the surface becomes more important than in the heavier ones and , in addition , @xmath207 experiments are most sensitive to the nuclear surface .",
    "for these reasons the correct treatment of the surface in those nuclei is crucial .",
    "all this has to be considered if one develops models for giant resonances in light and medium mass nuclei for which the conventional rpa approach is extended to include surface modes and the single - particle continuum . compared to this extension of the configuration space , the way that one determines the mean field and the residual interactions is of less importance . when the present example was first published",
    "the experimental situation in @xmath208ni was rather unclear .",
    "in the original analysis of the @xmath207 data @xmath211 only 32% of the ewsr was observed .",
    "the authors used standard data analysis techniques with the same phenomenological transition densities for the whole energy range . for comparison the same type of experiment in @xmath154 ca and a similar analysis by the same authors showed @xmath212 % of the ewsr @xcite . with an improved but still conventional analysis",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite obtained about 50 percent .",
    "such differences might have serious consequences for nuclear matter compressibility and its application to astrophysics . in what follows",
    "we discuss an analysis of the @xmath207 experiments in @xmath208ni , where the isoscalar giant resonance has been analyzed using the results of etffs calculations . within this model",
    "the authors calculated the distribution of the transition strengths of the isoscalar e0-e4 resonances and the corresponding energy dependent transition densities .",
    "using these transition densities one obtains , in the standard way , @xmath207 scattering cross sections that were compared with the data in the energy range between 5 - 35 mev @xcite .",
    "one of the problems that occurs in such analysis is the subtraction of the _ instrumental _ background .",
    "usually the experimentalists draw a straight line between the beginning and end of the resonance peak , where the strength distributions become flat .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref.@xcite that if one adds up the contributions of the various _ weak _ multipole contributions one also obtains a flat back ground , which may erroneously be interpreted as part of the _ instrumental _ background .",
    "cross sections of @xmath208ni@xmath207 at @xmath213 . at this angle",
    "the cross section is dominated by the isoscalar quadrupole resonance , width=340 ]    this _ background _ includes also a fraction of the _ resonance _ strength that one wishes to extract . in fig.([fig:5 ] ) the differential @xmath207 cross section for the scattering angle @xmath214 is shown , where the e0 contribution dominates the cross section . the full theoretical result ( full line with dotes)@xcite is compared with the experimental cross section @xcite .",
    "these data where obtained by subtracting an _ instrumental _ back ground denoted by `` backgr(2000 ) '' from the original experimental spectrum .",
    "the theoretical cross section is the sum of five different multipole resonances , of which the e0 and e2 contributions are shown explicitly .",
    "the straight line in the lower part of the figure , denoted by `` backgr.(1996 ) '' corresponds to the analysis of ref.@xcite , where the energy interval was smaller ( 12 - 25 mev ) . in this analysis only 32% of the ewsr e0",
    "was found , whereas the present theory predicts 71.4% of the e0 ewsr in this regime .",
    "if one considers the larger 12 - 35 mev interval , the theoretical strength exhaust 89.6% .",
    "we also show data taken at @xmath215 , where the e0 resonance has a minimum and the e2 its maximum .",
    "the same analysis as before was performed by ref.@xcite and the result is shown in fig.([fig:6 ] ) . here",
    "the e2 strength dominates the cross section whereas the breathing mode contributes only a tiny fraction .",
    "the _ other _ isoscalar modes again give an important contribution to the cross section .",
    "as both experimental cross sections are well - reproduced within the etffs analysis one may conclude that the major part of the e0 and e2 ewsr strength is in the energy range considered .",
    "one may also conclude that realistic microscopic nuclear structure models are necessary for the analysis of experiments in the giant resonance region .",
    "the models have to go beyond 1p1h rpa and must include the coupling to low - lying phonons in order to reproduce the width of giant resonances in a realistic manner .",
    "we have reviewed migdal s _ theory of finite fermi systems _ ( tffs ) and the _ extended theory of finite fermi systems _ ( etffs ) as well as their application to nuclear structure .",
    "both approaches are derived within the green function formalism , which enables one to obtain the final equations without approximations .",
    "for that reason one can apply conservations laws , which restrict the number of parameters in the actual numerical application .",
    "the tffs and the etffs are frameworks that require single - particle energies , single - particle wave functions and the ph interactions as input",
    ". the single particle basis may be obtained from phenomenological single - particle models , as discuss here , or from self consistent mean field calculations . the original landau migdal ph - interaction includes delta functions and derivatives of delta functions in @xmath216 -space , so that skyrme forces can be directly connected with the landau migdal interaction @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this fact can be used as a test for the various versions of the skyrme parameters but also for designing new set of parameters which are especially appropriate for self consistent nuclear structure calculations .",
    "the original landau migdal theory is formally identical with the 1p-1h rpa .",
    "therefore if one calculates in this approach giant multipole resonances one can only reproduce the mean energy and the total strength of those states . for a quantitative description",
    "an extension of the theory is necessary .",
    "one has to include in a consistent way the effects of the phonons .",
    "this has been done in the _ extended theory of finite fermi systems _ which we also reviewed here .",
    "we have pointed out that if one uses experimental single - particle energies and/or a correspondingly adjusted single particle model in the etffs , one has to correct for the phonon contributions in the single particle spectrum as the phonons ( or , in general , 2p2h configurations ) give rise to a compression of the single particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore a self consistent mean field approach provides the correct input data because in this case the phonon contributions are not included . for",
    "the same reason is the conventional rpa not the appropriate approximation in self consistent calculations because the uncorrelated ph spectrum is in general too wide as a consequence of the phonon contribution being missing . in the case of very collective resonances , which are strongly shifted in energy ,",
    "this deficiency can be removed by an appropriate ph interaction . w e are aware of the fact that , e.g. for a specific skyrme parametrization the residual interaction is defined by the skyrme interaction itself and one has , in principle , no freedom .",
    "but we are also aware of the fact that there exist dozens of different parameter sets that give similar ground state properties but quite different nuclear structure results @xcite .",
    "moreover , the size of the configuration space can also be chosen in an appropriate way .",
    "thus the arbitrariness in self - consistent calculations lies in the choice of the effective lagrangian , effective hamiltonian or energy - density functional and the size of the configuration space . for less collective states , such as the pygmy resonances , the energies of which are only little shifted by the residual interaction , self consistent calculations in general have difficulties reproducing simultaneously these experimental data and the giant electric dipole resonance .",
    "therefore some authors , e.g.@xcite , @xmath217 the too large level spacing by multiplying it _ adhoc _ with the corresponding effective mass in order to fit the data .",
    "this may be justified by the energy dependence of the effective mass but it certainly destroys the self consistent treatment .",
    "we have also mentioned that for magnetic properties one has to consider in the spin - isospin channel the one pion exchange explicitly .",
    "for that reason self consistent calculations , starting from chiral lagrangian may be the more consistent approach compared to the skyrme hamiltonian .",
    "acknowledgments : we thank john durso , ulf meiner and victor tselyaev for carefully reading the manuscript and many useful comments .",
    "we also appreciate the continuous collaboration with sergej kamerdzhiev and gennady tertychny in this field . the work was supported in part by the dfg grant no .",
    "gz:436rus113/806/0 - 1 .",
    "as the final equations of the landau - migdal theory are derived without approximations , one can apply conservations laws in order to restrict the number of free parameters . here",
    "we show , using local gauge invariance , that scalar vertices are not renormalized , i.e. one has to use the bare charges ( for protons and neutrons ) for the electric multipole operators .",
    "we start with the one - particle green function : @xmath218 where x and y denote four - vectors . the gauge transformation of the @xmath219-operators where @xmath48 is the charge @xmath220 leads to the following change in the hamiltonian @xmath221 here @xmath222 is the four - current of neutrons and protons",
    ". this field does not give rise to any physical changes .",
    "if one expands the transformed operators in the one - particle green function up to first order , one obtains @xmath223 the inverse of this equation has the form @xmath224 on the other hand one can calculate the change of the green function due to the additional term in the hamiltonian eq.([eq:90 ] ) with help of the linear response function @xmath225 the corresponding inverse change of the green function is given as : @xmath226 with the field : @xmath227 one obtains from eq.([eq:92 ] ) and eq.([eq:94 ] ) @xmath228 this equation has in the single particle basis @xmath229 the form : @xmath230)\\left|{\\nu _ 2 } \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle { \\nu _ 1}\\right|\\widetilde{\\tau } ( \\omega , \\omega ; \\left [ ( \\bi jk ) { e^{i \\bi k \\bi r}}\\right])\\left|{\\nu _ 2 } \\right\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath231)\\left|{\\nu _ 2 } \\right\\rangle = \\sum _ { \\nu _ 3 \\nu _ 4 } \\widetilde{\\tau } _ { \\nu _ 1 \\nu _ 3 \\nu _ 2 \\nu _ 4}(\\omega , \\omega ) \\left[q e^{i\\left(\\bi{kr}\\right)}\\right]_{\\nu_4\\nu_3}\\ ] ] and @xmath232)\\left|{\\nu _ 2 } \\right\\rangle = \\sum _ { \\nu _ 3 \\nu _ 4 } \\widetilde{\\tau } _ { \\nu _ 1 \\nu _ 3 \\nu _ 2 \\nu _ 4}(\\omega , \\omega ) \\left[(\\bi jk ) e^{i\\left(\\bi{kr}\\right)}\\right]_{\\nu_4\\nu_3}\\ ] ] we have replaced in eq.([eq:97 ] ) the charge distribution @xmath145 by the point charge @xmath48 . with the singular part of the one particle green function eq.([eq:53 ] )",

    "if one puts the renormalized vertex function ( eq.([eq:102 ] ) ) explicitly into eq.([eq:101 ] ) @xmath238 and considers the limit @xmath239 .",
