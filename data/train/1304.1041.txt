    "the density of a solar system body is one of the most important parameters for understanding the composition , evolution , and formation history of the object . in the kuiper belt , the wide range of densities , from below that of water ice to that of nearly pure rock , is one of the mysteries that continues to have no satisfactory explanation .",
    "@xcite proposed several classes of general solutions to explain , in particular , the wide range of densities of objects in the dwarf planet size range . in one limiting scenario ,",
    "densities gradual increase with size as small amounts of ice are removed with each accretional impact . in the other limit , the densities of the largest objects are stochastically set by single giant impacts which can remove significant quantities of ice and lead to one or more satellites with a small fraction of the mass of the primary .",
    "the density of makemake could be a key discriminator between these types of models .",
    "makemake is the largest known kuiper belt object for which no satellite has been detected @xcite . in that case , makemake might never have suffered a density - increasing giant impact , and thus could have a density lower than the typical values of @xmath62.1 g @xmath7 and higher that appear typical for dwarf planets with small satellites .",
    "in contrast , a density @xmath8 g @xmath7 for makemake would indicate the correlation between high densities and the presence of collisional satellites is a mere coincidence unrelated to formation .",
    "* hereafter o12 ) measured a stellar occultation of makemake and , from these data , infer a density of 1.7@xmath10.3 g @xmath7 for the object .",
    "such a density would strongly support the classes of models in which the high densities of objects like haumea and eris are due to single giant impacts which left small moons in orbit .",
    "because of the importance of this density for constraining the formation pathways of these icy dwarf planets , we investigate this density measurement to determine its robustness . to do so we reanalyze the occultation data of o12 using a quantitative , rather than qualitative , statistical framework .",
    "in addition to examining the density , this new analysis allows us to obtain statistically justifiable constraints on the size , shape , and albedo of makemake for the first time .",
    "makemake occulted the star nomad 1181 - 0235723 on 23 april 2011 .",
    "o12 report 8 detections of the occultation from stations in chile and brazil , and they fit square - well occultation models to determine the time of stellar disappearance and reappearance for each station , as well as uncertainties .",
    "the data quality are exquisite , with event uncertainties as small as 0.04 seconds in the best case , corresponding to chord lengths with uncertainities of only a few kilometers . as seen in fig .",
    "1 , however , one difficulty with the data is that 5 of the 8 chords sample nearly the same region on makemake and the three remaining stations sample identical chords 300 km south ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the lack of strong constraint on the north - south dimension dominates the shape results of o12 .    to determine the shape and density of makemake , o12 first fit",
    "the data using simple @xmath9 minimization and then present a series of qualitative arguments based on additional consideration to modify the results given by the data .",
    "such an approach need not remain qualitative but can be given statistical meaning by adopting a bayesian approach .",
    "we develop such an approach here .    to check for consistency with o12 , we first attempt to reproduce their basic results and determine the best - fit model to describe the data assuming",
    "that makemake is perfectly spherical . in this case",
    "we fit three parameters : the sphere diameter , @xmath10 , and the @xmath11 and @xmath12 offset of the shadow of makemake from the center of the predicted path . in our analysis",
    "we calculate predicted disappearance and appearance times at each station given values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , and we compute the likelihood , which is identical to the value of @xmath9 as described in o12 , for those parameters .",
    "to compute the bayesian probability function , we multiply the likelihood by the priors on all of the parameters . to begin , we assume simple uniform priors in @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 for best comparison to o12 .    to determine the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for each of the parameters , we integrate through phase space using a markhov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) scheme .",
    "we use the python package _ emcee _",
    "@xcite which implements the @xcite affine invariant ensemble sampler for mcmc . for our simple spherical fit ,",
    "we found good convergence using an ensemble of 100 chains running 10@xmath13 steps with a initialization ( `` burn - in '' ) period , which is discarded , of 10% of the total length of each chain .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 offsets of the star are of no interest , so we treat them as nuisance parameters and marginalize over their distributions .",
    "the distribution of @xmath10  that is , the pdf marginalized over the other two parameters  is nearly gaussian , and we find that the spherical diameter is @xmath14 km . throughout this paper",
    "we define the best fit as the peak of the pdf and the 1@xmath0 range as the smallest region about the best fit containing 68.2% of the probability . if the peak of the pdf is at or near one of the extrema we report an upper or lower limit with the same method .",
    "the modest improvement in the uncertainty from the o12 result of @xmath15 km is the result of the marginalization and is a small demonstration of the usefulness of this technique .",
    "as correctly pointed out by o12 , given plausible densities and the measured 7.77 hour spin period of makemake @xcite , the true shape of makemake will not be a sphere , but rather a maclaurin spheroid with an elongation dependent on the density and spin rate @xcite .",
    "such a spheroid , viewed in projection , will appear as an ellipse .",
    "o12 fit directly to an elliptical shape and find , not surprisingly , that their best - fit ellipse is elongated in the north - south direction , with an axial ratio of 1.15@xmath10.17 .",
    "they then argue that a true elongation in the north - south direction would be coincidental and that the real elongation is probably smaller .",
    "qualitative arguments are given to suggest a `` preferred '' elongation of 1.05@xmath10.03 , though the reasons for these precise values are unclear .",
    "these arguments can be approached statistically rather than qualitatively .",
    "rather than fit an ellipse to the projected shape of the body , we fit to the full maclaurin spheroid shape .",
    "we parameterize this shape with four parameters , @xmath16 , the ratio of the equatorial diameter to the polar diameter , @xmath10 , the polar diameter , @xmath17 , the angle of the pole with respect to the line - of - sight ( which we call the `` polar axis angle '' ) , and , @xmath18 , the position angle of the largest dimension of the projected ellipse ( the `` azimuthal angle '' ) .",
    "such a fit has many degeneracies ; these degeneracies , rather than being a problem , correctly account for the volume of phase space in the multi - dimensional fit and give a correct accounting of the probabilities of each of these parameters .    in our ellipsoid fit ,",
    "we constrain the ratio of the polar to equatorial diameters to be between 1 and 1.716 , the minimum and maximum values obtainable by a maclaurin spheroid @xcite ( we add additional constraints on the shape below ) .",
    "we add no constraints on the azimuth angle , and we chose @xmath17 such that the polar axis is oriented arbitrarily in space ( we also modify this constraint below ) . because of the much larger phase space to be explored , we run our mcmc sampler with an ensemble of 100 chains sampled through @xmath19 iterations .",
    "we find that the pdf of the elongation , @xmath16 , is not highly constrained .",
    "the pdf for @xmath16 peaks at @xmath20 and decreases to 20% of the peak value by 1.716 .",
    "the 1@xmath0 upper limit on the true elongation is 1.37 .",
    "the projected elongation , is , however , more tightly constrained .",
    "the pdf peaks at 1.0 and has a 1@xmath0 upper limit of of only 1.09 ( figure 2 ) . simply by correctly using our prior knowledge that we are looking at a two - dimensional projection of an arbitrarily oriented maclaurin spheroid",
    ", this analysis provides a three times tighter constraint on the measured projected elongation than the o12 1@xmath0 upper limit of 1.32 .",
    "our pdf for @xmath17 is not as would be expected for a random orientation , but rather has a peak and 1@xmath0 range of @xmath21 .",
    "these results correctly take into account both the constraints from the data and the geometric expectations of a randomly oriented projected ellipse .",
    "knowing that the maclaurin spheroid can have a wide range of values for @xmath16 between 1 and 1.716 , the pole position must be close to the line - of - sight or else a larger projected elongation would be measured , _ or _",
    "the elongation must be close to the north - south direction where the elongation is unconstrained .",
    "but , because the volume of parameter space is low in the unconstrained direction , the overall likelihood of this orientation and thus these large elongations is small .",
    "figure 3 illustrates this effect by showing probability contours of elongation azimuth vs. projected elongation .",
    "we now add prior constraints to help us determine the projected shape .",
    "we first use the combined spitzer and herschel radiometry which suggests that the projected area of makemake is 1420@xmath160 km .",
    "this prior mainly serves to limit very large elongations in the north - south direction which would cause the thermal emission to be higher than observed .",
    "a more important prior is on the density . while above , we allowed @xmath16 to range between 1 and 1.716  essentially choosing a uniform prior for the elongation  a more physically motivated approach is to use a prior on the density itself , rather than the elongation , and allow the density and rotation period to determine the elongation .",
    "o12 claim that their occultation results provide a measurement of the density of makemake of 1.7@xmath10.3 g @xmath7 . the primary justification for the assumption of a density of 1.7@xmath10.3",
    "g @xmath7 is that for higher densities , the volatile retention models of @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* updated in ) predict retention of n@xmath22 for a body of the size and temperature of makemake , which would then result in a measurable atmosphere in the o12 occultation data .",
    "this statement is , however , a gross misinterpretation of the volatile retention models . in the models of @xcite , we explicitly and deliberately calculate the _",
    "slowest _ possible volatile loss mechanism ",
    "jeans escape  so that objects that would lose all of their volatiles due to this mechanism must have lost all of their accessible volatiles .",
    "but it is incorrect to say that objects which could have retained volatiles against jeans escape must have retained them against all other mechanisms .",
    "haumea is an excellent example .",
    "based on its size , mass , and temperature , it could easily hold its volatiles against jeans escape over the life of the solar system .",
    "another process , however , presumably a giant impact @xcite , led to complete volatile loss .",
    "the arguments of o12 would instead state that the lack of ch@xmath23 on haumea constrains its density to be @xmath61 g @xmath7 , rather than its measured value of @xmath62.6 g @xmath7 @xcite !",
    "these arguments for the density constraint on makemake based on the absence of a detectable atmosphere are clearly spurious and should be given no weight .",
    "the o12 lower limit to the density of 1.4 g @xmath7 comes from using the same volatile retention models to explain the continued presence of ch@xmath23 on the surface . here",
    "the volatile loss model is used correctly . for densities below 1.4 g @xmath7 makemake",
    "must have lost all of its ch@xmath23 even if the only escape process was slow jeans escape .",
    "we retain this lower limit as a sensible constraint .    the upper limit to the density from o12 comes from assuming that the inferred value of 1.7 g @xmath7 is close to correct and positing that objects of similar size have densities within about 0.3 g @xmath7 of that value .",
    "use of this upper limit is problematic .",
    "the most important question to address about the density of makemake is whether it has a value below about 2.1 g @xmath7 , as might be typical for objects with large , potentially captured satellites , or a higher value as might be typical for objects with evidence for giant impacts . assuming that the upper limit to the density of makemake is 2.0 g @xmath7 simply asserts an answer to that question , which is clearly unacceptable .",
    "based on these considerations , we retain the 1.4 g @xmath7 lower limit based on the retention of ch@xmath23 ( though we employ a softer cutoff by assuming a one - sided gaussian distribution with a @xmath0 of 0.03 for densities below 1.4 g @xmath7 ) , and we add the only reasonable upper limit density that we can find , which is that the density is certainly  we assume  below that of solid rock , or about 3.2 g @xmath7 .",
    "we see no justification for placing any other prior constraints on the density of makemake , so from 1.4 to 3.2 g @xmath7 we assume a uniform prior .",
    "once again employing our mcmc integration , we find that when using the density prior the pdf for the projected elongation peaks strongly at 1.0 , with a 1@xmath0 upper limit of 1.06 ( fig .",
    "the smaller elongation derived here is the result of the 1.3 g @xmath7 lower limit on the density , which , for a 7.77 hour rotation period , translates to an upper limit to the true elongation , @xmath16 , of 1.20 . for the same reason ,",
    "the polar axis angle is not as strongly constrained to small values , and we find a best fit at @xmath24 .",
    "the projected polar diameter has values of @xmath25 km . by calculating the pdf of the projected area and comparing it to the results of o12",
    ", we also calculate an albedo pdf with a distribution peak and range of @xmath26 .",
    "the pdf for the density rises linearly from 1.4 to 3.2 g @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . we can derive a formal 1@xmath0 lower limit to the density of 2.14 g @xmath7 , but this lower limit is meaningless , as the distribution of the density is just the density prior modified to have a slight preference for less elongation and thus higher densities . the data themselves provide nearly no constraint on the density .",
    "as discussed by o12 , there is reason to believe that we are viewing makemake nearly pole - on .",
    "spitzer radiometry can only be fit by assuming that the surface of makemake  like that of pluto  contains a combination of very high and very low albedo regions , yet makemake shows only a 0.03 magnitude variation over its 7.77 hour rotation period @xcite .",
    "either the dark regions of makemake must be extremely symmetric with respect to the pole , which is not the case for the similarly mottled pluto @xcite and requires special pleading , or we are viewing makemake from a nearly pole - on position .    adding a prior on the pole position of makemake",
    "strongly affects the results , yet there is no obvious statistical distribution that one should adopt .",
    "we make a judgement based on the evidence above that the polar axis angle is likely less than 20 degrees . we quantify this as a prior on polar axis angle of the form of a gaussian distribution peaked at zero degrees , with a @xmath0 of 20 degrees .",
    "this prior is in addition to the prior that the axes are otherwise randomly oriented in space .",
    "the specific values can not be statistically justified , but will nonetheless serve as an instructive example of how to incorporate our expectations of the polar angle .",
    "we once again construct the 6-dimensional pdf from an mcmc analysis .",
    "we find , not surprisingly , that the polar axis angle is much more tightly confined to small angles , with the pdf peak and range of 19@xmath111 .",
    "the projected polar radius has a value of 1422@xmath114 km , while the albedo is constrained to @xmath27 .",
    "the density remains nearly unconstrained , with a pdf that again rises linearly from 1.4 to 3.2 g @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . with our prior expectation of a small polar angle ,",
    "there is less of a bias towards high densities , as small polar angle give small projected elongations regardless of the real elongation . in this case",
    "the formal 1@xmath0 lower limit on the density is 1.98 g @xmath7 , but , as before , the constraint is dominated by the prior and the data themselves give little information on the density .",
    "table 1 summarizes the results of these analyses .",
    "we have developed a new statistically rigorous approach to the analysis of dwarf planet occultation data which incorporates our knowledge of shapes of equilibrium , spherical geometry , and volatile retention to place statistically justifiable limits on the shapes of these objects .",
    "we apply the new technique to the occultation of makemake observed by @xcite , which was initially analyzed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches .",
    "we find that the `` preferred '' solution of @xcite for the elongation of makemake is unjustified and leads to incorrect estimates of the precise dimensions and albedo of makemake . in our solution",
    "in which we use the inference from photometric data that makemake is being viewed nearly pole - on , we find a 1@xmath0 upper limit to the projected elongation of makemake of 1.02 , with measured equatorial diameter of 1434@xmath114 km and a projected polar diameter of 1422@xmath114 km , yielding an albedo of 0.81@xmath2 . if we remove the external constraint on the pole position of makemake , we find instead a 1@xmath0 upper limit to the elongation of 1.06 , with a measured equatorial diameter of 1434@xmath3 km and a projected polar diameter of 1420@xmath4 km , yielding an albedo of 0.81@xmath5 .    the uncertainties reported here ( and by o12 ) are purely statistical .",
    "true shape uncertainties are also affected by deviations from our modeled equilibrium shapes .",
    "our best knowledge of the shapes of icy bodies of this diameter comes from the medium - sized icy moons of saturn . with the exception of iapetus , for which a complex thermal and rotational history within the saturnian system has been evoked , deviations from equilibrium shapes of like - sized saturnian satellites are of the order of 1 km @xcite .",
    "such shape are well below our statistical errors and so do not strong affect the reported results .",
    "the density measurement of @xcite is based on misapplication of the volatile retention models of @xcite and arbitrary assumptions about plausible densities .",
    "unfortunately , while the occultation measurements of o12 , when analyzed correctly , provide excellent constraints on the size , shape , and albedo of makemake , they contain essentially no information about density of this object . the density of makemake , while an important parameter for understanding the evolution of the population of dwarf planets , remains unknown .              , m.  e. , van dam , m.  a. , bouchez , a.  h. , le mignant , d. , campbell , r.  d. , chin , j.  c.  y. , conrad , a. , hartman , s.  k. , johansson , e.  m. , lafon , r.  e. , rabinowitz , d.  l. , stomski , jr .",
