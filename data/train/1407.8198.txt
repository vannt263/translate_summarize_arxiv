    "the use of lmis is a major advance in systems engineering in the past two decades @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lmis underlie the theory of semidefinite programming @xcite , itself a recent major innovation in convex optimization @xcite .",
    "matrix convex sets determined by lmis are based on a free analog of an affine linear functional , often called a * linear pencil*. given a positive integer @xmath21 and @xmath3 hermitian @xmath22 matrices @xmath23 let @xmath24 this linear pencil is often denoted by @xmath25 to emphasize the dependence on @xmath26 . in the case that @xmath27 , we call @xmath28 * monic*. replacing @xmath29 with a tuple @xmath6 of @xmath7 hermitian matrices and letting @xmath30 denote the kronecker product of matrices leads to the evaluation of the free affine linear functional , @xmath31 the inequality @xmath32 is a * free linear matrix inequality ( free lmi)*. the solution set @xmath33 of this free lmi is the sequence of sets @xmath34 and is known as a * free spectrahedron * ( or * free lmi domain * ) .",

    "every matrix convex set is the solution set of @xmath35 as in equation , of some monic linear pencil _ provided _ the @xmath36 are allowed to be hermitian operators on a ( common ) hilbert space .",
    "more precisely , every matrix convex set is a ( perhaps infinite ) intersection of free spectrahedra .",

    "a completely positive ( * cp * ) map @xmath50 that is trace preserving is called a * quantum channel * , and a cp map that is trace non - increasing for positive semidefinite arguments is a * quantum operation*. these maps figure prominently in quantum information theory @xcite .",

    "it is clear that an intersections of contractively tracial sets is again contractively tracial , giving rise , in the usual way , to the notion of the * contractive tracial hull * , denoted * cthull*. for a tuple @xmath66 , @xmath67 while the unital and quantum interpolation problems have very similar formulations , contractive tracial hulls possess far less structure than matrix convex hulls .",
