    "the unperturbed interface is straight and the unperturbed flow is uniform and parallel to cell walls . in the radial case the unperturbed interface is circular with the less viscous fluid pumped into the more viscous one at a point and the flow radially outward . for both situations ,",

    "the majority of the studies focus on flow in _",

    "curiously , the dynamic behavior for flow in flat cells is described by the very same set of equations as those for flow in porous media  @xcite , which is indeed a highly non - flat environment , characterized by voids and curved internal surfaces .",

    ", we consider the case in which @xmath177 and see how the curvature influences @xmath106 .",
    "since spherical hele - shaw flow involves many independent parameters we change only one relevant quantity at a time to see what each one does .",
    "we hold the unperturbed interface velocity @xmath178 and the unperturbed interface contour length @xmath179 fixed , while varying the curvature @xmath134 .",
    "this isolates the influence of spatial curvature @xmath134 from the effect of variations in @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "fixed @xmath179 means that fixed mode number @xmath30 corresponds to a fixed wavelength .",
    "we adopt an _ instantaneous _ approach : we look at the linear growth rate and mode coupling at an instant in time , ignoring the past history of how a given interface arose from some initial condition followed by growth .",
    "such an instantaneous approach , at which @xmath179 and @xmath178 have a particular value , enables us to compare the behavior of interfaces evolving in distinct background curvatures , but under dynamically equivalent circumstances .",
    "moreover , at the instant when the interface circumference @xmath179 in curved space equals the circumference in flat space , if the two velocities also match , the identity @xmath26 shows that the @xmath12 value in flat space equals the @xmath12 value in curved space .",
    "therefore , it is advantageous to look at the instantaneous tendency towards tip - splitting for interfaces of identical unperturbed @xmath178 and @xmath179 .    consider a particular @xmath178 and @xmath179 combination at the onset of growth of mode @xmath89 ( using the condition @xmath177 ) in the limit of flat space , where it is known that @xmath107 . to illustrate how tip - splitting varies with curvature for flow on a sphere , we plot in figure 4 the tip - splitting function @xmath106 as a function of @xmath134 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves refer to the behavior in the northern ( southern ) hemisphere . by inspecting figure 4",
    "we notice that , in the northern hemisphere there is a suppression of tip - splitting for increasingly larger curvature because the magnitude of @xmath106 is maximum for the flat , divergent radial case ( @xmath180 ) and decreases as curvature is increased . for each @xmath30",
    "there is some value of @xmath134 for which the circle of circumference @xmath179 hits the equator .",
    "this is precisely the point at which northern and southern hemisphere branches of the curves meet in figure 4 .    for the southern hemisphere",
    "@xmath106 is always positive .",
    "consequently , we should not expect finger tip - splitting of outward - pointing fingers in this hemisphere .",
    "actually , finger tip - splitting is replaced by tip - narrowing , along with a splitting of the inward - pointing fingers .",
    "finger tip - narrowing is regulated by the curvature @xmath134 .",
    "another noteworthy point about figure 4 is the evident symmetry - breaking in @xmath106 between northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "the justification for this asymmetry is similar to the one that explains why the interface is always in - out asymmetric in flat radial flow : if we are located at either pole we can always distinguish regions that are inside and outside the interface .",
    "that is why convergent and divergent flat , radial flows are not equivalent  @xcite . from this point of view",
    ", the asymmetry observed in figure 4 should be somehow expected .",
    "we conclude this section presenting the lowest order curvature expansion for @xmath106 and studying how curvature @xmath134 influences tip - splitting for small curvature values . using the instantaneous approach described above , series expansion of equation  ( [ t(2n , n ) ] ) for the northern hemisphere yields",
    "@xmath181   + { \\cal o } ~(k^{2}).\\ ] ] the perturbative expansion  ( [ expandedt ] ) for small @xmath134 explicitly shows a linear correction to the flat space limit ( @xmath180 ) that reduces the magnitude of @xmath106 , inhibiting finger tip - splitting .",
    "a similar kind of expansion can be done for the southern hemisphere , resulting in enhanced tip - sharpening .",
    "those results are in agreement with the small curvature behavior depicted in figure 4 .",
    "equation  ( [ expandedt ] ) allows us to make predictions about tip - splitting behavior for hele - shaw flow in ( weakly ) negatively curved backgrounds .",
    "this type of flow could happen , for instance , between two saddle - like surfaces .",
    "actually , flow in porous media seems to be somehow linked to flow on negatively curved surfaces .",
    "porous materials define multiply - connected surfaces , presenting negative _ average _ gausssian curvature @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes an infinitesimal area element and @xmath184 is the so - called genus  @xcite , which denotes the number of holes present in a given surface .",
    "expression  ( [ mean ] ) relates the integral of the gaussian curvature @xmath134 of a given surface to its topological properties , by virtue of the gauss - bonnet theorem  @xcite . from  ( [ mean ] )",
    "we verify that @xmath185 becomes progressively negative when the number of holes is increased : that is why @xmath186 for a sphere ( @xmath187 ) , @xmath188 for a torus ( @xmath189 ) and @xmath190 for a @xmath184-torus ( @xmath191 ) . in this sense ,",
    "a medium which is rich in pores ( holes ) would present negative curvature features .",
    "however , flow on surfaces of _ constant _ negative gaussian curvature is complex and to treat the problem rigorously would require an interesting generalization of our formalism beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we simply point out what would be the behavior for flow on surfaces that are slightly ( negatively ) curved .",
    "it is easy to see , by performing the substitution @xmath192 in  ( [ expandedt ] ) , that negative curvature should enhance finger splitting in comparison to the flat case .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the problem of flow in positively curved surfaces , such as the sphere , where curvature leads to suppression of tip - splitting .",
    "this sets an important distinction between hele - shaw flows on surfaces with negative curvature and those on surfaces with positive @xmath134 .",
    "our results confirm explicitly the predictions made in reference  @xcite about the role of cell curvature on finger splitting .",
    "the fact that the correction is linear in @xmath134 supports our suggestion that gaussian curvature is more relevant than mean curvature .",
    "the same expansion eq .",
    "( [ expandedt ] ) could be written in terms of the square of mean curvature @xmath135 .",
    "however , then we would predict supression of tip - splitting for both positive @xmath193 and negatively @xmath194 curved surfaces .",
    "we believe tip - splitting is enhanced for negative gaussian curvature because the metric creates ample space for the split fingers to penetrate without mutual competition .",
    "in this paper we generalized the traditional saffman - taylor problem by studying viscous flow on curved surfaces .",
    "our main purpose was to investigate the influence of spatial curvature on viscous fingering pattern formation , when fluid flow takes place on a sphere . by deriving the equation of motion for the interface pertubation amplitudes , using a mode - coupling approach ,",
    "a study of both linear and weakly nonlinear stages of evolution could be carried out .",
    "we have shown that cell curvature can be used as a control parameter to discipline splitting of the viscous fingers .",
    "the fluid - fluid interface can be more stable or unstable , with respect to tip - splitting , depending on the curvature of the surface to which the flow is confined .",
    "we also detected an asymmetry on tip - splitting behavior depending where the interface evolves : while tip - splitting may be still present on the northern hemisphere , it is completely replaced by finger tip - sharpening on the southern hemisphere .",
    "we also found evidence that hele - shaw flows on negatively curved surfaces would present enhanced tendency to tip - splitting , so highly branched patterns may be expected . in summary , we have explicitly verified that interfacial behavior is coupled to the geometry of the hele - shaw cell , so that curvature has important consequences for flow dynamics .    *",
