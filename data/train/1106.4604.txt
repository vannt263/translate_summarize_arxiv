    "since the advent of the string theories as a candidate to the unified theory , lorentz- and cpt- violations are expected at planck scale @xcite , and a background anisotropy on the space - time must correct the physics at a low energy scale .",
    "for instance , at a standard model scale , the extended standard model sme @xcite was proposed as a possible extension of the minimal standard model of the fundamental interactions . even though the expectation of the lorentz- and cpt violation , these effects are very small , and the sme has also been used as a framework to get stringent bounds on the lorentz - symmetry violating ( lv ) coefficients @xcite , @xcite . in this framework , there are a large number of results in the literature that investigate these effects in different situations , like system involving photons@xcite , @xcite , radiative corrections @xcite , fermions @xcite , neutrinos @xcite , topological defects @xcite , topological phases @xcite , cosmic rays @xcite , supersymmetry @xcite , particle decays @xcite , and other relevant aspects @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this violation can be implemented in the fermion sector , for example , by @xmath0 , leading to a modified dirac theory @xcite .",
    "it also has consequences in  a very low energy regime , like in atomic physics , condensed matter and so on , taking into account the non relativistic limit , in order to obtain experimental bounds on the lorentz symmetry braking ( lsb ) parameters and other effects , as the generation of an anomalous magnetic moment by a non - minimal coupling covariant derivative @xcite , @xcite .    in the gauge sector",
    ", it has been introduced by the pioneering work by carrol , field and jackiw , modifying the electromagnetic maxwell lagrangian by means of a chern - simons type extra term @xmath1 .",
    "this modify the dispersion relation of the photon introducing a topological mass and preserving the gauge invariance .",
    "it has been pointed out by perez - victoria @xcite that this term is a one loop quantum correction of the fermion coupling to the background .",
    "even though lsb is a theoretical implication , the search for a deviation on the photon dispersion relation has important consequences on cosmic physics , like gamma ray bursts , near stars with strong magnetic field and vacuum birefringence .",
    "this can justify the study of the statistical behavior of the photon gas under a non - linear dispersion relation . as this violation",
    "is expected to be observed only at ultra high energy , this address to the question of its statistical behavior in a ultra - relativistic photon gas , not only to get more stringent bounds on the lsb parameters but also an interesting phenomenon that could be related by this breaking .",
    "another interesting point is related to the light bosons @xcite , which are described by a scalar field , when minimally coupled to gravity it could be a candidate for dark matter .",
    "its mass is constrained to the order @xmath2 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors argue that the neutrino radiation behavior is linked to a ultra - relativistic transition .",
    "this scalar field falls in the classification of hot dark matter ( hdm ) , in the sense that it behaves as radiation at its decoupling epoch .",
    "this is related to a bose - einstein condensation in ultra - relativistic gas .",
    "these facts motivate the study of a bose - einstein gas with a non - linear dispersion relation at the ultra - relativistic level .    in this paper",
    ", we study the statistical mechanics of an ideal gas embedded in a lsb background , starting from a massive chern - simons dispersion relation .",

    "relativistic , when the background is larger than the momentum of the particle , we will show that in this limit our results are the same obtained when started by the sme lagrangian where a non - relativistic hamiltonian is computed for the free the bose - einstein , fermi dirac and boltzmann gas @xcite .",
    "our contribution in this  paper is the study of the relativistic gas .",
    "we shall see , for the bose gas , that lsb background can induce a phase transition for the high energy gas .",
    "as a first step , we analyze the statistical mechanics for an ideal boltzmann gas , by computing the relativistic and the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the gas is described by the dispersion relation raised from carroll - field - jackiw model , which is given by , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a four - vector background field .",

    "the behavior of the boltzmann gas in the presence of background field is illustrated in the figures that follow . in fig.1",
    "we can observe the behavior of the internal energy with the temperature and a fixed parameter @xmath16 .",
    "for large temperatures all the curves tend asymptotically to the value @xmath47 and collapse to this value when the parameter v goes to zero .",
    "the same behavior can be seen in fig.2 , where @xmath48 is a function of @xmath16 .",
    "note here that the field @xmath16 clearly introduces an effective mass in the system so that the internal energy increases .",

    "<S> in this paper we study the effects of lorentz symmetry breaking on thermodynamics properties of ideal gases . </S>",
    "<S> inspired in the dispersion relation came from the carroll - field - jackiw model for electrodynamics with lorentz and cpt violation term , we compute the thermodynamics quantities for a boltzmann , fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions . </S>",
    "<S> two regimes are analyzed : the non - relativistic and the relativistic one . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> we show that the topological mass induced by the chern - simons term behaves as a chemical potential . for the bose - einstein gases </S>",
    "<S> it could be found a condensation in both regimes , being the appearance of a condensate in the relativistic regime , the main contribution of this work . </S>"
