    "sec : intro changes are inevitable in nature , and those that are most dramatic with often drastic consequences are the ones that occur _ all of a sudden_. a particular class of such changes comprises those in which the system during its temporal evolution makes a sudden jump ( a  reset \" ) to a fixed state or configuration .",
    "many nonequilibrium processes are encountered across disciplines , e.g. , in physics , biology , and information processing , which involve sudden transitions between different states or configurations .",
    "the erasure of a bit of information  @xcite by mesoscopic machines may be thought of as a physical process in which a memory device that is strongly affected by thermal fluctuations resets its state ( 0 or 1 ) to a prescribed erasure state  @xcite . in biology",
    ", resetting plays an important role inter alia in sensing of extracellular ligands by single cells  @xcite , and in transcription of genetic information by macromolecular enzymes called rna polymerases  @xcite . during rna transcription ,",
    "the recovery of rna polymerases from inactive transcriptional pauses is a result of a kinetic competition between diffusion and resetting of the polymerase to an active state via rna cleavage  @xcite , as has been recently tested in high - resolution single - molecule experiments  @xcite .",
    "also , there are ample examples of biochemical processes that initiate ( i.e. , reset ) at random so - called _ stopping _ times  @xcite , with the initiation at each instance occurring in different regions of space  @xcite . in addition , interactions play a key role in determining when and where a chemical reaction occurs  @xcite , a fact that affects the statistics of the resetting process . for instance , in the above mentioned example of recovery of rna polymerase by the process of resetting , the interaction of the hybrid dna - rna may alter the time that a polymerase takes to recover from its inactive state  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite pertinent and timely to study resetting of mesoscopic systems that evolve under the influence of external or conservative force fields .",
    "simple diffusion subject to resetting to a given location at random times has emerged in recent years as a convenient theoretical framework to discuss the phenomenon of stochastic resetting @xcite .",
    "the framework has later been generalized to consider different choices of the resetting position @xcite , resetting of continuous - time random walks @xcite , lvy @xcite and exponential constant - speed flights @xcite , time - dependent resetting of a brownian particle @xcite , and in discussing memory effects @xcite and phase transitions in reset processes @xcite .",
    "stochastic resetting has also been invoked in the context of many - body dynamics , e.g. , in reaction - diffusion models @xcite , fluctuating interfaces @xcite , interacting brownian motion @xcite , and in discussing optimal search times in a crowded environment @xcite . however , little is known about the statistics of stochastic resetting of brownian particles that diffuse under the influence of force fields  @xcite , and that too in presence of a rate of resetting that varies in space .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of overdamped brownian particles immersed in a thermal environment , which diffuse under the influence of a force field , and whose position may be stochastically reset to a given spatial location with a rate of resetting that has an essential dependence on space . we propose a novel technique that allows to obtain exact expressions for the transition probability prior to the first reset , the first reset - time distribution , and , most importantly , the stationary spatial distribution of the particle . our technique is based on the feynman - kac formalism of treating stochastic processes @xcite , and consists in a mapping of the dynamics of the brownian resetting problem to a suitable quantum mechanical evolution in imaginary time . to demonstrate the potential of our technique , we consider several different stochastic resetting problems , see fig .",
