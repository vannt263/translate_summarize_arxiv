    "we obtain the bound @xmath13 which is the classical loomis - whitney inequality in three space dimensions , see @xcite .    the question which we address here",
    "is the following : does the estimate remain true if @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are bounded subset of transversal , sufficiently smooth , and oriented surfaces in @xmath0 ?    this question has been answered in the affirmative in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 7 ) , along with a quantitative estimate , under the assumption of @xmath14 regularity and a local transversality condition on the surfaces . in considering this question",
    "we are motivated by problems which arise in the analysis of bilinear @xmath15 estimates in various nonlinear dispersive equations .",
    "precisely , one can view the estimate as a limiting case of the following bound : @xmath16 here @xmath17 are assumed to have fourier support supported in a fixed unit ball , and the norms @xmath18 , respectively @xmath19 are defined by @xmath20 respectively @xmath21 by rescaling , this implies estimates on dyadic frequency scales , in the low modulation region",
    ". bounds of this type have already appeared  at least implicitely  in the study of bilinear interactions in many semilinear equations with nontrivial resonance sets , i.e. when bilinear interactions of solutions to the linear homogeneous equation have an output near the characteristic set , which in our context means that @xmath22 has a nontrivial intersection with @xmath5 .",

    "other examples are the bounds for the kp - i equation considered in @xcite . a large class of bilinear and multilinear estimates",
    "have been systematically studied in @xcite ; however , this does not include the present setup .    in most applications to dispersive equations bilinear estimates",
    "are proved in an ad - hoc manner , taking advantage of the exact form of the surfaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in all cases mentioned above the three surfaces have nonvanishing curvature , and",
    "one may ask which ( if any ) is the role played by the curvature in general .",
    "it is well known that the nonvanishing curvature plays a fundamental role in the study of nonlinear dispersive equations , as it insures good decay properties for the fundamental solution of the corresponding linear equation , as well as strichartz and other estimates for solutions to the linear equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the bound is still valid when @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are transversal planes .",
    "note that the role of curvature and transversality has been clarified in @xcite in a much broader context : curvature is dispensable for the validity of estimate .",
    "however , it still is desireable to gain a better understanding of the interplay of the necessary size , regularity , transversality and curvature assumptions on the surfaces under which sharp quantitative and scaleable estimates of the type hold true .",

    "we conclude the section with a discussion of further versions of our main result . partitioning the three surfaces into smaller pieces and using linear changes of coordinates",
