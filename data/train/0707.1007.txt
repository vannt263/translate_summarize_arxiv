    "due to the large @xmath2 cross section at 1.96 tev @xmath3 collisions , the tevatron collider at fermilalb is currently the largest source of @xmath4-hadrons and provides a very rich environment for the study of @xmath4-hadrons .",
    "it is also the unique place to study high mass @xmath4-hadrons such as @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath4-baryons and excited @xmath4-hadrons states .",
    "cdf and d  are both symmetric multipurpose detectors  @xcite .",
    "they are essentially similar and consist of vertex detectors , high resolution tracking chambers in a magnetic field , finely segmented hermitic calorimeters and muons momentum spectrometers , both providing a good lepton identification .",
    "they have fast data acquisition systems with several levels of online triggers and filters and are able to trigger at the hardware level on large track impact parameters , enhancing the potential of their physics programs .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing is a well established phenomenon in particle physics .",
    "it proceeds via a flavor changing weak interaction in which the flavor eigenstates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are quantum superpositions of the two mass eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the probability for a @xmath6 meson produced at time @xmath10 to decay as @xmath6 or @xmath7 at proper time @xmath11 is an oscillatory function with a frequency @xmath12 , the difference in mass between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "oscillation in the @xmath13 system is well established experimentally with a precisely measured oscillation frequency @xmath14 .",
    "the world average value is @xmath15 ps@xmath16  @xcite . in the @xmath0 system ,",
    "the expected oscillation frequency value within the standard model ( sm ) is approximately 35 times faster than @xmath14 . in the sm ,",
    "the oscillation frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath17 are proportional to the fundamental ckm matrix elements @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , and can be used to determine their values .",
    "this determination , however , has large theoretical uncertainties , but the combination of the @xmath17 measurement with the precisely measured @xmath14 allows the determination of the ratio @xmath20 with a significantly smaller theoretical uncertainty .",
    "both d  and cdf have performed @xmath0-@xmath21 mixing analysis using 1 fb@xmath16 of data  @xcite .",
    "the strategies used by the two experiments to measure @xmath17 are very similar .",
    "they schematically proceed as follows : the @xmath0 decay is reconstructed in one side of the event and its flavor at decay time is determined from its decay products . the @xmath0 proper decay time is measured from the the difference between the @xmath0 vertex and the primary vertex of the event .",
    "the @xmath0 flavor at production time is determined from information in the opposite and/or the same - side of the event .",
    "finally , @xmath17 is extracted from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit of mixed and unmixed events , which combines , among other information , the decay time , the decay time resolution and @xmath4-hadron flavor tagging . in the following only the latest cdf result is presented .",
    "the cdf experiment has reconstructed @xmath0 events in both semileptonic @xmath22 ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) and hadronic @xmath25 decays . in both cases",
    "the @xmath26 is reconstructed in the channels @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "additional partially reconstructed hadronic decays , @xmath32 and @xmath33 with unreconstructed @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath36 and @xmath37 decay modes , have also been used .",
    "the signal yields are 61,500 semileptonic decays , 5,600 fully reconstructed and 3,100 partially reconstructed hadronic decays .",
    "this correponds to an effective statistical increase in the number of reconstructed events of 2.5 compared to the first cdf published analysis  @xcite .",
    "this improvement was obtained mainly by using particle identification in the event selection , by using the artificial neural network ( ann ) selection for hadronic modes and by loosening the kinematical selection .",

    "the opposite - side tagging exploits the fact that @xmath4 quarks are dominently produced in @xmath2 pairs in hadron colliders .",
    "same side tagging relies on the charges and the identity of associated particles produced in the fragmentation of the @xmath4 quark that produces the reconstructed @xmath0 .",

    "the use of an ann improves the combined opposite - side tag effectiveness by 20% ( @xmath53% ) compared to the previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "the dilution is measured in data using large samples of kinematically similar @xmath13 and @xmath54 decays .",
    "the same - side flavor tags rely on the identification of the charge of the kaon produced from the left over @xmath55 in the process of @xmath0 fragmentation .",
    "any nearby charged particle to the reconstructed @xmath0 , identified as a kaon , is expected to be correlated to the @xmath0 flavor , with a @xmath56 correlated to a @xmath0 and @xmath57 correlated to @xmath58 .",
    "an ann is used to combine particle - identification likelihood based on information from the @xmath59 and from the time - of - flight system , with kinematic quantities of the kaon candidate into a single variable .",
    "the dilution of the same side tag is estimated using monte carlo simulated data samples .",
    "the predicted effectiveness of the same - side flavor tag is q=3.7% ( 4.8% ) in the hadronic ( semileptonic ) decay sample .",
    "the use of ann increased the @xmath60 value by 10% compared to the previous analysis  @xcite .    if both a same - side tag and an opposite - side tag are present , the information from both tags are combined assuming they are independent .",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is used to search for @xmath0 oscillations in the reconstructed @xmath0 decays samples .",
    "the likelihood combines masses , decay time , decay - time rsolution , and flavor tagging information for each reconstructed @xmath0 candidate , and includes terms for signal and each type of background . the technique used to extract @xmath17 from the unbinned maximum likelihood fit , is the amplitude scan method  @xcite which consists of multiplying the oscillation term of the signal probablity density function in the likelihood by an amplitude @xmath61 , and fit its value for different @xmath17 values .",
