    "in the last few years , several important developments have taken place in the context of phenomenology of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , both from theoretical as well as experimental point of view . in this context",
    ", it may be noted that texture specific mass matrices seem to be very helpful in understanding the pattern of quark mixings and cp violation @xcite .",
    "likewise , in the leptonic sector also texture zero mass matrices @xcite-@xcite have proved to be useful in explaining the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings , some of which have been recently measured with a good deal of accuracy . in particular , the fritzsch - like texture four zero quark mass matrices are quite successful in reconciling the strong hierarchy of quark masses and the smallness of flavor mixing angles @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the case of neutrinos , the texture four zero mass matrices are able to accommodate the neutrino oscillation data representing large mixing angles quite well @xcite-@xcite .",
    "further , apart from being related to the nearest neighbor interaction ( nni ) form of the mass matrices through weak basis rotations @xcite , these texture 4 zero mass matrices are known to be compatible with specific models of guts , e.g. , so(10 ) @xcite and these could be obtained using considerations of abelian family symmetries @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in case we have to consider quark - lepton unification @xcite , then it becomes interesting to note that the corresponding fritzsch - like texture 4 zero neutrino mass matrices have been shown to be seesaw invariant @xcite .",
    "also , it may be added that the structure of these matrices is very much in agreement with the hypothesis of natural mass matrices advocated by @xcite .",
    "it may be mentioned that in the case of quark mass matrices , usually the elements are assumed to follow ` strong hierarchy ' , whereas there is no such compulsion for the leptonic mass matrices .",
    "therefore , in case we have to invoke quark - lepton unification @xcite , it becomes interesting to examine whether ` weakly hierarchical ' quark mass matrices are able to reproduce the mixing data which involves strongly hierarchical parameters .",
    "this is all the more important as the texture 4 zero mass matrices perhaps provide the simplest parallel structure for quark and lepton mass matrices which are compatible with the low energy data .    realizing the importance of fritzsch - like hermitian texture 4 zero mass matrices in the context of quarks , as emphasized above , a few years back xing and zhang @xcite have attempted to find the parameter space of the elements of these mass matrices .",
    "their analysis has provided good deal of information regarding the space available to various parameters as well as have provided valuable insight into the ` structural features ' of texture 4 zero mass matrices . in this context , it may be noted that the hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices is largely governed by the ( 2,2 ) element of the matrix . in their analysis",
    ", attempt has been made to go somewhat beyond the minimal values of this element , corresponding to the ` strong hierarchy ' case , however in case we have to consider the ` weak hierarchy ' case as well then there seems a further need to consider a still larger range for this element .",
    "further , their analysis has also given valuable clues about the phase structure of the mass matrices , in particular for the strong hierarchy case they conclude that only one of the two phase parameters plays a dominant role .",
    "since , the phases of the mass matrices play a crucial role in giving information about the cp violating phase of the ckm matrix , therefore it would be interesting to find out the ranges of both the phases in the context of strong as well as weak hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices .    it may be noted that in the last few years there have been considerable improvements in the measurement of ckm parameters and light quark masses .",
    "however , at present , even after recent updating by various groups @xcite-@xcite , the situation regarding the element @xmath2 is not as clear as for the other ckm matrix elements .",
    "for example , as per pdg 2008 @xcite its exclusive and inclusive values respectively are @xmath3 and @xmath4 . it may be noted that although the difference between the exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 is not statistically significant , however recent unitarity based analyses @xcite as well as results from a global fit @xcite emphasize exclusive value of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it becomes important to examine separately the implications of exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 for the phenomenology of quark mass matrices .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to update and broaden the scope of the analysis carried out by xing and zhang @xcite as well as to examine the implications of recent precision measurements on the structural features of texture 4 zero mass matrices for exclusive and inclusive @xmath2 separately .",
    "taking clue from the quark - lepton symmetry it would also be desirable to explore the parameter space of the elements of the mass matrices , considering not only the usual ` strong hierarchy ' amongst them but also for the ` weak hierarchy ' case . in view of the more precise information regarding cp violating parameters , it would be interesting to find out the ranges of both the phases having their origin in the mass matrices which are compatible with the quark mixing data .",
    "further , for the sake of completeness it would also be desirable to construct the ckm mixing matrix as well as to evaluate the jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter @xmath5 and the cp violating phase @xmath6 .",
    "the detailed plan of the paper is as follows . in section ( [ form ] ) , we detail the essentials of the formalism regarding the texture specific mass matrices .",
    "inputs used in the present analysis and the methodology of the calculations have been given in section ( [ inputs ] ) .",
    "the discussion of the results have been presented in section ( [ cal ] ) .",
    "finally , section ( [ summ ] ) summarizes our conclusions .",
    "to begin with , we define the modified fritzsch - like matrices , e.g. , m_i = ( 0 & a_i & 0 + a_i^ * & d_i & b_i + 0 & b_i^ * & c_i ) , i = u , d , [ uniq ] @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively corresponding to the mass matrix in the up sector and the down sector .",
    "it may be noted that each of the above matrix is texture 2 zero type with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the various relations between the elements of the mass matrices @xmath11 essentially correspond to the structural features of the mass matrices including their hierarchies .    in the absence of any standard definition in the literature for ` weak ' and ` strong ' hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices , for the purpose of present work we consider these as follows . as is usual",
    "the element @xmath12 takes a value much smaller than the other three elements of the mass matrix which can assume different relations amongst each other , defining different hierarchies .",
    "for example , in case @xmath13 it would lead to a strongly hierarchical mass matrix whereas a weaker hierarchy of the mass matrix implies @xmath14 .",
    "it may also be added that for the purpose of numerical work , one can conveniently take the ratio @xmath15 characterizing strong hierarchy whereas @xmath16 implying weak hierarchy .",
    "this can be understood by expressing these parameters in terms of the quark masses , in particular @xmath17 implies @xmath18 and @xmath19 leads to @xmath20 .    to facilitate diagonalization ,",
    "the complex mass matrix @xmath21 @xmath22 can be expressed as m_i= q_i m_i^r p_i [ mk ] or m_i^r= q_i^ m_i p_i^ , [ mkr ] where @xmath23 is a real symmetric matrix with real eigenvalues and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are diagonal phase matrices .",
    "the matrix @xmath23 can be diagonalized by the orthogonal transformation , e.g. , m_i^diag = o_i^t m_i^r o_i , [ o1]where m_i^diag = diag(m_1,-m_2,m_3 ) , the subscripts 1 , 2 and 3 referring respectively to @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the @xmath28 sector as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the @xmath31 sector . using the invariants , tr@xmath23 ,",
    "tr @xmath32 and det@xmath23 , the values of the elements of the mass matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in terms of the free parameter @xmath36 and the quark masses are given as c_i & = & ( m_1-m_2+m_3-d_i ) , +        the exact diagonalizing transformation @xmath37 is expressed as o_i = (    & & + & & + & &    ) .",
    "[ ou ] 0.5 cm    it may be noted that while finding the diagonalizing transformation @xmath37 , one has the freedom to choose several equivalent possibilities of phases .",
    "similarly , while normalizing the diagonalized matrix to quark masses , one again has the freedom to choose the phases for the quark masses .",
    "this is due to the fact that the diagonalizing transformations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 occur in a particular manner in the weak charge current interactions of quarks to give the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "as is usual , we have chosen the phase of @xmath38 to be negative facilitating the diagonalization process as well as the construction of the ckm matrix .",
    "this is one of the possibilities considered by xing and zhang @xcite , in particular it corresponds to their @xmath39 .",
    "the other possibilities considered by them are related and are all equivalent as well , these only redefine the phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 which in any case are arbitrary . for the present work , we have chosen the possibility , o_i= (  o_i(11 ) &  o_i(12 ) &  o_i(13 ) +  o_i(21 ) & -o_i(22 ) &  o_i(23 ) + -o_i(31 ) &  o_i(32 ) &  o_i(33 ) ) .",
    "the ckm mixing matrix @xmath42 which measures the non - trivial mismatch between diagonalizations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 can be obtained using @xmath43 through the relation v_ckm= o_u^t ( p_u p_d^ ) o_d .",
    "explicitly , the elements of the ckm mixing matrix can be expressed as v_l m = o_1 l^u o_1 m^d e^-i _ 1 + o_2 l^u o_2 m^d + o_3 l^u o_3 m^d e^i _ 2 , [ vckmelement ] where the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 run respectively over @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "before discussing the results of our analysis , we would first like to briefly mention the inputs used for carrying out the calculations . we have adopted the following ranges of quark masses @xcite at the @xmath48 energy scale , e.g. ,  m_u=1.27^+0.5_-0.42 mev ,  m_d=2.90^+1.24_-1.19 mev ,   m_s=55^+16_-15 mev ,   +  m_c=0.619 0.084 gev ,   m_b=2.89 0.09 gev ,   m_t=171.7 3.0 gev .",
    "[ qmasses ] the light quark masses @xmath49 , @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath51 have been further constrained using the following mass ratios given by @xcite  m_u / m_d = 0.553 0.043 ,  m_s / m_d = 18.9 0.8 . [ ratios ]    further , we have given full variation to the phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been given wide variation in conformity with the hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices e.g. , @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "the extended range of these parameters allows one to carry out the calculations for the case of weak hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices as well .",
    "also , it needs to be mentioned that the present range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is much wider than the one considered by xing and zhang @xcite .",
    "in particular , we have considered @xmath54 , whereas xing and zhang have emphasized @xmath55 which corresponds to the case of strong hierarchy amongst the elements of the mass matrices .",
    "furthermore , we have imposed the following constraints due to the latest pdg 2008 values @xcite ,    10 ^ -3 ,   + v_ub(excl.)= 0.00350.0006 ,   v_ub(incl.)= 0.004120.00036 , + sin2= 0.681 0.025 .  [ ckmvalues ]",
    "it may be noted that the calculations have been carried out separately for both exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath56 .",
    "in view of the fact that one of the aim of the present analysis is to update as well as to extend the analysis of xing and zhang @xcite , for exclusive and inclusive value of @xmath56 we have carried out a detailed analysis regarding the structural features of the mass matrices by incorporating the extended ranges of the elements @xmath57 @xmath58 as well as by imposing the constraints given in equation ( [ ckmvalues ] ) . to this end , we first present the results pertaining to exclusive value of @xmath56 , the case of its inclusive value will be discussed later .    to begin with , in figure [ cucd ]",
    "we have plotted @xmath59 versus @xmath60 .",
    "a look at the figure reveals that both @xmath61 as well as @xmath60 take values from @xmath62 , which interestingly indicates the ratios being almost proportional .",
    "also , the figure gives interesting clues regarding the role of strong and weak hierarchy .",
    "in particular , one finds that in case one restricts to the assumption of strong hierarchy then these ratios take large values around @xmath63 .",
    "however , for the case of weak hierarchy , the ratios @xmath59 and @xmath64 take much larger number of values , in fact almost the entire range mentioned above , which are compatible with the data .    in figure",
    "[ dudd ] , the plot of @xmath65 versus @xmath66 has been given which clearly brings out that the ratio @xmath67 whereas the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "one finds that when the strong hierarchy assumption is considered then the ratio @xmath65 takes value around @xmath69 whereas @xmath70 .",
    "again , we find that the ranges of these ratios corresponding to the weak hierarchy cases are much wider .",
    "the ranges of the parameters plotted in figures [ cucd ] and [ dudd ] not only have implications for the structural features of the mass matrices , but also indicate that there are large number of possibilities for which one can achieve compatibility of texture 4 zero mass matrices with the ckm mixing data .    in figure [ phi1phi2 ]",
    ", we present the plot of @xmath40 versus @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly , the present refined inputs limit the ranges of the two phases to @xmath71 and @xmath72 . keeping in mind that full variation has been given to the free parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , corresponding to both strong as well as weak hierarchy cases , it may be noted that the allowed ranges of the two phases come out to be rather narrow . in particular , for the strong hierarchy case one gets @xmath73 , whereas for the case of weak hierarchy @xmath41 takes almost its entire range mentioned above .",
    "further , it may be mentioned that this figure should not be directly compared with the corresponding @xmath40 versus @xmath41 plot given by @xcite as they have considered different initial phases .",
    "also , our analysis indicates that although @xmath74 , still both the phases are required for fitting the mixing data .",
    "it may also be noted that the phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the elements of the ckm mixing matrix can be easily used to obtain angles of the unitarity triangle .    it may be noted that a comparison of these figures with the corresponding plots by @xcite immediately reveals that in the specified ranges of the parameters our results are compatible with theirs .",
    "further , it may be noted that a direct comparison of the ranges of various parameters considered by us and those given by @xcite is not possible , however one may to able to compare the ranges of the elements of the mass matrices , which will be discussed later . for the other figures given in their analysis",
    ", it may be mentioned that we obtain the ones which are quite compatible with their plots as well as lead to similar consequences and so these are not presented here .    as a next step",
    ", we would like to emphasize the role of the hierarchy defining parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "to this end , in figure [ dumtddmb ] we have plotted @xmath77 versus @xmath78 , representing an extended range of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . a closer look at the figure reveals both @xmath79 as well as @xmath80 take values @xmath81 .",
    "the lower limit of the range i.e. when the ratios @xmath79 and @xmath80 are around @xmath82 corresponds to strong hierarchy amongst the elements of the mass matrices , whereas when the elements have weak hierarchy then these ratios take a much larger range of values . from this one may conclude that in the case of strongly hierarchical elements of the texture 4 zero mass matrices , we have limited compatibility of these matrices with the quark mixing data , whereas the weakly hierarchical ones indicate the compatibility for much broader range of the elements .",
    "the above discussion can also be understood by the construction of the mass matrices . however , as the phases of the elements of the mass matrices can be separated out , as can be seen from equation ( [ mkr ] ) , one needs to consider @xmath23 ( @xmath53 ) instead of @xmath21 .",
    "the ranges of the elements of these matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 are as follows m_u^r = m_t ( 0 & 0.000174 - 0.000252 & 0 + 0.000174 - 0.000252 & 0.0464 - 0.4870 & 0.2184 - 0.5017 + 0 & 0.2184 - 0.5017 & 0.5094 - 0.9500 ) , [ mu ]    m_d^r = m_b ( 0 & 0.003555 - 0.006154 & 0 + 0.003555 - 0.006154 & 0.0276 - 0.4448 & 0.2194 - 0.5044 + 0 & 0.2194 - 0.5044 & 0.5418 - 0.9505 ) .",
    "[ md ] these matrices lead to interesting consequences regarding the structural features characterized by relative magnitudes of the elements of the mass matrices .",
    "it may be noted that the elements of the mass matrices @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath57 satisfy the relation @xmath88 for both the strong and the weak hierarchy cases characterized respectively by @xmath89 and @xmath14 .",
    "this relation can be easily derived by using expressions mentioned in equation ( [ elements ] ) as well as can be numerically checked from the above mentioned mass matrices in equations ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ md ] ) .",
    "the above constraint on the elements of the mass matrices as well as the ranges of various ratios , particularly in the case of weak hierarchy , provide an interesting possibility for checking the viability of various mass matrices formulated at the guts scale or obtained using horizontal symmetries . from a different point of view , this can also provide vital clues to the formulation of mass matrices which are in agreement with the low energy data .    coming to the results pertaining to the inclusive value of @xmath2 , we find that the corresponding figures do not show much change as compared to the earlier figures plotted using the exclusive value of @xmath2 , therefore these have not been presented here .",
    "the mass matrices @xmath83 and @xmath84 constructed using the inclusive value of @xmath2 are as follows m_u^r = m_t ( 0 & 0.000179 - 0.000266 & 0 + 0.000179 - 0.000266 & 0.0696 - 0.4928 & 0.2610 - 0.5018 + 0 & 0.2610 - 0.5018 & 0.5036 - 0.9268 ) , [ muin ]    m_d^r = m_b ( 0 & 0.003303 - 0.006462 & 0 + 0.003703 - 0.006462 & 0.0552 - 0.4586 & 0.2686 - 0.5065 + 0 & 0.2686 - 0.5065 & 0.5280 - 0.9236 ) . [ mdin ]",
    "a comparison of these matrices with the ones mentioned in equations ( [ mu ] ) and ( [ md ] ) reveals that the ( 2,2 ) element @xmath57 of these matrices appear to be quite different for the corresponding @xmath83 and @xmath84 matrices for the case of exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the lower limits of the element @xmath86 of the mass matrices are quite different for both the @xmath83 and @xmath84 matrices corresponding to exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , it seems that refinements in the evaluation of exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 would have implications for the hierarchy of the elements of the texture 4 zero mass matrices .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it seems interesting to compare the ranges of the elements of the above mentioned mass matrices with those constructed by xing and zhang @xcite .",
    "the comparison immediately reveals that in the present work we have been able to achieve agreement with the ckm mixing data for much wider ranges of the elements of the mass matrices .",
    "a closer scrutiny of our results reveals that these wider ranges are essentially due to wider ranges for the hierarchy defining parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it may be added that in case we restrict ourselves to the strong hierarchy case , then we are able to reproduce the matrices given by @xcite .    after constructing the mass matrices ,",
    "it is desirable to construct the corresponding ckm mixing matrix and compare it with the one arrived through global analysis . to this end",
    ", we have considered the average value of @xmath2 given by pdg 2008 , the other input parameters remain the same .",
    "the ckm mixing matrix so obtained is as follows v_ckm = ( 0.9738 - 0.9747 &   0.2236 - 0.2274 &   0.00357 - 0.00429 + 0.2234 - 0.2274 &   0.9729 - 0.9739 &   0.0401 - 0.0423 + 0.0057 - 0.0114 &   0.0388 - 0.0420 &   0.9991 - 0.9992 ) .",
    "[ 1sm ] a general look at the matrix reveals that the ranges of ckm elements obtained here are quite compatible with those obtained by recent global analyses @xcite- @xcite .",
    "we have also evaluated the jarlskog s rephasing invariant parameter @xmath5 using the average value of @xmath2 which comes out to be j=(1.807 - 3.977 ) 10 ^ -5 [ j ] .",
    "further , using this value of @xmath5 we obtain the following range of the cp violating phase @xmath6 = 28.8.8^o- 110.4^o .",
    "[ delta]the above mentioned ranges of the parameter @xmath5 and the phase @xmath6 are inclusive of the values given by pdg 2008 @xcite .",
    "in the light of recent precision measurements , we have made an attempt to update and broaden the scope of the analysis carried out by xing and zhang @xcite as well as have carried out a detailed analysis regarding the structural features of the mass matrices .",
    "the implications of these measurements on the texture 4 zero mass matrices have been examined by considering not only the usual ` strong hierarchy ' amongst the elements of these matrices , defined as @xmath90 , but also for the ` weak hierarchy ' case given by @xmath14 . for both the exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the analysis has been carried out by giving wide variation to the hierarchy defining parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "further , in view of the more precise information regarding cp violating parameters , the ranges of both the phases @xmath40 and @xmath41 , having their origin in the mass matrices , have been found .",
    "we find that despite considering weak hierarchy still both the phases are required to fit the data , in particular these come out to be @xmath71 and @xmath91 .",
    "also for both the exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 , the texture 4 zero mass matrices are compatible with recent results emerging from global fits @xcite- @xcite for weak as well as strong hierarchy of the elements of the mass matrices .",
    "a comparison of @xmath83 and @xmath84 matrices corresponding to exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 reveals that the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath86 ( @xmath53 ) would have implications for these values of @xmath2 . in conclusion , we would like to state that even weakly hierarchical mass matrices can explain the quark masses and mixing data which are strongly hierarchical .",
    "this , in turn , would have important implications for model building of the fermion mass matrices .",

    "<S> we have attempted to extend the parameter space of the elements of the texture 4 zero hermitian quark mass matrices , to include the case of ` weak hierarchy ' amongst them along with the usually considered ` strong hierarchy ' case . </S>",
    "<S> this has been carried out by giving wide variation to the hierarchy defining parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 , having implications for the structural features of the mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we find that not only the weakly hierarchical mass matrices are able to reproduce the strongly hierarchical mixing angles but also both the phases having their origin in the mass matrices have to be non zero to achieve compatibility of these matrices with recent quark mixing data . further noting the difference between the exclusive and inclusive values of @xmath2 , we have carried out separate analyses corresponding to these . </S>"
