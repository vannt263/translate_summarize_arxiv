    "compared to the `` pair method '' , the main difference is that , the above pictures of ar and ec plateaus and their energy shifts are only valid within the energy window @xmath39 , which is pinned by the semi - infinite sc lead as a bath . outside this energy window of the sc ground state ,",
    "since the electrons do not have to be bounded as cooper pairs , the ar can hardly happen ; similarly , now the injecting electron will be easier to be absorbed into the sc lead ( which was absent in the `` pair method '' ) , rather than transmitted to the right lead , so that the ec vanishes .",
    "hereafter , we will only present simulation results from more physical `` lead method '' , which is more closely related to the experimental setup .",
    "so far , the onsite energy @xmath19 of the central region has been set to zero , and the car is zero . once @xmath19 is turned on , as shown in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( g ) and ( h ) , the perfect ar plateaus are left untouched , but some fraction of the ecs ( blue lines ) has been converted into cars ( green lines ) . because of the finite @xmath20 , this car is also spin polarized .",
    "for example , let us fix at a definite energy @xmath3 marked by the vertical dashed line in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( g ) and ( h ) .",

    "[ figschematic ] ( a ) .",
    "an injecting spin down electron from the left lead ( must be along the lower edge ) will result in an almost perfect local ar back to the left lead , and no ec or car can happen .",
    "on the other hand , an injecting spin up electron ( must be along the upper edge ) will exhibit ec or car to the right lead , but with negligible ar .",
    "notice that , besides the spin filter , now we have realized a complete spatial separation of the car @xmath40 [ green line in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( g ) ] from other channels at energy @xmath3 : the only coexisting output channel in the right lead is the ec [ blue line in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( g ) ] , but it is flowing along the _ opposite _ edge .",
    "another nonzero transport channel at this energy is the ar [ red line in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( h ) ] , but it is in the left lead .",
    "this spatially separated car is the first important finding in this manuscript .    in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( g ) and ( h ) , @xmath41 oscillates with the energy , which reflects the resonant competition between the topological edge states and the superconducting order , as explained in the following .",
    "we have seen that , outside the ar plateau , the robust edge states tend to transport the injecting electron through the sample [ i.e. , ec , blue lines in fig.[figspectrumtocar ] ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ] without a local cooper pair forming near the left boundary . however , during its journey towards the right lead , this electron always has the probability of forming a cooper pair with another electron ( with opposite spin ) which can only come from the opposite edge .",
    "we have checked that for this system , the width @xmath42 is not small enough to open a subgap from the direct overlap of states on opposite edges@xcite , as required by the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , under the effect of the superconducting pair @xmath22 , the evanescent nature of the wavefunctions along the transverse direction is sufficient to mediate a cooper pair forming@xcite , as long as the width is not much larger than the superconducting coherence length @xmath2 .",
    "notice that both competing effects ( intra - edge forward transport and inter - edge pairing ) are nonlocal in nature , which lead to a remarkable quantum interference throughout the central region , and finally result in the resonant competition between the ec and the car reaching the right lead .",
    "the reason for vanishing car process at @xmath43 is due to the opposite pseudoparities between the quantum channels in the leads and the central region which prohibits the scattering@xcite .",
    "the existence of this pseudoparity stems from the presence of the mirror reflection symmetry and the particle - hole symmetry of the bare hamiltonian , as well as the bipartite lattice structure of the lattice@xcite .",
    "finite @xmath19 breaks the particle - hole symmetry respect to the fermi energy , and relaxes the rigorous orthogonality between the scattering states , thus produces the possibility of nonzero @xmath32 .",
    "we have checked ( but not shown here ) that another way of breaking the particle - hole symmetry , including a small real - valued next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath44 can also induce nonzero car .",
    "later , we will see other examples of producing car by breaking the mirror reflection symmetry in section [ sectiondisorderjosephson ] .",
    "in order to have a deeper insight on the role of @xmath19 , in fig . [ figchargedensity ] ( a ) , we show the dependence of transmission coefficients on the onsite energy @xmath19 at a definite energy @xmath45 . in the large @xmath46 limit",
    ", the central region has been doped into the bulk band , and the dominating channel will be the ec for both spin components .",
    "for the spin down electron , this leads to the decrease of ar , whose perfectness was protected by the edge states .",
    "this is why the ar plateau starts to collapse when @xmath19 touches the gap edge at @xmath47 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior for spin up electron is more interesting for the oscillating patterns of @xmath28 and @xmath30 , which also reflects the coherent competition between the nonlocal edge transport and the nonlocal superconducting pairing .",
    "the highest peak of @xmath30 reaches a maximum value @xmath48 when @xmath49 , which is much larger than previously proposed@xcite .",
    "introducing some bulk states in the central region with @xmath50 was proposed to mediate inter - edge car@xcite , but we can see that too much bulk states at larger @xmath19 will destroy the above subtle coherent interference and provide more channels of transporting the electron directly to the right lead , which contribute to the ec . during this process , there may also be bulk mediated normal reflection , which makes @xmath51 .    for a visualized picture , we plot the real space charge distribution@xcite in the device in fig .",

    "some portion of the left lead ( labeled as `` left '' ) and the right lead ( labeled as `` right '' ) are also included in the plot . since there are no remarkable bulk states involved , the charge density is mostly distributed at the edges .",
    "however , because of coupling to the sc lead , the electron states in the ribbon acquire an evanescent character , and can spread over a length scale of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "there are hole states at the lower edge of right lead , corresponding to the car channel as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figschematic ] ( a ) .",

    "this fabry - perot - type resonance@xcite again reflects the coherent interference between two origins , the one - dimensional edge states and the inter - edge superconducting pairing via evanescent modes .",
    "another observation is that the envelopes of car and ec of spin up channel can last for a length much longer than the sc coherence length @xmath2 , compared to previous works@xcite .",
    "the reason should be ascribed to the remanent robustness of the edge states , and there is almost no bulk states here @xcite .",
    "as long as there are spin up states reaching the right boundary , the car can occur . however , in the limit of infinite length , both of car and ec decay to zero owing to the nonlocal but evanescent nature of the quasiparticles@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath29 is simply a plateau , since the ar is a local effect near the left boundary and has no dependence on its distance to the right boundary .    in fig .",
    "[ figlengthwidth ] ( b ) , transmission coefficients are plotted as functions of the ribbon width . when the ribbon is extremely narrow , @xmath29 ( red line ) is not quantized until @xmath55 , due to the direct and remarkable wavefunction overlapping of states from opposite edges@xcite .",

    "after that , the width dependence of @xmath30 is more interesting : @xmath30 has an optimal width with the largest value @xmath57 , and then decays to zero monotonically in the wide limit .",
    "this vanishing of car is not surprising as analysed above : the incoming electronic - like channel and the right emitting hole - like channel are in opposite edges of the device , and this evanescent state mediated scattering will be completely prohibited if they are sufficiently separated apart .",

    "these two methods break the mirror symmetry of the system . in realistic experiments",
    ", the silicene sample can hardly be perfectly mirror reflection symmetric , so the car should be easier to be observed .",

    "this also suggests that the car signals we discussed so far is expected to be observed in the presence of weak disorder .",
