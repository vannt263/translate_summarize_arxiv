    "following up the investigation of holonomy in the schwarzschild spacetime by rothman et al @xcite , maartens et al @xcite have extended the work in @xcite on closed circular trajectories to the kerr spacetime where the spacetime rotation further complicates matters by introducing new features .",
    "maartens et al @xcite study the parallel transport of a generic vector @xmath0 ( @xmath1 in their notation ) in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetime along the orbit of the spacelike killing vector associated with the axial symmetry . assuming the standard boyer - lindquist form of the kerr metric with @xmath2 , the time coordinate @xmath3 parametrizes each orbit of the stationary symmetry killing vector field @xmath4 and the azimuthal",
    "coordinate @xmath5 parametrizes each orbit of the axial killing vector @xmath6 .",
    "the transport equations reduce to a single fundamental second - order ordinary differential equation for the @xmath5-derivative of the @xmath3-component of @xmath0 [ eq : mmm ] + f^2 z = 0  , z=  , f^2= 1 - --  .",
    "[ eq : fundam ] recalling that @xmath7 is a constant along these orbits , this is trivially solved for @xmath8 , resulting in solutions characterized by a real or purely imaginary dimensionless frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the other components @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 itself are then easily calculated .",
    "maartens et al @xcite discuss the holonomy question by studying the behavior of these solutions , which clearly depends on the sign of the frequency - squared function @xmath14 , with the roots of the quartic equation @xmath15 in @xmath7 distinguishing oscillatory and exponential solutions of the system .",
    "they show that @xmath16 has exactly one positive root @xmath17 ( called @xmath18 in the schwarzschild discussion of rothman et al @xcite ) , but find no obvious significance for this value .",
    "when @xmath19 , which occurs for @xmath20 , rational values of the real frequency @xmath9 lead to the transported vector @xmath0 returning to its original value after a certain number of loops .",
    "here we show that @xmath21 and its sign have a geometrical significance directly associated with clock effects @xcite and then extend the study to the closed geodesic circuits associated with these clock effects and also studied by rothman et al @xcite for the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the results hold for any stationary axisymmetric spacetime for which clock effects can be studied .",
    "this requires the existence of pairs of oppositely - rotating timelike circular geodesics which intersect periodically , forming a double helix in spacetime contained within a single @xmath3-@xmath5 symmetry group orbit .    for a general family of stationary axisymmetric circularly - rotating observers , with an intermediate angular velocity between the two distinct angular velocities of such a pair of timelike circular geodesics within a given circular orbit cylinder ,",
    "if the two oppositely - rotating geodesics ( as seen by these observers ) depart from a given observer world line simultaneously , then they will in general not return to that world line simultaneously .",
    "instead there will be a proper time difference in their arrival times as measured by the observer clock .",
    "this is the observer - dependent single - clock clock effect , where the observer both defines the complete closed circuit and measures the difference in arrival times for it , interpreted as the difference in the observer - measured orbital periods .",
    "the observer - dependent two - clock clock effect is instead the difference in proper times elapsed on the clocks carried by the geodesics themselves for the same observer - defined circuit .",
    "finally the observer - independent two - clock clock effect is the difference in proper times elapsed on the clocks carried by these geodesics between three successive meeting points ; this effect is equivalent to the observer - dependent two - clock clock effect for the ` geodesic meeting point observers ' ( gmpos ) when the latter are timelike .",
    "the trajectories with constant angular velocity which pass through every other meeting point of the pair of geodesics are the geodesic meeting point ( gmp ) trajectories . when these trajectories are timelike , they define the world lines of the gmpos @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the zero @xmath17 of the frequency - squared function @xmath21 corresponds to the radius @xmath22 of the observer horizon for these gmpos .",
    "each such observer sees the pair of corotating and counter - rotating geodesics which leave it simultaneously also return simultaneously , and thus sees vanishing single - clock clock effect .",
    "this observer family has a number of special geometrical and kinematical properties and is also useful ( by definition ) in the discussion of the observer - independent two - clock clock effect . outside the radius @xmath17 , these observers are able to ` resist ' the clock effect by counter - rotating sufficiently fast to synchronize the geodesic arrival times , but within this radius the rotation of the spacetime itself is too great to overcome .",
    "the gmp trajectories are well - defined whether the circular geodesics are timelike , null or spacelike ; it is convenient to define their direction using their unit tangent when the tangent is non - null .",
    "only when timelike can these gmp trajectories be interpreted as the congruence of world lines of a test observer family .    the clock effect compares the spacetime arclength for different pairs of timelike paths between two spacetime points , each pair together forming a closed loop in spacetime .",
    "one can also compare parallel transport around such closed loops , investigating special elements of the holonomy group of the spacetime .",
    "this requires first solving the equations of parallel transport for a vector along a general circular orbit with constant angular velocity , which is done here . for comparison ,",
    "the simpler case of closed @xmath5-coordinate curves is studied , followed by the loops formed by the two oppositely - rotating timelike geodesics . in the first case",
    "the geometry depends crucially on the gmpos , while in the latter case both the gmpos and the carter observers come into play .",
    "the geometry of circular orbits and of the circular geodesics which give rise to both of these observer families requires preliminary study .",
    "the extremely accelerated observers @xcite also appear in this discussion as the only observers which see the parallel transport geometry symmetrically for pairs of orbits with equal magnitude but oppositely - signed relative velocities like the circular geodesics themselves .",
    "the holonomy invariance found at a dense subset of special radii and particular loop numbers for @xmath5-coordinate loops and geodesic loops in the static case @xcite and for @xmath5-coordinate loops in the stationary case @xcite and referred to as a ` band ' structure is reduced to a set of radii at most of measure zero for closed geodesic loops in the nonstatic case . in the kerr spacetime the dimensionless frequencies associated with parallel transport rotations can be expressed as ratios of the proper and average coordinate periods of the circular geodesics .",
    "establishing these results is an elegant exercise in geometry .",
    "the process of discovering them , however , initially required a computer algebra system to jumpstart the investigation and to derive certain consequences which could then be confirmed by hand .",
    "the entire discussion is a further example of how various geometrically defined circularly orbiting observer families continue to play a key role in understanding the geometry of stationary axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "consider the spacetime metric in symmetry - adapted coordinates s^2 = s^2_(t , ) + g_rrr^2 + g _ ^2  , with the metric of the circular orbit cylinder written respectively in coordinate and lapse - shift notation @xmath23 where in the case of kerr spacetime , @xmath24 are the usual boyer - lindquist coordinates adapted to the family of static observers , whose world lines are along the time coordinate lines , and to the zero angular momentum observers ( zamos ) , with 4-velocity @xmath25 and world lines orthogonal to the time coordinate hypersurfaces",

    "these radii densely cover the radial interval where the two circular geodesics are timelike , reproducing the band structure of holonomy invariance found for the closed @xmath5-coordinate loops .",
    "these geodesic gamma factors are distinct in the nonstatic case ( @xmath218 ) , where the condition that the separate rotations each return to the identity leads to two independent conditions rather than one as in the static case _ q = 2p _ _ = 2p_/q  , where now @xmath219 .",
    "in general it is not possible to satisfy both conditions at the same radius , although exceptional solutions of this type can occur at a set of radii of measure zero in the interval where both geodesics are timelike .",
    "this is clearly seen in the kerr spacetime case ( see fig .",
    "2 ) where as one increases the rotation parameter @xmath81 away from 0 , the graphs of @xmath188 versus @xmath7 move away on opposite sides from the schwarzschild graph .",
    "the counterrotating geodesic frequency curve moves to the right like the corresponding horizon @xmath220 of the counterrotating geodesics , while the cororating geodesic frequency curve moves to the left like the corresponding horizon @xmath221 of the corotating geodesics , with their zero values marking these two respective radii .",

    "however , for a given value of @xmath81 , there is no guarantee that even one such common radius exists .",
    "thus the band structure of holonomy invariance which exists for the static case does not exist in the nonstatic case , where it has instead been diluted by spreading out over the parameter interval of @xmath81 values , unlike the case @xmath226 , which all occur at the single value @xmath227 .",
    "a similar situation probably arises for other spacetimes of this clock - effect family .",
    "figure 3 illustrates this situation for the kerr frequency functions with @xmath228 compared to the schwarzschild case ( middle curve ) .",
    "the horizontal lines at @xmath229 illustrate either a @xmath230 circuit loop and @xmath231 or a @xmath232 circuit loop and @xmath233 .",
    "for example , the intersection points with the lines at @xmath234 mark the radii at which the parallel transport rotation separately returns to the identity compared to the spherical frame after an 8-circuit loop , in the process making @xmath235 revolutions with respect to that frame .",
    "one can see that the pair @xmath236 has already crossed at a smaller value of @xmath81 , while the pairs @xmath237 and @xmath238 have yet to cross for larger values of @xmath81 , all of which are easily found numerically .",
    "the real problem here is the boost between the local rest spaces of the pair of geodesics .",
    "if one were interested in comparing fermi - walker transport along curves modulo such boosts , then an analog of holonomy invariance still exists .",
    "fermi - walker transport along a timelike curve describes the behavior of the spin of a test gyroscope carried along such a world line , and reduces to parallel transport along a geodesic .",
    "spin vectors lie in the local rest space of the world line along which they travel , so to compare , at a spacetime point , spin vectors carried by observers in relative motion , one has to boost the spin vector from one observer to the other",
    ".    the degree to which this is physically interesting can be disputed , but if one accepts it mathematically , then one can parallel transport a spin vector around a closed geodesic loop like a baton in a relay race , passing off the baton from one geodesic to the other at the start and finish by a boost in order to make the comparison in the orientation of the spin direction without the relative motion distortion .",
    "for the case at hand , the boost comparison identifies the angular direction along @xmath5 in the local rest spaces ( namely @xmath239 ) , allowing one to ignore the fact that the rotations take place in different planes .    on",
    "the other hand one can imagine an experimental situation where each spin system is interrogated separately at the crossing event",
    ". then the final rotations will agree ( ignoring the boost ) if the two separate angles are the same mod @xmath205 after @xmath240 separate half - circuits ( joint whole circuits ) q _",

    "this leads to a situation analogous to the static case , but now including the odd values of the numerator @xmath141 .",
    "the average of the two individual angles instead gives the relative angle of their common direction ( modulo the boost ) with respect to the spherical frame at the meeting point 12[q _ ( geo)++(-q _ ( geo)- ) ] = 12 q_(dif ) = 12 q  , which is directly proportional to the fractional two - clock clock effect given by the ratio of ( [ eq:2c ] ) and ( [ eq:2period ] ) . the proportionality factor is just the frequency function @xmath109 for the @xmath5-coordinate circle discussion multiplied by @xmath242 .",
    "if one imagines a gedanken dual drag - free satellite gyroscope experiment with two oppositely - rotating equatorial plane geodesic orbits at the same radius , then it makes sense to assume that the internal spin up mechanisms would give the gyros the same spin magnitude in their rest frame relative to the satellite housing itself , which is presumably locked onto a distant guide star and hence to the local spherical frame in a calculable way . since each spin vector on these orbits precesses around an axis fixed with respect to the boosted spherical frame",
    ", one could compare the total angles of precession at meeting points with each other as well as with the local spherical frame , in which case the above mathematical considerations would come into play , including the use of boosts to compare orientations of gyros and axes in relative motion .",
    "these individual rotations of the spin vectors represent the combined geodetic and lense - thirring precession effects , which are aligned for these orbits , in contrast with slowly precessing polar orbits in the limit of small @xmath81 where they are orthogonal , as in the gp - b experiment @xcite .",
    "previous work on the holonomy associated with circular orbits in particular stationary axisymmetric spacetimes has been generalized to all those which admit clock effects , using the kerr spacetime as an illustrative example .",
    "the details of the calculations depend heavily on the geometry of the gmpos which are themselves defined by the geometry of clock effects .",
    "they directly determine the parallel transport transformations relative to the natural symmetry - adapted frame along the closed curves tangent to the killing vector associated with axial symmetry , and do the same in combination with the carter observers for general circular orbits . in the nonstatic case the band of holonomy invariance which exists for special geodesic clock - effect loops in the static case disappears .",
    "with some modifications , one can extend these parallel transport results to the case of spin precession to compare the total precession angles . in the kerr spacetime the dimensionless rotational frequencies associated with parallel transport rotations are particularly simple ratios of various circular geodesic period quantities .",
