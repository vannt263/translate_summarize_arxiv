    "qso0117 - 2837 ( 1e 0117.2 - 2837 ) was discovered as an x - ray source by _ einstein _ and is at a redshift of @xmath5=0.347 ( stocke et al .",
    "it is serendipituously located in a _",
    "pspc pointing .",
    "its x - ray spectrum is extremely steep , as was briefly noted by schwartz et al .",
    "we present here the first detailed analysis of the _ rosat _",
    "observations of this agn ( see komossa & fink 1997b for first results , and komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 for the complete ones ) , and a discussion of a high - quality optical spectrum .",
    "we have obtained an optical spectrum of qso0117 - 2837 with the eso1.52 m telescope at lasilla in september 1995 .",
    "the spectrum covers the wavelength range 3900 - 7800  with a resolution of 6 .",
    "the optical spectrum reveals several signs of a nlsy1 galaxy ( we do not distinguish between nl seyferts and nl quasars , here ) : weak [ oiii]@xmath65007 emission and strong feii complexes ( fig .",
    "after subtraction of the feii spectrum ( see grupe et al . 1999 for details ) we derive fwhm@xmath7=2100@xmath8 km / s , fwhm@xmath9}}$]=820@xmath10 km / s ( based upon single - component gaussian fits to the emission lines ) , and [ oiii]/h@xmath2=0.056 . alternatively , h@xmath2 was fit with a two - component gaussian in which case we obtain fwhm@xmath11 4000 km / s and fwhm@xmath12 @xmath13 1100 km / s .",
    "our spectrum also covers the important region around [ oii]@xmath63727 , which provides an important discriminant between different models to account for the excitation of the nlr in nlsy1s ( komossa & janek 1999 ) .",
    "[ oii ] is not detected , implying [ oii ] to be much weaker than [ oiii ] .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc observation of qso0117 - 2837 was performed in dec .",
    "1991 with an exposure time of 4.5 ksec .",
    "the source is detected with a countrate of 0.44 cts / s ( see komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 for further details on x - ray data reductions carried out ) . 0.2 cm    _ spectral analysis .",
    "_ the _ rosat _ x - ray spectrum of qso0117 - 2837 is extremely steep .",
    "three models provide a successful spectral fit ; we discuss each in turn :    \\(i ) when the x - ray spectrum is fit by a single powerlaw with galactic cold absorption of @xmath14 @xmath15 , we derive a photon index @xmath0 @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , if @xmath18 is treated as free parameter ) .",
    "the overall quality of the fit is good ( @xmath19 ) , but slight systematic residuals remain ( fig .",
    "\\(ii ) a successful alternative description is a _ warm - absorbed _ flat powerlaw of fixed canonical index @xmath0 = 1.9 .",
    "the warm absorber models are based on ferland s ( 1993 ) code _ cloudy _ , and the model assumptions and calculations are described in more detail in komossa & fink ( e.g. , 1997a ) .",
    "we find a very large column density of the warm absorber , and the contribution of emission and reflection is no longer negligible ; there is also some contribution to fe k@xmath20 . for the pure absorption model ,",
    "the best - fit values for ionization parameter and warm column density are @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( @xmath18 is now consistent with the galactic value when treated as free parameter ) , with @xmath23=0.7 . including the contribution of emission and reflection for 50% covering of the warm material as calculated with",
    "_ cloudy _ gives @xmath24 ( @xmath23 = 0.65 ) .",
    "several strong euv emission lines are predicted to arise from the warm material ( e.g. , fexxi@xmath62304/h@xmath25 = 10 , neviii@xmath6774/h@xmath25 = 9 , and fexxii@xmath6846/h@xmath25 = 113 ) .",
    "no absorption from civ and nv is expected to show up in the uv .",
    "both elements are more highly ionized .",
    "\\(iii ) thirdly , the spectrum can be fit with a flat powerlaw ( @xmath0 fixed to 1.9 ) plus soft excess which was parameterized as black body , or the standard accretion - disk emission model available in exsas .",
    "we find @xmath26 kev for the black body description ( @xmath23=0.7 ) .",
    "using the accretion disk description , and fixing the black hole mass to @xmath27 yields @xmath28 = 0.6 .",
    "0.2 cm    _ temporal analysis . _",
    "an analysis of the temporal variability reveals _ constant _ source flux within the 1@xmath29 error during the observation .",
    "this makes qso0117 - 2837 another example of a nlsy1 with constant x - ray flux during the time - interval of observation , showing that _ not all _",
    "nlsy1s are characterized by permanent rapid variability ( see also the discussion and examples in wisotzki & bade 1997 ) .",
    "-6.3 cm    -0.5 cm",
    "given the rather large width of h@xmath2 , the x - ray spectrum of qso0117 - 2837 is exceptionally steep ; among the steepest observed in nlsy1s . in fact , whereas there is a very large scatter in the x - ray spectral steepness of nlsy1s , with several as flat as normal seyferts ( e.g. , xu et al .",
    "1999 ) , broad line objects always tend to show flat x - ray spectra ( e.g. , boller et al . 1996 , grupe et al . 1999 ) ; the corresponding region in the fwhm@xmath4@xmath0 diagram is occasionally referred to as ` zone of avoidance ' .",
    "qso0117 - 2837 appears to be an important transition object : depending on which representation of the line profile is chosen  a one - component gaussian with fwhm@xmath4=2100 km / s , or a two component gaussian which gives a better fit and fwhm@xmath30=4000",
    "km / s  qso0117 - 2837 is placed at the border of the ` zone of avoidance ' , or inside it , respectively .",
    "the origin of the steep observed x - ray spectra of nlsy1 galaxies and the relation to their optical properties is still not well understood . in particular , it is interesting to point out the following : whereas among the early suggestions to explain the x - ray spectral steepness of nlsy1s was the presence of a strong soft excess , in analogy to ` normal ' seyferts and quasars that were believed to show a soft excess , there is now growing evidence that many soft excesses in seyferts were in fact mimicked by the presence of warm absorbers . on the other hand , the soft excesses in nlsy1s ,",
    "although originally inferred in analogy to seyferts , turn out to be real , as judged by recent _",
    "asca _ and _ sax _ observations ( e.g. , vaughan et al .",
    "often , it turns out , several components are simultaneously present that contribute to the spectral steepness in nlsy1s : a steeper - than - usual powerlaw , a soft excess _ and _ a warm absorber pointing to the spectral complexity in these objects ( see , e.g. , the discussion in komossa & fink 1997a , b ) .    in the case of qso0117 - 2837 the limited _ rosat _",
    "spectral resolution does not allow us to distinguish between models ( i)-(iii ) of sect .",
    "3 . it still allows to determine the maximal possible contribution of each component ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "in fact , the rather large inferred column density @xmath31 of the warm absorber ( model ii ) suggests that further mechanisms contribute to , or dominate , the x - ray steepness .",
    "given the very steep rise towards the blue of qso0117 - 2837 s optical spectrum ( with @xmath32=0.0 , grupe et al .",
    "1998 ) , it is tempting to speculate that a giant soft - excess dominates the optical - to - x - ray spectrum .",
    "we strongly caution , though , that simultaneous optical - x - ray variability studies in other seyferts and nlsy1s ( e.g. , done et al .",
    "1995 ) do _ not _ favor a common origin of x - ray and optical components .",
    "secondly , one giant optical - to - x - ray bump seems to be inconsistent with the finding of rodriguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that nlsy1s tend to be underluminous in the uv .",
    "the possibility of an _ indirect _ relation between optical and x - ray component remains .",
    "given the abundant presence of warm absorbers in ` normal seyferts ' , and the additional trend that warm absorbers are more abundant in feii - strong objects ( wang et al .",
    "1996 ) , combined with qso0117 - 2837 s large fwhm@xmath4 and steep x - ray spectrum , it is likely that both , a soft excess and a warm absorber contribute to its spectral steepness in the _ rosat _ band .",
    "its peculiar optical  x - ray properties make the quasar a good target for ( a ) follow - up x - ray spectral observations with , e.g. , _ xmm _ , and ( b ) high - resolution optical studies of the h@xmath2 profile ."
