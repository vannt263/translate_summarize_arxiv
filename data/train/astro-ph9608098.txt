    "faraday rotation acts also as a depolarizing mechanism .",
    "if an extended source emits polarized radiation , the total outcome may become significantly depolarized by a magnetic field , after the radiation emanating from points at different depths within the source experience different amounts of faraday rotation .",
    "this process affects significantly the radio emission of galaxies and quasars @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the depolarizing effect exerted by a primordial magnetic field upon the cmb across the last scattering surface .",
    "we consider a robertson - walker universe with scalar , energy - density fluctuations , and assume a standard thermal history .",
    "we make use of an analytic approach @xcite , based on a recent refinement and extension @xcite of the tight - coupling approximation @xcite , that highlights the physical process responsible for the cmb polarization and its dependence upon various cosmological parameters , while still yielding reasonably accurate results .",
    "the polarization of the cmb is proportional to the width of the last scattering surface ( lss ) , the interval of time during which most of the cmb photons that we observe today last - scattered off free electrons .",
    "a primordial magnetic field could prevent the polarization from growing across the full width of the lss .",

    "the impact of depolarization upon anisotropy comes about as a consequence of the polarization - dependence of thomson scattering , which feeds back polarization into anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the dominant effect is a reduction in the exponential damping due to photon diffusion , which results in an increase of the anisotropy at those frequencies for which depolarization is significant .",

    "as expected , the effect is larger on smaller angular scales ( larger @xmath184 ) .",
    "the numerical result approximately follows the analytic estimate of the effect of the reduction in diffusion damping . the total effect , however , does not increase monotonically with @xmath184 .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the nature of the subdominant quadrupole contribution @xmath94 , which oscillates out of phase with the @xmath163 s @xcite ( remember that @xmath185 ) , and is reduced by depolarization through a factor @xmath186 .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "4 that the analytic result for the change in diffusion damping due to depolarization overestimates the total effect at high l. this is because the actual damping in the @xmath163 spectra has two contributions , one from silk damping and the other due to cancellations in the integral across the last scattering surface produced by the oscillations in the exponential and sources in equation ( [ tformal ] ) .",
    "only silk damping is reduced by the magnetic field , and that is why equation ( [ delta ] ) slightly overestimates the net effect .",
    "the analytic and numeric calculations are in very good agreement around @xmath2 .",
    "the frequency - dependence of @xmath169 at @xmath170 plotted in fig .",
    "2 fits very well the analogous result after the full numerical integration of the boltzmann equations .",
    "we conclude that the depolarizing effect of the magnetic field results in an increase of the anisotropy correlation function multipoles of up to 7.5% ( for sufficiently low frequencies ) on small angular scales ( @xmath2 ) , those that will be accessible by future cmb satellite experiments such as map and cobras / samba .",
    "the frequencies at which the effect is significant , however , depend on the strength and coherence length of the primordial magnetic field at the time of recombination .",
    "depolarization depending upon frequency , the effect might be difficult to separate from foreground contamination .",
    "the relative change of the @xmath163 s at @xmath170 is larger than 2% on frequencies below 30 ghz ( accessible to the first two channels in map ) , if @xmath187 gauss or larger . the first two channels in cobras / samba being at 31.5 and 53 ghz , the signal would reach a 2% level within this range only if @xmath1 is around or larger than 0.1 gauss",
    "however , cobras / samba might reach out to larger values of @xmath184 , where @xmath169 is larger , and might thus have a sensitivity to the depolarizing effect of @xmath1 comparable to map . in any case , both experiments will be sensitive to a magnetic field around @xmath1=0.1 gauss , and would thus at least be able to place a direct constraint on @xmath1 comparable or better than the one obtained from extrapolation of the nucleosynthesis bound .",
    "experiments searching cmb anisotropy and polarization at smaller frequencies , which currently operate down to 5 ghz @xcite , may play a significant role to detect the depolarizing effect of a primordial magnetic field .",
    "the cmb is expected to have a small degree of linear polarization .",
    "several estimates were made for the predicted polarization , both in the context of anisotropic cosmological models @xcite , as well as in isotropic and homogeneous cosmologies perturbed with either energy - density fluctuations or gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the polarization of the cmb remains undetected , its upper limit being @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a primordial magnetic field depolarizes the cmb radiation on those frequencies that experience a significant amount of faraday rotation around the time of decoupling . in this paper , we have applied the analytic method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to estimate the depolarizing effect of a primordial magnetic field across the last - scattering surface , assuming a standard ionization history .",
    "the result is expressed by eqs .",
    "( [ d(f)],[dlow],[dlarge ] ) and is represented in fig .",
    "1 . the cmb becomes significantly depolarized at frequencies around and below 30 ghz @xmath188 , below which the degree of polarization decreases quadratically with frequency .",
    "@xmath1 is the value of the primordial field at a redshift @xmath19 , around recombination , likely to be @xmath189 times larger than an hypothetical cosmological magnetic field at present times .",
    "the average depolarizing factor depends only upon the parameter @xmath16 , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ fbis ] ) , which represents the average faraday rotation between collisions .",
    "we have calculated the depolarizing factor @xmath190 , as given by equation ( [ d(f ) ] ) , in the particular case of a wavevector @xmath101 . in a general case ,",
    "the factor @xmath100 depends upon the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath6 .",
    "this dependence integrates away in average quantities , after the stochastic superposition of all fourier modes of the density fluctuations .",
    "the value derived here for @xmath100 is at most an underestimate of the average depolarizing effect , which would eventually start to be significant at slightly larger frequencies .",
    "our derivation also assumed that faraday rotation accumulates over the width of the last scattering surface .",
    "if the primordial magnetic field is very entangled over that scale , the depolarizing effect starts to be significant at smaller frequencies .",
    "the depolarizing mechanism has a significant effect upon the anisotropy of the cmb on small angular scales . on those angular scales and at frequencies such that the depolarizing effect is large , the damping of anisotropies by photon diffusion is reduced , which results in a significant increase of the anisotropy at a fixed angular scale . besides , depolarization reduces the contribution of the intrinsic quadrupole anisotropy .",
    "figure 2 displays the estimate for the percentual change of the anisotropy power spectrum at @xmath170 due to the reduction in diffusion damping , as a function of frequency and for different values of the primordial magnetic field at recombination .",
    "we conclude that a primordial magnetic field increases the anisotropy of the cmb by up to 7.5% at @xmath2 in a standard cdm cosmology .",
    "the asymptotic strength of the effect is independent of the intensity of the magnetic field , but the frequencies at which it starts to be significant are those around and below 30 ghz @xmath191",
    ". measurements of anisotropy and polarization at sufficiently low frequencies could probe primordial magnetic fields in an interesting range .",
