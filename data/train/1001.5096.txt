    "most of the x - ray bright agn in our nearby universe ( @xmath5 ) are either bulge dominated early type galaxies or disk galaxies that have recently undergone minor mergers or bar instabilities ( georgakakis et al .",
    "2009 ; gabor et al . 2009 ; pierce et al .",
    "the latter processes are accompanied by vigorous star formation and gas infall towards the nucleus .",
    "hence the host galaxies are optically bright and their nuclei often show strong agn activity ( ho et al .",
    "late type spiral galaxies are however not as bright as early type galaxies .",
    "they are generally poor in star formation and if agn activity is present , it is usually weak ( ho 2008 ) .",
    "the nuclear activity of such late type systems are not as well studied or understood as those found in bright galaxies .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the x - ray spectrum of an extreme type of late type spiral galaxy , a low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxy .",
    "these galaxies are poorly evolved , halo dominated systems and have diffuse , optically dim disks ( impey & bothun 1997 ) .",
    "agn have been detected in their nuclei at optical wavelengths ( sprayberry et al .",
    "1995 ; impey , burkholder & sprayberry 2001 ) , at radio frequencies ( das et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) and in x - ray emission ( das et al .",
    "agn in lsb galaxies are usually associated with bulge dominated lsb galaxies ( schombert 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of lsb galaxies are relatively unexplored .",
    "a recent chandra study of eight giant lsb galaxies detected x - ray emission from the agn in two galaxies ( das et al .",
    "2009a ) as well as diffuse emission associated with the bulge in four of the eight sources . to date only two lsb galaxies have been observed by _ xmm - newton _ , ugc  6614 and f568 - 6 ( malin  2 ) .",
    "of the two , ugc  6614 has an x - ray bright core . in f568 - 6 , only a very faint x - ray source was detected in the xmm - newton image ; the faintness is probably due to the larger distance of the galaxy ( @xmath6 ) compared to that of ugc  6614 ( @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the luminosity distance of the galaxy ) .",
    "this paper presents the first study of the nuclear x - ray spectrum of an lsb galaxy .",
    "x - ray imaging studies of lsb galaxies have been done earlier ( das et al .",
    "2009 ) , but x - ray spectroscopic studies have not been done before . using _",
    "xmm - newton _ archival data we present a study of the nuclear x - ray spectrum of ugc  6614 which is a prototypical giant lsb galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is close to face on and has a prominent bulge surrounded by a ring like feature ( rahman et al . 2007 ;",
    "hinz et al . 2007 ) .",
    "its optical spectrum shows a broad @xmath9 line typical of a seyfert 1 nucleus ( schombert 1998 ) .",
    "it has a bright nucleus at millimeter and centimeter radio wavelengths ( das et al .",
    "2006 ; 2009b ) .",
    "the optical r band image of the galaxy with the contours of x - ray emission overlaid is shown in figure  1 and the galaxy parameters are listed in table  1 . in the following sections we describe our analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of the x - ray spectrum of ugc  6614 .",
    "we use the latter to estimate the black hole mass associated with the agn and in the last section we discuss the implications of our results .",
    ".parameters of ugc  6614 [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      source and background spectra , response files and the effective area files for each of the three detectors were generated as described above .",
    "the source spectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin to improve the statistics and ensure the validity of the @xmath10 test .",
    "the spectral fitting was performed with the xspec package ( v11 ) .",
    "after appropriate background subtraction , simultaneous spectral fitting was done using the mos1 , mos2 , and pn spectra .",
    "all the spectral parameters other than the relative normalization , were tied toegther for all three detectors .",
    "we fitted the 0.1 - 10.0 kev spectra with a power - law continuum component modified with interstellar absorption .",
    "the model was found to be statistically acceptable with a reduced @xmath10 of 1.1 for 225 degrees of freedom .",
    "the value of the @xmath11 was found to be @xmath02 @xmath1 10@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 , which is similar to that of the galactic value in the source direction .",
    "therefore , we fixed the value of @xmath11 at the galactic value ( 1.93 @xmath1 10@xmath12 atoms @xmath13 ) and estimated the best - fit parameters .",
    "the energy spectrum of the source along with the residuals to the best - fit model is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the spectral parameters of the best - fit model obtained from the simultaneous spectral fitting are given in table 3 .",
    "ll power - law index ( @xmath14 ) & 1.81@xmath150.02 + absorption uncorrected source flux@xmath16 & 1.03@xmath150.02 + absorption corrected source flux@xmath16 & 1.13@xmath150.02 + reduced @xmath10 & 1.1 ( 297 dof ) +   +   +    [ spec_par ]",
    "the main result of this paper is that although ugc  6614 is a lsb galaxy , it hosts an agn whose x - ray charactersitics are similar to those found in more evolved star forming galaxies and seyfert galaxies . in the following paragraphs",
    "we discuss the implications of our results .    *",
    "( i ) an x - ray bright agn in a lsb galaxy  :  * + the nucleus of ugc  6614 has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath17 .",
    "this is similar to the x - ray emission observed from another giant lsb galaxy , ugc  2936 ( @xmath18 ; das et al .",
    "the flux is also comparable to the nuclear x - ray flux of nearby disk galaxies ( georgakakis et al . 2009 ) .",
    "further , like most of the seyfert galaxies , ugc  6614 shows significant x - ray variability on short timescales ( turner et al .",
    "this strongly indicates the presence of an active nucleus in ugc  6614 . as mentioned earlier in section  1 , the nucleus of ugc  6614 is also bright at radio and optical frequencies .",
    "the radio spectrum is flat between 1.4  ghz to 110  ghz and the emission is compact in morphology ( das et al .",
    "2006 ) and only at lower radio frequencies ( 610  mhz ) does it appear extended as radio lobes or jets ( das et al .",
    "thus , although ugc  6614 is a low luminosity galaxy whose evolution is slowed down by the presence of a dominant dark halo , its agn characteristics are similar to more evolved , star forming galaxies .    *",
    "( ii )  x - ray variability and bh mass  :  * + the x - ray emission shows variability at short time scales .",
    "intraday x - ray variability has been observed in most quasars and agns ( e.g. markowitz & edelson 2001 ; uttley , mc hardy & papadakis 2002 ) , while some agns also show variability down to time scale of minutes ( e.g. mcg-6 - 30 - 15 : miniutti et al .",
    "the short variability time scale has strong implications ; it restricts the size of the emission region and is also related to efficiency of the central engine . the large amplitude , short time scale x - ray variability of ugc  6614 , indicates an accreting black hole as the source of nuclear energy in this galaxy . if the x - ray variability mechanism in ugc  6614 and nearby seyfert galaxies is the same , then , using the method of nikolajuk et al . ( 2004 ) , we estimated that the mass of the central black hole is @xmath19 10@xmath20m@xmath21 .",
    "this is similar to the black hole mass determined in several low luminosity seyfert - like active galaxies , such as , the late type spiral galaxy ngc  4395 ( vaughan et al .",
    "2005 ) , the dwarf elliptical pox 52 ( barth et al .",
    "2004 ) and the dwarf seyfert 1 sdss j160531.84 + 174826.1 ( dong et al .",
    "however , an approximate estimate of @xmath22 the from the h@xmath23 line luminosity and linewidth relation ( greene & ho 2007 ) gives a value of @xmath24 10@xmath25m@xmath21 ( das et al .",
    "2009a ) , which is much higher than that derived from the x - ray variability .",
    "both methods are approximate and have large dispersions in the black hole mass .",
    "but the h@xmath23 observations are very poor in resolution ( sprayberry et al . 1995 ) and can be considerably improved .",
    "in fact the larger @xmath22 value is only an upper limit for the mass .",
    "this is supported by recent h@xmath23 spectroscopic observations of the nucleus of this galaxy ( ramya et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "the eddington luminosity correpsonding to @xmath19 10@xmath20m@xmath21 is @xmath26 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is already 10% of the eddington limit for this black hole mass .",
    "vasudevan & fabian ( 2009 ) reported a range of 15 to 150 for the bolometric correction in agns depending on the eddington ratio .",
    "thus the mass of the black hole in ugc  6614 is quite likely to be more than the nominal value determined from excess variance . in absence of a knowledge about the sed of this object",
    ", we can not obtain a more definite estimate for the black hole mass .    *",
    "( iii )  implications for galaxy evolution  :  * + although the existence of agn and black holes ( bhs ) in giant lsb galaxies has been known for some time , their properties are not well understood .",
    "some studies suggest that their black hole mass and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath27 ) relation is different from ellipticals and high surface brightness galaxies ( pizzella et al .",
    "they also appear to lie off the radio - x - ray fundamental plane ( das et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , more detailed studies are required to understand the nuclear properties of these galaxies .",
    "as mentioned earlier giant lsb galaxies have optically dim disks but prominent bulges which often host relatively bright agn .",
    "this suggests that the bulge and agn evolved independently of the halo dominated disks .",
    "this decoupled disk - nuclear evolution is unlike what we see in nearby star forming spirals where the bulge - agn evolution is related to the secular evolution of the galaxy as a whole ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "this type of bulge - agn evolution does not fit into our present picture of galaxy evolution . to understand it requires a deeper study of the agn characteristics and star formation history of ugc  6614 .",
    "the authors thank the referee for his valuable suggestions that helped us to improve the content of this paper .",
    "we would like to thank alice quillen for providing the r band image of ugc  6614 .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with xmm - newton , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "we have also used the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "the research work at physical research laboratory is funded by the department of space , government of india .",
