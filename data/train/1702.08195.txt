    "theoretical studies of the linearly polarized gluon distribution indicate that it can be quite sizable compared to the unpolarized gluon distribution . in the dglap formalism",
    "its small-@xmath2 asymptotic behavior is the same as the unpolarized gluon distribution , implying that grows equally rapidly towards small @xmath2 . in the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model  @xcite that describes gluon saturation at small @xmath2 , it has been found  @xcite that the linearly polarized gluon distribution inside a large nucleus ( or nucleon ) reaches its maximal value allowed by the positivity constraint for transverse momenta above the saturation scale @xmath9 . at low transverse momentum ,",

    "the process under consideration in the present paper probes the dipole type tmds , for which the linear gluon polarization is expected to become maximal at small @xmath2 .    to reliably extract small-@xmath2 gluon tmds in high energy scattering ,",
    "it is of great importance to first establish tmd factorization . as a leading power approximation , tmd factorization",
    "is usually expected to hold at moderate to large @xmath2  @xcite . at small @xmath2",
    ", however , higher twist contributions are equally important as the leading twist contribution because of the high gluon density . in order to arrive at an effective tmd factorization at small @xmath2 ,",
    "one first has to calculate the complete hard scattering cross section in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework , which is expressed as the convolution of hard part and wilson lines .",
    "the next step is to extrapolate the full cgc result to the correlation limit where the gluon transverse momentum is much smaller than the hard scale(s ) in the process .",
    "one can then justify the use of tmd factorization at small @xmath2 , by reducing the complete cgc result to the cross section formula derived in tmd factorization .",

    "the back - to - back correlation limit is essential here , because only in this limit one finds a full match between the cgc result and the effective tmd factorization  @xcite .",
    "we will present some technical details in the next section showing how to extrapolate the cgc result to the correlation limit .",
    "however , this is not yet the complete story . due to the fact that there exists two",
    "well separated scales @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the process under consideration , improving the perturbative calculation in a systemic way requires to resum to all orders the large logarithms @xmath21 that show up in higher order corrections .",

    "@xcite that the polarization dependent five - dimensional _ generalized _ tmd inside a large nucleus could be sizable .",

    "the virtual photon - jet production in the forward region in @xmath1 collision is dominated by the partonic process , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is understood as the total momentum transfer through multiple gluon exchange when a quark from proton scattering off the gluon background inside a large nucleus .",
    "typically one computes the cross section for this process using a hybrid approach  @xcite in which the dense target nucleus is treated as a cgc , while on the side of dilute projectile proton one uses the ordinary integrated parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "although a general proof of this method is still lacking , from a practical point of view such a hybrid approach is very useful and we will employ it here .",
    "problematic contributions causing a violation of ( generalized ) tmd factorization  @xcite are absent in this formalism .",
    "this is because one still can employ the ward identity argument to decouple longitudinal gluon attachments from the proton side like in collinear factorization .",
    "put differently , the factorization breaking terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath25 in the semi - hard region where the imbalance transverse momentum of the virtual photon - jet system is of the order of the saturation scale @xmath9 . for more detailed arguments why the factorization breaking effects can be avoided in the semi - hard region , we refer readers to refs .",

    "these interactions are summarized into wilson lines which stretch from minus infinity to plus infinity .",

    "multiple exchanges are power suppressed .",
    "this corresponds to a taylor expansion of the hard part , @xmath35 where the first term does not contribute and the neglected terms are suppressed by powers of @xmath36 .",

    "effectively it means that in the correlation limit the incoming quark no longer interacts coherently with the nucleus throughout the process , but that the leading power effect of the interactions with the classical gluonic state are restricted to before and after the hard scattering .",
    "the net effect is an @xmath39 color rotation of the incoming quark and the outgoing quark - virtual photon system that is encoded in the gauge links of the tmd .",

    "<S> we perform a phenomenological analysis of the @xmath0 azimuthal asymmetry in virtual photon plus jet production induced by the linear polarization of gluons in unpolarized @xmath1 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although the linearly polarized gluon distribution becomes maximal at small @xmath2 , tmd evolution leads to a sudakov suppression of the asymmetry with increasing invariant mass of the @xmath3-jet pair . employing a small-@xmath2 model input distribution , </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry is found to be strongly suppressed under tmd evolution , but still remains sufficiently large to be measurable in the typical kinematical region accessible at rhic or lhc at moderate photon virtuality , whereas it is expected to be negligible in @xmath4-jet pair production at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the optimal kinematics for rhic and lhc studies , in order to expedite the first experimental studies of the linearly polarized gluon distribution through this process . </S>",
    "<S> we further argue that this is a particularly clean process to test the @xmath5-resummation formalism in the small-@xmath2 regime . </S>"
