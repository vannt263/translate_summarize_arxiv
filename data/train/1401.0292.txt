    "even though there have been many positive hints of the possible existence of sterile neutrinos and small unitarity violation in the mnsp matrix from both the theoretical and the experimental sides , there is currently no definite constraint on the mass of these particles .",
    "it is one of the important jobs to determine or constrain the number of sterile neutrinos and their mass and mixing properties in future precision experiments .",
    "the existence of sterile neutrinos can produce various kinds of effects on neutrino oscillations depending on the properties of the sterile neutrinos ( e.g. , the scale of the sterile neutrino mass , the magnitude and the structure of the active - sterile mixing ) as well as the configurations of the experiments ( e.g. , the oscillation channel , the energy spectrum of the neutrino flux , the baseline @xmath28 , whether the matter effect need to be taken into account ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the possibility of searching for sub - ev sterile neutrinos in the precision reactor antineutrino oscillation experiments with three different baselines at around 500 m , 2 km and 60 km respectively .",
    "the strategy of placing functionally identical detectors at different baselines and carrying out a combined analysis can offer a  clean \" measurement of the electron antineutrino survival probabilities which is cp - phases independent as well as antineutrino flux independent .",
    "we found that the active - sterile mixing angle @xmath0 could be determined or constrained by the precision measurement of the relative event rate @xmath122 , provided that @xmath99 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 were well determined .",
    "the mass - squared difference @xmath1 could be obtained from the fourier transformation to the @xmath2 spectrum at the near detector .",
    "we underline that the antineutrino survival probabilities obtained in reactor experiments are sensitive only to the direct unitarity violation which is induced by the existence of light sterile neutrinos but independent of the indirect unitarity violation parameters .",
    "more specifically , the reactor experiments offer very concentrated sensitivity only to two of the direct unitarity violation parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this means if any signals of unitarity violation are observed , we can then draw some definite informations on the mass and mixing properties of the light sterile neutrinos . on the contrary , if no observable effect of the unitarity violation are found in the reactor experiments , strong constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 should be obtained without the possibilities of cancelations between different unitarity violation effects .    surely , for such measurements to succeed , both the high energy resolution and the large statistics are essentially important . with the aim of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy , the upcoming juno experiment plan to build a 20 kton liquid scintillator detector of the @xmath142 energy resolution at about 52 km from reactors of total thermal power 36 gw .",
    "to find out the accurate possibility of searching sub - ev sterile neutrinos in this kind of precision reactor experiment , a detailed @xmath157 analysis that incorporates available information from experiments and all other uncertainties is need .",
    "also , accurate informations on the standard mass and mixing parameters are crucial for determining the unitarity violation parameters .",
    "the global analysis of various oscillation experiments are highly required for the complete determination of the full mass and mixing pattern of the active and sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank z. z. xing and y. f. li for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no .",
    "in this appendix , we consider a more general ( @xmath10+@xmath11+@xmath15 ) scenario , in which @xmath11 light sterile neutrino @xmath13 and @xmath15 heavy sterile neutrinos @xmath158 , @xmath159 , ... , @xmath160 are added to the standard three active neutrinos framework . in the ( @xmath10+@xmath11+@xmath15 ) scenario ,",
    "the full picture of the neutrino mixing should be described by a @xmath161 unitary matrix @xmath17 @xmath162 where @xmath163 . in this scenario",
    ", there are all together @xmath164 independent mixing parameters ( including @xmath165 mixing angles and @xmath166 phases ) and @xmath6 neutrino masses .",
    "however , for low energy experiments , no matter how large @xmath167 is , only the elements in the @xmath168 left - up sub - matrix @xmath169 of @xmath17 are related to the neutrino oscillation probabilities : @xmath170 here @xmath169 is in general non - unitary and consist of at most 24 independent real parameters ( some unphysical phases are also counted ) . which means for any @xmath171 , neutrino oscillation probabilities for any low energy experiments",
    "can all be effectively parametrized by 24 independent mixing parameters and 3 independent mass - squared differences . in the special case of @xmath172",
    ", @xmath169 can be parametrised by only 16 independent mixing parameters ( 10 mixing angles and 6 phases ) as we have explained in sec .",
