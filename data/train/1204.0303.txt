    "inflation generates the source of the large - scale perturbation that is needed to explain the inhomogeneity and the structure of the universe @xcite . in the original scenario of the inflationary universe , the adiabatic mode of the inflaton fluctuation sources the curvature perturbation when the perturbation leaves the horizon .",
    "however , if there are many light scalar fields during inflation , inflation may create isocurvature perturbations for these fields , and those isocurvature perturbations may cause significant creation of the curvature perturbation after the horizon exit .    the generation of the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation @xcite is basically caused by ( 1 ) modulation of the coupling constants or ( 2 ) two - field hybrid inflation in which both inflaton fields are coupled to the waterfall field .",
    "one thing that is common in the previous models of the `` end of inflation '' scenario is that * the extra light field has an explicit coupling to the inflaton sector * @xcite .",
    "one might think that this requirement is essential and quite obvious ; however _ we are considering in this paper the removal of this basic requirement .",
    "_ in our model the additional fields are not coupled to the inflaton sector , but it changes the definition of the adiabatic field . as a result ,",
    "the inflation end is not identical to the uniform density hypersurfaces .",
    "first consider a model in which the inflaton @xmath0 and the waterfall field @xmath1 have the hybrid - type potential given by @xmath2 this defines the `` inflaton sector '' of the model .",
    "suppose that inflation starts with @xmath3 , and the end of inflation is defined by @xmath4 , where the waterfall begins .",
    "the critical point @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 the number of e - foldings is given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the slow - roll parameter defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble parameter during inflation and the subscript means the derivative with respect to the field .",
    "in the single - field inflation model we always find the trivial coincidence between the uniform density hypersurfaces and the end of inflation . in that case",
    ", one can not find the perturbation @xmath11 created at the end  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath11 measures the discrepancy between the uniform density hypersurfaces and the end of inflation .",
    "going back to the past model  @xcite , generation of the perturbation at the end of inflation is considered for a two - field model . in that case",
    "the additional light field is coupled to the waterfall field and that causes @xmath12 at the end .",
    "namely , if one introduces another inflaton @xmath13 that has the same interaction as the primary field @xmath14 , the end of inflation depends on @xmath13 as ; @xmath15 then , suppose that @xmath13 is much lighter than @xmath14 , the entropy perturbation @xmath16 creates the perturbation @xmath17 at the end .",

    ", we consider a similar mechanism of generating curvature perturbation at the end of inflation , _ but in contrast to the usual scenario , the additional fields are decoupled from the inflaton sector_.    keeping the inflaton @xmath0 in the potential given by eq.([base - pot ] ) , we introduce * free * light fields ( @xmath19 ) , which have no explicit interaction with the waterfall field @xmath1 .",
    "although these fields ( @xmath19 ) are not coupled to the `` inflaton sector '' , they must participate in the definition of the adiabatic inflaton field ; @xmath20 , which is mandatory .",

    "the angled trajectory ( @xmath24 ) causes significant creation of the curvature perturbation at the end .",
    "one might be skeptical about the generation of the curvature perturbation at the end , if it is realized just by adding free scalar fields to the model . to illustrate what happens in this model",
    ", we show the simplest calculation , in which one `` standard '' inflaton @xmath0 and one additional light field @xmath25 have the same quadratic potential with the same mass @xmath26 .",

    "the spectral index is obviously different from the standard hybrid inflation scenario .",
    "_    using the second order perturbation , we can estimate the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 suggest @xmath54 . here",
    "the definition of @xmath55 is @xmath56 where a subscript @xmath57 denotes the derivative with respect to the @xmath57-th field , and `` @xmath58 '' includes loop corrections that are usually negligible .",
    "since @xmath55 is obviously small for the quadratic potential , in which @xmath59 is mandatory , we need to consider non - quadratic potential for the enhancement .    one way to enhance @xmath55 is to consider the effective potential that is dominated by the higher polynomial ; @xmath60 this potential may allow @xmath61 , which makes it possible to find @xmath45 and @xmath62 at the same time .",
    "if there are @xmath63 light scalar fields ( @xmath19 , @xmath64 ) in the inflationary universe , a naive statistical expectation is @xmath65 . to avoid the significant creation of @xmath11 at the end , these scalar fields must be settled in their minima before the end of inflation , or should have very flat potential compared with the inflaton , so that @xmath66 is a plausible approximation during inflation .",
    "if there are too many fields in the universe , n - flation @xcite may start before the onset of hybrid inflation . then hybrid inflation may begin when @xmath67 starts dominating the universe .",
    "above we considered the simplest set - up for the model , in which only one field ( adiabatic field ) appears in the effective potential during inflation , while the end is caused by the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". however , in more general cases there may be many fields that may have positive / negative mass terms or higher polynomials . even in that case",

    "obviously , the additional light field changes the spectrum .",
    "in the inflationary universe we may expect many light scalar fields @xmath19 . since the adiabatic field during inflation",
    "must be defined using all the fields that are moving during inflation , the mismatch between the end of hybrid inflation ( usually defined by @xmath0 that is coupled to the waterfall field ) and the uniform density hypersurfaces ( always defined by the adiabatic field ) causes creation of @xmath87 at the end of inflation . using the conventional @xmath87 formalism",
    ", we showed that the fields that are decoupled from the inflaton sector can play significant role in creating the curvature perturbation .",
    "the signs of the light fields may appear in the spectral index and/or in the non - gaussianity , which can be used to discriminate the origin of the perturbation .",
    "the precise calculation of these parameters is quite difficult when there are many fields during inflation , but our modest prediction is that the deviation from the standard prediction may indicate the presence of light scalar fields in the early universe .    in this paper hybrid inflation",
    "is simplified assuming that it ends with an instantaneous waterfall starting at the critical instability point @xmath5 .",
    "this simplification is not valid if inflation can continue for more than 60 e - folds during the waterfall  @xcite .",
    "however , the model that spends more than 60 e - folds during the waterfall should correspond to hilltop inflation ( with probably some modulation caused by the interaction with @xmath0  @xcite ) that should be discriminated from the conventional hybrid inflation scenario .",
