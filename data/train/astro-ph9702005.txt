    "the problem of formation of galaxies and large scale structure of the universe has an astrophysical aspect consisting in search of connection between properties of luminous objects and dark matter halo , as well as cosmological aspect consisting in determination of the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations . obtaining such spectrum from first principals",
    "would essentially simplify the solving of problem on the whole .",
    "unfortunately , today we can not surely say which the postinflation spectrum is : scale invariant @xmath9 with @xmath10 , tilted with @xmath11 , or more complicated . the nature of dark matter ( baryonic , collisionless cold dark matter , futher cdm , hot dark matter , futher hdm , or their mixture h+cdm , or other ) , and values of cosmological parameters @xmath12 ( @xmath13- hubble constant ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 - total mean density ) , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 - mean density of baryons ) and cosmological constant @xmath18 remain uncertain . more preferable from theoretical point of view spectra ( standard cdm model ,",

    "futhermore , the different spectra normalised to the cobe r.m.s .",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy predict close characteristics of the large scale structure of the universe , e.g. @xmath19 at degree angular scale , large scale peculiar velocity field etc .",
    "[ @xcite ] so that it is impossible to distinguish them .",
    "therefore , it is very important to build up the new cosmological tests based on extension of a class of objects with predicted observational manifestations sensitive to initial power spectrum on small scale .",
    "here we shall investigate the dependence of the number density of quasars ( qsos ) at different redshifts against initial power spectra . to make it possible",
    "we suppose that a qso is the early short term stage of evolution of a massive galaxy and appears in the corresponding peaks of initial random gaussian field of density fluctuations .",
    "the number density of already collapsed peaks of certain scale at different redshifts @xmath7 strongly depends on an amplitude and slope of the power spectrum of such field at small scales ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "such approach was applied independently by some authors .",

    "the number density of the peaks - precursors of massive galaxies ( @xmath26 ) , which passed a quasars stage soon after their central regions had collapsed , was calculated for the different spectra . the mean number density of qsos predicted by modified cdm model with @xmath27 and h+cdm",
    "was found to be less than observable one @xmath28 at @xmath25 .",
    "nusser & silk [ @xcite ] for finding @xmath0 in redshift range 2 - 5 for given spectrum used the gaussian peaks formalism by bardeen et al .",

    "they have concluded that tilted cdm model with @xmath32 , h+cdm ( @xmath33 ) and scaled cdm with @xmath34 are compatible with the mean abundance of quasars at @xmath35 .",
    "ma & bertchinger [ @xcite ] have carried out the numerical simulation of formation of elements of large scale structure of the universe with masses @xmath36 in hybrid h+cdm models and analysed the possibility of explanation of the observable number density of qsos at @xmath37 in the framework of the press - schechter formalism .",
    "they have shown that h+cdm model with @xmath38 predicts @xmath0 which matches the observable one if quasars are created soon after collapse of nearly spherical peaks .",
    "the goal of the paper is an improvement of this approach to the explanation of the observable data on abundance of the bright qsos in wider range @xmath39 [ @xcite ] , testing of the preferable initial spectra , which marginally match other observable data on large scale structure of the universe , search of spectrum momenta to reproduce the observable data on @xmath0 and construction the suitable phenomenological spectrum on small scale .",
    "we explore the distribution of quasar abundance over redshift @xmath0 in the framework of the theory of formation of the large scale structure of the universe in the peaks of random gaussian field of scalar density fluctuations as consequence of gravitational instability on the einstein - de sitter cosmological background . in this",

    "massive black hole in central region of such peak may be formed during @xmath74 years as it follows from the physical models of quasar mechanism ( see , for example , [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose that qso stage of galaxy evolution begins soon after collapse of central region of peak @xmath72 or later by certain time interval @xmath75 called a time delay .",
    "duration of the qso stage or quasar lifetime is @xmath76 .",
    "in such approach the number density of the qsos at redshift @xmath7 is the number density of corresponding peaks of density fluctuations ( precursors of massive galaxies ) which had collapsed between @xmath77 and @xmath72 .",

    "as we can see , the number density of qsos @xmath0 depends upon the duration of the quasar stage @xmath76 , the time delay @xmath75 , parameters of the threshold function @xmath43 and @xmath85 , momenta of spectrum smoothed by galactic filter @xmath41 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and fraction @xmath2 of peaks - precursors passing quasar stage and visible by earth observer .",
    "if quasar stage is long - term ( @xmath88 ) then the number density of qsos at all @xmath7 is equal to fraction of already collapsed peaks - precursors of massive galaxies visible from earth at quasar stage of their evolution : @xmath89 .",
    "if quasar stage is short - term ( @xmath90 ) , then it follows from ( 7 ) and ( 6 ) that @xmath91 it is valid for above mentioned estimation of @xmath92 years .    we suppose that the duration of the quasar stage @xmath76 , the time delay @xmath75 and parameters of threshold function @xmath43 and @xmath85 do not depend on the @xmath7 .",

    "rest four values @xmath2 , @xmath76 , @xmath43 and @xmath85 are unknown .",
    "finding of them by method of minimization of divergence vector is a matter of testing of known spectra .",
    "we try also to reconstruct the initial power spectrum from observable data on number density of qsos in wide range of redshifts and massive galaxies on @xmath98 . for this",

    "so , we solve the overdetermined system of equations ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) ( or ( 10 ) only ) by method of minimization of the divergence vector using mathcad [ @xcite ] software .",
    "we shall test the preferable initial power spectra of density fluctuations on the flat friedmanian background expected in standard cdm model ( @xmath114 , @xmath4 ) , tilted cdm ones and hybrid h+cdm one ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath4 ) , which marginally match other observational data on large scale structure of the universe [ @xcite - @xcite ] .",

    "is taken from the paper by holtzman [ @xcite ] .",
    "all spectra we normalised to produce the cobe data on cmb temperature anisotropy at angular scales @xmath120 [ @xcite ] : @xmath121 .",
    "we calculate @xmath122 using the approximation formula by wilson and silk [ @xcite ] for correlation function of cmb temperature anisotropy measured by receiver with gaussian response function and exact formula [ @xcite ] for correlation function @xmath123 .",
    "both sachs - wolfe and doppler effects are taken into account ( see also [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the contribution of tensor mode to @xmath19 is different in different models of inflation . in the most of them it is not dominating at the cobe angular scale (",
    "see review by [ @xcite ] and references cited therein ) , in the some ones it is negligible even if @xmath124 ( for example `` natural '' inflation , [ @xcite ] ) . in this work , like ones cited here , we consider only models of inflation which give no significant tensor mode .",
    "but one can easily cross over to models of inflation with significant tensor mode when ratio @xmath125 is known ( here @xmath126 and @xmath127 is contribution of tensor and scalar modes correspondingly ) .",
    "the constant of normalization then will be @xmath128 , the momenta of spectrum @xmath129 , peaks - precursors of qsos will be collapsed at @xmath130 , where values without ( @xmath131 ) are ones calculated without tensor mode .",

    "mass fluctuations in the top - hat sphere with radius @xmath134 , are presented in tabl.1 .",
    "( for comparison , our normalization constant a for cdm model agrees with analogous constant from paper [ @xcite ] reduced to h=0.5 and @xmath135 with accuracy better then 0.1% ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see , the main feature of all solutions is the relation between momenta : @xmath136 .",
    "what kind of spectrum have such relations between its momenta on the galaxy scale ?",
    "we attempted to modify the standard cdm spectrum on small scale by force of reducing and enhancing of its power in order to obtain momenta of spectra from table 4 .",
    "locations and amplitudes of such modifications were unknown parameters and were found from 3 equations for given momenta @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath41 using mathcad software package .",
    "it was successful for momenta from the column 1 in table 4 only , for which parameter @xmath137 .",
    "the phenomenological power spectrum of density fluctuations obtained in such way is @xmath138 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath119 is the same as in standard cdm .",
    "the spectrum has shelf - like reducing of power at @xmath142 in comparison with standard cdm normalised to the cobe @xmath120 angular scale temperature anisotropy of cmb ( @xmath143 spectrum in fig .",
    "7 ) .    the correlation function of galaxies for it does not contradict observable data .",
    "other cosmological consequences of such spectrum are being investigated yet .",
    "the parameter @xmath144 for momenta from columns 2 - 5 in table 4 is extremely small ( 0.04 - 0.0004 ) , so that phenomenological power spectrum for them , obviously , must be extraordinary too . indeed , spectrum with momenta from column 2 ( @xmath145 spectrum in fig .",
    "7 ) has two narrow bumps at @xmath146 and @xmath147 and shelf - like reducing of power at @xmath148 in comparison with standard cdm .",
    "since its correlation function of bright galaxies strongly contradicts observable one , the solutions from columns 2 - 5 in table 4 can be interpreted as meaningless from physical point of view .",
    "so , only spectra with momenta from column 1 ( @xmath149 , or close to them , are cosmologically significant .",
    "= 8truecm    = 8truecm    = 8truecm      masses of galaxies which pass through quasar stage ( host galaxies ) are @xmath150 , so that it is coordinated with the black hole accretion models of quasar phenomenon [ @xcite ] .",
    "an optical luminosity of the bright quasars is @xmath151 .",
    "their lifetime multiplied by @xmath2 in all cases is @xmath152 years , because we denote @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is @xmath155 in the units of @xmath156 .",
    "if the fraction of the black hole mass converted into optical radiation is @xmath157 , the ratio of the quasar s mass to that of the host galaxy is @xmath158 , then @xmath159 that gives @xmath160 where @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 .",
    "thus , in the models with phenomenological power spectrum and spectra tested here only less than @xmath164 of massive galaxies pass through quasar stage and are visible by earth observer .",
    "recently we [ @xcite ] carried out the similar calculations of evolution of quasar number density for the same spectra ( cdm with n=1 , 0.8 , 0.7 and h+cdm ) normalised to @xmath165 , where galactic biasing parameter @xmath166 was calculated in the framework of gaussian statistics of density peaks [ @xcite ] and was equal to 1.40 , 1.47 , 1.53 and 1.76 respectively . from comparison of results of this work with previous ones it follows that the dependence of quasar number density on @xmath7 is very sensitive to the normalisation of spectrum in all models . in our previous papers the modified on small scale standard cdm spectrum for reproducing of the observable data on number density of qsos at different redshifts has reducing of power on scale @xmath167 and bump on scale @xmath168 ( dotted line in fig.7 ) . its difference from spectrum shown in fig.7",
    "is caused by different power of initial cdm spectrum on @xmath169 as a result of different normalisation .",
    "it should be remarked here , though formally this method is sensitive to spectrum on small scale up to @xmath170 when it is smoothed by gaussian filter function with @xmath171 ( or top - hat @xmath172 ) nevertheless we are not sure that calculation of peak number density of galaxy scale is exact for cases of spectrum like standard cdm and , especially , cdm + short wave bump models .",
    "this is concerned mainly with the well known problem cloud - in - cloud unresolved by now in the frame of peak formalizm used here .",
    "now let us compare our results with those by nusser and silk [ @xcite ] .",
    "the curve @xmath0 for @xmath173 ( line 6 in fig.3 ) without threshold function , recalculated to @xmath174 years , coordinates with the corresponding curve in fig.2 of work by nusser & silk [ @xcite ] quite satisfactory at high z. the some divergence of these curves at low z are caused mainly by diferent ways of definition the mass of peaks .",
    "= 8truecm    in our work the value @xmath175 corresponding to collapse of spherical - symmetrical peaks , is adopted .",
    "therefore , in our approach the qsos are formed in spheroidal peaks only .",
    "the fraction of spheroidal peaks is @xmath176 [ @xcite ] , the fraction of massive galaxies with @xmath177 passed through quasar stage in all cases does not exceed @xmath164 .",
    "so , the assumption that qsos appear only in spherical peaks of density fluctuations is not contradictory in our approach . but its conformity to reality should be proved or objected by elaborated numerical simulations of the evolution of qsos which start from initial conditions determined at the linear stage of the evolution of peaks .",
    "substantiations of the value @xmath178 as well as dependence or independence of both quasar lifetime @xmath76 and time delay @xmath75 on redshift @xmath7 will be the subject of the future works .",
    "c we put constraints on the cosmological models based on their ability to reproduce the rise of quasar abundance up to redshifts @xmath179 and following fall up to @xmath180 assuming that quasar nature is the same at different redshifts and @xmath76 , @xmath75 and @xmath2 do not depend on z. moreover , if we have only 3 unknown values @xmath181 , @xmath43 and @xmath85 in equation system ( 10 - 11 ) then we can not reproduce the @xmath94 given by boyle et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] and schmidt et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] with sufficient accuracy in the models tested here .",
    "but when @xmath41 , @xmath86 and @xmath182 are supposed to be unknown values too , such reproducing is possible .",
    "apparently , for other models of quasars , which explain the rise and fall of the @xmath94 by astrophysics of quasars ( e.g. [ @xcite ] ) , the constraints on the cosmological models may be other .",
    "but it is the subject of separate work .",
    "here we only confirm that such dependence of quasar abundance on z can be explained in the framework of most simple astrophysical models of quasars , which look rather plausible and motivated in order to be put in the base of similar research .",
    "the phenomenological power spectrum obtained here ( @xmath183 ) has shelf - like reducing of power at @xmath142 .",
    "such spectra with broken scale invariance is generated in some inflationary scenarios ( e.g. [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "the typical scale and the height of the shelf - like reducing determined here can be connected with some constants , which characterise the underlying inflationary models .    if we treat the used observational data more critically and suppose that @xmath94 given by schmidt et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] and boyle et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] is only lower limit for number density of qsos at all @xmath7 then the next constraints follow from the presented results : on the small scale the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations is nearly cdm with @xmath22 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 years , @xmath186 years .",
    "thus , the main assumption that quasar phenomenon is active short term stage of evolution of some small fraction of massive galaxies with @xmath187 and appears in peaks of random gaussian density fluctuation field allows to explain the general feature of @xmath94 given by boyle et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] and schmidt et al .",
    "[ @xcite ] : fast increasing of number density from @xmath98 to @xmath188 up to value @xmath189 and following monotonous decreasing on @xmath190 . apparently ,",
    "a constant quasar abundance from @xmath191 to @xmath192 [ @xcite ] can not be explained under these assumptions .    if the nature of bright qsos is the same at different redshifts ( @xmath76 , @xmath75 , @xmath2 are constants ) then any model spectrum tested here such as standard cdm spectrum ( @xmath114 , @xmath4 ) , tilted one with @xmath193 and hybrid h+cdm ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 ) explains the number density of such qsos in redshift range @xmath194 , but in range @xmath195 only tilted cdm with @xmath5 ( @xmath196 years , @xmath197 , @xmath97 ) does explain , and in range @xmath198 - none of them .",
    "consequently more crucial for testing of spectra is number density of qsos on high @xmath7 .",
    "exact reproducing of number density of qsos at @xmath199 under above mentioned assumptions can be done in the flat cosmological model with the density fluctuation power spectrum which gives @xmath200 and @xmath201 at galaxy scale ( @xmath202 ) .",

    "if physically motivated quasar lifetime is @xmath204 years , then @xmath205 that matches the estimations of @xmath2 done above .",
    "thus , redshift distribution of quasar abundance is very sensitive to the amplitude and slope of the initial power spectrum of density perturbations on galaxy scale .",
    "but it can be effective test when complete number density of qsos with mass larger than fixed value will be known with confidence for all redshifts and physical parameters connected with nature of quasar phenomenon ( the quasar lifetime @xmath76 , time delay @xmath75 , fraction of galaxies which pass through quasar stage @xmath2 , linear amplitude of peaks @xmath206 collapsing just now and threshold function ) will be substantiated .",
    "the last needs the detailed investigation of connection of quasar phenomenon with initial configuration of density fluctuation by the help of numerical simulations of its evolution .",
