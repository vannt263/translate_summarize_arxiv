    "the hopf fibrations @xcite @xmath3 provide fibrations of spheres whose fibers are _ great spheres_. algebraic topology imposes severe restrictions on possible dimensions of the spheres and the fibers , the above list actually contains all the existing cases .",
    "the study of such fibrations is motivated , in particular , by the classical blaschke conjecture of differential geometry , see @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for classification of fibrations of spheres by great spheres up to diffeomorphism .    given a fibration of @xmath4 by great spheres @xmath5 ,",
    "the radial projection from the center on an affine hyperplane yields a fibration of @xmath6 by _ pairwise skew _ @xmath2-planes .",
    "two affine subspaces of an affine space are called skew if they neither intersect nor contain parallel directions .",
    "for example , the projection of the hopf fibration @xmath7 gives a fibration of @xmath8 by pairwise skew straight lines ( that lie on a nested family of hyperboloids of one sheet ) , see figure [ firstf ] .        in this paper , we study fibrations @xmath9 whose fibers are pairwise skew affine subspaces .",
    "we refer to such fibrations as @xmath0-_fibrations_. the topological restrictions are less prohibitive in this situation , and the list is considerably longer that that of hopf .",
    "our goal here is to describe all pairs @xmath0 for which @xmath0-fibrations exist .",
    "the problem of classification is not addressed here .",
    "let us consider an a - priori less restrictive problem : given @xmath2 and @xmath1 , does there exist a fibration of a small disc , @xmath10 , with pairwise skew flat @xmath2-dimensional fibers , i.e. , by intersections of @xmath10 with pairwise skew affine subspaces ?",
    "we call such fibrations _ local_. a local fibration may fail to extend to the whole @xmath6 . yet",
    ", both problems have the same answer .    [ thethm ]",
    "@xmath6 admits a continuous fibration with @xmath2-dimensional pairwise skew affine fibers if and only if @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the classical hurwitz - radon function . the local problem has the same answer .",
    "we define the hurwitz - radon function in the next section .",
    "we discuss various particular cases and consequences of this theorem in section [ exsec ] .",
    "let us mention now just one .",
    "we have an obvious reduction from a local @xmath0-fibration to a local @xmath13-fibration ( intersection with a hyperplane transverse to the fibers ) .",
    "this leads to the notion of _ dominant _ @xmath0-fibration such that @xmath14-fibration does not exist .",
    "hopf s @xmath15 and @xmath16-fibrations are dominant .",
    "the remarkable fibration @xmath17 is the first dominant non - hopf fibration .",
    "let us briefly mention a related subject , totally skew embeddings of manifolds into euclidean space .",
    "a submanifold is called totally skew if the tangent spaces at any pair of distinct points are skew , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the hurwitz - radon function @xmath18 is defined as follows . write @xmath19 , then @xmath20 this formula was discovered in about 1920 independently by a. hurwitz and j. radon in the following context .",
    "a square identity of size @xmath21 $ ] is an identity @xmath22 where @xmath23 are bilinear expressions in @xmath24 and @xmath25 with real coefficients .",
    "the hurwitz - radon theorem states that @xmath26 is the largest integer for which there exists a @xmath27$]-identity @xcite , @xcite .    the cases @xmath28 and @xmath29 are special : these are the only case where @xmath30 . for example",

    "these four special cases correspond to the classification of normed division algebras , @xmath33 , also due to hurwitz @xcite .",
    "we refer here to @xcite for general information about square identities and related topics .",
    "the subject still remains an active area of research ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hurwitz in his last paper @xcite ( and independently radon @xcite ) considers square identities of type @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "he rewrites these identities in the form of @xmath34-dimensional families of @xmath35-matrices .",
    "consider an identity @xmath36 since @xmath23 are bilinear in @xmath37 , one has @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41-vectors and @xmath42 are real @xmath35-matrices .",
    "the square identity is equivalent to the equations : @xmath43 thus , every @xmath34-dimensional space of real @xmath35-matrices with this property defines a square identity of type @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "it follows that every non - trivial linear combination of the matrices @xmath44 is non - degenerate . indeed , if @xmath45 then @xmath46 .",
    "square identities have several geometric applications .",
    "perhaps the best known one is the application to vector fields on spheres . the famous theorem of f.  adams @xcite states that , _ on a sphere @xmath47 , the maximal number of vector fields linearly independent at each point is @xmath48_.    the existence part follows from the hurwitz construction . given a square identity of type @xmath27 $ ] ,",
    "i.e. , a set of matrices @xmath44 satisfying ( [ hur ] ) , following hurwitz , consider @xmath49 matrices @xmath50 that are skew - symmetric . applying these linear maps to the points of a round sphere @xmath51 , one obtains @xmath49 ( linear ) tangent vectors fields .",
    "the condition ( [ hur ] ) guarantees that these vector fields are indeed linearly independent at each point .",
    "the converse statement is the difficult part of the adams theorem whose proof is based on algebraic topology .",
    "f. adams , p. lax and r. phillips @xcite considered @xmath34-dimensional spaces of real @xmath35-matrices with the property that every non - zero element of the space is a non - degenerate matrix ; they called it `` property p '' .",

    "it follows from the adams theorem that the restriction to the dimension  @xmath34 is actually the same : @xmath52 .    we extend the notion of property p to rectangular matrices in a straightforward way",

    "this is not a coincidence .    in one direction",

    ", the first row of the table contains the full information .",
    "the dominant cases determine all the entries in the table .",
    "each dominant @xmath0-fibration generates a sequences @xmath75 reaching the previous dominant case where @xmath2 jumps up again .",
    "let us start with a simple observation : a fibration @xmath0 is dominant if and only if there exists @xmath41 such that @xmath76 indeed , in this case @xmath14 does not satisfy ( [ theeq ] ) so that the @xmath0-fibration is dominant .",
    "conversely , if @xmath77 , then we can increase @xmath2 and @xmath1 by 1 , and the @xmath0-fibration is not dominant .",

    "let us emphasize that the statements rely on the full force of adams s theorem and can not be obtained using less advanced topological methods ( such as stiefel - whitney classes ) .",
    "suppose a local @xmath0-fibration is given .",
    "choose one fiber and identify it with @xmath96 .",
    "consider the subspace @xmath97 orthogonal to @xmath98 .",
    "every fiber close to the `` horizontal '' @xmath98 is the graph of an affine map : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the coordinate in the transversal @xmath97 and where @xmath101 is a linear map continuously depending on @xmath100 ( defined for @xmath100 sufficiently close to the origin ) .",
    "define the linear map @xmath102 whose matrix is obtained from the matrix of  @xmath103 by joining the column @xmath100 .",
    "the next lemma gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the fibration to be skew .",

    "if these projected vectors are linearly dependent , then so are the columns of @xmath114 .",
    "this contradicts lemma [ lemcond ] for points @xmath100 and  @xmath115 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath116 .",
    "the hurwitz - radon theorem implies the existence of matrices @xmath117 that span a space of @xmath35-matrices with property p. in other words , we have a bilinear map @xmath118 such that @xmath119 , if @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "equivalently , we have a @xmath41-dimensional space of @xmath122-matrices @xmath123 with property p.    consider the linear map of this @xmath41-dimensional space of @xmath122-matrices to @xmath97 sending a matrix to its last column .",
    "this linear map is a linear injection , otherwise property p is violated .",
    "hence it is a linear isomorphism and the last column can be chosen as the coordinate @xmath100 .",
    "we thus obtain a linear family @xmath102 .",
    "the condition of lemma [ lemcond ] is satisfied because @xmath124 by linearity .    it remains to show that the defined fibration is global",
