    ", there is a residual symmetry which acts by flipping the sign of any two of the three complex functions @xmath223 .",

    "the results for @xmath239 are summarised in the following table :       where @xmath241 , and again the sign ambiguity in the @xmath242 column is due to the fact that @xmath235 at the extrema .",
    "the origin is a degenerate critical point .",
    "the field @xmath242 is massless and hence corresponds to a flat direction in the space of solutions , which explains why the critical point at the origin is degenerate .",
    "in addition , there are four isolated saddle points .",
    "a few remarks are in order concerning the critical points found above .",
    "first of all , we note that the critical point at the origin ( i.e. where all scalar fields vanish ) corresponds to the abelian canonical connection on a rank-3 complex vector bundle over @xmath30 and is thus arguably the simplest explicit example of a @xmath0-instanton on an aloff - wallach space . also , the point where @xmath243 and all other scalar fields are equal to unity corresponds to a flat connection @xmath244 .",
    "these observations are valid for both choices of @xmath239 or @xmath240 .",
    "now that we have found the critical points of the superpotential , we consider the gradient flow connecting suitable pairs of them .",
    "in other words , we look for solutions of  ( [ 3.20 ] ) , which start at @xmath245 from a critical point with a larger value of @xmath27 and flow as @xmath246 towards a critical point with a smaller value of @xmath27 .",
    "these kink configurations are finite - action solutions of  ( [ 3.5 ] ) and thus allow a physical interpretation as spin(7)-instantons on @xmath247 .    in the search for instanton solutions , one",
    "is immediately faced with two technical difficulties .",
    "first , the structure of the equations which need to be solved is such that conventional analytic methods ( and known exact solution anstze ) are not applicable .",
    "for example , the well - known hyperbolic tangent type kink solutions , which _ inter alia _ work in one dimension lower  @xcite , do not respect the structure of  ( [ 3.20 ] ) .",
    "this means we need to resort to numerical methods .",
    "second , with the exception of the degenerate critical point at the origin , all other critical points are isolated saddle points .",
    "solutions flowing towards these points are unstable . for a given starting point",
    ", there is exactly one trajectory whose end point is an isolated saddle point and it is crucial to pick the initial direction to be exactly along this unique trajectory .",
    "combined with the first point , this presents us with a numerical `` fine - tuning problem '' when it comes to choosing the correct initial conditions for the desired flow .",
    "one would somehow need to know the trajectory s direction at the starting point before even attempting to ( numerically ) solve the equations , leaving oneself with a `` fishing in the dark '' situation .",
    "moreover , even the smallest deviation from the correct direction will lead to solutions which , instead of approaching the saddle point , will roll off to @xmath248 swiftly .",
    "there is only one case where this `` fine - tuning problem '' does not occur and where we have been able to find an explicit ( numerical ) solution .",
    "it is the kink solution for @xmath249 flowing from @xmath250 at @xmath245 to @xmath251 as @xmath246 .",
    "the numerical solution for this case is shown in figure  [ flow_eqs_minussqrt2_ex1 ] .",
    "it should be noted that the shape of these curves resembles that of a hyperbolic tangent type kink .",
    "indeed , although a hyperbolic tangent ansatz does not solve equations  ( [ 3.20 ] ) , it does provide a good approximation .",
    "the maximal deviation from the actual numerical solution is of the order of @xmath252 .",
