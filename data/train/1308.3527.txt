    "in a classical chaotic system , exponential sensitivity to its initial conditions does not directly yield exponential growth in physical observables due to the complicated stretching and folding dynamics in phase space .",
    "so it sounds more unlikely to have an exponential growth in the expectation value of quantum observables for a long time scale . indeed , after a very short time scale of dynamical evolution , even the notion of exponential sensitivity itself becomes problematic in most quantum systems .",
    "thus , apart from prototypical situations like inverted harmonic oscillators @xcite , long - lasting exponential quantum spreading ( eqs ) sounds elusive @xcite .",
    "recently , in a variant @xcite of the kicked - rotor model @xcite that has been studied extensively for decades , we reported long - lasting eqs in momentum space .",
    "the found eqs is in striking contrast to other known dynamical behaviors in kicked - rotor models , such as ballistic diffusion , superdiffusion , as well as linear diffusion followed by dynamical localization @xcite . in particular , a double - kicked rotor model with two tunable time parameters",
    "is considered , with the first time parameter tuned precisely on the so - called main resonance .",
    "this defines the so - called on - resonance double kicked rotor model ( ordkr ) .",
    "the other time parameter is tuned close to the so - called anti - resonance condition @xcite or to high - order resonance conditions . with",
    "the second parameter tuned close to an anti - resonance condition , the eqs mechanism is as follows .",
    "first , a quantum ordkr , though in its deep quantum regime , can still behave remarkably close to the dynamics of a pseudo - classical limit @xcite , which can be derived using the anti - resonance condition .",
    "second , the pseudo - classical limit has one unstable fixed point , and the stable branch of the separatrix associated with the unstable fixed point can almost fully accommodate a zero - momentum initial state .",
    "third , as time evolves , the quantum ensemble is attracted to the unstable fixed point and then exponentially repelled from the fixed point along its unstable manifold . as also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the detuning from the anti - resonance condition , the time scale of this exponential behavior can be made arbitrarily long .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite was not able to explain eqs under general situations , i.e. , those with the second time parameter tuned to a rather arbitrary high - order resonance condition .",
    "it is thus still unclear what are the general and necessary conditions for eqs to occur in ordkr .    to better understand long - lasting eqs , we carry out a detailed study and adopt a more general framework to illuminate eqs in ordkr",
    "specifically , in treating the kicked - rotor dynamics under a high - order resonance condition , we adapt to ordkr a technique of analyzing the quasi - resonant kr dynamics @xcite , based on a spinor formulation supplemented by the born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite .",
    "it is found that the existence of a flat - band ( or an effectively flat - band ) of ordkr at zero detuning is one important feature behind the exponential dynamics . a flat band or",
    "an almost flat band makes it possible for a very simple pseudoclassical limit to emerge .",
    "this fact turns out to be very important to explain and understand eqs qualitatively .",
    "however , on a quantitative level , we also observe that predictions based on a pseudoclassical limit may not work well in accurately predicting the eqs rate .",
    "this finding is shown to have a link with the fine spectral properties of the floquet bands of ordkr .",
    "the paper is organized as the follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first introduce necessary terms for describing a quantum kicked - rotor under resonance . in the same section",
    "we also introduce ordkr together with its important spectral features that can be connected with eqs . in sec .",
    "iii , we study in detail the dynamics of ordkr when its second time parameter is tuned close to a general high - order resonance .",
    "we discuss the dynamics induced by a small detuning from high - order resonances and then show how simple pseudoclassical limits can emerge .",
    "we then discuss in depth why eqs occurs and what should be the associated conditions .",
    "we also compare and comment on the eqs rate obtained from the pseudoclassical limits with those directly obtained from the quantum dynamics .",
    "section iv concludes this paper .",
    "in dimensionless units , the quantum map operator ( floquet operator ) for a periodically kicked rotor model can be written as @xmath1 \\exp\\left[-ik\\cos(\\theta)\\right ] \\ ; , \\label{flokr}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is an angular coordinate , @xmath3 is an effective planck constant , @xmath4 describes the profile of a kicking potential , @xmath5 is determined by the strength of the kicking potential , and @xmath6 can be regarded as the ( angular ) momentum operator , whose eigenstates @xmath7 with eigenvalues @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) will be used as the basis states of the hilbert space ; in the @xmath10-representation , @xmath11 . for later convenience , one may write @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively denote the two unitary operators on the rhs in eq .",

    "this is called a kr quantum resonance and is due to translational invariance in momentum space @xcite .",
    "denoting @xmath18 the shift operator in momentum space : @xmath19 , one finds that , whenever @xmath20 with @xmath21 mutually prime , @xmath22 so @xmath16 commutes with momentum space translations by multiples of @xmath23 whenever @xmath24 is even , and with momentum space translations by multiples of @xmath25 whenever @xmath24 is odd . in both cases , the bloch theorem is applicable in momentum space .",
