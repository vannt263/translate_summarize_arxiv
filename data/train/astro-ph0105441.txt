    ".    knowledge of the fraction of binary stars in a globular cluster is critical for the understanding of its evolution .",
    "mass segregation , caused by two - body relaxation in a cluster , tends to transfer kinetic energy outwards from the core and move the cluster towards higher central condensation .",
    "this  gravothermal collapse \" can be profoundly modified by the existence of even a small binary star population @xcite . through encounters with single stars ,",
    "the gravitational binding energy of binaries can be extracted and converted into kinetic energy , halting the runaway collapse of the core .",
    "the efficiency of this process depends on the frequency of binary stars , effectively the  heat source \" for the cluster .",
    "previous searches for photometric binaries in 47 tucanae have been made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other globular clusters previously surveyed for binary stars include m71 @xcite , m5 @xcite , @xmath5 cen @xcite , m4 @xcite , ngc 4372 @xcite and ngc 6397 @xcite .",
    "a summary of contact binaries found in globular clusters has recently been published by @xcite .",
    "all of these surveys suffer from some degree of limitation .",
    "rarely have they been deep enough to extend to main sequence stars , except those right at cluster turnoff .",
    "the ground - based work has been restricted by crowding constraints to either sparse clusters or regions outside the cores of dense clusters like 47 tuc and studies using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have been limited by observing - time constraints to relatively short temporal coverage .",
    "estimates of the binary frequency in globular clusters include the work of @xcite and @xcite who derived overall binary frequencies of 22% and 28% ( with large uncertainties ) for m71 and m5 respectively .",
    "these estimates are based on the discovery of a handful of contact or near - contact binaries , and the assumption of a flat frequency distribution of binaries with @xmath6 .",
    "it is also assumed that initially detached binaries with short periods are brought into contact through the braking effect of a magnetic stellar wind . in the dense core of a globular cluster such as 47 tuc , these assumptions are subject to modification by the effects of stellar dynamics",
    ". binary stars , being more massive on average than single stars , will preferentially sink towards the center of the cluster s gravitational potential well .",
    "in addition , interactions between and among binary and single stars can result in the formation and destruction of binaries @xcite .",
    "others have taken the route of using single - epoch photometry to derive binary frequencies from color - magnitude - diagram morphology .",
    "this requires very precise photometry and is also reliant on assumptions regarding the binary mass - ratio distribution .",
    "estimates of the binary star frequency by this method include those of @xcite , who found likely values in the range 1538% for ngc 6752 , and @xcite who derived 35% for the core and 20% for the outer parts of the young lmc cluster ngc 1818 .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a new search for binary stars in the core of 47 tucanae using hst .",
    "this is by far the deepest survey of this type ever made , extending from the main sequence turnoff of the cluster at @xmath7 , down to magnitudes as faint as @xmath8 . ",
    "[ sectobservations ] through [ sectother ] will discuss the observations and results for various classes of binary stars detected within this primary sample of over 46000 stars that never saturate the detectors .",

    "near - continuous observations for 8.3 days have created the best - sampled time - series data of any globular cluster observed with hst , or even from the ground for a comparable temporal window .",
    "the data were taken over an 8.3-day period , 1999 july 3 - 11 , during which hst was pointed continuously at 47 tuc .",
    "the primary goal of the campaign was a search for close - in , jupiter - size planets by detection of transits .",
    "the results of this search are described in @xcite .",
    "only one field was observed , with the pc1 ccd including cluster center . during the observations ,",
    "a series of 160s exposures were made with wfpc2 , alternating between the f555w and f814w filters .",
    "gaps in the data occurred during earth occultations and south - atlantic - anomaly passages .",
    "a deliberate program of uniform subpixel dithering was introduced between exposures in order that a spatially - oversampled mean image could be created from the combined images , and to provide a stationary distribution of offsets in support of robust time series .",
    "a total of 636 f555w ( @xmath9 ) and 653 f814w ( @xmath10 ) exposures were obtained in these primary time series .",
    "an additional set of 26 f336w exposures were obtained in orbits with extended visibility periods ( as the target neared the continuous viewing zone for hst ) to provide @xmath11-band colors and modest time series information .",
    "a few much shorter @xmath9 and @xmath10 exposures were also taken to allow photometry on stars above the turnoff .",
    "the data frames were initially put through the standard hst calibration pipeline which involves bias and dark subtraction and flat - field correction . for the purposes of creating good star lists and absolute photometry , image combinations were performed using methods fully described in gilliland _",
    "( 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "briefly , a polynomial representation was developed for the mean intensity as a function of dither offsets within each pixel by combining the individual undersampled dithered images and making use of consistently developed registrations .",
    "an oversampled combined image was created and the positions and magnitudes of the individual stars found using daophot ii @xcite .",
    "stars for which @xmath12 90 % of the light within nominal apertures of radius 5 ( pc1 ) , 4 ( wf chips ) pixels comes from neighbors , or for which the aperture would include any pixels from bleeding trails on neighbouring saturated stars , are excluded .",
    "the master star list was generated based on the f555w and f814w data only .",
    "the absolute photometry used here incorporates all standard corrections for cte with wfpc2 @xcite and filter color terms from @xcite .",
    "zero points were determined by matching the magnitudes of identifiable portions of the cluster main sequence to those measured for 47 tuc by other investigators .",
    "@xmath9 has been set by forcing @xmath9 = 17.14 for a first moment centroid over @xmath13 .",
    "this value was selected as a representative average of @xcite ( @xmath9 = 17.12 ) , unpublished results from rlg ( 17.14 ) , @xcite ( 17.20 ) , and @xcite ( 17.22 ) . for @xmath10 , an adjustment to @xmath14 = 0.69 is forced over 17.48 @xmath15 @xmath9 @xmath15 17.73 , based on values for the position of bluest extent of the main sequence from @xcite ( @xmath14 = 0.68 ) and @xcite ( 0.71 ) .",
    "systematic errors of 0.05 magnitudes for the zero point uncertainty of the absolute photometry scales should be carried .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram from all four ccds combined is shown in fig .",
    "[ cmcombined ] .    to generate time series for each star , the oversampled representation was subtracted from each individual image by evaluating it at the appropriate dither position and convolving with a compensation kernel , calculated for each frame to represent focus variations due to thermal changes in the telescope .",
    "difference - photometry time series were developed for each star by fitting a psf ( evaluated from isolated stars in each direct image ) at the known star position in the difference images .",
    "the resulting counts in the time series were then normalised by the total expected in direct images based on star - by - star magnitudes .",
    "these time series were cleaned by removal of residual , small linear correlations with changes in the ensemble - average relative intensity and with terms up to cubic in the combination of @xmath16 and @xmath17 dither locations .",
    "the difference - image photometry approach ( e.g. , see @xcite , and @xcite ) , as extended here to under - sampled data , provides near - optimal results even for stars that are strongly blended with neighbors .",
    "as shown in @xcite , time series precisions range from 0.003 near cluster turnoff at @xmath18 17 , to 0.01 at @xmath18 19.5 , 0.03 at @xmath18 21 , and 0.1 at @xmath18 23 , extending the earlier results beyond the limit for which giant planets might be detected .",
    "the difference - image photometry solutions are intimately linked with the process that develops the over - sampled combined images . in particular",
    ", the underlying assumption is that the intensity registered for any pixel can be represented as a function of a constant source and changes only as a result of @xmath19 , @xmath20 offsets and focus changes image - to - image .",
    "thus for the vast majority of non - variable stars precisions near the fundamental limit imposed by poisson statistics of the source , background and readout noise are maintained .    for large - amplitude variables ,",
    "excess noise can arise since the solution may not properly decouple intensity changes in a given pixel that arise from @xmath19 , @xmath20 offsets of under - sampled psfs rather than intrinsic variations .",
    "this makes the time series of some variables noisier than for non - variable stars at similar magnitudes .",
    "we have investigated the characteristics of this excess `` model '' noise in some detail .",
    "for all the variable stars we detect , we calculate the magnitude of the model noise by subtracting in quadrature the mean rms for non - variables of the same @xmath9-magnitude from the rms scatter of the variable star measured from bins of 0.05 in phase .",
    "( by measuring in such small phase bins we eliminate most of the intrinsic variability . ) in fig .  [ extranoise ]",
    "we plot this excess noise as a function of amplitude for the variables stars we detected on the pc1 ccd with @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear that the model noise of the detected variables scales with amplitude of variability .",
    "the upper limit in the non - variable population is 5 mmag .",
    "( the few stars that lie above this boundary are affected by cosmetics such as diffraction spikes from nearby saturated stars and show photometric variations at the hst orbital frequency . )",
    "such plots for other ccds and magnitude ranges show similar behaviour , although the derived upper limit is obviously higher for fainter magnitudes .",
    "to illustrate the relative unimportance of this excess model noise for variable star detection , we consider the following scenarios . at amplitude 0.1 mag , the model noise is @xmath22 0.015 mag .",
    "given our time coverage with about 600 points in each of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bandpasses , we ask what is the signal - to - noise of a coherent signal with amplitude 0.1 mag and noise 0.015 mag . from @xcite , the signal - to - noise of the peak periodogram power is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of observations , @xmath25 is the signal amplitude and @xmath26 is the noise .",
    "if the model noise dominates the intrinsic rms noise , the s / n in each bandpass is greater than 6000 .",
    "if we consider the regime where @xmath27 mag with model noise 0.004 mag , a bright star will have a similar level of intrinsic noise so that the total noise ( adding in quadrature ) is @xmath22 0.006 mag .",
    "the s / n is then @xmath22 1000 per bandpass . if the amplitude is only 0.002 mag , even retaining the same noise level still gives a s / n of @xmath22 17 per bandpass . for fainter stars ,",
    "the intrinsic noise is always dominant at low signal levels . in summary , for small intrinsic amplitudes ,",
    "excess model noise is negligible in comparison to the intrinsic noise ; by the point at which large amplitudes may lead to significant excess noise , the variation is sufficiently large to be quite obvious .    in many cases the initial variability search returned multiple variables with similar periods in close spatial proximity .",
    "where stars are close enough that their point spread functions overlap to a significant degree ( which is common in such a crowded field ) the extracted time series for each will reflect the variability . in order to determine which of several blended stars is the true variable",
    ", we used the measured time variation to choose difference images near both the maximum and minimum for each variable .",
    "we then subtracted the average of the near - minimum images from the average of the near - maximum images .",
    "this phased , difference - image sum was then compared to a sum of the direct images for the same exposures .",
    "the true variable appeared in the difference - based sum as an isolated psf ; comparison with the direct image then provided a secure identification of the intrinsic variable .",
    "instances were found in this way of apparently - bright , low - amplitude variables having arisen from blending with nearby fainter variables with intrinsically large amplitudes .",
    "also , cases were turned up in which an apparent faint variable resulted from contamination via the wings of a moderately - distant , saturated , intrinsically - variable star .",
    "as noted at the beginning of this section , our observations were all taken at a single pointing , with the center of the globular cluster on the pc1 ccd .",
    "out to a radial distance of @xmath22 10 arcseconds , our area coverage is complete . beyond this , the non - uniform shape of the array of wfpc2 ccd s meant that our spatial sampling was lower . in several parts of the remainder of this paper ,",
    "we calculate binary - frequency statistics from our observations . since we expect binary stars to have a different degree of central concentration than single stars ( this",
    "is born out in   [ sectbydra ] ) , we need to be aware of bias which may be introduced by the non - uniform radial sampling of our survey . to this end",
    "we have calculated the radial area completeness function ( fig  [ radialarea ] ) which we use later to correct our statistics .",
    "for consistency with @xcite , we take cluster center to be at j2000 coordinates ( 00:24:05.87 , -72:04:51.2 ) from @xcite .",
    "such a correction implicitly assumes azimuthal symmetry for the cluster .",
    "normally our correction will be to a circular region within 90 arcseconds of the cluster center .",
    "the time - series data were searched for variability by several different methods . for near - sinusoidal signals ,",
    "the lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram is the most useful search technique .",
    "for some other types of variability , such as the lightcurves of detached eclipsing binaries , the ls periodogram is rather insensitive . in order not to miss any non - sinusoidal variability we searched for lightcurves where the mean of the lowest five consecutive points deviated from the lightcurve mean by a factor of 2 or more times that of the highest five points ( this test is sensitive to eclipsing binaries ) and vice versa ( sensitive to microlensing or flaring phenomena ) . in practice",
    ", all the variable stars found by this method were also found with the ls method .",
    "all of the variables found in the primary search ( of a smaller subset of 34091 stars ) for planet transits using matched - filter - convolution approaches that are optimally sensitive to detecting repeated eclipses ( @xcite , brown _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) , in preparation ) were recovered with these independent searches .",
    "the 160-@xmath0 time - series exposures were obtained at 240-@xmath0 intervals , providing a formal nyquist sampling frequency of 180  @xmath28 .",
    "the ls periodogram was thus calculated over the period range @xmath29 @xmath30 , frequencies @xmath31 @xmath32 .    in order to investigate the appropriate cutoff point for ls false alarm probabilities in our time series",
    ", we have calculated 10 000 gaussian - noise time series at the same sampling as our data .",
    "these were passed through the same ls analysis and the highest periodogram peak and its false alarm probability evaluated for each .",
    "the lowest false alarm probability recorded in each of the @xmath33- and @xmath34- band simulation sets was @xmath35 .",
    "guided by this we set the false alarm probability threshold at @xmath36 for the analysis of our data .",
    "the lightcurves for all stars in our sample having a ls false alarm probability less than this were examined in more detail .",
    "we excluded from this procedure periods within @xmath37 of a multiple of @xmath38 or @xmath39 times the hst orbital period ( 96.66 minutes ) . in order to pass our test for variability",
    ", we required that a peak greater than the false - alarm probability threshold be present in either the @xmath33- or @xmath34-band power spectra and that a peak at the same frequency be recognisable by visual inspection of the power spectrum of the other band .    in order to test our ability to find regular variability ,",
    "we have performed tests with simulated data .",
    "sinusoidal signals of random frequency and phase were injected into the lightcurve data for random stars ( excluding the small fraction of stars which had been found to be variable ) from the pc1 and wf2 ccds . because we sample randomly from the population of non - variable stars , the actual distribution of noise is automatically taken into account .",
    "the chosen periods were drawn with equal probability in @xmath40 over the range @xmath41 days .",
    "the same amplitude was used for @xmath34 and @xmath33 , with discrete values @xmath42 and with @xmath43 simulations for each amplitude .",
    "the resulting simulated lightcurves were passed through the same search procedure as the real data . from this",
    "we have characterized our variability recovery rate as a function of signal - period , signal - amplitude and mean @xmath34-magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ recoveryrate ] ) .",
    "the recovery rate is relatively independent of period except at the long period end where there is a drop - off in sensitivity .    in fig.[trueperiodrate ]",
    "we plot the fraction of the recovered variables for which the period was determined correctly to within 10% of the input period .",
    "there is a rapid decrease at the long - period end , especially for low - amplitude signals .",
    "for example , this implies that at magnitude @xmath44 only half of the variables we have detected with half - amplitudes @xmath45 mmag will have periods accurate to within @xmath46 .",
    "this is not as problematical as it may seem since ( see fig .",
    "[ recoveryrate ] ) our recovery rate is already low in this regime .",
    "a total of 114 variable stars were detected out of the 46422 non - saturated stars found on the four ccds .",
    "nearly all the variable stars detected are believed to be binaries . at periods from 0.2 days extending up to 1.1 days",
    "we find a number of contact binaries with obvious w uma lightcurves .",
    "interspersed in period with these , and with periods extending up to the @xmath22  10 day limit to our sensitivity , are many regular variables with near - sinusoidal to decidedly non - sinusoidal lightcurves .",
    "we interpret these stars as being by draconis variables - rotating , chromospherically - active main - sequence stars .",
    "since the timescale for spin - down of a young main - sequence star is vastly shorter than the age of 47 tucanae , these stars must also be in ( presumably tidally affected ) binary systems .",
    "in addition ( but not distinct from the previous category ) we find a number of eclipsing systems .",
    "finally , there are a few stars which do not fit into these categories .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a convention where we number variable stars separately for each of the four wfpc2 ccds .",
    "since the pc1 field overlaps with our previous observations @xcite , we keep the same numbering for the variable stars found in those studies . thus ( pc1-v01, ...",
    ",pc1-v16 ) in this paper are the same stars as ( v1, ... ,v16 ) in @xcite and @xcite . for the other ccds we begin numbering from unity ( e.g.",
    "the variables found in the wf2 field are named wf2-v01 , wf2-v02 , ... ) .",
    "ten of the stars in our sample ( figs  [ lceb2],[lceb ] , table  [ tableeb ] ) , by visual examination , are obvious detached eclipsing binaries with characteristic primary and secondary dips in their lightcurves .",
    "an additional eclipsing binary was found which showed only one eclipse during our observation period and this is grouped with the miscellaneous variables in  [ sectother ] .",
    "the periods of eclipsing binaries we observe today may not be their primordial periods . over time , tidal effects tend to circularize and then bring together initially - detached binaries . the upper cutoff period for tidal circularization increases with age and is likely to be in the range 1318 days for a population with age of 47 tucanae @xcite . with subsequent angular momentum loss , many binaries with periods less than some cutoff period will have evolved to significantly shorter periods during the lifetime of the cluster",
    "we have used the model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , through which the decrease of spin angular momentum by magnetic braking is coupled to an increase of orbital angular momentum ( and hence a shorter period ) to calculate this cutoff period . applied to a 0.9 @xmath47 star , we calculate that 4 days is the cutoff period for binaries in 47 tuc with mass ratio @xmath48 .",
    "those with smaller q would have evolved to contact in less than 11 gy .",
    "( note that this model does not apply to very low values of @xmath49 , such as for planets , where there is no significant tidal affect on the more massive component . ) for binaries where @xmath50 , none would have evolved to contact over the cluster lifetime , assuming they had primordial periods greater than 2.5 days .",
    "we thus consider here the five eclipsing binaries with periods @xmath51 4 days as being an `` unevolved sample '' and ask what their numbers imply about the fraction of primordial binary stars in the core of 47 tuc .",
    "we assume that we have detected all the binary stars in our sample which show two eclipses during the time span of the observations .",
    "this places an upper limit of @xmath22  16.6 days to the periods we could have detected , assuming that both primary and secondary eclipses are visible . using kepler s third law and geometry , the probability of detecting eclipses in a given binary with magnitude @xmath9 and period @xmath52 in days is @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the mass and radius in solar units of each component ( inferred from @xmath9 ) , @xmath56 is the minimum fraction of the eclipsed star s radius we require to be obscured for a detectable eclipse and @xmath57 is the observation period , 8.29 days . for any assumed mass ratio ,",
    "the masses and radii of the components can be drawn from a suitable isochrone after allowing for partition of the observed luminosity between each star in the appropriate ratio .    for a flat primordial frequency distribution of binaries , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the cumulative fraction of binaries with periods less than @xmath52 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the fraction of primordial `` hard '' binaries ( those where the orbital velocity is greater than the velocity dispersion of the cluster ) .",
    "`` soft '' binaries are expected to be quickly disrupted through interactions with other stars @xcite .",
    "the central velocity dispersion of 47 tuc is 11.6 km s@xmath62 @xcite , implying a maximum orbital period for `` hard '' binaries of @xmath22 50 years .",
    "( this limit will be smaller if a sufficient binary population exists to allow the larger cross sections of binary - binary interactions to be important in disrupting systems . )",
    "@xmath63 = 2.5 d is the minimum observed period in zero - age binary star populations @xcite .",
    "thus , for an observational sample with @xmath64 stars in each @xmath9-magnitude interval @xmath65 , the number of eclipsing binaries we expect to detect over a period range @xmath66 to @xmath67 and magnitude range @xmath68 to @xmath69 is @xmath70 which is a linear function of @xmath61 .",
    "figure  [ eclipse_probability ] shows this relation for 47 tuc , where we have used the 11 gy @xcite isochrone for the masses and radii , have assumed equal masses , and that @xmath71 .",
    "we have detected five eclipsing binaries with periods between 4 and 16 days , which implies that the primordial hard binary fraction of the cluster core is 13 @xmath72 6 % . for this calculation and in the remainder of this paper",
    "we define the binary fraction as being the number of binary stars relative to the number of main sequence stars searched .",
    "the error we quote here is due entirely to the @xmath73 poisson uncertainty in the number of detections , which far outweighs internal errors in any of the measurements or parameters .",
    "for instance , using @xmath74 increases the derived binary fraction by less than 1% and using a mass ratio @xmath75 increases the derived binary fraction by @xmath222% .",
    "we can also examine the sensitivity of our model to assumptions about the binary period cutoff and the shape of the frequency distribution . if the efficiency of disruption of binaries is much greater than expected and the upper limit to binary periods is 5 years rather than 50 years",
    ", then the binary fraction we derive is 10 @xmath72 4 % .",
    "if the frequency distribution of binaries is not flat , but rather follows the exponential function of @xcite ( found from nearby g dwarfs ) , @xmath76 , the derived binary fraction becomes 17 @xmath72 8 % .    as noted in   [ sectobservations ] , our observations are subject to bias because of radial incompleteness in the area coverage . for the eclipsing binaries considered here ,",
    "the correction factor is negligible , changing the estimated binary fraction by < 0.2 % .",
    "we can ask whether the periods of the stars we have detected are consistent with flat or exponential distributions . in practice",
    ", @xmath77 is almost independent of v , thus simplifying a search for period dependence .",
    "unfortunately two of the five eclipsing binaries being considered each show only two eclipses during the time of observation so there is a slight ambiguity as to whether these are primary and secondary eclipses ( in which case the periods are 8.87 and 10.15 d ) or primary eclipses only ( in which case the periods are half these values ) .",
    "in fact , detailed inspection of the lightcurves argues for the former . for wf4-v01 ,",
    "the depths of the two observed @xmath9band eclipses differ . for wf2-v01 ,",
    "the depths of the two observed eclipses are very similar but there is no apparent eclipse at the phase midway between them .",
    "if there was an unobserved secondary eclipse at this phase then this would place such a small upper limit on the radius of the secondary that the primary eclipse would have a flat bottom , which is not the case . in fig .",
    "[ eclipsingpfreq ] we show the cumulative period distribution compared with the models for flat and exponential distributions .",
    "the cumulative distribution is driven mainly by the geometric factor for probability of eclipses given random orientations , so in practice does not provide a good discriminant between models .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic @xcite for the maximum difference between the distributions of the flat model and observed periods is 0.33 with a formal probability of 54% that the observations are drawn from the model population .",
    "fifteen of the stars in our sample have , by visual examination , characteristic w uma lightcurves ( figs .  [ lcwuma1 ] , [ lcwuma2 ] , [ lcwuma3 ] ,",
    "table  [ tablewuma ] ) . these were initially assumed to be contact binary systems .",
    "the generally accepted theory for the formation of such systems is that detached binaries lose orbital angular momentum by a magnetic braking mechanism when their spin and orbital angular momentum become tidally coupled @xcite .",
    "the rate of approach increases as the separation decreases because the strength of the magnetic stellar wind increases with higher rotational velocities @xcite . for nearly equal mass stars ,",
    "a rapid initial mass transfer will occur after first contact is established @xcite because , for a main sequence star with a convective envelope , the roche - lobe radius shrinks faster in response to mass loss than does the stellar radius .",
    "subsequent mass - transfer oscillations ( for part of which time the system may be in a semi - detached state ) result in a system with mass ratio varying over the range @xmath78 .",
    "an important consequence is that the total luminosity of a nearly - equal - mass pre - contact binary will increase as the system adjusts to a different mass ratio @xcite .",
    "for instance , a binary with initial component masses of 0.75  @xmath47 will be brighter by 0.34 mag after it evolves to a mass ratio @xmath79 .",
    "the brighter component will also be bluer leading to a tendency for bright w uma systems to be blue stragglers .    as shown by @xcite , contact binaries",
