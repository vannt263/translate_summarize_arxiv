    "for this reason , the theory of spps on a cylinder attracted a lot of attention in the past and recent years  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath7 can experience a large exponential growth in the radial direction in the vicinity of the metal surface , meaning that the mode is not actually localized near the surface .    in our opinion , an adequate approach to the study of spps",

    "in the majority of the literature on the subject of electromagnetic waves propagation in the vicinity of a conducting cylinder , the hankel functions of the second kind are discarded with the argumentation that they describe waves that asymptotically propagate toward the cylinder .",
    "one of the main results of our paper is that we show that for a boundary condition corresponding to a lossy boundary , this is , in general , incorrect .",
    "indeed , the hankel functions in this case have large complex indices , and their asymptotic behavior is more complex than just `` outgoing '' or `` incoming '' wave criterion .",
    "we consider the distribution of the poynting vector in the vicinity of the cylinder , and make our conclusion on localization of a particular mode with account of the energy flow in the mode .",
    "our approach uses a paraxial equation to describe a surface wave at a cylindrical metal - air interface in the low frequency limit with @xmath68 .",
    "its solution is found in terms of the airy - fock functions of the first and second kind , avoiding in this way the complexities of dealing with the hankel functions of large argument and large order used in earlier studies .",
    "we have shown that surface waves of two types can exist on a curved metal boundary which we called the outgoing and incoming surface waves . inspecting the radial component @xmath128 of the poynting vector , we reveal a qualitative difference between the two types of the surface waves . in the vicinity of the metal - air interface ,",
    "the radial energy flux is directed inwards for the waves of both types as expected for a lossy medium ( ie , a realistic metal ) .",
    "however @xmath128 reverses its sign at large distances from the interface in case of the outgoing surface wave .",
    "we also emphasized that only incoming surface wave survives in the limit of planar metal - air boundary  this fact , being always known , was not properly evaluated by those authors who discarded incoming solutions in the cylindrical geometry .",
    "we have derived the dispersion relations for the waves of both types by computing the radiative corrections to the dispersion relation of a planar surface wave due to the curvature of the metal - air interface , see eqs .   and  .",
    "we found that for any value of the surface impedance there is at most one surface mode of both types .",
