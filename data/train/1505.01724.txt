    "the outstanding photoconversion properties of @xmath4 perovskites ( we will , from now on , abbreviate methyylammonium as m and methylammonium lead iodide as @xmath5 ) have been subject of an impressive number of experimental and theoretical studies in the last few years  @xcite . nowadays ,",
    "most of the key ingredients which characterize the photo - absorption properties of the system , at least in its bulk form , are understood : the large absorption coefficient in the important frequency range  @xcite the dominance of unbound electron - hole recombination over excitonic effects at room temperature  @xcite , the small band - to - band radiative recombination rate  @xcite , the long ( @xmath6  ns ) lifetime and diffusion length ( hundreds nm )  @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the great appeal of this system stems from the fact that , while processed through low - cost solid solution as organic materials , it is nevertheless assignable , for what concerns photo - absorption properties , to the category of the best crystalline semiconducting absorbers ( see refs   for a detailed comparison with gaas ) .",
    "however , several aspects are still to be fully understood .",
    "one of them concerns the incidence and typology of native defects present in these materials .",
    "the fact that these films prepared at low thermal budgets have optimal optical absorption is a clear indication of the resilience of the electronic properties against structural defects and vacancies  @xcite .",
    "experiments provide few specific indications about point defects and intra - gap electronic levels .",
    "electronic paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements detect ch@xmath0nh@xmath7 cations and pb@xmath8 paramagnetic clusters in samples which had been irradiated with intense ultraviolet light  @xcite .",
    "evidence of pb metallic clusters in @xmath5 is also given by x - ray photo - emission spectroscopy  @xcite ; ref .",
    "reports also the presence of occupied ( mainly in @xmath9-type conditions ) or empty ( mainly in @xmath3-type conditions ) intra - gap electronic levels distributed at variable energies inside the gap .",
    "indirect information about intra - gap electronic levels can also be drawn from photoluminescence ( pl ) experiments .",
    "as an example , a recent work  @xcite revealed that while transient pl spectroscopy in the high excitation density regime is dominated by unbound electron - hole radiative recombination , the steady - state pl intensity follows a 3/2-power law as a function of laser intensity ( @xmath10 ) which deviates from a purely radiative behavior ( @xmath11 ) and suggests the presence of intra - gap states .",
    "these intra - gap states can trap either electrons or holes , but not both of them simultaneously , thus indicating that these traps should be either fully occupied or empty , but not partially filled .",
    "the trapping contribution is visible up to a injected carrier density of @xmath12 , above which the radiative regime takes place and the linear behavior @xmath13 is recovered .",
    "first - principles calculations are an extremely useful approach to evaluate the presence of defects in the systems .",
    "in several recent theoretical works  @xcite ( see also refs .   for a review ) the most common point defects ( vacancies , interstitials , substitutionals , and anti - sites ) were thoroughly analyzed .",
    "it was found that the defects with the lowest formation energies ( pb vacancy and interstitial methylammonium , according to ref .  )",
    "are shallow acceptors and donors , respectively , thus coherently with the expectation of good @xmath3-type or @xmath9-type conductivity and recombination properties dominated by radiative processes . for some defects with larger formation energies ( e.g. pb interstitial and anti - site  @xcite )",
    "it is estimated by the very simplified transition - state argument that electronic levels lying well into the band gap could occur , but no explicit evidence of these defects was obtained from the calculated electronic properties . in the search for localized states evidenced by pl , in this work we use density functional theory calculations to analyze a different scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ the possibility of intra - gap electronic localization induced by the presence of interstitial molecules containing a c or n atom with a @xmath14 lone - pair .",
    "we will consider only molecules that derive from the methylammonium dissociation or deprotonation .",
    "in doing so , we assume the rather conservative viewpoint of including only moieties that respect the chemical composition and stoichiometry of the bulk perovskite .",
    "apart from the dissociation processes , these and other physically similar impurities can be introduced in @xmath5 accidentally .",
    "nicely , this limited set of cases is however sufficient to display a significant variety of defect states , whose characteristics are consistent with the pl analysis .",
    "in particular , we found that amine groups originating from the lone - pair of nitrogen molecules ( e.g. ammonia and methylamine produced by m dissociation ) have the general tendency to furnish trap states located well into the band gap .",
    "fragments containing a carbon @xmath14 lone - pair instead are generally unstable and tend to form bonded complexes with i ions . in this case",
    "all the localized electronic states are well below the valence band .",
    "this behavior is significantly influenced by the fermi level position .",
    "for example in @xmath3-type conditions the ch@xmath0nh@xmath1 fragment yields one electron to ( captures one hole from ) the valence band and loosens its bond with iodine .",
    "the hole remains thus localized on a c(@xmath14 ) state of the fragment .",
    "this intragap half filled level has been actually observed by epr  @xcite .",
    "considering these defected perovskites as starting point , we then include interstitial cl doping in the analysis ( previous calculations  @xcite only considered cl as i - substitutional in the bulk perovskite , and as such , hardly capable to change on any significant extent the photo - absorption properties of the perovskite ) . here",
    "we give evidence that additional inclusion of 2% interstitial cl in the perovskite ( thus corresponding to @xmath3-type conditions ) is capable to remove a corresponding fraction of n - derived localized states from the gap without including any additional charge localization in its own .",
    "our results provide a clear evidence of the beneficial action of cl in removing electronic localized states from the gap , and furnish a possible explanation to the increase of an order of magnitude in lifetime and diffusion length observed after cl inclusion in solution .",
    "the electronic and structural properties of the defects were computed using the density functional theory within local density approximation , as implemented in the espresso package  @xcite which is a well known plane - wave plus ultrasoft pseudopotential  @xcite code .",
    "pseudopotentials for i , c and n have projectors on @xmath15 and @xmath3 channels . for c and n the valence reference states are @xmath16 and @xmath14 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 for iodine .",
    "the pb pseudopotentials have projectors in the @xmath15 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 channels ; with reference valence states @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "all calculations were done by using a plane - waves basis set cut - off of @xmath23  ry .",
    "all the reported results are inherent to the same @xmath24 supercell ( _ i.e. _ 16 mpbi3 cubic units ) , which is the @xmath25 repetition of the tetragonal p4/mbm  @xcite unit cell .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed along a tetragonal body centered lattice with vectors @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the lattice parameters obtained by the theoretical optimization of bulk unit cell and in good agreement with those reported in ref .   for the tetragonal phase which is most stable at room temperature .",
    "an accurate treatment of pb @xmath21 states in the conduction band would require the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling  @xcite ( soc ) .",
    "soc has nonetheless small influence on energetics , structure and electronic properties of valence band and defects and represents a major increase of the computational load .",
    "for this reason , similarly to what done in many other works on this subject  @xcite we choose to discard soc .",
    "one additional advantage deriving from this choice is the quite realistic value for band gap yielded by lda ( albeit as a consequence of a fortuitous error cancelation ) .",
    "the integrations in the brillouin zone during self consistency uses a @xmath29 monkorst - pack mesh . for the density of states",
    "calculation we have used the linear tetrahedron method on a @xmath30 @xmath31-space mesh .",
    "in defect - free bulk perovskites , the m@xmath32 electronic states are well localized in space , as seen from the calculated dos in figure  [ figura_1 ] .    , valence band top is set to 0 . to better visualize the molecular levels ,",
    "they are plotted in separate panels , one for each atomic type .",
    "top panel : total dos ( green ) .",
    "bottom panels : projected dos on atomic states of methylammonium molecule .",
    "hc and hn are hydrogens bound to c and n , respectively ; black and red lines refer to s - type and p - type states . *",
    "b * : scheme of methylammonium orbital levels , as inferred for the calculated dos .",
    "[ figura_1 ] ]    the electronic structure of methylammonium embedded in the perovskite is not dissimilar to that of the isolated molecule , showing ( from bottom , relatively to the valence band top(vbt ) ) a singlet ( at @xmath33  ev ) derived from n(@xmath16)-h(@xmath34 ) hybridized states ; another singlet at @xmath35  ev from c(@xmath16)-h(@xmath34 ) hybridization ; a n(@xmath14)-h(@xmath34 ) doublet at @xmath36  ev , and another singlet at about @xmath37  ev derived from n(@xmath14)-c(@xmath14 ) states .",
    "finally , the c(@xmath14)-h(@xmath34 ) doublet at @xmath38  ev is the homo . since this states are located well below the vbt , no molecular level interferes directly with the band gap region .",
    "the same holds for the empty molecular states ( not shown here ) being the lumo well above the conduction band bottom ( cbb ) .",
    "this decoupling of extended bands ( derived from pb and i states ) with respect to the molecular states does not necessarily holds anymore if we consider configurations with methylammonium broken in c - based or n - based fragments . in the following",
    ", we will examine all the possible stoichiometric processes obtained by the fragmentation of methylammonium , giving rise to stable molecules .",
    "a neutral m ( i.e. not the m@xmath32 state of the bulk perovskite ) lacks one h to be dissociated in a couple of @xmath39 and @xmath40 molecules , which would be both stable and neutral .",
    "it follows that , forcing a starting configuration with two separated c- and n - based complexes , one of them ( the one lacking an hydrogen ) will tend to form covalent bonding with neighboring ions , while the most stable will remain located nearby the perovskite a - site . for completeness",
    "we also include in the analysis the deprotonation processes .",
    "five types of decomposition leaving at least one stable product can be hypothesized : * a * ) @xmath41 ; * b * ) @xmath42 ; * c * ) @xmath43 ; * d * ) @xmath44 ; * e * ) @xmath45 .",
    "these five processes conserve the perovskite bulk stoichiometry so that it is possible to estimate their energetic cost by direct comparison of total energies .",
    "the results for the completely separated fragments are reported in table  [ table_1 ] .",
    "the computations show that the @xmath46 fragment has a significant binding energy with @xmath39 ( @xmath47  ev ) and @xmath48 ( @xmath49  ev ) .",
    "we should notice that our structures are product of atomic relaxations which sample a limited portion of the potential energy profile .",
    "thus , we can not exclude that the same final products could be arranged in a more energetically convenient way than that found in our final state .",

    "3.22&4.28 +    as one can see in table  [ table_1 ] the formation energies @xmath55 substantially reflect the average bond enthalpy @xmath56 of the c - n bond in case of * a * ) and * b * ) configurations ( see the table ) , and of the n - h bond in case of * c * ) .",
    "since the dissociation products are stable molecules , they gain some stability at the end of the process , thus @xmath55 are actually sizably smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "these large formation energies are indeed coherent with the low concentration of localized defects indicated by the experiments",
    ". however , this should not lead to the conclusion that the final products of dissociation are unlikely , since they could form during non - equilibrium solution processing , and not necessarily through the actual thermodynamic dissociation of methylammonium .",
    "further , as reported in ref .",
    "deprotonated fragments are formed upon ultraviolet irradiation and , once created , they are stable . finally notice that these results should not be compared with those calculated for point defects in refs .  : in that case _ non - stoichiometric _ defects are considered ( e.g. vacancies , interstitials , substitutionals ) thus a suited choice of atomic chemical potentials can always favor the formation of specific defects . in the present case , all the configurations are stoichiometric , and no chemical reservoir is assumed .",
    "the resulting energies depend only on the actual energetic cost of the dissociation mechanism and do not depend on adjustable parameters . in the following we will analyze structural and electronic properties of the fragments .      following the mechanism ( a ) we forced the separation of one m in @xmath39 ( ammonia ) and @xmath57 .",
    "the former remains close to the starting m position ( i.e. the a - site of the perovskite ) and fairly stable in its ground state , with three electrons distributed in an equal number of n - h bonds , and other two in a lone - pair homo of n(@xmath14 ) orbital character . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath57  is in a highly electronegative state , it migrates toward an i atom ( also in the need of an electron to fill the valence hole , assuming a neutral m at the start ) after structural optimization , a stable @xmath58 complex ( _ `` methyl - iodide '' _ , also called _",
    "`` iodomethane '' _ ) is established , with the c - i axis lying nearly parallel to the @xmath59 square and a bond length of @xmath60 .",
    "the key feature , for what concern the photo - absorption properties , is that the n(@xmath14 ) homo level of @xmath39 is high enough in energy to overcome the whole i(@xmath18)-pb(@xmath20 ) valence band manifold ( spanning a @xmath61  ev wide energy interval ) and intrudes well within the band gap .",
    "thus , a doubly occupied donor appears @xmath62  ev above the vbt .",
    "for iodo - methane , on the other hand , the homo state is a highly stable i(@xmath18)-c(@xmath14 ) @xmath63-bond lying well below the valence band manifold , thus ineffective for what concerns the band gap region .",

    "the electronic structure of @xmath40 ( shown in figure  [ figura_3 ] ) is quite close to that of an isolated methane molecule , indicating small interaction with the inorganic surroundings .",

    "this result confirms that the formation of @xmath14 lone pair on n is energetically more favorable with respect to c.    structural and electronic properties of methylamine and iodo - metane are illustrated in the discussion of dissociation paths ( b ) and ( d ) , respectively .",
    "the 4 electronic levels stemming from ammonium valence states are all well below the i(@xmath18 ) valence band . 1 level at about @xmath72  ev and 3 almost degenerate levels at about @xmath73  ev with respect to the vbt .",

    "our calculations show that this hole is compensated by the hi formation , which produces localized @xmath75 states , thus formally subtracting one i to the pb - i bands .",

    "surprisingly , in the case of methylamine or ammonia , the filled lone pair is not ionized by @xmath3-doping , instead it shifts down in energy below the fermi level and out of the band gap .",
    "if , by an increase of hole concentration , we shift further down the fermi level , the lone - pair remains below the fermi level undergoing rigidly to the same energy shift .",
    "an outstanding consequence then results from our simulations : amine lone - pair levels can stay in the gap as long as they are fully occupied or empty , but not if partially occupied , since in this case they regain full occupancy by shifting in energy below the vbt and thus taking one electron charge from the i(@xmath18 ) valence bands . according to these results thus it is impossible to have n(@xmath14 ) lone - pair levels with partial filling .",

    "[ figura_6 ] ]    in summary , according to our results n - derived and c - derived localized in - gap states behaves quite differently : the former can never stay partially occupied in the band gap , and subtract electrons from the valence band if @xmath3-doping conditions are enforced ; the latter , on the other hand remains well within the band gap even if half - occupied .",
    "we can understand this difference on the basis of the very high electronegativity of @xmath3-doped n - h group . in comparison ,",
    "the electronegativity of c - h molecules is much lower and these latter have thus the tendency to form hybridized bonds with i ions or alternatively strip h from neighboring m molecules .",
    "finally , the total energy comparison between perovskites including methylamine and @xmath99 in the same @xmath3-type conditions ( thus directly comparable having the same number of atoms in the simulation supercell ) shows that the latter is @xmath101  ev / f.u .",

    "* b * ) electronic structure of the complex illustrated by the dos projected on the atomic orbitals of the molecules . [ figura_7 ] ]      a major conundrum concerns the capability of cl to enhance the photoconversion properties of the perovskite ; since the very first work revealing the solar cell efficiency of these systems  @xcite , the presence of cl in solution with the reactants of the perovskite was highlighted as a key ingredient to obtain power conversion efficiency ( pce ) greater than 10% .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since on the one hand , the actual amount of cl included in the perovskite was revealed to be not larger than few percent and possibly accumulated at the interfaces  @xcite ; on the other , it was realized that the isovalent cl - i substitution could bring little effect on the fundamental electronic properties of the system  @xcite ; in fact , several pl studies highlighted the fact that cl could increase the lifetime and the related diffusion length of the perovskite by an order of magnitude  @xcite , a result hardly understandable in terms of a few - percent i@xmath102cl substitutions . these considerations have motivated a thorough search of the possible mechanisms which could explain the role of cl in the perovskites . at the present ,",
    "one of the most credited hypothesis focuses on the role of the interfaces where a significant concentration of cl could be confined , thus effectively changing the photoabsorption properties  @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation , very interesting in its simplicity , is based on the hypothesis that a certain amount of native defects present in the undoped stoichiometric perovskite could be removed from the gap by the inclusion of interstitial cl , acting as a @xmath3-type dopant .",

    "the homo state of methylamine , which in absence of cl was well into the band gap , is now located just below the vbt , _",
    "i.e. _ the inclusion of cl cleans up the band gap from its occupied localized states .     and @xmath15 states .",
    "* d * ) : band structure for the same system along @xmath104 .",
    "the green line is the homo of methylamine , the blue line a hi state , both laying within the band gap before cl inclusion ( fig .",
    "[ figura_5]-d ) . [ figura_8 ] ]    this _ cleaning _ mechanism is rather transparent : cl grabs an electron from the in - gap lone - pair , which then falls down in energy as a consequence of the subtracted electrostatic repulsion .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath3-type states of cl spreads through the i(@xmath18 ) valence band region , without introducing any relevant change in the total dos , i.e the basic electronic properties of the perovskite are not disrupted by the interstitial cl , at least for the 2% concentration examined here .",
    "we emphasize that this mechanism is quite general : any @xmath9-type dopant , whatever the source , will be compensated by an equal concentration of interstitial cl subtracting one electron from the valence band manifold .",
    "in summary , we have studied by first - principles calculations the effect in the perovskites of various molecular defects .",
    "we have focused our analysis on those which can be obtained by the dissociation or fragmentation of methylammonium . for these defects",
    "the formation energies calculated by total energy differences range from about @xmath105  ev up to @xmath106  ev . accordingly",
    "their concentration is expected to be low under thermal equilibrium conditions , but it can eventually increase out of equilibrium , i.e. during synthesis or as a result of chemical contamination .",
    "our results demonstrate that some of these defects form ( either completely filled or empty ) localized levels inside the band gap , in particular those related to n(@xmath14 ) lone pairs present in ammonia and methylamine molecules derived from methylammonium dissociation .",
    "an overall account of these defects is schematically summarized in figure  [ figura_9 ] : while the electronic states of the @xmath107 molecule in the bulk perovskite lie far beyond or above the relevant band gap extremes , these molecules display either homo or lumo states well within the band gap ( specifically , the ammonia homo @xmath62  ev above the vbt , and the methylamine homo and lumo @xmath77  ev and @xmath108  ev above vbt , respectively ) .    also , we have shown that the amine lone - pair localized in the band gap are always either full or empty , since any attempt to extract an electron from the in - gap homo state results in a sudden falling of this state below the vbt . in other words ,",
    "their fractionally occupied states are never stable within the band gap .",
    "this result is in striking agreement with the interpretations of the steady - state pl experiments carried out in ref .  .",
    "at variance with amines , fragments having a c(@xmath14 ) lone - pair like @xmath85 or @xmath109 can form stable complexes by binding to i ions , but , as long as stoichiometric conditions are retained , their homo levels always remain well below the vbt .",
    "however , in @xmath3-type conditions the orbital related to c - i bond remains singly occupied thus moving into the band gap ; this is in agreement with epr evidences , reported in ref .  , of half - filled orbitals derived by the @xmath85 radical .",
    "results for p - type conditions are summarized in figure  [ figura_10 ] .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the inclusion of interstitial cl in the perovskite .",
    "our results show that an amount of 2% interstitial cl is capable to remove from the band gap from an equal amount of n - derived lone - pair homo states of methylamine or ammonia , and at the same time does not disrupt the fundamental electronic properties of the perovskite .",
    "our results build a sound conceptual fundament to the observed enhancement of lifetime and diffusion length caused by the inclusion of cl in the solution processing of the perovskite .",
    "-type doping ; ( left ) the molecular level of the methyl - type fragment is able to trap one hole and it forms a singly occupied level right in the gap ; ( right ) the lone pair of the methylamine fragment is always doubly occupied , and shifts below the fermi level in @xmath3-type conditions .
