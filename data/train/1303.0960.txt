    "the search for resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath1-cluster ( @xmath2=@xmath3 ) nuclei in the energy regime from the coulomb barrier up to regions with excitation energies of @xmath4=20@xmath550  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question of how quasimolecular resonances may reflect continuous transitions from scattering states in the ion - ion potential to true cluster states in the compound systems is still unresolved @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with alpha - clustering phenomena @xcite , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach , the cranked @xmath1-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite . in light",
    "@xmath1-like nuclei clustering is observed as a general phenomenon at high excitation energy close to the @xmath1-decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "this exotic behavior has been perfectly illustrated by the famous `` ikeda''-diagram for @xmath2=@xmath3 nuclei in 1968 @xcite , which has been recently extended by von oertzen @xcite for neutron - rich nuclei , as shown in the left panel of fig.1 .",
    "clustering is a general phenomenon @xcite not only observed in light neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , but also in halo nuclei such as @xmath6li @xcite or @xmath7be , for instance @xcite . the problem of cluster formation has also been treated extensively for very heavy systems by r.g .",
    "gupta @xcite and by zagrebaev and w. greiner @xcite where giant molecules and the collinear ternary fission may exist @xcite .",
    "the real link between superdeformation ( sd ) , nuclear molecules and alpha clustering @xcite is of particular interest , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation for light nuclei ( with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath8 @xmath9 0.6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes ( hyperdeformation ( hd ) with @xmath8 @xmath9 1.0 ) has also been discussed for actinide nuclei @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "typical examples for possible relationship between quasimolecular bands and extremely deformed ( sd / hd ) shapes have been widely discussed in the literature for @xmath10 @xmath1-conjugate @xmath2=@xmath3 nuclei , such as @xmath11si @xcite , @xmath12s @xcite , @xmath13ar @xcite , @xmath14ca @xcite , @xmath15ti @xcite , @xmath16cr @xcite and @xmath17ni @xcite .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been discovered in several light @xmath1-conjugate ( @xmath2=@xmath3 ) nuclei , such as @xmath13ar and @xmath14ca by using @xmath18-ray spectroscopy techniques @xcite . in particular , the extremely deformed rotational bands in @xmath13ar @xcite ( shown as crosses in fig .",
    "2 ) might be comparable in shape to the quasimolecular bands observed in both @xmath0c+@xmath19 mg @xcite ( shown as open triangles in fig .  2 ) and @xmath20o+@xmath21ne @xcite ( shown as full rectangles ) reactions .",
    "ternary clusterizations are also predicted theoretically , but were not found experimentally in @xmath13ar so far @xcite . on the other hand , ternary fission of @xmath17ni  related to its hyperdeformed shapes  was identified from out - of - plane angular correlations measured in the @xmath12s+@xmath19 mg reaction with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) at the vivitron tandem facility of the iphc , strasbourg @xcite .",

    "are the main ingredients .",
    "actually , the @xmath7c nucleus may play similar role in clusterization as the @xmath20o one since it has similar properties as a cluster : i ) it has closed neutron p - shells , ii ) first excited states are well above e@xmath22 = 6 mev , and iii ) it has high binding energies for @xmath1-particles .",

    "we will only present recent results on the even - even oxygen isotopes : @xmath38o @xcite and @xmath21o @xcite .",

    "4 gives an overview of all bands in @xmath38o as a plot of excitation energies as a function of j(j+1 ) together with their respective moments of inertia . in the assignment of the bands both",
    "the dependence of excitation energies on j(j+1 ) and the dependence of measured cross sections on 2j+1 @xcite were considered .",
    "slope parameters obtained in a linear fit to the excitation energies @xcite indicate the moment of inertia of the rotational bands given in fig .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the cluster bands is reflection asymmetric , the parity projection gives an energy splitting between the partner bands .",
    "the assignment of the experimental molecular bands are supported by either generator - coordinate - method @xcite or antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations @xcite",
    ".    we can compare the bands of @xmath21o @xcite shown in fig .  5 with those of @xmath38o displayed in fig .  4 .",
    "the first doublet ( k=0@xmath41 ) has a slightly larger moment of inertia ( smaller slope parameter ) in @xmath21o , which is consistent with its interpretation as @xmath7c@xmath42he or @xmath20c@xmath43he molecular structures ( they start well below the thresholds of 16.8 mev and 12.32 mev , respectively ) . the second band , for which the negative parity partner is yet to be determined , has a slope parameter slightly smaller than in @xmath38o .",
    "this is consistent with the study of the bands in @xmath21o by furutachi et al .",
    "@xcite , which clearly establishes parity inversion doublets predicted by amd calculations for the @xmath7c@xmath44he cluster and @xmath7c-2n-@xmath1 molecular structures .",
    "the corresponding moments of inertia given in fig .  4 and fig .",
    "5 are strongly suggesting large deformations for the cluster structures .",
    "we may conclude that the reduction of the moments of inertia of the lowest bands of @xmath45o is consistent with the assumption that the strongly bound @xmath7c nucleus having equivalent properties to @xmath20o , has a similar role as @xmath20o in relevant , less neutron rich nuclei .",
    "therefore , the ikeda - diagram @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath20o cluster cores with covalently bound neutrons @xcite must be further extended to include also the @xmath7c cluster cores as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "the connection of @xmath1-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , orbiting phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) has been discussed in this work by using @xmath18-ray spectroscopy of coincident binary fragments from either inelastic excitations and direct transfers ( with small energy damping and spin transfer ) or from orbiting ( fully damped ) processes @xcite in the @xmath19mg+@xmath0c reaction . from a careful analysis of the @xmath20o+@xmath21ne @xmath1-transfer exit - channel",
    "( strongly populated by orbiting ) new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath25 state of @xmath20o at 11.089  mev .",
    "this result is encouraging for a complete @xmath18-ray spectroscopy of the @xmath20o nucleus at high excitation energy .",
    "in addition , we have presented new results on neutron - rich oxygen isotopes displaying very well defined molecular bands in agreement with amd predictions .",
    "consequently , the extended ikeda diagram has been further extended for light neutron - rich nuclei by inclusion of the @xmath7c cluster , similarly to the @xmath20o one .",
    "of particular interest is the quest for the 4@xmath1 states of @xmath20o near the @xmath36be+@xmath36be and @xmath0c+@xmath1 decay thresholds , which correspond to the so - called  hoyle `` state . the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath18-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future since such states are most certainly going to decay by particle emission ( see @xcite ) .",
