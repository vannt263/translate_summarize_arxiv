    "processes involving particle production in the presence of classical electromagnetic fields @xmath1 can be considered in the context of semi - classical approximation , in which the source particle is described by a classical current with a prescribed trajectory and the emitted particles are considered as fully quantized fields . for the case of",
    "accelerated protons , the inertially forbidden decays via the strong interaction channel like , for instance , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and via the weak channel , as @xmath4 , have been studied in detail in the semi - classical approximation . for the case of motion under magnetic fields ,",
    "the validity of the semi - classical approximation is warranted if , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the magnetic field measured in the instantaneous reference frame of the proton , @xmath7 is the usual lorentz factor , and @xmath8 g is a critical value for the magnetic field , denoting the region where a full quantized analysis is mandatory .",
    "provided that condition ( [ chifactor ] ) is obeyed , the semi - classical calculations are accurate and the associated emitted power depends only on the proper acceleration of the source @xcite . for the case of a magnetic field @xmath9 , for instance , the proper acceleration of a ( relativistic ) proton is @xmath10 and , consequently , eq .",
    "( [ chifactor ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath11 the parameter @xmath12 can be defined in a frame independent way as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for the proton momentum . for the case of inertially",
    "forbidden particle production , as those ones explicitly listed above , one naturally expects a strong suppression for quasi - inertiall @xmath15 protons .",
    "we review here the role played by the proper acceleration @xmath0 of the source in the massive particle production , with emphasis on the ranges favoring the massive particle emission channels .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of observing signals of curvature pion radiation from accelerated protons in the magnetosphere of strongly magnetized pulsars . unless otherwise stated , natural units where @xmath16 and the spacetime signature @xmath17 are adopted through this work .",
    "we consider here the following kind of decay process @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the source particles , described by a classical current corresponding to the states of a two level system following a prescribed classical trajectory with proper acceleration @xmath0 , and @xmath21 are the emitted particles , described by quantized fields .",
    "( for further details , see @xcite , for instance . )",
    "we assume that the respective masses @xmath22 of the emitted particles @xmath21 obeys @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 stands for , respectively , the masses of the source particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 , the process is known to be forbidden for inertial trajectories ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is intuitive to expect that , if the source is supposed to follow a prescribed trajectory , the momentum @xmath30 of the emitted particle @xmath31 , measured in the rest frame of the source , must be constrained to @xmath32@xcite . moreover ,",
    "the mean energy @xmath33 of the emitted particles ( also measured in the proton s reference frame ) is of the order of the source proper acceleration@xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 then , from the condition @xmath35 and @xmath36 without loss of generality , let us assume a uniformly accelerated trajectory along the @xmath37 direction with worldline given by @xmath38 following the same procedure employed in the refs .",
    "@xcite , one obtains the differential decay rate as function of the energy of the emitted pion @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath41 , @xmath42 mev is the @xmath43 mass , and @xmath44 is the effective coupling constant .",
    "the total emitted power is @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the meijer g - function@xcite . the corresponding normalized energy distribution , @xmath47 is plotted in fig.([energy ] ) ,     field for different values of the proper acceleration of the proton",
    ". full line : a = 150 mev , dashed line : a = 500 mev.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    from which it is clear that mean energy of the emitted particles are @xmath48 . from ( [ threshold ] ) and fig.([energy ] ) , one can argue that , if the acceleration is such that @xmath49 the corresponding process ( [ general ] ) becomes energetically favored .",
    "in fact , more precise estimates reveal that the threshold is @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the neutral pion production ( [ scalarmeson1 ] ) is expected do be favored for @xmath52 mev . for the physical relevant case of protons in circular motion , one has also exactly the same threshold ( [ scalarmeson ] ) . for such case , the formulas for the neutral pion production ( [ scalarmeson1 ] ) can be obtained from the previously one calculated in @xcite for scalar emissions @xmath53 we notice that , in order to obtain that the total power emission ( [ powerscalar ] ) from eq .",
    "( 4.7 ) of @xcite , one must perform the following modifications on the particle states : @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 is related to the strong coupling constant @xmath56 by @xmath57 the large difference between the strong and the electromagnetic coupling constants will imply a large difference also in the respective emitted powers .",
    "the comparison between ( [ powerscalar ] ) and the larmor formula for the usual synchrotron radiation shows that @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "hence , if the proper acceleration of a proton reach the value @xmath60 , the channel ( [ scalarmeson1 ] ) is expect to dominate over the usual synchrotron radiation emission",
    ".    it must be emphasized that the formalism presented here can not be applied when the charge currents corresponding to initial and final states are different .",
    "neutral and charged particles follow distinct trajectories in the presence of an electromagnetic field . the related channel @xmath61 for example , requires a different semi - classical formalism .",
    "the formalism and the respective calculations can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "pulsar magnetospheres offer many interesting possibilities to test these results involving high energy accelerated particles@xcite .",
    "let us consider , for this purpose , the simplest polar cap models of pulsars @xcite .",
    "for such models , a proton interacts with the dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar and is accelerated by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the transverse to the magnetic field component @xmath62 of the proton momentum vanish rapidly due to the usual synchrotron emission .",
    "the protons are accelerated along the magnetic field lines by the electric potential drop of the pulsar , producing photons by curvature radiation .",
    "a particle following a circular trajectory of radius @xmath63 has proper centripetal acceleration given by @xmath64 .",
    "the curvature radius @xmath63 of the magnetic field line of a pulsar is related to the radius @xmath65 of the star and to the light cone radius , @xmath66 through @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the star period .",
    "then , one has @xmath69 the @xmath70 factor accounts for the efficiency of the polar cap acceleration mechanism @xcite @xmath71 .",
    "also , @xmath72 is the maximum available potential drop near the surface of the star @xcite . taking for a typical young pulsar @xmath73 m",
    ", one has from ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ scalarmeson ] ) , the following condition on the star surface magnetic field @xmath74 for the occurrence of pion emission with non negligible intensity .",
    "it is easily verified that even for @xmath75 , the condition ( [ final ] ) is far above of the known pulsars of the atnf catalogue@xcite , see fig .",
    "2 . in fact , a systematic search in the atnf pulsar catalogue for strongly magnetized stars that could accelerate relativistic protons up to the curvature pion production threshold reveals that the best candidate is the 16 ms pulsar j0537 - 6910 , but the corresponding characteristic parameter @xmath76 is too small to give origin to observable signals @xcite .     for the 1700 objects in the atnf pulsar",

    "the shadowed region corresponds to the condition ( 3.3 ) .",
    "all the pulsars in the atnf catalogue are far below the pion production threshold.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0%][bp ]",
    "we have briefly reviewed the role played by the source proper acceleration in the semi - classical approximation for the process of massive particle emission .",
    "unfortunately , we have from eq.([final ] ) and fig .",
    "2 that the necessary threshold for pion production by protons in circular motion is far above the typical acceleration experimented by protons in pulsar magnetospheres . nevertheless , it would be also interesting to investigate , in this context , other radiative processes like photopion production and the inverse compton scattering .",
