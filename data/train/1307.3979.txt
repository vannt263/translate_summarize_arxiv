    "the monolayer consists of polystyrene beads with ( 4.5 @xmath60 m diameter ) doped with iron oxide ( dynabeads^^ 4.5 , invitrogen ) making them superparamagnetic .",
    "the beads are sedimented by gravity to an otherwise interaction free interface of a hanging droplet spanned by surface tension in a top sealed cylindrical hole ( 4 mm in diameter ) of an optical cuvette . the thermal activation height ( out of plane motion )",
    "is less than 20 nm and is therefore neglected .",
    "computer controlled regulation loops counting particle numbers and measuring their size relative to focal plane guarantee the flatness of the water - air interface .",
    "this is done by adjusting the volume of the droplet in sub - nanoliter units with a micro - syringe driven by a micro - stage with a frequency of @xmath610.1 hz . to align the whole setup with respect to gravity",
    "the experiment is mounted on a flexible tripod steered by an inclination sensor .",
    "this way changes in inclination are suppressed below @xmath62 rad and spatial density variations are less than @xmath63 in the field of view .",
    "the monitored area is @xmath64 @xmath60m@xmath65 recorded with a ccd - camera of @xmath66 pixels ( marlin f 145-b ) , containing about @xmath67 particles , whereas the whole monolayer consists of up to @xmath68 particles .",
    "an elaborated description of the experimental setup can be found in @xcite .",

    "a cutoff of @xmath70 for the interactions was used together with cell lists to accelerate the simulations .",
    "the system is studied with metropolis monte carlo simulations at constant particle number , box size and temperature .",
    "trial moves consist of single particle displacements carried out with a maximum displacement size selected to obtain an average acceptance probability of about 50% .",
    "the simulation time scale is mapped to the physical time scale by comparing the self diffusion constants in the liquid state obtained from simulations and experiments ( see supplementary information ) . in all our experiments and simulations @xmath71 leading to a young s modulus of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "to monitor the long time diffusion of the defect strings , we determine the mean square displacement @xmath73 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] of the center of mass @xmath6 of the string endpoints .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath74 is estimated by least square fit to the relation @xmath75 giving the diffusion constants shown in fig . 2 of the main text .",
    "to relate the physical time and the time scale @xmath76 of the simulation corresponding to one monte carlo sweep , we have determined the diffusion constant of a particle in the fluid , which is also known experimentally @xcite . for @xmath77 particles and @xmath78 , the monte carlo simulation yields a diffusion constant of @xmath79 . from the experimental diffusion constant @xmath80 one obtains @xmath81 for the time scale of the simulation .",
    "a quantitative description of the dynamics of defect strings requires the accurate identification and location of dislocations and vacancies . here , we identify dislocations as pairs of particles with @xmath17 and @xmath82 neighbors , respectively @xcite .",
    "neighbor numbers are determined using a voronoi analysis @xcite .",
    "the position of a dislocation is defined to be at the center of mass of the @xmath17- and @xmath82-coordinated particles and the burgers vector of the dislocation is orthogonal to the vector pointing from the @xmath17- to the @xmath82-coordinated particle .",
    "single vacancies can , in principle , also be identified from the position of the dislocations associated with them @xcite . however ,",
    "if vacancies form a cluster , some dislocations annihilate and the individual positions of the defects can not be resolved any longer . here , we identify vacancies based on a underlying reference lattice consisting of a perfect triangular crystal with the density of the defect free crystal . the defect identification consist of the following steps : each particle is first assigned to its closest perfect lattice site . the perfect lattice is then positioned to minimize the sum of distances between particles and the assigned lattices sites . with this step",
    ", the lattice follows the center - of - mass motion of the crystal .",
    "the positions of the vacancies are then identified as the position of unoccupied lattice sites .",
    "this procedure to locate vacancies is robust and the number of vacancies is constant throughout the simulation even if the vacancies assemble into a string .",
    "as explained in the main text , the dynamics of vacancy strings consist of long gliding periods interrupted by rotation events at which the direction of motion of the string changes . the rotation rate @xmath83 is the number @xmath84 of rotation events that have occurred during the time @xmath85 . to determine the rotation rate , we identify the orientation of the strings at each time step and detect rotation events based on changes in the string orientation .",
    "the string orientation is defined by the relative position of the dislocations that terminate the strings and it coincides with the direction of the burgers vectors .",
    "the string orientation is undefined at the rotation points , where the string can change between two orientations .",

    "the separation vector for a string of @xmath19 vacancies can be written as @xmath55 and the burgers vectors are given @xmath53 , @xmath54 . using the",
    "dimensionless variable @xmath33 one then obtains @xmath88 where the free energy has been shifted to vanish at its minimum value .",
    "this function has the shape of a symmetric double well with minima located at at @xmath89 .",

    "3 of the main paper , the effective dislocation interactions extracted from our experiments and simulations display the double - well form predicted by elasticity theory for sufficiently long strings .",
    "a more detailed comparison is provided in the following .     of the local minima as a function of string length @xmath19 obtained from simulations ( red ) and experiments ( blue ) .",
    "for @xmath59 the prediction of elasticity theory ( black horizontal line ) is in excellent agreement with experiment and simulations.,width=264 ]    the positions @xmath12 of the minima obtained from the experiment and simulations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relativeerrors ] together with the prediction of elasticity theory shown as horizontal line . for strings of more than @xmath59 vacancies , both experiment and simulation agree very well with elasticity theory . for short strings with @xmath91",
    ", however , the double - well form disappears and the minimum shifts to @xmath47 .",
    "obtained as a function of the string length @xmath19 from simulations ( red ) compared to the predictions of elasticity theory ( black horizontal line ) . while for short strings the barrier disappears , for long strings it converges to a constant value which exceeds the prediction of elasticity theory by about 50 % .,width=264 ]    barrier heights @xmath92 obtained for different string lengths @xmath19",
    "are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : relativeerrors_barrier ] . since the statistics of the experimental measurements are insufficient for an accurate determination of barrier heights , only simulation results are shown .",
    "while elasticity theory predicts a barrier height of @xmath93 independent of string length , the barrier height determined in our simulations vanishes for @xmath34 and then grows with string length until it converges to a constant value for strings consisting of more than about @xmath94 vacancies .",
    "the barrier height obtained for long strings exceeds the elasticity theory value by about 50% .",
    "while one expects elasticity theory to break down at small distances , the origin of this discrepancy observed in the long string limit is unclear and might be due to non - linear interactions .",
