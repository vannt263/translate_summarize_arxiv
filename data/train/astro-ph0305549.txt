    "the number density of galaxy clusters , as a function of mass , is an excellent indicator for the normalization and slope of the power spectrum of the density fluctuations in the present - day universe .",
    "the power spectrum normalization is traditionally expressed in terms of @xmath6 , the _ rms _ amplitude of the density fluctuations on the @xmath7  mpc scale . in the cdm cosmology , the shape of the present - day power spectrum is controlled almost completely by the product @xmath8 ( bond & efstathiou 1984 ) .",
    "therefore , the cluster mass function is a sensitive probe of these cosmological parameters .",
    "considerable progress in the theoretical models of structure formation in the past decade has provided a reliable machinery to compute the shape of the power spectrum for any given set of cosmological parameters ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 , eisenstein & hu 1998 ) , and to predict the mass function of collapsed objects ( clusters ) given the power spectrum ( jenkins et al.2001 ) .",
    "most of the problems with using the cluster mass function as a cosmological probe are on the observational side .",
    "theory operates with the virial masses of clusters .",
    "however , the total cluster mass within the virial radius , as opposed to the mass within a small metric radius , is notoriously difficult to measure . the main techniques such as weak lensing , the x - ray method assuming hydrostatic equilibrium of the intracluster gas , and velocity dispersion of cluster galaxies , lead to significant statistical and systematic uncertainties at large radii , and often produce contradictory results ( see e.g. , markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 and fischer & tyson 1997 for representative uncertainty estimates for the x - ray hydrostatic and weak lensing methods , respectively ) .",
    "it is probably fair to say that total masses at the virial radius can not be determined to better than 3040% accuracy at present .",
    "because of the difficulties with the virial mass measurement , a direct derivation of the mass function for a large , complete sample of clusters is not feasible at present .",
    "therefore , the cluster mass is usually related to a more easily measured quantity .",
    "consider one of the most frequently used proxies for the mass function , the cluster temperature function .",
    "this relies on the theoretically expected tight correlation @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretically expected slope of the @xmath10 correlation is reproduced both in numerical simulations ( evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ) and observationally , within a given approach to the total mass measurement ( horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 ; nevalainen , markevitch & forman 2000 ; finoguenov , reiprich & bhringer 2001 ) . however , the normalizations of the @xmath10 relation derived by different authors span a wide range ( see evrard et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) .",
    "ultimately , the question of the normalization of the @xmath10 relation boils down to the possibility of total mass measurements with small systematic uncertainties , which is at the limits of current observational techniques .",
    "the expected cluster mass functions are very steep and therefore any change in the mass scale leads to large variations of the derived cosmological parameters . in a recent review , rosati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated that 30% uncertainties in the normalization of the @xmath10 relation leads to a 20% uncertainties in @xmath6 and 30% uncertainties in @xmath11 derived from cluster evolution . until the @xmath10 relation is reliably normalized , precise measurements of the cosmological power spectrum from the cluster temperature function are impossible .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to explore new proxies for the cluster mass function that would not require absolute measurements of the total mass . in this paper",
    ", we propose that such a proxy can be based on the easily measured cluster baryon masses .    indeed",
    ", it is expected that the fraction of baryons in the virial mass of clusters equals the average value in the universe  @xmath12 ( white et al .",
    "therefore , the baryon fraction is the same for clusters of any mass at any redshift at least to a first approximation .",
    "this is one of the best - proved cluster - related facts , that is justified by basic theory , confirmed by numerical simulations ( e.g. , frenk et al .",
    "1998 ) , and supported observationally ( mohr , mathiesen & evrard 1999 , allen et al . 2002 ) . given the universality of the baryon fraction , there is a trivial relation between the cumulative total and baryon mass functions : @xmath13 the average baryon density in this equation is fixed by either the big bang nucleosynthesis theory or by the cosmic microwave background fluctuations , @xmath14 ( spergel et al .",
    "the baryon mass is a convenient proxy for the total mass because 1 ) it is easily derived from the x - ray imaging observations (  [ sec : m_b : meas ] ) , and 2 ) the scaling between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is expressed in terms of the model parameters ( @xmath17 ) and therefore does not rely on the absolute total mass measurements . in this paper , we apply this method to _ rosat _ observations of a complete flux - limited sample of 52 low - redshift clusters selected from the all - sky survey data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : cluster - sample ] , we describe selection of our cluster sample",
    ". the measurements of the baryon masses are presented in  [ sec : m_b : meas ] and the baryon mass function is derived in  [ sec : mfun ] . the theory involved in modeling the baryon mass function",
    "is reviewed in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we derive constraints on @xmath6 and on the shape parameter , @xmath18 , and discuss the dependence of these results on our basic assumption of the universality of the baryon fraction .    numerical values of the cluster parameters are quoted for the @xmath19  km  s@xmath20  mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 cosmology .",

    "determination of @xmath6 from various datasets at @xmath24 is a well - established field and so a comparison of our results with at least some recent relevant studies is in order .",
    "our results can be most directly compared with the determination of @xmath6 from the cluster abundance data .",
    "most such studies use the cluster temperature as a proxy for the total mass and a normalization of the local temperature function at @xmath25  kev as the primary observable .",
    "a review of recent results from the temperature function can be found in pierpaoli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . as we noted before",
    ", the scatter in the derived values of @xmath6 in this method is mostly due to different assumptions regarding the normalization of the @xmath10 relation .",

    "our @xmath6 is lower than the determination from the optical cluster mass function by girardi et al.(1998 ) .",
    "however , our value ( for @xmath21 ) is consistent with the analyses of bahcall et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who used the cluster mass function estimated from the sloan digital sky survey , and of melchiorri et al.(2003 ) who combined the sdss results with the pre-_wmap _ cmb measurements .",

    "2003 ) to estimate the total mass function .",
    "our results on @xmath6 are in a good agreement with these works ( for @xmath26 ) .",
    "reiprich & bhringer also fit the shape of their mass function to derive @xmath28 .",
    "this is consistent but on the low side of our confidence intervals ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 - 2sig.contour ] ) , likely because reiprich & bhringer used the press - schechter approximation for the mass function in their modeling which is less accurate than the jenkins et al .",
    "fit employed here .",
    "matter density fluctuations can be traced by the spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "two modern surveys , sdss and 2df ( york et al .",
    "2000 , colless et al .",

    "the galaxy power spectrum from 2df implies @xmath29 ( percival et al .",
    "2001 ) , consistent with our results for the baseline model .    using clusters as tracers of large scale structure is also a promising approach to determine the matter power spectrum . using the power spectrum of 426 clusters from the reflex survey ( bhringer et al .",

    "( 2003 ) determine @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "note that this method is probably less sensitive to the normalization of the @xmath32 relation than using the normalization of the xtf or xlf because the bias factor changes more slowly than the spatial density of clusters as a function of mass ( mo & white 1996 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that our results are in good agreement with the schuecker et al .",
    "values .",
    "finally , @xmath6 can be determined from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the recent _ wmap _ measurements of the cmb angular fluctuations and thompson optical depth of the universe indicate @xmath33 assuming pure cdm , @xmath34 , and some other common cosmological priors ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) ; this is higher than , but consistent with , our value .",
    "we have derived the baryon mass function for galaxy clusters at a median redshift @xmath35 .",
    "the baryon ( gas+stars ) mass is measured within a radius of mean baryon overdensity @xmath36 , using direct deprojection of the rosat x - ray imaging data ( for gas mass ) and an established correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( for stellar mass ) .",
    "we argue that if the baryon fraction in cluster is nearly universal , the baryon mass function is an excellent proxy for the total mass function  @xmath39 is obtained from @xmath40 simply by a constant log shift along the mass axis .",
    "in fact , @xmath40 contains enough information to derive the amplitude and slope of the density fluctuations at cluster scales , even if the absolute value of @xmath41 is unknown .",
    "using this method we obtain @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the baryon mass function method has an important advantage in that it does not rely on rather uncertain observational determinations of the total cluster mass .",
    "the tradeoff is the sensitivity of the derived values of @xmath6 and @xmath8 to other cosmological parameters ( such as @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "our method is also sensitive to any significant deviations of the cluster baryon fraction from universality (  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "however , the good agreement of our results with a large number of measurements by other , independent methods (  [ sec : comparison ] ) shows that our assumptions about the weak trends in the baryon fraction are reasonable .",
    "we hope that future progress in observations and physical models of the icm will reduce this uncertainty to such a level that easily measurable baryon masses can be used as a reliable proxy for the total mass at all redshifts .",
