    "the discussion and quantitative calculation of the spin dynamics in dms , a quantum kinetic theory based on a correlation expansion has been introduced@xcite where the exchange interaction between free carriers and the @xmath2 electrons of the mn impurities was modelled by a kondo hamiltonian .",
    "the full quantum kinetic theory is , however , numerically challenging and the physical interpretation requires some effort .",
    "hence , it is a difficult task to efficiently implement other mechanisms of spin exchange and dephasing into the theory in order to account for effects that are in many cases needed for a proper description of real experiments like , e.  g. , the dyakonov - perel@xcite , elliot - yafet@xcite and bir - aronov - pikus@xcite mechanisms .",
    "however , it was already shown that for three dimensional systems in which the number of mn impurities @xmath3 exceeds the number of free carriers @xmath4 , a simplification of the quantum kinetic theory can be established that reasonably reproduces results in the case of a vanishing initial mn magnetization@xcite .",
    "this was achieved by a perturbative treatment of the carrier - impurity interaction as well as the assumption of a short memory .",
    "this procedure yielded the same rate equations as fermi s golden rule .",
    "in contrast , for a nonzero average mn spin these rate equations were shown to describe only the electron spin component perpendicular to the mn spin well , while a discrepancy in the dynamics of the parallel electron spin component could be attributed to neglected terms of higher than leading order in the coupling constant @xmath5 of the kondo hamiltonian ( [ eq : kondoham ] ) in the perturbative derivation of the rate equations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we derive approximate equations of motion for the electron spins in the spirit of the equations in ref .",
    "@xcite , but take the higher order corrections into account .",
    "these equations describe the effects of the precession of the electron spins around the effective magnetic field due to the mn magnetization and effectively account for a precession - type dynamics of the electron - mn correlations that has been identified previously in ref .",
    "the resulting _ precession of electron spins and correlations _ ( pesc ) equations are then discussed and their markov limit is established which can be solved analytically .",
    "numerical calculations show that for @xmath6 these analytical solutions coincide with the results of the full quantum kinetic theory , at least in three dimensional systems .",
    "the simplicity of the pesc equations makes it possible to easily interpret the basic physical processes involved in the quantum kinetic theory and allows the pesc equations to provide a suitable framework for further studies of non - markovian effects as well as of the interplay between the @xmath7-@xmath2 interaction and other mechanisms of spin relaxation and dephasing .",
    "it is noteworthy that the derived effective equations are expected to be applicable not only for the spin dynamics in dms , but they can easily be extended to describe more generally any system , in which a continuum of states is coupled to localized magnetic impurities via a kondo - like hamiltonian @xmath8 where in the case of dms @xmath9 and @xmath10 describe creation and annihilation operators for conduction band electrons with wave vector @xmath11 in the subband @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the corresponding single - particle energies , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the spin operators while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the positions of the @xmath18-th mn ion and the @xmath19-th electron , respectively .",
    "similar magnetic interactions can also arise from nuclear spins due to the fermi contact interaction or an effective interaction between conduction band electrons and localized states , such as in quantum dots , or quasi - particles , e.  g. excitons , in a huge variety of systems ranging from semiconductor heterostructures to novel materials such as graphene or dichalcogenides , since the main difference between these systems lies in the details of the single - particle band structures .",
    "therefore , the equations of motion studied here are of prototypical character for the spin dynamics of extended systems .    the article is outlined as follows : first , we summarize the quantum kinetic theory and reproduce the basic equations of motion where we restrict ourselves to the terms that were shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be numerically important in the case @xmath6 . in a next step ,",
    "we apply a rotating - wave - like approximation and derive the pesc equations of motion for the electron spins and occupations .",
    "then , the markov limit of the pesc equations is introduced , and the thereby described physical effects are discussed ; in particular the spectral redistribution of electrons as well as pauli blocking effects are shown to arise naturally on this level of theory . subsequently , analytical solutions to the markov limit of the pesc equations are presented and compared with numerical results of the full quantum kinetic theory .",

    "[ fig : doppelfermi ] ( b ) essentially follow the original step functions for the two spin orientations , but since the edges are smoothed due to the non - markovian deviations from the delta distribution in the memory , they resemble fermi distributions with an finite effective temperature .    . in ( b ) , the occupations are plotted for calculations based on the full quantum kinetic theory with and without the terms @xmath148 accounting for pauli blocking . ]",
    "we have derived effective equations of motion [ cf .",
    "( 7 ) ] for the conduction band electron spins and occupations starting from a microscopic quantum kinetic theory using a rotating - wave - like ansatz .",
    "these equations account for the precession of the electron spins around the effective magnetic field due to the mn magnetization as well as for a precession - like dynamics of the electron - mn correlation functions .",
    "therefore , in this article they are referred to as _ precession of electron spins and correlations _ ( pesc ) equations .",
    "the pesc equations can be more easily interpreted as the original quantum kinetic equations .",
    "they also provide an important speed - up of the numerics , in particular , when the markov limit of the pesc equations is used .",
    "the spin dynamics for high mn doping in three dimensional systems derived from our effective equations in the markov limit are demonstrated by numerical calculations to agree well with the corresponding results of the original quantum kinetic theory .",
    "this resolves the deficiency of the golden rule - type rate equations of ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a finite initial impurity magnetization .",
    "even though the pesc equations can in principle describe non - markovian effects as well as pauli blocking , the numerical studies suggest that these are of minor importance for the time evolution of the total electron spin polarization , at least for the situations studied in this paper .    the markov limit of the pesc eqs .  ( 12 ) can be readily interpreted : for a positive coupling constant @xmath5 , spin - up electrons can gain energy in the mean field due to the mn magnetization by a spin - flip process to the spin - down subband . due to the total energy conservation , this energy is transformed into kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , a spin - up state couples effectively only to a spin - down state with a kinetic energy @xmath116 greater than the spin - up state energy and vice - versa .",
    "the resulting equation can be solved analytically yielding a time dependence of the electron spin polarization following a tanh - function .",
    "if the pauli blocking terms are neglected , the equations are solved by a simple decaying exponential function with a rate that can also be obtained by applying fermi s golden rule , if the mean field energy of an electron in the effective field of the mn magnetization is included into the single particle energies .",
    "numerical studies of the energetic redistribution of the electrons in the full quantum kinetic theory support the findings of the delta - like coupling of states in energy space in general , but slight deviations from this markovian prediction can be seen especially in the smoothing of sharp edges of the initial electron occupations .",
    "it is expected that the non - markovian features will be more important in two - dimensional systems@xcite .",
    "the pesc equations in the markov limit derived in this paper can provide a suitable framework for further investigations of these effects .",
    "in addition , their numerical simplicity allows for the introduction of other mechanisms of spin relaxation to study reliably their competition with the @xmath7-@xmath2 exchange interaction which would be a demanding task within the original quantum kinetic theory ."
