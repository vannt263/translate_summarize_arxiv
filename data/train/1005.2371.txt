    "there are numerous examples of two - dimensional field theories that are invariant under the full conformal group . in four dimensions ,",
    "the beta function of @xmath11 super yang - mills is known to vanish to all orders in perturbation theory , for any value of the coupling , so that the theory is scale invariant .",
    "other theories have isolated zeroes of the beta function that correspond to fixed points of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow .",
    "for instance , the gauge coupling @xmath12 in qcd flows to zero as the energy scale is increased , leading to the well - known phenomenon of asymptotic freedom ; in this case @xmath13 is commonly called an uv fixed point . on the other hand ,",
    "if a theory has an ir fixed point ( irfp ) , the couplings will flow to such a fixed point at large distances , and the theory becomes scale invariant in the large  distance regime .",
    "theories with an irfp do not break chiral symmetry spontaneously , and are said to lie in the _",
    "conformal window_.    supersymmetric examples of theories within the conformal window have been studied in detail - see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in identifying non - supersymmetric gauge theories with an irfp .",
    "the main motivation , besides intrinsic interest , comes from the fact that theories _ near _ the conformal window correspond to the class of theories underlying walking technicolor  @xcite , which is the phenomenologically most viable offspring of technicolor theories  @xcite . a chirally broken theory near the edge of the conformal window is supposedly identified by an enhancement of the ratio @xmath14 with respect to a qcd - like theory  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this quantity does not display a simple known parametric behaviour .",
    "another strategy , which is adopted in this paper , is to first identify theories within the conformal window , and then approach the boundary of the window using the available information on the color - flavor phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the identification of conformal theories using numerical simulations is a difficult task , since the only observable quantities would be the power - law scaling of correlators at large distances .",
    "however actual lattice simulations are performed in a finite volume , and with a non - vanishing fermion mass ; both the mass and the finite size of the system are relevant operators at large distances and drive the theory away from conformal behaviour . turning a technical limitation into a tool ,",
    "it has become a standard strategy to consider conformal gauge theories ( cgt ) candidates deformed by a mass term , and to identify them from the study of their hadronic observables .",
    "thus , if there exists an irfp , the lattice results should be described by a mass - deformed conformal gauge theory ( mcgt ) , obtained by adding a bare mass to the original lagrangian @xmath15 as a consequence of the deformation , these theories are expected to develop a mass gap and a fermion condensate and thus give rise to asymptotic states and related observables , which scale to zero as the massless limit is approached . for any observable @xmath16 the leading exponent @xmath17 of the mass deformation",
    "is defined from its scaling as @xmath18 : @xmath19 these critical exponents can be measured on the lattice and it is the aim of this work to provide predictions for them that can be tested numerically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : cw ]",
    "we set the framework by discussing some characteristics of theories inside the conformal window . in section  [ sec : irfp ] we discuss general aspects of irfps , and introduce the standard tools for analyzing the behaviour of field correlators near a fixed point of the rg flow .",
    "thereby we obtain the hyperscaling relations that are usually derived in the context of critical phenomena @xcite , and we study the information that they yield in the framework of mcgt .",
    "section  [ sec : bcs ] is devoted to the study of the chiral condensate in mcgts .",
    "first we review the relation between the scaling of the chiral condensate with the fermion mass , and the density of eigenvalues of the massless dirac operator in the infinite  volume limit .",
    "as stated above , the chiral condensate must vanish as the fermion mass is taken to zero at a rate that is dictated by a critical exponent @xmath20 .",
    "the non - analytic dependence of the fermion condensate on the fermion mass is directly related to the scaling exponent for the eigenvalue density of the massless dirac operator . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the exponents turn out to be the same : @xmath21 the scaling exponent @xmath22 is determined as a function of @xmath5 , the anomalous dimension of the mass at the irfp .",
    "the rg analysis , which applies to all condensates , yields @xmath23 we then present the determination of this coefficient from a heuristic calculation , which provides some physical insight in the dynamics of mcgt .",
    "the limitations of such a heuristic approach are highlighted , and the interpretation of ir and uv cutoffs is clarified .",
    "we conclude this section by analyzing current lattice data for the eigenvalue distribution in an su(2 ) gauge theory with two flavours in the adjoint representation .    in section  [ sec : fps ]",
    "we explore the consequences of hyperscaling for the decay constants of the hadronic states .",
    "our results , summarized in tab .  [ tab : tab_decay ] , can schematically written as , @xmath24 for operators with scaling dimension @xmath25 .",
    "further informations are obtained by combining these results with the chiral ward identities in section  [ sec : wi ] ; these scaling predictions for the decay constants are then compared with recent results from numerical simulations of potential mcgt on the lattice .",
    "finally we discuss the implication of the scaling of the decay constants for the width of the hadronic states , and compare the scaling of the decay constants in a mcgt to the one of heavy quarkonia states in a chirally broken theory like qcd .",
    "it is well known that @xmath26 gauge theories with @xmath27 fermions are asymptotically free as long as @xmath27 does not exceed an upper limit that depends on the number of colours @xmath28 and the fermion representation @xmath29 . at small distances",
    "the gauge coupling decreases logarithmically , and the dynamics is successfully described by perturbation theory . in the @xmath30 gauge theory minimally coupled to @xmath31 light flavors in the fundamental representation , the coupling increases at large distances , and the theory undergoes confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , exhibiting a spectrum of bound states . in the massless limit ,",
    "the spectrum includes three massless goldstone bosons , known as ( @xmath32 ) , reflecting the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry . as a consequence",

    "a small non - vanishing mass can easily be incorporated as a perturbation of the massless theory .",
    "as the number of light fermions is increased , before asymptotic freedom is lost , the theory may develop an infrared fixed point ( irfp ) due to the effect of the fermions on the running of the coupling .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath35 the number of fermions above which the theory exhibits an irfp . in this case",

    "dyson equations  @xcite ; these analyses were extended to higher representations in ref .",
    "unfortunately it is very difficult to control the systematic errors due to the truncation of the 1pi vertices appearing in the schwinger  dyson equations .",
    "moreover schwinger ",
    "dyson equations predict the anomalous dimension of the mass to be around one , whereas unitarity constraints on the conformal group  @xcite , in principle , allow for @xmath37 .",

    "we defer the investigation of the connections between our results and these other approaches for further studies .",
    "recent numerical simulations of gauge theories on the lattice have triggered a renewed interest in those theories and in turn in technicolor models .",
    "algorithmic progresses have made lattice simulations with light dynamical fermions accessible on current hardware  @xcite .",
    "this opens the possibility to obtain first principles results for technicolor , and several preliminary investigations have appeared  @xcite .",
    "it is important to bare in mind that recent lattice results for theories that may lie inside the conformal window are plagued by systematic errors , and their interpretation still needs to be clarified .",
    "a recent discussion of the lattice artefacts in simulations of theories with a potential irfp can be found in refs .  @xcite . for these theories , unlike in qcd , there are no experimental results to guide the lattice simulations .    therefore it is crucial to develop analytical results in order to guide the lattice studies , and help in analyzing their outcome . a wider range of analytical predictions , together with more extensive simulations , will help in finding robust evidence for the existence of irfps .",
    "let us henceforth consider theories _ inside _ the conformal window , _ i.e. _ gauge theories minimally coupled to a number @xmath27 of dirac fermions , with the number of flavors and their representation adjusted so that the theories are scale - invariant at large distances when the fermions are massless . in general ,",

    "this scaling is consistent e.g. with the scenarios proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the derivation",
    "above we have not considered the effects of a finite decay width . at least one channel ought to be stable and therefore not affected by the width . according to an inequality by weingarten  @xcite , valid for @xmath74",

    "we would like to bring forward two reasons why this should not be the case .",
    "first the difference in the large @xmath28-scaling of mass and width ( @xmath76 ) from qcd should hold in mcgt too and serve as a parametric argument against such a cancellation .",
    "second we show in appendix  [ app : width ] that in the approximation where the self - energy is treated as being constant such a cancellation can be excluded .",
    "this seems intuitively plausible since in euclidian time the mass and decay width behaviour are associated with exponential and oscillatory behaviour respectively .    on the contrary since mass and width",
    "do not seem to interfere in the leading large @xmath55-behaviour eq .",
    "suggests that both the mass and the width of the resonance scale according to @xmath77 we shall revisit the scaling of the width in sect .  [ sec : fps ] , after discussing the scaling of the decay constants and derive @xmath78 for a specific decay @xmath79 .",
    "the behaviour is markedly different from what is observed in the spectrum of theories where chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , like _",
    "e.g. _  in qcd . in the latter theories , the goldstone bosons become massless in the chiral limit , while the other states remain massive , with their masses being of the order of some typical hadronic scale @xmath34 . for theories with an irfp ,",
    "all states become massless , presumably at the same rate , which prevents a simple description of the nonperturbative low energy hadronic dynamics in terms of an effective theory like chiral perturbation theory .",
    "let us conclude this section by recalling how the finite - size effects can be analyzed using rg equations .",
    "we shall discuss explicitly the case of the correlator @xmath80 , including the dependence on the size of the system @xmath81 .",
    "we remind the reader that by studying finite volume effects , it is implied that the box is larger than the typical scale , @xmath82 , and therefore does not interfere with characteristic short distance dynamics .",
