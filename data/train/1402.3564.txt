    "the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model on a square lattice has attracted a lot of attention due to its close relation to the disappearance of the af order in high - t@xmath4 superconducting material  @xcite and its possibility of realizing the so called spin liquid state  @xcite .",
    "the spin liquids , defined as lacking long range order and supporting strong quantum fluctuation , have all the key properties of the insulating state `` nearby '' to a superconducting phase .",
    "hence a simple example of spin liquids , the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state was proposed to describe high - t@xmath4 superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "spin liquids have become the focus of research in modern condensed matter physics since the discovery of different kinds of spin liquids in theory  @xcite .",
    "although the existence and stability of spin liquids in realistic models and real material are still in question  @xcite .    the nature of the ground state of the @xmath0 af heisenberg model in the intermediate coupling region has been debated  @xcite for decades due to the highly frustrated nature of this model and is still a open question .",
    "recently , several numerical works revisited this model using novel concept , such as the topological entanglement entropy ( tee )  @xcite , and new numerical tools , such as the projected entangled pair states ( pepss )  @xcite .",
    "amazingly many of them have reached a consistent and the lowest ground state energy ever  @xcite , however their resulting ground states behave diversely .",
    "a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) study on long cylinders suggested a gaped @xmath5 spin liquids from the evidences of non - vanishing singlet and triplet gaps in the paramagnetic phase and a nonzero tee  @xcite .",
    "the gutzwiller - projected bcs wavefunction study indicated a gapless spin liquid state supported by the existence of gapless triplet excitations at momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the dmrg study with @xmath8 symmetry imposed on the states on long cylinders found a diverging dimer correlation length , and claimed a plaquette valence bond solid ( vbs ) state as the ground state  @xcite .",
    "these controversial results pose the question about the numerical convergence and the system size dependence  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a novel wavefunction and use the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method to tackle this system .",
    "as one knows , the key to a meaningful variational method is to have a good trial wavefunction . here , we take a resonating valence bond state approach .",
    "the reasons for such a choice are the following , first of all , rvb states can describe a variety of phases including the spin liquids , the af long range ordered states and the valence bond solids  @xcite ; second of all , recent development in pepss showed that a family of one parameter pepss with bond dimension @xmath9 , which described the rvb state beyond the nearest neighbor pairing , can greatly lower the variational energy of this model compared to that of the short range rvb state  @xcite .",
    "we can imagine that with more build - in correlations and hence more variational parameters , the rvb states should approach the true ground state very well .",
    "the simplest rvb ansatz on a bipartite lattice is the valence bond amplitude product ( ap ) state , where the probability of having a valence bond of separation @xmath10 is independent of each other and is denoted as @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "consequently the bond amplitudes @xmath11 become the variational parameters for the valence bond ap states .",
    "simulations based on this variational ansatz has been done  @xcite : it was found that the amplitude @xmath12 tends to be negative for @xmath13 in order to minimize the energy within this variational subspace .",
    "the place where @xmath12 changes sign signals the break down of the marshall s sign rule  @xcite and is very close to the proposed critical point where the af long range order disappears .",
    "it is interesting to ask the question that does the onset of the negative amplitude in the valence bond ap state indicate a phase transition to new states ? in this paper , we will give our answer to this question from the correlated valence bond point of view .",
    "prior to our investigation , lin et al . introduced the so called correlated amplitude product ( cap ) state , where an extra weight factor has been given to a pair of valence bonds  @xcite in order to build the bond - bond correlations into the wavefunction , however they have not yet applied the caps to the @xmath0 af heienberg model .",
    "the goal of this paper is to simulate the ground state of the @xmath0 af heisenberg model on square lattice using the correlated valence bond states , whose definition will be clear in sec  [ wf ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as following : in sec .",
    "[ wf ] , we define the correlated valence bond states , which have some similarity but are essentially different from the caps  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the variational monte carlo method and the optimization strategy for this wavefunction in sec .",
    "[ methods ] . upon optimization of the correlated valence bond states by minimizing the ground state energies , we arrive at the optimal states . in sec .  [ results ]",
    ", we present the variational ground state energy and the ground state correlations for the optimized states . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the advantages and limitation of this ansatz and conclude for the nature of the intermediate phase of the @xmath0 af heisenberg model on square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 af heisenberg model on a square lattice is given by @xmath14 where the first summation runs over the nn pair @xmath15 and the second summation runs over the next nn ( nnn ) pair @xmath16 .",
    "an equal weight superposition of the short range rvb state has been applied as a trial wavefunction to the ground state of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ afheisenberg ] )  @xcite , but the variational energy is not good and it is nowhere close to the true ground state at any coupling ratio @xmath17 .",
    "one step forward was made by introducing a positive amplitude to an arbitrary ranged bipartite valence bond in the frame work of the valence bond ap states  @xcite ; the reported best thermodynamic energy at @xmath18 is @xmath19 per site , which is still much higher than the dmrg studies  @xcite and has left a lot of room for improvement in the trial wavefunction . here",
    "we speculate that the bond - bond correlations may play a crucial role than the individual long range bonds  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we define a class of ansatze called the correlated valence bond states by a set of statistical rules :    1 .   considering without the presence of the correlated valence bond pairs ,",
    "the ansatz is reduced to a short - bond amplitude product state : the bond amplitude @xmath20 and otherwise 0 . 2 .",
    "if two short individual bonds are sitting next to a common edge of the lattice , they are allowed to quantum fluctuate to any other valence bond tilings on these four sites , and _ vice versa _ , as illustrated in fig .",
    "each valence bond tiling of these four sites is associated with a amplitude marked as either 1 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) are the variational parameters .",
    "the two short bonds on the left hand side of the reversible - arrow in fig .  [ cap ] are two individual bonds ( uncorrelated ) , which can be randomly rearranged with all other uncorrelated short bonds into any allowed short bond product state .",
    "however the two correlated bonds together with the lattice edge ( in blue dash line ) on the right hand side of the reversible - arrow form a single object such that the two bonds there in can not be treated independently .",
    "the correlated - bond - pair can only be flipped back to the two short bonds exactly shown on the left hand side of the reversible - arrow .",
    "the above three rules together form a statistical mechanic ensemble . before discussing the variational monte carlo algorithm ,",
    "several comments are along the line .",
    "we choose such a statistical ensemble as the trial wavefunction in order to address bond - bond correlations .",
    "the amplitudes of the correlated - bond - pairs give extra factors to the wavefunction coefficients , and this ansatz goes beyond the ap state .",
    "the correlated - bond - pair amplitudes serve as the variational parameters of the trial wavefunction .",
    "we can easily translate this ansatz to a peps wavefunction that describes qualitatively the same statistical ensemble .",
    "we impose the translational and rotational symmetries to the wavefunction to reduce the number of variational parameters .",
    "this restriction is perfectly valid as long as we work with finite size systems .",
    "there are four distinct arrangements of two short bonds that are connected by a common lattice edge , as illuminated in fig .",
    "[ cap ] , therefore eight different correlated - bond - pairs whose amplitudes are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter , we use the word `` correlated - bond - pair '' and its amplitude interchangeably . given these clarifications ,",
    "we can write the trial wavefunction as following @xmath27 is a compact pack of individual short bonds and correlated - bond - pairs on a lattice which produce a valence bond tiling configuration @xmath28 , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the number of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) in a compact pack @xmath31 .",
    "note that different packing @xmath31 can generate the same valence bond tiling configuration @xmath28 .    .",
    "the arrows marked for @xmath28 ( in black lines ) align with the sign convention , whereas for @xmath32 ( in gray lines ) anti - align with the sign convention .",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of arrows that violate the direction of the flow and @xmath35 is the number of loops in the transition graph .",
    "in this section , we first briefly describe the variational valence bond monte carlo method , followed by the optimization method used to determine the optimal variational parameters .    given a variational wavefunction @xmath36 ,",
    "the expectation value of any operator @xmath37 is written as @xmath38 with the importance sampling weight defined as @xmath39 and the operator matrix element defined as @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the overlap matrix element . if both the coefficients @xmath42 and the overlap matrix elements @xmath43 are positive definite , we could use the standard valence bond mc method  @xcite",
    ". however our valence bond configuration @xmath28 allows valence bonds of the same sublattice pairing , therefore the overlap matrix elements can be negative ; in addition , the correlated - bond - pair amplitudes can take negative values , which means the coefficients @xmath42 can be negative too .",
    "thus our wavefunction encounters a negative sign problem .",
    "we can treat it in a standard way by rewriting eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) as @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the sign of the weight eq .",
    "( [ wt ] ) .",
    "we sample using the absolute value @xmath46 ( abbreviated as @xmath47 ) as the importance weight .",
    "the operator expectation value can be obtained by taking the ratio of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we now explain how to calculate the overlap matrix element @xmath43 and how to count the sign in @xmath45 .",
    "we fix the sign convention for any valence bond in @xmath28 : for the ab sublattice pairing , the direction of the valence bond is always pointing from the a sublattice to the b sublattice ; whereas for the same sublattice pairing , we refer to the signs drawn in fig .",
    "[ sign](a ) as the convention . given @xmath28 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the overlap matrix element for a transition graph is @xmath50 , where @xmath35 is the number of loops in the transition graph and @xmath34 is the number of singlets that violate the direction of flow that is arbitrarily chosen for each loop in the transition graph .",
    "an example of the transition graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ sign](b ) . here",
    "@xmath51 is a normalization constant , since the maximum number of loops in a transition graph is @xmath52 .",
    "the total number of minus sign factors in the coefficient @xmath42 depends on the sign convention and the signs of the variational parameters @xmath23 .",
    "putting all signs together we have @xmath53 .",
    "next , we explain how to calculate the operator matrix element @xmath54 .",
    "since the singlet product states @xmath55 appear on both the numerator and the denominator , we can choose any singlet sign convention we want ( those sign factors will cancel if otherwise choose a difference sign convention ) .",
    "for any transition graph , we choose one such that every loop has @xmath56 structure , _",
    "i.e. _ we choose the sign to be always pointing from @xmath57 to @xmath58 . here",
    "we use @xmath59 to differentiate the @xmath60 sublattices of the original lattice bipartition , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 only have a relative meaning within each loop . therefore all operator expectation values can be evaluated using the same formulas as in the ref .",

    "( [ crvb ] ) takes two types of update .",
    "the first type of update is the local update .",
    "we begin by randomly selecting a link from the lattice , one of the following cases will happen :    1 .",
    "if the link is not occupied by any singlets and it sits beside two individual short bonds , propose to flip randomly to one of the correlated - bond - pairs or stay unchanged with the corresponding probability ; 2 .",
    "if the link belongs to a correlated - bond - pair and is exactly sitting on the reference edge in blue dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ cap ] , propose to flip to the two individual short bonds or stay unchanged with the corresponding probability ; 3 .",
    "for any other cases , abandon such a choice and iterate .",
    "if a local update is proposed , we accept or reject this local update with probability @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 is the number of loop in the trial transition graph .",
    "the second type of update is the loop update .",
    "we randomly construct an allowed loop of alternating individual short bonds and vacant lattice links , then we shift all individual short bonds on that loop by one lattice space . this rearrangement can always be proposed with probability 1 , since all individual short bond have equal amplitudes , and it will keep all the correlated - bond - pairs untouched . the loop update is accepted or rejected with probability @xmath63 $ ] defined above .",
    "we use variational mc to calculate the derivative of the energy with respect to a variational parameter @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) as @xmath67 and update them according to  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the iteration index , @xmath70 is a random number @xmath71 , and @xmath72 until the energy converges . the function form @xmath73",
    "is chosen heuristically  @xcite .",
    "the optimization results and correlation functions will be presented in the next section .",

    "we present the well optimized variational parameters for the wavefunction eq .",
    "( [ crvb ] ) for system sizes @xmath2 at @xmath76 $ ] in fig .  [ para ] .",
    "we find strong size dependence for the optimized variational parameters @xmath77 .",
    "however , parameters @xmath78 have less size dependence",
    ". other parameters that are not shown in fig .",
    "[ para ] are optimized close to zero .",
    "the absolute energy error per site @xmath79 for sizes @xmath80 compared with the exact diagonalization ( ed ) results  @xcite and for size @xmath3 compared with the dmrg results  @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "the absolute errors are small , _ e.g. _ , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . for comparison ,",
    "we draw the gutzwiller - projected bcs wavefunction results without lanczos projection  @xcite in the same frame : at @xmath83 , our absolute energy error is lower by about @xmath84 .",
    "we take the optimized parameters from size @xmath3 to calculate the order parameters and the correlation functions for system sizes @xmath85 until the average signs are no longer manageable , because optimizing variational parameters for @xmath85 becomes not feasible .",
    "we assume that the correlation functions at larger sizes will not be too sensitive to the variational parameters as long as they are within a reasonable range from the optimal values .     in a log - log plot . power law functions @xmath86",
    ", @xmath87 have been fitted to the points for @xmath88 . ]",
    "let us first define a set of order parameters .",
    "the sublattice magnetization is written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the spin correlation function , and it is defined as @xmath92 the dimer order parameter is defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .    the sublattice magnetization and the dimer order parameter are presented in log - log plots in fig .",

    "the dimer order parameter follows a power law decay with system size as @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , we find a critical phase that has gapless singlet excitations and gaped triplet excitations within the range of @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "we next make some connections to the results given by previous work .",
    "a large optimal parameter @xmath101 is consistent with the results of an enhanced spin - spin correlation along the @xmath102 and @xmath103 axes shown in ref .",
    "a negative optimal parameter @xmath104 is consistent with the result of having negative @xmath12 in the simulation using an ap product state  @xcite .",
    "our variational term @xmath105 generates configuration of parallel diagonal bond pair .",

    "our optimized wavefunction , which contains both the parallel diagonal bonds and the short bonds , does not behave like a @xmath5 spin liquid , although it deviates from the special point of equal weights superposition defined in ref .",
    "we need to do further investigation to answer why it fails to be a @xmath5 spin liquid .",
    "the optimal parameter @xmath106 at system size @xmath3 grows rapidly as a function of @xmath107 , whose effect is to increase the dimer - dimer correlation .",
    "however given this optimized parameter strength , the effect of @xmath106 will not induce a quantum phase transition from a critical phase to the vbs phase as predicted in ref  @xcite , because the latter phase requires a very large value in @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "let us turn to the question that we asked earlier : does a negative amplitude @xmath108 in an ap state indicate a phase transition ?",
    "from our example , the answer seems to be no .",
    "the critical phase presented in our work is simply a result of muting all the long range bonds in the ap state , as one increase the weights of @xmath104 and @xmath105 from 0 , there are no signs of a phase transition from the critical phase to either @xmath5 or vbs states . therefore we conclude that the negative amplitude @xmath108 along in an ap state could not trigger a phase transition .",
    "using the correlated valence bond state , we minimized the ground state energy of the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model on a square lattice for a coupling ratio @xmath1 $ ] by turning a few correlated - bond - pair amplitudes .",
    "the energies are consistent with the exact diagonalization ( ed ) results on the @xmath109 and @xmath74 tori  @xcite and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) results on the @xmath75 torus  @xcite .",
    "we applied the optimal variational parameters from the @xmath75 system to the larger tori and studied their correlation functions using the valence bond monte carlo ( mc ) sampling method .",
    "we found that within the optimized phase , the neel order parameter scales as the inverse of the volume , and the dimer order parameter describing the columnar or plaquette valence bond solid ( vbs ) phases follows a power law decay with the system size @xmath110 approximately as @xmath111 .",
    "these correlation functions indicate a critical phase with gapless singlet excitations and gaped triplet excitations in the entire range of @xmath1 $ ] . due to the negative sign problem",
    ", we can not optimize even larger systems or further increase the number of variational parameters , such as turn on the individual long range bonds .",
    "our simulation provide insights of how and when the critical phase can turn into a vbs or a @xmath5 spin liquid .",
