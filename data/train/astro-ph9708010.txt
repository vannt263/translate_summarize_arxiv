    "spallation reactions involving protons or alpha particles colliding with the nuclei of the abundant light elements carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen have long been recognized as important or dominant contributors to the production of the isotopes of lithium , beryllium , and boron ( reeves , fowler & hoyle 1970 ) .",
    "evidence for this picture includes the fact that the ratios of abundances of spallation products are equal to the ratios of the production cross sections , the large overabundance of spallation products in cosmic rays , and the fact that the observed cosmic ray flux irradiating a poulation i composition for the age of the galaxy produces the observed spallation to cno abundance ratio . for a summary of these arguments",
    "see the review by reeves ( 1982 ) .",
    "spallation nucleosynthesis in the interstellar medium of a well mixed galaxy is very inefficient if the metallicity of the gas is low . in the simplest closed box model of galactic chemical evolution ,",
    "the abundance of spallation products is proportional to the square of the iron abundance at low metallicity .",
    "this prediction is contradicted by the observations of beryllium and boron abundances in low metallicity stars ( duncan @xmath2 @xmath3 1992 , gilmore @xmath2 @xmath3 1992 , boesgaard 1996 ) which show that the be / fe and b / fe ratios are independent of metallicity and approximately equal to their solar values for stars in the metallicity range -1@xmath4[fe / h]@xmath4 - 3 .    to account for these observations",
    "we propose that spallation nucleosynthesis took place in the supernova event itself . in our model ,",
    "particles are accelerated and irradiate the cno nuclei in the supernova ejecta long before the ejecta mixes with the interstellar medium of the early galaxy .",
    "we follow the propagation of the accelerated particles with a monte - carlo analysis and find that reproducing the observed spallation to iron ratio requires about @xmath0 ergs to go into accelerating particles .",
    "we also find , not surprisingly , that we produce the same isotopic ratios as are found in calculations which irradiate a solar composition interstellar medium .",
    "[ table1 ]       the simulation is run for various accelerated particle spectra and compositions of irradiated material .",
    "the compositions of 15m@xmath9 , 25m@xmath9 and 35m@xmath9 supernova ejecta ( weaver & woosley 1993 ) are used as irradiated material distributed uniformly in a sphere of radius of 10@xmath10 cm .",
    "the source spectrum of accelerated particles is described as constant ( flat spectrum ) up to a certain cutoff energy @xmath6 and at energies @xmath11 , a power law decrease by index @xmath7 .",
    "we use various cutoff energies ( @xmath6 = 50 mev-500 mev / nucleon ) and power law indices ( @xmath7 = 2 - 10 ) and compare the results .",
    "we calculate the total number of light element isotopes ( @xmath12li , @xmath13li , @xmath14be , @xmath15b , @xmath16b ) produced by spallation in the irradiated ejecta , the total number of elastic and inelastic collisions and the energy needed per spallation @xmath17 .",
    "we find the energy per spallation ( @xmath5 ) to be in the range of 1 - 10 gev , as shown in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is higher in the case of @xmath6 = 500 mev / nucleon because the number of inelastic collisions is dramatically increased as the accelerated particle spectrum extends well beyond the 280 mev threshold for inelastic collisions .    using the solar abundances ( cameron 1982 ) , corrected for @xmath13li to account for its production in the big bang nucleosynthesis",
    ", we get the total number of spallations per @xmath18fe nucleus as 2.6 @xmath19 10@xmath20 the total amount of @xmath18fe ejected from a supernova is taken as 0.07m@xmath9 , as observed in sn1987a ( erickson @xmath2 @xmath3 1988 ) . therefore the total number of spallations per supernova required for light element production is @xmath21 . using 5 gev as the value of energy per spallation , we get the total energy required as 3 @xmath19 10@xmath22 ergs . a typical supernova releases about 10@xmath23 ergs ,",
    "so only a small fraction of the total energy needs to be directed towards spallation reactions .    the variation of b / be and @xmath16b/@xmath15b ratios with cutoff energy @xmath6 and power law index @xmath7 are shown in fig .",
    "the isotopic ratios @xmath16b/@xmath15b , @xmath12li/@xmath14be , @xmath13li/@xmath12li and b / be , the number of @xmath24s produced as a result of p - p inelastic collision and the energy required per spallation ( @xmath5 ) , calculated for supernova masses of 15m@xmath8 , 25m@xmath8 and 35m@xmath8 with accelerated particle spectrum as @xmath6 = 100mev / nucleon , index @xmath7 = 5 are shown in table 2 .",
    "the observed isotopic ratios are also shown for comparison .",
    "the b / be ratio is recently observed in several halo dwarfs ( duncan @xmath2 @xmath3 1992 , boesgaard 1996 ) and is found to be in the vicinity of 10 , which is consistent with our calculations .",
    "the solar @xmath16b/@xmath15b ratio of 4 is higher than our calculated value of 2.5 .",
    "there may be other sources of @xmath16b production , such as neutrino induced nucleosynthesis in a type ii supernova ( woosley @xmath2 @xmath3 1990 ) , giving us the high @xmath16b/@xmath15b ratio .",
    "the energy required per spallation decreases with increasing supernova mass because the h / cno ratio decreases with increasing supernova mass and so there are more spallation collisions and fewer elastic / inelastic collisions , thus utilizing more of the energy for spallation .",
    "for the same reason the number of @xmath24s produced decreases with increasing supernova mass .",
    "table 3 shows the number of @xmath24s produced for various cutoff energies @xmath6 and index @xmath7 , calculated for a 25m@xmath8 supernova composition .",
    "the threshold for @xmath24 production is at 280 mev , so for certain accelerated particle spectra we get no pion production .",
    "the @xmath24s subsequently decay producing two @xmath25 rays at energies centered around 70 mev .",
