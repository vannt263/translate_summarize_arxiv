    "late b - type stars with hgmn peculiarity are characterized by low rotational velocities and weak or non - detectable magnetic fields .",
    "the most distinctive features of their atmospheres are the extreme overabundance of hg and mn .",
    "more than 2/3 of hgmn stars belong to spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the presence of an inhomogeneous distribution of some elements over the surface of hgmn stars was discussed for the first time by @xcite .",
    "the first definitively identified spectrum variability has been reported for the binary star @xmath0 and by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we present the first results of our preliminary doppler imaging ( di ) modeling of abundance distributions for four elements on the surface of the hgmn star ar  aur ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the analysis of the spectra is made with the di inversion code iabu , which reconstructs the stellar surface abundance inhomogeneities from the series of spectral line profiles using the tikhonov regularization algorithm .",
    "previously @xcite concluded that the employment of a partially fractured equatorial ring presents a realistic distribution of y on the stellar surface .",
    "our new map based on the inversion of the y  ii @xmath14900 line is in good agreement with this conclusion .",
    "the y is overabundant and strongly concentrated in the equatorial ring , where the average y abundance reaches log@xmath2(y ) = 6.0 ( in the scale log@xmath2(h ) = 12.0 ) .",
    "one large fraction of the ring is missing exactly on the surface area which is permanently facing the secondary . an additional polar detail can be seen at longitudes 180@xmath3270@xmath3 .",
    "the surface distribution of strontium was studied with the ion line sr  ii @xmath14215 .",
    "the sr surface distribution in ar  aur is not completely similar to the map reconstructed for y  ii , although it also presents significant equatorial details of sr overabundance in the range of longitudes from 70@xmath3 to 250@xmath3 .    in the case of the hg  ii @xmath13984 line we normalized our spectra",
    "relative to the pseudo - continuum of the h@xmath2 wing , but accounted for blending by the hydrogen line in the calculations of the synthetic spectra by adding corresponding opacity sources .",
    "the line list used for the di consists of isotopic and hyperfine structure components of the hg  ii @xmath13984 line and a y  ii @xmath13982.59 blending line .",
    "we parameterized the mercury isotope composition using the isotopic - fractionation model of @xcite .",
    "our observational data are insufficient for a simultaneous determination of both the hg abundance and the surface distribution of the q - parameter , hence we accept q=0 for the terrestrial mixture .",
    "the mercury overabundance is strongly concentrated in several equatorial details on the surface of the star .",
    "further we find polar appendages at longitudes 0@xmath390@xmath3    for the first time we reconstructed in a hgmn star the manganese distribution on the stellar surface .",
    "the mn ion map is based on modeling of the mn  ii @xmath14292 line .",
    "this map is not presented in fig .  1 due to lack of space .",
    "we demonstrated that the mn surface distribution shows similarities with those of y and sr , namely both equatorial and polar features .",
    "what is the explanation for the discovered inhomogeneities ? taking into account",
    "that more than 2/3 of the hgmn stars are known to belong to spectroscopic binaries , a scenario how a magnetic field can be built up in binary systems has been presented some time ago by @xcite who suggested that a tidal torque varying with depth and latitude in a star induces differential rotation .",
    "differential rotation in a radiative star can , however , be prone to the magneto - rotational instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "magnetohydrodynamical simulations revealed a distinct structure for the magnetic field topology similar to the latitudinal fractured rings observed on the surface of @xmath0  and and ar  aur ."
