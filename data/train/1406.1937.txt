    "lattice models which are endowed with conservative stochastic dynamics are known as lattice gases .",
    "lattice gases were originally introduced , using the language of spin - exchange dynamics , by kawasaki @xcite , and they have played a crucial role in the following development of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . one does not need to go to high dimensions to observe interesting behaviors in lattice gases  dynamics and non - equilibrium steady states are surprisingly rich already in one - dimensional lattice gases .",
    "the simple exclusion process ( sep ) is perhaps the most well - known and widely studied interacting lattice gas . in the sep , each site is either occupied by a particle or empty , and particles undergo nearest - neighbor hopping ; only hops to empty sites are allowed and therefore particles interact only through the exclusion property .",
    "two most popular versions , the symmetric simple exclusion process ( ssep ) when hopping is symmetric and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) when hopping is only in one direction , have been thoroughly investigated ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest one - dimensional setting is a ring .",
    "one is usually interested in the thermodynamic limit when the number of sites @xmath1 and the number of particles @xmath2 diverge while the density remains fixed : @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 being fixed .",
    "the steady states of the sep are thus fully characterized by the density : @xmath6 .",
    "numerous generalizations of the sep , partly inspired by applications to protein synthesis @xcite and to vehicular traffic @xcite , have been investigated .",
    "these models often involve a facilitation mechanism ",
    "the hopping rate depends on more than just the occupancy of the neighboring site  @xcite . in glassy dynamics , for instance",
    ", the particle mobility decreases as the local density increases  @xcite ; the opposite occurs for molecular motors where a moving particle exerts a hydrodynamic force pushing other particles  @xcite .    in extensions of the sep , the hopping event is determined by the local environment of the hopping particle , e.g. , it may depend on occupancies of sites on distance @xmath7 from the hopping particle @xcite , where @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "another feature which is always obeyed is that every hopping event involves a single particle .",
    "lattice gases violating this second property have been recently investigated @xcite . in the accelerated exclusion process @xcite , for instance",
    ", the initial hop can trigger at most one more hop : as in the sep , particles undergo nearest - neighbor hopping , and if a particle hops to a vacant site and joins an island of length @xmath9 , the front particle from that island also hops .",
    "( an island is a string of occupied sites delimited by vacant sites on both ends . ) at most one additional hop is allowed to occur , that is , the second particle can not trigger another hop .",
    "when @xmath10 , the accelerated exclusion process reduces to the sep .    here",
    "we consider the model with no restrictions on island length and avalanche size .",
    "thus if a hopping particle joins an island of arbitrary length , the front particle from this island hops in the same direction , and this second hopping can trigger the third , which can in turn trigger the fourth , etc .",
    "ad infinitum .",
    "we shall call this model an exclusion process with avalanches ( epa ) .",
    "one can consider a two - parameter family of models with thresholds both on the island size and on the duration of avalanches : an induced hop occurs only after a particle joins an island of length @xmath7 and the number of induced hops is @xmath11 . in the epa , whenever a particle joins an island it always triggers the front particle of that island to hop , and an avalanche can be arbitrarily long .",
    "thus @xmath12 for the epa .",
    "only the extreme versions appear solvable , namely the epa ( as we will demonstrate in this article ) and of course the sep ( for which @xmath13 or equivalently @xmath10 ) .    in the next section , we classify the steady states , compute the current for the totally asymmetric epa , and determine various correlation functions . in sec .",
    "[ asym_epa : sec ] we examine various hydrodynamic solutions , particularly rarefaction and shock waves , arising in the realm of the totally asymmetric epa . in sec .",
    "[ sym_epa : sec ] we consider the symmetric epa , compute the density - dependent diffusion coefficient , study the amplitude of self - diffusion , and compare simulation results with theoretical predictions for these transport coefficients .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ concl : sec ] .",
    "in this section we consider the epa on the ring . the difference in hopping rules of sep and epa",
    "is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : hopping ] .",
    "the initial configuration is shown on the top .",
    "we consider the hopping event which starts when the left - most particle ( empty circle ) makes the hop to the empty site on the right .",
    "this completes the hopping event in the case of sep ( second row ) . for the epa ( third column ) ,",
    "the primary hop triggers the second hop , the second hop triggers the third , which then trigers the fourth , and only then the hopping event is completed as the last hopping particle has not joined an island .        for the epa on a finite ring , the memory of the initial condition will be eventually forgotten .",
    "we want to understand the nature of the steady states , to determine the current ( if the hopping is biased ) , and to compute density correlations .",
    "the high - density regime @xmath14 is pathological as a never - ending avalanche will eventually occur .",
    "( for instance , after a few hopping events , the initial configuration shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : hopping ] enters in an infinite avalanche . )",
    "therefore we tacitly assume that @xmath15 if not stated otherwise .",
    "the steady states admit a neat classification : they are configurations with the maximal number of islands .",
    "since @xmath15 , the maximal island configurations are such where all islands have length one . therefore after a transient period , the epa reaches a configuration like @xmath16 and it will then forever wander on the phase space of such maximal - island configurations . in and other illustrations",
    "@xmath17 denotes a particle and @xmath18 denotes a vacancy .",
    "thus in we have illustrated a steady state on a ring of length @xmath19 that contains @xmath20 particles and @xmath21 vacancies .",
    "the emergence of the maximal - island configurations is easy to appreciate : after each completed hopping event , the total number of islands increases or remains the same , and in the low - density regime it eventually becomes maximal and then it stays maximal forever .",
    "the space of maximal - island configurations is connected : each maximal - island configuration can evolve into a configuration containing the longest possible string of alternating particles and vacancies complemented by the string of vacancies .",
    "it turns out that all maximal - island configurations are equally probable .",
    "this remarkable property is generally valid for epa irrespectively is there a bias or not .",
    "the totally asymmetric version ( say particles hop only to the right ) is slightly simpler as it has twice less possible hops than the general epa , so let s focus on it and derive that maximal - island configurations are equally probable for the totally asymmetric epa . apart from expressions for the current [ eqs .   below ] , the results of this section apply to any epa .",
    "let @xmath22 be the probability that the system is in maximal - island configuration @xmath23 . in the steady state @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the transition rate from @xmath23 to @xmath26 .",
    "this rate obeys the zero - one law : @xmath27",
    "if the evolution is allowed and @xmath28 otherwise . therefore , we merely need to count the number of ways into and out of a configuration .",
    "each particle can hop in the maximal - island configuration , so @xmath29 . to count the number of maximal - island configurations @xmath30",
    "that can change into @xmath23 , we use a simple trick : we reverse the direction of hopping and notice that for each @xmath31 with our original hopping to the right we can find a unique inverse process @xmath32 with hopping to the left . for the latter ,",
    "the number of ways out is equal to @xmath2",
    ". it must be the same for the former : @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath22 are equal for all configurations , eq .   is clearly satisfied .",
    "the probability of a maximum - island configuration is therefore equal to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total number of such configurations with @xmath2 particles and @xmath36 vacancies that can be arranged on a ring of size @xmath37 .",
    "the total number of maximum - island configurations is @xmath38 see @xcite for a computation of a similar quantity .      in a maximum - island configuration ,",
    "avalanches are triggered by strings of alternating particles and vacancies .",
    "for instance , the snapshot @xmath39 represents an alternating string with 4 particles ; the illustration contains the @xmath40particle string together with the @xmath41particle string and the @xmath42particle string .",
    "generally , let @xmath43 be the density of @xmath44particle strings . to determine @xmath43 we need to compute the number of configurations where @xmath45 remaining particles",
    "are inserted into @xmath46 possible positions ( denoted by @xmath47 ) @xmath48 the example is meant to be general , but what is specifically shown is the alternating string of @xmath49 particles on a ring with total number of vacancies @xmath50 ; the total number of particles in is not specified , although it is bounded @xmath51 .",
    "the total number of configurations is @xmath52 and therefore @xmath53 this exact result holds independently on the system size . keeping @xmath54 finite and going to the thermodynamic limit we find that the density @xmath43 becomes @xmath55 one computes @xmath56 thereby providing a useful consistency check .    using we can immediately compute the current in the totally asymmetric version of the epa .",
    "each string @xmath43 contributes @xmath57 once we take into account possible choices of the first hopping particle and resulting avalanches .",
    "therefore @xmath58 using we determine the current in the thermodynamic limit @xmath59    the current is also infinite on finite rings if @xmath60 .",
    "when @xmath61 , the current remains finite .",
    "using and one can compute the current in this situation @xmath62 in particular , @xmath63      a configuration at time @xmath64 is fully described by binary variables @xmath65 : if the site @xmath66 is empty , @xmath67 ; if it is occupied , @xmath68 .",
    "the structure of the steady states in the epa is the same as in a repulsion process for which correlation functions have been recently determined @xcite . using these results",
    "we conclude that in the thermodynamic limit the connected pair correlation function is given by @xmath69 for all @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the connected pair correlation function exhibits a pure exponential decay modulated by an oscillating sign .",
    "higher - order correlation functions can be expressed via the pair correlation function , e.g. , the three particle correlation function has a neat form @xmath72 reminiscent of the kirkwood s superposition approximation @xcite which is popular in liquid theory @xcite .",
    "( needless to say , for the eap , and also for the repulsion process studied in @xcite , the above results  are exact rather than an uncontrolled approximation . )",
    "generally the higher - order correlation functions can be written as @xmath73",
    "in this section we consider the totally asymmetric epa .",
    "we study evolving solutions , so our setting is the infinite one - dimensional lattice rather than the ring .",
    "we are interested in a hydrodynamic description which represents the evolution of the density @xmath74 on large spatial and temporal scales . in the hydrodynamic regime , the totally asymmetric epa",
    "is described by the continuity equation with current given by : @xmath75    let us examine solutions which arise when the initial density is a step function @xmath76 there are two types of solutions : rarefaction waves and shock waves .",
    "we assume that both @xmath77 and @xmath78 , so that the system is in the low - density regime where the current is well - defined .",
    "rarefaction waves arise when @xmath79 . to determine how an initial density step evolves",
    ", one can use the method of characteristics @xcite .",
    "the lack of the spatial scale suggests that a simpler approach @xcite is to use the scaling ansatz @xmath80 . plugging this ansatz into eq .   and",
    "solving the resulting equation we find @xmath81   & z_-<z < z_+\\\\ \\rho_+                                   & z > z_+ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with    @xmath82    when @xmath83 , the resulting solution is a shock wave",
    ". the density profile translates with velocity @xmath84 which follows from eq .  .",
    "never - ending avalanches arise when @xmath87 , yet the case of @xmath88 is non - pathological , it corresponds to the complete stasis .",
    "let us analyze solutions to eqs .",
    " when the density in one of the half - space is equal to unity .",
    "the density profile @xmath89 with @xmath77 translates with velocity @xmath90 so we have a shock wave propagating to the left .",
    "unexpected results emerge for the complimentary density profile @xmath91 when @xmath92 , the solution is a combination of two shock waves @xmath93 where @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 . to establish this solution",
    "we notice that one shock wave moves to the left with unit speed , and if @xmath97 is the density to the right of this shock wave , equating the mass transfer yields @xmath98 , from which @xmath99 as it is stated in .",
    "the second shock moves to the right with velocity found from if we plug in @xmath100 .",
    "the simplest solution of this type describes the expansion into vacuum : @xmath101    when @xmath102 , the solution is a combination of a shock wave and a rarefaction wave @xmath103   & 5<z < z_+\\\\ \\rho_+                                   & z >",

    "in the symmetric version , hopping to the left occurs with the same ( unit ) rate as hopping to the right .",
    "each hopping event can trigger an avalanche propagating in the direction of the initiating hop .",
    "steady states are the same as in the asymmetric version , namely the system wanders on the phase space of the maximum - island configurations and each such configuration occurs with the same probability .",
    "the interpretation is different , however : the dynamics is now reversible and the maximum - island configurations are equilibrium configurations since there is no current ; mathematically , previous results ( e.g. , about correlation functions ) continue to hold .      to understand the dynamics at a greater depth",
    ", one would like to describe the approach to equilibrium . similarly",
    "to other lattice gases with reversible dynamics , the hydrodynamic description of the symmetric epa is provided by the diffusion equation @xcite @xmath106\\ ] ]    the diffusion coefficient @xmath107 representing the spread of disturbances generically _ depends _ on the density . in rare cases (",
    "the ssep is the most known example ) the diffusion coefficient is constant .",
    "generally , the computation of @xmath107 is very challenging , and a few density - dependent diffusion coefficients have been analytically determined ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is not surprising if we recall that for classical gases transport coefficients can not be computed even for monoatomic gases with simplest interactions @xcite .",
    "in addition , lattice gases are dense , while classical gases are diluted ; for dense classical gases and liquids , the computation of transport coefficients is unimaginable .",
    "stochastic lattice gases are characterized by a single macroscopic variable , the density , so they are much simpler than classical gases and therefore for some lattice gases the diffusion coefficient is computable .",
    "there is a general scheme based on the einstein - green - kubo formula @xcite that expresses the diffusion coefficient through the current - current correlation function .",
    "current - current correlations are very difficult to compute for deterministic dense gases . for stochastic lattice gases these correlations",
    "are more transparent @xcite , yet successful calculations have been performed in rare cases , mostly for lattice gases satisfying a gradient condition @xcite , i.e. , when the current can be expressed as a discrete gradient of some function . the epa does not satisfy the gradient condition , plus the established einstein - green - kubo scheme @xcite assumes single hopping events rather than potential avalanches of simultaneous hops .    here",
    "we employ an approach which is less general and less justified than the einstein - green - kubo formalism .",
    "this approach relies on the knowledge of the steady states and correlations .",
    "the calculations are rather involved , but the chief prediction is remarkably simple : @xmath108 the small - density asymptotic corresponds to the diffusion of a single particle in the empty system and it coincides of course with the diffusion coefficient of the ssep which is constant : @xmath109 .",
    "the divergence of the diffusion coefficient in the @xmath110 limit is expected , although the precise form may be surprising .    to derive we assume that the system is already close to equilibrium so that between any two adjacent particles there is at least one vacancy .",
    "the density at site @xmath71 can decrease if the site is occupied and the particle hops to a necessarily empty neighboring site , @xmath111 .",
    "when a neighboring site is occupied , the particle can hop to the empty site @xmath71 thereby causing the increase of the density .",
    "these direct hops lead to the change of the average density @xmath112 the index on the left - hand side indicates that this change is initiated by direct hopping ( no avalanches ) .",
    "similarly we find that the change of the average density due to the first induced hop after the original hop is described by @xmath113 extending this argument we determine the change due to the second induced hop after the original hop @xmath114    in the hydrodynamic limit the average density varies on the scales greatly exceeding the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore we write @xmath115 ( the notation @xmath116 emphasizes that we are switching to the continuum description ) , expand @xmath117 in taylor series @xmath118 and recast a difference - differential equation into a classical diffusion equation @xmath119    the right - hand side of eq .",
    "can be shortly written as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 .",

    "we emphasize that whenever the predictions of the above perturbative approach were compared with rigorous derivations available for a few lattice gases satisfying the gradient condition , e.g. , for repulsion processes @xcite , the results fully agreed . for lattice gases of non - gradient type",
    "the perturbative approach also apparently gives exact results , although the supporting evidence is mostly numerical ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenon of self - diffusion refers to the evolution of a tagged particle .",
    "self - diffusion is interesting when a lattice gas is at equilibrium ( as we shall assume in this subsection ) , and it can be studied for an arbitrary lattice gas in arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath138 .",
    "the average position of the tagged particle remains constant @xmath139 the most interesting information is provided by the mean - square displacement .",
    "one anticipates that it exhibits a diffusive growth @xmath140 the coefficient of self - diffusion @xmath141 is unknown even for simplest lattice gases , e.g. for the ssep in dimensions @xmath142 .",
    "( generally , the diffusion of the tagged particle in higher dimensions is described by the self - diffusion matrix , so one should replace by an obvious matrix generalization . )    in one dimension , the coefficient of self - diffusion may vanish .",
    "it happens for all exclusion processes with symmetric hopping when no more than one particle per site and only nearest - neighbor jumps are allowed .",
    "for such exclusion processes the mean - square displacement exhibits a sub - diffusive growth .",
    "this was originally discovered for the ssep where the mean - square displacement grows as @xcite @xmath143 note that as in the general case of normal self - diffusion , @xmath144 is a gaussian distribution characterized by the average and the variance .",
    "the anomalously slow growth of the variance , @xmath145 instead of the usual linear growth , is caused by the fact that the original order of all the particles is forever preserved in one dimension .",
    "the sub - diffusive growth law is not merely an outcome of a toy model , it has been observed in a number of experimental realizations such as diffusion of large molecules in zeolites , transport in super - ionic conductors , etc . , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the @xmath145 growth of the variance should be valid for other one - dimensional exclusion processes with symmetric nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "the amplitude @xmath146 generally depends on the details of the process .",
    "the derivation of , see e.g. @xcite , suggests that @xmath146 can be expressed through the diffusion coefficient @xmath107 and the static compressibility @xmath147 via @xmath148 the static compressibility ( also known as the structure factor ) can be expressed through the connected pair correlation function @xcite @xmath149 using we compute the static compressibility @xmath150    the range of applicability of is not fully understood .",
    "it is proved to be correct for gradient lattice gases , but the epa fails this test , plus all rigorous work disregards avalanches ( only one jump can occur in an infinitesimal time interval ) . on the other hand , the validity of eq .",
    "has been recently justified @xcite for a general class of lattice gases with exclusion constraint ; this has been done in the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "with all these caveats , we now substitute and into and arrive at @xmath151    the small density behavior of @xmath146 matches the behavior in the case of ssep .",
    "the divergence of @xmath146 when @xmath152 is also natural .",
    "note that the behavior of @xmath146 in this limit is less singular than the behaviors of @xmath153 and @xmath107 , see and .",
    "the amplitude of self - diffusion is minimal , @xmath154 , at @xmath155 .",
    "one can determine the diffusion coefficient numerically by measuring the average flux @xmath156 , namely the average number of particles passing through the system of size @xmath1 during time @xmath64 : one sets the density on the left boundary to @xmath157 and the density on the right boundary to @xmath158 , assumes @xmath159 and @xmath160 , and employs relation @xmath161 to probe the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this direct method requires a long running time since the average flux is proportional to @xmath162 , while fluctuations of the flux remain finite even for @xmath163 .",

    ", a particle at the site @xmath171 hops to the right with the same rate 1 as in the bulk , but there are no hopping from site @xmath1 to site @xmath171 . and we add particles to site 1 at rate @xmath172 .",
    "note that the introduction of a particle at site 1 will induce an avalanche if there is a particle at the second site .",
    "this causes the first few sites to behave differently than the bulk for which we derive the hydrodynamic equations : the first site has a higher density than the macroscopic prediction ; the second site has a lower density due to avalanche induced by teh injection of particles at the first site ; the third site has a higher density ; and so on .",

    "there are no restrictions on the length of islands and the duration of the avalanche .",
    "exclusion processes with avalanches are well - defined in the @xmath0 region .",
