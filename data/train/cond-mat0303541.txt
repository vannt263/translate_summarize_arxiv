    "much attention has been focused on vortex states in various type ii superconductors .",

    "recently , several experiments report an  anomalous \" vortex core in high @xmath3 superconductors , which is not expected in an ordinary mixed state : ( 1 ) hoffman , _ et al._@xcite made an scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) observation and found a checkerboard pattern around a vortex core in bi2212 , indicating that the low energy ldos is modified with four - site periodicity .",

    "( 4 ) finally , site - selective nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite show that nuclear magnetic relaxation time @xmath13 at the core site becomes longer as @xmath14 decreases , indicating the lack of ldos at low @xmath14 .",
    "the above facts strongly suggest that in high @xmath3 superconductors the vortex core is quite different from what we expect in `` normal '' @xmath0-wave vortex,@xcite namely a picture that under a small applied field the spatially modulated afm moments are induced centered around a vortex core and simultaneously the zero - energy peak ( zep)@xcite at a core is suppressed .",

    "the implication of these experiments is twofold : the zep in @xmath0-wave vortex core must be present at @xmath21 and in some @xmath22 region , and its contribution enhances @xmath18 in this temperature region .",
    "below @xmath19 , the field induced local afm must exist , which is to remove the zep , giving rise to a suppression of @xmath18 at lower @xmath14 .",

    "we explore a possibility of the induced incommensurate afm moment around a vortex in @xmath0-wave pairing state .",
    "it is quite possible because ( a ) in a @xmath0-wave vortex state the zero - energy quasi - particles produced at a vortex core are readily available for the magnetism and ( b ) these quasi - particles are under strongly correlated environment in cuprates , where the afm state appears near half filling next to the superconducting phase .",
