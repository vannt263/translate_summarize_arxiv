    "<S> it is proposed that all flavor mixing is caused by the mixing of the three quark and lepton families with vectorlike fermions in @xmath0 multiplets of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this simple assumption implies that both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are generated by a single matrix . the entire @xmath4 complex mass matrix of the neutrinos @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> is then found to have a simple expression in terms of two complex parameters and an overall scale . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all the presently unknown neutrino parameters are predicted . </S>",
    "<S> the best fits are for @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the leptonic dirac cp phase is found to be somewhat greater than @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a striking fact that the leptonic mixing angles of the mns matrix @xcite are much larger than the corresponding quark mixing angles of the ckm matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> grand unification suggests a simple explanation for this . in @xmath1 , a family of quarks and leptons </S>",
    "<S> is contained in the multiplets @xmath8 , with the left - handed leptons contained in the @xmath9 and the left - handed quarks contained in the @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if there is more mixing among the @xmath11 multiplets of different families than among the @xmath10 multiplets , the disparity between leptonic and quark mixing angles would be explained . </S>",
    "<S> this idea can be implemented in models based on any grand unified group , since all such groups contain @xmath1 as a subgroup . </S>",
    "<S> several ways of implementing this basic idea have been proposed in the literature @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a model in which the three @xmath8 families of fermions are supplemented by three @xmath12 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> ( the possible existence of such additional  vectorlike \" fermions has been much discussed in the literature in a variety of contexts @xcite . ) the central idea of the model proposed here is that _ all _ inter - family mixing is caused by the mixing between the @xmath9 multiplets of the ordinary families and the @xmath9 multiplets of the additional vectorlike pairs . as a consequence of having this common source , both quark </S>",
    "<S> mixing and lepton mixing are controlled in this model by a single matrix , which we call @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this matrix can be determined from the masses and mixing angles of the quarks alone , and this allows the entire @xmath14 complex mass matrix @xmath5 of the known neutrinos ( which contains 9 real physical observables ) to be predicted in terms of just two complex parameters and an overall mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting formula turns out to be quite simple . in the  flavor basis \" of the neutrinos , i.e. the basis @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the neutrino mass matrix is given by    @xmath16 \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } q e^{i \\beta } & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & p e^{i \\alpha } & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 1 & \\frac{m_s}{m_d } |\\overline{v}_{us}| & \\frac{m_b}{m_d } |v_{ub}| e^{i \\delta } \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{m_b}{m_s } |v_{cb}| \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\mu_{\\nu},\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the overall scale @xmath19 are free parameters of the model , @xmath20 is the kobayashi - maskawa cp phase , and the @xmath21 are the ckm matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> the expression @xmath22 stands for @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> ( since the other quark mixing angles are small , their cosines can be set to one , and we can use simply @xmath24 and @xmath25 . ) note that the ckm elements @xmath21 describing quark mixing enter this formula in such a way that if they vanish the neutrino mass matrix becomes diagonal and the neutrino mixing vanishes also . but while these ckm mixing parameters are small , they are here multiplied by large ratios of quark masses , explaining naturally why the neutrino mixing is of order one . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . ) </S>",
    "<S> we shall see later how this arises .    in this model </S>",
    "<S> , there are three families of fermions denoted by @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , and three vectorlike pairs of fermion multiplets denoted by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) . in the absence of the vectorlike pairs </S>",
    "<S> , the yukawa couplings and mass matrices of the three families would be flavor diagonal , due to discrete symmetries that distinguish the three families from each other . </S>",
    "<S> all flavor mixing is indirectly caused by mass terms that mix the @xmath33 with the @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined by the following quark and lepton yukawa terms :    @xmath35    where the subscript @xmath36 denotes higgs multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalizable yukawa terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) are the most general allowed by the symmetry @xmath37 , where ( for a given @xmath38 equal to 1,2 , or 3 ) @xmath39 is a @xmath40 symmetry under which @xmath41 , @xmath33 , and @xmath42 are odd and all other fields even . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 is a @xmath44 symmetry ( @xmath45 ) under which @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is just one example . </S>",
    "<S> many other simple discrete symmetries would give the form in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . )    </S>",
    "<S> the first four terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) are the standard yukawa terms of @xmath1 grand unification , and are the minimal terms needed to give mass to the known quarks and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> ( as already noted in the original georgi - glashow paper on @xmath1 unification , the presence of a @xmath50 of higgs fields avoids the unrealistic relations between down quark and charged lepton masses that would arise if only a @xmath51 of higgs fields existed @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the fifth term is the standard dimension-5 weinberg operator that gives the left - handed neutrinos majorana masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the symmetry @xmath43 prevents other dimension-5 operators that would give neutrino masses , such as @xmath52 . ) </S>",
    "<S> note that all these standard terms are forced to be flavor diagonal by the @xmath39 symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) are the only ones peculiar to this model . </S>",
    "<S> the first of these simply gives masses to the vectorlike fermions , and the second gives masses that mix these vectorlike fermions with the three families . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs fields in these two terms are gauge singlets , so that their vevs would naturally be superlarge . </S>",
    "<S> all that matters for the purposes of this paper is that the masses coming from these two terms be roughly of the same scale , which we shall call @xmath53 , and that this scale be large compared to the masses of the down quarks and charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> note that the yukawa matrices in these two terms are in general _ not _ diagonal .    </S>",
    "<S> this is the model ; all that remains is to extract its predictions . </S>",
    "<S> first , let us examine the mass matrix of the down quarks that emerges from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are left - handed anti - down quarks in both @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which will be denoted @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there are left - handed down quarks in both @xmath41 and @xmath56 , which will be denoted @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively . altogether , then , there is a @xmath59 mass matrix for the down quarks , given by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . here and throughout the paper , dirac mass matrices are multiplied from the left by the left - handed fermions and from the right by the right - handed fermions ( or , equivalently , the left - handed anti - fermions )    the @xmath59 matrix in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) can be block - diagonalized by multiplying it from the right by a unitary matrix @xmath64 whose elements are of order one ( since the elements of the matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 are of the same order ) and from the left by a unitary matrix whose angles are of order @xmath67 and which therefore can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the unitary matrix @xmath64 is such that    @xmath68    where @xmath69^{-1/2}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal block @xmath70 in the last matrix in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) can be removed by a rotation from the left that is of order @xmath71 , which is negligible , as already noted . </S>",
    "<S> thus , after block - diagonalization , the upper - left @xmath4 block that describes the masses of the three observed down quarks becomes simply    @xmath72    in other words , the net effect of the mixing of the three families with the heavy vectorlike fermions is to multiply the diagonal mass matrix @xmath73 from the right by a non - diagonal matrix @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood diagramatically from fig . 1 .        * fig . 1 * diagrams showing how the mass terms ( @xmath65 ) that mix the @xmath33 with the @xmath34 lead to insertions of the matrix @xmath13 on external @xmath9 fermion lines .    from these diagrams , it is easy to see that such factors of @xmath13 accompany external fermion lines that are in the @xmath9 representation of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the mass matrices for the up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos ( which come , respectively , from @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 terms ) have the form    @xmath78    where the matrices @xmath79 , @xmath73 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are all diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> this can also easily be shown by block - diagonalizing the full mass matrices of the charged leptons and neutrinos in the same way that we did for the down quarks .    </S>",
    "<S> it might seem that the matrix we have called @xmath13 should be different for the different types of fermions due to renormalization effects . at the unification scale , the same @xmath4 matrices @xmath65 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 appear in the @xmath59 mass matrices of the charged leptons and the down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> but , due to gluon loops , the @xmath65 and @xmath66 of the down quarks should run more strongly between the unification scale and the scale @xmath53 than the corresponding matrices of the leptons . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point , however , is that @xmath13 depends on the ratio @xmath82 ; and since gauge boson loops cause @xmath65 and @xmath66 to run in the same way , these effects cancel out in @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the renormalization effects due to yukawa couplings ( which are small for the @xmath9 fermions ) can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it really is the same matrix @xmath13 that appears in @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , this is due to @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is this fact that makes this model so predictive .    to extract the predictions of this model , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider first the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the up quarks are already in the  mass basis \" , since @xmath85 is diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> the down quark mass matrix can be written    @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the 33 element of the diagonal matrix @xmath73 . as we have indicated in the second line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) , the matrix @xmath13 can be brought to triangular form by rotations of the right - handed quarks . then , by rescaling the parameters @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , one can make the diagonal elements of @xmath13 equal to 1 . and finally , by rephasings of the left - handed and right - handed quarks , one can remove all phases except one , which we can place in the 13 element , as shown .    since the up quark mass matrix is already diagonal , </S>",
    "<S> the ckm mixing matrix of the quarks comes entirely from diagonalizing the mass matrix in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show from that equation that @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , the cp phase of the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> ( notice that the basic structure predicted by the model , given in eq.(6 ) , explains why @xmath94 , since @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 . )    </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this implies that @xmath100 , so that the matrix @xmath73 is not only diagonal ( because of family symmetry ) but  hierarchical \" . </S>",
    "<S> ( though the model as presented in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) does not explain the mass hierarchy among the families , we shall see that a simple extension of the model can do this . ) combining the above relations gives    @xmath101    turning to the leptons , one sees that the mass matrix of the charged leptons can be written    @xmath102    we have transformed @xmath13 to have the same form as in the second line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) , by doing the same combination of rotations to the left - handed leptons as we did to the right - handed down quarks , followed by analogous rescalings and rephasings . </S>",
    "<S> if we do the same rotations to the left - handed charged leptons and left - handed neutrinos , no mns mixing is induced at this stage ; but by doing so , it is clear that we also make the matrix @xmath13 appearing in @xmath103 have the same form as in the second line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> what results is precisely the form shown in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) for the neutrino mass matrix . since we only have the freedom to rephase the left - handed neutrinos , there are _ three _ physical phases in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) , rather than one as in the other mass matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the extra two phases are the ones called @xmath104 and @xmath105 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy among the charged lepton masses tells us that @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the diagonal matrix @xmath80 is hierarchical , just as @xmath73 and @xmath79 are . by comparing eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , we see how this model explains the disparity between the neutrino mixing angles and quark mixing angles . because @xmath107 , whereas @xmath108 , the mass matrix of the down quarks has a hierarchy among the _ rows _ , whereas the charged lepton mass matrix has a hierarchy among the _ columns_. since rotations of the _ left - handed _ fermions ( which are the ones relevant to the ckm and mns mixing angles ) are rotations among the _ rows _ , we see that small quark mixing angles and large lepton mixing angles arise . </S>",
    "<S> ( this is a realization of the basic idea of  lopsided \" models @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> the charged lepton mass matrix in the second line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is not yet diagonal , but to a very good approximation it can be diagonalized by rotations done only to the right - handed charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> rotations of the left - handed charged leptons are also required , but they are rotations by angles that are proportional to @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 . the only one of these that is numerically significant is a rotation in the @xmath112 plane by angle @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> this contributes at the 1% level to the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle , and this has only a minor effect on the predictions of the model , as we shall see .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in effect , the mass matrix in the second line of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 9 ) is in the mass basis of the left - handed charged leptons . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the mass matrix @xmath5 shown in eq . ( 1 ) contains all the information about the masses , mixings and cp - violating phases of the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> there are nine physical observables involved : the three neutrino masses , the three mns angles , the dirac cp phase , and the two majorana cp phases of the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> these are all determined by the five model parameters in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) : @xmath19 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .    </S>",
    "<S> since five neutrino observables have already been measured ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) , we can use them to determine the five model parameters , and then predict the four as - yet - unmeasured neutrino observables . </S>",
    "<S> since the equations are non - linear ( they involve trigonometric functions ) , there is no guarantee that they can fit the five measured neutrino properties with five adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> ( to put it another way , the adjustable parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 are bound within the range @xmath121 . ) </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , good fits are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this is only true , however , if some of the measured neutrino properties have values that lie within a smaller range than that presently allowed by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> for example , although the current experimental range of the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is @xmath122 @xcite , the model only obtains good fits for @xmath123 , with values near @xmath124 preferred , as we shall see . </S>",
    "<S> the fits also prefer a value of @xmath116 greater than or equal to @xmath125 , i.e. greater than the present experimental central value . </S>",
    "<S> the quark properties are also constrained : the best fits are obtained with @xmath126 , and @xmath20 greater than or equal to its present experimental central value . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in addition to predicting the four as - yet - unmeasured neutrino observables , the model places non - trivial and testable constraints on the values of quantities that have been measured .    in table </S>",
    "<S> i , we show a representative fit in which all the input quark parameters and the neutrino observables obtained as output are in their experimentally allowed ranges ( and in most cases at their central values ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values are taken from the 2012 review of particle properties @xcite , except for @xmath127 ( the neutrino dirac cp phase ) where we use the result of a recent global analysis of neutrino data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath128 we have used the renormalization group results of @xcite to obtain @xmath129 from @xmath130 , which is given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * table i. * a fit to the quark and neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 , @xmath114 , and @xmath18 are model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath127 is the neutrino dirac cp phase , and @xmath131 the mass that comes into neutrinoless double beta decay .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath132    note that the model s prediction for @xmath127 is @xmath133 radians , which accords remarkably well with the one - sigma range found in @xcite of @xmath134 rad . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath131 ( to which the amplitude of neutrinoless double beta decay is proportional ) is much smaller than the experimental limits , which tend to be in the range of a few tenths of an ev to several evs for different experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction of the model is not very sensitive to variation of the model s input parameters .    figs . </S>",

    "<S> 2 , we have fixed the values of all the quark mass ratios and ckm parameters , and of @xmath116 and @xmath118 , but have allowed @xmath117 and the ratio @xmath135 ( which we henceforth call @xmath136 ) to take different values . </S>",

    "<S> the horizontal lines are the one - sigma limits for @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that @xmath127 is predicted to be roughly @xmath137 radians and that values of @xmath138 are preferred .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we have done a similar thing , but this time fixing @xmath117 to be @xmath124 and allowing @xmath116 and @xmath136 to vary . </S>",
    "<S> one can see a preference for values of @xmath116 equal or above the present experimental central value . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , we have allowed the quark cp phase @xmath20 and @xmath136 to vary . </S>",
    "<S> one sees that the best - fit value of @xmath127 is rather insensitive to the assumed values of the measured quark and neutrino properties , but the width of the range of @xmath127 values that give good fits is quite sensitive . </S>",

    "<S> besides its great simplicity , one feature of the model proposed here that increases its plausibility is that it allows the simple solution to the strong cp problem proposed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all that is required is that cp be assumed to be a symmetry of the lagrangian that is spontaneously broken by the vevs of the singlet scalars @xmath42 that produce the off - diagonal mass matrix @xmath65 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) . in fact </S>",
    "<S> , the model proposed here has the same structure as the model originally proposed by a.e . </S>",
    "<S> nelson in @xcite , except that here the @xmath4 mass matrices of the ordinary three families are required to be flavor diagonal by family symmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> the model proposed here gives an account of how the ckm and mns flavor mixings arise , but does not explain the mass hierarchy among the families , since the hierarchies in the diagonal matrices @xmath79 , @xmath73 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are simply assumed . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , several simple ways in which the present model could be extended to give an explanation of the mass hierarchy . one way is to combine the structure in this model with the structure assumed in @xcite . in that paper , </S>",
    "<S> the mass hierarchies were explained by the three ordinary families mixing with vectorlike @xmath146 fermion pairs in a way analogous to the mixing with @xmath12 assumed here . </S>",
    "<S> combining the structures of the two models would be appealing since it would mean that the vectorlike fermions would comprise entire family - antifamily pairs . </S>",
    "<S> ( it has been pointed out that this can lead in a simple way to unification of gauge couplings in non - susy models @xcite . )    </S>",
    "<S> another possibility would be a froggatt - nielsen scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , instead of the family symmetry assumed above , suppose that the @xmath39 ( @xmath147 or 2 ) were @xmath148 symmetries , under which @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , where the @xmath153 are froggatt - nielsen fields that are @xmath1 singlets . </S>",
    "<S> effective yukawa terms containing factors of @xmath41 would then have to contain equal numbers of factors of @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is some flavor - physics scale . if @xmath156 , a mass hierarchy among families would result . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the hierarchy would be strongest for the up quarks ( for which it is quadratic in the @xmath157 ) , intermediate for the down quarks and charged leptons ( for which it is linear in the @xmath157 ) , and weakest for the neutrinos ( which involve no factors of @xmath157 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the pattern that is observed . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the same relationship among the mass hierarchies is obtained in the approach of @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it should be noted that the present model could be embedded in many grand unified schemes . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in an @xmath158 model , the ordinary families could be in three @xmath159 multiplets , while the vectorlike fermions could be in three @xmath10 multiplets . in @xmath160 , </S>",
    "<S> one gets the extra vectorlike fermions  for free \" , since the @xmath161 contains @xmath162 of @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> different patterns of breaking of the grand unified group could be assumed without affecting the predictions for fermion masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in many unified models , an adjoint higgs field does some of the breaking of the unification group . if that adjoint higgs multiplet does not transform under the @xmath43 symmetry mentioned after eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , it would not couple renormalizably to @xmath163 or @xmath164 and hence not contribute to the matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) and the matrix @xmath13 . consequently , </S>",
    "<S> except for negligible higher - order corrections , the matrix @xmath13 would not  know \" that the unification group is broken , and the same @xmath13 would appear in both the quark and lepton sectors , as is necessary for the model to be predictive .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> if all flavor changing in both the quark and lepton sectors arises as a consequence of the mixing of the ordinary families with vectorlike fermions that are in @xmath165 of @xmath1 , a testable relationship arises between the quark and lepton mixing . </S>",
    "<S> this relationship allows the prediction of the four as - yet - unmeasured neutrino observables as well as testable constraints on several quantities that have been measured . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the dirac cp phase of the neutrinos @xmath127 , as well as more precise determinations of such quantities as @xmath117 , @xmath116 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath20 ( the quark cp phase ) would provide stringent tests of the model . </S>"
