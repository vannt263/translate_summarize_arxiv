    "stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) is one of the most popular tools , used for manipulation of quantum structures @xcite .",
    "this method transfers population adiabatically between two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in a three - level quantum system , without populating the intermediate state @xmath2 .",
    "the applications of stirap cover a huge part of contemporary physics : coherent atomic excitation @xcite , control of chemical reactions @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite , coherent quantum state transfer and spatial adiabatic passage @xcite , waveguide optics @xcite , to name a few .",
    "the technique of stirap is based on the existence of a dark state , which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and is a time - dependent superposition of the initial and target states .",
    "because stirap is an adiabatic technique , it achieves high fidelity only in the limit of adiabatic evolution , which requires large temporal pulse areas .",
    "if the adiabatic condition is not perfectly realized , the nonadiabatic coupling between the eigenstates causes the efficiency of the process to drop down .",
    "several methods to achieve higher fidelity of stirap have been proposed .",
    "one scenario is to use an additional field to cancel the nonadiabatic coupling @xcite .",
    "another approach is to minimize the nonadiabatic losses by applying lewis - riesenfeld inverse engineering @xcite , which has been shown in @xcite to be potentially equivalent to berry s transitionless quantum driving @xcite .",
    "one may also use the dykhne - davis - pechukas formula which leads to the so called parallel adiabatic passage @xcite .",
    "these techniques imply a strict time dependence of the pulse shapes and detuning .",
    "finally , one can use composite pulses to improve dramatically the fidelity of adiabatic passage @xcite , by choosing appropriately the relative phases of the pulses in the sequence .",
    "other theoretical techniques proposed to engineer the shortcuts , with a detailed discussion of the experimental results and prospects , can be found in the recent review @xcite .    in the recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest in the use of non - hermitian ( nh ) hamiltonians @xcite , especially in the context of @xmath3-symmetric systems @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated , for instance , that a @xmath3-symmetric hamiltonian can produce a faster than hermitian evolution in a two - state quantum system , while keeping the eigenenergy difference fixed @xcite .",
    "nh extensions have been done on the classical landau - zener model @xcite and some schemes for the realisation of @xmath3-symmetry have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , an approximation of the adiabatic condition for nh systems was also derived @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a technique to increase the speed of stirap by using a nh term in the hamiltonian to cancel the nonadiabatic coupling ; hence we call this method a nh shortcut to stirap .",
    "the proposed method is similar to the nh shortcut for two - level adiabatic processes , studied in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we shortly review the theory of stirap in the case of resonant excitation .",
    "then we study how additional nh terms in the hamiltonian affect the evolution and we show how nh terms can be used to cancel the nonadiabatic coupling .",
    "we then consider two concrete examples and examine the limitations of our method .",
    "interestingly , for a stirap using delayed gaussian - shaped pulses in the counter - intuitive scheme the imaginary energy terms of the hamiltonian turn out to be time independent . finally , a possible physical implementation of nh shortcut of stirap in waveguide optics is briefly discussed .",
    ", @xmath2 and @xmath1 form a lambda configuration .",
    "the pump field @xmath4 couples states @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the stokes field couples states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "populations of atomic states @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 in ( a ) are mimicked by light power propagating in waveguides @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "waveguide @xmath5 is lossy with loss rate @xmath8 , whereas waveguide @xmath7 provides gain @xmath9 .",
    "the pump ( stokes ) rabi frequency @xmath10 corresponds to the tunneling rate @xmath11 of outer waveguides with the center waveguide.,width=321 ]    we start by briefly reviewing the theory of stirap @xcite .",
    "let us consider a three - level quantum system in a lambda configuration [ fig .",
    "[ system](a ) ] , coherently driven by two external fields , the pump field @xmath4 , and the stokes field @xmath12 .",
    "the goal is to transfer all the population from the initial state @xmath0 to the final state @xmath1 , without populating the intermediate state @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution of the system is described by the schrdinger equation [ schr ] i _ t ( t ) = ( t)(t ) , where the vector @xmath13^t$ ] contains the three probability amplitudes of states @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 . the hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation and assuming exact resonance reads @xcite [ h ] ( t ) = 2 , where the rabi frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath12 of the pump and stokes pulses are assumed to be real .",
    "the mechanism of the population transfer in stirap and the limitation of adiabaticity can be easily understood if we introduce the so - called adiabatic basis .",
    "this is the basis , formed of the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 of the time - varying hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "these _ adiabatic states _ are connected to the original states @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 by [ adbasis ] @xmath18 where the time - dependent mixing angle @xmath19 is defined as ( t ) = _ p(t)/_s(t ) .",
    "the probability amplitudes of the adiabatic states @xmath20^t$ ] are connected to the original ones by using the transformation ( t)=(t)(t ) , where the transformation matrix @xmath21 is given by [ r ] ( t ) = .",
    "the schrdinger equation in the adiabatic basis can be written as [ schra ] i _ t ( t ) = _ a(t)(t ) , with @xmath22 , or explicitly [ ha ] _",
    "a(t ) = , where @xmath23 .",
    "now , if we assume an adiabatic ( slow ) evolution , then @xmath24 which means that if the system is initially in one of the adiabatic states , then it stays in it during the evolution .",
    "it is this type of adiabatic following , which is in the essence of stirap .",
    "let us now take a closer look at the adiabatic state @xmath25 .",
    "we see that it contains only states @xmath0 and @xmath1 and has no component on state @xmath2 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "furthermore , for a _ counterintuitive _ order of the pump and stokes pulses , we have the relations @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence , as time evolves , the mixing angle @xmath28 rises from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and we get = , = - .",
    "this means , that if the evolution is perfectly adiabatic , and the system is initially prepared in state @xmath0 , at the end of the process we will achieve a complete population transfer to state @xmath1 , with negligible excitation of the intermediate state @xmath31 .",
    "however , the evolution is never perfectly adiabatic and some nonadiabatic coupling @xmath32 is always present , which limits the efficiency of stirap . in the next section we show how this problem can be overcome by adding nh terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider again the stirap hamiltonian , but this time we add two time - dependent nh terms @xmath33 in the diagonal @xcite ,    [ hg ] ^(t ) = 2 . which correspond to time - varying complex energies of the bare states @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in the adiabatic basis , this hamiltonian has the form @xmath36.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our goal is to choose @xmath37 in such a way that the terms in the hamiltonian , which cause the evolution of the system to deviate from state @xmath25 , vanish .",
    "this can be achieved by setting [ gamma ] ( t)= , which nullifies the first and the third element from the second column of @xmath38 . in this way",
    "the evolution of the amplitudes of the adiabatic state obey the equations @xmath39 , \\label{a0}\\\\ & a_-(t_f)=0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that initially the state of the system coincides with the adiabatic state @xmath40 , hence @xmath41 .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath4 and @xmath12 are reflections of each other , @xmath42 [ e.g. , if @xmath4 and @xmath12 are identical symmetric functions of time ] , where @xmath43 is the pulse delay , then @xmath37 is an even function of time and @xmath44 is an odd function of time . hence",
    ", if we assume symmetric time interval , @xmath45 , the integral in is equal to zero .",
    "this means that despite the fact that the hamiltonian is nh , the norm of the state vector at the end of the evolution will be equal to unity .",
    "there is , however , an essential distinction between the hermitian and non - hermitian method in the transient population during the evolution . while in the hermitian case the norm of the state vector remains unity during the entire evolution , in the nh stirap , as seen from eq .",
    ", the norm of the state vector will change in time .",
    "as a function of time for gaussian pulse shapes with @xmath46 and @xmath47 . the black dashed line illustrates the standard stirap technique , the solid blue line shows the nh stirap , and the vertical dotted lines mark the initial and final moments of time @xmath48 and @xmath49 , used in the integration of the schrdinger equation .",
    "( bottom ) shapes of the pump and stokes pulses and of the gain / loss function @xmath8(t).,width=566 ]    in order to better illustrate the method of the nh shortcut of stirap , we consider two special cases , and we calculate the nh ( gain / loss ) functions @xmath37 for both of them . as a first example , let us assume that the pump and stokes pulses have gaussian shape , [ gaussians ] @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the peak rabi frequency , @xmath52 is the pulse duration and @xmath43 is the delay between the pulses . for this pulse shape",
    ", it can be easily shown that the gain / loss function of eq .",
    "is constant , [ eq15 ] ( t)=2 .",
    "this time independence of @xmath8 allows one a relatively easy implementation of the nh hamiltonian in waveguide optics , where @xmath8 describes optical amplification / attenuation in the outer waveguides of a three - waveguide structure @xcite , as discussed in more detail in the next section .    in fig .",
    "[ populationgaus ] we plot the evolution in time of the population of the target state @xmath1 , for the regular stirap ( @xmath53 ) and for the nh extension ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we can see from the figure , that the nh stirap strongly outperforms the original hermitian stirap , by achieving complete population transfer , while for the standard stirap we have only @xmath55 for the same values of @xmath51 and @xmath43 .    as a second example we assume hyperbolic secant pulse shapes , [ sech ] @xmath56 in this case",
    ", the gamma term is given by ( t)=. in fig .",
    "[ populationsech ] we show the evolution of the population of the target state , as well as the pulse shapes and @xmath8 .",
    "again , we find that by using the nh stirap , we obtain much higher fidelity , even for parameter values where the ordinary stirap fails .",
    "we want to note here , that both in the cases of gaussian and sech pulse shapes , the function @xmath37 does not depend on the particular value of the peak rabi frequency .",
    "this is an interesting feature , which allows our technique to be used even for small values of @xmath51 , where the usual stirap technique would not work .",
    "but for hyperbolic secant pulse shapes with @xmath57 and @xmath58.,width=566 ]",
    "as anticipated above , our suggested method of nh shortcut to adiabaticity could be physically realized in waveguide optics @xcite . in this case , the system is composed of three optical waveguides @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the geometrical setting schematically shown in fig .  [ system](b ) .",
    "in photonic stirap , the role of rabi frequencies @xmath59 and @xmath60 is played by the tunneling rates @xmath61 and @xmath62 between the center waveguide @xmath6 and the waveguides @xmath5 and @xmath7 respectively . therefore , to implement the desired pulse shape , the separation distance @xmath63 and @xmath64 between outer and center waveguides is slowly varied along the propagation direction @xmath65 . since the tunneling rate scales exponentially with the waveguide separation according to the law @xmath66\\}$ ] ( with @xmath51 and @xmath67 two constant parameters to be determined from the fabrication process ) , in order to implement a gaussian pulse shape a quadratic law for @xmath63 and @xmath64 is required ( see ref .   for further details ) . in our nh generalization of optical stirap , for a gaussian pulse shape , a longitudinally - independent optical loss @xmath9 and an equal rate of net optical amplification @xmath8 should be applied to the outer waveguides @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
