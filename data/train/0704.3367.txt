    "although in general it is not possible to find the effective action which describes a free random walk , the distribution of steps of the random walk of @xmath17 } $ ] has a more natural physical interpretation than an external potential in the diffusion equation . in particular , it will be shown that the distribution of steps of the random walk changes dramatically when casimir scaling changes to screening . while the free diffusion equation ( [ freediffusionequation ] ) reflects stochasticity of yang - mills vacuum at small and intermediate distances , random walk which describes diffusion of wilson loops in the screening regime can only consist of discrete jumps by the elements of the group center , which can be naturally explained in terms of thin center vortices @xcite .",
