    "<S> the growth and dynamics of solid surfaces displays a multitude of power law relationships , which are often associated with geometric self - similarity . in many cases the mechanisms behind these power laws are comparatively trivial , and require little more than dimensional analysis for their derivation . </S>",
    "<S> the information of interest to surface physicists then resides in the prefactors . </S>",
    "<S> this point will be illustrated by recent experimental and theoretical work on the growth - induced roughening of thin films and step fluctuations on vicinal surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the conventional distinction between trivial and nontrivial power laws will be critically examined in general , and specifically in the context of persistence of step fluctuations .    </S>",

    "<S> the savant becomes unpoetic . </S>",
    "<S> _ ralph waldo emerson    per bak s theory of self - organized criticality is based on the observation that power laws are ubiquitous in nature , and the understanding that this observation _ requires a ( general ) scientific explanation_. the latter point is often taken for granted in statistical physics , but it is less self - evident in other disciplines . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it could be argued that the predelection of statistical physicists for power law relationships is a professional deformation , which originates in the success story of the theory of equilibrium critical phenomena . in that context , </S>",
    "<S> power laws are indeed anomalies which require the ingenious machinery of the renormalization group for their explanation .    however , not every power law carries a deep message </S>",
    "<S> . statistical physicists account for this by distinguishing between _ trivial _ and _ nontrivial _ power laws . </S>",
    "<S> though deeply rooted in our jargon , this distinction hard to make precise . </S>",
    "<S> most people would agree that the relation @xmath0 for the mean square displacement of a random walker ( really a manifestation of the central limit theorem ) is a trivial power law , whereas , say , the onsager exponents for the two - dimensional ising model are nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> but consider kolmogorov s 1941 theory of fully developed turbulence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation of the @xmath1-energy spectrum is trivial , in the sense that it uses only dimensional analysis , but it requires the higly nontrivial physical insight that energy dissipation is constant across scales . clearly the demarcation line between the trivial and the nontrivial also evolves with the progress of science .    since the discovery of the fractal nature of diffusion - limited aggregation ( dla ) more than two decades ago @xcite , scaling concepts have become one of the main tools in the study of growth processes in condensed matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while much of the theoretical activity has been driven by the ( still unfinished ) quest of understanding the two most prominent nontrivial power laws in the field  the fractal dimension of dla , and the strong coupling exponents of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite in dimensions larger than one @xcite  experimentalists have begun to routinely employ the concepts of scaling and self - similarity to analyse topographic data in thin film and crystal growth . in the following </S>",
    "<S> i will describe some recent applications of scaling ideas in surface physics . </S>",
    "<S> i will argue that , more often than not , power laws that , by the standards of statistical physicists , are quite trivial , have been of most use in interpreting experimental data and gaining insight into kinetic processes at real surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion will include the currently popular concept of persistence of a stochastic process @xcite , which provides an interesting perspective on the distinction between trivial and nontrivial power laws .     as a function of dip film thickness . </S>",
    "<S> full data points were obtained from atomic force microscopy , and open data points from x - ray diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows a typical fit of the measured scattering intensity to the form expected for a rough surface ( from @xcite),scaledwidth=80.0% ]    our first example is the growth - induced roughening of thin films of an organic semiconductor , diindenoperylene ( dip ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant scaling law is the relationship between the root mean square surface roughness @xmath2 ( the standard deviation of the film height distribution ) and the film thickness @xmath3 , @xmath4 which defines the roughening exponent @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data for @xmath6 shown in fig.[duerr ] are remarkable in several respects . </S>",
    "<S> first , they cover more than two decades in film thickness , and they contain consistent results obtained using two completely different methods , x - ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the second remarkable feature is the experimentally determined value @xmath7 of the roughening exponent . </S>",
    "<S> this value _ exceeds _ the random deposition ( rd ) limit @xmath8 , which applies in the absence of any mass transport between different layers of the growing film @xcite . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> the height follows a poisson distribution , and ( [ sigma ] ) becomes equivalent to the random walk relation ( [ rw ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> random deposition can be approximately realized in the growth of crystalline metal films , where transport between atomic layers is inhibited by step edge barriers ( see below ) . since mass transport processes along the growing surface </S>",
    "<S> are driven by differences in bonding energy , they will generally tend to smoothen the film . </S>",
    "<S> the random deposition roughness @xmath9 would therefore be expected to define an upper bound on the roughness that random fluctuations can induce during the growth of a thin film ; in particular , @xmath10 . in this sense systems with @xmath11 are anomalous , and constitute examples for the ( largely unexplained ) phenomenon of _ rapid roughening _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    but </S>",
    "<S> do the dip data in fig.[duerr ] really violate the rd bound ? to answer this question , it is essential to include also the prefactor of the power law relationship ( [ sigma ] ) in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> denoting by @xmath12 the thickness of a single atomic layer , the random deposition roughness is @xmath13 , which is depicted as a dotted line in fig.[duerr ] . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison shows that the experimental roughness data remain _ below _ the random deposition limit even for the largest film thicknesses . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceivable ( though perhaps not very likely ) that the roughening exponent crosses over to a value below 1/2 before the critical thickness @xmath14 in fig.[duerr ] is reached , and that the early time value @xmath15 is merely a transient ; unfortunately films with thicknesses @xmath16 could not be grown for technical reasons . </S>",
    "<S> if , on the other hand , the measured value @xmath15 is truly asymptotic , then the observed roughness can not be due to the random fluctuations in the deposition beam . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite it was conjectured that quenched in - plane disorder arising from the boundaries of the tilt domains in the organic thin film could be responsible for the rapid roughening behavior . </S>",
    "<S> such disorder is known to induce sublinear roughening behavior of the form @xmath17 , which can mimic a power law with exponent @xmath18 over extended time scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the available experimental information about the growth process on the molecular level is insufficient at present to validate or refute this hypothesis .    </S>",
    "<S> if our understanding of dip film growth , as described above , seems unsatisfactory , it is nevertheless fairly representative of the field as a whole . although the power law relationship ( [ sigma ] ) has been , and is currently being reported for a host of growth systems @xcite , including metallic as well as semiconductor materials and crystalline as well as amorphous films , and although the measured values of @xmath5 tend to cluster around numbers that can be derived from theoretical models @xcite , a clear - cut example , where a well - understood growth mechanism gives rise to a definite prediction for @xmath5 which is quantitatively confirmed by experiment , is so far missing . in particular , 2 + 1dimensional </S>",
    "<S> kpz scaling , a mathematical object under passionate theoretical pursuit for close to twenty years , is still to emerge in any real growth system has been demonstrated for one - dimensional slow combustion fronts in paper @xcite . ] .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the only exception to this statement is mound formation in homoepitaxial crystal growth @xcite , where the exponent @xmath5 describes the roughening of a morphology that , rather than being scale - invariant , displays a distinct lateral length scale . </S>",
    "<S> the growth of `` wedding cakes '' under conditions of strongly inhibited interlayer transport is particularly simple @xcite . in this limit </S>",
    "<S> the roughening exponent takes on the random deposition value @xmath19 , while deviations of the height distribution from the ideal poisson form show up in the prefactor . </S>",
    "<S> the poisson distribution is cut off at large heights because a new layer can be nucleated on top of a mound only when the top terrace has reached a critical size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the expression @xmath20 for the surface roughness , where @xmath21 is the coverage corresponding to the critical top terrace size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ we d ] ) is our first example of a trivial power law where the nontrivial information ( the specifics of the interlayer transport processes that determine @xmath21 @xcite ) resides in the prefactor .    </S>",
    "<S> in the remainder of the paper we will be concerned with the roughening of _ one - dimensional _ objects ( lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> rough lines appear naturally as atomic steps on vicinal crystal surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a vicinal surface is obtained by cutting the crystal in a direction close to ( in the _ vicinity _ of ) a high symmetry plane , and it consists of high symmetry terraces separated by steps of monoatomic height . in thermal equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> , the steps are roughened by thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the step at time @xmath22 by a function @xmath23 , where the @xmath24-axis is taken along the mean step direction and the @xmath25-direction is perpendicular to the step ( in the direction of vicinality ) . up to the length scale where collisions with neighboring steps become important </S>",
    "<S> the static step conformation is the graph of a one - dimensional random walk , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> time - dependent fluctuations are well described by a linear langevin equation of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a positive constant , @xmath29 is white noise , and the _ dynamic exponent _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 depends on the dominant kinetic pathway through which the step fluctuations relax to equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the most important cases are @xmath31 , corresponding to fast mass exchange between the step and the terrace ( _ nonconserved _ kinetics ) and @xmath32 corresponding to mass transport only along the step ( _ conserved _ kinetics ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show from ( [ langevin ] ) that the temporal step correlations scale as @xmath33 by analogy with ( [ sigma ] ) we can say that the roughening exponent of the step is @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> the scaling law ( [ c ] ) has been observed in many experiments , on both metal and semiconductor surfaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the focus in these experiments has usually not been on the power laws as such , which ( in the sense of our introductory discussion ) are rather trivial manifestations of the simple linear dynamics ( [ langevin ] ) . the relation ( [ c ] ) is useful mainly as a classification tool , which serves to identify the dominant step relaxation processes . </S>",
    "<S> the nontrivial ( and materials - specific ) information lies instead in the temperature dependence of the prefactor , which gives insight into the energy barriers governing the atomic processes at the step edge . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such processes are shown in the left panel of fig.[jouni ] . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel shows simulation data for the correlation function @xmath35 , which illustrate the decrease of the prefactor of the @xmath36-law as the kink rounding barrier @xmath37 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by the detailed analysis in @xcite , the activation energy of the prefactor depends linearly on @xmath37 , provided this quantity is larger than the kink energy ( the energy cost for the formation of a kink ) , and therefore a temperature - dependent measurement of @xmath35 can be used to experimentally determine @xmath37 .    . </S>",
    "<S> the detachment from a kink requires the additional energy @xmath38 , and the rounding of the kink the energy @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between kinks is @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> right panel : temporal step correlation function @xmath35 obtained from monte carlo simulations for different values of @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> the step position @xmath23 at fixed @xmath24 is a _ non - markovian _ process in @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - markovian character of a stochastic process manifests itself clearly when considering the _ persistence probability _ , i.e. the probability that the process does not cross a particular value in a specified time interval . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of this quantity requires the knowledge of temporal correlations of arbitrary order . for a gaussian process , such as the solution of the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> all higher order correlation functions are , in principle , encoded in the two - point function ( [ c ] ) , but in practice the calculation of the persistence probability for a general gaussian process is a hard , unsolved problem @xcite .     as a function of the roughening exponent @xmath5 for the linear langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> regime @xmath47 it decays as @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the two persistence exponents @xmath49 and @xmath50 are different . moreover , while the steady state exponent is simply related to the roughening exponent @xmath5 by @xmath51 the transient exponent is truly `` nontrivial '' , in the sense that it can be computed only approximately using a range of fairly sophisticated methods ( see fig.[pers ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship ( [ thetas ] ) provides a good illustration of the fallibility of the distinction between trivial and nontrivial scaling exponents . </S>",
    "<S> on the one hand it would seem that @xmath50 , being simply related to the arguably trivial exponent @xmath5 , should also be classified as trivial . on the other hand the relation ( [ thetas ] ) , while well supported by simulations and plausible scaling arguments , is not rigorously established ; in fact , in the context of the general problem of determining the persistence probability of a gaussian process with known correlator , there is no reason why @xmath50 should be simpler to compute , and hence less nontrivial , than @xmath49 . the scaling relation ( [ thetas ] ) holds because the stochastic process @xmath23 at fixed @xmath24 , in the steady state regime , combines two invariance properties : it is scale invariant _ as well as _ translationally invariant in time@xcite . because it is based on these general principles , ( [ thetas ] ) appears to hold also for non - gaussian interface fluctuations , such as those of the kpz universality class , where not even the temporal two - point correlations ( let alone correlations of higher order ) are explicitly known @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several groups have recently met the challenge of experimentally measuring the persistence probability of one - dimensional interfaces , for steps on vicinal surfaces @xcite as well as for slow combustion fronts in paper @xcite . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the steady state persistence exponent @xmath50 was measured , and the scaling relation ( [ thetas ] ) was confirmed , with @xmath52 @xcite , @xmath53 @xcite and @xmath54 @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the transient persistence exponent ( which is of greater theoretical interest ) has so far not been experimentally accessible , because of the difficulty of preparing the special ( flat ) initial condition that it refers to . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the persistence probability defined by ( [ persistence ] ) , in @xcite also the probability for the step not to cross the _ mean _ step position ( determined as an average over the measured time series ) was considered . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity turns out _ not _ to follow a power law . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in the thermodynamic limit the step position starts , with probability one , infinitely far away from the mean ( the variance of @xmath25 diverges with diverging step length ) ; hence the persistence probability remains at unity and decays exponentially only on a much larger time scale set by the finite length of the step @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimental step persistence data from @xcite are displayed in the right panel of fig.[pers ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the step correlation function in fig . [ jouni ] , the persistence data show no systematic temperature dependence ; the prefactor of the observed power law depends only on the sampling time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the property of a height fluctuation to return ( or not ) to its initial value in a prescribed time interval does not depend on the overall amplitude of the fluctuation ; the persistence probability is a functional only of the _ shape _ of the ( suitably normalized ) correlation function @xcite . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , persistence measurements can not be used to extract energy barriers for specific microscopic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the benefit of these measurements is of a more fundamental nature  </S>",
    "<S> they prove that the theoretical description of step fluctuations through the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) , and the underlying picture of `` universality classes '' encoded by the dynamic exponent @xmath30 , extends beyond the two - point function to correlations of arbitrary order . </S>",
    "<S> as the persistence probability is known to be extremely sensitive to hidden temporal correlations affecting the interface fluctuations @xcite , it may be particularly useful in cases where the assignment of the universality class ( the value of @xmath30 ) through more conventional measurements is ambiguous .    </S>",
    "<S> where does this leave us with regard to the general reflections on power laws , the trivial and the nontrivial , the deep and the shallow , which introduced this paper ? from discussions in the early 1990 s , when soc was challenged by the competing concept of generic scale invariance @xcite , i recall that per bak had a distinct , and rather unfavorable opinion of simple power laws generated by simple equations such as ( [ langevin ] ) : he referred to them as systems operating by the _ garbage in , garbage out _ principle , because they merely perform a ( linear , or , more generally , nonlinear ) transformation of the driving white noise into correlated fluctuations . per viewed self - organization as an essential part of soc . </S>",
    "<S> he emphasized the capability of self - organizing systems to develop new , emergent levels of structure , and to undergo a history which is open to contingent influences . </S>",
    "<S> is a rough surface or a fractal cluster grown by dla self - organized in this sense ? </S>",
    "<S> probably not required to grow a structure of size @xmath55 typically scales as @xmath56 with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably the reason why most spatial power laws in nature extend over less than two orders of magnitude @xcite : under typical physical conditions , there is insufficient time for scale - invariant correlations to develop further . ] . </S>",
    "<S> still , we must accept that many of the power laws in the world that surrounds us have rather humble origins . </S>",
    "<S> as theoretical physicists , our task it to explain these origins ; but as `` experimental philosophers '' ( per bak ) we would also like to know what they _ </S>",
    "<S> mean_. the latter question is of course not one to be answered , but one that is to be constantly clarified ( and reobscured ) in the ongoing discourse of the community . in these discussions per will be sorely missed , and gratefully remembered for a long time to come . </S>"
