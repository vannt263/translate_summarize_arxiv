    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows are most naturally described by the relativistic `` fireball '' model ( see e.g. , paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ; sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) . in this model ,",
    "a compact source releases a large amount of energy over a short time and produces a fireball which expands relativistically as a thin shell .",
    "when the shell encounters the circumburst medium , two shocks are formed  a forward shock which propagates into the circumburst medium and accelerates it , and a reverse shock which propagates into the relativistic shell and decelerates it ( mszros & rees 1992 ; katz 1994 ; mszros , rees , & papathanassiou 1994 ; sari & piran 1995 ; sari , narayan , & piran 1996 ) .",
    "later on , after a significant mass of circumburst medium is accumulated , the shell approaches a self  similar behaviour , as originally described by blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) , where there is only one forward shock propagating into the circumburst medium .",
    "the circumburst medium could be either the interstellar medium ( ism ) or a progenitor wind .",
    "the stability of the blandford  mckee ( 1976 ) solution has been demonstrated recently by gruzinov ( 2000 ) . here",
    ", we analyze the stability of a forward / reverse relativistic shock system .",
    "this double shock system exists during an important phase in the evolution of grbs and its stability has observational consequences . in particular ,",
    "oscillations or instabilities could translate to specific patterns of temporal variability in the lightcurves of grb afterglows .",
    "in our linear perturbation analysis we generalize the `` thin shell '' method first introduced by vishniac ( 1983 ) in the non  relativistic regime .",
    "this method simplifies the equations describing the stability of a spherical shock when the wavelength of the perturbation is much larger than the thickness of the shocked shell . in our relativistic treatment",
    "we focus on global perturbations for which the wavelength is much larger than the thickness of the forward / reverse shock system .",
    "we consider the regime of grb parameters where the reverse shock is relativistic ( although in reality it may also be non - relativistic ) . in ",
    "2 we derive the perturbation equations for the forward / reverse shock system . in ",
    "3 we show the analytical results for the wind case and the numerical results for both the wind and ism cases .",
    "finally , in  4 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the interaction between a relativistically expanding shell and the circumburst medium results in a double shock system , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the system includes four distinct regions : the circumburst medium ( region 1 ) and the shocked circumburst medium ( region 2 ) are separated by the forward shock ( shock 1 ) , while the shocked material in the shell ( region 3 ) and the unshocked material in the shell ( region 4 ) are separated by the reverse shock ( shock 2 ) .",
    "region 2 and 3 are separated by a contact discontinuity .",
    "our analysis is done in the observer frame where the circumburst medium is at rest .",
    "we use a spherical coordinate system whose origin is located at the center of the explosion .",
    "the radii of the contact discontinuity , shock 1 and shock 2 are denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "we refer to the combination of region 2 and 3 as the layer whose stability we consider . similarly to vishniac ( 1983 ) we make the thin shell approximation , i.e. assume that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the wavenumber of the perturbations .",
    "note that although shock 1 is relativistic , shock 2 could be either relativistic or nonrelativistic . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the situation where shock 2 is relativistic .",
