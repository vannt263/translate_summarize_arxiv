    "in normal metals there are well known shubnikov - de haas oscillations of resistance in a high magnetic field @xcite . in superconductors oscillations of magnetoresistance also occur and they do not require such high magnetic fields .",
    "the scale of oscillations in many cases is related to the magnetic flux quantum @xmath6 .",
    "oscillations in magnetic field in superconductors has a long history @xcite .",
    "oscillations can occur in josephson junctions , as little and parks effect , due to variation of number of phase slips centers and lines , in layered and granular superconductors , due to artificial geometrical restrictions , etc .",
    "every oscillation effect in superconductors has clear and well studied background . at first sight ,",
    "unlikely another oscillation phenomenon may exist whose mechanism is mysterious , that is outside the circle of known effects .",
    "nevertheless the unusual oscillating magnetoresistance , experimentally observed in @xcite , stays well apart .",
    "its underlying mechanism can not be reduced to a combination of known effects since the periodic positions of @xmath5 peaks are universal , that is material independent . in layered compounds observed peak positions are independent on direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the observed properties are compatible with a subatomic mechanism which controls conduction electrons in a relatively large volume .",
    "this would provide material independence since subatomic states have no resemblance to atoms of the solid .",
    "such a construction looks paradoxical for two reasons : ( i ) formation mechanism of electron states with subatomic size is unclear and ( ii ) it is unclear how a subatomically small state can control conduction electrons responsible for macroscopic properties .",
    "the mechanism of formation of subatomic states in condensed matter is unusual . under the electron - photon interaction",
    "the electron `` vibrates '' with the mean displacement @xmath7 and the mean squared displacement @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this is the fluctuation spreading in addition to the usual quantum mechanical uncertainty @xcite .",
    "for example for the harmonic oscillator @xmath10 the total mean squared displacement is @xmath11 . in this language",
    "the `` vibrating '' electron probes various parts of the potential and therefore changes its energy ( lamb shift ) @xcite .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "regardless of a form of the potential , the electron wave function can be singular along the @xmath12 axis as @xmath13 where @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the kinetic energy term @xmath15 is singular as @xmath16 . to compensate this singularity in the wave equation the artificial @xmath16",
    "should be added as a formal potential well .",
    "such singularity source is absent in reality and therefore the singular state does not exist even formally",
    ".    however the singularity source appears on short distances , @xmath17 , from the singularity line due to the mechanism of electron mass formation @xcite . then under the interaction with photons , electron `` vibrations '' smear the singularity into the thread of the radius @xmath18 along the @xmath12 axis . within the thread the term @xmath15 goes over into @xmath19 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , that large kinetic energy is compensated by the counter - term that can be interpreted as anomalous well along the thread .",
    "this term is formed by the variation in space of zero point electromagnetic energy on the distance @xmath0 around the thread .",
    "the resulting state is smooth in space and therefore physical .",
    "it is localized within the thread of the thickness @xmath18 .",
    "the thread is not necessary linear .",
    "the subatomically thin thread can be in the form of a ring of the atomic radius . in a metal",
    "the role of such rings is unusual due to orbital momenta @xmath20 of the ring along the @xmath12 axis perpendicular to the ring plane .",
    "close to the thread ( on the compton length ) relativistic effects are strong resulting in @xmath21 coupling analogous to @xmath22 coupling in some atoms . due to the interaction with photons ,",
    "the state of the fermi energy is split by two ones , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is similar to the lamb split in hydrogen atom where , instead of @xmath12 component , total momenta are involved due to spherical symmetry .",
    "those states , with energy split for opposite spins , continue from the thread ring to larger distances going over into conduction electrons of @xmath25 energy .",
    "the narrow stiff region near the thread plays a role of a boundary condition for conduction electrons moving in crystal field .",
    "this keeps electrons with opposite spins in the volume ( on the length of spin - orbit relaxation ) to be separated by discrete lamb energies . the driving force for that spin imbalance state is thread rings distributed in the volume .",
    "the spin imbalance state of conduction electrons , with discrete energy splits for opposite spins , influences the cooper pairing condition in the fluctuation region close to @xmath1 .",
    "the fluctuation correction to the resistance of normal metal is determined by the fluctuation propagators which depend on energy shifts of different spin states .",
    "these energy shifts can be subsequently turned to zero by the external magnetic field .",
    "therefore the resulting @xmath5 dependence becomes oscillating as in experiments .",
    "actually the measurements @xcite probe the spin imbalance state in the volume of a metal .",
    "in contrast to known mechanisms of @xmath5 oscillations , the spin imbalance mechanism does not depend on macroscopic inhomogeneities of samples .    in sec .",
    "[ mechanism ] usual oscillation are analyzed . in secs .",
    "[ anom ] , [ shape ] , and [ states ] the mechanism of anomalous states is studied . in sec .",
    "[ spin ] spin imbalance states are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ cooper ] effects on the fluctuation region are investigated .",
    "in the film with the artificial periodic two - dimensional structure the oscillatory magnetoresistance is due to effects generic with little - parks phenomenon .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the period of @xmath26 oscillations was determined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unitary cell area of the structure .",
    "an oscillatory behavior of resistance is also possible when the superconducting sample consists of natural grains of the typical size @xmath29 @xcite . in this case",
    "the typical distance between peaks of @xmath5 is also determined by the geometrical condition ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the film surface @xmath30 the area @xmath28 is determined by grain structure on that surface .",
    "when the field is perpendicular to the side surface @xmath31 the corresponding @xmath28 is less ( a larger @xmath32 ) due to the geometrical restriction by the finite thickness .",
    "this clear property , dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath33 direction , was observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that in a naturally disordered sample grain sizes can not be equal resulting in a perfect periodicity of @xmath5 with the period ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "analogously the perfect periodicity is not expected with the same @xmath32 in samples of different materials and differently manufactured .",
    "the two main features distinguish the oscillatory magnetoresistance observed in @xcite : independence of @xmath32 on @xmath33 direction and independence of @xmath32 on sample choice .      in experiments @xcite",
    "the distance @xmath32 between maxima of @xmath5 is constant with the accuracy of @xmath34 .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 is the same for all @xmath33 directions .",
    "this points to a different mechanism of the oscillations of magnetoresistance compared to the geometrical origin ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "indeed , films thickness in @xcite is smaller than @xmath29 and therefore projections of grain areas to the side surface and upper one can not be equal",
    ". therefore the nature of magnetoresistance oscillations in that case is not of geometrical origin ( [ 10 ] ) , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but qualitatively different .",
    "@xmath32 was revealed to be equal for @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this independence of @xmath32 also looks surprising and says against the geometrical origin ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "otherwise samples of different materials have to have identical and perfectly periodic grain structure .",
    "the stable feature ( independence of macroscopic properties ) of magnetoresistance oscillations says about a subatomic mechanism as mostly probable one . in geometrical effects ,",
    "generic with little - parks one , magnetoresistance oscillations occur due to periodic in @xmath26 diamagnetic pair breaking .",
    "associated @xmath32 is analogous to ( [ 10 ] ) and is not universal with respect to different @xmath33 directions .",
    "in contrast , the mechanism of paramagnetic pair breaking is promising since it is not geometrical and therefore is expected to provide no angular @xmath33 dependence .",
    "but such a mechanism should also result in the oscillatory @xmath5 .",
    "it is not clear a priori how it can be .    in this paper",
    "we investigate that phenomenon .",
    "it is shown that anomalous electron - photon states are likely responsible for the observations @xcite .",
    "since the observed oscillations are universal , this drives to analyze a possible subatomic mechanism to avoid a dependence on material choice and @xmath33 direction .",
    "the subatomic mechanism , considered from usual atomic distances , look like a singularity of the wave function . at shorter ( subatomic ) distances",
    "the singularity has to be washed out within the certain small scale . in this section",
    "we show that such anomalous states can really exist .",
    "first , we consider an electron without an interaction with any ( in particular , electromagnetic ) fluctuating field to be included as the second step .",
    "such electron is described by a quantum mechanical wave equation in some static potential @xmath37 . when the potential is physically smooth",
    ", the schrdinger equation in the space @xmath38 @xmath39 can have the singular solution , which is @xmath13 at @xmath40 , extended along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "this solution requires the singularity source @xmath16 in the right - hand side of ( [ m0 ] ) .",
    "this source is absent in this equation and therefore that singular solution does not exist even formally .",
    "however it is not clear whether such source appear under the reduction of @xmath41 when the formalism ( [ m0 ] ) is not valid .",
    "the schrdinger description ( [ m0 ] ) of that singularity holds at @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the electron compton length . at @xmath44",
    "one has to use the dirac quantum mechanics for the bispinor @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two spinors satisfying the equations for free electron @xcite @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the total relativistic energy and @xmath50 are pauli matrices . in equations ( [ m1 ] )",
    "the gradient terms are large and the static potential is neglected since it is less than @xmath51",
    ". equations ( [ m1 ] ) follow from the dirac lagrangian @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 are dirac matrices , @xmath54 is the dirac conjugate , and the partial derivatives are @xmath55 .",
    "it follows from ( [ m1 ] ) that @xmath56 to be specific , one can choose the spinor @xmath57 in the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 satisfies the equation @xmath60 this equation is similar to ( [ m0 ] ) ( with no potential ) when @xmath61 and the energy @xmath62 is small compared to @xmath51 .    as follows from eq .",
    "( [ m5 ] ) , at small @xmath41 the term with @xmath63 dominates and the singular solution @xmath64 also requires the singularity source @xmath16 which is absent in ( [ m5 ] ) . therefore our attempt to naturally get a singularity source at smaller @xmath44 failed .",
    "the singular solution , continued to the region @xmath44 , does not exist as in the scrdinger formalism .",
    "note that at @xmath44 the combination @xmath65 dominates but at @xmath42 the term @xmath66 is the principal one related to the scrdinger equation .      below we analyze what happens to the singularity on much shorter distances @xmath41 compared to the electron compton length @xmath67 .",
    "also one should specify a physical origin of that shorter distance .    according to the standard model ,",
    "masses of electron , other leptons , @xmath68 and @xmath69 weak bosons , and quarks are generated by the higgs field @xcite .",
    "electron acquires its mass through the connection between the fermion field @xmath70 , which includes electrons , and the higgs field @xmath71 . instead of the electron mass in the lagrangian ( [ m2 ] ) the term",
    ", connecting @xmath70 and @xmath71 , appears .",
    "one should formally substitute @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "so the last part in the lagrangian ( [ m2 ] ) is @xmath75 which is called the yukawa term .",
    "the higgs field @xmath76 contains the fluctuating part @xmath77 for which @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the electron mass @xmath79 is determined by the expectation value @xmath80 of the higgs field @xmath81    besides the generation of electron mass , the yukawa @xmath71 depending term in the lagrangian also influences the higgs field .",
    "as above , we consider the problem without fluctuating gauge fields @xmath82 ( @xmath83 relates to photons ) and the fluctuating part @xmath77 of the higgs field . in this case",
    "the expectation value @xmath80 of the higgs field obeys the equation @xcite @xmath84 the right - hand side of ( [ m7 ] ) can be calculated according to dirac quantum mechanics @xcite @xmath85 since fluctuating fields are absent .",
    "( [ m7 ] ) , producing the finite expectation value of the higgs field , reminds the ginzburg - landau equation .",

    "masses of the fields @xmath105 and @xmath77 are large , about of @xmath106 .",
    "for this reason , fluctuations of these fields result in a less fluctuation length compared to fluctuations of the massless photon field @xmath83 . therefore for study of singularity smearing one can account for solely the electron - photon interaction .    to generally understand how the singularity is washed out",

    "so the states in the well relate to the non - perturbative approach and they are exact .",
