    "the microwave response of superconductors is of great interest in several temperature and magnetic field regions , since it carries information about both macroscopic and microscopic quantities , such as resistivity or electromagnetic penetration depth .",
    "most of available experimental data are restricted to fixed frequencies ( resonant cavity techniques ) , whereas a study over a continuous frequency spectrum would allow for a deeper investigation of the dynamical behaviour of the system . an experimental technique which makes it possible to evaluate",
    "the complex surface impedance @xmath2 of a superconducting film as a function of frequency has been proposed in the past by some groups @xcite@xcite .",
    "the technique is based on the measurement of the reflection coefficients at the input of a coaxial line terminated by the film ( corbino disk ) .    extracting the contribution of the sample from the measured data",
    "is a critical step during data analisys : in fact , the contribution of the coaxial line is in general of the same order of magnitude of that of the sample .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present the most recent results on this experimental procedure , as obtained in our laboratory .",
    "the electromagnetic field is generated and analized by a vector network analizer ( vna ) , connected to the sample by a commercial coaxial cable ( cutoff frequency : 60 ghz ) , about 3.5 meters long ( 1 meter inside the cryostat and 2.5 meters outside ) .",
    "such a large distance is needed since the experimental setup has been studied for high magnetic field measurements and the vna needs to be placed as far as possible from the magnet . on the other hand",
    "such a high length results in a heavy attenuation of the signal , especially at higher frequencies , which prevented us to perform measurements above 35 ghz and resulted in highly noisy measurements above 20 ghz .",
    "the sample surface impedance is probed as a function of frequency through a corbino disk geometry , in which the sample shortcircuits the above mentioned cable .",
    "temperature is varied employing a helium flow cryostat .",
    "the connection between the cable and the sample is realized through a double spring method , extensively described in @xcite . with respect to previous realizations",
    ", a thin indium ring has been placed between the sample and the outer connector of the cable , to reduce the possible damage of the sample .",
    "however this was not sufficient to suppress a detectable contact capacitance .",
    "the capacitance effect results to be smaller for the @xmath1 film than for the @xmath0 film , suggesting that the sample surface plays a relevant role in the overall contact realization . as a result of this spurious capacitance ,",
    "data on @xmath0 are not reliable below 6 ghz , while in the case of @xmath1 the capacitance masks data only below 0.5 ghz , so that the actual frequency range over which measurements will be presented in the following of the paper is limited to @xmath3 ghz for @xmath0 and @xmath4 ghz for @xmath1 .",
    "the samples here considered are a thin ( 2200 ) , square ( l = 10 mm ) @xmath0 film , grown by planar high oxygen pressure d.c , sputtering on a @xmath5 substrate @xcite , and a thin ( 1500 ) , square ( l= 5 mm ) @xmath1 film , grown by pulsed laser deposition with a conventional two step technique on a sapphire substrate @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the problem issued in this paper is how to extract the surface impedance @xmath6 of the sample from the reflection coefficients @xmath7 measured at the beginning of the coaxial cable .",
    "@xmath6 is defined as the ratio between transverse electric and magnetic field components at the sample surface .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate @xcite,@xcite that @xmath8 is related to the reflection coefficient at the sample surface @xmath9 through the relation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the characteristic impedance of the dielectric filling the cable .",
    "we estimate it in @xmath12 ( vacuum impedance ) being the last section of the cable is not filled with the dielectric . due to the very small thickness of the samples ,",
    "the thin film approximation is always valid @xcite and one has @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the complex resistivity of the sample .    in principle",
    ", the values of @xmath9 can be extracted from the measured reflection coefficient at the vna input @xmath7 through the standard relation @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are complex parameters taking into account cable effects .",
    "they depend on frequency and on the temperature of the whole cable .",
    "these three cable coefficients can be determined by measuring the response of three known loads replacing the sample ( line calibration ) but in our case the experimental setup does nt allow for a full calibration of the cable during measuring sessions since the measurement cell is inaccessible and calibration standards are not available at the temperatures of interest in this work .",
    "however , we performed daily calibration of the section of the cable external to the cryostat , hence from here on we will no further consider it , as if the vna were directly connected to the internal , one - meter long , cable .",
    "this means that the cable coefficients and reflection coefficients dealt with in the following are only relative to the internal cable . before the beginning of the measuring session",
    "we measure and store the coefficients of the internal cable at room temperature @xmath19 .",
    "we then define @xmath20 as : @xmath21 as can be seen inverting equation [ gammam ] at @xmath22 we have @xmath23 . to find a relation between @xmath20 and @xmath9 at @xmath24 , we put @xmath25",
    "as obtained from equation [ gammam ] into equation [ gammamtilde ] ( we will omit in the following the explicit frequency dependence for the sake of compactness ) : @xmath26}\\ ] ] we expect cable coefficients not to change by more than 10% for any variation of the temperature profile in the cable . moreover , during the room temperature calibrations , we found @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be quite generally no more than 10% of @xmath29 , which is instead of the same order of @xmath30 .",
    "this means that @xmath31 and we can neglect it in equation [ gamma0prima ] , obtaining after some algebra @xmath32}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 .",
    "again @xmath34 and @xmath35 so that one gets , to within a few percent of precision , @xmath36 we want here to stress that this just defined coefficient @xmath37 depends in a non - trivial way upon the whole temperature profile of the cable so that no practical measurement of it is possible . nevertheless , when performing measurements at low t @xmath38 , it is reasonable to expect that it is almost constant when varying the temperature of the sample of a few tens of kelvin ; the cable is in fact thermally constrained at room temperature at the entrance of the cryostat so that the temperature profile of the cable only slightly changes for such variations of the temperature of the sample .",
    "we can also roughly estimate the frequency dependence of @xmath37 considering that it is the ratio between two transmission coefficients at different temperatures .",
    "since @xmath39 takes into account the attenuation of the field due to losses through the dielectric and on the cable conductors , it decreases with increasing frequency and temperature .",
    "we can then expect that , if @xmath24 , @xmath40 and , as can be seen in figure [ gmtilde(nu ) ] , it will increase with frequency .",
    "let s now consider the difference between two determinations of @xmath41 with respect to two different values of the temperature , say @xmath42 and @xmath43 . making use of equation [ zs ] ,",
    "we can write @xmath44 where the approximation involved in the last equivalence is possible if @xmath45 ( see below ) . writing as usual @xmath46 we have @xmath47 } \\label{rsprima}\\ ] ] @xmath48}{1+|\\frac{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{1})}{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{2})}|^{2}+2re[\\frac{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{1})}{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{2 } ) } ] } \\label{xsprima}\\ ] ] if the phase variation @xmath49-\\phi[\\gamma_{0}(t_{2})]$ ] between the two determinations of @xmath50 is small , we have @xmath51\\simeq   \\left|\\frac{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{1})}{\\gamma_{0}(\\nu , t_{2})}\\right|$ ] and equations [ rsprima ] and [ xsprima ] can be approximated as @xmath52 @xmath53 where we used the result stated in equation [ gamma0finale ] into the last approximations .",
    "if we have @xmath54 , so that @xmath55 , equation [ rs0 ] can finally be rewritten as @xmath56 if we also have @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 , then equation [ xs0 ] can be approximated with @xmath59 formulae [ rsm ] and [ xsm ] are the main result of this paper .",
    "they relate the variation of impedance between two different temperatures to the measured quantities .",
    "this means that , if a reference temperature @xmath60 exists for which @xmath61 , we can extract from @xmath62 the variations of the curves @xmath41 with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , once all the @xmath64 are known , if a temperature @xmath65 exist for which the curve @xmath66 is known , we can get absolute values for @xmath41 .",
    "finally , we have found two different formulae for the real and imaginary part of the impedance , so that we can handle them separately .      to employ equations [ rsm ] and [ xsm ]",
    "we must check that the approximations underlying them are all valid . for the sake of simplicity we analyze the specific case of @xmath1 , being the procedure for @xmath0 exactly the same .",
    "first of all we will deal with the approximations on the temperature behaviour of @xmath37 .",
    "in figure [ gmtilde(t ) ] we show a typical curve at fixed frequency of the modulus and phase of @xmath67 . in order to estimate the contribution to these curves due to @xmath37 we have to roughly guess the behaviour of @xmath68 , being from equation [ gamma0finale ] @xmath69 and @xmath70 . to do this , first we recall that @xmath68 is linked to @xmath41 by relation [ zs ] , that can be inverted to @xmath71 above @xmath72 the resistivity is real , and so are the impedance and @xmath73 .",
    "being @xmath74 we have @xmath75 so that its phase is @xmath76 . moreover above @xmath72 the resistivity is independent from frequency and we can compare microwave with dc measurements , finding that the resistivity is almost constant with temperature , so that @xmath77 is also nearly constant . below the transition temperature the real part of",
    "the impedance attains a value much lower than the normal state one , so that we expect @xmath78 , which , according to equation [ gammadizeta ] implies @xmath79 . as regarding the phase of @xmath80 , using the two fluids model",
    "one can predict a peak near the transition temperature and a plateau sufficiently below it , whose value is very close to @xmath76 .",
    "we note in figure [ gmtilde(t ) ] that @xmath81 is almost constant sufficiently above and below the transition temperature .",
    "since @xmath82 is constant in these regions of temperature , we conclude that the small variations observed in @xmath81 are due to @xmath83 .",
    "we can then state that @xmath83 does not appreciably vary across the whole curve so that we can neglect its variations with respect to those of @xmath84 and apply equation [ rsm ] .",
    "as regards the phase of @xmath85 , it is evident from figure [ gmtilde(t ) ] that the phase of @xmath67 shows a peak at the transition temperature that can be ascribed to @xmath86 , but it is as much evident that @xmath87 has not the same value above and below @xmath72 .",
    "this means that the condition @xmath57 does nt hold and we ca nt make use of equation [ xsm ] to get sample reactance .",
    "nevertheless we can estimate from this graphic the maximum variation of @xmath86 in about 10 degrees , so that the approximation @xmath88 is well justified .",
    "the last condition to be examined is the one employed in equation [ deltagamma0 ] : we need a reference temperature for which we are confident that @xmath89 . from the above discussion on @xmath50 and from figure [ gmtilde(t ) ] we can state that @xmath61 for @xmath90 .",
    "we choose @xmath91 for @xmath92 and , for analogous reasons , @xmath93 for @xmath0 .",
    "the result of this procedure for the real part of @xmath94 is shown for the mgb@xmath95 film in fig.[r1(t)_mgb2 ] , where resistive transitions at different frequencies are plotted .",
    "the transition widens with increasing frequency , being nearly frequency independent up to @xmath96 2 ghz and then widening as the frequency is further increased . to have a more quantitative description of the widening",
    ", one can define @xmath97 as the temperature where the resistivity , at the given frequency @xmath98 , reaches one half of the value in the normal state , and @xmath99 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath100 , normalized to the value of @xmath101 at @xmath102 ghz is reported in fig .",
    "[ delta_tc ] ( filled circles ) .",
    "the same analysis is presented in fig.[r1(t)_ybco ] , for @xmath0 where curves of @xmath103 are presented as a function of @xmath104 at various frequencies .",
    "the real part of the resistivity remains almost zero up to @xmath105 , then grows at @xmath101 rapidly reaching the normal state value . as in the case of @xmath1 ,",
    "the transition widens as the frequency is increased . however , the widening is relatively small compared to @xmath1 and the upper part of the transition is almost unaffected by the variation of the frequency , being only the very last part of it severely dependent on frequency .",
