    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , a non - abelian gauge theory @xcite with a gauge group @xmath3 , is now regarded as the fundamental theory for describing strong interactions among quarks , gluons and hadrons as their bound states . since asymptotic freedom",
    "@xcite exists in qcd with @xmath4 quark flavors less than 33/2 , one can predict the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior of qcd by perturbation theory in a reliable way . in order to discuss the infrared ( ir ) behavior , on the other hand",
    ", we must solve the strong coupling problem beyond the perturbation theory . in the ir region , indeed , the perturbation theory itself can not be a reliable method of calculations .",
    "hence , we need inevitably non - perturbative methods .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that the perturbation theory can not provide any information on the ir behavior of qcd , as will be shown in this article .",
    "one of the most direct methods to study the non - perturbative features of quantum field theory would be to write down and solve the schwinger ",
    "dyson ( sd ) equation .",
    "the sd equation is a set of self - consistent equations among green functions and constitutes a series of exact equations .",
    "however , the sd equations consist of the infinite number of simultaneous non - linear integral equations . in actually solving the sd equation ,",
    "therefore , one needs to perform a certain truncation which can not be justified within the framework .",
    "nevertheless , the approximate solutions have become an efficient tool for studying non - perturbative problems which can not be reached by perturbative method , e.g. chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "see e.g. , reviews @xcite .",
    "so far , the extensive studies of the sd equations in qcd have almost been restricted to the sd equation for quark propagator ( referred to as quark sd equation hereafter ) , see figure  [ fig : qcd - ym_sdeq](a ) . in order to study gluodynamics ,",
    "we must solve the coupled sd equations for the gluon and faddeev  popov ( fp ) @xcite ghost propagators , see figure  [ fig : qcd - ym_sdeq](b),(c ) .",
    "of course , solving them is more difficult than solving the quark equation alone .",
    "this is mainly because the sd equations for gluon and ghost are _ truly non - linear _ coupled equations .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the quark sd equation studied so far .",
    "an origin of this non - linearity comes from the treatment in which both propagators are incorporated on equal footing , see figure  [ fig : qcd - ym_sdeq](b),(c ) . in the conventional treatment of the quark sd equation ,",
    "the gluon propagator was replaced by hand with the free propagator ( ladder approximation ) or dressed propagator in the one - loop resumed level ( improved ladder approximation ) and consequently the problem was reduced to solving the quark propagator alone .",
    "another origin of non - linearity comes from the fact that gluon and ghost are bosons .",
    "the quark sd equation can be decomposed into two equations for the mass function and the wave - function renormalization function .",
    "the equation for the quark mass function can be linearized as a good approximation or in the rigorous sense ( bifurcation technique ) due to a fact that quark is a fermion .",
    "the _ general solution _ for the mass function can be obtained by adopting either method of linearizations .",
    "once the general solution is obtained , it can be used to study the whole range of momenta .",
    "this fact facilitates considerably the analysis of the quark mass function .     denotes the full quark propagator , @xmath5 the full ghost propagator and @xmath6 the full gluon propagator , while @xmath7 denote the four types of vertices .",
    "the pure yang - mills part is enclosed by the broken line .",
    ", height=529 ]    in recent several years , extensive analytical studies @xcite of the coupled sd equations for gluon and ghost propagators were performed to obtain the infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) asymptotic solutions in the @xmath8 yang  mills theory restricted to the landau gauge .",
    "the leading term of the uv asymptotic solution recovers the one - loop resumed perturbation theory due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "in fact , the solutions for the euclidean gluon propagator @xmath9 and ghost propagator @xmath10 ( @xmath11 for @xmath8 ) have the expected uv forms @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath6 are @xmath14-independent constants and the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent of the number of colors @xmath17 in @xmath8 yang - mills theory at one - loop level , i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    a remarkable characteristic of gluodynamics claimed by von smekal",
    ", hauck and alkofer @xcite and subsequently confirmed by atkinson and bloch @xcite in a simpler framework is that the euclidean gluon propagator behaves like a power of the momenta in the ir limit of vanishing momenta @xmath20 : @xmath21 and the gluon propagator is suppressed in the ir regime for @xmath22 , while the euclidean ghost propagator is enhanced to be more singular than the free one in the ir limit @xmath20 : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are @xmath14-independent constants .",
    "this result is surprisingly due to dominant contribution from the ghost loop in ir region .",
    "however , the value of the exponent @xmath26 varies in the range @xmath27 depending on the way of truncation @xcite . at present",
    ", the precise value of @xmath26 is not known .",
    "therefore , it is still under the debate whether the gluon propagator converges to a finite non - zero value ( @xmath28 ) or vanishes ( @xmath29 ) in the ir limit @xmath20 .. however , this is not necessarily the case in the continuum limit due to the renormalization effect , see pp.146147 of @xcite . ]",
    "it should be remarked that such behaviors of gluon and ghost propagators were first predicted by gribov @xcite .",
    "his result corresponds to @xmath30 : @xmath31 where the mass scale @xmath32 is called the gribov scale .",
    "a serious problem is that at present one does not have any _ analytical method _ for connecting in the intermediate region two asymptotic solutions to obtain the complete solution over the whole range of momenta .",
    "only the numerical studies have succeeded in obtaining the complete solution in this sense .",
    "therefore , there is no guarantee that a specific ir asymptotic solution obtained in the analytical study can be a piece of the complete solution which must reduce to the uv asymptotic solution in the large momenta .",
    "there is also a problem of uniqueness of the solution @xcite , since the ir asymptotic solution is obtained based on a specific ansatz for the solution .",
    "therefore , one can not judge if a set of ir power solutions ( [ dsol ] ) and ( [ gsol ] ) is unique for the coupled sd equations .",
    "the other problem is that all the sd equations aforementioned have been solved in euclidean space .",
    "indeed , the obtained euclidean solutions are very helpful for comparison with the results of numerical simulations on a lattice .",
    "however , one needs to perform analytic continuation in order to go back to the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the analytic continuation to the minkowski region is not necessarily ensured for the euclidean solutions with the asymptotic behaviors ( [ dsol ] ) and ( [ gsol ] ) .    the main purpose of this article is to study the relationship between quark , gluon and ghost propagators in euclidean region and the spectrum of qcd in the minkowski region in connection with color confinement . in this article , we show in yang ",
    "mills theory with the gauge group @xmath8 that the _ analyticity _ of the full propagator on the complex momentum plane plays the role of connecting the perturbative uv asymptotic solution into the non - perturbative ir asymptotic solution and vice versa .",
    "this study resolves the question as to what the ir asymptotic solution with power behavior ( characterized by an exponent @xmath26 ) means for the spectrum with respect to the fundamental fields .",
    "we suggests which type of ir asymptotic solutions should be searched for in the sd equation , while the uv asymptotic solution can be reliably predicted by perturbation theory due to asymptotic freedom . in other words ,",
    "the precise value of @xmath26 will be predicted , if the solution behaves like a power of the momenta .    in this article , we examine two types of manifestly lorentz covariant gauges : first the lorentz gauge in the most general form @xcite , so called the curci ",
    "ferrari gauge , and then the modified version @xcite of the maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite . in the conventional lorentz gauge , all the approximate solutions of the coupled sd equations for the gluon and ghost propagators have been obtained only in the landau gauge .",
    "the sd equation approach in the ma gauge in the same level as the lorentz gauge is still missing in the ma gauge , but see @xcite for a preliminary result .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the generalized lorentz gauge and the modified ma gauge for later convenience . for the above purpose",
    ", we analyze the propagators in the complex @xmath33 ( momentum squared ) plane in section 3 .",
    "we require _ non - perturbative multiplicative renormalizability _ for writing down the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the propagators in the complex @xmath33 plane .",
    "the _ analyticity _ of the propagators except for the positive real axis and the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath34 enables us to specify the ir asymptotic form ( @xmath35 ) such that it can be analytically continued to the uv asymptotic form ( @xmath36 ) calculable by perturbation theory .    in this article",
    ", we investigate which type of ir asymptotic solution of the sd equations is consistent with the general principles of quantized gauge field theories :    1 .",
    "non - perturbative multiplicative renormalizability 2 .",
    "analyticity 3 .",
    "spectral condition ( and completeness ) 4 .",
    "poincar group structure    without relying on the approximate solutions of the sd equation .",
    "the former half of this article is deeply indebted to an idea of old articles by oehme and zimmerman @xcite and subsequent articles by oehme and his collaborator @xcite .",
    "a concept of the superconvergence is crucially important also in this article .",
    "the superconvergence relation is nothing but a sum rule for the spectral function of the _ fundamental field _",
    "propagator which is defined in the minkowski region .",
    "we reconsider anew the relationship between the superconvergence relation and the euclidean propagator , which is to be compared with the solution of the coupled sd equations , paying special attention to the ir asymptotic solution .",
    "we explicitly obtain all the possible superconvergence relations in the generalized lorentz gauge in section 4 and the modified ma gauge in section 7 .",
    "in the generalized lorentz gauge , we show that the superconvergence relation holds for gluon .",
    "consequently , _ the euclidean gluon propagator has the power - series expansion in @xmath14 and goes to a @xmath14-independent constant , i.e. , @xmath37 in the ir limit @xmath20 .",
    "_ therefore , this result suggests that _ the ir exponent @xmath26 characterizing the euclidean solution must take the value @xmath38 irrespective of the value of gauge fixing parameter_.    a question is whether or not the ir asymptotic solution for the ghost propagator exhibits power behavior , just as the recent approximate solution of the truncated sd equation suggests .",
    "so far , one has payed little attention to the superconvergence for ghost .",
    "we claim that _ the superconvergence does not hold for ghost in the pure yang  mills theory ( without dynamical fermions ) _ against the previous result @xcite .",
    "in fact , we elucidate that non - existence of the superconvergence for ghost is consistent with realizing color confinement in qcd . at the same time",
    ", we point out the subtleties of using the landau gauge in the lorentz type gauge fixing , although all the approximate solutions of the coupled sd equations for the gluon and ghost propagators have been obtained only in the landau gauge . in this article",
    "we shall provide a unified view among euclidean solutions of the sd equations , color confinement and the spectrum , especially the mass gap of yang ",
    "mills theory and qcd .    in section 5 , the ir asymptotic form in euclidean region ( @xmath39 : negative real axis )",
    "is related to the spectral property in the minkowski region ( @xmath40 : positive real axis ) by way of the spectral representation which follows from the spectral condition , poincar covariance and completeness of the intermediate states .",
    "we show that _",
    "@xmath41 is consistent with the existence of a massive pole in the gluon propagator in the minkowski region . _",
    "this case implies @xmath30 , the gribov limit .",
    "this possibility can not be excluded from the general considerations only .",
    "however , such a case is realized only when the subtle cancellation occurs between two terms .",
    "the argument in more detail will be given later .",
    "] moreover , we show that , for gluon with massive spectrum , the gluon propagator and the gluon form factor have the well - defined power - series expansions in @xmath14 for small euclidean momenta @xmath14 , suggesting the uniqueness of the ir asymptotic solution with power behavior . in the landau gauge , this result does not contradicts with the existence of the gluon condensate @xmath42 of mass dimension two which has been extensively studied by several groups @xcite , see @xcite for more details on the physical meaning of dimension two condensate .",
    "the gluon condensate @xmath42 is a special limit of the ghost ",
    "gluon condensate of mass dimension 2 which is on - shell brst invariant as proposed in @xcite and calculated recently in @xcite .",
    "in the latter half of this article , we shall focus on the following issues .",
    "for the fp _ ghost propagator _ , however , the analyticity approach alone is not sufficient to provide precise form of the ir asymptotic solution .",
    "this is reasonable for our result to be consistent with the result of sd equation , since the superconvergence for ghost in the landau gauge contradicts with the solution of the sd equations mentioned above , i.e. , enhancement in the ir region . in section 6 , therefore , we make use of the rg equations for the gluon and ghost propagators in the ir region .",
    "first , we point out that the rg equation for the ghost propagator has the ir asymptotic solution with power behavior , if the rg functions in the rg equations have the power series expansion around the ir limit of the coupling constant @xmath43 , see figure  [ fig : rgfunct - pfunct2 ] . here",
    "we use the fact that the gluon propagator has the ir asymptotic solution with power behavior , which follows from the superconvergence argument above , and that the @xmath44 function is common to both rg equations .",
    "thus the power solution @xmath45 for the gluon propagator yields the power solution @xmath46 for the ghost propagator whose ir critical exponent is characterized by the anomalous dimension of the ghost .",
    "next , we must answer how to obtain the exponent @xmath44 in the ir asymptotic solutions for the ghost propagator .",
    "the non - renormalization of the renormalization factor @xmath47 for the gluon  ghost ",
    "antighost vertex in the landau gauge yields the relation @xmath48 , by supposing the existence of an ir fixed point , i.e. , a finite value of @xmath49 , suggested from the solution of the sd equation .",
    "thus the ghost propagator in the landau gauge must behave like @xmath50 in the ir region , provided that @xmath28 .",
    "this result shows that the color confinement criterion due to kugo and ojima @xmath51^{-1 } \\equiv 1+u(0 ) = 0\\ ] ] is fulfilled in the landau gauge yang  mills theory .",
    "these results should be compared with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "an exception to the above argument is the case of the ir attractor , namely the @xmath44 function has a pole . in this case , we have not yet found the consistent solution .    in section 7",
    ", we analyze the modified ma gauge .",
    "the ma gauge looks quite different reflecting a fact that the propagators are gauge dependent quantities .",
    "we show that the off - diagonal gluon and off - diagonal ghost propagators converge to @xmath14-independent constants in the ir limit .",
    "this implies that the off - diagonal modes become massive as is expected from the abelian dominance @xcite .",
    "the abelian dominance was predicted in @xcite and subsequently confirmed by numerical simulations on a lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "independent analytical investigations suggest that the vacuum condensates of mass dimension 2 may be an origin of dynamical mass generation for off - diagonal modes , see @xcite for the brst non - invariant ghost condensate and @xcite for the brst - invariant gluon  ghost condensate",
    ". however , the precise relationship between the condensate and the ir asymptotic behavior is not yet fully understood .",
    "a remarkable result in this article is that the diagonal gluon propagator can be of massive type and that only the diagonal ghost propagator can be short - range , since only the diagonal ghost does not obey superconvergence .",
    "the implication of this result to color confinement will be discussed in this article .",
    "our results can be compared with the recent numerical results @xcite .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "some of the details of the calculations are given in appendix a.",
    "in this section we introduce the generalized lorentz gauge and the modified maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge which are used in this article for fixing the gauge of the @xmath8 yang  mills theory .",
