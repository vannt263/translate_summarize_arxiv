    "in general numerical simulations of the dynamics of soliton solutions in particle physics are of fundamental interest to test their stability .",
    "specifically the dynamics of einstein - yang - mills systems help to understand the interplay of gravity and non - abelian gauge fields . as analytical solutions for the fully nonlinear equations are usually not available in these cases , only numerical simulations can provide further insight .",
    "bartnik and mckinnon @xcite found that particle - like solutions for the einstein - yang - mills system exist , while that is not the case for either pure yang - mills or the pure einstein systems @xcite .",
    "volkov et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the einstein - yang - mills equations with cosmological constant @xmath2 to find an analogous class of solutions .    in @xcite brodbeck et al .",
    "performed the respective stability analysis of these static bartnick - mckinnon analogues .",
    "first steps in simulating the dynamical evolution of the the ground state @xmath0 in the case of @xmath1 has been taken in @xcite .",
    "different to the approach of @xcite we use a finite element scheme for our numerical simulations and a reformulated differential equation .",
    "special emphasis is on the boundary conditions in relation of the conservation of energy . in our approach",
    "we consider the static de sitter manifold only .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : eq ] we discuss the physical field equation that governs the dynamics of the monopole . in section  [ sec : bnd ]",
    "we derive the initial- and boundary conditions in relation to the particle energy .",
    "the discretisation and related stability issues are discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "finally numerical results are given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "in their analysis of einstein - yang - mills fields with a cosmological constant volkov et al .",
    "@xcite found that three different classes of solutions exist .",
    "these are static , spherically symmetric and are characterized by their value of @xmath2 and the number of nodes @xmath3 .",
    "the three different classes can be distinguished by their values of @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath4 the solutions approach asymptotically the de sitter geometry .",
    "the solutions with @xmath5 are the so called `` bag of gold solutions '' .",
    "they have finite size , but still an horizon .",
    "all the solutions with non - vanishing @xmath6 have non - vanishing magnetic charge . at @xmath7",
    "the solutions are compact solutions on a de sitter manifold , where magnetic charges are no longer defined .",
    "the smooth , spherically symmetric yang - mills field has a su(2 ) gauge group .",
    "the components of the gauge field in spherical coordinates for the abelian gauge are    @xmath8    [ feq ]    where @xmath9 is the coupling constant of the yang - mills ( ym ) field and the @xmath10 are the generators of the su(2 ) group , @xmath11 being the pauli matrices .",
    "this gauge has been chosen as the yang - mills field in this case only depends on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which reflects the spherical symmetry of the field .",
    "the de sitter manifold is defined by its metric . in conformal",

    "its curvature is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath2 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the field equations can be derived through using the variational principle on the appropriate lagrangian .",

    "the equations for the coupled einstein - yang - mills system have been derived in @xcite , as well as the equations for the decoupled yang - mills field on a static de sitter manifold @xmath24 here the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and prime the derivative with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "this is a semi - linear partial differential equation of hyperbolic type .",
    "in this paper we investigate the numerical solution of equation .",
    "it is defined on the compact domain @xmath25_{(\\mathbb{r } } , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and requires initial conditions for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for the initial conditions for @xmath26 we will chose the stationary solution given in equation , for the initial conditions for @xmath27",
    "we introduce a perturbation of the stationary system .",
    "boundary conditions follow from energy considerations , see below .      as we have already mentioned before we are analysing the dynamical evolution of the static bartnik - mckinnon analogue with @xmath0 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is given by @xmath29 thus it represents our initial condition for @xmath26 . in the following we set the coupling constant @xmath30 . as the initial condition for  @xmath27",
    "we choose @xmath31 with an arbitrary function @xmath32 , which was chosen in different numerical experiments differently .",
    "the boundary conditions for the system will be derived from the finiteness of the energy . for systems on a minkowski space - times , these types of boundary conditions are related to the asymptotic behavior of the field at infinity .",
    "these conditions are implemented by an appropriate choice of the functions - space , e.g. @xmath33 , etc . as for the minkowski space - times",
    ", for the compact de sitter manifold the energy finiteness of @xmath26 will be related to an appropriate choice of the function space .      as we are investigating a spherical symmetric yang - mills field",
    "the energy is independent of these variables .      in @xcite chrusciel et al .",
    "derived a priori estimates of the solution space of yang - mills equations on globally hyperbolic four dimensional lorentz manifolds .",
    "they show that the yang - mills gauge field @xmath36 belongs to the sobolev space @xmath37 with @xmath38 and an appropriate constant @xmath39 . from the assumed symmetry ( @xmath36 is independent of @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and",
    "it follows @xmath40 with @xmath41 the energy of the yang - mills field in the decoupled case is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43is the energy momentum tensor and @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the normal of the domain pointing outside and a killing vector respectively . with the constant of proportionality @xmath46 we rewrite the energy as @xmath47 due to the continuity of @xmath48 with respect to @xmath12 , the finiteness of @xmath49 implies @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath53 assuming the boundary conditions and a field @xmath48 governed by equation , it is easily varified that the energy is conserved at all times . with it",
    "follows @xmath54 as for the initial condition , we assume vanishing spatial derivatives of the solution at @xmath55 for all times .",
    "this follows from the assumption that the solution should describe a smooth solution on the three - dimensional sphere requiring tangential planes at the poles corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "we therefore make the ansatz @xmath56 with the unknown function @xmath57 . from",
    "follows the equation for @xmath58 @xmath59 with the boundary and initial conditions @xmath60 the following two terms in equation need special attention : the scaling factor of dalembert operator ( @xmath61 vanishes at the boundary @xmath55 and the source term linear in @xmath58 has infinite weights at the boundaries .",
    "the first difficulty is in view of a non - vanishing source at the boundary unproblematic .",
    "assuming the same regularity for @xmath58 as we have for @xmath26 , i.e. @xmath62 , the linearly diverging weight of the linear source term is also not problematic .",
    "to integrate forwards in time , we transformed the equation to a set of first order equations , which we integrate by two different implicit schemes .",
    "the first is the classical implicit euler methods , the second a modification of a two - stage runge - kutta method ( alexander scheme)@xcite , first introduced by in @xcite .    for the discretisation of the spatial dimension we chose the conforming finite element discretisation with continuous , piece - wise linear basis functions .",
    "we used a equidistant grid with mesh - size @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "the spatial integrals have been carried out with _",
    "maple _ with the exception of the fourth term in equation .",
    "this term can not be integrated analytically and has been treated by appropriate integration rules ( simpson rule ) .",
    "the numerical approximation of these integrals has been investigated and chosen appropriately to avoid numerical artifacts .",
    "additionally it was necessary to use taylor expansions for the sine and cosine terms in the discretisation of the two non - linear terms in f. as an illustration for this issue we discuss the term cubic in f. its discretisation is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the @xmath67 scalar product , @xmath68 and @xmath69 denote the piecewise linear basis functions .",
