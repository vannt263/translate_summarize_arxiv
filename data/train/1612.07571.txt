    "the study of the role of electronic correlations in transition metal compounds is one of the most actively developing fields of modern condensed matter physics .",
    "this class of materials exhibits rich and highly nontrivial physical phenomena such as unconventional transport properties including metal - insulator transitions , bad metal behavior or superconductivity , or ordering phenomena involving charge , orbital or spin degrees of freedom .",
    "it is by now clear that most of these properties arise due to electronic correlations , in particular strong coulomb interactions among the partially occupied 3@xmath1 electrons of the metal ion .    among these oxides ,",
    "nio is a prototype system for strong electronic correlations with a high spin antiferromagnetic structure at low temperatures  @xcite . the exact origin , nature and size of the fundamental gap and , more broadly ,",
    "the electronic structure of nio , has been studied intensely for many years , and is also a major topic of text books on condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "initially nio was thought to be a classic mott insulating system  @xcite with a large insulating gap .",
    "however , later studies  @xcite suggested that the gap might open between states of oxygen @xmath2 character and empty @xmath1 states , classifying nio as a charge - transfer insulator . over the years a vast number of experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies have been carried out aiming at a clearer understanding of the electronic structure and magnetism of this system .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest also in understanding the properties of nio under pressure  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a pressure - driven mott insulator - to - metal transition ( imt ) was anticipated by mott _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite a long time ago , but the compression ration and the corresponding transition pressure @xmath5 were subjects of debate  @xcite .",
    "the density functional theory calculations using perdew - wang generalized gradient approximation ( pwgga ) functional  @xcite predict the transition to occur at about 40@xmath6 volume compression [ ( v0-v)/v0 ] , while a calculation using hybrid functional b3lyp  @xcite estimates it to be 65@xmath6 .",
    "these volumes compression correspond to the critical pressure of transition p@xmath7 @xmath8 320 gpa and @xmath8 1320 gpa respectively according to their calculated equations of state  @xcite which has been found to be very similar for both the functionals and is also in good agreement with the experimental report of ref .  .",
    "the first experimental observation of the transition  @xcite finally came in 2012 , at a transition pressure of 240 gpa .",
    "this transition pressure was also calculated based on the above mentioned theoretically calculated equation of state  @xcite and it corresponds to 35@xmath6 volume compression .",
    "on the theoretical side  @xcite , it is now well established that neither the conventional effective single - particle band theory within local ( spin ) density approximation ( l(s)da ) , nor the l(s)da+u method in which l(s)da is augmented by an on - site coulomb repulsion term and an exchange term with the hubbard @xmath0 and hund exchange @xmath9 parameters , respectively can provide an accurate description of the electronic properties of nio .",
    "hedin s gw approximation  @xcite provides an interesting route to the antiferromagnetic insulating phase  @xcite but can not describe the paramagnetic insulator  .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of the correlation effects within a fully many - body technique like lda plus dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft )  @xcite is inevitable to describe the nonquasiparticle features of the electronic spectrum of nio .",
    "even then , nio turns out to be a tremendous challenge , due to its charge transfer character  @xcite . in the lda+dmft method ,",
    "the noninteracting part of the hamiltonian , obtained from lda involving a large number of valence @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 orbitals associated with all the atoms in the unit cell is expressed in an effective @xmath1-like wannier basis in order to construct an effective multiband hubbard model which is solved by dmft .",
    "the interaction term for this hamiltonian is the effective interaction between the wannier orbitals which is again incorporated by a hubbard @xmath0 and hund exchange @xmath9 parameter .",
    "the lda+dmft simulations of nio reported so far  @xcite considered @xmath0 as an adjustable parameter to correctly reproduce the experimentally reported x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) or / and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy ( bis ) spectra  @xcite .",
    "the different values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 , used in these studies are tabulated in table  [ uj_reported ] .",
    "values of @xmath0 ranging from 7.0 ev to 10 ev have been considered .",
    "however there exists a first - principles method , the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa )  @xcite which has been recently successfully employed to evaluate the screened coulomb interaction matrix elements ( @xmath0 an @xmath9 ) between the effective wannier functions in many transition metal compounds  @xcite , including a study of mno under pressure @xcite .",
    "this method  @xcite is capable of efficiently determining all the possible coulomb matrix elements , e.g. , on site , off site , intraorbital , interorbital , and exchange , as well as their frequency dependence  @xcite .    despite enormous work on nio ,",
    "the detailed investigation of the coulomb interaction parameters within the crpa approach is limited so far .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported matrix elements of the partially screened interactions including their frequency dependence using various low energy models and discussed the sensitivity of these parameters with respect to the chosen low energy model  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite used nio to benchmark the performance of a variant of the crpa scheme dubbed `` shell - folding '' , which incorporates the screening by @xmath11-interactions into effective @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath2 interactions .",
    "however , none of these works addressed the important question of how the effective interactions evolve under pressure .",
    "the effects of external pressure on these very important parameters ( @xmath0 and @xmath9 ) of nio , a most enigmatic strongly correlated material that has been of interest since the days of mott and hubbard , has not been analyzed so far .",
    "a very recent theoretical study  @xcite based on the state - of - the - art fully charge self - consistent dft+dmft method found the mott imt transition to coincide with a magnetic - to - nonmagnetic collapse transition at about 45@xmath6 volume compression which corresponds to a critical pressure of 429 gpa according to their calculated equation of state .",
    "this study  @xcite considered the value of @xmath0 and @xmath9 as high as 10 ev and 1 ev respectively and assumed those parameters to remain constant upon variation of the unit cell volume .",
    "however the effective @xmath0 in transition metal compounds may be strongly dependent on pressure as has been emphasized in several previous works  @xcite .",
    "the practice of considering @xmath0 as a nearly pressure independent parameter may thus bias the results altogether .",
    "therefore a quantitative estimation of the interactions parameters under pressure is particularly important for a material as important as nio whose behavior is primarily dominated by the strong coulomb interactions .",
    ".the value of @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( in ev ) used in different reported lda+dmft studies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ uv_afm ]      in all of the reported lda+dmft simulations  @xcite , the interactions parameters are considered somewhat different than those calculated within crpa including the estimated values of this work .",
    "it has been found that a large value of @xmath0 is required to reproduce the experimental band gap as well as to obtain the satellite feature ( lower hubbard band ) at the correct binding energy .",
    "this fact still remains an unsolved puzzle . in this context the frequency dependence of @xmath0 may provide a useful insight . with this in mind , in order to understand the necessity of using frequency dependence of @xmath0 for the experimental and high pressure structures in a realistic many - body model hamiltonian , we have first compared the computed real and imaginary components of averaged @xmath12 for the experimental structure among various low energy models in figs .",
    "[ frequexp](a ) and ( b ) respectively . in the case of @xmath3-@xmath3 model , the real part of @xmath12",
    "is found to be almost constant in the low frequency region upto around 10 ev .",
    "this might suggests that the use of the static limit in this model is better justified than in the other setups .",
    "this is also expected since no internal transition within the ni-@xmath13 and o-@xmath14 states is allowed in this model and the polarization involving the higher lying ni-@xmath15 , @xmath16 states are responsible for the first prominent peak which appears around 16 ev . however , since this model should of course describe the same physical situation as in the other models , it is clear that in the @xmath3-@xmath3 model the neglect of non - local ( and intershell @xmath1-@xmath2 ) interactions is a much more drastic approximation .",
    "making @xmath0 frequency - dependent , appears to be a way to incorporate nonlocal screening processes in an effective local description .",
    "indeed , in all the other models real parts of @xmath12 show a strong variation at low frequencies and correspondingly we also see sharp peaks in their respective imaginary parts , suggesting the failure of static limit .",
    "in the @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath1-@xmath3 model , the first peak in the imaginary parts of @xmath12 appear around 8 ev which is originated from the polarization involving @xmath1-@xmath2 transitions .",
    "since the origin of the higher energy peaks in these models are exactly same to the @xmath3-@xmath3 model , all the other peaks coincide with the peaks of @xmath3-@xmath3 model as expected .",
    "the variation of the real part of @xmath0 at low @xmath17 become strongest in the @xmath4-@xmath3 and @xmath4-@xmath4 models , introducing an additional peak at around 2.6 ev in the imaginary part of @xmath0 .",
    "this comes from the polarization involving transition between @xmath18 and @xmath4 states .",
    "we also observe that a crossover from the low - energy screened regime to the high - energy tail takes place at around 23 ev which can be assigned to a plasma excitation . in order to provide credence to our results of @xmath12 , the experimental electron energy loss spectra ( eels ) , adopted from ref .",
    "has been shown in fig .",
    "[ frequexp](c ) .",
    "the eels data of ref .",
    "display a well - defined plasmon excitation at 22 ev , providing a very good agreement with our calculated results which is observed around 23 ev ( feature ii ) .",
    "the other sharp feature ( marked as i ) at around 8 ev also agrees perfectly with the experimental eels data .",
    "this further validates the use of lda electronic structure for calculating the effective @xmath12 and most importantly justifies the accuracy of our estimations .",
    "we note that in addition to the two sharp characteristic features of eels data ( feature i and ii ) , our computed results also find several other important features at low as well as in high frequency regions .",
    "next we analyze the frequency dependence of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 and their pressure dependence within @xmath3-@xmath3 model in fig .",
    "[ frequdp](a)-(c ) .",
    "we observe that the overall shapes of the @xmath12 are very similar for all the interactions , however the intensities of the peaks are different .",
    "this is expected since the number of free electrons involved in the corresponding polarization are different .",
    "we observe that compression of the lattice volume does not change the overall nature of the frequency dependence but shift the peak positions towards higher energy .",
    "we also notice that the frequency variations of @xmath21 weaken with increasing pressure and almost become constant at the highest pressure of our study .",
    "finally we discuss the pressure dependence of @xmath12 for the other models in fig .",
    "[ frequ](a)-(d ) .",
    "again we find that the peak positions are shifted toward higher energy keeping the overall shape of the @xmath12 intact .",
    "this can be understood from the evolution of the basic electronic structure due to the application of pressure . as discussed in sec.iii(a ) , pressure enhances the crystal field splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath4 states as well as the @xmath1-@xmath2 energy differences , and therefore the peaks , arising due to the transitions between these states also gradually shift toward higher energy as a function of volume compression .      in order to understand the robustness of the computed interaction parameters , we have carried out crpa calculations for the antiferromagnetic nio",
    "the computed dos and projected pdos of antiferromagnetic phase for the experimental structure and compressed structure are displayed in fig .",
    "[ dos_sp](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "as we can see , similar to the non - spin polarized phase , pressure induces an increase in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bandwidths and their separations .",
    "in agreement with the earlier studies , our calculation within lsda approach also obtained a gaped solution for the experimental structure .",
    "however system becomes gapless upon compression .",
    "for both the structures , we have also compared the total antiferromagnetic dos with its nonmagnetic counter part as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ dos_sp](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "our results indicate that although there is very little change in the bandwidth upon spin - polarization for the experimental structure , but antiferromagnetic ordering is responsible for opening up the gap at the fermi level [ see inset of fig .",
    "[ dos_sp](a ) ] . owing to the fact that compression also tends to suppress the magnetism ,",
    "the total antiferromagnetic dos in the high pressure phase is almost identical to the nonmagnetic total dos [ see fig .  [ dos_sp](b ) ] .",
    "these features provide an indication that the interaction parameters are likely not to be very different in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the averaged bare and partially screened interaction parameters are shown in table  [ uv_afm ] for the antiferromagnetic phase as well as the non - spin polarized phase .",
    "interestingly the bare and effective values of @xmath0 for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbitals are almost equal in both the phases as was indicated from the analysis of the electronic structure .",
    "this further reveals that neither the spreads of the wannier function , nor the screenings are sensitive to the spin - polarization , establishing the robustness of the quantitative accuracy of our obtained results for the paramagnetic nio as discussed in this article .",
    "in summary we have studied the bare and screened coulomb interactions parameters of nio under pressure using the crpa method .",
    "compression induces little changes in the bare coulomb interactions , indicating only slight modification in the associated wannier functions , while it gives rise to an enhancement of the effective screened interactions .",
    "a detailed analysis of the electronic structure reveals that the compression causes a very large separation between the ni-@xmath1 and o-@xmath2 states , resulting  at the rpa level  in a poor screening that leads to this counterintuitive trend of the effective interaction parameters .",
    "in contrast , the growth with pressure of the inter - site interactions is primarily governed by a similar enhancement of the corresponding bare interactions .",
    "we analyzed the frequency dependence of the effective screened interactions for the experimental equilibrium as well as compressed structures and concluded that it can not be ignored in a complete description of the electronic structure of nio .",
    "thus it will be interesting to investigate the renormalization of the ni-@xmath1 states within a many - body calculation with frequency dependent @xmath0 , and analyze satellite structures beyond a description with static @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we have detected a striking similarity in the interaction values between calculations assuming antiferromagnetic and non - magnetic behavior respectively , despite the quite different description of the low - energy states .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy results  and in particular the close similarity of spectra taken in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases  can be interpreted as suggesting that the antiferromagnetic phase might eventually be a more faithful representation even of paramagnetic nio . in this sense , the agreement of the interaction values in the two calculations is encouraging , questioning the need for further self - consistency .",
