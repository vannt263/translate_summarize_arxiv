    "the enhancement and suppression of dissociation processes @xcite and chemical reactions @xcite by lasers have been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "many of the proposed schemes are based on the modification of molecular potentials by the radiation field .",
    "the new ( `` dressed '' ) potentials may open pathways for reaction , which were previously closed , thereby completely altering the radiation - free course of events .",
    "the details of these light - induced potentials depend on the laser parameters ( frequency , intensity , and pulse - shape ) , which may therefore be used to control the reaction yield .",
    "one approach for the acceleration of exchange reactions uses the interaction of ir radiation fields with the permanent @xcite or field - induced @xcite dipole moment of an a+bc system , which varies as the system crosses the reactive region .",
    "thus , reaction barriers are traversed on the _ ground _ electronic potential , even when the reactants are ir inactive and the laser frequency is far from resonance @xcite . however , due to the rather weak dipole moments involved ( e.g. in the order of 0.05 a.u . for the h+h@xmath0 system @xcite ) , the interaction of the reacting system with the radiation becomes significant only when the laser power is in the order of tw/@xmath1 . at these intensities ,",
    "nonresonant strong field processes such as multiphoton dissociation and even more prominently , multiphoton ionization take over , thereby drastically reducing the reaction yield .    in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "it was was proposed to employ the resonant excitation of _ electronic _ transitions by optical or uv radiation , thereby allowing reactants to cross the ground state reaction barrier @xcite .",
    "the laser in this case couples to electronic transition dipoles which are orders of magnitude stronger than the dipole moment of the ground state .",
    "earlier implementations involved the free - free coupling of scattering states on the ground and excited electronic potentials @xcite .",
    "power requirements for these schemes are still high because the transition dipole moments are greatly reduced due to the rapidly oscillating nuclear wavefunctions .",
    "moreover , once a transition to the excited electronic potential takes place , the reaction would inevitably proceed on that surface , the net result being the excitation of an electronic transition and the absorption of a photon .",
    "`` laser catalysis '' @xcite was devised as a refinement of the free - free electronic excitation schemes .",
    "when , as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , the excited electronic surface has a minimum located above the ground state potential barrier ( i.e. there exists a stable electronically excited trimer abc@xmath2 ) , exchange reactions taking place on the ground electronic surface may be enhanced or suppressed by transient excitation to a _ bound _ molecular state .",
    "the stronger dipole moments for the free - bound transition ensure that power requirements are relaxed .",
    "moreover , because the excited state is bound , the excited reagents are trapped in the transition state region and shuttle freely from the reactants rearrangement channel to the products channel .",
    "seminal proposals for laser catalysis involved a cw source of optical / uv radiation , coupling the ground and excited electronic potentials @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations for the cw laser catalysis of the h+h@xmath0 reaction @xcite indicated that the power requirement for the process is in the order of 100 mw/@xmath1 .",
    "this was both good and bad news .",
    "good , because the above power is sufficiently low to avoid any parasitic strong field effects and bad , because unfortunately , at the current state of laser technology , such intense cw sources are not in supply . nevertheless , _",
    "pulsed _ lasers could easily accommodate the above power demand .",
    "it was therefore clear that in order to facilitate an experimental implementation of the technique , schemes for _ pulsed laser catalysis _ should be devised .",
    "the dressed state methodology of the cw laser catalysis studies @xcite can not account for the use of pulses .",
    "a new theoretical machinery was required in order to check whether the cw results would hold for the pulsed process .",
    "therefore we have developed a time - dependent theory of pulsed laser catalysis @xcite , which builds on a previous formalism for photodissociation @xcite and photoassociation @xcite . in this article , we review the detailed calculations of pulsed laser catalysis on one- @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite electronic potential surfaces . our results accurately reproduce all the features of cw laser catalysis and may well open the way to an experimental demonstration of the process .",
    "the laser catalysis scheme is outlined in fig .",
    "1 . consider an @xmath3 exchange reaction , described by a smooth potential barrier along the reaction coordinate of the ground electronic surface .",
    "the collisions of @xmath4 atoms with @xmath5 molecules are described by the outgoing scattering states @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "1 , solid arrows ) , corresponding to a flux originating in the reactants ( @xmath7 ) rearrangement channel and impinging on the barrier from the right .",
    "we assume that the collision energy is not sufficient to classically overcome the activation potential .",
    "therefore , only a fraction of all collisions taking place without radiative assistance , given by the quantum tunneling probability through the barrier , would be reactive .",
    "the effect of a laser pulse of frequency @xmath8 , assumed to be in near - resonance with the transition to an intermediate ground state @xmath9 , is to open another pathway into the products ( @xmath10 ) rearrangement channel .",
    "thus , population is transferred from states @xmath6 to states @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "1 , dashed arrows ) , with the final aim that the entire wavefunction would be localized in the products channel ( catalysis ) or in the reactants channel ( suppression ) at the end of the process .",
    "snapshots of the nonradiative reactive scattering process on a potential surface resembling the ground electronic potential of the collinear h+h@xmath0 reaction @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "the simulation is performed at an incident energy of 8.8 kcal / mol , compared with an activation energy of approximately 9.8 kcal / mol . as can be seen , the reaction probability at this energy is negligible .",
    "the wavepacket arrives at the barrier region , only to be reflected back into the @xmath7 rearrangement channel , with less than 1% reaction yield .",
    "however , when the laser pulse is turned on , we observe a complete population transfer to the @xmath10 products channel , as depicted in fig .",
    "3 . the resulting radiative reaction yield is greater than 99% .",
    "note that throughout the process there is hardly any loss of flux to the excited state @xmath9 .",
    "this is important because even a transient accumulation of population in the excited state may expose the process to spontaneous emission losses , and thereby compromise the scheme s efficiency .",
    "a wavepacket approaching the barrier of fig",
    ". 1 in the reactants channel may either nonradiatively tunnel through it , or radiatively `` hop '' above it .",
    "the existence of two possible pathways across the activation barrier suggests that interesting interference effects may be observed between them .",
    "we note that a similar situation causes the fano resonances @xcite of autoionization , predissociation and laser induced continuum structure ( lics ) . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the reaction probability of a one - dimensional laser catalysis process @xcite , as a function of the pulse carrier frequency , at three pulse intensities .",
    "the nonradiative reaction probability , corresponding to a far off - resonant laser frequency , is about 9% .",
    "the obtained reactive lineshape has an asymmetric fano - type profile , i.e. the reaction is enhanced for a blue - detuned pulse and suppressed for a red - detuned pulse .",
    "moreover , there exists a positive detuning value , for which the transmission coefficient is nearly unity , and a negative detuning value , for which the transmission coefficient is nearly zero .",
    "this interference phenomenon stems from the existence of two sources for the population in the products channel : the nonradiatively transmitted wavepacket of @xmath6 states and a second , radiatively transmitted packet of @xmath11 states .",
    "these two packets interfere either constructively or destructively , depending on the sign of the laser detuning , thereby leading to yield enhancement or suppression , respectively . increasing the intensity of the catalizing laser",
    "has the effect of strengthening the radiative path with respect to the intensity - independent nonradiative process , thereby radiatively broadening the reactive line .",
    "great insight into the laser catalysis mechanism is gained by adopting the `` ( photon ) dressed states '' picture , in which we consider the optically - induced molecular potential surfaces .",
    "these are obtained by diagonalization of the @xmath12 dressed potential matrix , comprising the ( diagonal ) dressed potentials and the ( off - diagonal ) field - dipole coupling term .",
    "the resulting two field - matter eigenvalues are plotted in fig .",
    "5 . due to the existence of two avoided crossing points of the diabatic potential curves , the ground field - matter eigenvalue has the shape of a double - barrier potential and the first excited eigenvalue has a double - well profile .",
    "the separation between these curves gets larger as the coupling field strength is increased .",
    "thus , particles approaching the transition state region are resonantly scattered by a double - barrier potential .",
    "when the incident energy is near a quasibound state of the well between the barriers , perfect transmission is admitted , regardless of the potential details @xcite .",
    "thus , the resonances observed in the laser catalysis lineshapes originate from the same mechanism that produces the resonant modes of semiconductor devices @xcite and fabry - prot interferometers @xcite .",
    "the same mechanism was recently used to devise a continuum version @xcite of the schemes for coherent enhancement and destruction of tunneling by an intense off - resonant driving field @xcite .",
    "our studies of one - dimensional @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite laser catalysis indicate that experimental verification of the predicted effects may be carried out using commercially available pulsed laser sources .",
    "nevertheless , further work is required in order to go beyond collinear reactive scattering on symmetric surfaces .",
    "a much desired feature of our formalism in this respect , is that it neatly separates the laser parameters ( i.e. frequency , detuning , and pulse - duration ) from the material part of the problem ( i.e. the electronic transition dipole moments , determined by the overlap of molecular wavefunctions ) .",
    "thus , all we need for a full , three - dimensional calculation of any particular laser catalysis scenario , are the molecular transition dipole moments for that reaction .",
    "such transition matrix elements were calculated for the 3d h+h@xmath0 reaction @xcite , making it an obvious next step .",
    "reliable electronic potential surfaces exist also for the asymmetric f+h@xmath0 reaction @xcite and for several mxh systems ( m and x being an alkali atom and a halogen atom , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "laser catalysis of these reactions is particularly attractive from an experimental point of view , because the reactants and the products are easily distinguishable . in selecting a suitable candidate",
    ", one should ascertain that : ( a ) the potential barrier is sufficiently high to prohibit thermal activation , ( b ) there exists an excited potential well , ( c ) the radiative transitions are strongly allowed , and ( d ) there are pulsed laser sources able to provide the required wavelength .",
    "we expect the first experiments to be carried out at low collision energies , where the nonradiative transmission amplitudes are vanishingly small , and consequently , the nonradiative background is negligible .",
    "while the original formulation of laser catalysis involves the acceleration of atom - diatom exchange reactions , possible implementation need not be limited to this field .",
    "the strong frequency dependence of the total transmission probability , manifested in the narrow resonance lines , may be the basis for the construction of effective optical gates .",
    "the same effect could be used for the production of narrow velocity filters , including an atomic fabry - perot interferometer @xcite , based on laser - assisted tunneling through optically induced potentials .",
    "another attractive application is the laser control of tunneling through individual atoms in low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) junctions @xcite , which may lead to a new form of single atom spectroscopy and open the way for the construction of atomic scale electro - optical devices .",
    "in conclusion , our results verify the viability of pulsed laser catalysis .",
    "all the qualitative features of the cw process @xcite which was deemed impractical due to its high power demand , were reproduced .",
    "the power demands of the pulsed process are easily satisfied by commercially available sources , finally making an experimental demonstration possible .",
    "our formalism facilitates a relatively easy treatment of different exchange reactions .",
    "the detailed calculation of any particular reaction requires only the relevant transition dipole moments , which need be calculated only once for all pulse parameters .",
    "possible implementations in solid - state devices , atom optics , and scanning tunneling microscopy , go beyond the acceleration and suppression of chemical reactions .",
