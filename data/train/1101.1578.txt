    "the exotic superconducting state called larkin - ovchinikov - fulde - ferrel ( loff ) state has been proposed to arise in superconductors under a strong magnetic field.@xcite the loff state has a spatially varying order parameter associated with cooper pairs with finite center - of - mass momentum . if a strong magnetic field induces spin polarization , such cooper pairs are considered to form between electrons with different fermi momenta .",
    "the loff state is also relevant for the physics of color superconductivity where quarks with different masses form pairs.@xcite this state was not observed for over 40 years since its proposal , in spite of tremendous efforts . in the last couple of years , there have been several claims of its observation in heavy fermion materials @xcite and organic superconductors @xcite , but direct confirmation is yet to be given ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "recent developments of research in cold atomic fermi gases have renewed interest in the loff state ( see ref .   for a review ) . in two component fermi gases consisting of atoms in two different hyperfine states ,",
    "( pseudo-)spin polarization can be controlled by changing the populations of the two components.@xcite furthermore , atomic interaction can be tuned in this system by using the feshbach resonance which allows one to explore the interesting bcs - bec crossover physics .",
    "thus , a spin polarized fermi gas is an ideal system for realizing and exploring the loff state . in fermi gases in a toroidal trap",
    ", it has been shown that a new state called angular loff state is possible in which the rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken,@xcite instead of the translational symmetry for the usual loff state .",
    "recently , observation of spin polarized superfluid state was reported @xcite and it is expected that the loff state has been achieved in this experiment",
    ". however , direct observation of its oscillating order parameter is still lacking .",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation has been widely employed to study the loff state .",
    "machida and nakanishi @xcite derived the self - consistent loff state solution of the 1d bdg equation making use of the analytical solutions of the 1d peierls problem.@xcite however , they assume that electrons with up and down spins have the same fermi velocities ( @xmath0 ) , so that their loff solutions are valid only when spin polarization is small .",
    "this assumption is appropriate to superconducting states , because in ordinary superconductors the splitting of the fermi surfaces is of an order of the pair potential at the pauli limit , which is much smaller than the radius of the fermi surfaces.@xcite on the other hand , the fermi surface mismatch is in general not small for cold atomic fermi gases @xcite and therefore we have to take into account large spin polarization .",
    "the spin imbalance effect was previously studied in the peierls problem.@xcite    recently a new approach for solving the bdg equation has been proposed by baar and dunne.@xcite they derived the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) for the order parameter @xmath1 with a suitable ansatz for gorkov green s function . since the derived nlse is a closed equation for the order parameter @xmath2 , this enables one to avoid the self - consistent calculation of the coupled equations of the bdg equation and the gap equation . using this approach",
    ", they found a new self - consistent solution for a complex kink crystal , which includes all previously known solutions as special cases , such as the solutions of the loff state ( real kink crystal ) @xcite and shei s complex ( twisted ) kink @xcite .",
    "this new approach and the complex kink crystal solution have been further developed @xcite for the massless gross - neveu model @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio model in @xmath3 dimension .",
    "@xcite however , this approach has not been extended to spin polarized system .    in this paper , we investigate the self - consistent solutions of the bdg equation for spin _ imbalanced _ fermi condensates .",
    "we extend the approach developed by baar and dunne to obtain the analytic solutions for the loff state in which the order parameter exhibits spatial oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the solutions of machida and nakanishi , we take into account the difference in the fermi velocities ( @xmath4 ) and derive the exact solutions for the condensate @xmath2 which are valid for _ any _ spin polarizations .",
    "we show how the effect of large spin polarization changes the form of the non - linear schrdinger equation for the order parameter .",
    "we also develop the perturbation theory for the bdg equation in the presence of small spin polarization , and obtain the fermion zero mode which is exact for arbitrary spin polarization .",
    "in this section , we derive the nonlinear schrdinger equation for the order parameter @xmath1 in the presence of spin polarization .",
    "we consider a gas of fermions with spin up and down in quasi - one dimension under a magnetic field . if fermions with different spins interact attractively , the system undergoes a superconducting ( superfluid ) transition at low temperature . although the mean field approximation is not valid in strict one dimension , since we assume a quasi - one dimensional system relevant for experiments , the system can be described by the mean - field bdg equation @xcite ( we set @xmath5 ) @xmath6 \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } u_0(x ) \\\\",
