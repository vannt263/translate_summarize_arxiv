    "molecular clouds are expected to form in the coldest gas which , due to its higher number density , can more efficiently shield from dissociating photons than warm gas . indeed , in the milky way and beyond , mcs are commonly observed to be associated with regions of high - column - density @xmath0  ( e.g. , wannier et al .",

    "such observations suggest that @xmath0  is a necessary ingredient for mc formation .",
    "on the other hand , perhaps @xmath0  envelopes result from the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen , @xmath6  ( e.g. , allen et al . 2004 ; heiner et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it is also possible that such @xmath0  envelopes result from a combination of mc formation and evolution processes .",
    "either way , these interpretations highlight the importance of understanding the function of atomic gas in mcs and stellar evolution .",
    "the various roles @xmath0  may play in mc evolution have been studied from theoretical and observational standpoints .",
    "first , some cold atomic clouds provide sufficient shielding against dissociation by the ultraviolet ( uv ) interstellar radiation field that molecular gas can form in their interiors .",
    "the structure of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , where the transition from atomic to molecular gas occurs , has been treated theoretically by authors including van dishoeck & black ( 1986 ) , hollenbach & tielens ( 1997 ) , draine & bertoldi ( 1996 ) , browning et al .",

    "( 2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "the latter investigated the pdr around a spherical cloud of solar metallicity , and estimated that a minimum surface density of @xmath8 is required for @xmath6  formation .",
    "moreover , goldbaum et al .",
    "( 2011 ) noted that higher initial surface densities of @xmath0  envelopes may result in higher mass mcs .",
    "second , mcs may continue to accrete atomic gas for an extended period during and their formation ( e.g. , chieze & pineau des forets 1989 ; hennebelle & inutsuka 2006 ; vzquez - semadeni et al .",

    "( 2010 ) demonstrated that while stellar feedback and accretion of atomic gas compete in regulating the mass of mc , accretion can be the deciding factor in the total mass of mcs .",
    "also , accretion of atomic gas may shape the dynamics of mcs by maintaining turbulence ( chieze & pineau des forets 1989 ; hennebelle & inutsuka 2006 ; goldbaum et al .",

    ", a great deal of attention has been paid to evaluating the pdfs derived from column density maps of mcs from dust extinction observations ( e.g. , lombardi et al . 2006 ; 2008 ; 2011 ; kainulainen et al . 2009 ; alves et al .",

    "a number of theoretical studies determine that the widths of the column density pdfs correlate with the level of turbulence in mcs ( e.g. , padoan et al .",
    "1997 ; federrath et al .",
    "2008 ; klessen 2000 ) , while the high - extinction regimes of the pdfs correlate with the amount of high - density , self - gravitating , and potentially star - forming gas in mcs ( e.g. , collins et al . 2012 ; federrath & klessen 2013 ; clark & glover 2014 ; ward et al .",
    "indeed , a number of observational studies have found that pdfs derived from dust measurements have a ubiquitous log - normal distribution over a narrow range of column densities and exhibit a characteristic power - law `` tail '' at high densities above visual magnitudes of @xmath9 ( e.g. , kainulainen et al . 2009 ; froebrich & rowles 2010 ; lombardi et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "however , a consensus on how to interpret the widths and _ low_-extinction regimes of the dust pdfs has not been reached .",
    "this is because the dust extinction or emission observations used to derive the column density map toward a given mc has an inherent lower limit that is defined by the noise level of the observations .",
    "therefore , the width of a pdf  which may or may not be a manifestation of the amount of turbulence in a cloud  depends on the lowest level contour used to determine that pdf ( lombardi et al . 2015 ) .    while a number of studies have been dedicated to understanding the column density pdfs of clouds from dust measurements , there are far fewer observational treatments of the pdfs of the atomic gas associated with mcs .",

    "perhaps the combination of other physical conditions in these regions  such as dust content , magnetic fields , turbulence , and temperature  make them ill - suited for the formation of molecular clouds .",
    "alternatively , these high - density @xmath0  regions may be the precursors of future generations of molecular clouds .      toward the mcs in our sample , as indicated by the red curves in figures [ fig8 ]  [ fig14 ] , there is a dearth of low - column - density @xmath0  with @xmath97 .",
    "this stands in contrast to the nicest pdfs ( gray curves ) , which  taking into account all of the gaseous material , atomic and molecular , toward the clouds  seem to reveal an excess of low - column - density material .",
    "by contrast , most of the low - density @xmath0  resides in the larger regions surrounding the mcs ( pink curves in figures [ fig8 ]  [ fig14 ] ) . of the clouds in this sample , the @xmath0  pdfs toward ophiuchus , perseus , and orion a ( red curves ) exhibit the most amount of low - column - density material , with @xmath98 .",
    "the dispersions of the @xmath0  pdfs , @xmath59 , are uniformly narrow , averaging @xmath99 .",

    "( 1989 ) noted the asymmetrical , `` windswept '' appearance of the @xmath0  emission in the region , arising due to the marked density gradient from east to west ( in equatorial coordinates ) .",
    "this asymmetry is also strikingly apparent in galactic coordinates as a north - south gradient ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this dramatic density gradient may partially explain the relatively wide dispersion of the orion a @xmath0  pdf .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss how adjusting the kinematic and spatial boundaries we used to select @xmath0  emission ( see  [ sec : maps ] ) impacts the shape of the pdf .",
    "the purpose of this exercise is to gauge the robustness of our results , especially given our limited knowledge about what @xmath0  emission `` belongs '' to a cloud complex .",
    "first , we assess how integrating over different velocity ranges of @xmath0  emission modifies the pdf .",
    "we compare three different velocity ranges : a `` normal '' range ( those listed in table [ table1 ] ) , a narrow range , and a wide range . for the narrow range ,",
    "we shift the minimum ( maximum ) velocities listed in table [ table1 ] inward , by @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we also integrate over a wide range of velocities , by expanding the minimum ( maximum ) velocities in table [ table1 ] by @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",

    "but when changing the range of velocities over which one integrates , _ the narrow , log - normal shape of the @xmath0  pdf is retained_. this trend holds for the other clouds in our sample , the summary for which is in table [ table3 ] . with few exceptions , the dispersions of the pdfs",

    "the table shows that when the spatial boundary defining an mc is increased ( @xmath110 decreases ) , the general trend is for the peak of the pdf to shift by small amounts toward lower column densities .",
    "expanding the spatial boundaries by @xmath3 mag to include more atomic gas does not result in an excess of low - column - density material below the peak of the @xmath0  pdf .",

    "@xmath79 and @xmath59 remain the same , to within the 1-@xmath57 margin of error , leading us to conclude that our choice of the 1 mag contour is appropriate and that our results are robust .",
    "a comparison of the extinction map pdfs and @xmath0  pdfs towards mcs , ( gray and red curves , respectively , in figures [ fig8 ]  [ fig14 ] ) , shows that most of the low - column - density material towards mcs can not be explained by warm , diffuse atomic hydrogen .",
