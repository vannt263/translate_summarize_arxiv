    "_ ab initio _ treatments of electronic systems become unworkable for sufficiently complex systems . on the other hand , the kohn - sham formulation  @xcite of density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite incorporates many - body correlations ( beyond hartree - fock ) , while only single - particle ( sp ) equations must be solved . due to this simplicity dft",
    "is the only feasible approach in some modern applications of electronic structure theory .",
    "there is therefore a continuing interest both in developing new and more accurate functionals and in studying conceptual improvements and extensions to the dft framework .",
    "in particular it is found that dft can handle short - range interelectronic correlations quite well , while there is room for improvements in the description of long - range ( van der waals ) forces and dissociation processes .",
    "microscopic theories offer some guidance in the development of extensions to dft .",
    "orbital dependent functionals can be constructed using many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt )  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the development of general _ ab initio _ dft  @xcite addressed the lack of a systematic improvement in dft methods . in this approach",
    "one considers an expansion of the exact ground - state wave function ( e.g. , mbpt or coupled cluster ) from a chosen reference determinant . requiring that the correction to the density vanishes at a certain level of perturbation theory allows one to construct the corresponding approximation to the kohn - sham potential .",
    "a different route has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite by developing a quasi - particle ( qp)-dft formalism . in the qp - dft approach the full spectral function",
    "is decomposed in the contribution of the qp excitations , and a remainder or background part",
    ". the latter part is complicated , but does not need to be known accurately : it is sufficient to have a functional model for the energy - averaged background part to set up a single - electron selfconsistency problem that generates the qp excitations .",
    "such an approach is appealing since it contains the well - developed standard kohn - sham formulation of dft as a special case , while at the same time emphasis is put on the correct description of qps , in the landau - migdal sense  @xcite .",
    "hence , it can provide an improved description of the dynamics at the fermi surface .",
    "given the close relation between qp - dft and the green s function ( gf ) formulation of many - body theory  @xcite , it is natural to employ _ ab initio _ calculations in the latter formalism to investigate the structure of possible qp - dft functionals . in this respect",
    "it is imperative to identify which classes of diagrams are responsible for the correct description of the qp physics .",
    "some previous calculations , based on gf theory , have focused on a self - consistent treatment of the self - energy at the second order  @xcite for simple atoms and molecules .",
    "for the atomic binding energies it was found that the bulk of correlations , beyond hartree - fock , are accounted for while significant disagreement with experiment persists for qp properties like ionization energies and electron affinities .",
    "the formalism beyond the second - order approximation was taken up in ref .",
    "@xcite by employing a self - energy of the @xmath0 type  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", the random phase approximation ( rpa ) in the particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) channel is adopted to allow for possible collective effects on the atomic excited states .",
    "the latter are coupled to the sp states by means of diagrams like the last two in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigr](c ) .",
    "two variants of the @xmath1 formalism were employed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where the subscript `` @xmath2 '' indicates that non - dressed propagators are used ) .",
    "in the first only the direct terms of the interelectron coulomb potential are taken into account . in the second version ,",
    "also the exchange terms are included when diagonalizing the _ ph _ space [ generalized rpa ( grpa ) ] and in constructing the self - energy [ generalized @xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) ] .",
    "although the exchange terms are known to be crucial in order to reproduce the experimentally observed rydberg sequence in the excitation spectrum of neutral atoms , they were found to worsen the agreement between the theoretical and experimental ionization energies  @xcite .    in the @xmath0 approach the sp states",
    "are directly coupled with the two - particle  one - hole ( _ 2p1h _ ) and the two - hole ",
    "one - particle ( _ 2h1p _ ) spaces . however , only partial diagonalizations ( namely , in the _ ph _ subspaces ) are performed .",
    "this procedure unavoidably neglects pauli correlations with the third particle ( or hole ) outside the subspace . in the case of the @xmath3 approach",
    ", this leads to a double counting of the second order self - energy which must be corrected for explicitly  @xcite .",
    "we note that simply subtracting the double counted diagram is not completely satisfactory here , since it introduces poles with negative residues in the self - energy . more important , the interaction between electrons in the two - particle ( _ pp _ ) and two - hole ( _ hh _ ) subspaces are neglected altogether in ( @xmath4)@xmath0 . clearly , it is necessary to identify which contributions , beyond @xmath3 , are needed to correctly reproduce the qp spectrum .    in this respect , it is known that highly accurate descriptions of the qp properties in finite systems can be obtained with the algebraic diagrammatic construction ( adc ) method of schirmer and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "the most widely used third - order version [ adc(3 ) ] is equivalent to the so - called extended @xmath5 tamm - dancoff ( tda ) method  @xcite and allows to predict ionization energies with an accuracy of 10 - 20 mh in atoms and small molecules . upon inspection of its diagrammatic content , the adc(3 ) self - energy",
    "is seen to contain all diagrams where tda excitations are exchanged between the three propagator lines of the intermediate @xmath5 or @xmath6 propagation .",
    "the tda excitations are constructed through a diagonalization in either @xmath5 or @xmath6 space , and neglect ground - state correlations .",
    "however , it is clear that use of tda leads to difficulties for extended systems . in the high - density electron gas _",
    "e.g. _ , the correct plasmon spectrum requires the rpa in the @xmath7 channel , rather than tda .    in order to bridge the gap between the qp description in finite and extended systems",
    ", it seems therefore necessary to develop a formalism where the intermediate excitations in the @xmath8 propagator are described at the rpa level .",
    "this can be achieved by a formalism based on employing a set of faddeev equations , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently applied to nuclear structure problems  @xcite . in this approach the grpa equations are solved separately in the _ ph _ and _ pp / hh _ subspaces .",
    "the resulting polarization and two - particle propagators are then coupled through an all - order summation that accounts completely for pauli exchanges in the _",
    "2p1h_/_2h1p _ spaces .",
    "this faddeev - rpa ( f - rpa ) formalism is required if one wants to couple propagators at the rpa level or beyond .",
    "apart from correctly incorporating pauli exchange , f - rpa takes the explicit inclusion of ground - state correlations into account , and can therefore be expected to apply to both finite and extended systems .",
    "the adc(3 ) formalism is recovered as an approximation by neglecting ground - state correlations in the intermediate excitations ( _ i.e. _ replacing rpa with tda phonons ) .",
    "in this work we consider the neon atom and apply the f - rpa method to a nonrelativistic electronic problem for the first time .",

    "we will employ the convention of summing over repeated indices , unless specified otherwise .",
    "given a complete orthonormal basis set of sp states , labeled by @xmath9,@xmath10 , ... , the sp propagator can be written in its lehmann representation as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12   ( @xmath13 ) are the spectroscopic amplitudes , @xmath14  ( @xmath15 ) are the second quantization destruction ( creation ) operators and @xmath16  ( @xmath17 ) . in these definitions ,",

    "in addition , one can in principle employ dressed sp propagators in these equations to generate a self - consistent solution .",
    "if we neglect the ladder propagator @xmath49  ( [ eq : g2 ] ) in this expansion , we are left with the ring series alone and the analogous physics ingredients as for the generalized @xmath0 approach .",
    "however , this differs from @xmath3 due to the fact that no double counting of the second - order self - energy occurs , since the pauli exchanges between the polarization propagator and the third line are properly accounted for ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : faddex ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can suppress the polarization propagator to investigate the effects of _ pp / hh _ ladders alone .",
    "it is instructive to replace in the above equations all rpa phonons with tda ones ; this amounts to allowing only forward - propagating diagrams in fig .",

    ".  [ intro ] , the the f - rpa self - energy contains rpa excitations of both @xmath7 type ( ring diagrams ) and @xmath56 type ( ladder diagrams ) .",
    "it is instructive to analyze their separate contributions to the final ionization energies , in order to understand how the f - rpa self - energy is related to the standard @xmath57 self - energy .",
    "table  [ tab:4 ] compares the results for the ionization energies , obtained with the second - order self - energy , to different approximations for including the ring summations .",
    "as one can see , the second - order self - energy generates an @xmath54=1 sp energy of -0.747  mh , which is 46  mh above the empirical @xmath58 ionization energy .",
    "the @xmath1 self - energy , which includes the ring summation with only direct coulomb matrix elements , improves this result and brings it close to experiment .",
    "the @xmath59 behaves in a similar way .",
    "unfortunately , including the exchange terms of the interelectron repulsion in the @xmath60 method turns out to have the opposite effect ( the @xmath58 ionization energy becomes -0.712 h  @xcite and the @xmath60 results of ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained by retaining only the diagonal part of the electron self - energy ,  @xmath61 in the hf+continuum basis .",
    "this approximation was _ not _ made in the present work .",
    "the error in the ionization energies by retaining the diagonal approximation is quite small ( about @xmath622  mh  @xcite for the ne atom ) , but larger effects are possible for the total binding energy . ] ) and the agreement with experiment is lost .",
    "obviously , @xmath60 is too simplistic to account for exchange in the @xmath7 channel .    with the f - rpa(ring ) self - energy one",
    "can go one step further and employ the faddeev expansion to also force proper pauli exchange correlations in the _",
    "2p1h_/_2h1p _ spaces . as shown in table  [ tab:4 ] , this enhances the screening due to the exchange interaction terms , leading to even less binding for the @xmath59 and @xmath58 . the corrections relative to the second - order self - energy can be large ( 100 mh for the @xmath59 state ) and in the direction away from the experimental value .",
    "we also note that the larger shift , in the 2@xmath63 orbit , is accompanied by an increase of the fragmentation  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sh ] and tab .",
    "[ tab:4 ] ) .",
    "similar observations were also made in ref .",
    "@xcite for other atoms : in general ring summations in the direct channel alone bring the quasihole peaks close to the experiment .",
    "this agreement is then spoiled as soon as one includes proper exchange terms in the self - energy . on the other hand , exchange in the _ ph _ channel",
    "is required to reproduce the correct rydberg sequence in the excitation spectrum of neutral atoms .",
    "so further corrections must arise from other diagrams , and obviously the summation of ladder diagrams can play a relevant role , since these contribute to the expansion of the self - energy at the same level as that of the ring diagrams .",
    "the result when only including ladder - type rpa phonons in the f - rpa self - energy is also shown in table  [ tab:4 ] .",
    "one can see that _",
    "pp / hh _ ladders do actually work in the opposite way as the _ ph _ channel ring diagrams , and have the same order of magnitude with , _ e.g. _ , a shift of 66 mh for the @xmath59 relative to the second - order result . when combined with the ring diagrams in the full f - rpa self - energy , the agreement with experiment",
    "is restored again .",
    "note that the final result can not be obtained by adding the contributions of rings and ladders , but depends nontrivially on the interplay between these classes of diagrams thereby pointing to significant interference effects .    with the f - rpa(ring ) self - energy , where only the contributions of the @xmath7 channel are included , the main peaks listed in table  [ tab:4 ] are not only considerably shifted but also strongly depleted , _",
    "e.g. _ a strength of only 0.56 for the main @xmath59 peak .",
    "the complete spectral function for the @xmath64 strength in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh ] shows that the depletion of the main fragment is accompanied by strong fragmentation over several states . while correlation effects are overestimated in f - rpa(ring ) , they are suppressed in f - rpa(ladder ) , where only the @xmath56 ladders are included in the self - energy . in this case one",
    "finds a spectral distribution closer to the hf one , with a main @xmath59 fragment of strength 0.95 and less fragmentation than the the second - order self - energy .",
    "the spectral distribution generated by the complete f - rpa self - energy is again a combination of the above effects .",
    "the strength of the deeply bound @xmath65 orbital behaves in an analogous way .",
    "the strength of the main peak is reduced but several satellite levels appear due to the mixing with @xmath6 configurations . in all the calculations reported in fig .  [",
    "fig : sh ] we found a summed @xmath64 strength exceeding 0.98 in the interval [ -40 h , -30 h ] which can be associated with the @xmath65 orbital , and this remains true even in the presence of strong correlations using the f - rpa(ring ) self - energy .",
    "of course , the mixing with @xmath66 configurations , not included in this work , may further contribute to the fragmentation pattern in this energy region .",
    "in conclusion , the electronic self - energy for the ne atom was computed by the f - rpa method which includes simultaneously the effects of both ring and ladder diagrams .",
    "this was accomplished by employing an expansion of the self - energy based on a set of faddeev equations .",
    "this technique was originally proposed for nuclear structure applications  @xcite and is described in the appendix . at the level of the self - energy one",
    "sums all diagrams where the three propagator lines of the intermediate @xmath5 or @xmath6 propagation are connected by repeated exchange of rpa excitations in both the @xmath7 and the @xmath56 channel .",
    "this differs from the adc(3 ) formalism in the fact that the exchanged excitations are of the rpa type , rather than the tda type , and therefore take ground - state correlations effects into account .",
    "the coupling to the external points of the self - energy uses the same modified vertex as in adc(3 ) , which must be introduced to include consistently all third - order perturbative contributions .",
    "the resulting main ionization energies in the neon atom are at least of the same quality , and even somewhat improved , compared to the adc(3 ) result .",
    "note that , numerically , f - rpa can be implemented as a diagonalization in @xmath8 space implying about the same cost as adc(3 ) .",
    "the present study also shows that in localized electronic systems subtle cancellations occur between the ring and ladder series .",
    "in particular , only a combination of the ring and ladder series leads to sensible results , as the separate ring series tends to correct the second - order result in the wrong direction .",
    "since the limit to extended systems requires an rpa treatment of excitations , the f - rpa method holds promise to bridge the gap between an accurate description of quasiparticles in both finite and extended systems .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0 treatment of the electron gas has been shown to yield excellent binding energies , but poor quasiparticle properties  @xcite .",
    "further progress beyond @xmath0 theory requires a consistent incorporation of exchange in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "the f - rpa technique may be highly relevant in this respect .",
    "a common framework for calculating accurate qp properties in both finite and extended systems , is also important for constraining functionals in quasiparticle density functional theory ( qp - dft )  @xcite .",
    "finally , complete self - consistency requires sizable computational efforts for bases as large as the hf+continuum basis used here .",
    "it would nevertheless represent an important extension of the present work , since it is related to the fulfillment of conservation laws  @xcite .",
