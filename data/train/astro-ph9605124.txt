    "new understanding of the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) has come from the discovery of the high energy gamma - ray radiation in the range @xmath3 mev by the egret instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( e.g. , hartman et al .",
    "1992 ; mattox et al . 1993 ; thompson et al .",
    "this radiation is observed from a sub - class of agns termed blazars , which include optically violently variable ( ovv ) quasars and bl lac objects and which show strong variability in all wavebands from radio to gamma .",
    "many of the objects reveal ` super - luminal ' jets in vlbi maps which indicate that we observe matter of the jet pointed nearly towards us and that the jet matter moves with relativistic speed .",
    "prior to the compton observatory measurements , prediction of strong , collimated gamma - ray emission from agn relativistic jet sources was made by the electromagnetic cascade model of lovelace , macauslan , and burns ( 1979 ) and burns and lovelace ( 1982 ) .",
    "more recently , a number of theoretical models have been developed to explain the observed gamma - ray emission of agns ( see review by sikora 1994 ) . in most of the models the gamma - ray radiation is ascribed to inverse - compton scattering of relativisitic electrons and possibly positrons ( lorentz factors @xmath4 ) of a jet having relativistic bulk motion ( lorentz factor @xmath5 ) with soft photons ( energies @xmath6 ev ) .",
    "the soft photons can arise from the synchrotron emission of the relativistic electrons in the jet as in the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) models ( maraschi , ghisellini , and celotti 1992 ; marscher and bloom , 1992 ) or from the direct or scattered thermal radiation from an accretion disk ( dermer , schlickeiser , and mastichiadis 1992 ; blandford 1993 ; and sikora , begelman , and rees 1994 ) , or from a single cloud ( ghisellini and madau 1996 ) .",
    "the spectrum of blazars in a pair cascade model was calculated by levinson and blandford ( 1995 ) and levinson ( 1996 ) . in different models ,",
    "ultra high energy protons ( lorentz factors @xmath7 ) are postulated to cause a cascade , the product particles of which produce the observed radiation ( mannheim and biermann 1992 ) , or the jets considered to be ultra relativistic with bulk lorentz factors @xmath8 ( coppi , kartje , and knigl 1993 ) .    here",
    ", we propose that the main driving force for the observed superluminal jet components is a finite amplitude discontinuity in a poynting flux jet .",
    "a brief discussion of the model was given earlier ( lovelace and romanova 1996 ) .",
    "a rapid change in the poynting jet outflow from a disk can result from implosive accretion in a disk with an ordered magnetic field ( lovelace , romanova , and newman 1994 ) .",
    "propagation of newly expelled em field and matter from the disk with higher velocity than the old jet can under certain conditions lead to the formation of a pair of shock waves as in the case of non - relativistic hydrodynamic flow ( raga et al .",
    "particle acceleration in the front may result from the shocks or from annihilation and/or reconnection of oppositely directed magnetic fields in the front ( romanova and lovelace 1992 and lovelace , newman , and romanova 1996 ) .",
    "section 2 derives a complete set of equations for the front , specifically , equations for the total number of particles , the total momentum , energy , and magnetic flux in the front .",
    "section 3 discusses and summarizes the behavior of the solutions of the front equations .",
    "section 4 gives comparisons of predictions of the theory with observations .",
    "conclusions of this work are given in section 5 .",
    "we use an inertial , cylindrical coordinate system @xmath9 with the origin at the black hole s center and the @xmath10axis normal to the accretion disk as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this is referred to as the ` lab frame ' .",
    "we consider that poynting flux jets propagate symmetrically away from the disk in the @xmath11 directions , but focus our attention on the approaching @xmath12 jet .",
    "a poynting flux jet is _ self - collimated _ , with energy , momentum , and angular momentum transported mainly by the electromagnetic fields ( lovelace , wang , and sulkanen 1987 ) .",
    "the collimation results from the toroidal magnetic field at the edge of the jet . a steady poynting jet can be characterized in the lab frame by its asymptotic @xmath13 magnetic field @xmath14 $ ] , and electric field @xmath15 $ ] at the jet s edge , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the jet s radius at @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the jet s axial velocity , and @xmath20 is the lab frame field strength at @xmath18 .",
    "the jet plasma consists of both ions and leptons ( electrons and positrons ) with the ratio of leptons to ions @xmath21 the initial jet radius is taken to be @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the black hole mass . the energy flux ( luminosity ) of the @xmath12 jet",
    "is the poynting flux @xmath24 constant .",
    "we propose that the poynting jet from the disk changes abruptly at time @xmath25 .",
    "that is , the jet parameters change from values with subscript ( 1 ) to subscript ( 2 ) at @xmath25 , @xmath26 in actuality the change will be with a time scale determined by the disk dynamics as in the implosive accretion model of lovelace et al .",
    ". this time scale may be as short as @xmath27 in the lab frame . in the present work we consider @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number density of ions .",
    "the change in the jet parameters produces a ` front ' which propagates outward as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the front may involve a pair of shock waves , one for the incoming old jet matter and the other for the incoming new jet matter .",

    "the total number of ions in the front grows with time , because under most conditions the front moves faster than the old jet matter and slower than the new jet matter , thus accumulating particles from both sides .",
    "this is shown in figure 4 .",
    "for the case shown there is no pair production .",
    "thus , the ratio of leptons to ions @xmath212 decreases with time and approaches unity .",

    "these are shown in figure 7 . at early times in an outburst , the ssc radiation predominates because the magnetic field in the front is strong and the number of synchrotron photons is higher than that of background photons .",
    "later , the magnetic field in the front decreases and thus the background photons predominate . at the same time , the leptons are accelerated in the front and consequently inverse - compton radiation grows , and then later decreases .",
    "the time of the peak of the inverse - compton emission depends approximately linearly on the radius @xmath126 of the background photon distribution .",
    "synchrotron radiation is at much lower luminosity during the first part of the front propagation .",
    "the dependences of the maximum luminosities of the different processes are discussed later .",
    "the observed frequency is boosted by a factor @xmath222 .",
    "the frequencies of radiation corresponding to different processes and to the characteristic values @xmath160 , @xmath179 , and @xmath214 of the lepton distribution , are shown in figure 8 .",
    "one can see that the radiation of the front covers most of the frequency range from the self - absorption limit ( the lowest curve ) , up to high gamma ray energies .",
    "in many bands of the spectrum , there are contributions from two processes . for example , in the egret band ( from @xmath223 hz to @xmath224 hz ) we typically have contributions from both inverse - compton and ssc radiation . initially , synchrotron radiation contributes to the band from ir to uv , ssc covers the range of frequencies from soft x - ray to egret gev energies , and the inverse - compton covers the range from the high - energy x - ray to the egret gev energies .",
    "thus , during an egret high - energy flare one may expect almost simultaneous flashes in wavebands from ir to very high energies , excluding the radio band which is initially self - absorbed .",
    "the maxima of the total apparent luminosities due to inverse - compton ( @xmath225 ) , synchrotron - self - compton ( @xmath226 ) and synchrotron processes ( @xmath227 ) depend on the parameters @xmath219 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath23 , @xmath212 , @xmath126 , and @xmath230 approximately as @xmath231 @xmath232 @xmath233 @xmath234 @xmath235 @xmath236 if the parameters are of the order of the normalization values .",

    "the luminosities go to a constant .",
    "the dependences on @xmath228 are valid for @xmath240 g , and become flatter for stronger fields .",
    "the dependence on @xmath212 is about the same as in equation ( 15 ) for @xmath241 , and becomes steeper for ssc and synchrotron radiation for @xmath242 and does not depend on @xmath212 for @xmath243 . as for the dependences on @xmath219 ,",

    "the dependence on @xmath23 is approximately the same at all parameter ranges .",
    "notice that the shape of the light curves are quite different for different parameters .",
    "there are several possibilities : ( * 1 * ) both ssc and compton radiation may be in the egret band .",
    "then , the shape of the egret light curve is determined essentially by the ssc radiation which gives a fast rise of luminosity with typical time scale of growth @xmath246 days @xmath247 min ( see figure 9a ) .",
    "the rise time may of course be slower due to a more gradual transistion from the old jet to the new .",
    "( * 2 * ) ssc radiation frequencies may be lower than the egret band so that only compton radiation is observed .",
    "then , the light curve shape will be determined by compton radiation with a maximum at @xmath248 days for our reference values ( see figure 9b ) .",
    "( * 3 * ) no radiation may fall in the egret band .",
    "for example , changing @xmath229 ( with other parameters fixed ) we get a sharp ssc flare for @xmath249 , a flatter compton flare for @xmath250 , and no radiation in the egret band for @xmath251 .",
    "thus , for this set of parameters , the value @xmath229 , which is the initial ratio of magnetic to rest mass energy - density , should be relatively high .",
    "the shape of the egret light curves also depends , for example , on the initial ratio of leptons to ions . for @xmath252 ,",
    "ssc type flares predominate . for @xmath241 , compton type flares predominate , and for @xmath242 , no radiation falls in the egret band .",
    "thus , the shape of the flare may be different in different sources or may change in the same source between different outbursts , depending on the magnetic / particle rest mass energy - density ratio , or on the initial ratio of leptons to ions in the front plasma .",
    "the maxima of the flares in the ssc and synchrotron radiation occur very soon after outburst ( much less than a day ) .",
    "the maximum of the inverse - compton flare is much later and may be observable , @xmath253 in days .",
    "note that @xmath254 has essentially no dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "later , after the maxima , all luminosities decrease .",
    "the ssc luminosity decreases as @xmath255 , the synchrotron luminosity as @xmath256 , and the inverse - compton luminosity as @xmath257 for @xmath258 days , but later for @xmath259 days it flattens to @xmath260 .",
    "the rise of the inverse - compton luminosity is determined by the growth of the number and energy of leptons in the front .",
    "the front is transparent to inverse - compton radiation from the beginning .",
    "at the same time , initially plasma of the front is opaque to the synchrotron photons , and the rapid growth of synchrotron and ssc radiation is determined by the fact that plasma becomes transparent to synchrotron photons .",
    "the decline of inverse - compton radiation is due to the fact that the energy density of background photons decreases in the front frame .",
    "an important factor in the decrease is the doppler shift of the background photons relative to the front for @xmath261 . as for synchrotron and ssc radiation",
    ", they decrease with time because the magnetic field in the front decreases with time .",
    "here , we compare theoretical and observed light curves .",
    "the luminosity in the egret band @xmath262 hz is determined in general by both inverse - compton and ssc processes .",
    "we integrated the gamma radiation in the egret band and got two qualitatively different types of light curves ( figures 9a and 9b ) .",
    "the difference is determined by the fact that in some cases ( depending on parameters ) ssc radiation is below the egret frequency limit and the light curve is determined by the inverse - compton light curve ( see figure 9b ) . in the opposite case ,",
    "when the ssc radiation is within the egret band , the light curve is determined by both processes , but the ssc radiation has a strong peak at small time scales , and this determines the shape of the light curve ( figure 9a ) . in the first case ,",
    "it is more probable to observe the fast rise and gradual decrease of gamma luminosity , compared with the second case , where the rise of luminosity is so fast ( maximum reached at @xmath263 days ) that it will be difficult to observe and only the ` tail ' of the flare will be seen ( see , however , mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "egret observations of gamma - ray blazars show different types of flares . in some cases",
    "the growth of the luminosity is relatively slow compared with the decay ( kniffen et al . 1993 ) . in other cases ( for example , hartman et al . 1993 ) , only a decaying light curve is observed during the egret set of observations . in the third type of flare , the rise of the luminosity is much faster than the decay ( mattox et al .",

    "time resolved observations of the brightest observed gamma - ray flare from blazar pks 1622 - 29 ( mattox et al . 1996 ) show that during the main flare the flux increases by an order of magnitude on a 2 hour time scale , whereas the decay is on a 7 hour time scale .",
    "thus the rise is faster than the decay .",
    "we fitted this flare by a ` compton type ' flare using the parameters : @xmath264 , @xmath265 g , @xmath266 rad @xmath267 , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 pc , @xmath271 ev , @xmath272 ergs / s , and @xmath129 .",
    "this is shown in figure 10 .",
    "for calculation of the theoretical flux we used standard formulae for the luminosity distance at the redshift of the source @xmath273 , hubble s constant @xmath274 km / s / mpc , and a cosmological parameter @xmath275 . also , we took into account the cosmological redshift of the frequencies and the dilation of the time scale of the outburst .",
    "the value @xmath129 of figure 10 corresponds to background photons scattered by clouds ( sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) , and it gives a more symmetric compton flare than @xmath128 .",
    "we also obtained fits to the pks flare with @xmath128 where the background photons come from the disk ( dermer et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the fit of our model to the pks 1622 - 29 data is not unique , but the fitting in all cases requires a relatively massive black hole ( @xmath276 ) and a relatively strong magnetic field at the base of the jet ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "also , it appears necessary to have an initial ratio of magnetic field to rest mass energy - density large compared with unity , @xmath278 .",
    "note that the quasar pks 1622 - 297 is the brightest gamma - ray quasar ( mattox , et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "in other lower gamma luminosity blazars , @xmath23 and/or @xmath228 may be smaller .",
    "the appearance of one type of flare or another , and also the strength of the flares , depends on values of the plasma parameters ( @xmath212 , @xmath229 , @xmath228 ) which may be random .",
    "flares where the stage of growth is very short may be explained by ` spike ' type ssc flares ( figure 9a ) , whereas the slower rising gamma light curves may be inverse - compton flares ( figure 9a ) .",
    "note , that the fast growth and decay of luminosity in the beginning of the strong pks 1622 - 29 flare may be connected with ` spike ' type ssc flare , which appears at smaller initial lepton - ion number ratios ( @xmath279 ) .    in the present model",
    ", we proposed that the new poynting jet pushes matter continuously .",
    "however , if the push decreases with time , then the front will lose energy as a result of radiation and the luminosity will decrease more rapidly than that show here .",
    "this effect may also explain rapid decay , compared with growth , of the prominent flare of the quasar 3c 279 ( kniffen et al . 1993 ) .",
    "analysis of the correlation between gamma - ray flares and those in radio emissions at short time scales has shown that there is no direct correlation in most blazars ( reich et al .",
    "moreover , often the radio flux is in the low state during the gamma - ray flare .",
    "however , observations on longer time - scales show that after strong flares in the egret band , the radio luminosity starts to grow and has a maximum several months later than the gamma - ray flare ( reich et al .",
    "this may result from either synchrotron self - absorption or free - free absorption by plasma surrounding the source core ( matveyenko et al .",
    "thus , the radio emission appears at later times when the density in the front and/or the external density are much lower .    in our model",
    "the synchrotron self - absorption frequency is initially in the infrared or uv , depending on parameters .",
    "thus , initially , there is no radio emission from the front .",
    "later , the self - absorption frequency @xmath280 slowly decreases ( figure 8) and goes to @xmath281 mm ( @xmath282 hz ) after several days .",
    "much later , @xmath280 falls into the cm radio band . for some parameters of the model",
    ", the millimeter emission appears one or two weeks after the flare .",
    "initially , only a small fraction of the total luminosity goes into low frequencies , and the radio flux is very small . because of the slow decrease of @xmath280 with time , @xmath283 hz , the maximum of the radio luminosity may be a few months later than the gamma - ray flare . here , we did not take into account possible free - free absorption of radio waves by distributed plasma in the core of the source exterior to the jet .",
    "this absorption may also contribute to the delay in the appearance of the radio emission .",
    "the present model of a propagating front in a poynting flux jet is similar in some respects to the model of radio variability of aller , aller , and hughes ( 1985 ) and hughes , aller , and aller ( 1985 ) based on weak shocks propagating along a hydrodynamic jet .",
    "detailed multi - frequency radio observations of the quasar 0528 + 134 shows that after a strong gamma - ray flare , the radio flux grows and has a maximum few months later ( pohl et al .",
    "it is important to note that during this event , the new vlbi super - luminal component appeared with a back - extrapolat - ed time of origin close to the time of the gamma - ray flare ( krichbaum et al , 1995 ) .",
    "these observations support the present model where a strong impulsive disturbance - the front - propagates along and is powered by an otherwise invisible poynting flux jet .",
    "the front radiates first in gamma rays , and later becomes strong in the radio when it is observed as a new super - luminal vlbi jet component .",
    "the paper develops a self - consistent dynamical model of gamma - ray flares and vlbi outbursts of blazars based on lepton acceleration in the propagating front of an otherwise invisible poynting flux jet .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of the accelerated , relativistic leptons off of background photons as well as off of synchrotron photons ( the ssc process ) and synchrotron radiation are taken into account .",
    "it is shown that gamma - ray flares in the frequency band of the egret instrument ( at @xmath284 mev ) may be of two types : ( * 1 . * ) ` ssc spikes ' which have a fast rise ( @xmath285 hr . ) and gradual decay of luminosity .",
    "this type of flare appears in the cases where ssc photons have high enough energy to be in the egret band . in this case",
    "inverse - compton radiation , which usually gives a smaller contribution to the luminosity , is hidden by the strong ssc flare .",
    "( * 2 . * ) ` compton flares ' which have a growth time of few hours and a duration of days up to weeks ( depending on the distribution of background photons and viewing angle ) .",
    "comparison with recent observations of the gamma - ray flare in pks 1622 - 297 ( mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) show that it may be interpreted as a ` compton flare '",
    ". to explain the high luminosity and the short duration of the pks flare , the viewing angle must be quite small , @xmath0 rad . also , we need a black hole mass @xmath286 and a magnetic field at the base of the jet @xmath2 g.    the model gives almost simultaneous flares for photon energies from high - energy gamma - ray to lower energy gamma , x - ray , uv , visible , and down to the infrared .",
    "the short wavelength ( mm ) radio flare for some parameters may appear shortly ( @xmath285 days ) after the main gamma flare , because the self - absorption frequency , which initially corresponds to the ir region of spectrum , decreases rapidly during a few days ( see figure 8) to short wavelength radio band ( in some cases , however , mm radiation may appear much later ) .",
    "later , it decreases more slowly , so that the centimeter waveband radio radiation in most of the cases should appear much later ( @xmath285 months ) than the gamma - ray flare .    in many gamma ray loud objects , both flares and steady radiation",
    "are observed ( fichtel and thompson 1994 ; montigny et al .",
    "the steady radiation may come from a superposition of a number of overlapping outbursts .",
    "in other cases , the egret instrument detects only the highest states of strong flares with the weaker steady emission obscured in the noise .",
    "extremely high energy photons ( @xmath285 tev ) have been detected from the object markarian 421 ( punch et al .",
    "here , we comment on the possible origin of tev photons in the framework of the present model .",
    "tev radiation may result from from the ssc process by lepton scattering off of synchrotron photons if the lepton distribution function extends to sufficiently high lorentz factors ( @xmath287 ) .",
    "however , the magnetic field at the base of the jet @xmath228 may have to be smaller than the values considered here ( @xmath288 g ) in order to avoid excessive pair production .",
