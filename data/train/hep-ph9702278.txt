    "there are three rare decay modes of the long lived kaon which have interrelated theoretical issues : @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the first two have been extensively studied ; the latter has not been previously calculated .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to provide a calculation of the latter process and describe how it is related to the phenomenology of the other two decays .",
    "there is a curious and important inverted hierarchy of these decay modes .",
    "the rate for the radiative decay @xmath7 is a power of @xmath8 _ larger _ than the nonradiative transition @xmath6 .",
    "this is because the @xmath6 transition occurs only through a two - photon intermediate state , or alternatively through a one - photon exchange combined with cp violation ( which numerically appears to be roughly of the same size as the two - photon contribution ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 rate is then of order @xmath9 .",
    "however , in @xmath10 we need only a one - photon exchange to the @xmath11 , leading to a rate of order @xmath12 .",
    "our attention was first called to this inverted hierarchy by an observation that there are infrared divergences in a detailed study of the @xmath6 two - photon effect @xcite which need to be canceled by the one - loop corrections to the radiative mode @xmath10 through the contributions of the soft radiative photons .",
    "this implies that the theoretical _ and experimental _ analyses of @xmath13 and @xmath14are tied together .",
    "the soft and collinear photon regions of @xmath15 form potential backgrounds to the studies of cp violation in the @xmath6 mode .",
    "the @xmath10 mode also has an interest of its own . in recent years",
    "there have been important phenomenological studies of @xmath2 in connection with chiral perturbation theory ( chpth ) .",
    "this decay is calculable at one - loop ( , order e@xmath16 ) chpth with no free parameters , yielding a very distinctive spectrum and a definite rate @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , when the experiment was performed the spectrum was confirmed while the measured rate was more than a factor of 2 larger than predicted . the way out of this problem appears to have been provided by cohen , ecker , and pich ( cep ) @xcite . by adding an adjustable new effect at order e@xmath17 , as well as including known corrections to the @xmath18 vertex",
    ", they found that the predicted rate can be increased dramatically without modifying the shape of the spectrum much .",
    "this is also a surprising result , yet as far as we know it is the unique solution to the experimental puzzle .",
    "the ingredients of the mode studied in this paper , @xmath10 , are the same as for @xmath2 , except that one of the photons is off shell . within the framework of the cep calculation ,",
    "the ingredients enter with different relative weights for off - shell photons .",
    "this will allow us to test the consistency of the theoretical resolution proposed for @xmath2 .",
    "we outline the computation for the @xmath19(e@xmath16 ) contribution to the process in sec .",
    "ii , and then we extend it to @xmath19(e@xmath17 ) in sec .",
    "iii . finally , we recapitulate our conclusions in sec",
    "first let us provide the straightforward @xmath19(e@xmath16 ) calculation within chpth .",
    "this is the generalization to @xmath20 of the original chiral calculation of epr @xcite . here",
    "@xmath21 is the momentum of the off - shell photon .",
    "this captures all the @xmath22 and @xmath23 variations of the amplitudes at this order in the energy expansion .",
    "there can be further @xmath24/(1 gev)@xmath25 corrections which correspond to @xmath19(e@xmath17 ) and higher .",
    "the easiest technique for this calculation uses the basis where the kaon and pion fields are transformed so that the propagators have no off - diagonal terms , as described in ref .",
    "the relevant diagrams are then shown in fig .",
    "1 . defining @xmath26 as    @xmath27    the diagrams give the following integrals , respectively :    @xmath28 - 2 [ ( l^2-m^2_{\\pi})+(l - k_1-k_2)^2-m^2_{\\pi } ] } \\over { ( l^2-m^2_{\\pi})[(l - k_1-k_2)^2-m^2_{\\pi}]}},\\ ] ]    @xmath29 - 2 [ ( l+k_1)^2 -m^2_{\\pi } + ( l - k_2)^2 -m^2_{\\pi } ] } \\over { ( l^2-m^2_{\\pi})[(l+k_1)^2 - m^2_{\\pi}][(l - k_2)^2 - m^2_{\\pi } ] } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & ( 2 l + k_1)_{\\mu } ( 2 l -k_2)_{\\nu } + ( k_1 , \\mu ) \\leftrightarrow ( k_2 , \\nu),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath30    @xmath31 } } + { { ( 2 l -k_2)_{\\mu } ( 2 l -k_2)_{\\nu } } \\over { ( l^2-m^2_{\\pi } ) [ ( l - k_2)^2 - m^2_{\\pi}]}}\\right\\}.\\ ] ]",
    "interestingly when we add these together the @xmath32 amplitude factors out from the remaining loop integral resulting in    @xmath33 \\int{{d^4 l}\\over { ( 2\\pi^4 ) } } { { [ g_{\\mu\\nu}(l^2-m^2_{\\pi})- ( 2 l + k_1)_{\\mu } ( 2 l -k_2)_{\\nu } ] } \\over { { ( l^2-m^2_{\\pi } ) [ ( l+k_1)^2 - m^2_{\\pi } ] [ ( l - k_2)^2 - m^2_{\\pi}]}}}.\\ ] ]    it is not hard to verify that this result satisfies the constraints of gauge invariance @xmath34 = @xmath35 = 0 . at this stage ,",
    "the integral may be parametrized and integrated using standard feynman - diagram techniques .",
    "let us keep photon number one as the off - shell photon and set @xmath36 . in this case",

    "( 8) , substituting the mass of the pion with that of the kaon . attaching an @xmath11 couple to either photon and adding all the above contributions together , the result we obtain for the branching ratio is    @xmath47    with the definitions    @xmath48    the decay distributions in @xmath49 and @xmath50 provide more detailed information . we present them in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "we also wish to extend this calculation along the lines proposed by cep @xcite , who provide a plausible solution to the problem raised by the experimental rate not agreeing with the @xmath19(e@xmath16 ) calculation when both photons are on - shell .",
    "the two primary new ingredients involve known physics which surfaces at the next order in the energy expansion .",
    "the first involves the known quadratic energy variation of the @xmath32 amplitude , which occurs from higher order terms in the weak nonleptonic lagrangian @xcite .",
    "while the full one - loop structure of this is known @xcite , it involves complicated nonanalytic functions and we approximate the result at @xmath19(e@xmath16 ) by an analytic polynomial which provides a good description of the data throughout the physical region :    @xmath51    using    @xmath52    @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained from a fit to the amplitude for @xmath55 @xcite and to the amplitude and spectrum for @xmath56 @xcite , so that their values are constrained within their theoretical uncertainty of 10  20% .",
    "we have numerically verified that such a variation of said parameters involves a very modest change in the shape of the spectrum for @xmath57 and a change in its final branching ratio somewhat smaller than the uncertainty on the parameters .",
    "the other ingredient involves vector meson exchange such as in fig .",
    "4 . some of such contributions are known , but there are others such as those depicted in fig . 5 which have the same structure but an unknown strength , leaving the total result unknown . in ref .",
    "@xcite the result is parametrized by a `` subtraction constant '' which must be fit to the data .",
    "in principle one can add the ingredients to the amplitudes and perform a dispersive calculation of the total transition matrix element .",
    "in practice it is simple to convert the problem to an effective field theory and and do a feynman diagram calculation which will yield the same result .",
    "we follow this latter course .",
    "the feynman diagrams are the same as shown in fig .",
    "1 , although the vertices are modified by the presence of @xmath19(e@xmath16 ) terms in the energy expansion . not only does the direct @xmath32 vertex change to the form given in eq .",
    "( 18 ) , but also the weak vertices with one and two photons have a related change .",
    "the easiest way to determine these is to write a gauge invariant effective lagrangian with coefficients adjusted to reproduce eq . (",
    "we find    @xmath58    @xmath59    the resulting calculation follows the same steps as described above , but is more involved and is not easy to present in a simple form .",
