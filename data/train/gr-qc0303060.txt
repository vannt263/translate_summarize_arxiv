    "one of the enduringly , and endearingly , fascinating challenges in quantum gravity is to give meaning to the idea of quantising space , or space - time , at a level that is more fundamental than that of quantising a metric tensor on a background manifold .",
    "for example , one comes across phrases in the literature such as ` quantising causal sets whose elements represent points in a discrete model for space - time . if @xmath5 are such that @xmath6 then the physical interpretation is that an event at @xmath7 can causally influence events at @xmath8 . ] ' @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , or ` quantising topology ' , and the goal of the present paper is to invest these concepts with a new , and precise , meaning .    in the present paper",
    "an operator - based approach to quantising space , or space - time , structure is described .",
    "the ensuing theory is applicable to two types of physical situation .",
    "the first is ` canonical quantisation ' , where the states in the hilbert space refer to the situation at a fixed time .",
    "for example , in a theory of the quantisation of the topology @xmath9 of physical space , the states might be functions @xmath10 , or an extension thereof .",
    "such a theory would then need to be augmented with a ` hamiltonian ' operator to specify how these states evolve in ( possibly , a discrete ) time .    on the other hand , it is not appropriate to talk about the _",
    "canonical _ quantisation of causal sets since each causal set @xmath11 is a complete space - time in itself , and hence a state function @xmath12 has no physical meaning within the interpretative framework of standard quantum theory .",
    "however , states of this type _ are _ meaningful in a consistent - history approach to quantum theory .",
    "more precisely , in the ` hpo ' ( history projection operator ) method , propositions about complete histories of a system are represented by projection operators on a ` history hilbert space ' @xcite . in the case of causal sets",
    ", the propositions would include statements about the causal - set structure of space - time . in a theory of this type",
    ", the analogue of ` dynamics ' is coded into the decoherence functional that is to be constructed from the basic quantum operators in the history hilbert space .",
    "it is important to keep in mind these two different ways of using operators and hilbert spaces : ( i ) a canonical quantum theory , and ( ii ) the hpo approach to a consistent history theory .",
    "the general mathematical framework is the same in both cases , but the physical interpretation is quite different .    let us now consider in more detail the construction a quantum history theory of causal sets .",
    "a first guess might be that the history state vectors are functions @xmath12 , or some generalisation thereof .",
    "this sounds plausible , but how is it to be justified ; and what is the appropriate ` generalisation ' of a function @xmath13 of causal sets ?    in the canonical quantisation of , say , a particle moving in one dimension , the rationale for identifying states with wave functions in the hilbert space @xmath14 lies in the existence of operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 that are assumed to satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath17=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "it then follows from the famous theorem of stone and von neumann that any irreducible representation of this canonical algebra is unitarily equivalent to the familiar one on @xmath14 in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "more generally , consider a system whose configuration space is a finite - dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are lie groups .",
    "the analogue of the canonical commutation relations includes a representation of the lie algebra of @xmath3 , and the elements of this algebra are the momentum variables in the theory .",
    "the question arises , therefore , of whether there is analogue of momentum for causal sets . when @xmath2 , the lie group @xmath3 generates transformations from one point in @xmath20 to another , which leads us to consider how one causal set can be ` transformed ' into another .",
    "similarly , in quantum topology , we would seek a natural way of ` transforming ' from one topological space to another .    in the case of causal sets",
    ", one can imagine trying to remove , or add , points and links , but it is not easy to describe a general scheme for doing this . for example , removing a point ( and the associated links ) might result in a disconnected causal set .",
    "but suppose we do not wish to admit space - times of this type : what then ?",
    "similarly , adjoining a point to a causal set is not trivial since enough links must be also added to ensure that the resulting structure is a partially - ordered set , and this can be done in different ways .",
    "the key idea of the present paper is that , in the example of causal sets , what ` connects ' one causal set to another is the collection of all order - preserving maps between them .",
    "this suggests that to each such map @xmath22 there is to be associated an operator @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , if we have three causal sets @xmath24 , and order - preserving maps @xmath22 , and @xmath25 , then the composition @xmath26 is also order - preserving .",
    "it is natural to postulate that the operators @xmath23 reflect this structure by satisfying the relations @xmath27 or , perhaps , @xmath28 since , at this stage , there is no _ prima facie _ reason for preferring any particular ordering of the operators .",
    "note that in a scheme of this type it is easy to use just connected causal sets , if so desired .",
    "or we can require the causal sets to be finite ; or restrict our attention to order - preserving maps that are one - to - one ; or to any of a number of variants of the basic idea if there is some good physical reason for doing so .",
    "it is clear that a similar idea could be applied to topological spaces , with the analogue of order - preserving maps being continuous functions .",
    "these preliminary ideas could be developed into genuine quantisation schemes for causal sets and topological spaces .",
    "however , these particular examples admit a natural generalisation that applies to many different physical situations , and it is this generalisation that is described in the present paper .",
    "the application of this scheme to causal sets is discussed in a companion paper @xcite .    to motivate this generalisation , consider the example of , say , finite causal sets .",
    "the key remark is that these can be viewed as the _ objects _ of a category , whose arrows / morphisms are order - preserving maps .",
    "similarly , one can imagine forming a category whose objects are topological spaces of some specific physical interest , and whose arrows are continuous maps .    thus we are led to the following general problem .",
    "namely , to construct the quantum theory of a system whose ` configuration space ' ( or history analogue ) is the set of objects in some category @xmath1 , and in which the role of momentum transformations is played by the arrows in @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath29 is an arrow ( _ i.e. _ , the objects @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the domain and range of @xmath32 respectively ) , then we think of @xmath32 as providing a ( partial ) description of how to ` transform ' from @xmath30 to @xmath31 . in general",
    ", there will be many arrows from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , and we shall regard the set of all of them , denoted @xmath33 , as affording the complete description of how to transform from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "note that for this idea to be mathematically meaningful , the category @xmath1 must be ` small ' in the sense that the collection of all objects , @xmath0 , in @xmath1 , and the collection of all arrows , @xmath34 , in @xmath1 must be genuine sets , not classes .",
    "for example , the category of _ all _ sets is certainly not of this type .    to construct a quantum theory on a general small category",
    "@xmath1 we generalise what was said above for causal sets .",
    "thus we expect each arrow @xmath35 to be associated with an operator @xmath36 in such a way as to represent the law of arrow composition by the operator relations eq .",
    "( [ intro : main ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ intro : mainanti ] ) ) .",
    "if the objects in @xmath0 have a physically important internal structure  as manifested mathematically by the sets @xmath37 , @xmath38 , being non - trivial  this should be reflected in the quantum theory . in particular",
    ", we anticipate that the ( history ) state vectors are vector - space valued functions on @xmath0 , in analogy to what happens for a manifold @xmath2 where , generically , the states are cross - sections of a vector bundle over @xmath20 whose fibre carries a representation of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the construction of a quantum theory on @xmath1 involves a generalisation of the idea of vector - valued functions .",
    "a variety of physically interesting situations are special cases of this categorical scheme .",
    "for example :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is a category of finite ( perhaps connected ) causal sets interpreted as a history theory .",
    "another possibility is to use causal sets that are locally finite . or one could choose some ` master ' causal set @xmath39 and let @xmath1 be the category of all causal subsets of @xmath39 , with the arrows being the order - preserving embeddings of one causal set in another .",
    "@xmath1 is a small category of partially ordered sets interpreted canonically as the structure of physical space at a given ` time ' .",
    "@xmath1 is a small category of topological spaces .",
    "this gives a new approach to ` quantum topology ' : to be interpreted as a history theory if the objects represent space - time , and as a canonical theory if the objects represent space .",
    "could be a small category of locales ( in the context of topology without points ) whose arrows are localic maps . ]",
    "@xmath1 is a small category of differentiable manifolds , with the arrows being differentiable maps between manifolds , regarded as models of either space - time or space .",
    "a more bizarre example is to take @xmath1 to be a small category of groups , with the arrows being group homomorphisms .",
    "for example , perhaps the symmetry group of a unified field theory undergoes ` quantum fluctuations ' near the big bang singularity ?",
    "this certainly gives a novel interpretation to the idea of `` quantum group theory'':- ) 6 .",
    "in all the examples above , the category @xmath1 is a category of sets with structure , and the arrows are maps that preserve this structure .",
    "thus it is useful to look first at the case where @xmath1 is a small category of sets , and the arrows between two sets @xmath30 and @xmath31 are _ any _ functions from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "this is studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "an example of a category whose objects are _ not _ structured sets is a partially - ordered set ( poset ) @xmath40 .",
    "the objects of this category are the points in @xmath40 , and if @xmath5 , an arrow is defined to exist from @xmath7 to @xmath8 if and only if @xmath41 ( hence there can be at most one arrow between any two points / objects ) . in this case , the objects have no internal structure , and so the quantum theory should be relatively simple . + this example is useful for providing a mathematically simple illustration of the general scheme , and we shall discuss it in @xcite .",
    "however , it can not be interpreted as a theory of quantum space - time ( or space ) of the type in which we are interested since each possible space - time ( or space ) is represented by structureless point , but there is no obvious reason why such a system should be of any physical interest . ] .    at this point , however , it is important to observe that there is an obvious problem with imposing eq .",
    "( [ intro : main ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ intro : mainanti ] ) ) as it stands .",
    "namely , the composition @xmath42 is only defined if the range , @xmath43 , of @xmath32 is equal to the domain , @xmath44 , of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if @xmath29 , and @xmath46 , the composition @xmath47 is only defined if @xmath48 . on the other hand , the operator product @xmath49 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ intro : main ] ) ( or eq .  ( [ intro : mainanti ] ) ) is always defined , @xmath35 , are unbounded then these products may not exist .",
    "but that is not the point at issue here which applies even when the operators concerned are all bounded . ] .",
    "the resolution of this issue is one of the key steps in the quantum scheme .",
    "two approaches are suggested : the first involves a semigroup @xmath50 that is constructed from the arrows in @xmath1 ; the second , and preferred , method involves the idea of an ` arrow field ' .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "an initial approach to developing a quantum theory is discussed in section [ sec : quantisingwithsemq ] .",
    "the focus is placed on equipping the set of arrows @xmath34 of @xmath1 with a semigroup structure .",
    "we show how this semigroup , @xmath50 , generates transformations of the set of objects @xmath0 : as such , it constitutes our first attempt at finding an analogue of the group @xmath3 used in the quantisation of a system whose configuration space is a manifold @xmath2",
    ".    however , the construction of @xmath50 is rather coarse , involving as it does the ad hoc introduction of an element ` @xmath51 ' whose sole role is to serve as the value of @xmath47 when the range of @xmath32 does _ not _ equal the domain of @xmath45 .",
    "this is remedied in section [ sec : semigrouparrowfields ] by the introduction of the idea of an ` arrow field ' , defined to be an assignment to each object @xmath38 of an arrow whose domain is @xmath30 .",
    "the crucial property of the set @xmath52 of all arrow fields is that it has a natural semigroup structure without the need for additional , spurious elements .",
    "the action of the semigroup @xmath52 on @xmath0 is used in section [ sec : afqt ] to provide the foundation of the quantum scheme .",
    "we start in section [ subsec : basicalgebraqt ] with a simple approach in which the quantum states are complex - valued functions on @xmath0 .",
    "this suffices to construct the basic ` category quantisation monoid ' , each of whose faithful , irreducible representations is deemed to constitute a proper quantisation on @xmath1 .",
    "however , as it stands , this simple scheme is inadequate since the quantum operators do not distinguish arrows with the same domain and range .",
    "we solve this problem in section [ subsec : introducingmultiplier ] by generalising the state vectors to become vector - valued functions on the set of objects @xmath0 .",
    "it transpires that the vector space in which a function takes its values must vary from object to object , and each such ` multiplier ' representation is associated with a presheaf of hilbert spaces over @xmath0 .",
    "( however , no detailed language of presheaf theory is used in the present paper . )    the collection of basic quantum operators is completed in section [ subsec : adjointa(x ) ] with a computation of the adjoints of the operators @xmath53 that represent arrow fields @xmath54 . in section",
    "[ subsec : prodaxadagx ] , we compute the products @xmath55 and @xmath56 that might be expected to play an important role in specific applications of the quantum scheme . in section [ subsec : questionirreducibility ] there are a few preliminary remarks about the irreducibility of the representations we have constructed .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ sec : conclusions ] , which is mainly a list of problems for further research .",
    "the present paper , the first in a series , introduces the general theory of quantising on a category . in the second paper @xcite",
    ", the general theory is developed for the physically important case where @xmath1 is a category of sets . in @xcite",
    "we return to the general theory and present an alternative approach in which state vectors are complex - valued functions on arrows , rather than , as in the present paper , on objects .",
    "later papers in the series will describe further developments of some of the main ideas , and more concrete examples .",
    "the key problem identified above in the context of eq .",
    "( [ intro : main ] ) is that the composition @xmath47 of arrows is only defined if @xmath58 , whereas the operator product @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) is always defined . in other words ,",
    "the set @xmath34 of arrows is only a _ partial _ semigroup under the law of composing arrows , whereas the ( bounded ) operators on a hilbert space are a full semigroup under operator multiplication .    in this context , recall that a ( full ) _ semigroup _ is a non - empty set @xmath61 with a law of combination that is associative .",
    "thus @xmath62 for all @xmath63 . a semigroup with a unit element",
    "is called a _",
    "monoid_. in a monoid ( and unlike in a group ) elements may not have inverses .",
    "a _ partial semigroup _",
    "@xmath61 is a more general structure in which not all pairs of elements @xmath64 can be combined ; if a pair @xmath65 _ can _ be combined , they are said to be _",
    "compatible_. the associativity law eq .",
    "( [ assoclaw ] ) is now imposed only when it makes sense : _",
    "i.e. _ , when the different elements in eq .",
    "( [ assoclaw ] ) are compatible in the appropriate way .    for our purposes ,",
    "a key observation is that the equation eq .",
    "( [ intro : main ] ) , @xmath66 , _ would _ be well defined if the elements @xmath45 and @xmath32 belonged to a full semigroup rather than only to a partial one .",
    "thus , we start by considering if it is possible in general to convert a partial semigroup into a full semigroup .    one simple approach is to append an extra element @xmath51 to a partial semigroup @xmath61 , and then try to define a new combination law ` @xmath67 ' by @xmath68 and @xmath69 for all is an absorptive element . ]",
    "note that it follows from these definitions that if @xmath71 and @xmath72 are compatible elements of @xmath61 , then @xmath73 .",
    "the combination law ` @xmath67 ' defined by eqs .",
    "( [ def : amp][def : amp4 ] ) on the extended set @xmath74 has the serious failing that , in general , it is not associative .",
    "for example , consider @xmath63 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are not compatible .",
    "then , for all @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 . on the other hand",
    ", it could be that @xmath72 and @xmath11 _ are _ compatible , in which case @xmath77 . then , if @xmath71 is compatible with @xmath78 , which is possible , we have @xmath79 , and hence a failure of associativity",
    ".    however , this objection does not apply when the partial semigroup is the set of arrows in a category @xmath1 , with @xmath80 for @xmath81 . for @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "are not compatible if and only if @xmath82 .",
    "but if @xmath72 and @xmath11 are compatible , then @xmath83 , and since @xmath84 it follows that @xmath71 and @xmath85 are not compatible .    in conclusion",
    ", the partial semigroup @xmath34 of arrows in a small category @xmath1 can be given the structure of a full semigroup by augmenting the set @xmath34 with an additional element @xmath51 ( which is not given a domain or range ) , and then defining , for all @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 for all @xmath35 .",
    "this semigroup will be denoted @xmath50 .",
    "it does not have a unit element .-",
    "algebra over @xmath89 , denoted @xmath90 $ ] , whose elements are defined to be complex - valued functions on @xmath50 that vanish for all but a finite number of elements of @xmath50 @xcite . if @xmath91 $ ] , their product @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 . in the special case where the category @xmath1 is a partially - ordered set ,",
    "this reproduces the incidence algebra used by raptis and zapatrin in their work on discretising space - time topology @xcite @xcite @xcite . ]",
    "if a lie group @xmath3 acts on the left on a manifold @xmath20 then an elementary ( anti)-representation of @xmath3 is given on the vector space of complex - valued functions on @xmath20 by @xmath94 , and this can be used as a starting point for discussing the quantum theory of a system whose configuation space is @xmath20 ( for more details see section [ subsec : quantmanq ] ) .",
    "as anticipated in section [ sec : introduction ] , in the category case , a crucial idea is that the arrows in a category can be thought of as ` transforming ' one object into another , which suggests that perhaps @xmath34 can play the role of the group @xmath3 above .",
    "thus , if @xmath32 is an arrow such that @xmath29 , we define @xmath95 .",
    "however , this leaves open the question of how to define @xmath96 when @xmath97 . the simplest way ( although not the one we shall ultimately adopt ) is to augment the set @xmath0 with an additional element , denoted @xmath98 , and then to define the action of an arrow @xmath32 on the augmented set @xmath99 by @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this can be extended to an action of the semigroup @xmath50 by defining @xmath102 for all @xmath103 .",
    "it is easy to check that , for all @xmath104 , @xmath105 thus , by these means , we have defined a left action of the semigroup @xmath50 on the extended set of objects @xmath99 .",
    "this action can be used to give a first attempt at a quantum theory on @xmath1 .",
    "the simplest scheme is to choose state vectors to be complex - valued functions on @xmath99 and then to define operators @xmath23 by @xmath106 for all @xmath107 and @xmath103 .",
    "then , if @xmath104 , @xmath108 and so @xmath109 which is an ( anti)-representation of the semigroup @xmath50 .    one implication of eq .",
    "( [ def : df ] ) is that if @xmath35 but @xmath110 , then @xmath111 , and also @xmath112 for all @xmath103 . in fact , nothing of significance is lost if we forget the extra element @xmath98 in @xmath99 in the sense that we define the state vectors to be functions on @xmath0 only ( which is equivalent to setting @xmath113 ) : _ i.e. _ , we define for @xmath35 , @xmath114 and with @xmath115 for all @xmath38 .",
    "this scheme can be extended to include quantising ` configuration ' variables_i.e .",
    "_ , real - valued functions @xmath116 on @xmath0by defining @xmath117 for any @xmath118 .    by these means",
    "we obtain a simple quantum model .",
    "but , several significant problems can be seen already .",
    "for example , no inner product has been specified on the state functions ; we shall discuss this question shortly .",
    "however , the main problem is that this representation of @xmath50 fails to separate arrows with the same domain and range .",
    "this is because if @xmath32 and @xmath45 are two such arrows then the action of @xmath50 on @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ def : taufa ] ) is such that @xmath119 for all @xmath103 .",
    "this problem could be addressed using similar methods to those adopted later in the context of arrow fields .",
    "however , we will not follow this path here since , anyway , the definition eq .",
    "( [ def : df ] ) , or eq .  ( [ def : df2 ] ) , of the operator @xmath23 has some peculiar features . in particular",
    ", @xmath23 annihilates any function whose support lies in the complement of the singleton set @xmath120 , which is rather draconian .",
    "it seems more natural to define an operator @xmath121 which leaves the values of @xmath13 unchanged except on the object @xmath122 on which the arrow @xmath32 naturally acts .",
    "this would correspond to an action of @xmath34 on @xmath0 @xmath123 in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ def : taufa ] ) .    however , the operators defined by eq .",
    "( [ def : afposs ] ) do not combine into themselves .",
    "for example , let @xmath29 and @xmath46 be arrows with @xmath124 and @xmath125 . then @xmath126",
    "but this is not of the form @xmath127 for any arrow @xmath128 .",
    "the problem lies in the definition eq .",
    "( [ defamp2 ] ) of the combination law on @xmath50 whereby the partial semigroup @xmath34 is transformed into a full semigroup .",
    "the introduction of the additional element @xmath51 is a rather crude device , and distinctly ad hoc .",
    "as we shall now see , there is a far more elegant way of associating a full semigroup with the set of arrows @xmath34 , and it is within this framework that the quantisation scheme will be developed further .",
    "the constructions used above are very ` local ' in object space .",
    "for example , when @xmath129 acts on @xmath99 , the only object that is affected is @xmath122 : the rest are mapped to the ` dustbin ' element @xmath51 that is appended to @xmath0 . on the other hand , in the motivating case of a group @xmath3 that acts on a manifold @xmath20 , each element @xmath130 acts on every element @xmath8 of @xmath20 ( of course , this includes the case where @xmath45 leaves @xmath8 fixed ) , without the need to append anything to @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that it would be profitable to drop the use of @xmath51 , and to seek an alternative structure that better resembles the typical action of a group on a manifold .",
    "we shall do this by choosing for _ each _ object @xmath30 an arrow whose domain is @xmath30 ( this could be the identity arrow @xmath131 ) , and then act on @xmath30 with it . thus we consider maps @xmath132 such that , for each @xmath38 , the domain can be viewed as a cross - section of a bundle on @xmath0 whose fibre over @xmath38 is the set of all arrows whose domain is @xmath30 . ] of @xmath133 is @xmath30 ; thus @xmath134 for some @xmath135 .",

    "is that they form a full monoid without needing to append any additional elements .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath137 and @xmath138 are arrow fields , we construct an arrow field @xmath139 by defining , for all @xmath38 , the arrow @xmath140 to be the composition of the arrow @xmath141 with the arrow obtained by evaluating @xmath138 on the range of @xmath141 : @xmath142 put more simply , if @xmath143 , then @xmath144 as summarised in the diagram @xmath145 .    to prove associativity , it is helpful to use the diagram @xmath146 then @xmath147(a)$ ] is the arrow from @xmath30 to @xmath148 given by @xmath149(a)&=&x_3[{{\\rm ran}\\;(x_2\\&x_1)(a)}]\\circ                          ( x_2\\&x_1)(a )        \\nonumber\\\\      & = & x_3(c)\\circ ( x_2\\&x_1)(a )             \\nonumber\\\\      & = & x_3(c)\\circ[x_2(b)\\circ x_1(a)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath38 . on the other hand @xmath150(a)&=&(x_3\\&x_2)(b)\\circ x_1(a)\\nonumber\\\\              & = & [ x_3(c)\\circ x_2(b)]\\circ x_1(a)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath38 .",

    "it remains a task for the future to determine a complete representation theory for the case of a general small category @xmath1 ; if , indeed , this is possible .",

    "this , at least , should have an analogue in the category case , and so a natural question is whether @xmath0 is a single orbit under the action of @xmath52 .",
    "the concept of an ` orbit ' is more subtle for an action of a semigroup on a set than it is for a group , and a fuller discussion of this issue is deferred to a later paper in this series .",

    "all the physical examples we have mentioned so far have this property . however , connectedness alone is certainly not sufficient to guarantee irreducibility , and we will return to this issue later .",
    "we have seen how to construct a quantum scheme for a system whose configuration space ( or history equivalent ) is the set of object @xmath0 in a small category @xmath1 .",
    "a key ingredient is the monoid @xmath52 of arrow fields and its action on @xmath0 .",
    "multiplier representations are needed to distinguish quantum theoretically between arrows with the same range and domain .",
    "each such representation can be expressed in terms of a presheaf of hilbert spaces over @xmath0 .",
    "the material in the present paper is only an introduction to what needs to be done to construct a complete representation theory of a category quantisation monoid .",
    "many topics remain for further research , some of the most important of which are the following .    1 .   a general question is how much the theory can be developed in terms of an arbitrary small category @xmath1 , and how much will need to rely on the special properties of particular categories of physical interest .",
    "2 .   it would be good to determine some general way of specifying the hilbert spaces @xmath292 $ ] , @xmath38 , such that the ensuing representation of the category quantisation monoid is both faithful and irreducible . at the very least ,",
    "this is likely to require a proper study of the meaning , and role , of an orbit of the monoid @xmath52 as it acts on the set @xmath0 .",
    "however , it may be that a full discussion of irreducibility can only be given in the context of a case - by - case study with specific categories @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   the classification of inequivalent irreducible representations of the category quantisation monoid will involve the choice of a presheaf of hilbert spaces , and the choice of the measure @xmath198 used in the inner product in eq .",
    "( [ def : innerproduct ] ) .",
    "it is necessary therefore to develop a proper measure theory on the set @xmath0 . whether this is feasible for a general small category @xmath1 is unclear , but even if it is , it seems likely that the construction of the physically relevant measures will depend on the details of the category . for example , brightwell et al",
    "have recently developed a particular measure theory on a space of causal sets @xcite @xcite .",
    "this was carried out in the context of constructing a classical stochastic theory of causal sets , but perhaps these are also the correct measures to use in the quantum theory as developed in the present paper ? 4 .   the quantisation of a system whose configuration space is a manifold @xmath2 , uses only the finite - dimensional subgroup @xmath3 of the group of all diffeomorphisms , @xmath195 , and the question arises therefore if , in the category case , there is some submonoid of @xmath52 that still acts ` transitively ' on @xmath0 and which would be a more appropriate entity to use in the category quantisation monoid .",
    "the answer is likely to depend strongly on the details of the category @xmath1 .",
    "5 .   in the standard quantum theory of a system",
    "whose configuration space is an _",
    "infinite _ dimensional topological vector space @xmath432 ( for example , in a quantum field theory ) , the state vectors are typically functions on the _ topological dual _ of @xmath432 rather than on @xmath432 itself .",
    "this is closely connected to the theory of measures on spaces of this type . +",
    "this raises the intriguing question of whether something like this could happen when quantising on a category @xmath1 . in other words , are there situations in which an analogue of the topological dual is needed ; and what is the ` dual ' of the set of objects @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer is likely to be closely linked with the problem of constructing suitable measures on @xmath0 .",
    "it is also related to the issue of whether the quantum scheme should involve only some linear subspace of the set of all real - valued functions on @xmath0 .",
    "this would be an analogue of the use of @xmath212 when @xmath2 .    when applied to categories of space - times ( or spaces ) the scheme described above deals with the quantum states of those structures only .",
    "however , in practice , there will be other degrees of freedom too ( for example , matter fields ) , and these need to be incorporated at some point .",
    "this could be done by exploiting whatever is known already about the quantisation of these extra degrees of freedom , and adjusting the hilbert spaces @xmath292 $ ] , @xmath38 , accordingly .",
    "the representation of the category quantisation monoid will then no longer be irreducible because of the presence of these extra modes .    however , it may be possible to include any extra degrees of freedom strictly within the category quantisation scheme by changing the category @xmath1 to get an appropriately extended category quantisation monoid .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is a category of topological spaces , then one might replace the objects ( topological spaces ) with the spaces of continuous functions on them , with appropriate modifications of the arrows .",
    "this would give a type of quantum field theory on a space that is itself quantised .",
    "note that , if @xmath1 is a category of manifolds , additional degrees of freedom could include quantised metric fields .",
    "for example , it would be possible to construct a canonical theory of quantum gravity ( in either the traditional formalism , or in the newer scheme based on loop variables ) in which the spatial 3-manifold is itself subject to ` quantum fluctuations ' .",
    "the analogue in a history theory would be to quantise lorentzian metrics on a quantised background space - time manifold . or",
    "the techniques could be applied to give a version of string theory in which the manifold in which the strings , or @xmath194-branes , propagate is itself the subject of quantum effects .",
    "finally , note that , when discussing the quantum theory of causal sets , i have assumed that the space @xmath433 $ ] associated with each causal set @xmath11 is a standard hilbert space , in accordance with normal quantum theory .",
    "however , in @xcite it is argued that normal quantum theory is problematic in such a situation because the use of the continuum real and complex numbers assumes _ a priori _ that the background space and space - time are manifolds , which is not the case if the space - time is a causal set .",
    "this suggests that each @xmath433 $ ] should be replaced by something quite different : in fact , by whatever the analogue is for that specific causal set @xmath11 of the hilbert space of states in normal quantum theory .",
    "it is a task for future research to decide what this may be , but once the decision is made , the techniques described in the present paper would be a good starting point to construct a theory in which the causal sets , and the associated quantum theories , are themselves subject to ` quantum fluctuations ' .",
    "these projects are exciting , but it should be emphasised that what is described in the present paper is only a ` tool - kit ' for constructing operator - based models of quantum space - time or space : it needs a creative leap to use these tools to construct a physically realistic model of , for example , quantum causal sets .",
    "the key step would be to choose a decoherence functional for the quantum history theory .",
    "this decoherence functional would be constructed from the operators described in this paper , but new physical principles are needed to decide its precise form .",
