    "consider the problem of finding a point in the intersection of a finite family of closed convex subsets of a hilbert space ; a problem often referred to as the _ convex feasibility problem _ which arises frequently throughout areas of mathematics , science and engineering . for details , we refer the reader to the surveys @xcite , the monographs @xcite , any of @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "one approach to solving convex feasibility problems involves designing a nonexpansive operator whose fixed point set can be used to easily produce a point in the target intersection ( in the simplest case , the fixed point set coincides with the target intersection ) .",
    "the operator s fixed point iteration can then be used as the basis of an iterative algorithm which , in the limit , yields the desired solution . an important class of such methods comprises the so - called _ projection and reflection methods _ which employ various combinations of _ projection _ and _ reflection _ operations with respect to underlying constraint sets .",
    "notable methods of this kind include the _ _ alternating projection algorithm__@xcite , the _ douglas  rachford ( dr ) algorithm _",
    "@xcite , and many extensions and variants @xcite . even in settings without convexity @xcite ,",
    "such methods remain a popular choice due largely to their simplicity , ease - of - implementation and relatively  often surprisingly  good performance .",
    "the origins of the douglas  rachford ( dr ) algorithm can be traced to @xcite where it was used to solve problems arising in nonlinear heat flow . in its full generality",
    ", the method finds zeros of the sum of two maximal monotone operators .",
    "weak convergence of the scheme was originally proven by lions and mercier @xcite , and the result was recently strengthened by svaiter @xcite .",
    "specialized to feasibility problems , svaiter s result implies that the iterates generated by the dr algorithm are always weakly convergent , and that the _ shadow sequence _ converges weakly to a point in the intersection of the two closed convex sets .",
    "the scheme has also been examined in @xcite where its relationship with another popular method , the _ proximal point algorithm _ , was discussed .    motivated by the computational observation that the douglas  rachford algorithm sometimes outperforms other projection methods , in the convex case",
    "many researchers have studied the actual convergence rate of the algorithm . by _",
    "convergence rate _",
    ", we mean how _ fast _ the sequences generated by the algorithm converges to their limit points .",
    "for the douglas  rachford algorithm , the first such result , which appeared in @xcite and was later extended by @xcite , showed the algorithm to converge linearly whenever the two constraint sets are closed subspaces with a closed sum , and , further , that the rate is governed exactly by the cosine of the _ friedrichs angle _ between the subspaces . in finite dimensions , if the sum of the two subspaces is not closed , convergence of the method  while still assured  need not be linear ( * ? ? ?",
    "see also @xcite for other recent work regarding linear convergence . for most projection methods ,",
    "it is typical that there exists instances in which the rate of convergence is arbitrarily slow and not even sublinear or arithmetic @xcite .",
    "most recently , a preprint of davis and yin shows that indeed the douglas  rachford method also may converge arbitrarily slowly in infinite dimensions ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 ) .    in potentially nonconvex settings ,",
    "a number of recent works @xcite have established local linear convergence rates for the dr algorithm using commonly used constraint qualifications . when specialized to the convex case , these results state that the dr algorithm exhibits locally linear convergence for convex feasibility problems in a finite dimensional space whenever the relative interiors of the two convex sets have a non - empty intersection . on the other hand ,",
    "when such a regularity condition is not satisfied , the dr algorithm can fail to exhibit linear convergence , even in simple two dimensional cases as observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.4(iii ) ) ( see section  [ sec : examples ] for further examples and discussion ) .",
    "this situation therefore calls for further research aimed at answering the question : _ can a global convergence rate for the dr algorithm and its variants be established or estimated for some reasonable class of convex sets without the above mentioned regularity condition ? _",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide some partial answers to the above question , as well as giving simple tools for establishing sublinear or linear convergence of the douglas  rachford algorithm and variants .",
    "our analysis is performed within the much more general setting of _ fixed point iterations _ described by _ averaged nonexpansive operators_. this broad framework covers many iterative fixed - point methods including various krasnoselskii ",
    "mann iterations , the cyclic projection algorithm , douglas  rachford algorithms and forward - backward splitting methods , and can be used to solve not only convex feasibility problems but also convex optimization problems and variational inequality problems .",
    "we pay special attention to the case in which the underlying sets are _ convex semi - algebraic sets _ in a finite dimensional space .",
    "such sets comprise a broad sub - class of convex sets that we shall show satisfy _",
    "hlder regularity properties _ without requiring any further assumptions .",
    "indeed , they capture all polyhedra and convex sets described by convex quadratic functions . furthermore , convex semi - algebraic structure can often be relatively easily identified .",
    "the detailed contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    a.   we study an abstract algorithm which we refer to as the _ quasi - cyclic algorithm_. this algorithm covers many iterative fixed - point methods including various krasnoselskii ",
    "mann iterations , the cyclic projection algorithm , douglas  rachford algorithms and forward - backward splitting methods . in the presence of",
    "so - called _ bounded hlder regularity properties _ , sublinear convergence of the algorithm is then established ( theorem  [ thm : abstract convergence rate ] ) .",
    "b.   the quasi - cyclic algorithm framework is then specialized to the douglas  rachford algorithm and its variants ( section  [ sec : dr ] ) .",
    "we show the results apply , for instance , to the important case of feasibility problems for which the underlying sets are convex semi - algebraic in a finite dimensional space . c.   a damped variant of the douglas ",
    "rachford algorithm is examined .",
    "again , in the case in which the underlying sets are convex basic semi - algebraic sets in a finite dimensional space , we obtain a more _ explicit estimate of the sublinear convergence rate _ in terms of the dimension of the underlying space and the maximum degree of the polynomials involved ( theorem  [ themtr:3 ] ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we recall definitions and key facts used in our analysis . in section  [ sec : averaged ] we investigate the rate of convergence of the _ quasi - cyclic algorithm_. in section  [ sec : dr ] we specialize these results to the classical douglas  rachford algorithm and its cyclic variants . in section  [ sec : damped dr ] we consider a damped version of the douglas  rachford algorithm . in section",
