    "mankind has admired the sky with its milky way , stars , planets , moons and the sun , the meteors and the northern light . in the age of satellites",
    "we map the sky through all electromagnetic frequencies and also through high energy cosmic particles .",
    "gravitational waves are the last great frontier to be reached and passed for the search for our physical understanding of the universe via the messengers reaching us with the speed of light or very close to it :    gravitational waves , these fleeting distortions of space , the signature of accelerating masses in the universe , remain to be discovered .",
    "therefore it is of paramount importance to understand , which objects are about to generate strong gravitational waves .    when the black holes residing in the centers of almost all galaxies merge , following the merger of their host galaxies , relatively strong gravitation waves are emitted and various aspects of this process were already investigated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a recent review of the generic aspects of these galaxies nuclei as sources for ultra high energy cosmic rays is in @xcite .",
    "starting from the broken powerlaw mass distribution of galactic central black holes @xcite-@xcite , with simple assumptions on the cross section and relative velocity of the two galaxies , we have shown @xcite that the most likely mass ratio @xmath1 of the merging black holes is between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , thus a typical value will be at about@xmath4 . within this range of mass ratios the key stages of the evolution leading to and following the merger",
    "can all be treated with post - newtonian ( pn ) approximations .",
    "a numerical analysis of such mass ratios was recently presented in @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we describe the sequence of events which will accompany the merger of two supermassive galactic black holes .",
    "then from section 3 we concentrate on the gravitational radiation dominated dissipative regime .",
    "an important quantity in gravitational wave detection is the _ number of cycles spent in the frequency range of the detector_. this quantity is proportional to the _ accumulated orbital phase _ ( the total angle covered by the quasi - circular orbital evolution ) .",
    "the gravitational waves emerging from this process carry the imprint of the physical characteristics ( finite size ) of the black holes , like their spins and quadrupole moments .",
    "spin precessions allow for increased accuracy and degeneracy breaking among the parameters characterizing the source @xcite .",
    "we remark that according to @xcite , the mass quadrupole - mass monopole coupling for maximally rotating black holes ( with quadrupole moment originating entirely in their rotation ) gives rise to contributions in the accumulated orbital phase larger by a half to one order of magnitude than the spin - spin contribution , at least for the typical unequal mass ratios .",
    "therefore for a successful detection this qualifies as the second most important finite mass contribution to be considered , after the spin - orbit effect .    in section 3",
    "we discuss the effect of the quasi - precessional evolution of the spins on the accumulated phase of the gravitational waves and we present estimates of the pn order in which various finite size contributions to the change in the relative configurations of the spins and orbital angular momentum contribute .",
    "the cumbersome equations leading to these estimates are presented in the appendix .",
    "sections 4 and 5 explore a convenient analytical way to encompass the effect of spin and quadrupolar quasi - precessions even at a lower level accuracy . the leading order contribution to the spin - spin ( section 4 ) and spin - orbit ( section 5 ) contributions to the accumulated orbital phase",
    "are discussed both for the equal mass and unequal mass cases in distinct subsections .",
    "we summarize our findings in the concluding remarks .",
    "first the dance : two galaxies with central black holes approach each other to within a distance where dynamical friction keeps them bound , spiraling into each other . in the case when both galaxies with their central black holes were radio galaxies ,",
    "their jets get distorted and form the z - shape @xcite : the radio emitting blobs and tails produce the appearance of dancing veils .",
    "second the meeting of the eyes : the central regions in each galaxy begin to act as one unit , in a sea of stars and dark matter of the other galaxy . during this phase ,",
    "the central region can be stirred up , and produce a nuclear starburst .",
    "third the lock : the black holes begin to lose orbital angular momentum due to the interaction with the nearby stars @xcite , and next by gravitational radiation .",
    "the spin axes tumble and precess .",
    "this phase can be identified with the apparent superdisk , as the rapidly precessing jet produces the hydrodynamic equivalent of a powerful wind , by entraining the ambient hot gas , pushing the two radio lobes apart and so giving rise the a broad separation @xcite . due to the combined effect of precessions and orbital angular momentum dissipation by gravitational waves the spin ( and hence jet ) direction of the dominant black hole",
    "is reoriented approximately in the direction of the original orbital angular momentum , leading to a spin - flip @xcite .",
    "fourth the plunge : the two black holes actually merge , with not much angular orbital momentum left to be radiated away , thus the direction of the spin remained basically unchanged ( in the case of the typical mass ratio range we discuss ; for other setups the final spin may vary @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the final stage in this merger leads to a rapid increase in the frequency of the gravitational waves , called chirping \" , but this chirping will depend on the angles involved .",
    "fifth the rejuvenation : now the newly oriented more massive merged black hole starts its accretion disk and jet anew , boring a new hole for the jets through its environment ( the gigahertz peaked sources ) . in this stage",
    "the newly active jet is boring through the interstellar clouds with a gigantic system of shockwaves , that accelerate protons and other charged particles in a relativistic tennis - game .",
    "these very energetic particles then interact in those same clouds , that slow down the progression of the relativistic jet , and can so give rise to an abundance of neutrinos , tev photons from pion decay , and yet other particles and photons .",
    "these particles and their interactions reach energies far beyond any earth - bound accelerator .",
    "sixth the phoenix : the newly oriented jets begin to show up over some kpc , and this corresponds to the x - shaped radio galaxies , while the old jets are fading but still visible @xcite .",
    "this also explains many of the compact steep spectrum sources , with disjoint directions for the inner and outer jets .",
    "seventh the cocoon : the old jets have faded , and are at most visible in the low radio frequency bubbly structures , such as seen for the virgo cluster region around m87 .",
    "the feeding is slowing down , while a powerful jet is still there , fed from the spin of the black hole .",
    "the wait : the feeding of the black hole is down to catching some gas out of a common red giant star wind as presumably is happening in our galactic center .",
    "this stage seems to exist for all black holes , even at very low levels of activity .",
    "this black hole and its galaxy are ready for the next merger , with the next black hole suitor , which may or may not come .",
    "we predict that the super - disk radio galaxies should have large outer distortions in their radio images , and should be visible in low kev x - rays . a detection of the precessing jet , and its sudden weakening ,",
    "would then immediately precede the actual merger of the two black holes , and so may be a predictor of the gravitational wave signal .",
    "in the rest of the paper we concentrate on the gravitational radiation dominated dissipative regime , when the supermassive black hole binary radiates away gravitational waves .    if the binary system evolves unperturbed , the orbit circularizes faster than it shrinks in radius .",
    "therefore we consider circular orbits for which the wave frequency is twice the orbital frequency .",
    "besides the keplerian contribution to the accumulated orbital phase there are general relativistic contributions , which scale with the post - newtonian ( pn ) parameter @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 the total mass and @xmath7 the radius of the reduced mass orbit about the total mass ; we take @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is generally agreed from comparison with numerical evolution , that all contributions up to 3.5 pn  orders have to be taken into account . to this order , beside the general relativistic contributions starting at 1pn",
    ", there are various contributions originating in the finite size of the binary components .",
    "these are related either to their rotation ( spin ) or to their irregularities in shape ( like a mass quadrupole moment ) .    due to the continued accretion of surrounding matter into the supermassive galactic black holes they spin up considerably . by taking into account only the angular momentum transfer from accreting matter , the dimensionless spin parameters @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 )",
    "grow to the maximally allowed value @xmath11 even for initially non - rotating black holes @xcite . by taking into account the torque produced by the energy input of the in - falling ( horizon - crossing ) photons emitted from the steady - state thin accretion disk , which counteracts the torque due to mass accretion",
    ", the limiting value of the dimensionless spin parameter is slightly reduced to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "various refinements of this process , with the inclusion of open or closed magnetic field lines @xcite-@xcite , also jets in the magnetosphere of the hole jetdisksymbiosys-@xcite have not changed essentially this prediction .",
    "therefore we assume for the present considerations maximal rotation @xmath13",
    ". due to this rotation the black hole is centrifugally flattened ( it becomes an oblate spheroid ) , a deformation which can be characterized by a mass quadrupole scalar @xmath14 @xcite , or its dimensionless counterpart @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the accumulated orbital phase can be formally given as the pn expansion renormsigma , @xcite , @xcite@xmath17spin - orbit ( so ) contributions appear at 1.5 pn , spin - spin ( ss ; composed of proper s@xmath18s@xmath19 and self - contributions s@xmath20 and s@xmath21 ) and mass quadrupole - mass monopole coupling ( qm ) contributions at 2pn .",
    "they come with various pn corrections ( pnso at 2.5 pn ; pnss , pnqm and so@xmath22 at 3pn ; finally 2pnso at 3.5 pn ; these were not computed yet with the exception of pnso @xcite-@xcite ) . at 3pn",
    "there are additional spin and quadrupole contributions , originating in the quasi - precessional evolution of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "the number of gravitational wave cycles @xmath23 can be computed from the accumulated orbital phase as @xmath24 ( the gravitational wave frequency being twice the orbital frequency for quasi - circular motion ) .",
    "the spin precession equations with so , ss and qm contributions were given by barker and oconnell @xcite .",
    "the relative geometry of the two spins @xmath25 and orbital angular momentum @xmath26 can be best described by the angles @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( an overhat denotes the direction of the respective vector ) .",
    "these angles are related by the the spherical cosine identity@xmath29with @xmath30 the relative azimuthal angle of the spins . due to quasi - precessions ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 evolve .",

    "from among the quasi - precessional evolutions , we have recently integrated @xcite the so evolution ( averaged over one orbit ) of the angle @xmath45 , finding@xmath46here  @xmath47 the reduced mass , @xmath48 the radius and @xmath49 . the time - dependent expression for @xmath32",
