    "magnetic reconnection is believed to be the dominant energy release mechanism during solar flares .",
    "early observations of flares have led to the development of the standard flare model , in which the frequently observed h@xmath2  ribbons , post - flare loops , hard x - ray sources at the loop footpoints and the loop top can be explained as consequences of magnetic reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after the mid-1990s , high - resolution observations at multiple wavelengths have greatly enhanced our understanding of the reconnecting current sheets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and chromospheric evaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are also part of the standard flare model . for recent reviews of theories and observations of magnetic reconnection in solar flares",
    ", we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there have been observations of plasma inflows in flare reconnections ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "upward outflows are often identified as impulsive ejection of plasmoids .",
    "high - speed downflows immediately above the post - eruption flare arcades ( supra arcade downflows ) were first presented by @xcite , but their nature is subject to debate @xcite .",
    "shrinking loops have been seen in several imaging observations @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of fast reconnection outflows @xcite , especially the downflows , are extremely rare .",
    "we report the first detection of a large redshift in fe  1354.08 ( formation temperature @xmath010 mk ) with the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a c1.6 flare peaked at 17:19 ut on 2014 april 19 .",
    "based on observations of iris , the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , and the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we interpret this large redshift as the reconnection downflow .",
    "greatly blueshifted fe  features have also been detected in the evaporation flow .",
    "furthermore , inflows , upward - moving outflows , and fast downward - moving blobs have all been detected .",
    "thus , rather than fragmented pieces of the evidences of reconnection identified in many previous flare observations , our observations provide a more complete picture of flare reconnection .",
    "the iris observation was taken from 15:09 ut to 22:20 ut on 2014 april 19 .",
    "there were several large coarse 64-step rasters in this observation and the flare of interest ( sol2014 - 04 - 19t17:19 ut ) was observed in the fourth raster .",
    "the pointing coordinate was ( 695@xmath3 , -221@xmath3 ) . the data was summed by 2 onboard both spectrally and spatially , leading to a spatial pixel size of 0.33@xmath3 and a spectral dispersion of @xmath00.026  per pixel in the far ultraviolet wavelength bands .",
    "the cadence of the spectral observation was 31 seconds , with an exposure time of 30 seconds .",
    "slit - jaw images ( sji ) in the 1400 filter were taken at a cadence of 31 seconds .",
    "dark current subtraction , flat field and geometrical corrections have been applied in the level 2 data used here .",
    "the fiducial lines were used to achieve a coalignment between the sji and different spectral windows .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] shows some context images taken by iris and aia .",
    "emission in the iris / sji 1400 filter is dominated by the strong si  1393.76/1402.77  lines ( formed around 10@xmath4k ) and uv continuum ( formed slightly above the temperature minimum , * ? ? ?",
    "the aia 1600  images and sji 1400  images are used for the coalignment of the images taken by the two instruments . the emission pattern and plasma motions are similar in the aia 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , 304 and 1600 passbands .",
    "we thus only present the 211  images here .",
    "this passband is dominated by emission from ions formed at both coronal ( fe  ) and transition region ( e.g. , o  , o  ) temperatures @xcite .",
    "the two hot aia passbands , 131 and 94 , sample emission mainly from the 10 mk and 6 mk plasma respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig.2][fig.4 ] present the iris / sji 1400 images , corresponding aia 131 images , and the iris spectra in the fe  1354.08  and si  1402.77  windows at three different times .",
    "we present the time sequence of iris observation ( including sji 1400 images and several spectral windows ) and the corresponding aia images in an online movie .",
    "the full - cadence ( 12 seconds ) movie of aia 211 is also available online .    from the online movies we can see that the flare loops brightened at @xmath017:13:20 , @xmath017:15:55 and @xmath017:17:30 before the flare peak ( @xmath017:19:00 ) , suggesting a multiple - episode energy release behavior of this flare .",
    "in this paper we mainly focus on various types of flows observed in the third episode starting from @xmath017:17:30 , which were clearly observed from both imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "observations of iris / sji 1400  and aia 211 ( figure  [ fig.1 ] ) reveal a process consistent with the flare reconnection scenario .",
    "sides of loops moved towards each other from 17:18:11 to 17:19:35 .",
    "a bright structure ( the ejecta marked in figure  [ fig.1](a ) , presumably a flux rope or plasmoid ) can be identified near the coordinates ( 755@xmath3 , -185@xmath3 ) around 17:18:32 .",
    "its disappearance at 17:19:03 is likely related to magnetic reconnection , which permits the field reconfiguration that allows the structure to be expelled . at 17:19:35 a linear bright structure ( figure  [ fig.1](d ) ) above the post - reconnection loops in the 1400  and 211  images can be seen .",
    "this resembles the tip of newly formed loops ( cusp ) .",
    "it could also be the lower end of the current sheet .    by plotting the space - time map of aia  211 ( figure  [ fig.1](g ) ) along cut 1 ( figure  [ fig.1](e ) )",
    "we have inferred the speed of reconnection inflow from the movement of the southern part of the reconnecting loops and found a value of @xmath040  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "inflow at the northern part is not obvious , probably due to projection effect or asymmetric reconnection inflows .",
    "propagation of the ejecta is barely visible after the eruption , but we do find a bright outward moving feature from aia  211 ( figure  [ fig.1](e ) , cut 2 ) .",
    "this feature seems to be located at the southern boundary of the ejected structure and its speed is estimated to be @xmath090  km  s@xmath1 ( figure  [ fig.1](h ) ) , likely the lower end of the speed of the upward - moving reconnection outflow .",
    "there are several neutral and singly ionized lines in the spectral windows shown in figures  [ fig.2][fig.4 ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , most of these lines are only visible at the loop footpoints ( e.g. , location 2 in figure  [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the major blend of the fe  1354.08 line is c  1354.288 , which is usually strong even outside the flare regions ( e.g. , location 1 in figure  [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "significant enhancement at the red side of the fe  1354.08  rest position can be identified at the bright linear structure around 17:19:35 ( figure  [ fig.3 ] , location 1 ) . clearly , this emission feature can not be explained by the two narrow fe  lines marked in figure  [ fig.2](e ) .",
    "this enhancement is due to the greatly redshifted fe  1354.08  emission .",
    "the aia 131  passband also mainly samples emission from the fe  ion and we clearly see a very bright emission feature at location 1 , supporting our argument that this enhancement is caused by the fe  emission .",
    "the enhanced emission extends to the nearby o  line , suggesting redshift of fe  by up to @xmath0300  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "images of sji 1400  and aia 131  suggest that location 1 is probably at the lower end of a current sheet or close to the cusp of the newly reconnected hot loops .",
    "so the large redshift of fe   is most likely a signature of the downward - moving reconnection outflow or hot retracting loops .",
    "the main blend of the o  1399.774  line is fe  1399.962 .",
    "the main blend of the o  1401.156  line is s  1401.514 .",
    "we take the ratio of the intensities of the two o  lines derived from multiple gaussian fit and obtain a density around log ( _ n_@xmath5/@xmath6)=11.0 at location 1 based on chianti v7.1 @xcite .    at 17:20:06",
    "the slit moved to the west and similar spectral features persisted ( figure  [ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "the greatly redshifted fe  emission at location 1 became much stronger at this time . applying a double gaussian fit to this broad fe  feature and the embedded c  emission feature yields a centroid redshift of @xmath0125  km  s@xmath1 and a nonthermal width ( 1/e width ) of @xmath096  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the nonthermal width is calculated based on an assumed kinetic temperature of 10 mk ( @xmath054  km  s@xmath1 thermal broadening ) .",
    "after 17:20:06 , the fe  downflow became weaker and the velocity decreased .",
    "presumably , the reconnection site moved to a higher height and the reconnection also weakened over time . at about 17:21:39 the centroid of the fe  line profile still had a redshift of @xmath050  km  s@xmath1 and the location of this hot downflow seems to coincide with the loop - top x - ray source observed with rhessi ( figure  [ fig.5](a)-(b ) ) .",
    "unfortunately rhessi was in orbit night before 17:21:30 .",
    "the large redshift of fe  is probably the first unambiguous detection of hotter - than-10 mk reconnection downflow / hot retracting loops in flares using combined imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite detected significant enhancement in both wings of an fe  line and interpreted them as reconnection outflows in a flare .",
    "the fe  line is mainly sensitive to @xmath08 mk plasma .",
    "@xcite observed a loop - top hot source in the fe   and fe   lines formed at @xmath012 mk .",
    "but these lines exhibited a redshift of only @xmath030  km  s@xmath1 , making it difficult to properly interpret .",
    "@xcite detected enhanced blue wing emission of fe  indicative of plasma flows up to @xmath01000  km  s@xmath1 in a limb flare , and provided the sunward reconnection outflow as one of the three possible explanations .",
    "the standard flare model also includes a termination shock ( ts ) resulting from the interaction between the reconnection downflow and the flare loops .",
    "the ts may play a crucial role in electron acceleration and the hardening of the flare spectra above @xmath0300 kev @xcite . @xcite and @xcite interpreted type - ii radio bursts without frequency drift as a signature of the ts .",
    "direct evidences of the ts should include a velocity discontinuity , which could potentially be observed by iris . in our event ,",
    "no clues about the ts can be obtained since we have only observed one redshift .",
    "note that the fe  spectral window used in our observation extends only to @xmath0360  km  s@xmath1 on the red side of fe  , so downflows with speeds higher than @xmath0360  km  s@xmath1 could not be detected .",
    "future iris observations with a more appropriate choice of the spectral window will be helpful to detect ts .",
    "the co - spatial redshifted fe  feature and the rhessi soft x - ray source suggest electron heating in the reconnection outflow / hot retracting loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or at the ts @xcite .",
    "the large nonthermal width of fe  could be caused by the divergence of flows along the line of sight above the loop tops , or post - reconnection turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboad the fermi gamma - ray space telescope reveal an enhancement of hard x - rays up to 30 - 50 kev around 17:17:45 ( figure  [ fig.5](c ) ) , indicating electron acceleration mostly at the beginning of the third episode of this complex flare and before the plasmoid ejection .",
    "some efforts have been made to search for simultaneous observations of reconnection inflows and outflows .",
    "reconnection rates have been estimated based on imaging observations of several flares @xcite and they are mostly in the range of 0.05 - 0.5 .",
    "a spectroscopic investigation by @xcite yielded a reconnection rate of 0.05 - 0.1 in a flare . without knowing the three - dimensional geometry of the flare , it is difficult to estimate the impact of the projection effect on the measured flow velocities . as a rough estimate , using 20  km  s@xmath1 ( 40/2 ) as the inflow speed and 125  km  s@xmath1 as the outflow speed leads to a reconnection rate of 0.16",
    "from the aia  211  movie we find fast downward - moving blobs along post - reconnection loops around 17:19:35 .",
    "the plane of sky component of the velocity of one blob is estimated to be @xmath0135  km  s@xmath1 from the space - time map of aia  211 ( figure  [ fig.3](h ) ) .",
    "this moving blob was captured by the iris slit , and we find a greatly enhanced redshifted component of the si  line profile , indicating a velocity of @xmath060  km  s@xmath1 in the line of sight ( location 3 in figures  [ fig.3 ] ) . the full speed can then be estimated as @xmath0150  km  s@xmath1 , which is comparable to the observed reconnection outflow speed in the line of sight .    while outward - moving blobs have been frequently reported @xcite , inward - moving blobs",
    "are rarely observed in flares .",
    "@xcite found that similar density enhancements along loop legs move even faster than the loop shrinks .",
    "these moving blobs could be accelerated plasma from the reconnection site .",
    "downward motion of loop legs was observed below the ejecta and the linear bright structure from 17:17:35 to 17:18:11 in the 1400  and 211  images .",
    "these relatively small loops ( north - south orientation ) may also be identified in aia 131  images , in which they seem to be partly obscured by longer loops ( east - west orientation ) which were only present in the hotter aia 131  and 94  passbands .",
    "one likely scenario is : while one ribbon of the flare was concentrated around the coordinate of ( 740@xmath3 , -207@xmath3 ) , the other ribbon was well separated , at locations of ( 740@xmath3 , -185@xmath3 ) and ( 695@xmath3 , -190@xmath3 ) respectively .",
    "the plane of sky component of the motion of these loops has been found to be @xmath055  km  s@xmath1 from the aia  211 observation ( figure  [ fig.1](i ) ) .",
    "the downward motion of these loops may be related to the reconnection inflow , or shrinking loops resulting from a reconnection process in the early stage of this flare .",
    "another possibility is magnetic implosion , and the contraction motion is caused by the reduction of the magnetic pressure due to energy release @xcite at the beginning of the flare .",
    "the iris slit moved to the location of these loops at 17:19:03 and 17:19:35 ( figures  [ fig.2 ] and [ fig.3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , o  , si  , c   and mg   lines , formed well below 1 mk , all exhibited clear splitting at these locations .",
    "we clearly see a broad redshifted ( by @xmath055  km  s@xmath1 ) component besides a narrow background component . at first sight",
    "this redshifted component seems to be associated with the loop motion .",
    "however , from the high - cadence aia 211  movie there appeared to be no obvious loop contraction at these times .",
    "instead , the redshifted component might be associated with falling plasma in these loops and the downward - propagating blobs are perhaps the denser part of the falling plasma .",
    "location 2 in figure  [ fig.3 ] corresponds to one footpoint of the flare loops .",
    "there we find significant enhancement at the blue side of the fe  1354.08  rest position .",
    "several neutral and singly ionized lines marked in figure  [ fig.2](e ) contributed to this emission .",
    "these lines , however , are narrow and can not explain the bulk enhancement .",
    "this emission feature is likely due to the highly blueshifted ( order of @xmath0260  km  s@xmath1 ) fe  line . at the same time , cool lines formed in the transition region and upper chromosphere ( e.g. , o  , si  , c   and mg  ) all exhibited significant redshifts at the same location .",
    "for example , the si   line is redshifted by @xmath050  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario of explosive chromospheric evaporation @xcite .",
    "using the o  line pair , the electron density is found to be on the order of log ( _ n_@xmath5/@xmath6)=11.0 at location 2 .",
    "we notice that strong evaporation flows were also present at 17:18:32 .    at 17:20:06",
    "the large blueshift at location 2 can still be seen ( figure  [ fig.4 ] ) .",
    "a single gaussian fit to this emission feature gives a blue shift of @xmath0260  km  s@xmath1 and a nonthermal width of @xmath044  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "all the neutral and singly ionized lines marked in figure  [ fig.2](e ) now disappeared , perhaps because there was no chromospheric material in the higher part of the loop .",
    "the fe   line profile in the evaporation flow seems to be entirely blueshifted by @xmath0260  km  s@xmath1 , in agreement with hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite",
    ". entirely shifted fe   line profiles have also been found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with previous observations of emission lines with formation temperatures lager than 10 mk by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard hinode , where usually a stationary emission component and a blueshifted component ( or blue wing enhancement ) co - exist during chromospheric evaporation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this difference possibly suggests that the resolution of eis is not high enough to separate the evaporation flow from the ambient stationary hot plasma .",
    "the different types of flows observed from combined imaging and spectroscopic observations are summarized in figures  [ fig.5](d ) . to our knowledge , this is one of the most complete observations of a variety of flows in one flare .",
    "the most interesting results are the following : ( 1 ) large red shift of fe   has been observed with iris for the first time and interpreted as a signature of reconnection downflows ; ( 2 ) fast blob - like structures have been observed to propagate from the reconnection site downward to the loop footpoints ; ( 3 ) the fe   line profile in the evaporation flow has been observed to be entirely blueshifted by @xmath0260  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "iris is a nasa small explorer mission developed and operated by lmsal with mission operations executed at nasa ames research center and major contributions to downlink communications funded by the norwegian space center ( nsc , norway ) through an esa prodex contract .",
    "this work is supported by contracts 8100002705 and sp02h1701r from lmsal to sao , nasa grant nnx11ab61 g , and nsf atm-08477719 .",
