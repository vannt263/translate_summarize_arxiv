    "the interaction strength of new low - mass particles with photons , electrons or nucleons is severely constrained by the well - known requirement that stars not lose energy in excess of observational constraints  @xcite .",
    "depending on the assumed particle mass and interaction structure , the most restrictive limits typically derive from population statistics in globular clusters , the white dwarf luminosity function , and the duration of the sn  1987a neutrino signal .",
    "such constraints usually imply that the solar particle emission is small compared to its photon luminosity , but it can still serve as a powerful source , e.g.  for the ongoing solar axion searches  @xcite .",
    "constraints based on the properties of the sun remain of interest , even if they are less restrictive than other astrophysical arguments , because they are more direct and thus perhaps more comparable to laboratory experiments .",
    "moreover , sometimes the sun is enough to test a given hypothesis . in this case",
    "it is nice to have a simple argument at hand that does not require more complicated astrophysical reasoning .",
    "previously the most sensitive diagnostic for the solar interior was the helioseismological sound - speed profile , providing restrictive energy - loss limits  @xcite .",
    "of course , the underlying chain of arguments is not simple and worse , a new determination of the solar element abundances  @xcite has created an unresolved tension between solar modeling and helioseismology  @xcite .",
    "while the conservative limit of ref .",
    "@xcite likely remains unchanged , it is nice that the measured solar neutrino flux provides a somewhat more restrictive limit based on a simpler argument .",
    "the recently completed sno measurements of the all - flavor solar neutrino flux  @xcite probe directly the physical conditions of the particle - emitting solar core .",
    "the steep temperature dependence of the @xmath1b neutrino production rate provides a sensitive test of the sun s interior that would be hotter if a lot of `` invisible energy '' were produced .",
    "the main purpose of our note is to update solar energy - loss constraints using the sno results .",
    "the inner solar temperature is around 1  kev , so these limits always apply to sub - kev mass particles , notably axions .",
    "recently the hypothesis of kev - scale bosons as possible dark matter candidates has received some attention  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some time ago it was proposed  @xcite that kev - mass pseudoscalars explain the annual modulation observed in the dama / libra experiment  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this intriguing intepretation was based on the incorrect axio - electric absorption rate of refs .",
    "@xcite , the correct rate being much larger but nearly independent of velocity  @xcite . while an earlier version of our manuscript was largely motivated by this now - dismissed interpretation , an evaluation of the solar limit for kev - mass bosons may still prove useful in future .",
    "we present the new solar energy - loss constraint in the context of axions and apply it explicitly to the axion - photon interaction strength .",
    "this result is of interest for solar axion searches .",
    "we also treat explicitly kev - mass bosons @xmath2 that couple to electrons . to this end",
    "we re - derive the @xmath3 compton cross section , correcting several errors in the literature .",
    "axions are of particular interest because the sun is used as a source for ongoing helioscope searches  @xcite .",
    "axions are produced by the primakoff process @xmath4 , that is mediated by a virtual photon due to the axion s two photon interaction @xmath5 . in the laboratory , solar axions",
    "convert back into @xmath6-rays while traveling along a dipole magnet oriented toward the sun . for @xmath7  ev , cast  @xcite provides the most restrictive limit of @xmath8 at 95% cl , where @xmath9 .",
    "the stellar energy - loss limit from globular - cluster stars is comparable , but without a detailed budget of systematic uncertainties .",
    "the axion luminosity @xmath10 @xcite represents a negligible perturbation of the sun if @xmath11 is below the cast limit .",
    "however , for larger couplings the energy loss modifies the solar structure . to maintain the observed amount of energy emitted at the surface , more energy than usual needs to be produced by nuclear burning .",
    "the latter is self  regulating , so the energy - producing regions must heat up . the extra losses",
    "would have operated for the entire lifetime of the sun so that one must evolve a zero - age model to its present age of , at which point it must match the present - day radius and surface luminosity .",
    "one adjusts the unknown pre - solar helium abundance to achieve this  fit .",
    "schlattl et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have produced a series of such self - consistent present - day solar models for different levels of axion emission based on the primakoff effect  @xcite .",
    "they provide the required pre - solar helium abundance and show the present - day central helium abundance , density and temperature as well as the neutrino fluxes . in 1998 the question of neutrino flavor oscillations",
    "was not yet settled .",
    "therefore , schlattl et al .  used helioseismology to provide a conservative constraint @xmath12 , corresponding to @xmath13 .",
    "the all - flavor solar neutrino flux from the @xmath1b reaction measured by the sno experiment  @xcite is a more direct probe .",
    "for @xmath14 the self - consistent solar models of schlattl et al .",
    "@xcite provide with excellent accuracy @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath1b solar neutrino flux for a solar model with axion losses @xmath17 whereas @xmath18 is for the standard case , and similar for the central temperature  @xmath19 .",
    "these power laws follow from a simple scaling argument because we are in a regime where the axion flux is a small perturbation .",
    "the second equation shows that energy generation by hydrogen burning for solar conditions scales approximately with @xmath20 and the @xmath1b flux varies roughly as @xmath21 .",
    "the main advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boronflux ] ) is that it uses the constraint of a self - consistent present - day solar model and that one has a direct connection between the sun - averaged neutrino and axion fluxes .",
    "the all - flavor solar neutrino flux from the @xmath1b reaction was measured by sno .",
    "the pure d@xmath22o phase provided a flux of @xmath23(stat)@xmath24(sys ) in units of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the salt phase provided @xmath26(stat)@xmath27(sys ) @xcite .",
    "very recently , the @xmath28he phase gave @xmath29(stat)@xmath30(sys ) @xcite .",
    "the old solar models predicted 5.94 in the same units , whereas the new opacities lead to  4.72 , each with a nominal @xmath31 error of 11% @xcite .",
    "the main non - abundance contributions to this uncertainty are opacity ( 6.8% ) , diffusion ( 4.2% ) and the @xmath32 factor for the @xmath33be reaction ( 3.8% ) .",
    "the measurements and predictions agree well within the stated errors , although the dominant uncertainty of the calculated fluxes evidently is from the assumed element abundances .",
    "it appears reasonably conservative to assume the true neutrino flux does not exceed the prediction by more than 50%  so that @xmath34 this nominal limit implies @xmath35 somewhat more restrictive than the helioseismological limit .",
    "the tokyo helioscope search provides a limit very similar to this result  @xcite , whereas the cast search is significantly more sensitive  @xcite and therefore self - consistent : an axion flux on the level of the cast limit would not cause any other observable modification of the sun or of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "the sensitivity of the helioscope technique quickly diminishes for @xmath36  ev .",
    "an alternative is bragg conversion in the strong electric field within a crystal lattice .",
    "this approach extends to kev - scale masses because the spatial @xmath37-field variation in the crystal provides the required momentum difference .",
    "constraints on @xmath38 from such experiments  @xcite are however less restrictive than the solar limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : solarlimit ] ) .",
    "the most recent constraint from the cdms experiment is @xmath39 at 95%  cl for @xmath40  kev @xcite .",
    "the exact energy - loss mechanism is irrelevant for the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : losslimit ] ) even though the spatial distribution of particle emission somewhat depends on the temperature and density variation of the relevant emission process .",
    "so we may consider other reactions besides the axion primakoff process .",
    "a case in point motivated by the hypothesis of kev scale dark matter  @xcite are bosons @xmath2 that interact with electrons through a yukawa coupling @xmath41 . such particles are emitted from stars by bremsstrahlung @xmath42 and the compton process @xmath43 . for pseudoscalars , bremsstrahlung contributes about 75% of the total emission in the sun , compton about 25% @xcite .",
    "however , the energy spectrum for bremsstrahlung is much softer than for compton . for kev mass particles threshold",
    "effects are important , so it is enough to use the compton process alone .",
    "we have calculated the compton cross sections for the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , scalar ( s ) , and vector ( v ) cases for bosons with a nonzero mass @xmath44 .",
    "the interaction is @xmath45 general expressions for the total compton cross section are given in the appendix , superseding for ps an erroneous result in the literature  @xcite . ) are missing . in an earlier version of our paper",
    "we had used this incorrect expression and found a spurious cross - section increase with @xmath44 .",
    "our limits would have excluded the full range of ps parameters explaining the dama annual modulation  @xcite , an interpretation that itself was based on a spurious cross section  @xcite . ] for the application in the sun we take the limit of nonrelativistic electrons with mass @xmath46 ( photon energy ) and use the velocity of the outgoing @xmath2 boson @xmath47 to express the cross sections . for  ps we find @xmath48 in agreement with ref .",
    "this is a superposition of a final - state @xmath49 and @xmath50 wave . for the other cases we find @xmath51 for s",
    "this is a final - state @xmath52 wave , for v a superposition of @xmath49 and @xmath52 . for a massless @xmath2 boson",
    "we have @xmath53 and the v cross section is twice that of s , representing 2 interacting spin degrees of freedom . for the other extreme",
    "@xmath54 our result reflects 3 interacting degrees of freedom relative to  s. in ref .",
    "@xcite the v cross section was stated without the velocity factors .",
    "we integrate the emission rate over a standard solar model  @xcite and find explicitly for @xmath55 @xmath56 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : losslimit ] ) this implies the constraints @xmath57 we show the @xmath44 dependence of these limits in fig .",
    "[ fig : exclusion ] .",
    "the sno measurements of the all - flavor solar neutrino flux produced by the very temperature - dependent @xmath58b reaction severely constrain anomalous solar energy losses .",
    "we have re - considered self - consistent solar models produced by schlattl et  al .",
    "@xcite who included axion losses by the primakoff effect .",
    "we have observed that the predicted solar neutrino flux is nicely reproduced by a simple and intuitive power law as a function of the assumed anomalous solar energy loss . in this way",
    "the measured neutrino flux and the assumed energy loss are directly related in a simple form .",
    "the excellent agreement between the measured and predicted solar neutrino flux provides a restrictive limit on any new energy loss channel of the sun .",
    "while constraints from other astrophysical arguments are usually more restrictive , the solar neutrino limit on new energy losses is complementary in that it is based on a direct diagnostic of the solar interior .",
    "in particular , we have derived a new solar limit on the axion - photon interaction strength @xmath38 , superseding an often - cited helioseismological result .",
    "only the cast experiment is sensitive enough to detect solar axions obeying our new constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq : solarlimit ] ) .    for bosons coupling to electrons",
    ", our limit extends to masses of almost 10  kev even though the solar inner temperature is around 1  kev .",
    "this would have been of interest to constrain the dama annual modulation in terms of kev - scale pseudoscalar dark matter particles . however , based on the corrected axio - electric absorption rate of ref .",
    "@xcite this interpretation is no longer viable .",
    "instead , recent direct constraints on kev - scale pseudoscalar dark matter by cogent  @xcite and cdms  @xcite are more restrictive than the solar limit .",
