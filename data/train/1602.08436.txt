    "the detection of gw150914 on september 14 , 2015 at 09:50:45 utc is a watershed event  @xcite . a sweeping up of the gw frequency and subsequent",
    "ringdown heralded formation of a black hole from a binary merger in a split second .",
    "gw has long been hypothesized as a cosmic messenger and detection of gw150914 has opened a new window to the universe .",
    "a few years earlier the icecube neutrino observatory detected cosmic high - energy neutrinos for the first time  @xcite and ushered an era of multimessenger astronomy .",
    "binary mergers of neutron stars ( nss ) or black hole ( bh ) and ns systems have been proposed to be the progenitors of short grbs  @xcite . since gw is naturally produced in binary mergers ,",
    "it has been predicted to be coincident with the short grbs  @xcite .",
    "detection of a short grb of duration 1  s , gw150914-gbm within 0.4  s and from within @xmath1 square degree arrival direction uncertainty of the gw150914 by the _ fermi_-gbm  @xcite is therefore very intriguing .",
    "gw150914-gbm could not be characterized very well due to large uncertainty in the _ fermi_-gbm position , ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) with a @xmath4 uncertainty region over 9000 square degrees in the standard 50 - 300  kev analysis ; ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) with a @xmath4 uncertainty region about 3000 square degrees for 100 - 1000  kev analysis .",
    "gw150914-gbm was outside of the field of view of the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) initially and no gev afterglow was detected when it could observe  @xcite .",
    "a joint ligo-_fermi _ analysis reduces the @xmath7 confidence region for gw150914 to 199 square degrees and located in the southern hemisphere ( see , fig .",
    "8 bottom right panel in ref .",
    "the integral / spi - acs also observed the gw150914 localization region in hard x - ray without detection  @xcite .",
    "the isotropic - equivalent luminosity of gw150914-gbm in the 1  kev to 10 mev energy range was @xmath8  erg / s  @xcite using a @xmath9  mpc distance inferred from the gw150914 event  @xcite .",
    "the true luminosity and hence the true energy radiated , depending on the grb jet opening angle , is much lower . as for comparison ,",
    "the total energy radiated in gw was @xmath10  erg  @xcite .",
    "a binary merger of two bhs , as proposed for the origin of the gw150914 event  @xcite , is traditionally thought to produce no electromagnetic counterpart due to a lack of accretion material .",
    "detection of gw150914-gbm  @xcite , however , have raised the possibility that the binary bh systems may also possess some accretion material . in a recent work ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite modeled that one of the bhs of the binary system could possess a long - lived dormant accretion disk created from the explosion of its low - metallicity progenitor star .",
    "this disk is fully revived only during the final merger of the bhs and is accreted rapidly to power a short grb . in the particular case of gw150914 , an accretion disk of mass @xmath11 around a @xmath12 bh may exist  @xcite , which is sufficient to power gw150914-gbm with a significant baryon load in its jet .",
    "high energy neutrinos can be produced in the grb jet from interactions of shock - accelerated protons with the observed @xmath13 rays  @xcite .",
    "detection of hen from gw150914-gbm could potentially measure the total jet power and yet uncertain jet bulk lorentz factor for the short grbs .",
    "the antares and icecube neutrino observatories have searched for hen in coincidence with the gw150914 but no detection has been reported  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we calculate the hen flux using the short grb characteristics of gw150914-gbm and estimate the corresponding number of hese events at the icecube detector .",
