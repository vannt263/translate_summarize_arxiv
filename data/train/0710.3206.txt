    "the jacquet module of a representation of a semisimple ( or reductive ) lie group is introduced by casselman  @xcite .",
    "one of the motivation of considering the jacquet module is to investigate homomorphisms to principal series representations , which is an important invariant of a representation .",
    "one of the powerful tools to study the jacquet module of a parabolic induction is the bruhat filtration  @xcite .",
    "this is a filtration on the jacquet module defined from the bruhat decomposition .",
    "casselman - hecht - milicic  @xcite use the bruhat filtration to determine the dimension of the ( moderate - growth ) whittaker model of a principal series representation ( another proof for kostant s result ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the bruhat filtration and show that the successive quotient is described using the twisting functor defined by arkhipov  @xcite . if a principal series representation has the unique langlands quotient , then the successive quotient is the induction from the jacquet module of a smaller group ( a levi part of a parabolic subgroup ) .",
    "however , in a general case , it becomes `` twisted '' induction , which has the same character as that of an induced representation but has a different module structure .",
    "moreover , we investigate its generalization , this is related to the whittaker model . in @xcite , casselman suggested to generalize the notion of the jacquet module .",
    "for this generalized jacquet module , we can also define a bruhat filtration and the successive quotient of the resulting filtration is described in terms of the generalized twisting functor .",
    "this result gives a strategy to determine all whittaker models of a parabolic induction . to determine it",
