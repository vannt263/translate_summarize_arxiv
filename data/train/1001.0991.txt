    "stable processes are probably the most fascinating members of the vast family of lvy processes . they enjoy the scaling property , which states that the process @xmath0 has the same distribution as @xmath1 . another well - known process which also enjoys this property is brownian motion , for which we can compute explicitly the distribution ( in many cases even the joint distribution ) of many important functionals ; an extensive collection of these facts can be found in @xcite . in the case of stable processes",
    "the situation is much less satisfactory : we do not have general explicit results even for such a basic functional as the supremum . however",
    ", there does exist an `` almost '' general result : doney @xcite has obtained closed - form expressions for the wiener  hopf factors for a dense set of parameters .",
    "these results have inspired the main idea for our current work .",
    "in @xcite it was proven that if parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy @xmath4 for some integers @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then there exists a fully explicit representation for the wiener  hopf factors , given as a ratio of two finite products of length @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath2 is irrational , relation ( [ eqn_def_ckl ] ) defines a countable set of values of @xmath9 , which is dense in @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath2 is fixed and irrational , we have a function with explicit representation for a dense countable set of values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this situation reminds one of an analogous property of elliptic functions : when a certain parameter is a rational number there often exists an explicit expression , or at least a reduction to some simpler functions .",
    "therefore , given results obtained in @xcite , it seems highly probable that there should exist a connection between extrema of stable processes and elliptic functions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to exhibit this connection and as a consequence to obtain a remarkably large number of explicit results on extrema of stable processes .",
    "first we will present some definitions and notations .",
    "we will always use the principal branch of the logarithm , which is defined in the domain @xmath11 by requiring that @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the power function will be defined as @xmath13 in the domain @xmath11 .",
    "we will work with a stable process @xmath14 , which is a lvy process with the characteristic exponent @xmath15)$ ] given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the characteristic exponent is essentially a power function of order @xmath2 implies the scaling property , which states that processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 have the same distribution .",

    "next we introduce a parameter @xmath24 and rewrite ( [ def_psi0 ] ) as @xmath25    another important parameter is @xmath26 , which was computed in closed form in @xcite @xmath27 one can see that parameters @xmath28 belong to the set @xmath29\\},\\ ] ] if and only if parameters @xmath30 belong to the following set : @xmath31\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } \\cup \\{\\alpha\\in(1,2 ) , \\rho\\in[1-\\alpha^{-1 } , \\alpha^{-1}]\\}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we will call @xmath32 the admissible set of parameters and will parametrize the stable process @xmath14 by @xmath30 .",

    "hopf factorization is trivial . in the limiting case as @xmath37 and @xmath38 we",
    "obtain brownian motion @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) the process @xmath14 is spectrally positive ( negative ) .",
    "in this case we have complete information about the wiener  hopf factorization and the distribution of extrema due to the work of bingham @xcite , doney @xcite , bernyk , dalang and peskir @xcite and patie @xcite .",
    "the following family of stable processes , which was introduced in @xcite , will be very important in our paper .    for @xmath43",

    "another important fact is that the process @xmath14 with parameters @xmath30 belongs to @xmath44 [ and @xmath40 ] if and only if the process @xmath58 with parameters @xmath59 belongs to @xmath60 .",
    "this property , which can be easily verified using relation ( [ eqn_def_ckl ] ) , will appear in many formulas throughout this paper and will be very useful for us later .",

    "this can be easily checked using ( [ eqn_def_ckl ] ) , as the dual process has parameters @xmath63 .",
    "next , we define the supremum and infimum processes @xmath64 we introduce a random variable @xmath65 ( exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath66 ) which is independent of the process @xmath14",

    "to reduce the complexity of the problem , we note first that it is enough to study the positive wiener  hopf factor @xmath71 , as the corresponding information about @xmath75 can be obtained by considering the dual process .",

    "in section [ section_pdf_supremum ] we derive several convergent and asymptotic series representations for the probability density function of the supremum @xmath84 .",
    "our main tool in studying the wiener  hopf factor @xmath79 will be a certain function @xmath80 , which has many properties similar to elliptic functions , but first we need to define two types of domains in the complex plane .",

    "when @xmath92 we have @xmath93 , therefore @xmath88 becomes a horizontal strip which does not depend on @xmath94 , while parallelogram @xmath90 degenerates into the horizontal strip @xmath95 .",

    "intuitively this is clear , since the ratio of gamma functions in ( [ mm_ckl ] ) decreases to zero faster than any exponential function as @xmath516 , while the other factor is just a ratio of periodic functions in @xmath517 .",
    "the rigorous proof can be obtained as follows : @xmath518 where we have denoted @xmath519 using stirling s approximation for the gamma function one can check that for all @xmath520 , the function @xmath521 converges to zero as @xmath514 ( uniformly in @xmath522 ) ; thus the integral in the right - hand side of ( [ p_shift_contour2 ] ) vanishes as @xmath514 , and we have a convergent series representation ( [ alpha_12_eq_1 ] ) .",
    "the convergence of series ( [ alpha_01_eq_1 ] ) can be established in the same way , except that now we have to shift the contour of integration in the opposite direction .",
    "it is important to note that all the asymptotic expansions and series representations for @xmath451 presented in theorems [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] can be differentiated @xmath507 times term - by - term , where @xmath523 is an arbitrary integer . for the series representation",
    "this follows easily by the standard argument of interchanging derivative and summation ( both the series and its derivatives converge uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath469 ) .",
    "more work is needed to establish a similar result for the asymptotic expansions , as it is not generally true that one can differentiate asymptotic expansions term - by - term .",
    "a classic counter - example is provided by the function @xmath524 for which the asymtptotic expansion of @xmath525 can not be obtained by simply taking term - by - term derivative of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath168 .",
    "thus in order to establish the result on the asymptotic expansion of @xmath526 we would have to repeat the steps of the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] : first we take @xmath507th derivative of both sides of ( [ p_as_inv_of_m ] ) .",
    "then we interchange the order of integration and differentiation in the right - hand side of ( [ p_as_inv_of_m ] ) ; this can be easily justified using the standard uniform - convergence argument .",
    "finally we shift the contour of integration to obtain asymptotic estimates .",
    "it is very likely that the asymptotic expansions given in theorem [ thm1 ] can also be interpreted as convergent series ; however , it seems to be very hard to prove this fact analytically .",
    "the above proof of theorem [ thm2 ] was based on two facts : @xmath371 decays faster than any exponential function as @xmath527 [ the sign depends on whether @xmath528 or @xmath40 ] , and that @xmath371 is essentially a product of a function which decays very fast and a function which is periodic .",
    "the first fact is still true in the general case : using ( [ g_asympt_formula ] ) and ( [ formula_ms_general ] ) one can prove that as @xmath529 and @xmath530 , we have @xmath531 the major problem now is that when @xmath470 we do not have any periodicity .",
    "moreover , to make matters worse , when we move the contour of integration farther away from zero , the poles of @xmath371 become more and more dense , and it is very hard to find an upper bound on @xmath532 for small values of @xmath533 .",
    "one can also see that the behavior of the coefficients @xmath534 and @xmath535 is much more unpredictable compared to @xmath536 , and it is hard to say anything about the growth / decay of these coefficients as @xmath201 or @xmath202 becomes large .",
    "numerical results , however , indicate that the product of ratios of @xmath537 functions in ( [ def_a_mn ] ) remains bounded as @xmath201 or @xmath202 becomes large , as long as @xmath2 is not too close to a rational number .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to expect that the following conjecture is true :    _ conjecture _ : assume that @xmath538 .",
    "if @xmath40 @xmath539 , then the infinite series ( [ eqn_p_0 ] ) \\{([eqn_p_infty ] ) } converges to @xmath451 for all @xmath520 .",
