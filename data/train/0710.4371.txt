    "first - principles electronic - structure calculations based on density - functional theory  @xcite(dft ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional have opened a way to predict ground - state properties of various materials without introducing _ ad hoc _ parameters .",
    "however , there exist serious problems in which the dft fails even qualitatively .",
    "typical examples are found in strongly - correlated electron systems such as the genuine mott insulator , where an insulating gap opens in partially filled bands solely owing to the strong local electron - electron repulsion.@xcite the dft with lda / gga often predicts metals for these systems,@xcite indicating the fact that the xc functionals based on lda / gga do not correctly capture the local correlation in real space .",
    "other typical example is found in dynamics and excitation spectra of electrons , in which many - body correlation effects are also essential.@xcite even semiconductors , being supposed to belong to weakly - correlated electron systems in the ground state , may have highly - degenerate excited states arising from the local electron correlation effects , and thus the single - particle approximations such as the kohn - sham  @xcite and hartree - fock  @xcite schemes break down in general .",
    "it is well known that incorporating two - particle interactions between electrons and holes generated by the excitation is crucial in describing the electronic structure at low - energy levels .",
    "a typical example is found in excitonic excitations.@xcite    to treat these excitations properly , we clearly need to go beyond the single - particle theory , while a full _ ab initio _ calculation taking into account the many - body correlation effects is practically intractable .",
    "to go beyond the lda / hartree - fock levels , we are required to develop a sufficiently accurate but efficient and practically feasible method .",
    "this challenge , so - called `` beyond lda / hartree - fock '' problem has attracted growing interest.@xcite the gw method  @xcite has been developed to incorporate self - energy effects basically on the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) while strong correlation and fluctuation effects beyond the rpa level require a more accurate and reliable treatment .",
    "especially , an _ ab initio _ three - stage scheme has been rapidly developed by combining two procedures , namely , lda / hartree - fock framework and accurate low - energy solvers.@xcite the global electronic structure is first obtained by the lda / hartree - fock scheme . in the next stage ,",
    "one performs a bridging treatment , that is _ downfolding _ ,  @xcite by eliminating the high - energy degrees of freedom leaving the low - energy effective model ( hamiltonian or lagrangian ) for local bases like wannier functions.@xcite the downfolding determines parameters for the effective low - energy model via first - principles calculations .",
    "the resulting low - energy model is , in the final stage , solved by low - energy reliable solvers such as dynamical mean field theory,@xcite path - integral renormalization group ,  @xcite and/or various monte - carlo methods  @xcite developed for treating the correlation effects .",
    "such a hierarchical three - stage scheme instead of a full _ ab initio _ calculation allows us to perform a first - principles and parameter - free prediction of the electronic structure of the strongly - correlated electron system within the present feasibility of computer .    in this paper , we present theoretical studies on the _ ab initio _ downfolding scheme to assess the reliability for treating dynamical properties . in our scheme ,",
    "maximally localized wannier functions are introduced as a basis function for representing the model hamiltonian .",
    "this basis offers computationally convenient choice , because this wannier function can be computed with any basis functions ( plane wave,@xcite linearized muffin - tin orbital,@xcite linearized augmented plane wave,@xcite etc ) .",
    "transfer parameters are evaluated by calculating kohn - sham matrix elements in this basis , and onsite / offsite interaction parameters including screening effects are determined via constrained calculations.@xcite    in the three - stage scheme , the reliability of the downfolding procedure and the accuracy of the resulting model parameters are crucially important . in particular , the reliability in describing dynamics and excitation spectra has to be critically tested .",
    "for this purpose , we make a critical comparison between experimental results and computational results for the generated model . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on optical - absorption properties .",
    "it is widely recognized and accepted in the literature that the optical absorption of solids , in particular for semiconductors or insulators , is deeply affected by excitonic effects.@xcite this effect originates from an effective coulomb interaction between electrons and holes and therefore is sensitive to the magnitude of the interaction parameters in the model hamiltonian . to examine this effect through the present formalism ,",
    "we choose gaas as a representative material exhibiting spectral enhancement due to the excitonic effect and calculate its optical spectra by taking account of the electron - hole interaction .",
    "there exist many experimental  @xcite and highly - accurate _ ab initio _",
    "@xcite spectral data for this material .",
    "therefore , our downfolding formalism and determined parameters can be critically tested by examining whether our model spectrum reproduces those data satisfactorily .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe our downfolding procedure ; we introduce a complete - neglect - differential - overlap model which is used as our target model hamiltonian and describe computational details for determining the model parameters . in sec .",
    "iii , to take into account the electron - hole interaction , we introduce a single - excitation - configuration - interaction framework for calculating an optical absorption .",
    "efficient techniques to evaluate one - body velocity matrix elements needed in the spectral calculation , based on the wannier interpolation scheme , is described in appendix .",

    ", we first specify the form of the final effective low - energy hamiltonian . in the present downfolding procedure",
    ", we will make several approximations by simplifying the low - energy effective hamiltonian , in which we expect that the approximations do not alter the optical spectra seriously .",
    "the first approximation is to consider only the diagonal coulomb interaction and ignore the offdiagonal part ( exchange interaction ) in the low - energy effective model , which results in an extended hubbard model or , in other words , the complete - neglect - differential - overlap ( cndo ) model .",

    "the crystal cndo hamiltonian @xmath6 consists of a one - body part @xmath7 and an interaction part @xmath8 : @xmath9 the one - body part @xmath7 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a creation ( annihilation ) operator of a valence electron with spin @xmath13 in @xmath14-type localized basis centered at @xmath15th site in lattice @xmath16 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we use the maximally localized wannier function ( mlwf ) as the basis function for representing the cndo hamiltonian . in the present study of gaas , there are eight wf s in the primitive cell , where the first four belong to a ga site , and the remaining four belong to an as site .",
    "thus , the index @xmath14 specifies four types of lobe directions ( band indices ) of the mlwf s , and the suffix @xmath15 specifies the ga or as sites . @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the ionization potential and the transfer integral , respectively . notice that the translational symmetry in the crystal is explicitly considered for matrix elements ; @xmath19 @xmath17 and @xmath20 @xmath21 for any @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "we now describe the downfolding procedure and parameterization for the cndo model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cndo ] ) .",
    "the downfolding consists of two parts .",
    "the first is the derivation of the kinetic energy part , where a tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath33 is derived .",
    "the second part is the derivation of the interaction part @xmath34 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath33 given in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : h_t ] ) is derived from the global band structure after eliminating higher - energy bands .",
    "this downfolding may be performed by the perturbation scheme.@xcite the resultant band structure is normally very close to the low - energy part of the original band structure and the difference is not discernible when the low - energy retained part is isolated from the eliminated high - energy bands.@xcite this means that the self - energy of the retained bands caused by the higher - energy eliminated electrons is negligible .",
    "since such self - energy effects are smaller even in semiconductor systems , in this paper , we employ the low - energy part of the bands as the retained bands after the elimination of the higher - energy bands .",
    "now we retain eight bands near the fermi level and construct wannier orbitals from the retained band structure . to this end , _ ab initio _",
    "mlwf s are constructed with the souza - marzari - vanderbilt algorithm.@xcite we set an energy window in the interval [ @xmath4 ev:@xmath5 ev ] , which includes four valence and four conduction bands of the system .",
    "the resulting ga and as mlwf s are displayed in the top and bottom panels of fig .",

    "in fact , the dielectric constant of gaas is rather high ; @xmath49 experimentally,@xcite indicating that the coulomb interaction decays as @xmath50 in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "we thus employ an approximation for this interaction ; we keep only onsite interactions @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite as the basic strategy , one first kinetically decouple a specific site from the rest of the system , thus leaving this site isolated as the so - called atomic limit .",
    "this decoupling treatment is achieved by switching off the hoppings between the wannier orbitals at the specific site and all the other orbitals , where we identify the hoppings with the off - diagonal kohn - sham matrix elements in the representation of the wannier functions .",
    "with such a hopping cutoff , the standard constrained total energy calculations are performed to generate a potential energy surface with respect to constrained parameters such as occupancies of the wannier orbitals belonging to the decoupled site .",
    "the interaction parameters obtained with quadratic fitting to the resulting potential energy data include screening effects ascribed to the relaxation of the valence electron density around the decoupled site . in the present case ,",
    "the procedure for determining the interaction parameters is somewhat complicated because of a large number of the interaction parameters to be derived .",
    "so , in the practical work , we divide the treatment into two steps ; the determination of @xmath52 and @xmath53 and the subsequent step for determining an offsite parameter @xmath51 .",
    "the basic strategy for obtaining @xmath52 and @xmath53 is to generate potential - energy - data sets with respect to two types of the constrained parameters ; ( i ) the first potential - energy data are obtained from the constrained calculations with respect to occupancy @xmath54 of a specific wannier orbital @xmath14 at the site @xmath55 , and ( ii ) another data are obtained from the constrained calculations for a site occupancy @xmath56 defined as the total amount of the orbital occupancies belonging to this site ; @xmath57 .",

    "for example , let us consider a configuration formed by a pair of the ga wannier orbital and the as wannier orbital , where these orbitals face along the covalent bond of the two atoms ( we call it _ facing configuration _ ) .",
    "an example for the facing configuration can be found in the two wannier orbitals displayed in the top and bottom panels of fig .",

    "thus , the @xmath51 value in this configuration is crucial for an accurate description of the low - energy band structure and optical excitations .",
    "the contributions from the intersite interaction in the other configurations are much smaller in optical response .",

    "we see a notable change in the spectra due to the parameter increase [ ( a ) @xmath181 ( b ) @xmath181 ( c ) ] ; increasing @xmath177 makes a blue shift and an intensity decrease in the calculated spectra .",
    "we see that the spectrum at the downfolded choice ( i.e. , the case with @xmath177 = 1.0 ) exhibits the best agreement with the experiments among all the choices .",
    "the downfolded value offers the most realistic and accurate choices as the model parameters , and thus we conclude that the optical excitation spectrum is correctly captured by the downfolded hamiltonian .    finally , we remark a recent development for _ ab initio _ evaluations for the offsite @xmath51 parameter .",
    "indeed , applications of the constrained schemes to the determinations of the offsite parameter is quite limited in the literature compared with those for the onsite parameters .",
    "recently , aryasetiawan _ et al_@xcite have proposed an rpa approach for calculating the interaction parameters .",
    "they first calculate a real - space screened coulomb interaction @xmath182 by excluding the polarization formed in target bands contained in the model hamiltonian and then evaluate the matrix element of @xmath52 in the localized basis such as linearized muffin - tin orbitals and/or maximally - localized wannier functions .",
    "this approach is able to derive all the offsite parameters .",
    "so , comparisons between the values obtained by the present constrained scheme and the values based on the rpa approach would contribute to making deeper understanding for the distant interaction parameters .",
    "we have examined whether the effective low - energy hamiltonian derived from the downfolding procedure is able to describe dynamics and excitation spectra in a proper way .",
    "the calculation is performed in the three - stage scheme . in the first stage , we calculate the global electronic structure from the density functional theory supplemented by the generalized gradient approximation . the high - energy degrees of the freedom in the global electronic band structure are , in the second stage , eliminated by the downfolding scheme , which leaves only the low - energy bands near the fermi level . in the present example of gaas",
    ", we retain up to 25 ry for the calculation of the global electronic bands , while the downfolded hamiltonian keeps only eight bands near the fermi level up to 15 ev ( @xmath183 1 ry ) . by the downfolding , kinetic and interaction energies",
    "are separately renormalized into the low - energy eight bands and the effective hamiltonian , where we employ the cndo model neglecting the offdiagonal part of the coulomb interaction , is constructed from first principles , with the help of the maximally localized wannier functions .",
    "this procedure , though several simplified treatments are employed , in principle , does not contain any _ ad hoc _ parameters . in the third stage",
    ", the hartree - fock method for the ground state supplemented by the single - excitation configuration - interaction treatment for considering the electron - hole interactions has been applied to obtain electronic excitation spectra of semiconductor gaas .",
    "the spectra thus obtained have quite well reproduced the experimental results ; the intensity and position for the excitonic peak are well reproduced at a quantitative level .",
    "we believe that the present model construction based on the downfolding offers a reliable _ ab initio _ scheme , where the downfolded effective hamiltonian is capable of not only the ground state properties but also the excitation spectra .",
    "the present result opens a way of treating excitations such as the optical spectra by the hybrid method combining the density functional approach and the accurate low - energy solver for the low - energy effective models . beyond the present application to semiconductors",
    ", it would be interesting to apply this approach to excitations in strongly correlated electron systems such as transition metal oxides including the cuprates . in the present paper",
    ", we have used the hartree - fock approximation for the ground state and the single - excitation configuration - interaction treatment for the excitations .",
    "optical excitation spectra of gaas have satisfactorily been treated by these approximations and the experimental results have been well reproduced .",
    "however , stronger electron correlation effects require more sophisticated low - energy solver than the hartree fock / single excitation configuration interaction treatment . for more different and challenging issues of the electron correlation",
    ", the low - energy effective hamiltonian may indeed be treated by much more reliable low - energy solver for electrons in solids , such as quantum monte carlo methods for lattice fermions,@xcite path - integral renormalization group method,@xcite and cluster extensions of the dynamical mean field theory.@xcite    as is well known , there are many direct _ ab initio _ schemes aiming at considering correlation effects ; for example , the gw,@xcite transcorrelated ,  @xcite and quantum monte carlo methods.@xcite they are straightforward ways for approaching the problem compared to the present approach .",
    "however , the straightforward methods are faced with two serious problems : one is that the computational load becomes extremely heavy when all the electrons or even all the valence electrons are treated equally .",
    "the other problem is that the so far developed straightforward methods do not offer a sufficiently accurate framework if the electron correlation becomes strong such as in the genuine mott insulator .",
    "the crucial point is that we need to treat dynamical as well as spatial correlations and fluctuations near the fermi level in a controllable way . in the present stage of the computer power ,",
    "such sufficient accuracies are undertaken only within simple models , which can be achieved in the low - energy effective model after downfolding .",
    "in fact , the high accuracy required from the temporal and spatial quantum fluctuations is important only in the low - energy region near the fermi level , which justifies to restrict the high - accuracy treatment only in the region of low - energy excitations and thus only within the downfolded hamiltonian . within the present computer power",
    ", this downfolding procedure opens an avenue of studying highly correlated electron systems as well as excitations without relying on _ ad hoc _ parameters . by explicitly considering the energy hierarchy in the electronic structure ,",

    "<S> we examine whether essence and quantitative aspects of electronic excitation spectra are correctly captured by an effective low - energy model constructed from an _ ab initio _ downfolding scheme . a global electronic structure </S>",
    "<S> is first calculated by _ ab initio _ density - functional calculations with the generalized gradient approximation . with the help of constrained density functional theory , </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy effective hamiltonian for bands near the fermi level is constructed by the downfolding procedure in the basis of maximally localized wannier functions . </S>",
    "<S> the excited states of this low - energy effective hamiltonian ascribed to an extended hubbard model are calculated by using a low - energy solver . </S>",
    "<S> as the solver , we employ the hartree - fock approximation supplemented by the single - excitation configuration - interaction method considering electron - hole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the present three - stage method is applied to gaas , where eight bands are retained in the effective model after the downfolding . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectra well reproduce the experimental results , indicating that our downfolding scheme offers a satisfactory framework of the electronic structure calculation , particularly for the excitations and dynamics as well as for the ground state . </S>"
