    "the basic ingredient of exchange processes are clusters .",
    "we suppose that clusters are composed of a certain integer number of elemental building blocks ( ` monomers ' ) ; clusters are thus labelled by their masses , other characteristics ( e.g. , their shape ) are not explicitly taken into account .",
    "we also assume that in each exchange event , a monomer is transferred from one cluster to another .",
    "an exchange event can be separated into detachment of a monomer , subsequent transport to another cluster and attachment to it , so the comprehensive description of exchange processes can be complicated .",
    "we focus on the detachment - controlled limit when the time scale for transport and subsequent attachment is negligible .",
    "denote by @xmath0 a cluster of mass @xmath1 , that is , a cluster which is made of @xmath1 monomers . symbolically , the mass exchange process can be represented as @xmath2 we assume that a cluster is equally likely to gain or to lose mass in an interaction .",
    "this implies that the reaction rate matrix ( ` kernel ' in short ) is symmetric : @xmath3 .",
    "a cluster disappears when its mass reaches zero .",
    "thus the number of clusters decreases by 1 with probability 1/2 when strictly one of the reacting clusters is a monomer ; if both reacting clusters are monomers , one of the monomers disappears and the other becomes a dimer .",
    "exchange processes with rather general classes of homogeneous symmetric kernels , e.g. , with kernels of the form @xmath4 , have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the density @xmath5 of clusters containing @xmath6 monomers at time @xmath7 evolves according to the rate equation @xmath8\\ ] ] this equation assumes perfect mixing , or equivalently , absence of spatial correlations .",
    "furthermore , the total number of clusters is assumed to be infinite ; otherwise , even if we ignore the locations of clusters , the system will eventually condense into a single cluster and close to the condensation time fluctuations in number of clusters become important , so the deterministic rate equation framework looses its validity . even for infinite systems in homogeneous settings ,",
    "the rate equation framework becomes inapplicable in low dimensions , particularly in one dimension ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "exchange processes help in classifying and interpreting emergent phenomena in various complex systems @xcite .",
    "pure exchange process may provide an idealized description of binary interactions underlying the dynamics of such complex systems .",

    "perhaps the most ubiquitous example of an external drive is input ; e.g. , it is a key element in deposition processes and it naturally arises in phase ordering .",

    "pure exchange processes resemble aggregation processes @xcite . in the framework of aggregation",
    ", the influence of input has been studied .",
    "the outcome was somewhat surprising : for basic reaction kernels , aggregation processes with homogeneous input are _ simpler _ than corresponding pure aggregation processes , viz . in the most interesting large time limit",
    "the dominant part of the cluster mass distribution acquires a stationary form ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there are exceptional kernels and whenever the stationary form is never reached , the emergent behaviors tend to be subtle ( often they are characterized by more than one mass scale @xcite )",
    ". we shall show that in contrast to aggregation , exchange processes with spatially homogeneous input do not reach steady states .",
    "the emergent evolutionary behaviors , however , are usually qualitatively the same as for exchange processes without input @xcite .",
    "our second goal is to study exchange processes with a localized source .",
    "a classification of possible behaviors in such processes appears unattainable  the behaviors depend on the reaction kernel , on the ( mass - dependent ) diffusion coefficients , and mathematically one has to study an infinite system of coupled non - linear partial differential equations . in the idealized situation",
    "when the diffusion coefficients are mass - independent , however , the models with a localized source are partly tractable .",
    "more precisely , the cluster mass distribution becomes stationary , at least in the most relevant three - dimensional setting , and this feature greatly simplifies analysis .    our analysis of mass exchange processes with input relies on scaling techniques .",
    "the emergence of scaling is difficult to prove , so it is useful to have exact results at least for simplest kernels which can be compared with outcomes of scaling analyses .",
    "it turned out that the model with product kernel remains solvable when we add homogeneous input .",

    "this is the most natural choice : the same elemental mass which is transferred in each exchange event is also added .",
    "the details of the input , however , do not affect qualitative behaviors ( as long as clusters of only small masses are added ) .",
    "we shall also assume that the system is initially empty , @xmath27 so that the mass density is equal to time , @xmath28 if only monomers are injected and if the monomer flux is set to unity .    in the case of the product kernel , @xmath9",
