    "among all the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite galaxies of the milky way ( mw ) , fornax is the only one hosting five globular clusters ( gcs ) , at projected distances from its centre smaller than 1 kpc . on the other hand",
    ", this galaxy does not exhibit any evidence of a clear central over density or the presence of a massive black hole ( mbh ) .",
    "several works have pointed out that the fornax dsph lies inside a huge dark matter halo ( dmh ) @xcite .",
    "the presence of gcs , named fornax 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 , represents an open puzzle since the action of dynamical friction ( df ) should have dragged them into the galactic centre a few gyrs ago . indeed , these old , metal - poor gcs have ages exceeding @xmath1 gyr @xcite , a value significantly larger than their df decay time @xcite .",
    "however , it has been widely demonstrated that the standard approach for studying the df process , developed so far by @xcite , poorly describes the motion in axisymmetric and triaxial @xcite or spherical and cuspy galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the orbital energy loss depends primarily on the host galaxy structure , a reliable description of the gcs motion requires a detailed knowledge of the fornax mass distribution .",
    "though the fornax dsph is believed , like all the dsphs , to be enclosed within a dmh , its density profile seems to differ significantly from the standard prediction of the @xmath2-cdm paradigm , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "indeed , observational constraints suggest a flatter density profile @xcite .",
    "hence , the study of the dynamical evolution of fornax gcs can shed light on the structure of dsph galaxies , and , in particular , on their dm content .",
    "currently , several scenarios have been proposed and debated to explain the dynamical evolution of the fornax and its gcs .",
    "for instance , some authors proposed that this galaxy is characterised by a flat density profile , with a core extending up to @xmath4 pc @xcite , while others argued that it is the product of a merger event @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed , instead , that the assumption of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite leads to a direct interpretation of the observed dynamical status of the fornax gcs .",
    "another possibility relies upon that df halts its role within the region where the density profile flattens @xcite .",
    "using recent observational data , in a companion paper we revisited the so called `` timing '' problem , showing that all the gcs have been formed within the fornax tidal radius , even in the case of a standard cdm density profile for the fornax halo @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the presence of 5 gcs moving in the inner region of the galaxy coincides with the absence of a bright nucleus .",
    "bright nuclei , often referred to as nuclear clusters ( ncs ) , are very dense stellar systems with masses in the range @xmath5 m@xmath6 observed in galaxies of all the hubble types @xcite .",
    "some authors proposed an `` in - situ '' origin for ncs @xcite ; another possibility is that gcs decay toward the centre of their host galaxy , where they collide and merge , driving the formation of a nc and , even , the accretion of a black hole seed therein @xcite .",
    "this channel of formation , named `` dry - merger '' scenario , has been successfully investigated both on a theoretical and numerical side @xcite , and explains satisfactorily the observed correlations among ncs properties and those of their host galaxies @xcite . recently",
    ", some authors have shown that the tidal forces induced by a very massive bh can tidally disrupt the infalling gcs , thus suppressing the formation of a nc @xcite .    in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite investigated the future evolution of the 11 young massive clusters located in the dwarf starburst galaxy henize 2 - 10 .",
    "this work is the first showing that the formation of a nc is a process that can occur in a galaxy containing a pre - existing mbh , even if the tidal field induced by the massive bh and by the background stars can alter significantly the nc formation process . in the same framework , in this paper we simulate the future evolution of the fornax globular cluster system ( gcs ) making use of direct @xmath0-body modelling .",
    "the availability of high - quality data on the gcs structural and orbital parameters and on the host galaxy would allow us to investigate whether their future evolution may lead to the formation of a nucleated region .",
    "this has a double aim : i ) study the ongoing orbital decay process and put constraints on the possible formation of nuclear clusters in dwarf spheroidal galaxies , and , ii ) extrapolate our results backward in time in order to obtain hints about the gcs origin and past evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we describe the matter distribution adopted to model the galaxy and the gcs , and the numerical method used ; in section [ results ] we present the results of the @xmath0-body simulations and discuss them in section [ discussion ] ; finally , in section [ conclusion ] we draw the conclusions of this work .",
    "in this work we present results from a series of direct @xmath0-body simulations in which we modelled the orbital decay of the 5 gcs orbiting in the fornax dsph galaxy . to carry out the simulations , we used the direct @xmath0-body code ` higpus ` @xcite , a 6@xmath7-order hermite integrator with block time - step , which runs on graphic processing units ( gpus ) , fully exploiting the advantages of parallel machines .",
    "in all the simulations performed , the mw is modelled as an external , analytical , field , whereas the fornax dsph and all the gcs have been represented self - consistently as @xmath0 `` particles '' . the number of particles that should be used for modelling the whole dsph exceeds @xmath8 , which is too much to allow a reasonable computational time . to overcome this problem , we : i ) limited the representation of the galaxy to an inner region of @xmath9 kpc , as explained more in detail below , and , ii ) , we allowed a difference between the individual mass of the particles in the dsph , @xmath10 , and in the gcs , @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 .",
    "this implies a number of particles which is , in the smallest cluster , greater than @xmath13 .",
    "the evaporation time , which is the time - scale over which two - body relaxation is at all important , is @xmath9 gyr for the smallest cluster .",
    "consequently , the evaporation time for all the clusters is significantly larger than the time over which they reach the fornax centre , thus avoiding possible spurious effects of relaxation due to an exceedingly small number of particles .",
    "the mw tidal field was modelled with the @xcite density profile , given by the sum of three different components , bulge , disk and halo .",
    "the galactic bulge is represented as a plummer sphere @xcite : @xmath14    the galactic disk is represented by a @xcite law :    @xmath15    and the halo is described by a @xcite profile : @xmath16,\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is defined as :    @xmath18.\\ ] ]    in eq.s ( 14 ) , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are scale lengths , while @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are masses , all listed in table [ astab ] .",

    "looking at the figureit is evident that tidal forces have significantly acted on cluster gc1 , gc2 and gc5 .",

    "if we look at the gcs as a whole , which is shown in the top left panel of the figure , we find that gcs merging have produced a quite evident central structure , which is orbited by 3 small clumps , relics of gc1 , gc2 and gc5 .",

    "gc1 and gc5 are clearly disrupted by tidal forces , whereas gc2 , gc3 and gc4 resist during their decay to the fornax centre .",
    "in particular , it is worth noting that most of the mass lost by gc5 is deposited , after @xmath123 gyr , into the fornax tidal tail , contributing significantly to its enhancement .        in figure",
    "[ hysto ] , we compare the number distribution of the gcs particles as a function of their distances from the fornax centre , for both model d05 and d1 . it is evident that in model d1 the gc5 cluster is completely disrupted , with some of its debris dispersed on distances beyond @xmath138 kpc .",
    "+   +    surprisingly , we found that none of the clusters can deposit mass in the innermost region of fornax ( @xmath139 pc ) .",
    "indeed , the gcs debris seem to distribute around a sort of `` hole '' .    actually , this region is not really empty , since it contains background stars .",
    "actually , it seems that the high density of the background prevents the deposit of mass in the innermost region of the galaxy .",
    "hence , the background steep density profile acts as a mbh does in bright galaxies , suppressing the formation of a nucleus .    indeed , a comparative look at the time evolution of the gc radial positions and masses ( fig .",
    "[ traj1 ] ) shows that gc1 and gc2 are disrupted within 0.3 gyr , well before they reach the inner 100 pc of the fornax .",
    "also gc5 is almost completely disrupted from tidal forces in 0.5 gyr .",
    "clusters gc3 and gc4 , instead , are able to reach the innermost region of the galaxy , though they suffer a loss of more than @xmath140 of their initial masses .    , but for model d1.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + , but for model d1.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the efficiency of tidal forces is well evident in figure [ mr1 ] , which shows the cumulative mass distribution of the gcs at different times .",

    "in model d05 , the gc orbital decay gives rise to a well evident nucleus , whose surface density profile exceeds @xmath141 times the background density . in particular , we show in figure [ d05mas ] the cumulative radial mass distribution at @xmath142 and after @xmath123 gyr for the whole system ( fornax+gcs ) .",
    "it is evident that the mass enclosed within @xmath143 pc exceeds @xmath144 m@xmath6 , corresponding to a central density of @xmath145 m@xmath6 pc@xmath146 .",
    "this value is about a hundred times higher than the initial central density of the most massive cluster , gc3 , which is the one that contributes mostly to the nc formation .    as known , during their evolution gcs undergo mass segregation , which can lead to the formation of massive sub - systems in their cores , mainly composed by stellar bhs ( see for example @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of such systems depend on the cluster properties and may lead , in some cases , to the formation of a massive black hole seed .",
    "this formation process has been usually invoked to explain the formation of the so - called intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) , with masses ranging between @xmath147 m@xmath6 , in dense and massive star clusters @xcite .    in particular , for metal poor systems , @xcite has shown that mass segregation drives the formation of a massive central system of evolved stars composed for @xmath148 by stellar bhs .",
    "dynamical interactions among these bhs possibly leads to the formation of an imbh seed upon certain conditions @xcite but , in other cases , they can survive within the gc centre up to a hubble time @xcite .    in any case",
    ", the formation of a dense sub - cluster of dark objects or an imbh seed as a consequence of mass segregation and strong dynamical interactions is a process with typical time scales that increase at increasing the mass of the host system .",
    "indeed , this process occurs over several times the relaxation time - scale , which , approximately , scales with the host mass .",
    "for instance , for a typical galactic nucleus , the time - scale for such process easily exceeds a hubble time .",
    "however , it is considerably smaller for smaller star clusters .    in this framework",
    ", our results can be used to investigate whether the orbital decay can lead to the formation , within the fornax centre , of a massive black hole seed . as shown in figure [ gcs05 ]",
    ", the formation of a nc is mainly due to the orbital decay of clusters gc3 and gc4 .",
    "the scaling relation provided by @xcite , suggests that these two metal poor clusters should host at their centre two massive systems mainly composed of heavy stellar remnants , with masses of @xmath149 m@xmath6 and @xmath150 m@xmath6 , respectively , and sizes of @xmath151 pc .    in their current version",
    ", our simulations can not be used to follow stellar collisions , then we can not state anything about the possible formation process of an imbh .",
    "however , we can guess something about the possible accumulation of stellar bhs in the fornax centre .",
    "indeed , on a side we know that mass segregation will lead to a significant deposit of heavy stellar bhs in the centre of the infalling gcs , while on the other side we know from figure [ hysto ] that the particles that are deposited into the fornax centre are those moving in the innermost region of the host cluster . therefore , we expect that during the gcs merging their cores , composed mainly of heavy stellar remnants , will collide together .",
    "the subsequent increase in the surrounding density can turn on a phase of strong dynamical interactions , that can rapidly lead to the formation of a seed , as suggested by @xcite .    on the other hand , if at least one of the infalling gcs hosts a imbh , which has formed during its past evolution , it should settle at the fornax center due to dynamical friction , and subsequently may undergo a slow accretion phase .    it should be noted that if the imbh is transported to the galactic centre by the infalling cluster , its mass will not scale with the host galaxy mass as expected for super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , since in this case the central black hole would be significantly lighter . indeed , for a fornax - like system the expected mass for a central smbh would be @xmath152 m@xmath6 , according to the scaling relation provided by @xcite , @xmath1 times heavier the mass of the infalling gc imbh . of course , such small imbh would have poor effects on the surrounding nucleus , making its identification even more difficult .",
    "hence , if the dsph is characterised by a flat core or a shallow cusp at its formation , the decay and merging of its gcs can transport a significant amount of matter toward the galactic centre , causing an increase in the central density that can potentially favour the formation , or accretion , of a massive black hole . on the other hand",
    ", it should be noted that among all the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group , only the sagittarius dsph likely displays a nucleus in its centre , despite its origin is still poorly understood . in this framework ,",
    "hence , the absence of bright nuclei in dsphs would imply the absence of central massive black holes but , at the same time , the possible future formation of such nuclei can facilitate the formation of a central imbh .",
    "gyr for model d05.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper we showed that the density profile of the fornax dsph plays a fundamental role in determining the fate of its gcs .",
    "indeed , we found that if fornax is characterised by a steep density profile , its gcs will likely be disrupted in @xmath27 gyr . on the other hand",
    ", a shallower density profile would allow the formation of a relatively small nc , with a mass few times @xmath153 m@xmath6 .",
    "this allows some inference on the fornax gcs history .",
    "indeed , let s make the , likely , hypothesis that the galaxy hosted , in the past , a larger population of clusters .",
    "the additional gcs should had smaller apocentres than those currently observed , since they should have completely accomplished their orbital decay .",
    "anyway , our results suggest that , even if these gcs existed in the past , the efficient tidal action of the stellar background could have completely dispersed their debris , hiding the presence of any signature of their existence .",
    "this possibility represents an interesting alternative explanation for the the so - called fornax `` _ _ timing problem _ _ '' , which states that is extremely unlikely that we are looking at the gcs just before their final sink to the fornax centre .",
    "indeed , it would imply that a steep stellar cusp in the galaxy centre can halt the formation of a nucleus , disrupting efficiently the infalling clusters and covering their past existence in the galactic background .",
    "these results indicate that a galactic nucleus acts in the same way as smbhs do , shattering the infalling gcs and halting the formation of a central nucleus @xcite .",
    "the effect of gc disruption operated by a steep cusp in the host galaxy density profile may be responsible for the observational absence of ncs in small dwarf galaxies ( with masses around @xmath8 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "interestingly , the absence of a nucleated region can tell us something about the luminous and dark matter content of the smallest , dm dominated , galaxies .",
    "indeed , it is widely believed that dsph galaxies are characterised by large quantities of dm , but with density profiles significantly shallower than what expected by standard cdm paradigm .",
    "this is known as core / cusp problem .",
    "one of the most credited scenario propose that initially a dm halo form with a cuspy density profile , which is subsequently removed by merging events , tidal interaction with a larger galaxy , stellar formation , gas accretion and supernovae ( sn ) explosions ( see for example @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "all these mechanisms can remove the initial dm cusp over time - scales of the order of few gyr , leaving the dsph with a nearly cored density profile , or , at least , a mild cusp ( @xmath154 ) .    in a recent work , @xcite have shown that sn feedback and star formation drives the formation of a core on a time @xmath155 gyr , a time which is fully compatible with the time - scale over which gcs orbital decay can occur .",
    "this may imply that cusp / core transformation is a complex process in which several different processes act together with an efficiency that likely depends on the host galaxy properties .    moreover , another outcome of our results that can be related to the cusp / core problem is the following .",
    "looking at model d05 , we demonstrated that the future orbital decay of gcs will likely drive the formation of a nc , well visible as an edge in the surface density distribution .",
    "however , no clear signature of an nc is found in model d1 . indeed , looking closer to the fornax centre , we found that its spatial density profile seems to flatten , as shown in figure [ d1rho ] .",
    "surprisingly , a best - fit of the density profile with a dehnen model reveals two important modifications of the profile : i ) the scale radius decreases , passing from @xmath156 to @xmath157 pc and ii ) the inner slope @xmath158 significantly decreases , passing from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the early orbital decay of gcs in dm dominated dsph seems to be a complementary explanation for the core / cusp problem .",
    "this possible solution to the problem seems very general , as observations indicate that gc formation is an ubiquitous process occurring in all the galaxies .",
    "this alternative process for the cusp removal was firstly proposed by @xcite and @xcite . in particular , @xcite demonstrated that very massive , point - like satellites can remove the cusp in dm halos at very low densities ( @xmath161 m@xmath6 pc@xmath146 ) .    despite the mechanism observed in our simulations",
    "is analogous to the one discovered by @xcite , the crucial difference is that in this case it acts on relatively smaller scales , shaping the properties of dsph - sized systems .",
    "moreover , our results suggest that cusp / core transition can be operated by the orbital decay of `` normal '' gcs , with masses @xmath162 m@xmath6 .",
    "more in detail , the models presented here are different , for three main reasons :    * we modelled each gc using a reliable mass function as suggested by observations ; * we modelled each gc by a sample of particles , thus accounting for their internal dynamics and their response to external tidal forces ; * we modelled the evolution of relatively light gcs , with masses below @xmath163 m@xmath6 , traversing a cuspy galaxy with typical density @xmath164 m@xmath6 pc@xmath146 .    even in such different conditions",
    "our results show that the sinking gcs can remove efficiently the cusp of a dm dominated dsph .     and",
    "@xmath165 gyr in model d1 .",
    "the initial cusp significantly flattens by the end of the simulation.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper we investigated the future evolution of the five gcs observed in the fornax dsph .",
    "our results suggest that the gcs orbital decay can lead to a detectable nc only if the galaxy has a density profile shallower than @xmath166 .",
    "otherwise , the galactic density cusp acts as a tidal heater , efficiently disrupting the incoming clusters before they can reach the galactic center and deposit mass therein to give rise to a detectable nucleus .    extending our results to a generic dsph",
    "that host some gcs close to its centre , we have shown that the gc infall can facilitate the accumulation of stellar bhs within the galactic central region , as well as of an imbh formed during the past gc evolution .",
    "this would have implications on the possible bh - galaxy mass scaling relation , since for dsph the central black holes would be significantly lighter than expected , and hardly detectable through usual `` dynamical estimators '' , such as the projected velocity dispersion @xcite . moreover , we have shown that if the dsph has a steep cusp at its birth , as expected by cosmological simulations , clusters traversing the galactic region are efficiently disrupted by tidal forces , thus quenching the formation of an nc .",
    "this would explain the absence of bright nuclei in the dsphs in the local group .",
    "indeed , one possible path to the dsph formation and evolution is the following :    * the dsph forms with a steep cusp in the density profile and some gcs form following the overall galactic distribution ; * due to dynamical friction and tidal forces , loose gcs moving on inner orbits are efficiently disrupted , leaving almost untouched only those moving out of the galaxy scale radius ; * the cusp distribution transforms into a cored one , as a consequence of some process , as explained in section [ discussion ] ; * the surviving clusters undergo dynamical friction and , due to the reduced efficiency of tidal forces , eventually reach the galactic centre and drive the formation of a bright nucleus .    in this picture",
    ", the gcs tidal disruption could represent an efficient process for transforming the cuspy profile into a flatter one , as shown in the previous section .    in the following",
    ", we briefly summarize the main outcomes of this work :    * using highly - resolved , direct , @xmath0-body simulations , based on observations of the fornax dsph , we modelled the evolution of a globular cluster system within the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , representing in a reliable way both the clusters and the parent galaxy ; * we have shown that if the dsph has a shallow cusp in the density profile , the gc orbital decay leads to the formation of a detectable nucleus over a time - scale of @xmath125 gyr , with properties similar to those expected by extrapolation of observational scaling relations valid for heavier galaxies ; * on the other hand , if the dsph has a cuspy density profile , as suggested by cdm predictions , tidal forces are strong enough to disrupt the infalling clusters , thus preventing the formation of a nc ; * in the case of nearly cored dsphs , we expect that gc decay and merging can favour the formation of a imbh , especially if one of the gcs contains an imbh previously formed , this would imply a bh - galaxy mass relation substantially steeper at low galaxy mass , with bh masses significantly smaller than expected from observational scaling relations based on heavier galaxies data ; * in the case of cuspy dsphs , instead , we showed that the gcs tidal disruption significantly affects the background mass distribution . in particular , the density profile significantly flattens .",
    "this process can play an interesting role in the solution of the core / cusp problem ; * the missing observational evidence of nuclei in the lg dsphs would imply that dsphs have formed with a steep cusp , thus disrupting all those clusters formed within the galactic scale radius ; after the transformation of the cusp into a core , only the surviving clusters can lead to the formation of a nucleus , but on a significantly longer time - scale , since they formed in an outer region of the galaxy ; * finally , we suggest that dsph may follow a well determined evolutionary path : i ) they form with a steep density profile , ii ) the innermost star clusters are disrupted by tidal forces and , in turn , they flattens the galactic density profile , iii ) at this point , farther gcs can reach the galactic centre and iv ) contribute to the formation of a nucleus . * the clear dearth of bright nuclei in the lg dsph population may indicate that the first part of the evolutionary process ( points i ) and ii ) ) has a very long time , as also suggested by simulations .",
