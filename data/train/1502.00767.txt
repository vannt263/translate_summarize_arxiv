    "there has been huge body of work in engineering and physics literature dealing with the distribution of sizes of fragments , when a large piece of solid is broken into much smaller fragments , driven by its applications in many industrial processes like mining and milling , in geophysics and environmental science @xcite .",
    "the theoretical approaches to modelling fragmentation have generally focussed on the distribution of sizes of fragments .",
    "it is expected that the general form of the distribution would be independent of material details , and may be captured in a simple theoretical model based on some general physical principles . in one of the first theoretical attempts in this direction , mott and linfoot @xcite modelled the fragmentation as caused by",
    "randomly drawn poisson - distributed horizontal and vertical lines .",
    "grady and kipp studied different variants of the mott construction , and their effect on the fragment - size distribution @xcite .",
    "similar ideas were also used by gilvarry @xcite to predict the fragment size distribution .",
    "these have been studied using the chemical reaction rate equations approach @xcite .",
    "several random fuse - network type models for fracture have been developed , where the material is seen as a network of coupled elastic elements , which have random threshold for failure @xcite .",
    "there are also molecular - dynamic simulations of assembly of sub - units , interacting by say lennard - jones interaction , subjected to high - impact projectile , or expansive stress @xcite .",
    "models assuming a fractal structure of defects have also been studied @xcite .    in recent years , there has been a lot of concern about climate change , leading to increased melting of the polar ice , and consequent rise of sea - levels . to make quantitative predictions",
    ", one needs to understand the fragmentation of the the polar ice cap into much smaller iceberg fragments .",
    "this led to recent study of calving glaciers by astrom et al @xcite .",
    "the precise model studied by astrom et al is rather complicated , and has to be solved numerically @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simplified model of stochastic growth of cracks on a two dimensional sheet , which was inspired by these papers .",
    "the cracks have a preferred direction of propagation , but have a random transverse velocity .",
    "there is a finite probability per unit time that the a crack splits into two , which then propagate independently .",
    "if two cracks meet , they merge , and evolve subsequently as a single crack .",
    "the region left behind by the cracks is broken into fragments of different sizes .",
    "an example of the fragments generated in our model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this model was studied earlier by ben avraham et al @xcite as a model of particles with diffusion , aggregation and birth .",
    "they noted that the detailed balance condition is satisfied , and hence the steady state is easily written down , and showed that the spacing distribution between consecutive particles satisfies a linear equation , and hence can be determined .",
    "the evolution operator for this model reduces to the hamiltonian of a quantum xy spin model , which well known to be diagonalizable exactly in terms of free fermions @xcite . viewed as a model of fragmentation",
    ", geometrical questions about fragment - size distribution and correlations seem quite natural , but these have not been discussed before .",
    "a model rather similar in spirit was discussed earlier by inaoka and takayasu @xcite , but their detailed model is actually quite different , and can only be solved numerically .",
    "our model has the advantage of been analytically tractable , and we are able determine the exact distribution of fragment sizes .",
    "we show that in the limit when the splitting rate is small , there is an exact mapping between our model a ( defined precisely below ) and the directed abelian sandpile model @xcite , which brings out the self - organized origin of the divergence in the fragment - size distribution for small sizes .",
    "in fact , this distribution is the same as that encountered in a rather different model , in which particles aggregate , not undergo fragmentation , also studied by takayasu earlier@xcite .",
    "we start with an intact cylinder with no cracks . at the start",
    ", we introduce one or more cracks at the left boundary . we can define a discrete - time update rule ( model a ) , or continuous - time update rule ( model b ) .",
    "+   + * model a * : we consider the model defined on a square grid , drawn on the surface of semi - infinite cylinder . the sites of the lattice are labelled by integers @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 even .",
    "the neighbours of site @xmath0 are four the sites @xmath4 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions along the cylinder are imposed by identifying @xmath5 , for all @xmath6 .",
    "this corresponds to the axis of the cylinder being in the direction @xmath7 of the lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we consider discrete - time parallel update , where each crack moves inwards with speed @xmath8 .",
    "then , the cracks reach up to distance @xmath9 along the cylinder axis , and we may equivalently think of @xmath9 as the time coordinate . if there is a crack at site @xmath0 , it moves according to the following rule : + a ) with probability @xmath10 , it splits into two cracks , and these cracks go to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "clearly , @xmath13 .",
    "+ b ) if the crack does not split , it moves to any one of the two forward neighbours @xmath11 or @xmath12 with equal probability .",
    "+ c ) if two cracks reach a site , they merge , and move as a single crack .",
    "+   + * model b * : here we consider the time - coordinate @xmath9 to be a continuous variable , @xmath14 , but the spatial coordinate is still discrete , @xmath15 , with periodic boundary conditions @xmath16 .",
    "a configuration at time @xmath9 is specified by the occupation numbers @xmath17 , where @xmath18 takes values @xmath8 and @xmath19 , depending on whether there is a crack at @xmath20 at time @xmath9 or not .    the configurations @xmath17 undergo continuous - time markovian evolution with the following rates : + a ) a crack at position @xmath20 jumps to site @xmath21 with rate @xmath8 , if @xmath21 is a nearest neighbour of @xmath20 .",
    "+ b ) an empty neighbour @xmath21 of an occupied site @xmath20 becomes occupied with rate @xmath10 , due to crack - splitting at @xmath20 .",
    "+ c ) if a crack arrives at a site already occupied by a crack , it merges with it , and the state of the site does not change .",
    "if we represent the configuration by a bit string , e.g. @xmath22 , the transition rates are given by the equations    @xmath23    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows a schematic time - history of evolution in this case .",
    "in our model , the number of cracks at any given time ( equivalently at distance along the axis of the cylinder ) is not conserved .",
    "so long as at the start of the configuration @xmath24 , there is at least one crack , as the cracks propagate along the cylinder , they may split . or merge , and for large times , there is a non - trivial steady state of the system with a non - zero density @xmath25 of cracks , and a finite mean area per fragment .",
    "we now determine the this steady state , and the asymptotic density .",
    "+   + * model a * : let us label the bonds of the lattice by coordinates of their midpoints .",
    "then a bond has coordinates @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are any integers , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the configuration @xmath31 of cracks is specified by giving the occupation numbers @xmath32 of all the bonds , where @xmath33 , if the bond @xmath26 is occupied by a crack , and zero otherwise .",
    "the restriction of @xmath31 to vertical row @xmath9 will be denoted by @xmath34    we can think of the set @xmath35 as the evolution history of a set of @xmath36 ising spins on a line , undergoing stochastic markovian dynamics . here",
    "@xmath37 is @xmath38 if the m - th spin is up at time @xmath9 , and zero otherwise . in this formulation ,",
    "the markovian evolution is defined as follows : at odd times , we consider pairs of adjacent spins @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "these evolve according to the following rules : + a ) @xmath40 $ ] remains unchanged .",
    "+ b ) if @xmath41",
    "\\neq [ 0,0]$ ] , it is reset to @xmath42 or @xmath7 with probabilities @xmath43 respectively .    at even times",
    "@xmath9 , we apply the same rule , but choose the pairs to be @xmath44 $ ] .    now , we specify the state of the system at time @xmath9 , by giving a probability measure on the space of spin configurations .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the probability that the configuration of ising spins at time @xmath9 will be found to be @xmath34 .",
    "note that there are @xmath46 allowed values of @xmath34 , as the configuration with all spins down is not reached in the steady state , if we start with at least one crack present at @xmath47 .",
    "the master equation for the evolution of @xmath48 is @xmath49~~ { \\rm prob}({\\bf \\sigma}_t)\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the markov transition matrix .",
    "we note that the transition rates here satisfy the detailed balance condition corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "there are @xmath53 states , and @xmath50 is a @xmath54 matrix .",
    "there are two steady state eigenvectors : one in which there are no cracks , and one in which a configuration with @xmath28 cracks has a probability proportional to @xmath55 .    *",
    "model b * : in this case , the analysis is simpler .",
    "we note that probability of transition of the state of two adjacent sites from the state @xmath56 to @xmath57 is @xmath58 , but the rate of transition from @xmath57 to @xmath56 is @xmath8 .",
    "also , there is a rate @xmath8 for the transition @xmath56 to @xmath59 , and vice - versa .",
    "then , detailed balance is clearly satisfied , for the hamiltonian function given by eq.([eqh ] ) , with @xmath60 .",
    "we first discuss the model a. the cracks divide the plane into fragments of different sizes .",
    "we note that each fragment is a polygon having a unique starting point , and a unique end - point which are the boundary sites with minimum and maximum values of the time - coordinate respectively .",
    "the boundary itself consists of two directed walks .",
    "these shapes are known as staircase polygons in literature .",
    "the left boundary of the fragment is a simple directed biassed random walk , where the step occurs to the right with probability @xmath61 , and to the left with probability @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , the right boundary is an independent walk with step to the left with probability @xmath61 , and step to the right occurs with probability @xmath63 .",
    "the fragment ends when these two boundaries meet .",
    "consider the stochastic evolution of the system .",
    "suppose there is a tip - splitting event at some site @xmath64 , which starts a new fragment .",
    "let @xmath65 be the probability that this fragment will have area @xmath66 . for small @xmath66 ,",
    "these are easily determined by explicit enumeration of possible shapes .",
    "for example , consider a fragment starting at @xmath64 .",
    "we can have @xmath67 , only if the fragment boundary , when at the site @xmath68 takes the next step to the left , and the boundary , when at @xmath69 takes the next step to the right .",
    "thus we have @xmath70 . similarly , @xmath71 .",
    "more generally , if a given fragment shape @xmath72 has perimeter @xmath73 , it occurs with a probability @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the question of finding @xmath75 for general @xmath66 is reduced to the finding the number of different staircase polygons of area @xmath66 .",
    "this has studied earlier by prellberg@xcite , and prellberg and brak @xcite .",
    "let the number of a staircase polygon having @xmath76 horizontal bonds , and @xmath77 vertical bonds , and area @xmath66 be @xmath78 .",
    "we define the generating function @xmath79    prellberg showed that @xmath80 satisfies a functional equation , and used it to determine @xmath81 exactly .",
    "one gets @xmath82\\ ] ] where @xmath83 with @xmath84    these explicit formulas are a bit complicated .",
    "these simplify in the continuum limit , corresponding to @xmath85 .",
    "the continuum problem of determining the probability distribution of area in a brownian bridge has been studied in @xcite .",
    "they showed that in this case , the distribution function @xmath86 is the airy distribution . for small @xmath10",
    ", @xmath86 has the scaling form @xmath87    in the limit @xmath85 , and fixed @xmath66 , @xmath86 tends to a non - zero value . in this case , the boundaries of the fragment do unbiased random walk , and the corresponding probabilities are exactly as found in the directed abelian sandpile model in 2-dimensions @xcite . for this case ,",
    "simple dimensional arguments already show that @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the probability that adding a grain in the steady state of 2-dimensional directed abelian sandpile model will cause an avalanche with exactly @xmath66 topplings @xcite .",
    "it is known that @xmath91 for large @xmath66 , we must have @xmath92 for large @xmath20 , the airy distribution , @xmath93 decreases as @xmath94 @xcite . in the literature , there has been some discussion about the size - distribution having exponential or stretched exponential decay for large sizes @xcite .    note the unusual @xmath95 scaling of the prefactor in eq.([eq : g ] ) .",
    "this arises because the function @xmath93 , which varies as @xmath96 for small @xmath20 is not integrable .",
    "then , if we take the scaling limit @xmath97 we have to impose a cut - off of @xmath98 on the lower limit of the integral . then the integral diverges as @xmath99 , which cancels the extra power of @xmath58 in the eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) .    for finite but small @xmath10 , the mean density of cracks varies as @xmath100 , and the average longitudinal extent of a fragment scales as @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the mean size of a fragment varies as @xmath102 .",
    "now , we consider model b. let @xmath103 be the probability that a segment of width @xmath27 will generate a fragment with additional area between @xmath66 and @xmath104 .",
    "the laplace transform of this distribution will be denoted by @xmath105 , and is defined by @xmath106    consider the time evolution of a fragment whose transverse size is @xmath27 at some time @xmath107 . in time , the boundaries of this fragment will evolve stochastically , till they merge .",
    "the segment of length @xmath27 can become segment of length @xmath108 , if either end makes a diffusive jump ( with rate @xmath109 for each ) , or if either end creates a new crack which decreases the size of this segment ( total rate @xmath110 ) .",
    "the waiting time @xmath111 before any one of these occurs is an exponentially distributed random variable .",
    "the probability that this occurs between time @xmath111 and @xmath112 given by @xmath113 .",
    "the total area of the fragment is sum of two independent random variables : the area @xmath114 up to this time , and remainder area @xmath115 .",
    "the remainder has starting length @xmath116 with probability @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , with probability @xmath119 .",
    "this gives @xmath120 \\left [ p_{_+}~ \\tilde{p}(s , m+1 ) + p_{_-}~ \\tilde{p}(s , m-1)\\right]\\ ] ] which simplifies to @xmath121    write @xmath122 . then @xmath123 satisfies the equation of the form @xmath124\\ ] ] which is a discrete variant of the airy equation . in the continuum limit of small @xmath10",
    ", it reduces to the airy equation , and the scaling form of the fragment distribution is the same as studied in @xcite .",
    "this model has the remarkable property that two fragment starting at any two sites @xmath125 and @xmath126 are completely uncorrelated , unless they are actually touching each other .",
    "this is true not only for their area , but also their shapes .",
    "this lack of correlations between fragments is very surprizing , in view of the fact that the condition that the arrangement of fragments has to tile the plane imposes very strong geometrical constraints on their shapes .",
    "the probability that a fragment starting at @xmath125 will have a given have any given shape @xmath72 , depends only on @xmath72 , and is completely independent of the state of other sites at time @xmath111 .",
    "if there is another crack that comes near this crack , at best it can merge with this fragment s boundary , but this will not influence its subsequent motion .    we have hitherto considered all cracks moving into the unfragmented region with unit speed . this assumption is not really necessary . at the start of the simulation , we can assign to each site a random variable , taking one of three possible possible values , which tells what would happen if a crack reaches that site : will it split into two , or go left unsplit , or go right unsplit . then",
    ", we can start with any configuration of cracks at the boundary on the left , and evolve cracks in any order , and the final configuration is independent of the order in which the cracks are updated , and the waiting time between these updates .",
    "this kind of  ultra - locality \" of cluster shapes is also seen in percolation models , where the shapes of two percolation clusters are perfectly uncorrelated , unless they have a common boundary .",
    "the present model may also be seen as a model of this type .",
    "this property is much less obvious , if we look at the transfer matrix of the model .",
    "consider the configuration of a particular column @xmath107 .",
    "we assume that a crack - splitting occurs at a point @xmath64 .",
    "the probability that the generated fargment with @xmath127 as its left - most point has area @xmath66 , denoted by @xmath65 above , would in general be expressible in terms the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix , and matrix elements of some projection operators between eigenvectors . that this probability does not depend on the starting vector , so long as a splitting occurs at @xmath64 , requires the transfer matrix to have very special structure .",
    "for example , the transfer matrix @xmath50 can be written as @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the matrices cooresponding to evolution at odd and even times . but @xmath130 can be written as a direct product of @xmath131 @xmath132 matrices , where each matrix gives the transition probabilities from the state of a pair of adjacent sites @xmath133 to the state @xmath134 . each of these is the configuration basis is easily seen to be of the form +      where @xmath136",
    ". clearly , the rank of @xmath130 , and hence of @xmath50 is at most @xmath137 . out of the @xmath138 eigenvalues of @xmath131 , at least @xmath139 are exactly zero .",
    "the large number of zero eigenvalues provides the mathematical mechanism underlying the the ultra - locality in this model .",
