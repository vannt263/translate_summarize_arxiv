    "[ fig : planosdonadores ] the difference ( bulk @xmath58 interface ) between the two to show explicitly the changes at different frequencies .    in fig .",

    "-atomic layer ldos when in bulk and at the interface . in ( a ) right at the interface and ( b ) on the third layer from the interface .",
    "in this work , we have considered twelve ideal non - reconstructed interfaces ( 001)@xmath62 with @xmath63 and calculated the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "the interfaces considered , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where chain ( plane ) refers to interfaces where the contact with the semiconductor is with the chain @xmath32 plane ( @xmath45 plane ) of @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath34 stands for @xmath9 or @xmath8 . the order in which they appear in this work , as @xmath68",
    ", for example , means that the interface begins with an atomic plane of @xmath8 atoms at the semiconductor side .",
    "we distinguish between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , meaning that in the last case , the @xmath7 atoms face the oxigen atoms of the @xmath32 chains .",
    "the main conclusion is that all the interfaces considered present several planes on the semiconductor side that are metallic .",
    "this behavior attenuates slowly and end at the fith layer where the material behaves back as a semiconductor .",
