    "<S> we study inflation in the framework of @xmath0-gravity in the presence of a canonical scalar field . after reviewing the basic equations governing the background cosmology in @xmath0-gravity </S>",
    "<S> , we turn to study the cosmological perturbations and obtain the evolutionary equations for the scalar and tensor perturbations . solving those equations , we find the power spectra for the scalar and tensor perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider a power - law @xmath0 function and investigate the inflationary models with the power - law and intermediate scale factors . </S>",
    "<S> we see that in contrast with the standard inflationary scenario based on the einstein gravity , the power - law and intermediate inflationary models in @xmath0-gravity can be compatible with the observational results of planck 2015 at 68% cl . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in our @xmath0 setting , the potentials responsible for the both power - law and intermediate inflationary models have the power - law form @xmath1 but the power @xmath2 is different for them . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can refine some of power - law inflationary potentials in the framework of @xmath0-gravity while they are disfavored by the observational data in the standard inflationary scenario . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , is that the self - interacting quartic potential @xmath3 which has special reheating properties , can be consistent with the planck 2015 data in our @xmath0 scenario while it is ruled out in the standard inflationary scenario . </S>",
