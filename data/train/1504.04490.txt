    "slowly pulsating b - type ( spb ) stars are main - sequence objects pulsating in high - order gravity modes .",
    "the observational properties of the spb stars were broadly discussed , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these modes are driven by the classical @xmath7-mechanism operating in the metal opacity bump @xcite .",
    "there are three basic problems which complicate the interpretation of the spb pulsations and make seismic modelling of these pulsators particularly difficult .",
    "first , their oscillation spectra obtained from ground - based observations are usually sparse and lack equidistant patterns .",
    "therefore , the only way to identify pulsation modes , i.e. , to determine the spherical harmonic degree , @xmath0 , and the azimuthal order , @xmath1 , is the use of the information contained in the light and/or line profile variations .",
    "the exceptions are the stars observed from space , which have oscillation spectra with hundreds of frequency peaks and with some clear structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most popular tools derived from ground - based observations and used for mode identification are the amplitude ratios and phase differences in various photometric passbands @xcite , because these data are much more easily obtained than the line profiles .",
    "the amplitude ratios and phase differences in different passbands were called the photometric non - adiabatic observables by @xcite , who improved this method for @xmath8 cephei stars by including non - adiabatic effects in their pulsational computations .",
    "if all effects of rotation are ignored , these observables are independent of the azimuthal order , @xmath1 , and inclination angle , @xmath5 , and modes with different harmonic degrees , @xmath0 , occupy disjoint regions on the amplitude ratio versus phase difference diagrams .",
    "the results for non - rotating spb stellar models were presented for the first time by @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the mode degree , @xmath0 , and azimuthal order , @xmath1 , can be extracted from spectroscopic observations as well . for details on the spectroscopic methods , we refer to , e.g.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "some of these methods take into account the effects of the coriolis force ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but only to the first order and therefore they do not apply to low - frequency g modes .",
    "the traditional approximation was applied only in the moment method by @xcite to a few spb stars .",
    "the most recent overview of the spectroscopic methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second problem is associated with a very high density of the theoretical oscillation spectra of spb stellar models .",
    "for this reason , the assignment of the radial order , @xmath2 , to the individual observed peaks is usually impossible or can lead to the misinterpretation of the data .",
    "for example , @xcite claimed that they have discovered a series of dipole zonal modes equidistant in period in the spb star hd50230 .",
    "our findings , however , contradict this result @xcite .",
    "we showed that this equidistant pattern is rather accidental and its interpretation in terms of the asymptotic theory is dubious .",
    "the third problem with the interpretation of pulsations in spb stars is rotation , which significantly changes , both , the equilibrium model and pulsational properties . in the case of these pulsators ,",
    "rotation plays an especially important role because even at slow rotation pulsational frequencies can be of the order of the rotational frequency and the effect of the coriolis force can not be neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of centrifugal deformation on g modes is small @xcite .",
    "the influence of rotation on long - period g modes was examined relying on the so - called traditional approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or on the truncated expansion in legendre functions for the eigenfunctions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , the mode identification for spb stars has been made mostly in the zero - rotation approximation , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite , and the results indicated that most of these stars pulsate in dipole modes .",
    "the only spb star for which the effects of rotation were included in the photometric method of mode identification was @xmath9 eri @xcite .",
    "this identification was based on linear non - adiabatic calculations with the effects of rotation treated in the traditional approximation .",
    "therefore , there is a need for this type of studies and the main goal of the present work is to make mode identification with the effects of rotation taken into account for all spb stars with available and appropriate photometric and/or spectroscopic data .",
    "uniform rotation is assumed .",
    "we follow the method used in @xcite , which , in addition , allows us to constrain also the rotational velocity of our programme stars . for comparison , we make also mode identification in the zero - rotation approximation .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section2 ,",
    "we present observational data of selected spb stars gathered from the literature , and the luminosities and evolutionary masses determined by us . in section3 , the methods of mode identification we use , dependence on model parameters and the results are discussed .",
    "we end with a summary in the last section .",
    "we selected 31 spb stars for which the data needed to put a star on the h  r diagram and perform mode identification were available .",
    "the hd numbers of the stars and their stellar parameters are given in table[spb_param ] .",
    "all the parameters , except the masses and luminosities , were taken from the literature .",
    "if there were no determinations of the metallicity or colour excess , the solar value @xmath10 @xcite and 0mag were assumed , respectively . in the case of hd28114 , the colour excess , @xmath11 , in",
    "the johnson filters was computed from the colour excess , @xmath12 , in the strmgren filters @xcite . for the star hd179588 ,",
    "@xcite give the value of the interstellar extinction in the johnson @xmath13 filter , @xmath14 .",
    "to obtain @xmath11 , we assumed the standard value of the ratio of total to selective extinction , equal to 3.1 .",
    "the values of luminosity were determined in this paper using the bolometric corrections from @xcite .",
    "stellar masses were derived from evolutionary tracks and they usually correspond to the values of luminosity and effective temperature from the centre of the error box .",
    "there are three exceptions : hd74195 , hd85953 and hd123515 .",
    "the masses of these stars come from models which lie on the left bottom edges of the error boxes , so that they have the following values of the effective temperature and luminosity : @xmath15=4.243 , @xmath16=3.323 for hd74195 , @xmath15=4.312 , @xmath16=3.833 for hd85953 , and @xmath15=4.081 , @xmath16=2.484 for hd123515 .",
    "this is because the models from the centres of the error boxes for these three stars are located outside the main sequence .",
    "since g modes are strongly damped after the main - sequence evolutionary stage , it is rather improbable that these stars have already left the main sequence .",
    "the evolutionary computations were performed using the warsaw - new jersey evolutionary code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the op opacity tables @xcite and the latest heavy element mixture of @xcite ( hereafter agss09 ) .",
    "we assumed the initial hydrogen abundance @xmath17 , the metallicities determined from observations ( column 7 , table [ spb_param ] ) and the equatorial rotational velocities equal to the measured projected value ( column 9 , table [ spb_param ] ) .",
    "overshooting from convective core was not taken into account .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of mode identification for the remaining programme stars are presented in table[tab_results_all ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the best constraints on ( @xmath3 ) and the rotational velocity were obtained for the stars with the measured radial velocity variations .",
    "most of the stars we studied in this paper pulsate in the normal modes .",
    "there are two exceptions : @xmath18 in hd28475 and @xmath19 in hd206540 which may be either an r mode or a normal g mode .    in the case of @xmath20 in hd53921",
    "( identification with and without rotation ) , @xmath20 in hd37151 ( identification without rotation ) and @xmath18 in hd179588 ( identification with and without rotation ) , we are not able to find solutions with @xmath211.5 and therefore we accepted higher values of @xmath22 ( indicated in table [ tab_results_all ] with an exclamation mark for @xmath23=3.3 which corresponds to the probability that real solution has higher @xmath22 equal to 1 per cent or by a double exclamation mark for @xmath23=4.6 which corresponds to the probability that real solution has higher @xmath22 equal to 0.1 per cent ) .",
    "we would like to remind that these quantities should be treated more like arbitrarily chosen thresholds than a strict statistical approach .",
    "in the case of spectroscopic binaries , it was checked whether the pulsation frequency can be a multiple of the orbital frequency . only for the frequency @xmath20 in the star hd177863 ,",
    "the ratio of the pulsation frequency to the orbital frequency , equal to 10.016@xmath240.001 , is close , but still not equal to , within observational error , the integer .",
    "a possibility that this mode is excited by tidal forces was studied by @xcite but they did not conclude which mechanism , classical @xmath7 or tidal forces , is responsible for driving this mode .",
    "another possibility is that some observed frequencies are the result of rotational modulation due chemical and/or temperature inhomogeneities .",
    "the frequencies which fall in the rotational frequency range determined by us are : @xmath20 and @xmath18 in hd74560 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 in hd123515 , @xmath18 in hd208057 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 in hd28114 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 in hd28475 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 in hd34798 , all frequencies of hd37151 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 in hd45284 , all frequencies of hd143309 , @xmath20 in hd179588 , all frequencies of hd191295 and hd206540 .",
    "we presume that most of these frequencies are of pulsational origin , but it must be remembered that pulsational and rotational variability can coexist in one star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and even spots alone could cause multi - periodic signal if the stellar surface rotates differentially ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , to decide with certainty , a detailed abundance analysis from high - resolution spectroscopy is necessary .    for some stars with spectroscopic data , viz .",
    "hd25558 , hd74195 and hd182255 , we were unable to find solutions which reproduce the observed amplitude of the radial velocity variations to within a 1@xmath26 error . therefore , we accepted solutions to within 2@xmath26 or even 6@xmath26 ( see table[tab_results_all ] ) .",
    "this can be caused by model uncertainties ( e.g. model atmospheres , chemical composition , opacities , etc . as well as the approach of computing stellar pulsations ) or observational data ( e.g. underestimated errors of radial velocity amplitudes or fundamental parameters constrained with too low precision ) .",
    "similarly , not always we were able to find a common range of the rotational velocity for all modes of a given star .",
    "the stars in question are : hd123515 , hd179588 , hd208057 , and for these stars we followed the case of model#3 of our working example hd21071 , i.e. , for a given frequency we choose a mode with the range of @xmath27 closest to the range of @xmath27 obtained for other frequencies observed in the star ( they are printed in italic in table[tab_results_all ] ) .    finally , in some cases the identifications of the mode degree in the zero - rotation approximation and the traditional approximation did not agree with each other .",
    "an example is hd25558 . for this star ,",
    "both methods indicate that @xmath20 is a dipole mode , but @xmath19 is a mode with @xmath0=1 , 2 or 3 when the zero - rotation approximation is used or @xmath0=4 , 6 when the traditional approximation is used .",
    "this is not surprising because rotation strongly modifies properties of pulsational modes of the spb stars .",
    "in particular , rotation changes the frequency domain of the unstable modes .",
    "this phenomenon is especially pronounced for high values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    in the last column of table[tab_results_all ] , we listed for five stars spectroscopic determinations of @xmath30 taken from the literature ( de cat et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the case of hd24587 , hd92287 and hd181558 ,",
    "our mode identification is in agreement with the angular numbers found by de cat et al .",
    "( 2005 ) but for hd140873 and hd177863 the results are in contradiction . however , if we look at solutions within 3@xmath26 in @xmath31 for @xmath20 in hd177863 , the modes ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,+1 ) are also possible and the last one agrees with the determinations of de cat et al ( 2005 ) . in the case of @xmath20 in hd140873 , we are dealing with a similar situation but the agreement is achieved within 4@xmath26 in @xmath31 and the only additional solution is the mode ( 1,+1 ) . on the other hand , it should be noted that both stars are visual and spectroscopic binaries and photometric as well as spectroscopic observations can be polluted by the light from the companions , and different methods can be sensitive to this effect in different ways . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath20 in hd177863 is tidally excited , then according to @xcite it should be a quadrupole sectoral mode .",
    "unfortunately , for hd21071 , which is the best studied star by us in the sample , there are no determinations of angular numbers in the literature from the spectroscopic methods and we can not compare our results . there is only the identification of the harmonic degree from the photometric method .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath20 is a dipole mode what is in agreement with our result .",
    "for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath25 , they found that these frequencies can be associated with dipole or quadrupole modes and these results are also compatible with our identifications .",
    "the only discrepancy is that according to @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath25 can be also the @xmath32 mode .",
    "in fact , this solution was found also by us but we rejected it because this mode was stable .",
    "we obtained a mode identification or at least constraints on angular numbers ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) for 31 spb stars .",
    "simultaneously , we derived bounds on the rotational velocities of the stars we examined",
    ". it should be noted , that the results delivered by the presented method depend on the model parameters .",
    "it would be very interesting to verify them on the spb stars for which the inclination angle and/or rotation period are known from independent determinations .",
    "we see such prospects in the forthcoming two - colour photometric data from the _ brite _ satellites and follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "to summarize our results , we constructed histograms showing the distributions of the mode degree , @xmath0 , ( fig.[hist_l ] ) , azimuthal order , @xmath1 ( fig.[hist_m ] ) , the intrinsic mode amplitude , @xmath33 ( fig.[hist_eps ] ) , the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( fig.[hist_v ] ) , and the inclination angle , @xmath5 ( fig.[hist_i ] ) . due to the fact that for some frequencies the identification was not unambiguous",
    ", we shall now explain how we have counted the modes with a given value of the mode degree or azimuthal order .",
    "in the case of the modes for which we found @xmath36 combinations of ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) and @xmath0 or @xmath1 occurred @xmath5 times , we counted such angular numbers @xmath37 times .",
    "the histograms for @xmath4 and @xmath5 were constructed in a similar way .",
    "when we neglect all effects of rotation , most of the modes appeared to be dipole modes ( see fig.[hist_l ] ) .",
    "some modes were quadrupole modes and very few had @xmath0 equal to 3 or 4 .",
    "none of the frequencies had @xmath38 or 6 .",
    "if the effects of rotation were included , the number of the dipole modes decreased significantly and number of the quadrupole modes was approximately doubled .",
    "we also obtained slightly larger number of the modes with @xmath0 higher than 2 . despite this , only very few modes had @xmath39 .",
    "one can see also that there were fewer modes with @xmath40 and 5 than modes with @xmath32 and 6 .",
    "this is because the odd degree modes have lower visibility ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from fig.[hist_m",
    "] one can see that zonal modes are quite numerous amongst our sample of the 31 stars .",
    "we have to admit that we do not have any explanation of that fact .",
    "maybe this is the case or it can result from model uncertainties and/or limitations of the method we applied .",
    "the number of sectoral retrograde and prograde modes is about the same and if we count them all , the number of the sectoral modes becomes only slightly smaller than the number of the zonal modes ( cf . the insert of fig.[hist_m ] ) .",
    "some modes with higher values of @xmath1 also happen .    in the method we used ,",
    "the values of the intrinsic mode amplitude , @xmath33 , are derived from observations ( equation 3 ) and used to constrain mode identification .",
    "the histogram for @xmath33 is shown in fig.[hist_eps ] .",
    "an interesting fact is that most values of @xmath33 are much smaller than the adopted upper limit , @xmath41 .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the frequency peaks of @xmath9 eri by @xcite . in the case of our sample of stars , above 60 per cent of the frequency peaks",
    "have @xmath33 below 0.005 . if we limit the sample to the stars with the radial velocity measurements , the number of the frequency peaks with @xmath42 increases to above 80 per cent .    in fig.[hist_v ] , we present a histogram showing the distribution of the values of the rotational velocity we obtained and the projected rotational velocity .",
    "one can see that a substantial number of the programme stars have @xmath43 below 40 km s@xmath44 .",
    "one can observe a quick decrease of the number of stars with large values of @xmath43 , and there are no stars with @xmath43 higher than 160 km s@xmath44 .",
    "the view is quite different when we consider the ` true ' value of the rotational velocity . in the first place ,",
    "stars rotating below 40 km s@xmath44 are not most numerous and there are stars with rotational velocities from the whole range of @xmath45 . the number of stars with @xmath45 in the range 4080 km s@xmath44 is greater by a factor of 2 than that of stars with the smallest rotational velocities . then the number of stars is slowly decreasing with the increasing value of @xmath45 .    the distribution of the projected rotation velocities and rotation velocities of b - type stars can be found in , e.g. @xcite .",
    "although in the cited paper it is shown that the distribution of @xmath46 for the field and cluster stars differ slightly , it is striking that the values of @xmath46 in our sample are lower and the number of stars quickly decreases with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite also showed that most numerous among b - type stars are those rotating with the equatorial velocity equal to about 200 km s@xmath44 . in our sample ,",
    "the most numerous are stars rotating in the range 4080 km s@xmath44 .",
    "such shift in distribution can suggest that spb stars are indeed slower rotators than the other b - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as opposed to @xcite",
    ", @xcite found that the distribution of @xmath46 as well as @xmath45 for b - type stars is bimodal what is not seen in our sample .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that our sample is too small to make any certain conclusions .    finally , in fig.[hist_i ] is presented a distribution of the inclination angle , @xmath5 , we derived for our sample of stars .",
    "one can see that about half of the stars are observed at rather low inclination angle @xmath47 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the stellar rotational axes should be distributed randomly so one would expect rather the flat distribution of @xmath5 but again we have to remind that we are dealing with a small sample and the shape of histogram can be accidental . the other reason could be that we identified so many zonal modes which are best seen from the pole - on direction ( cf .",
    "fig.[hist_m ] ) .",
    "the other explanation is that the assumption of uniform rotation is incorrect and the higher values of @xmath4 ( implying the low values of @xmath5 ) correspond to the deeper layers which are better probed by high - order g modes .",
    "some support for this hypothesis is the fact that there is a comparable population of the sectoral modes which are least cancelled when we look at the equator and there is no increase in the number of stars with the inclination angle close to 90@xmath48 .",
    "this is an interesting explanation but it demands more detailed studies which go beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the unambiguity of mode identification strongly depends on the quality of the photometric and/or spectroscopic data .",
    "the quality of the data is especially important when the effects of rotation are included .",
    "this is due to the fact that contrary to the case of the zero - rotation approximation when we determined only one parameter , @xmath0 , in the case with rotation included we have to obtain additionally the azimuthal order , @xmath1 , and rotational velocity , @xmath27 .",
    "the information contained in the amplitude of the radial velocity variations helps to reduce significantly the number of possible solutions .",
    "thus , combined photometric and spectroscopic data are highly desirable .    in the case of hd123515 , hd179588 and hd208057 as well as in model#3 and model#5 of hd21071 , we failed finding a common range of the rotational velocity for all observed frequencies .",
    "this can be explained in several ways .",
    "first , the accuracy of our pulsational calculations may be insufficient and the theory needs to be improved .",
    "secondly , the formal errors of the amplitudes and phases of the light and radial velocity variations were underestimated .",
    "thirdly , the astrophysical parameters we used , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , were not possible to be constrained with a high precision .",
    "it is also possible that the adopted initial abundance of hydrogen , metallicity or overshooting from the convective core made the starting models inappropriate . and",
    "again , it is possible that our assumption of rigid rotation is not satisfied , so that different @xmath27 ranges for different frequency peaks observed in a star are manifestations of differential rotation .",
    "perhaps all above - mentioned factors play a role simultaneously .",
    "finally , close companions can disrupt photometric and spectroscopic measurements and thus the mode identification .",
    "two of three stars with the high @xmath22 solutions , hd53921 and hd179588 , are visual binary or visual and spectroscopic binary , respectively .",
    "a high value of @xmath22 can also suggest non - pulsational originate of variability .    nevertheless , we see prospects for seismic modelling of the spb stars for which the best constraints on the angular numbers , ( @xmath3 ) and the rotational velocity , @xmath27 , were obtained . only in such cases",
    "one can try to attribute the radial order , @xmath2 , to the observed frequency peaks .",
    "in particular , hd21071 is a promising candidate .",
    "our results of seismic modelling of this star will be presented in a separate paper ( szewczuk & daszyska - daszkiewicz , in preparation ) .",
    "preliminary results has been already presented in @xcite .",
