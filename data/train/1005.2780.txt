    "the use of random walk models in statistical physics dates back to the very earliest days of the subject  @xcite .",
    "they have been used so broadly and pervasively that it is impossible to make proper reference to so big a subject .",
    "the original random walk models were typically ones in which the walker moves via a series of random transitions characterized by finite length scales for each step and finite time scales between transitions . as long as these general features characterize the walk , the mean square displacement of a walker from its point of origin in the absence of a bias , calculated as an average over many randomly generated trajectories , grows linearly with time .",
    "if there is a bias , then the mean square displacement around the average trajectory grows linearly with time .",
    "this linear growth has become the universal identifier of what is known as  normal transport . \"",
    "diffusion is the quintessential macroscopic normal transport mechanism , and is often arrived at by taking appropriate long - time and short - distance limits of random walks  @xcite .",
    "it is then not surprising that any random walk ( or , for that matter , any stochastic process ) that leads to a mean square displacement that does not grow linearly with time is called  anomalous . \"",
    "this characterization is shared by stochastic processes whose mean square displacement grows either sublinearly or superlinearly with time , the former often called  subdiffusive \" and the latter  superdiffusive \" processes . in the world of random walks , subdiffusive behavior is often associated with waiting time distributions between steps that have fat tails , e.g. , that decay as an inverse small power of time  @xcite .",
    "the average time between transitions in this case is infinite . on the other hand , superdiffusive behavior",
    "is typically associated with step length distributions that have fat tails , so that the average distance per step is infinite  @xcite .",
    "lvy flights are well - known examples of such processes  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been considerable interest in formulating stochastic models that can exhibit different types of behavior in different parameter regimes .",
    "more specifically , for example in the context of random walks , it has been observed in a variety of contexts that the behavior of a walker may be normal in some parameter regimes but anomalous in others .",
    "this is almost trivial to envision in terms of the quantities already introduced above . for instance , consider a model with a waiting time distribution with a power law tail of the form @xmath0 .",
    "it may then happen that in some regimes of the model the waiting time distribution decays slowly ( @xmath1 ) , so that the average waiting time between transitions diverges . in a different regime of the model",
    "the decay of the waiting time may be sufficiently rapid ( @xmath2 ) for there to be a finite mean transition time .",
    "the process would be subdiffusive in the first regime and normal in the second .",
    "on the other hand , for example if a model has a jumping pattern with an infinite average jump distance in some regime but a finite one in another , the model would exhibit superdiffusive behavior in the first and normal diffusive behavior in the second .",
    "transitions between normal and anomalous behavior within a model can occur in many other ways as well .",
    "the literature is far too large to reference it properly .",
    "perhaps the earliest of these in the random walk context was introduced by zumofen and klafter  @xcite to describe the dynamics generated by iterated maps . a more recent example directly related to the discussion in our paper deals with a class of random walk models called ",
    "elephant random walks , \" a term coined by its creators  @xcite because they involve a sort of perfect memory often ( and most likely inappropriately ) associated with elephants . in these models , which have also been mentioned in applications as diverse as ecology , economic data , and dna strings , the memory induces a transition between normal and superdiffusive behavior observed with a change in parameter values  @xcite .",
    "while there is thus a plenitude of stochastic models in which the mean square displacement changes from one behavior to another as a parameter of the model is varied , it is more difficult to find models that exhibit all three forms of behavior , that is , ones in which a change of parameters leads to asymptotic subdiffusive , normal , and superdiffusive behavior . such versatility can be found in generalized langevin equations  @xcite and in dynamics governed by fractional brownian motion or fractional langevin equations ( a helpful list of references to the fractional langevin literature can be found in  @xcite ) . however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no single _ random walk _",
    "model that exhibits all three forms of behavior . in this paper",
    "we present such a model .",
    "it is a random walk model with a memory , and a simple sweep in parameter values indicating the direction of motion of the next change can lead to transitions covering all three forms of behavior .",
    "the model is inspired by the  elephant random walk \" introduced in  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present the random walk model . in sec .",
    "[ moments ] we calculate the moments of interest to characterize the nature of the motion of the random walker .",
    "a detailed analysis of the results is presented in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] . we conclude with a brief recap in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "following the notation in  @xcite , consider a random walker on a one - dimensional infinite lattice with unit distance between adjacent lattice sites .",
    "steps occur at discrete time intervals . at each step",
    "the walker can take one of three actions : it can move to the nearest neighbor site to its right , to the site on its left , or it can remain at its present location ( that is , the walk is intermittent ) .",
    "we denote the position of the walker at time step @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "the position of the walker at time step @xmath5 is @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a random number which can take on one of the values @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the choice of this random number at each step depends on the entire history of the walk , @xmath11 , as follows .",
    "a random previous time @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath3 is chosen with uniform probability .",
    "if @xmath14 , with probability @xmath15 the walker takes the same step at time @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath16 . with probability @xmath17 , the walker takes the opposite action , @xmath18 .",
    "the walker can stay at rest with probability @xmath19 , and of course @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 , the walker stays at rest with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the process is started at time @xmath22 by allowing the walker to move to the right with probability @xmath23 and to the left with probability @xmath24 , i.e. , the first step excludes the possibility that the walker may not move .",
    "if the walker is initially at @xmath25 , then the position of the walker at time @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 we make a special point here about the significance of the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath17 : they are * not * the familiar parameters that indicate a next - step asymmetry . rather , they are memory parameters that indicate whether the walker , if it moves at all at the next step , is likely to follow the randomly chosen past step ( persistence probability @xmath15 ) or is , instead , a rebellious walker who does the opposite ( probability @xmath17 ) .",
    "it is thus not straightforward to a priori predict the direction and growth properties of the walk as a function of these parameters . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the model reduces to that of  @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the inclusion of a probability that the walker neither follows nor rebels against the randomly chosen prior step , @xmath29 , turns out to be the crucial generalization that leads to the all - encompassing model .",
    "the quantities of interest to characterize the nature of the motion of the walker are the mean displacement and the mean square displacement as a function of time , both of which we are able to calculate analytically .",
    "the parameters of the problem are two of the stepping probability parameters ; those that turn out to be most useful in characterizing the properties of the walk are the  staying probability , \" @xmath19 , and the memory asymmetry parameter , @xmath30    we start by noting that for a given history @xmath31 , the conditional probability that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , can be written as , @xmath34= 1-\\sigma^2\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2t}\\sum_{k=1}^{t}\\left[\\sigma_k^2\\left(3\\sigma^2 - 2\\right ) \\left(1-r\\right)+\\sigma\\sigma_k\\gamma\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath35 , @xmath36=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+(2s-1)\\sigma\\right).\\ ] ] using eq .",
    "( [ er_1 ] ) , the conditional mean values of @xmath7 for @xmath26 in a given realization is given as @xmath37=\\frac{\\gamma}{t}x_t,\\ ] ] which , on averaging over all the histories , gives the following mean values , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean displacement of the walker .",
    "performing the average of eq .",
    "( [ n_0 ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ er_3 ] ) leads to the recursive equation @xmath40 whose solution is  @xcite @xmath41 the mean position of the walker vanishes if @xmath42 . for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the mean",
    "position is positive and negative respectively .",
    "thus , the first step , and the first step alone , determines whether the walker moves to the right or left macroscopically .",
    "the further evolution of the mean displacement does depend on the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "we note that for a symmetric memory , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , the mean position is time independent . for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , the mean position increases with time with an exponent which is smaller than unity for nonzero values of the rebellion parameter @xmath17 , and so the velocity of the walker decreases with time . for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , the mean position decreases monotonically with time at long times and thus , on average , the walker returns to the origin and thus remains localized in space .",
    "this type of motion might be useful to model the dynamics of animal home range behavior  @xcite .",
    "we next compute the second moment of the displacement , @xmath52 .",
    "for this , using eq .",
    "( [ n_0 ] ) , we note that @xmath53 for a given history @xmath31 , the conditional average of @xmath54 is then @xmath55 here we have made use of the fact that for a given history @xmath31 , @xmath4 is known , which allows us to write @xmath56 . using eq .",
    "( [ er_1 ] ) , the conditional mean values for @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 using eqs .",
    "( [ er_3 ] ) and ( [ n_s2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ n_c ] ) and averaging over all histories , we arrive at the recursive relation @xmath59 for @xmath28 , @xmath60 is always @xmath13 and so the term @xmath61 is simply @xmath3 .",
    "for @xmath62 the sum is unity because only the first step contributes .",
    "however , for nonzero values of @xmath19 , @xmath60 can be either @xmath13 or @xmath9 .    in order to compute @xmath63 , using eq .",
    "( [ n_s2 ] ) we write @xmath64 which on averaging over all histories gives the recursive relation @xmath65 leading to the solution @xmath66 using eq .",
    "( [ n_l ] ) in ( [ n_s2 ] ) gives @xmath67 substitution into eq .",
    "( [ er_6 ] ) and solution of the recursion equation leads to the mean square displacement for @xmath68 @xmath69 note that the dominance of the first or second terms is separated by the line @xmath70 . for @xmath46",
    ", we find @xmath71 equations ( [ er_5 ] ) , ( [ er_11 ] ) and ( [ er_12 ] ) are the central results of this section .",
    "for @xmath28 , these equations reduce to those obtained in  @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to analyze the various regimes of behavior of the variance @xmath72 embodied in these results when @xmath73 . a phase diagram associated with this discussion",
    "is shown in fig  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "of the random walker .",
    "the leftmost triangle , labeled as sub@xmath74 ( light blue in color ) , indicates one regime of subdiffusive behavior .",
    "the next triangular wedge , sub@xmath75 ( yellow in color ) is also a regime of subdiffusive behavior because here @xmath76 so the time exponent is less than unity . the two are separated by the line @xmath70 ( @xmath77 ) . the last triangular wedge , sup@xmath75 ( light green in color ) is a superdiffusive regime because here @xmath78 .",
    "the solid line connecting the subdiffusive and superdiffusive regions ( red in color ) , as well as the @xmath28 line for @xmath79 ( also red in color ) , indicate the regimes of normal diffusive behavior because here the variance grows as @xmath80 .",
    "the inclined solid and dashed thick lines indicate the variation of the behavior of the variance for fixed values of the persistence parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed ( blue in color ) line is for @xmath81 and , as @xmath17 and @xmath19 vary for this fixed value of @xmath15 , the walker s behavior remains subdiffusive throughout , although the form of the exponent changes .",
    "the solid ( also blue in color ) line is for @xmath82 .",
    "now as @xmath17 and @xmath19 vary , the walker s behavior covers all three regimes of behavior : subdiffusive ( of two sorts ) , diffusive , and superdiffusive.,width=302 ]",
    "the most interesting result of this calculation is , of course , the occurrence of all regimes of behavior , subdiffusive , diffusive , and superdiffusive . however , there are additional points to be emphasized because they are not necessarily intuitively obvious .    \\1 . for @xmath46 or @xmath47 ( unbiased memory ) ,",
    "the mean square displacement increases sublinearly with time since the exponent @xmath83 is always less than unity for nonzero @xmath19 values . in this case , the mean displacement is independent of time , and so the variance increases sublinearly .",
    "the behavior is therefore subdiffusive except at @xmath28 , where it is diffusive .",
    "this is an interesting , perhaps even counterintuitive result , which says that even the smallest probability of remaining at a given site at each step , with no other ostensible asymmetry toward the site first stepped on , leads to subdiffusive behavior .    \\2 .",
    "for any fixed @xmath84 we noted earlier that the mean position , which is necessarily one site away from the origin at the first step , decreases with time .",
    "the mean square displacement increases sublinearly with time as @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "the variance of a rebellious walker who has even the smallest probability of staying at a site at each step is thus simply subdiffusive .",
    "\\3 . for fixed @xmath48",
    "the behavior is more varied .",
    "for @xmath87 the mean square displacement grows sublinearly with time , as does the square of the mean displacement ( if it is not zero to begin with ) .",
    "the resulting variance thus grows subdiffusively for all values of the parameters subject to this condition , even though the walker more often than not follows its previous randomly chosen step . however , there are two distinct forms of subdiffusive growth , separated by the line @xmath70 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "these two distinct forms correspond to the dominance of the first or second terms in eq .",
    "( [ er_11 ] ) . in one ,",
    "subdiffusion is again caused by the possibility at each step that the walker may not move . in the other ,",
    "the walker s rebellion pulls it back .",
    "\\4 . for @xmath88 and @xmath29 the growth of the mean square displacement is dominated by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ er_11 ] ) , @xmath89 . for @xmath79 and @xmath28",
    "it is dominated by the second term , and again grows as @xmath89 .",
    "together with the contribution of the mean displacement , if present , this leads to a variance that grows linearly with time , that is , the motion is diffusive .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath90    \\5 .",
    "the point @xmath88 , @xmath28 ( where the two red lines meet in color ) the motion is marginally superdiffusive , that is , the variance grows as @xmath91 .",
    "\\6 . when @xmath92 the behavior is superdiffusive .",
    "both the mean displacement ( if @xmath93 ) and the mean square displacement contribute to this behavior of the variance .",
    "the analysis is considerably more interesting if instead of following constant @xmath45 lines , as we have done above , we follow the behavior at constant @xmath19 , allowing @xmath15 and @xmath17 to vary . for small @xmath19",
    "the figure shows that we cover all regimes of behavior as @xmath15 increases relative to @xmath17 ( @xmath45 increased ) , namely , the two forms of subdiffusive behavior , diffusive behavior , and superdiffusive behavior .",
    "however , if @xmath19 exceeds the value @xmath94 , then we observe only subdiffusive behavior - the tendency not to move is too strong to allow anything else .",
    "the analysis is also very interesting if instead we follow the behavior at a given value of @xmath15 , letting @xmath17 and @xmath19 vary .",
    "this is shown by the two inclined lines in the figure .",
    "the dashed line is for @xmath81 and the behavior remains subdiffusive throughout .",
    "the persistence is too low to allow for superdiffusive or even diffusive behavior . on the other hand",
    "if the persistence parameter is sufficiently large , as in the solid inclined line ( @xmath82 ) , we sweep all of the behaviors as @xmath17 and @xmath19 are varied subject to this constraint .",
    "the value that separates the two regimes is @xmath95 .",
    "we have thus presented a random walk model with memory that exhibits all three forms of asymptotic behavior as the parameters of the model are varied .",
    "the characterization has been analytical , in terms of the first and second moments of the motion .",
    "the model , which is inspired by one introduced earlier  @xcite , has only three simple parameters .",
    "one is a parameter that characterizes the very first step of the walk ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "a second is the probability that the next step of the walk copies the direction of a randomly chosen earlier step ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the third is the probability that the next step performs the opposite motion as that of the randomly chosen earlier step ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a fourth , which is actually the crucial new parameter of the model , is the probability @xmath19 that the walker simply does not move at the next step .",
    "it is constrained by the others via the conservation condition @xmath20 .",
    "the model can be extended in a number of directions .",
    "for instance , one can explore changes in the nature of the memory .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate quantities other than the first two moments , perhaps even the full distribution and statistics of extrema .",
    "perhaps more interesting would be an adjustment of the model so that it can provide insights into real behaviors that exhibit these different regimes .",
