    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe and are leading candidates for the origin of ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) .",
    "prompt emission from grbs from @xmath1110  kev to @xmath111 to 5  mev has usually been detected but , occasionally photons above 100  mev have been detected by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret)@xcite , and more recently by astro - rivelatore gamma a immagini leggero ( agile)@xcite . observations of gamma rays with energies",
    "@xmath12  mev are particularly prescriptive because they constrain the source environment and help understand the underlying energy source .",
    "although there have been observations of photons above 100  mev@xcite , it has not been possible to distinguish competing interpretations of the emission@xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , launched on 11 june 2008 , provides broad energy coverage and high grb sensitivities through the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) and the large area telescope ( lat)@xcite . the gbm consists of 12 sodium iodide ( nai ) detectors which cover the energy band between 8  kev and 1  mev , and two bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillators which are for the energy band between 150 kev and 40  mev .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion telescope with the energy coverage from 20  mev to more than 300  gev . in this paper , we report detailed measurements of gamma - ray emission from the grb 080916c detected by the gbm and lat .",
    "at 00:12:45.613542 ut ( @xmath13 ) on september 16 2008 the gbm flight software triggered on grb 080916c .",
    "the grb produced large signals in 9 of the 12 nai detectors and in one of the two bgo detectors .",
    "analysis of the data on the ground localized the burst to a right ascension ( ra ) = @xmath14 , declination ( dec ) = @xmath15@xcite , with an uncertainty of 2.8  at 68% confidence level ( c.l . ) . at the time of the trigger ,",
    "the grb was located @xmath1148  from the lat boresight and on - ground analysis revealed a bright source consistent with the grb location . using the events collected during the first 66 s after @xmath13 , within 20  around the gbm burst position , the lat provided a localization of ra = @xmath16 , dec .",

    "the lightcurve of grb 080916c , as observed with _",
    "gbm and lat , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbm - lat - lc ] . the total number of lat counts after background subtraction in the first 100  s after the trigger was @xmath25 . for most of the low - energy events ,",
    "however , extracting reliable directional and energy information was not possible .",
    "after we applied standard selection cuts@xcite for transient sources with energies greater than 100  mev and directions compatible with the burst location , 145 events remained ( panel 4 ) , and 14 events had energies @xmath26  gev .    because of the energy - dependent temporal structure of the lightcurve , we divided the lightcurve into five time intervals ( a , b , c , d , e ) delineated by the vertical lines ( fig .  [ fig : gbm - lat - lc ] ) .",
    "the grb lightcurve at low energy has two bright peaks , one between 0 and 3.6  s after the trigger ( interval ` a ' ) , and one between 3.6 and 7.7  s ( interval ` b ' ) .",
    "the two peaks are distinct in the bgo lightcurve , but less so in the nai . in the lat detector",
    "the first peak is not significant though the lightcurve shows evidence of activity in time interval ( a ) , mostly in events below 100 mev . above 100 mev , peak ( b )",
    "is prominent in the lat lightcurve .",
    "interval ( c ) coincides with the tail of the main pulse , and the last two intervals reflect temporal structure in the nai lightcurve and have been chosen to provide enough statistics in the lat energy band for spectral analysis .",
    "the highest energy photon was observed during interval ( d ) : @xmath27  gev .",
    "most of the emission in peak ( b ) shifts toward later times as the energy increases ( inset ) .",
    "we performed simultaneous spectral fits of the gbm and lat data for each of the five time bins described above and shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : gbm - lat - lc ] .",
    "gbm nai data from detectors 3 and 4 were selected from 8  kev to 1.0  mev , as well as bgo detector 0 data from 0.26 to 40  mev .",
    "lat photons were selected using the  transient \" event class@xcite for the energies from 100 mev to 200 gev .",
    "this event class provides the largest effective area and highest background rates among the lat standard event classes , which is appropriate for transient sources with small background integration time .",

    "the histograms show the number of counts obtained by folding the photon model through the instrument response models .",
    "the black histogram shows the count models obtained by folding the best - fit band photon function through the detector responses .",
    "a fit which is a combination of the band function and a high - energy power law is shown with the cyan histogram .",
    "the residuals are calculated for the simple band function fit in the bottom panel . ]",
    "the spectra of all five time intervals are well fit by the empirical band function@xcite which smoothly joins low- and high - energy power laws .",
    "[ fig : fit - param ] shows time evolutions of fit parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath28 and .",
    "the first time interval , with a relative paucity of photons in the lat , also has the most distinct spectral parameter values .",
    "the low - energy photon index @xmath31 is larger ( indicating harder emission ) and the high - energy photon index @xmath28 is smaller ( indicating softer emission ) - consistent with the small number of lat photons observed at this time . after the first interval",
    "there was no significant evolution in either @xmath31 or @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast , , the energy at which the energy emission peaks in the sense of energy per photon energy decade , evolved from the first time bin to reach its highest value in the second time bin , then softened through the remainder of the grb . the higher  and overall intensity of interval ( b ) , combined with the hard value of @xmath28 that is characteristic of the later intervals , are the spectral characteristics that lead to the emission peaking in the lat lightcurve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gbm - lat - lc ] ) .",
    "we searched for deviations from the band function , such as an additional component at high energies@xcite .",
    "three photons in the fourth time bin had energies above 6  gev .",
    "we tried modeling these high - energy photons with a power law as an additional high - energy spectral component .",
    "compared to the null hypothesis that the data originated from a simple band grb function , adding the additional power - law component resulted in a probability of 1% that there was no additional spectral component for this time bin ; with five time bins , this is not strong evidence for any additional component .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the spectrum of this interval with two fit models , a band function and a combination of the band function and an additional high - energy power law component .",
    "our sensitivity to higher - energy photons may be reduced at @xmath32 through absorption by extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "because the effect of various ebl models ranges widely@xcite , we do not use ebl absorption effects in our estimation of significance , which gives conservative estimates .",
    "although the lightcurves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbm - lat - lc ] indicate that during interval ( e ) the spiky structures typical of prompt grb emission appear to be dying out , the emission persisted in some of the gbm nai detectors at a low level out to nearly @xmath33  s. since the excess above background in the 12 nai detectors occurred in the ratios expected for the geometry of the detectors relative to the burst direction and this type of low - level , extended emission is a known phenomenon in at least some long grbs@xcite , we associate it with the grb and fit the spectrum with a power - law index of @xmath34 .",
    "emission beyond @xmath33  s fell below the threshold of the gbm detectors .",
    "long lived emission in the lat band was searched for by a unbinned maximum likelihood fit of a power - law spectral function for a point source at the grond - determined burst location using the event class with minimum backgrounds ( `` diffuse '' ) .",
    "the fits are performed for two time intervals @xmath35@xmath36  s and @xmath33@xmath37  s for events within 15  of the grond localization coordinates .",
    "the upper bound was chosen because after @xmath38  s , the grb off - axis angle increased from 50  to 62  resulting in decreased effective area .",
    "contributions from instrumental , galactic , extragalactic components were included in the fit , as well as the bright source vela ( which is located 13  from the grb ) .",
    "fits in both time intervals show the presence of significant flux . for the final time interval , @xmath33 to @xmath38  s ,",
    "the fit yields a flux of @xmath39 @xmath40 for @xmath41  mev with a power - law photon index of @xmath42 at a significance of 5.6@xmath43 .",
    "if the position of the point source is left free instead of fixed to the grond localization , the fit yields a source position of ra = @xmath44 , dec .",
    "= @xmath45 with an uncertainty of 0.51  at 90% c.l .",
    "this location is 0.45  from , and in agreement with , the grond grb position . to solidify the association of this extended emission with the grb",
    ", we performed the same source detection procedure for data from @xmath46  s to @xmath13 and no emission was observed . a search for emission beyond @xmath38  s was also fruitless .",
    "we therefore associate this long - lived component with the grb and include it as a sixth and seventh time interval for comparison with the early - time emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : extended ] ) . in the lat data , a constantly declining high - energy flux with a power - law decay index of @xmath47 is seen throughout @xmath38  s ( red points , fig .",
    "[ fig : extended ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the flux in the gbm band shows a slower decay initially and an apparent break in the lightcurve at @xmath48  s. the power - law decay indices are approximately @xmath49 and @xmath50 before and after the break , respectively .",
    "kev ( shown in blue open squares ) and above 100  mev ( red filled squares ) , and power - law index as a function of the time from @xmath13 to @xmath38  s ( bottom panel , lat data only ) .",
    "red points are obtained by spectral fits of the lat - only data for all time intervals .",
    "blue points are obtained with the band functions listed in table 1 for the first 5 intervals and a power - law fit with index @xmath51 for the 6th interval . ]",
    "the _ fermi _ observations of grb 080916c show that the event energy spectra up to @xmath52s are consistent with a single model ( band function ) , suggesting that a single emission mechanism dominates .",
    "a non - thermal synchrotron emission is the favored emission mechanism at kev to mev energies@xcite , and can indeed reach @xmath53\\;$]gev@xcite .",
    "however , it should be accompanied by a synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) spectral component produced from electrons that compton upscatter their synchrotron photons to @xmath6-ray energies potentially in the lat energy band .",
    "the apparent absence of an ssc component indicates that the magnetic energy density is much higher than the electron energy density or that the ssc @xmath54 spectrum peaks at @xmath55gev and thus can not be detected .",
    "it should be noted that sensitivity to a high - energy additional spectral component is reduced because ebl can absorb high - energy photons via pair - production interactions although the effect of the ebl can not be estimated reliably due to large model dependence .",
    "the delayed onset of the grb 080916c lat pulse , which coincides with the rise of the second peak in the gbm light curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gbm - lat - lc ] ) indicates that the two peaks may originate in spatially distinct regions .",
    "a @xmath56 pair - production opacity effect may be ruled out since we do not observe any spectral cutoff in the combined gbm / lat data .",
    "it is intriguing that long lived gamma - ray emission in the lat band exhibits different temporal behaviors from those in the gbm band .",
    "in particular , our measurement indicates a temporal break in the gbm band in contrary to the continuous decay in the lat band . before our observations , a high - energy ( 100 mev ",
    "gev ) tail was observed most clearly from grb 940217@xcite in observations by egret , which was not conclusive .",
    "the lat high - energy tail may indicate cascades induced by ultrarelativistic ions accelerated in grbs@xcite , or angle - dependent scattering effects@xcite .    a measurement of redshift @xmath57 by grond@xcite combined with _",
    "measurements provides several kinematic constraints on this grb .",
    "between 10  kev and 10  gev in the observer s frame , we measure a fluence @xmath58 ergs @xmath59 which gives at @xmath57 an apparent isotropic energy release for a standard cold dark matter cosmology with cosmological constant @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and a hubble s constant of 71 km s@xmath62 mpc@xmath62 of @xmath63 ergs . this is @xmath64 times the solar rest energy , and therefore strongly suggests on energetic grounds , for any stellar mass progenitor , that the grb outflow powering this emission occupied only a small fraction ( @xmath65 ) of the total solid angle , and was collimated into a narrow jet .    given the intensity of observed photons , large bulk lorentz factor @xmath66 is required to avoid the attenuation of high - energy photons in a compact emission region expected from rapid variability @xcite .",
    "using the band function as the target radiation field and setting to unity the optical depth @xmath67 to @xmath6-ray pair production attenuation of the highest - energy observed photon , we obtain @xmath68 and @xmath69 in time bins d and b , respectively , for @xmath57 .",
    "our limits are much higher than previous firm estimates of @xmath70 from grb 990123@xcite .",
    "the high - energy photons and a large redshift can also provides an limit on the violation of lorentz invariance expected from some quantum gravity models@xcite . in the linear approximation ,",
    "the difference in the arrival times @xmath71 is proportional to the ratio of photon energy difference to the quantum gravity mass , @xmath72 , and depends on the distance the photons traveled .",
    "the arrival time of the 13.2-gev photon relative to @xmath13 , @xmath73  s , is a conservative upper limit on its @xmath71 relative to @xmath74 photons , and implies a robust lower limit on the quantum gravity mass , @xmath75  gev@xmath10 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the previous limit obtained in this fashion@xcite .",
    "this lower limit is only one order of magnitude smaller than the planck mass , @xmath76  gev/@xmath77 .",
