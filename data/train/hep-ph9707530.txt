    "in this talk , i cover the following four subjects .    1 .   quark model description of the baryon - baryon interaction including hyperons@xcite .",
    "2 .   antisymmetric spin - orbit force from the 3  flavor symmetry point of view@xcite 3 .",
    "description of weak @xmath0 interaction in the direct quark mechanism@xcite .",
    "4 .   magnetic moments of light hypernuclei and contributions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 exchange currents@xcite .    in this report",
    ", i discuss the first two subjects in detail and leave the others to references given above .",
    "recent experimental activities in hypernuclear physics provide us with high quality data of production , spectra and decays of hypernuclei .",
    "the accumulation of such data accelerates quantitative analyses of the strong and weak interactions of hyperons .",
    "theoretical efforts have been devoted to understanding hypernuclear structure and production and decay mechanisms . there",
    "the most important ingredient is the hyperon - nucleon interactions .",
    "several realistic potential models are in use widely@xcite , but their foundations are not solid and furthermore , there are some discrepancies among the models . for instance , the strengths of the spin - spin interaction vary significantly among the models .",
    "it seems urgent to establish the quantitative description of the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) interactions .    in studying the yn interactions ,",
    "it is natural to follow the description of nuclear force .",
    "the long - range part of the nuclear force is explained very well in terms of one - pion exchange mechanism , while heavy mesons as well as multi - pion exchanges are necessary for the medium range part of the nuclear force .",
    "one - boson exchange potential models , in which two- ( and multi- ) pion exchanges are taken into account as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 exchanges , are fairly successful in accounting the large amount of data for nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "yet the short - range part of the nuclear force is not fully treated , that is , repulsive cores ( hard or soft ) are introduced phenomenologically to explain the nn scattering phase shifts around @xmath5 mev in the center of mass system .",
    "indeed , this is the region where the internal quark - gluon structure of the nucleon must be considered explicitly .",
    "it was pointed out that the quark exchange force between two nucleons give significant repulsion at the short distance .",
    "the exchange force is induced by the quark antisymmetrization and therefore is nonlocal and of short - range determined by the size of the quark content of the nucleon .",
    "the most important feature of the quark exchange force is its dependence on the spin - flavor symmetry of two - baryon states .",
    "a close analogy is found in the hydrogen molecule , where two electrons orbit around two protons .",
    "as the total spin of the electrons specifies the symmetry of the spin wave function , the sign of the exchange force is determined according to the spin .",
    "the symmetric orbital state is allowed only for @xmath6 , while the exchange force is strongly repulsive for @xmath7 .",
    "similar state dependencies appear in the quark exchange force , where the spin - flavor 6  symmetry determines the properties of the exchange interactions .",
    "we applied the quark cluster model description of the short - range yn interactions@xcite .",
    "we found that the flavor singlet combination of @xmath8 has no repulsion induced by the quark exchange at the short distance .",
    "as this state is known to be favored by the magnetic part of the one - gluon exchange interaction ( color - magnetic interaction ) , a bound or a resonance state called h dibaryon may exist@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "most other channels have strong repulsion at short distances .    another interesting observation made in ref.@xcite",
    "is that the @xmath9 wave @xmath10 interaction depends strongly on the total spin and isospin .",
    "the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath6 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath12 , @xmath7 ) states belong mainly to the [ 51 ] irreducible representation of the spin - flavor 6  symmetry .",
    "this is the representation in which a pauli forbidden state appears in the @xmath13 orbital motion .",
    "the pauli principle forbids two baryons to get together and thus gives a strong repulsion .",
    "the other spin - isospin states do not belong to this symmetry and therefore the short range repulsion is weaker .",
    "this qualitative argument was confirmed in realistic quark cluster model calculation of the yn interactions@xcite .",
    "recent analyses by niigata - kyoto group show that the strong repulsion remains after combining the quark exchange interaction with the long - range meson exchange attraction@xcite .",
    "no experimental evidence is yet available to be able to confirm the strong state dependencies .",
    "more @xmath14 scattering data are anticipated very much .",
    "one of the interesting features of the hyperon - nucleon interactions is the properties of the spin - orbit force .",
    "the galilei invariant spin - orbit force consists of symmetric ls ( sls ) and antisymmetric ls ( als ) terms , @xmath15 because the als operator @xmath16 is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two baryons , @xmath17 should be zero between like baryons . in the nuclear force ,",
    "als between proton and neutron breaks the isospin symmetry and is classified as a type iv charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) force .",
    "evidence of such a csb force was given by measuring the difference between the proton and neutron analyzing powers in the @xmath18 scattering experiments@xcite .",
    "the results show that this force is very weak , supporting the isospin invariance of the nuclear force .    on the contrary , the als forces in the hyperon - nucleon interactions do not vanish even in the su(3 ) flavor symmetric limit . for hyperon - nucleon systems ,",
    "als seems as strong as the symmetric ls part .",
    "if the magnitudes of sls and als are comparable , then the single particle ls force for one of the baryons , ( ex .",
    "@xmath19 ) inside ( hyper)nuclei is much smaller than that for the other baryon ( nucleon ) . since recent",
    "experiment suggests that the single particle ls force for @xmath19 might be sizable contrary to the wide belief of vanishing ls force for @xmath19 , it is extremely important to pin down the magnitude of the two - body ls force .",
    "here we study the properties of the yn als forces from the su(3 ) symmetry point of view .",
    "# 1*#1 *    for the octet baryons , the baryon - baryon interactions can be classified in terms of the su(3 ) irreducible representations given by @xmath20 among these six irreducible representations , first three , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , are symmetric under the exchange of two baryons and the other three @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , are antisymmetric@xcite . noting that two - baryon states are to be antisymmetric , and that the color wave function for the color - singlet baryons is always symmetric , we find that the symmetric ( antisymmetric ) flavor representations are combined only to antisymmetric ( symmetric ) spin - orbital states .    in baryon - baryon scattering ,",
    "the als force induces the transition ( mixing ) between the spin singlet states ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ,  ) and the spin triplet states with the same @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ,  ) .",
    "the flavor symmetries of @xmath27 state must be antisymmetric , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while that of @xmath32 state is symmetric , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 .    if one assumes the 3  invariance of the strong interaction , different irreducible representations are not mixed .",
    "therefore the only possible combination of symmetric and antisymmetric representations is @xmath35 .",
    "we conclude that the als in the su(3 ) limit should only connect @xmath22 and @xmath26 .",
    "the symmetry structure becomes clearer by decomposing the @xmath36wave @xmath37 ( @xmath11 ) , as a concrete example , into the 3  irreducible representations .",
    "the flavor symmetric states read @xmath38 while the antisymmetric ones are @xmath39 in the 3  limit , the only surviving matrix element is @xmath40 .",
    "when we turn to the yn particle basis , we obtain the following relations in the 3  limit .",
    "@xmath41    on the contrary , the @xmath14 ( @xmath12 ) system belongs purely to the 3  @xmath23 and therefore the als matrix element vanishes in the 3  limit .",
    "@xmath42    these relations come only from the 3  symmetry and is general for any als interactions regardless their origin .",
    "it is extremely interesting to note that ( 1 ) the als for @xmath43 is much stronger than and has different sign from that for @xmath44 , ( 2 ) the coupling of @xmath45 is also strong , and ( 3 ) the als for @xmath14 depends strongly on the isospin or the charge states .",
    "the quark substructure of the baryon must play significant roles at short distances in the baryonic interactions@xcite .",
    "the quark model symmetry is especially simple when two baryons sit on top of each other . for @xmath46 states , the six - quark orbital state takes [ 51 ] symmetry , which can couple only to the [ 42 ] 6  representation due to the pauli principle .",
    "namely the [ 6 ] symmetric 6  states are not allowed to couple to [ 51 ] orbital configuration .",
    "the @xmath11 @xmath47 states at @xmath48 are given in the su(6)/su(3 ) symmetry basis by @xmath49 \\rep{8_a}\\rangle +   |[42 ] \\rep{10^*}\\rangle \\\\",
    "|s=1\\rangle & = & |[42 ] \\rep{8_s}\\rangle +   |[42 ] \\rep{27}\\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again the als in the 3  limit can connect only the octet states , @xmath50 \\rep{8_a}$ ] and @xmath50 \\rep{8_s}$ ] , and the ratio of the als interaction in the particle basis , @xmath47 should follow eq.(3 ) .",
    "the quark - quark potential due to one - gluon exchange gives a @xmath51 spin - orbit interaction .",
    "its contribution to the yn als forces are calculated in the above mentioned limit ( @xmath52 ) @xcite .",
    "they are compared with the corresponding potential of the ordinary spin orbit force between the @xmath32 states in table [ tab : qcm ] .",
    "the results show that the als forces due to the quark exchange force are as strong as the ordinary ls force of the same origin .",
    "especially , the @xmath14 ( @xmath11 ) feels a stronger als force between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , than the ordinary ls force between @xmath7 states .",
    "this is a very interesting result .",
    "the quark exchange als force might play dominant role in the yn forces , as was already suggested and demonstrated by kyoto - niigata group@xcite .",
    ".als and ls matrix elements at @xmath52 normalized by the overlapping matrix element .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     one sees that except for the @xmath53 matrix element , the sum of the @xmath4 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 contributions vanishes as expected from the 3  symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the difference between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 als matrix elements come from the isovector @xmath4 exchange and also that the difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 is caused by the sign change of @xmath55 exchange . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath55 exchanges are added up while they tend to cancel for @xmath61 .",
    "when the 3  symmetry breaking is taken into account , the coefficients in table [ tab : obe ] for @xmath4 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can not simply be summed up , as the interaction range for @xmath55 is significantly shorter than that for @xmath4 or @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore the differences among the octet baryon masses generate various terms that would vanish in the 3  limit . the full form of the als potential for the scalar , pseudoscalar and vector exchanges",
    "are given in the following .",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the scattering of @xmath65 is considered , while @xmath66 is the mass of the proton . the terms that contains the spin exchange operator , @xmath67 come from the exchange part in the @xmath2 and @xmath55 exchanges .    fig .",
    "1 shows the als part of the one - boson exchange potential ( obe ) and the adiabatic potential in the quark cluster model ( qcm ) for the @xmath12 @xmath14 channel , , @xmath68 .",
    "it can be compared with the corresponding ordinary ls ( sls ) part for @xmath69 , shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the curves in these figures show various cases in 3  breaking .",
    "the potentials in the 3  symmetric limit are labeled by `` bs - ms '' for obe and `` qcm - s '' for qcm .",
    "the als potentials are zero in this limit .",
    "the symmetry is broken in `` qcm - d '' by the quark mass difference , while in `` bd - md '' both the meson mass differences and the baryon mass differences are taken into account .",
    "it is clear that the als is strongly suppressed even when the 3  symmetry breaking is considered . 3  breaking effect is small also in sls . in general , we observe that the als potential is very weak for the two - baryon channels in which the als vanishes in the 3  limit . in these figures ,",
    "potential parameters are chosen from the nijmegen model d potential in obe and ref.@xcite for qcm .",
    "3 and 4 shows the obe and qcm adiabatic potentials in the @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and @xmath71 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "they show that the als potentials are rather strong .",
    "it is also indicated that the qcm gives stronger als than obe and also that the effects of 3  breaking is less for qcm .",
    "we have studied the 3  symmetry of the als interactions in the yn force , and found that the 3  symmetry is rather good in accounting the properties of als forces in various baryon channels .",
    "the yn als forces due to the quark exchange are significantly large , comparable to the ordinary ls force of the same origin .",
    "the meson exchange force almost vanishes except for a term proportional to the difference in @xmath72 ratios of the vector and tensor couplings of the vector mesons .",
    "thus the als interaction has a shorter range than the ordinary ls force , or the tensor forces .",
    "it is extremely interesting to pin down the strengths and the properties of the als forces in the yn sector in determining the origin of the baryonic forces .",
    "further theoretical and experimental studies of the yn spin - orbit interactions are very much encouraged .",
