    "the quantum mechanical concept of quantization is concerned with assigning quantum observables to classical variables ( and functions thereof ) .",

    "the aim of the present paper is to use the weyl quantization for the modeling of perturbations of hamiltonians for a class of open quantum systems and the robust stability analysis based on this description of uncertainty",
    ".    a wide range of open quantum systems , which interact with their environment , can be modelled by using the apparatus of quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) @xcite . in this framework , which follows the heisenberg picture of quantum dynamics ,",
    "a quantum noise is introduced in order to represent the surroundings as a heat bath of external fields acting on a boson fock space @xcite . the qsde approach to open quantum systems",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with open quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by quantum stochastic differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are driven by quantum wiener processes which represent external boson fields . </S>",
    "<S> the system - field coupling operators are linear functions of the system variables . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian consists of a nominal quadratic function of the system variables and an uncertain perturbation which is represented in a weyl quantization form . assuming that the nominal linear quantum system is stable , we develop sufficient conditions on the perturbation of the hamiltonian which guarantee robust mean square stability of the perturbed system . </S>",
    "<S> examples are given to illustrate these results for a class of hamiltonian perturbations in the form of trigonometric polynomials of the system variables .    </S>",
