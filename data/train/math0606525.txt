    "boundary layers appear in various physical contexts , such as fluid mechanics , thermodynamics , or ferromagnetic media . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", they are related to singular perturbation problems in bounded domains .",
    "the singular perturbation is due to the presence of small parameters in the dimensionless governing equations .",
    "for instance , in magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , the so - called rossby number ( ratio between the angular velocity of the fluid and the angular velocity of the earth ) can be as low as @xmath0 . similarly , the prandtl number ( ratio between hydrodynamic and magnetic diffusivity ) is about @xmath1 in the earth s core . in the interior of the domain , these small parameters lead to some reduced dynamics of the equations .",
    "for instance , in highly rotating fluids , the velocity field does not vary along the rotation axis , see textbook @xcite .",
    "this reduced dynamics is often incompatible with boundary conditions . this yields boundary layers , in which the solutions of the equations have strong gradients , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions ( typically a dirichlet condition at a rigid surface ) .    in a formal",
    "setting , boundary layer problems are connected to systems of the type @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes the small parameters of the system , @xmath4 is the domain , @xmath5 the unknown , @xmath6 the data , @xmath7 is a linear differential operator ( most often of elliptic or parabolic type ) , and @xmath8 the nonlinear part",
    ". one must of course supply these equations with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the basic idea , which underlies the mathematical study of all boundary layers , is that the solution @xmath9 of should satisfy an asymptotics of the form @xmath10 this means that @xmath9 should have a regular part , depending on @xmath11 , but also a singular part , depending on stretched variables @xmath12 , with @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "this singular part should be localized near the boundary and express the strong gradients of boundary layers .",
    "broadly speaking , the aim of boundary layers studies is to answer the following questions :    i ) : :    what are the possible @xmath15 ( the    boundary layer sizes ) ?",
    "ii ) : :    what are the possible profiles @xmath16 , @xmath17    ?",
    "iii ) : :    is the asymptotics correct ( in a sense to be determined ) ?",
    "the first two questions are related to the derivation of boundary layers , whereas the third one is connected to stability issues .",
    "the aim of this note is to give some insight into the derivation problem . in some cases",
    ", the derivation is quite easy , and the stability analysis is the most difficult part ( see for instance @xcite on viscous perturbations of hyperbolic systems ) .",
    "but in most situations of physical interest , it may involve a variety of length scales and equations .",
    "a typical example is the description of water in a highly rotating tank .",
    "if the water is at rest in the rotating frame attached to the tank , it is well modeled by stokes equations with coriolis term : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rotation vector , and @xmath20 is a small parameter called the ekman number . for such system ( with appropriate source term @xmath21 and boundary conditions ) , the structure of the solutions near a flat horizontal boundary is understood : there is a boundary layer of size @xmath22 , the ekman layer ( see @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", one can even carry an analysis of the full navier - stokes equations with rotation : we refer to @xcite among others . but in more elaborate geometries , following the articles of stewartson @xcite , many other layers develop : for instance , between two concentric spheres with slightly different rotation speeds , boundary layers of size @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ,  are expected near the inner sphere and the cylinder circumscribing it ( see figure [ figure ] ) .",
    "[ figure ]    [ stewartson ]    note that equations are linear .",
    "generally , the derivation of the boundary layers does not involve the nonlinearity @xmath26 of : it only matters in stability questions .",
    "in short , one can say that the nonlinear term does not create the boundary layer , but may destabilize it .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to linear equations @xmath27    classically , the problem of the derivation is tackled through one of the following ways :    i ) : :    an explicit calculation , where the exact solution is computed and    expanded . however , such technique is restrictive ( an analytical    computation is rarely tractable ) and often tedious ( see for instance    @xcite , with bessel functions ) .",
    "ii ) : :    the so - called `` method of matched asymptotics '' , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a general presentation .",
    "the idea of this method is to patch    two asymptotic expansions : an `` outer '' regular one , far from the    boundary , and an `` inner '' singular one , close to it .",
    "such expansions    must coincide in an overlap domain , which provides boundary conditions    for both outer and inner profiles .",
    "the structure of the inner    expansion ( including the layer sizes ) is sought by trial , through the    principle of least degeneracy ( _ c.f .",
    "_ @xcite for a detailed    explanation ) .",
    "this method has been applied with success to various    physical systems , including singularities near edges .",
    "however , the    determination of layer sizes leads to heavy computations , and must    often be supplied with refined physical arguments ( see @xcite on    rotating fluids ) .",
    "a new method of derivation has been recently introduced in @xcite ( see also the proceedings @xcite ) .",
    "it is based on the asymptotic analysis of the symbol @xmath28 as @xmath29 goes to zero , for @xmath30 .",
    "briefly , up to use local coordinates near @xmath31 , one can consider that equation holds in a neighborhood of @xmath32 in @xmath33 .",
    "then , the leading idea of the derivation is to carry a fourier - laplace analysis : boundary layer sizes near @xmath11 are deduced from modal solutions @xmath34 of the equation with frozen coefficients @xmath35 in other words , one must consider the characteristic manifold of @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 . broadly speaking ,",
    "if @xmath39 is the dual variable of @xmath40 , boundary layers correspond to @xmath41 in @xmath42 that satisfy @xmath43 the size of the boundary layers is then given by @xmath44 .",
    "in most cases , boundary layer equations follow , by appropriate rescaling of the symbol .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite at a fully formal level .",
    "it has been applied with efficiency to various geophysical systems , including rotating fluids or mhd .",
    "it has allowed to recover the main boundary layers of the physical literature , with very few and simple algebraic computations ( see @xcite for all details ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to provide this formal method with some mathematical basis .",
    "we will limit ourselves to scalar equations . in this",
    "reduced ( but still large ! ) setting , we will show how the microlocal analysis of is linked to boundary layer expansions .",
    "we will present a set of conditions ( assumptions ( h1 ) to ( h5 ) ) that ensures the existence of such expansions , _ with clearly identified boundary layer sizes and equations_. hypothesis ( h1 ) to ( h5 ) involve symbols derived from @xmath45 .",
    "they will be shown to be _ intrinsic _ , although these symbols depend on the choice of local coordinates .",
    "let us specify the framework of the study .",
    "let @xmath46 be a smooth riemannian manifold , @xmath47 .",
    "in all situations of physical interest , @xmath46 will be of the type @xmath48 , @xmath49 , where the torus @xmath50 models periodic boundary conditions in @xmath51 physical variables .",
    "the riemannian metric will be the euclidean metric induced by @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 a domain of @xmath46 .",
    "we denote @xmath54 the boundary of @xmath53 , which is a @xmath55 dimensional submanifold of @xmath46 .",

    "we endow @xmath56 with the riemannian structure induced by @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that there exist a tubular neighborhood of @xmath56 in @xmath46 , @xmath59 , and a smooth diffeomorphism @xmath60 such that @xmath61 in @xmath62 , @xmath63 in @xmath64 .",
