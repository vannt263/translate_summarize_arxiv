    "current microlensing experiments ( macho , alcock et al . 1997 ; eros , aubourg et al . 1995 ; ogle , udalski et al . 1993 ; duo , alard 1996 ) have produced exquisite light curves of variable stars as byproducts .",
    "these thousands of light curves allow us to address advanced questions regarding stellar evolution , pulsational physics , the distance scale and galactic structure , which would in turn aid in the interpretation of microlensing .",
    "this paper reports on the macho pulsating variable stars , with emphasis on the semiregular variables in the bulge , which have not been previously analyzed .",
    "the lmc counterparts are discussed in this book by alves at al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and a list of references regarding other variable stars in the macho database can be found in our web page at * http://wwwmacho.mcmaster.ca/*. this paper is part of a systematic study of the structure of the inner milky way using different distance indicators contained in this database ( minniti et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .    a description of the macho system is given by cook et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "briefly , the 1.27 m telescope at mssso obtains nightly images of several bulge , lmc , or smc fields in two passbands simultaneously .",
    "these images are photometered on - line , and later calibrated to produce accurate @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnitudes .",
    "variable stars are also identified automatically , and their light curves are phased using a super - smoother algorithm ( cook et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the period - amplitude diagram of about 50000 periodic variables in the top 24 macho fields from the 1993 season is shown in figure 1 .",
    "these variables have periods @xmath3 days .",
    "stars with periods longer than 100 days ( e.g. miras ) have not been phased yet , although our light curves in the bulge contain typically 700 points over a 5-year baseline .",
    "the presence of rr lyrae type ab at @xmath4 day and semiregulars at @xmath0 days is evident .",
    "in addition , there is a large number of eclipsing binaries with @xmath5 , spanning a wide range of periods .",
    "the binaries with shorter periods overlap in the diagrams of figure 1 with the rr lyrae type c.    the nightly observations introduce aliasing when phasing the light curves of variable stars . these aliased periods with @xmath6 days ( with @xmath7 ) are seen in figure 1 . to eliminate aliases",
    ", we demand that the periods in both bands are the same to within a few percent , i.e. @xmath8% .",
    "clearly , the visual inspection of the light curves of 50000 bulge variables would be time consuming .",
    "fortunately , the automatic classification of variable stars can be very much improved having observations in two different passbands .",
    "the discrimination between eclipsing and pulsating variables in this database is most easily done using the amplitude ratios .",
    "most pulsating variable stars have @xmath9 , while the light curves of most eclipsing binaries have @xmath10 .",
    "figure 2 shows the same diagrams as figure 1 , but containing only pulsating variables , simply selected using @xmath8% and @xmath9 .",
    "these diagrams look much cleaner , showing the different families of pulsating stars .",
    "these are @xmath11 scuti stars , with @xmath12 days , rr lyrae stars type c , with @xmath13 days , rr lyrae type ab , with @xmath14 days , and semiregular variables , with @xmath0 days .",
    "the bulge rr lyrae in the macho database were studied by minniti et al .",
    "they found that ( 1 ) they do not follow the bar in the inner regions , ( 2 ) they are very concentrated , ( 3 ) the fainter rr lyrae belong to the sgr dwarf galaxy , located behind the bulge , and ( 4 ) the period - amplitude diagram differs from that of the lmc , with larger fraction of rrc / rrab types .",
    "the large amplitude @xmath11 scuti stars in the macho bulge database were studied by minniti et al .",
    "they found that ( 1 ) these stars belong to the bulge , and not to the disk , ( 2 ) they are most likely bulge blue stragglers , ( 3 ) they are potentially good distance indicators , and ( 4 ) they are also very concentrated .      cepheid variable stars are very numerous in the magellanic clouds ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 , welch et al .",
    "1996 , sasselov et al .",
    "note , however , that there are very few cepheids candidates in the bulge database ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these few cepheids , with @xmath15 days , and @xmath16 , belong to the disk of our galaxy .",
    "the bulge population is too metal rich and too old to contain such stars .",
    "the rest of this paper will be devoted to bulge semiregular variable stars .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show the macho light curves of 4 such stars , illustrating why they are called semiregular variables .",
    "semiregulars are red giant pulsators , more numerous that miras , but with smaller amplitudes and shorter periods .",
    "they have , however , been less well studied than the miras ( see gautschy & saio 1996 , whitelock 1996 , percy et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "note that the periods used in this paper were determined from the 1993 data only .",
    "the long term period stability of these stars in not known .",
    "some of these periods may change from season to season , as a result of the semiregular behavior of these variables .",
    "for example , multiple and variable periods have been observed in some semiregulars ( e.g. mantegazza 1988 , zsoldos 1993 , lebzelter et al .",
    "1995 ) . however , the selection criteria applied to our data guarantees that during at least one season , the periods measured using both passbands agree .",
    "the selected sample of 2000 bulge semiregulars is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the onset of pulsation occurs at @xmath24 days , with low amplitudes , @xmath25 .",
    "we have not considered variables with @xmath26 , so there may be more lower amplitude semiregulars with periods @xmath27 days . the amplitudes increase with increasing periods , but they are not larger than @xmath28 .",
    "figure 5 shows that there are two sequences of semiregulars in the bulge .",
    "these sequences are better seen in the period - color diagram , where a clear separation is obtained applying the cuts @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "these sequences have stars with with @xmath31 days , and @xmath32 days , and both sequences have mean amplitudes increasing with period . as red giants evolve upwards on the giant branch ( e.g. vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) , and the semiregulars with @xmath32 days should be more evolved than the ones with @xmath31 days .",
    "indeed , the long period semiregulars tend to be redder and brighter in the mean than the short period ones .",
    "similar sequences , although much tighter , are seen in the macho lmc database ( e.g. cook et al .",
    "1996 , alves et al .",
    "we speculate that these sequences represent stars pulsating in different modes , as predicted by wood & cahn ( 1977 ) .",
    "these sequences provide a more natural classification scheme than the traditional sra and srb classes .",
    "the relation of these sequences to the longer period mira variables has not been well studied yet . unlike these longer period variables , semiregulars with @xmath20 days",
    "do not necessarily have circumstellar shells ( kerschbaum & hron 1996 ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that in the milky way disk , the kinematics and scale - heights of the semiregular variables are similar to these of the miras ( jura & kleinmann 1992 ) , suggesting that they trace similar populations . in particular , a possible extension of the mira period - luminosity relations into the shorter periods covered by the semiregular variables ( e.g. feast 1996 ) , could be useful for the determination of the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "figure 6 shows the location of the 2000 semiregular variables in the color - magnitude diagram . overplotted",
    "are 10000 stars in baade s window , a typical bulge field , showing the disk main sequence at around @xmath33 , the bulge red giant branch at @xmath34 , and the red giant branch clump at about @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the reddening independent magnitude wv is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "these diagrams illustrate that the semiregular variables are located in the bulge , and not in the foreground disk . among the reddest stars in the bulge , they are oxygen rich giants located at the tip of the bulge red giant branch .",
    "the semiregulars lie along the direction of the reddening vector in the color - magnitude diagram , mostly due to the large and non - uniform insterstellar absorption in the observed bulge fields ( note that circumstellar extinction should be reduced in the semiregulars compared with the longer period mira variables ) .",
    "the macho bulge images with exposure times of 150 sec saturate at @xmath39 , so a few of the brightest stars may have been missed .",
    "semiregular variables are bright , easy to detect , and very numerous in old stellar populations .",
    "they are fainter than miras , but more numerous .",
    "they are brighter and more numerous than rr lyrae and @xmath11 scuti stars .",
    "their luminosity is roughly comparable with cepheids , which are bluer , but they are also much more numerous .",
    "it would then be important if they could be used as distance indicators .",
    "is there a period - luminosity relation for these stars ?",
    "this question can be addressed with the macho bulge and lmc database , that contains thousands of semiregulars , located at about the same distance .",
    "figure 7 shows the period - luminosity plane for these variables .",
    "the spread in the @xmath1 magnitudes is due to the bulge line - of - sight depth , and to differential reddening . due to this scatter ,",
    "no clear dependence of @xmath1 with @xmath40 is observed .",
    "we then use the reddening independent @xmath41 magnitudes , which show smaller spread , solely due to the bulge line - of - sight depth , and also a clearer separation between the two sequences discussed above .",
    "there appears to be another sequence about 2 magnitudes fainter , containing fewer stars than the two principal sequences .",
    "this third sequence is seen in the right panel of figure 7 for @xmath42 days , and @xmath43 .",
    "these stars could be semiregulars in the sgr dwarf galaxy , located behind the bulge , at a distance of 25 kpc from the sun ( see alard 1996 and alcock et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , a similar sequence may also be present in the lmc , so the identification and interpretation remains unclear .",
    "the right panel of figure 7 shows the dependence of luminosity on the period of the stars .",
    "the inferred period - luminosity relation for the whole sample of semiregulars with @xmath0 days is : @xmath44 however , dividing into two groups , presumably representing variables pulsating in different modes , yields the following preliminary period - luminosity relations : @xmath45 @xmath46 followup observations of these variables in the near - infrared would be very useful , in order to obtain much tighter period - luminosity relations ( see feast 1996 ) .",
    "we have computed the mean reddening independent magnitudes of the semiregulars for each of the top 24 macho bulge fields .",
    "these mean magnitudes are plotted as function of galactic longitude in figure 8 .",
    "this figure shows that the bulge semiregular variables trace the bar : the semiregulars away from the galactic minor axis appear to be brighter , and therefore closer , than the ones along the minor axis .",
    "the dependence of the mean @xmath1 and @xmath2 magnitudes on galactic longitude is similar to that of the mean @xmath41 magnitudes shown in figure 8 , with somewhat larger scatter due to variable reddening .",
    "the trend seen in figure 8 follows that of the bulge clump giants ( stanek et al .",
    "1996 , alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) , and of the mira variables ( whitelock 1993 ) , which also clearly show a barred distribution .",
    "this suggests that the semiregular variables are metal - rich like the bulk of the bulge population , because metal - poor stars ( such as rr lyrae ) do not follow the bar ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "past studies of semiregular variables have not been as detailed as those of other pulsating stars like @xmath11 scuti , rr lyrae , cepheids or miras .",
    "this was partly due to the semiregular nature , which makes it necessary to have observations over extended periods of time .",
    "nonetheless , carefully selected samples of these variables can be used as distance indicators , with the advantage of being more numerous than some of these other variables .",
    "we have shown that there is a period - luminosity relation for semiregular variables in the bulge , and that they can be used as tracers of the structure of the inner milky way .",
    "in particular , we find that they follow the inner bar , like clump giants , and mira variable stars",
    ".              the current and future microlensing experiments would help solve these issues in the near future .",
    "a complete inventory of semiregular variables would also aid in the selection of real microlensing events in more distant galaxies using difference image photometry ( e.g. columbia - vatt , tomaney & crotts 1997 ; agape , ansari et al .",
