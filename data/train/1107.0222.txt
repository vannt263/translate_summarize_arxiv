    "dynamics often takes place in a changing environment .",
    "this means , given some control parameter @xmath0 and a local dynamics @xmath1 generated by some mapping @xmath2 , the control parameter @xmath0 itself will also slowly change in time . in nonequilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , these environmental fluctuations , if taking place on a large time scale , are modeled by a very useful concept , so - called superstatistics .",
    "the superstatistics concept was introduced in @xcite and has since then provided a powerful tool to describe a large variety of complex systems for which there is change of environmental conditions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to characterize the complex system under consideration by a superposition of several statistics , one corresponding to local equilibrium statistical mechanics ( on a mesoscopic level modeled by a linear langevin equation leading to locally gaussian behavior ) and the other one corresponding to a slowly varying parameter @xmath0 of the system .",
    "essential for this approach is the fact that there is sufficient time scale separation , i.e. the local relaxation time of the system must be much shorter than the typical time scale on which the parameter @xmath0 changes .    in most applications in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics the varying control parameter @xmath0 is the local inverse temperature @xmath3 of the system , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "however , in some applications beyond the immediate scope of statistical mechanics the control parameter @xmath0 can also have a different meaning .",
    "there are many interesting applications of the superstatistics concept to real - world problems , for example to train delay statistics@xcite , hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite and cancer survival statistics @xcite .",
    "further applications are described in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to extend the superstatistics concept to maps , which usually have invariant densities different from gaussian distributions , and thus analyze this problem in a more general context .",
    "our generalization assumes that the local dynamics is not anymore restricted to a linear langevin dynamics ( as in the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics applications ) , but given by an _ a priori _ arbitrary map with strong mixing properties .",
    "we will make the superstatistics concept mathematically rigorous by considering simple model examples of local maps where everything can be proved explicitly and by estimating the error terms . in our new approach",
    "described here , we allow for _ a priori _ arbitrary local invariant densities @xmath5 and consider a dynamics given by long term iteration of a map @xmath2 with slowly varying @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a mixing of various invariant densities @xmath5 with different parameter @xmath0 , in a way that we will analyze in detail in this paper .",
    "if @xmath0 changes on a long time scale , long as compared to the relaxation time of the local map @xmath2 , the resulting long - term probability distribution of iterates is closely approximated by a superposition of local invariant densities @xmath5 .",
    "for particular examples , blaschke products , we will indeed provide estimates of the error terms involved and prove how fast the birkhoff density approaches the superstatistical composition . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 changes rapidly , then a different dynamics arises which is not properly described by a mixing of the various local invariant densities .",
    "rather , in this case one has to look at fixed points of the perron - frobenius operator of higher iterates of composed maps @xmath2 with varying @xmath0 .",
    "depending on the time scale of the changes of @xmath0 , there are transition scenarios between both cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will introduce the superstatistics concept for maps .",
    "we will study several examples in this section to illustrate the concept and to motivate our rigorous treatment in the later sections . in section 3",
    "we present a rigorous theory for blaschke products .",
    "we will prove the existence of invariant measures , determine the invariant measure explicitly as a function of the parameters involved and prove our main result , an upper bound on the difference between birkhoff density and the superstatistical composition .",
    "let us consider families of maps @xmath2 depending on a control parameter @xmath0",
    ". these can be _ a priori _ arbitrary maps in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "later we will restrict ourselves to mixing maps and assume that an absolutely continuous invariant density @xmath5 exists for each value of the control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the local dynamics is @xmath6 we now allow for a time dependence of @xmath0 and study the long - term behavior of iterates given by @xmath7 clearly , the problem now requires the specification of the sequence of control parameters @xmath8 as well , at least in a statistical sense .",
    "one possibility is a periodic orbit of control parameters of length @xmath9 .",
    "another possibility is to regard the @xmath10 as random variables and to specify the properties of the corresponding stochastic process in parameter space .",
    "in general , rapidly fluctuating parameters @xmath10 will lead to a very complicated dynamics .",
    "however , there is a significant simplification if the parameters @xmath10 change slowly .",
    "this is the analogue of the slowly varying temperature parameters in the superstatistical treatment of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "the basic assumption of superstatistics is that an environmental control parameter @xmath0 changes only very slowly , much slower than the local relaxation time of the dynamics . for maps",
    "this means that significant changes of @xmath0 occur only over a large number @xmath11 of iterations . in practice",
    ", one can model this superstatistical case as follows : one keeps @xmath12 constant for @xmath11 iterations ( @xmath13 ) , then switches after @xmath11 iterations to a new value @xmath14 , after @xmath11 iterations one switches to the next values @xmath15 , and so on .",
    "one of the simplest examples is a period-2 orbit in the parameter space .",
    "that is , we have an alternating sequence @xmath16 that repeats itself , with switching between the two possible values taking place after @xmath11 iterations .",
    "we are interested in the long - term behavior of iterates obtained for @xmath17 .",
    "possible sequences of parameters @xmath18 of period length @xmath9 could be studied equally well , with a switching to the new parameter value always taking place after @xmath13 iterations .",
    "another possibility are stochastic parameter changes on the long time scale @xmath11 .    to illustrate and motivate the superstatistics concept for maps",
    ", we will now deal with three important examples of families of maps @xmath2 .    * example 1 * we take for @xmath2 the asymmetric tent map on @xmath19 $ ] given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this example is somewhat trivial , because the invariant density @xmath5 is independent of @xmath0 and given by the uniform distribution for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "hence , whatever the statistics of the varying parameter sequence @xmath22 is , we get for the long - term distribution of iterates given by ( [ it ] ) , ( [ atent ] ) the uniform distribution @xmath23    * example 2 * we take for @xmath2 a map of linear langevin type @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath2 is a 2-dimensional map given by a skew product of the form @xmath24 here @xmath25 denote the average of iterates of @xmath26 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that for @xmath27 , @xmath28 finite this deterministic chaotic map generates a dynamics equivalent to a linear langevin equation @xcite , provided the map @xmath26 has the so - called @xmath29-mixing property @xcite , and regarding the initial values @xmath30 $ ] as a smoothly distributed random variable . consequently , in this limit the variable @xmath31 converges to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite and its stationary density is given by @xmath32 the variance parameter @xmath3 of this gaussian depends on the map @xmath26 and the damping constant @xmath0 .",
    "if the parameter @xmath0 changes on a very large time scale , much larger than the local relaxation time to equilibrium , one expects for the long - term distribution of iterates a mixture of gaussian distributions with different variances @xmath33 .",
    "for example , a period 2 orbit of parameter changes yields a mixture of two gaussians @xmath34 generally , for more complicated parameter changes on the long time scale @xmath11 , the long - term distribution of iterates @xmath31 will be mixture of gaussians with a suitable weight function @xmath35 for @xmath27 : @xmath36 this is just the usual form of superstatistics used in statistical mechanics , based on a mixture of gaussians with fluctuating variance with a given weight function @xcite .",
    "thus for this example of skew products the superstatistics of the map @xmath2 reproduces the concept of superstatistics in nonequilibrium statitistical mechanics , based on the langevin equation .",
    "in fact , the map @xmath2 can be regarded as a possible microscopic dynamics underlying the langevin equation .",
    "the random forces pushing the particle left and right are in this case generated by deterministic chaotic map @xmath26 governing the dynamics of the variable @xmath37 .",
    "generally it is possible to consider any @xmath29-mixing map here @xcite .",
    "based on functional limit theorems , one can prove equivalence with the langevin equation in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "* example 3 : blaschke products * we now want to consider further examples beyond the immediate scope of statistical mechanics where the invariant density of the local map is non - gaussian but still a full analytic treatment is possible .",
    "consider mappings of a complex variable @xmath38 given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we are interested in a dynamics restricted to the unit circle @xmath44 and write @xmath45 as @xmath46 so that @xmath47 . according to martin @xcite , and as established in the following sections in much more detail , the invariant density of @xmath48 with respect to the variable @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 here @xmath51 is a fixed point of @xmath48 .",
    "blaschke products usually exhibit very strong chaotic behaviour and can be used as the map @xmath26 in equation ( [ ggg ] ) if an extension to a langevin dynamics is wished for for physical reasons .",
    "the remarkable property of blaschke products is that the knowledge of a fixed point @xmath52 of the map uniquely fixes the shape of the invariant density @xmath53 , making an analytic treatment very convenient .",
    "transformation of variables @xmath54 yields the invariant density @xmath55 with respect to the variable @xmath29 as @xmath56 here @xmath0 denotes the real part and @xmath57 the imaginary part of the fixed point @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath58 .    for @xmath59 we get @xmath60 and hence @xmath61 .",
    "this is just the invariant density of a @xmath62-ary shift map on [ 0,1 ] , noting that for @xmath63 the blaschke product becomes @xmath64    another example would be a blaschke product with a real fixed point @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the invariant density is @xmath66 a particular example , taken from @xcite , is @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 the fixed point condition @xmath51 is solved by @xmath69 this is a unique fixed point in the unit disk @xmath70 .",
    "we are now in a position to explicitly do superstatistics for blaschke products , since the invariant densities are known explicitly as a function of the parameters of the map . while a rigorous treatment will be worked out in detail in the following sections , we here just consider a simple example to illustrate the general idea .",
    "let us consider two different blaschke products , and a periodic orbit of length 2 of the parameters .",
    "for example , we may consider an alternating dynamics of the two maps @xmath71 if we iterate @xmath72 for a long time @xmath11 , then iterate @xmath73 for the same long time @xmath11 , then switch back to @xmath72 , then to @xmath73 , and so on , the birkhoff density will be a mixture of both invariant densities . in the @xmath29 variable",
    "we expect to get for @xmath74 the superstatistical result @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "this will be confirmed by our rigorous treatment in the following section . if , on the other hand , we switch maps after each iteration step , the result will be different . in this case",
    "we need to determine the invariant density of the composed map @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 , depending on which map is iterated first ) .",
    "the composed map is again a blaschke product , now with @xmath79 : @xmath80 the fixed point condition @xmath81 yields @xmath82 and hence the invariant density of @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 similarly the other composed map is also a blaschke product with @xmath79 : @xmath85 the fixed point condition @xmath86 yields @xmath87 and hence the invariant density of @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 the birkhoff density , which describes the long - term distribution of iterates independent of the phase of the periodic orbit , is then given by @xmath90 .",
    "1 shows the densities @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( dashed lines ) , the birkhoff density @xmath93 ( dotted line ) and the superstatistical composition @xmath94 ( solid line ) as a function of @xmath29 .    apparently , all curves are different .",
    "but the difference between birkhoff density @xmath95 and the superstatistical composition @xmath96 will decrease if the time scale @xmath11 of switching between parameters is increased .",
    "there is a transition scenario from the birkhoff density to the superstatistical result @xmath94 for @xmath74 .    in the following sections we will make our results rigorous , by proving statements for the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures of blaschke products and estimating the relevant error terms of the superstatistical composition",
