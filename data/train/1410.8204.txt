    "with the increasing improvement of stellar observations and the introduction of new types of observations , it becomes possible to constrain the processes involved and test the validity of the underlying physics .",
    "here we focus specifically on subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars which have been detected to have g - mode pulsations , and we use the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) code @xcite for comparison with observational constraints , with particular emphasis on mixing in the deep interior , a major unsolved problem in stellar evolution .",
    "subdwarf b stars are hot ( @xmath5 ) and compact ( @xmath6 ) stars that are found in all stellar populations of our own galaxy as well as in other old galaxies . located on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) , they are understood to be helium burning objects with very thin hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "while it is well known that they will directly evolve to become white dwarfs once their central helium is exhausted , the details and the relative importance of the various evolutionary channels leading to the ehb are still poorly understood .",
    "numerous single and binary star scenarios have been proposed @xcite .",
    "many sdb stars exhibit stellar pulsations , the shorter ( @xmath8 ) pressure(p)-mode pulsations found in hotter v361 hya stars @xcite and the longer ( @xmath9 or longer ) gravity(g)-mode pulsations in cooler v1093 her stars @xcite , or both , in hybrid pulsators called dw lyn stars @xcite .",
    "detailed work has recently been done to reproduce the observed pulsational properties of sdb stars with stellar evolution models .",
    "it has been shown that time - dependent diffusive processes , including mass loss , gravitational settling , and radiative levitation @xcite are important to recover the iron - group opacity bump that excites the pulsations @xcite in these stars , as well as the correct position of the instability strip in the @xmath10 diagram @xcite .",
    "pulsational frequencies derived from light curves of p- and g - mode sdb pulsators using ground - based as well as space - borne ( i.e.  corot and kepler ) instruments have been analyzed by asteroseismology . using the forward method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "asteroseismology of g - mode pulsators also provides observational benchmarks for the inner structure of those stars , e.g.  the extent of the inner convection zone and the nature of the abundance gradient * above * the boundary . @xcite and @xcite recently derived sdb he - co convective core masses for the first time from asteroseismology of three g - mode pulsators : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and either @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "all three stars were determined to be significantly less than halfway through their he - burning lifetimes , having consumed only about 20% to 40% of the helium fuel in their cores .",
    "standard stellar evolution , without any additional mixing at the boundary of the convective core , predicts a constant convective core mass of @xmath15 for these stars .",
    "when some form of overshoot and semiconvection @xcite , partial mixing @xcite or atomic diffusion @xcite is included , the models produce growing convective cores , with masses up to @xmath16 to @xmath17 at an evolutionary stage comparable to the sdb stars whose convective cores were inferred from asteroseismology .",
    "sweigart and dorman achieved semiconvective or partially mixed cores that extended up to @xmath18 by the end of the he core burning lifetime , but the observations indicate that such large cores are achieved much earlier .    the forward modeling method implemented by both van grootel and charpinet to analyse sdb",
    "asteroseismic data uses static stellar models covering a much larger range of parameter space than theoretical models that are constrained to lie along evolutionary tracks . since their results are independent of evolutionary calculations , this allows us to test various physics options in a state - of - the - art stellar evolution code ( mesa ) .    for this paper",

    "turbulent convection is an essential process of energy transport in stars .",
    "macroscopic mass elements start to rise ( or sink ) in dynamically unstable regions , delivering their excess ( or deficit ) of heat to cooler ( or hotter ) layers and thus transport energy and material throughout the star .",
    "this is a non - linear process governed by the navier - stokes equation , and occurs on the dynamical timescale .",
    "mesa treats the mixing of convective elements as a `` diffusive '' process , as do most stellar evolution codes .",
    "this `` diffusion '' operator is chosen for mathematical convenience @xcite , based on parameters estimated from the mixing length theory @xcite as formulated by @xcite .    to estimate the extent of dynamically unstable regions , two criteria of linear stability",
    "are implemented in mesa .",
    "the standard schwarzschild criterion for instability , @xmath19 and the ledoux criterion , taking radial composition gradients @xmath20 into account , @xmath21 where @xmath22 historically , convective mixing was supposed to occur in the region in which the schwarzschild condition ( eq .  [ schw ] ) was violated ; we will call this _",
    "canonical mixing_. in addition to this canonical mixing , it has proven desirable to consider additional mixing processes ( some of which are not truly different , but overlooked in the stellar approximation to turbulent hydrodynamics ) .",
    "the term _ overshoot _ refers to the transport of energy and material across the boundary from the dynamically unstable region into the dynamically stable region . the additional mixing",
    "is calculated using the diffusion coefficient from the previous mlt calculations near the boundary layer and extrapolates it into the radiative region with an exponential decay , following @xcite ; this procedure is based on simulations of fluids in shallow convection zones , of homogeneous composition @xcite .",
    "it has no compositional dependence .",
    "the additional term is referred to as the overshoot mixing diffusion coefficient , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the previously calculated diffusion coefficient at a user defined location close to the schwarzschild boundary , @xmath25 is the local pressure scale height , and @xmath26 is the distance of overshoot into the radiative layer . the local pressure scale height is the exponential attenuation length for g - mode waves @xcite , and it is assumed that overshoot falls off as wave energy .",
    "the free parameter @xmath27 sets the extent of the overshooting region and needs to be adjusted by the user depending on the problem .",
    "in @xcite an @xmath27-parameter of @xmath28 0.004 to 0.015 was used to calculate models of a non - rotating @xmath29 star .",
    "@xcite used an overshoot parameter of @xmath30 for his study of @xmath31 and @xmath32 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "georges michaud led in the application of true _ diffusion _ processes and radiative levitation to stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "these processes have been applied to horizontal branch ( hb ) and sdb stars by @xcite .",
    "@xcite defined atomic diffusion to include gravitational settling , thermal diffusion , concentration diffusion , and radiative levitation .",
    "atomic diffusion in mesa includes all of these processes except radiative leviation , which is a separate option .",
    "gravitational settling and radiative levitation are particularly important to recover the iron - group opacity bump that excites the pulsations in these stars @xcite , the correct position of the instability strip in the @xmath10 diagram @xcite , and help in understanding their observed atmospheric abundances @xcite .",
    "we will further examine the effects of atomic diffusion on the deep interior in ",
    "[ conv_core_section ] .",
    "the stellar evolution calculations were done with version 7184 of mesa @xcite in order to extend the results of @xcite .",
    "mesa offers a variety of up - to - date physics modules , including several mlt convection options , and is capable of evolving stars through the he - flash , a crucial part of the evolutionary path to sdb stars .",
    "the latter is modeled as a quasi - static process , with mlt mixing , as a substitute for the full dynamical process .    because our main goal was to devise a simple model that allowed us to focus on the inner convection zone of the star , we used standard values and descriptions for the input physics , varying the defaults for consistency with the observational data , as described below .",
    "the physics options adopted for our standard models are summarized in table  [ simulationphysics ] .",
    "they include an atmospheric boundary condition of @xmath33 and a mixing length parameter of @xmath34 .",
    "we further selected a nuclear network designed to include all reactions for hydrogen and helium burning .",
    "representative abundances of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 were adopted , because most well - studied ( i.e.  nearby ) sdb stars belong to the field population of the galactic disk @xcite , and the few that are found in old open clusters ( where their progenitors abundances can be measured ) appear to be preferentially metal - rich ( see  [ obs constraints ] ) .",
    "we used the reimers wind scheme @xcite with @xmath38 on the red giant branch ( rgb ) . for the post - ehb phase we used the blcker wind scheme @xcite with @xmath39 .",
    "mesa offers the opacity tables of @xcite and includes their opal type i opacity tables with fixed metal distributions as the default option .",
    "however , the interior abundances of carbon and oxygen in sdb stars change enough to modify the opacity , not only during he burning on the ehb , but also during their prior evolution , in particular during the he flash and the subsequent transition to the zaehb .",
    "it is therefore necessary to use the opal type ii opacity tables which allow for time dependent variation of the c and o abundances .",
    "mesa includes electron conduction opacities @xcite as the default case .",
    "electron conduction becomes the dominant energy transport mechanism in significantly degenerate stellar cores and is thus required for our study .",
    "mixing due to atomic diffusion has been traditionally assumed to be small during stellar evolution , but it is necessary to obtain the correct structure to excite pulsations in sdb stars and reproduce the observed instability strips @xcite . as chemical diffusion smoothes out abundance gradients at the boundary of the convective core , this diffusion , combined with time dependent opacities , allows the convective core to grow during the sdb evolution .",
    "this was first noted by @xcite in the context of somewhat more massive , but essentially similar , hb stars .",
    "hence we included type ii opacities as well as atomic diffusion processes in all of our stellar evolution calculations , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we deliberately did not include radiative levitation in our set of standard parameters since it is computationally very expensive and has little to no effect on the interior mixing regions of the sdb models ( see  [ conv_core_section ] ) .",
    "mesa calculates the enthalpy flux from standard mixing length theory @xcite , using either the schwarzschild or ledoux stability criterion . with the latter , semiconvection",
    "may be included @xcite .",
    "our initial investigation of the effects of semiconvection on the convective cores of sdb stars showed that semiconvection , as implemented in mesa , has little effect on the convective core sizes .",
    "the ledoux criterion with maximal semiconvection gives convective core sizes similar to those obtained with the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "convective overshoot is implemented according to @xcite . in  [ conv_core_section ]",

    "these apparently very common scenarios are believed to occur in binary systems where the companion strips away the hydrogen envelope of the expanding progenitor star as the latter evolves toward the tip of the rgb . when most of the red giant envelope is removed , hydrogen shell burning is quenched , the he - core stops growing , and the star begins to contract away from the rgb .",
    "if the helium core is sufficiently massive for the contraction to trigger helium ignition , the star will evolve onto the ehb and begin burning he in its core as an sdb star .    for simplicity",
    ", we simulated the effect of binary mass stripping by removing the envelopes of non - rotating single stars .",
    "both spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and asteroseismology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that sdb stars are generally slow rotators , except those that have been spun up to some degree by a binary companion .",
    "our assumption that rotation does not play an important role even in the interiors of sdb stars is based on available asteroseismic evidence , which suggests rigid rotation in both binary and single sdb stars for the few cases so far in which the interior rotation could be constrained @xcite .",
    "our first step was to create pre - main - sequence ( pms ) models , which are specified by their initial mass @xmath43 , a uniform composition , a luminosity and a central temperature ( @xmath44 by default ) .",
    "once the pms routine found the central density @xmath45 that gives the model the desired mass , we evolved the star up to the point of the he - flash . just before the flash occurred , we saved the structure as our sdb progenitor model .",
    "our procedure provides an _ upper _ limit to the he core mass of the resulting sdb star , since the progenitor could have been stripped prior to the he flash when the he core mass was up to @xmath46 smaller and it would still have evolved onto the ehb @xcite .    for the next step ,",
    "we stripped away mass from the sdb progenitor model beginning with the outermost cell using the ` relax_mass ` option of mesa .",
    "this option ensures that the mass of the star is adjusted to the specified value of ` new_mass ` .",
    "the mass loss occurs in a series of small episodes until the requested new mass is reached .",
    "then the code begins the actual stellar evolution toward the zero age ehb ( zaehb ) .",
    "mass loss continues to occur between the rgb tip and the zaehb . using this method",
    ", we reduced the hydrogen envelope down to typical values for sdb stars in the range of @xmath47 .",
    "this simple mass loss procedure differs from the real dynamics in that it is modeled as a quasi - static process .",
    "the full 3d well - resolved hydrodynamics for a binary star over evolutionary timescales is still beyond the capability of modern computation .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we adopted a more tractable approach .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of sdb stars are primarily influenced by two factors , the mass of the he core after the envelope has been stripped , and the amount of remaining hydrogen envelope . as seen in previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the initial mass of the progenitor star , @xmath43 , determines the mass of the he core at the he flash and therefore the approximate total mass of our sdb stars , subject to a very small dependence on composition . for ages appropriate for old disk stars ( @xmath48 gyr ) , the more massive the progenitor star , the earlier",
    "the star begins helium fusion and thus the less massive the he core . for a given he core mass ,",
    "the tiny envelope mass is decided by the parameter @xmath49 , the new stellar mass after stripping off the envelope .",
    "qualitatively speaking , the more massive the sdb envelope , the lower the effective temperature and the surface gravity . in our survey set of calculations , we varied the initial mass , @xmath43 , between @xmath50 and the new mass parameter , @xmath49 , between @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we compare the results of our sdb modeling with observational data and with other stellar evolution calculations .",
    "we created a range of sdb models using standard mlt ( i.e.   excluding overshoot and semiconvection ) and the schwarzschild criterion to explore the effects of varying the initial mass , @xmath43 , and stripped mass , @xmath49 , on our sdb models .",
    "we show that our models are quite consistent with previous calculations of sdb stars .",
    "the distances to field sdb stars are only approximate , so luminosities can not be accurately calculated .",
    "however , since effective temperatures and surface gravities can be inferred from a variety of methods and the masses of most sdb stars are very similar , they are typically plotted in the @xmath10 plane instead of an hr diagram .",
    "figure  [ sdbtracks1 ] shows the zaehb ( lower dashed line ) and evolutionary tracks ( solid lines ) for our set of sdb models with @xmath52 and a range of @xmath49 .",
    "the tracks cover only the period of helium core burning , when the star is characterized as an sdb star . for comparison ,",
    "we plot observed spectroscopic data derived with the use of nlte model atmospheres @xcite , along with results from binary modeling and asteroseismology @xcite .",
    "( although fontaine listed spectroscopic values for the effective temperatures , because they are poorly constrained by asteroseismology , we show the asteroseismic values for @xmath53 whenever they were available . )",
    "our models reproduce the characteristic hook - shaped sdb evolutionary tracks , corresponding to stable helium core burning , as well as the shape of the zaehb .",
    "the tracks overlap the distribution of the observational data points fairly well , except for a small overall shift toward lower @xmath53 and/or higher @xmath54 .",
    "figure[sdbtracks2 ] shows the zaehb ( lower dashed line ) and the corresponding tracks ( solid lines ) for a different sequence of sdb models evolved from an initial mass of @xmath55 . the resulting he core masses , and therefore the total sdb masses , are about @xmath56 smaller than in the case of the @xmath57 progenitor .",
    "the zaehb for the @xmath57 progenitor sequence of figure[sdbtracks1 ] is shown ( upper dashed line ) for comparison .",
    "it is also apparent from figure[sdbtracks2 ] that the three g - mode sdb stars whose convective core masses were derived from asteroseismology ( plotted as open ellipses ) have not evolved very far from the zaehb s appropriate for their masses .",
    "details for the sequences of evolutionary tracks in figures[sdbtracks1 ] and [ sdbtracks2 ] are given in table  [ 1_2msun_table ] .",
    "the average sdb mass , the total mass of hydrogen ( essentially all in the envelope ) , and the extent of the inner convection zone of the sdb star are averaged over the time of helium core burning ( the sdb lifetime ) .",
    "we also provided the zaehb core and envelope masses for all stellar models .    in agreement with previous hb / ehb stellar models , a smaller he core mass with the same set of envelope masses",
    "shifts the zaehb in the direction of lower effective temperatures and slightly higher surface gravities , whereas a different envelope mass for the same core mass slides the starting point of the sdb track up or down along the zaehb .",
    "therefore , mass loss between the he flash and the zaehb results in hotter , higher - gravity sdb tracks , but the position of the zaehb does not change .",

    "the helium core mass is so low that the stars start helium fusion before the material in the helium core becomes degenerate .",

    "our model sdb tracks from figure[sdbtracks1 ] ( @xmath70 ) also agree well with dorman s , spanning essentially the same range in @xmath10 space , although ours are slightly shifted to lower temperatures and gravities due to @xmath71 smaller he cores .    for a further comparison , we constructed two zaehbs from a he main - sequence star with a core mass of @xmath72 using type i opacities as well as type ii .",
    "type ii opacities differ from type i because of the composition change of c and o during thermonuclear evolution .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ dormancomparison ] that type i opacities shift the evolutionary tracks away from the distribution of observed sdb stars .",
    "the significant size of this effect indicates the importance of the opacities for the position of the zaehb .",
    "our use of opal type ii opacities , instead of the mesa default type i opacities , appears to be the main reason why our ehb evolutionary tracks agree more closely with the observed points than those of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 core mass , type ii zaehb we constructed was also found to be essentially identical with the zaehb derived by fontaine and collaborators from static models having the same core mass ( fontaine , priv .",
    "their models include radiative levitation as well as gravitational settling , and use opacities equivalent to opal type ii in mesa .    in figure  [ bloemencomparison ] , we compare our sdb models from figure  [ sdbtracks1 ] to models by @xcite .",
    "we chose a subset of their models having sdb masses closest to our models .",
    "theirs all have a total sdb mass of @xmath72 with slightly different he core masses of @xmath73 ( from bottom to top ) .",
    "since @xcite and @xcite focused on the pulsational properties of the sdb stars , they specifically included radiative levitation in order to recover the iron - group opacity bump .",
    "they used opacities from the opacity project @xcite , which are independent of opal type ii opacities .",
    "the bloemen et al .",
    "evolutionary tracks agree remarkably well with our tracks computed without radiative levitation , indicating that this process has little effect on the shapes or the position in the @xmath10 diagram .",
    "we conclude that mesa models with our standard set of input parameters ( table  [ simulationphysics ] ) , are therefore quite capable of reproducing the zaehb and evolutionary tracks of sdb stars derived using other stellar codes , as long as the he core masses and opacities are essentially the same .",
    "the small offset of our sdb tracks relative to the observational points in figure[sdbtracks1 ] could therefore be due to either the evolutionary he core masses or the opacities .",
    "the canonical timescale for the sdb lifetime is about @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we calculated sdb lifetimes of approximately @xmath75 for @xmath70 ( top part of table  [ 1_2msun_table ] ) , in fair agreement with the earlier values , and in very good agreement with @xcite , do who found lifetimes of approximately @xmath76 ( from bottom to top ) for the four models shown in figure[bloemencomparison ] .",
    "we note that the lifetimes in our simulations are not monotonic functions of mass , but depend upon details of the mixing algorithms , which seem to be very sensitive to the initial conditions(see  [ conv_core_section ] ) .",
    "the smoothest evolutionary tracks are those in which mixing is dominated by atomic diffusion .",
    "our models show a growing convective core starting from @xmath15 at the zaehb up to @xmath18 at core he exhaustion . to compare our results with the convective core masses inferred from asteroseismology , we calculated time - averaged convective core masses as listed in table  [ 1_2msun_table ] .",
    "the @xmath70 sequence average core masses are in the range of @xmath77 which is substantially smaller than the values found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "according to a study of the empirical mass distribution of sdb stars @xcite , the median value of the sdb mass is @xmath78 , with the range from @xmath79 containing @xmath80 of the stars .",
    "the maximum masses of our evolutionary sdb models lie within this range , but they are somewhat smaller than the median of the observed distribution .",
    "the he core mass on the zaehb is determined by the core mass at the point when the hydrogen shell burning is quenched near the tip of the rgb , whether it is extinguished prematurely by mass stripping or by the onset of the he flash . any mass loss occurring between the rgb tip and the zaehb only reduces the amount of residual hydrogen envelope ; uncertainties in the mass loss rates would merely shift the sdb along the zaehb appropriate to its core mass .",
    "we therefore investigated the effects on the core mass due to the interplay of initial mass , initial composition and conditions during the he flash .",
    "the results are compiled in table  [ heflashmasses ] .",
    "larger initial masses than @xmath57 always produce smaller he cores .",
    "initial masses smaller than @xmath57 would produce larger he cores in the absence of winds , but winds reduce the mass of the he core at the he flash for lower mass stars . if the actual mass loss rates on the ms and rgb were much smaller than predicted by the reimers formula as implemented in mesa ( with a coefficient of 0.5 ) , initial masses lower than @xmath81 could result in slightly larger he core masses .",
    "however , since stars with @xmath43 smaller than about @xmath57 have not had time to evolve to the rgb tip in the lifetime of the galactic disk , varying the initial mass of the mesa progenitor stars does not help to produce larger he cores than we get from our standard model .",
    "next we investigated the effect of different initial compositions .",
    "table  [ heflashmasses ] shows that reducing the initial metallicity to @xmath82 and the helium abundances to @xmath83 would increase the he core masses to @xmath84 , i.e.  to the median mass of the empirical mass distribution .",
    "however , since we could not realistically account for he core masses much higher than @xmath85 with composition changes alone , some additional factor would still be required to produce model sdb stars corresponding to the upper half of the observed mass distribution .    even when sdb models are constructed to have he core masses of @xmath86 , or even @xmath87 , the resulting zaehb s still appear to be a bit too far to the lower right in the @xmath10 diagram .",
    "this is true for other stellar models as well as ours .",
    "according to the empirical distribution , a third of the observed points in figure[dormancomparison ] should have evolved from zaehb s corresponding to he core masses between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "instead , the type ii opacity zaehb for @xmath90 ( upper / blue dashed line ) appears to fall significantly below the lower envelope of the vast majority of observed points .",
    "similarly , the upper envelope of observed points in figures  [ sdbtracks1 ] and [ bloemencomparison ] seems overpopulated , especially since the evolution is much faster as the stars begin to exhaust the he in their cores .",

    "it turns out that there are no other well - studied clusters with ages @xmath102 6 gyr and supersolar metallicities .",
    "however , it is possible to compare the statistics of sdb stars in clusters that are comparably old and more metal - poor , or somewhat younger and comparably metal - rich , or both younger and more metal - poor . while few open clusters have been definitively searched for hot stars at ultraviolet wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "significantly lower initial helium , and perhaps lower metallicities , can produce slightly larger core masses by the time of the he flash , but such low abundances are incompatible with the statistics of sdb cluster members presented above .",
    "most importantly , our models were evolved almost to the onset of the he flash before the envelope stripping was initiated .",
    "assuming that sdb stars lose the last of their envelopes just as the he core flash is about to begin requires an unrealistic fine - tuning of the initial binary parameters . instead",

    "it might be thought that our inability to produce higher he core masses is related to the net rates of the helium burning reactions which are used as defaults in mesa , indicating that these rates might need revision .",
