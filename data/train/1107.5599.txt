    "a net flow of particles under unbiased external fluctuations / drive due to an asymmetric potential , which is called ratchet effect , has received much attention during the last decades .",
    "the transport and dynamical properties of particles on asymmetric potential have been widely studied , e.g. , in physics and biology @xcite .",
    "random motion of particles can be rectified in such an asymmetric system , which can be used for , e.g. , controlling particles motion , separating different types of particles ( i.e. , molecular sieves ) , for both underdamped and overdamped particles @xcite and for molecular motors @xcite .",
    "vortices in a type ii superconductor often ( e.g. , for magnetic field close to @xmath3 ) can be treated as classical overdamped  particles \" .",
    "most of the experiments on vortex motion rectification used arrays of asymmetric pinning sites ( e.g. , nanoengineered antidots or triangular magnetic dots / inpurties ) to create an asymmetric potential , which rectifies the motion of vortices @xcite . the rectified vortex motion was directly observed in experiments by imaging vortices via lorentz microscopy @xcite .",
    "periodic arrangement of point defects of a gradual density or periodic square array of ferromagnetic dots of decreasing size , i.e. , varying the density of pinning sites or the size of pinning sites , were shown to result in a ratchet potential @xcite .",
    "when vortices are trapped by pinning sites , the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction creates a higher energy barrier near the area with higher density of pinning sites .",
    "therefore , an asymmetric potential can be created by the gradient of the density of pinning sites @xcite . even without spatial asymmetry ( i.e. , without any asymmetric walls / boundaries or asymmetric pinning sites ) ,",
    "the motion of vortices still can be controlled by time - asymmetric driving force @xcite . due to the possibility of controlling their motion ,",
    "the dynamical behavior of vortices in such systems has attracted considerable interest .",
    "a series of elastic and plastic vortex flow phases were found @xcite . besides the liquid - like and solid lattice phase , vortex motion also revealed a jamming behavior @xcite .",
    "when the density of vortices is changed , the vortex flowing direction can change to the opposite @xcite , which means vortices can drift in either the  hard \" direction or the  easy \" direction of the ratchet , depending on the vortex density . by controlling the motion of vortices ,",
    "it is possible to remove vortices or reduce the vortex density by using a combination of two opposite oriented ratchet arrays @xcite .",
    "the order of vortices and commensurability between vortices and cells also play an important role in vortex dynamics @xcite . in two -",
    "dimensional ( 2d ) ratchets , the dynamics in the transverse ratchet was also studied in theory @xcite and in experiments @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the dynamics of vortices in a circular channel formed by asymmetric triangular ( funnel ) cells ( tcs ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] ) [ note that earlier this approach to form asymmetric channels in experiment ( i.e. , using weak - pinning channels ) was employed in a stripe geometry  @xcite ] . due to the radially flowing current in a corbino setup ,",
    "the driving force is not uniform inside the cell which is different from linear ratchet channels .",
    "such a geometry ( i.e. , asymmetric in the azimuthal direction and in the radial direction ) , as will be shown , leads to a specific dynamical behavior , for example , a vortex located near the inner corner of a tc ( which is closer to the center ) , experiences a stronger driving force and moves to the next tc while a vortex located near the outer corner of tc does not move .",
    "the circular geometry of the ratchet channel is convenient for studying commensurability and step - motor ( phase locking ) behavior @xcite .",
    "we analyze in detail low and high density regimes of rectification , i.e. ,  single - vortex \" and  multi - vortex \" regimes .",
    "we demonstrate that the mechanism of rectification are qualitatively different for these two cases .",
    "in addition , we have performed preliminary measurements using a single nanofabricated weak - pinning ratchet channel of a - nbge with strong - pinning nbn channel edges in a corbino set - up , and we observed a substantial asymmetric vortex response .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in sec .",
    "ii , the model of our systems will be presented . then in sec .",
    "iii , we will show how the density of vortices and the frequency of driving current influences the dynamical behavior of vortices .",
    "commensurability effects of vortex density and of the frequency of current will be discussed in sec .",
    "we present the measurements of a vortex ratchet in a corbino geometry in sec .",
    "v. finally , the conclusions will be given in sec .",
    "we consider a ring - like weak - pinning channel constructed of @xmath4 partially overlapping tcs as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geo ] . in our simulations ,",
    "the radius of the ring @xmath5 is typically set as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field penetration depth , the wider part of the channel ( i.e. , the base of tcs ) @xmath8 , and the width of the narrow part @xmath9 ( the neck ) is typically 0.1 of the wider part ( i.e. , the ratio @xmath10 ) .",
    "we also performed simulations in a channel with a wider neck part , e.g. , @xmath11 , for comparison .",
    "the weak - pinning channel ( where vortices can move freely ) is surrounded by a strong - pinning superconducting material @xcite which is modeled by a medium where vortices can not move .",
    "an external current @xmath0 radially flows from the center of the disk to the edge , resulting in the density of current @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the closer a vortex to the center of the disk , the stronger the lorentz force that acts on it .",
    "the driving force due to the radial current is @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unit vector in the azimuthal direction in the disk plane , @xmath15 is the unit of force , @xmath16 is the dimensionless driving current , and @xmath17 is the flux quantum .",
    "we perform langevin - type molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and numerically integrate the overdamped equations of motion @xcite : @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionless viscosity coefficient which is set here to unity .",
    "we note that in practice the viscosity coefficient @xcite varies between different superconductors . as an example , parameters for a - nbge , a typical weak - pinning material , correspond to @xmath21  ns / m@xmath22 @xcite . using this value of @xmath20 in our calculations results in typical maximum values of vortex linear velocity @xmath23",
    "m / s ( for a 1@xmath24m - thick film ) , which approaches , but does not exceed , the larkin - ovchinnikov critical velocity for this material @xcite .",
    "the vortex interaction @xmath25 is described by a first order of the modified bessel function of the second kind @xmath26 , and the thermal force obeys @xmath27 and @xmath28     +     +    to model the vortex - boundary interaction , we assume an infinite potential wall at the boundary ( i.e. , vortices can not leave the channel ) which decays inside the triangular cell with the same dependence on position as the vortex - vortex interaction potential . the total interaction of a vortex with the channel boundaries",
    "is calculated by integrating the vortex - wall interaction potential over the geometrical boundary of the channel .",
    "the resulting potential due to the boundary is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , and the vortex - boundary force @xmath29 is directly calculated from the potential .    in our simulations",
    ", we first set @xmath30 , when no current is applied , and then gradually decrease temperature to let the system to relax to the ground state . then we set @xmath31 and apply an external driving , i.e. , an ac current resulting in oscillating lorentz force with frequency @xmath32 and amplitude @xmath33 that acts on vortices , to study the dynamics of the system .",
    "the vortex density , i.e. , the number of vortices per tc , plays an important role in the dynamics of the system . for very low vortex density ,",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction is small as compared to the interaction with the boundary , and therefore it can be neglected . with increasing the vortex density",
    ", the interaction between vortices becomes important .",
    "therefore , we roughly distinguish two regimes , i.e. , a single - vortex regime and a multi - vortex regime , respectively , corresponding to low and high vortex density .            in order to characterize the dynamical behavior of the system of vortices ,",
    "we calculate the net angular velocity of each vortex and take average over all the vortices for , e.g. , 100 ac periods .",
    "the resulting average angular velocity ( called further `` angular velocity '' ) is denoted as @xmath1 which is analyzed for different parameters of the system and drivings .",
    "we note that angular velocity can be related in a straightforward way to the flux - flow voltage @xcite that one would typically measure in an experiment .",
    "one system contains @xmath34 vortices and @xmath4 triangles in a circular chain , e.g. , in our simulations we take @xmath35 . if there is less than one vortex per cell , i.e. , @xmath36 in our system ( see fig . [",
    "fig : geo ] ) , then the density of vortices is low enough and one can neglect the interaction between vortices .",
    "one can imagine that all the vortices are far away from each other and weakly interact with other vortices but they are strongly influenced by the ratchet potential induced by the boundary .",
    "therefore , the dynamical behavior in the low density case is similar to that of the system with just one vortex [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom ] ( a ) ] , which is considered in the single - vortex regime .",
    "thus , for @xmath37 , the maximum of the angular velocity is the same value [ see fig . [",
    "fig : iw_incom ] ( a ) ] . when the density increases and therefore the interaction between the vortices becomes appreciable , the maximum of the angular velocity @xmath38 first decreases to 0.05 for @xmath39 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom ] ( b ) ] and then starts to increase [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom ] ( c ) ] when the system turns to the regime of high vortex density .    to understand this non - monotonic behavior of the maximum of the angular velocity @xmath38 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom](d ) ] , we studied the trajectories of moving vortices .",
    "when the system is in the single - vortex regime , where @xmath40 , all the vortices move along a nearly circular trajectory no matter whether the applied current is small or large , which can be considered as a one - dimensional ( 1d ) motion ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_low ] ) . for low driving currents ,",
    "each vortex oscillates near its initial position inside a tc [ e.g. , see fig . [",
    "fig : trace_low ] ( a ) ] , and when the driving force reaches some critical value , all the vortices move with a net angular velocity @xmath1 in the easy direction [ e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_low ] ( b ) ] .",
    "however , in the multi - vortex regime , i.e. , the high density case ( e.g. , @xmath41 ) , the motion of vortices is not 1d any more . the ac current drives vortices to pass through the narrow part ( i.e. , neck ) of the channel in the easy direction and when current is alternated , some of vortices are forced to move into the corner by the others and  freeze \" thus blocking the motion in the hard direction [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_high ] ] . due to",
    "the asymmetry in the radial direction and radially decreasing current density in the corbino setup , a vortex near the inner corner , which is closer to the center of the disk , moves faster than the one near the outer corner .",
    "therefore , at a specific value of the current [ e.g. , at @xmath42 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : trace_high](a ) ] , the vortex near the inner corner has a larger angular velocity . when the current increases , more and more vortices move along the circular trajectory and the distribution of vortices becomes strongly inhomogeneous [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_high](b ) ] . with further increasing current",
    ", this 2d trajectory becomes narrow and all the vortices move along the circle , i.e. , the 2d motion becomes 1d [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_high](c ) ] . with increasing density ,",
    "more and more vortices remain in the area near the corners of tcs and block other vortices moving in the hard direction . therefore , the maximum of vortex angular velocity increases . even in the descending - velocity region of the single - vortex regime",
    "[ see e.g. , when @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom](c ) ] , the angular velocity is still large .",
    "the maximum of the angular velocity @xmath38 for different vorticities @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom](d ) . in the single - vortex regime , where there is less than one vortex per tc",
    ", @xmath38 remains almost the same value because of the weak interaction between vortices .",
    "when @xmath34 becomes larger , there are more than one vortex per tc and the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction in the same tc makes the motion in either easy or hard directions much easier . therefore , @xmath38 first decreases when @xmath44 .",
    "however , for @xmath45 , the maximum @xmath38 starts to increase .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the transition from 1d motion to 2d motion . when vortices move along 2d trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_incom ] ) , the repulsive interaction between vortices still  helps \" a vortex to move to the next tc in the easy direction but blocks the vortex motion in the hard direction until applying a large enough driving current .",
    "the radial asymmetry facilitates the motion of vortices from inner / outer corners ( driven by stronger / weaker force ) one by one .",
    "this is different from the case of a linear ratchet channel where two vortices in the corners are driven by the same force and , as a result , arrive simultaneously at the neck region leading to jamming . in an asymmetric channel , the symmetry is broken , and jamming occurs only for rather large driving force .",
    "the dynamical behavior of vortices in the considered ratchet system is also strongly influenced by frequency of the ac current . in this subsection",
    "we study frequency dependence of the rectified vortex motion . for different frequencies @xmath32 ,",
    "the @xmath46 curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap ] .",
    "when the frequency is low , the dynamical behavior is similar for different vortex densities . as the drive amplitude @xmath47",
    "is increased , the angular velocity first increases , reaches a maximum , and then decreases to zero .",
    "the curves , especially for @xmath48 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](a ) are similar to the analytic result in a ratchet potential ( e.g. , see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of @xmath48 , the first critical value of current @xmath49 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](a ) ] corresponds to the maximum friction in the easy direction @xmath50 and the second one @xmath51 corresponds to the case when the driving force reaches the maximum friction in the hard direction @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath53 , the first critical value of current decreases to @xmath54 , which means vortices are easier to move in the easy direction",
    ". if the density increases further , @xmath54 decreases and @xmath55 increases , for @xmath41 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](a ) ]",
    ". therefore , the interaction between vortices allows vortices to move even easier in the easy direction and harder in the hard direction .    for an intermediate frequency [ e.g. , @xmath56 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](c ) ] , when the distance a vortex moves during one period is comparable to the size of a tc , the dynamical behavior of vortices will depend not only on the driving force but also on the vortex density .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the confinement force due to the boundary and the vortex - vortex interaction are also comparable . in this case",
    "we obtain different dynamical behavior in single - vortex and multi - vortex regimes which were discussed in the previous subsection . due to the commensurability between the numbers of tcs and vortices , a step structure of the @xmath46 curve",
    "is revealed in the low density case ( e.g. , @xmath48 and @xmath57 ) , which will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "as one can predict , the angular velocity becomes zero [ see fig . [",
    "fig : iw_gap](e ) ] when the frequency is high enough because a vortex oscillates near its initial position inside a cell and thus its motion can not be rectified .",
    "therefore , the variation of the angular velocity is much smaller than that in the low / intermediate frequency case .",
    "each vortex is localized in a specific tc , i.e. , the vortex is only influenced by a single potential well but not by the ratchet potential .    for comparison",
    ", we also calculate @xmath46 curves for the case when a tc has a wider connection part ( @xmath11 ) [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) ] .",
    "the function @xmath58 in general shows a similar behavior as for @xmath59 .",
    "however , for the intermediate frequency ( @xmath56 ) of the applied current , we obtain more steps in @xmath46 curve in the case of @xmath48 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](d ) ] than that for @xmath59 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_gap](c ) ] .",
    "this relates to the commensurability effect that will also be discussed in sec .",
    "as we defined above , the system contains @xmath34 vortices and @xmath4 triangles in a circular chain . if there is a common integer ( except one ) in terms of which",

    "the ascending part of the @xmath58 curves ( i.e. , where @xmath1 versus @xmath33 increases ) is stepwise .",
    "besides the large steps of angular velocity in the @xmath46 curve for @xmath48 , which we refer to as  integer steps \" , we also found smaller steps for some specific vorticities @xmath34 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_com ] ) . if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are incommensurate integers , the small steps can be found in the @xmath46 curves [ in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_com](b)-(d ) ] .",
    "when @xmath64 , we observe only integer steps of the angular velocity @xmath58 [ in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_com](a ) ] .",
    "the difference in the angular velocity between two adjacent steps is always @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath61 , then we can find a fractional step whose magnitude is @xmath66 .",
    "for example , for @xmath67 [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iw_com](b ) ] , the smallest step is @xmath68 in the system with 72 vortices ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , which is a half of that for @xmath64 ( e.g. , when @xmath70 ) . in the case of @xmath64 ,",

    "if one vortex can overcome the potential barrier and move in the easy direction , all the vortices can do so at the same time , i.e. , collectively .",
    "this results in integer steps of the average angular velocity @xmath65 in the @xmath46 curve .",
    "however , fractional steps appear when there are more than one vortex in each uc . for instance , a uc contains one tc with two vortices when @xmath69 , and if @xmath71 , the uc is constructed by three tcs with two vortices . in general case",

    "+    upon reaching the desired measurement temperature , the bias current was varied incrementally and the flux - flow voltage sensed by the squid was recorded for each current value .",
    "such current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) exhibited substantial asymmetries between the critical current for vortices to begin to move through the channel for the two directions .",
    "this asymmetry persisted down to the lowest measurement temperature , 1.60 k , well below the onset of superconductivity in the channel at @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp02 ] ) .",
    "the larger critical current corresponded to the sense of vortex motion in the hard direction through the ratchet cells . due to experimental wiring limitations on these preliminary measurements of a corbino ratchet channel",
    ", it was not possible to sweep the bias current with an oscillatory drive to study the average flux - flow voltage over a cycle .",
    "nonetheless , the large asymmetry between the two senses of critical current demonstrates the potential for a weak - pinning ratchet channel in a corbino geometry to rectify vortex motion .",
    "a vortex moving in an asymmetric circular channel in a corbino setup experiences the confinement of the boundary , the repulsive interaction due to other vortices and the gradient ( i.e. , radially decreasing ) driving force when an external current is applied .",
    "the combination of these factors determines the vortex motion .",
    "different dynamical behavior is observed in low and high density systems , which are referred to as  single - vortex \" and  multi - vortex \" regimes , respectively . for low density ,",
    "i.e. , in the single - vortex regime , there is no more than one vortex per triangular cell so that the vortex - vortex interaction is negligible",
    ". therefore , the ratchet potential due to the boundary dominates and all the vortices follow circular 1d trajectories . since all the vortices still move in 1d when there is more than one vortex per cell ( i.e. , a higher density ) , a vortex can escape even easier either in the easy or in the hard direction due to the interaction between vortices in the same cell .",
    "this results in decrease of the rectified net current .",
    "however , when the number of vortices increases further ( i.e. , in themulti - vortex \" regime of rectification when the rectified net current increases with the vortex density ) , the trajectories of vortex motion for low driving currents are 2d while these trajectories squeeze and turn to 1d circle with increasing driving current .",
    "because of the circular geometry of the channel , the density of vortices first becomes inhomogeneous [ i.e , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_high](b ) ] during the transition from 2d motion to 1d motion in the multi - vortex regime and then becomes homogeneous again when all the vortices move in a circular trajectory .",
    "considering the asymmetry in the radial direction , vortices near the inner / outer corner of the triangular cells ( tcs ) ( i.e. , closer / further to the center of the disk ) are driven by different lorentz forces and for some specific value of driving current the vortex in the outer corner moves to the inner corner while the one in the inner corner moves to the next tc [ e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_high](a ) ] .",
    "this kind of motion prevents vortices from arriving simultaneously at the narrow part that would lead to jamming which occurs in case of a linear channel . when the density increases , the maximum net angular velocity @xmath38 remains the same in the single - vortex regime and then decreases until reaching the multi - vortex regime , and then @xmath38 increases .",
    "the frequency of driving current also strongly influences the vortex dynamical behavior .",
    "the ac frequency determines the possible distance a vortex moves during an ac period . for high frequency ,",
    "a nearly zero net angular velocity is obtained for different values of driving current @xmath47 .",
    "each vortex is unable to overcome the energy barrier and is confined by a single potential well instead of the periodic ratchet potential .",
    "when the frequency is low , the ratchet effect is clearly observed in the @xmath46 curve but the commensurability effect is not present . for an intermediate frequency of driving current",
    "under which the distance of moving vortex in a period is comparable to the size of the tc , both the ratchet effect and the commensurability effect have been observed .    besides the vortex density and the frequency of current , the commensurability between the numbers of vortices and tcs also plays an important role in the dynamical behavior of vortices , which leads to jumps in the angular velocity @xmath1 with increasing driving current @xmath47 ( i.e. , steps in the @xmath46 curve ) .",
    "therefore , under some specific conditions , the average angular velocity of vortices is not a continuous function of the driving current .",
    "the commensurability also influences the minimum difference of the angular velocity for different steps in the @xmath46 curve , and results in integer steps ( i.e. , the large steps which are found , e.g. , for vorticity @xmath48 ) and fractional steps ( i.e. , the smaller steps whose magnitude are fractions of the magnitude of the integer steps , e.g. , for vorticity @xmath71 ) in a certain range of the current .",
    "we also obtained several peaks ( sharp jumps ) in the @xmath93 curve , which correspond to the principal period @xmath106 ( during which the vortex can move over one tc in the easy direction ) , and harmonics periods @xmath114 ( during which vortices move over @xmath62 tcs in the easy direction ) .",
    "the net flow of vortices is enhanced when the ac period is one of the harmonics periods , i.e. , the average angular velocity reaches a local maximum .",
