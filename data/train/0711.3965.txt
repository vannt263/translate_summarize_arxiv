    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has been shown to be a convenient environment to generate both schrdinger cat states@xcite and entangled coherent states@xcite in early days .",
    "recently , solano _ et .",
    "proposed a scheme to entangle two cavity modes through the interaction of the cavity modes with a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms inside the cavity@xcite . in their scheme ,",
    "the two cavity modes interact with the same atomic transition and will put some restrictions on these two cavity modes .    on the other hand , atomic coherence , which results from the coherent superposition of different quantum states , can lead to many novel phenomena .",
    "these include correlated spontaneous emission laser ( cel)@xcite , lasing without inversion@xcite and electromagnetically induced transparence@xcite _ etc._. it has been known that two cavity modes can be entangled when they interact with three - level atoms scully , agwarl and atomic coherence plays an essential role in this entanglement generation@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite showed that the two - mode macroscopically entangled continuous - variable state could be created in a cel system where the atomic coherence was induced by a classical driving field .",
    "ref.@xcite studied the interaction of a `` v''type three - level atom and two thermal modes of a doubly resonant cavity and showed that given a small amount of atomic coherence , entanglement could be generated between these two thermal modes even when they initially had arbitrarily high temperatures .",
    "however , the question whether an entangled coherent state of two cavity modes can be generated through the interaction with a single three - level atom has still not been answered there .",
    "most recently , our group have investigated that under large detuning condition , a `` @xmath1 '' three - level atom system interacting with two - mode field can entangle the two - mode field@xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the schemes van , mu is that the initial coherent state are demand , and the interaction time should be controled accurately otherwise we can not obtain entangled coherent state .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to generate a macroscopic entangled coherent state through the resonant interaction of two - mode field and a three level `` @xmath2 ''  ( or `` @xmath1 '' ) configuration atom .",
    "comparing this scheme with ref.@xcite , we do not need prepare the initial coherent state field state while the amplitude of entangled coherent state can be amplified , which means the system can work as a entanglement generator .",
    "also , we do not need to control the interaction time accurately .",
    "it just affect the amplitude of the entangled coherent state and have no effect on the entanglement .",

    "the difference between the state eq.([eq10 ] ) and eq.([eq2.4 ] ) mainly lies in the factor of @xmath80 except for the change of coherent amplitude @xmath81 . here",

    ", @xmath82 will achieve its asymptotic value zero so that the entanglement will be destroyed completely .",

    "not surprisingly the average photon number of the two - mode field will decrease with the increasing of @xmath99 .",
    "the concurrence increases first and then drops down to zero .",
    "the reason of concurrence dropping come from the factor @xmath82 . with time going , @xmath82 will be smaller and smaller so that entanglement is destroyed . therefore ,",
    "in our scheme , high - q doubly resonant cavity is preferred .",
    "we now briefly address the experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme .",
    "the required atomic level configuration can be achieved in rydberg atoms circular atomic level@xcite .",
    "the radiative lifetime is about @xmath100are much longer than those for noncircular rydberg states@xcite . even in free space",
    ", the atoms would propagate a few meters at thermal velocity before decaying .",
    "so , atomic radiative decay is thus negligible along the 20-cm path inside the apparatus ( in our model , we do not consider the atomic spontaneous decay , therefore circular level rydberg atom is a good choice ) . for circular rydberg atom , the coupling constant is @xmath101 , if the interacting time @xmath102 ( much smaller than the radiative lifetime @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 correspond to the maximum value in fig.2b , the coherent state @xmath105 ( for @xmath106 . considering the loss of the cavity,@xmath107 ( for @xmath108 .",

    "if the atomic lifetime is not long enough , one must include the decay of the excited atomic level . the analytic solution can not be obtained .",
    "one can numerically solve it .",
