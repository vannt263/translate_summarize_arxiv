    "discussions on the correctness of the experiment or models adequacy have not lead to an explanation of this discrepancy and do not exclude anomalies within the electron - muon universality .    in this experiment a pulsed high - intensity muon beam entering a hydrogen gas target will form muonic hydrogen atoms .",

    "the bremsstrahlung photons are the main source of background .",
    "nevertheless , the time distribution of the tail depicts correctly the muon life time inside the target .    due to the double gaussian pulse beam and due to the exponential decay of muonic atoms ,",
    "the shape of the tail can be analytically represented by the sum of two gaussian convoluted with exponential functions .",
    "the two gaussians represent the double pulse structure of the muon beam while the exponential lifetime parameter is the same for all the exponential functions . using this parametric representation it was possible to fit the ta il of the graphite target distribution in order to obtain the lifetime @xmath37 of the @xmath21c atom , which resulted to be @xmath38 ns .",
    "this result is in agreement with the expected value of @xmath39 from reference @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : t_c2 ]    ) in the same time region.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    shows a close up of the result of the fit in the time range soon after the second pulse ( top panel ) .",

    "the bottom panel shows that the extrapolation of the fit in the excluded region is in a good agreement with data .",
    "the next step was the analysis of the time distribution obtained using the pure h@xmath5 target . in this case",
    "the overall behaviour is similar to the graphite target but two type of exponential functions are expected : muons interact and stops within both the aluminum container and the gas target .",
    "considering the double pulse , this means that the analytical representation of the distribution is made of four gaussian convolution of exponentials with two different lifetimes , one representing the @xmath21al and one representing the @xmath21p atom decays . by fitting the time distribution a resulting value for the @xmath21al atoms of @xmath40 ns and value for the @xmath21p atoms",
    "@xmath41 ns were obtained , in agreement with expected values from reference @xcite . in the case of the h@xmath5 + 4% co@xmath5 target",
    ", two new exponential functions must be added in comparison to the h@xmath5 target analytical description of the time distribution tail .",
    "these exponentials represent the @xmath21c and @xmath21o decay time . in this case , only absolute normalizations and the decay rate for oxygen where left free in the fitting procedure , while the life times of already measured atoms were fixed .",
    "the fit was performed as before by excluding the time region from 610 to 2500 ns and by assuming that the tail of the second pulse is exclusively made of prompt events .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_h2co2tot ] ,        where the measured life time for the @xmath21o atoms was @xmath42 ns , compatible with previous measurements @xcite . however , the more important result of the fit concerns the normalization of the gaussian convoluted exponential functions for the various atoms : the contribution to the tail of the @xmath21p decay resulted negligible and compatible with zero , while the @xmath21o and @xmath21c normalization factors resulted to be @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the fact that the tail of the time distribution is well represented ( the fit converges with @xmath45 ) by @xmath21o and @xmath21c only with a ratio compatible with the true atomic concentration of the two elements is a strong indication that the @xmath21p atoms transfer very quickly the muons to the higher charge nuclei .    ) in the same time region .",
    "a highly significant deviation of data from the fit due to muon transfer from @xmath21p to oxygen and carbon can be noticed.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    moreover , by comparing the resulting fit to the data in the region close to the second pulse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t_h2co2 ] ) and also by assuming that the pulse rise is completely due to prompt emission , a very significant deviation ( up to twelve sigmas ) from the pure @xmath21o and @xmath21c fit emerges .",
    "this is the tail of the muonic oxygen x - rays emitted when the @xmath21p atoms transfer the muon to the oxygen and carbon nuclei .",
    "the same effect can be seen also after the first pulse ( not shown in figure ) .",
    "a similar situation was found with the argon target . from the fit of the time distribution tail a value of @xmath46 ns",
    "was measured as @xmath21ar life time , again in agreement with previous measurements @xcite .    from a study of the time evolution of the x - ray events within the oxygen ( argon )",
    "peak it will be possible to determine the muon transfer rate from hydrogen to oxygen ( argon ) .",
    "the results of this analysis will be published in a following paper .",
    "the riken - ral double pulsed muon beam has been proved to be an excellent source for the famu experiment .",
    "the first test performed by the famu collaboration confirmed that it was possible to setup an excellent apparatus made of a extremely pure gas target , a beam hodoscope and a high resolution x - rays detectors .",
