    "the experimental portion of this work was conducted at the university of north carolina at chapel hill , in the facilities of the joint applied math and marine science fluids lab . video imaging was used as the primary diagnostic technique to examine the leaf orientation in air moving at speeds of 1 - 10 meters per second in an open wind tunnel as described by vogel [ 3 ] .",
    "leaves shown in the video include the wild ginger , _ hexastylis arifolia _ , the tulip popular , _ _ , and the maple , _ _ .    numerical simulations of the fully - coupled fluid - structure interaction problem were performed using a distributed - memory parallel implementation of the immersed boundary method with support for cartesian grid adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) [ 1 ] .",
    "all simulations were performed at a reynolds number of 250 , and the dimensionless force generated as well as the reconfiguration shapes are similar to what occurs for the high reynolds number flows relevant to broad leaves . more details of these simulations can be found in miller _",
