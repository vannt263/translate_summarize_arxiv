    "pulsation frequencies and modes are potentially useful tools with which to study the interior structure of the giant planets",
    ". three types of modes are distinguished : g - modes are standing internal gravity waves , p - modes are standing acoustic waves , and f - modes are of intermediate frequency and can be regarded as the fundamental mode of either the p- or the g - modes .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are characterized by their radial order @xmath2 and degree @xmath1 .",
    "the surface movements associated with such pulsations are hard to detect and , as of july 2012 , only jupiter s global velocity oscillations have been observed . the work of @xcite",
    ", @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite resulted in a putative measurement of the mean frequency spacing of 142 @xmath10 3 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite claims to have detected jupiter s global modes with a mean noise level five times lower than previously achieved , using observations acquired in 2005 by the sympa fourier spectro - imager of the teide laboratory .",
    "their upper troposphere radial velocities are determined by measurements of the doppler shifts of solar mg lines ( 517 nm ) reflected by jupiter s clouds .",
    "the resulting velocity maps were decomposed into spherical harmonics to create a set of time series whose power was computed with a discrete fourier transform .",
    "it exhibited excess power between 800 and 2000 hz and a secondary excess between 2400 and 3400 hz , with a frequency of maximum amplitude of 1213 @xmath10 50 @xmath11 , a mean spacing of 155.3 @xmath10 2.2 @xmath11 and a mode maximum amplitude of @xmath12 .",
    "these measurements agree with theoretical expectations in terms of the frequency range , the amplitude , and the mean large spacing @xcite and correspond to the signature of p - modes .",
    "several theoretical works intended to bring out possible forcing mechanisms capable of exciting pulsation modes in nearby gaseous planets to magnitudes accessible to observation .",
    "current studies tend to struggle to find significant theoretical amplitudes , but the crucial point is that giant exoplanets may exhibit more favorable conditions for these mechanisms , which may bring about higher oscillation amplitudes .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite evaluated the possibility of a coupling of acoustic oscillations to turbulent convection on jupiter and saturn , as is the case for the sun @xcite . with this kind of coupling ,",
    "the physical amplitudes of the modes may scale like @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the interior luminosity , @xmath15 is the mach number , and @xmath16 is a power that depends on whether the sound generated is via dipole ( @xmath17 ) or quadrupole ( @xmath18 ) emission @xcite .",
    "giant exoplanets will be almost fully convective , and their internal luminosities are likely to be 10 to 100 times larger than that of jupiter @xcite .",
    "since the mach number is also likely to be higher , the amplitudes of acoustic oscillations of giant exoplanets may exceed those of jupiter by a large factor .",
    "moreover , close encounters of planets in an evolving planetary system may promote planet - planet or moon - planet interactions which can excite tides dynamically through the transfer of orbital energy , as pointed out in the stellar case by @xcite and in the moon case by @xcite .",
    "if the encounters are close enough , then the resultant amplitudes may be significant .",
    "given current technological limitations to the observation of giant planet s oscillations , it is reasonable to think that the global oscillations of giant exoplanets will not be detected in the foreseeable future .",
    "however , specific environnments of giant planets outside the solar system may foster excitation mechanisms more vigorous than in the jovian or saturnian cases and , thus , lead to significant pulsation amplitudes .",
    "hence , a theoretical exploration of the systematics of the pulsation frequencies for the broad spectrum of recently discovered giant exoplanets might stimulate observers to design methods to detect giant planet oscillations , since such oscillations are so diagnostic of structure .    in this spirit",
    ", we calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the pulsationnal modes of giant exoplanets .",
    "we quantify the dependence of the modal eigenfrequencies on the planet mass and radius .",
    "in addition , we focus on the influence of a dense core on these quantities , since its presence has already been suggested in specific extrasolar giant planets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we calculate corresponding models for jupiter and saturn themselves , and compare them with previous work .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite added rotation , differential rotation , and ellipticity to their initial spherically - symmetric , nonrotating jovian models .",
    "the influence of the troposphere on the high - frequency oscillations was first adressed by @xcite , then in detail by @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed an asymptotic method to determine the eigenfrequencies which included the discontinuity of a jovian core .",
    "they introduced the mean spacing or characteristic frequency @xmath0 , defined by : @xmath19^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath20 is the speed of sound , and emphasized the sensitivity of the jovian oscillation spectrum to the presence of a dense core . since then",
    ", the jovian characteristic frequency has been estimated to be between 152 and 160 @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the recent observations of @xcite .",
    "saturn s oscillations have also been studied theoretically .",
    "@xcite suggested that the f - modes of saturn are the most likely to be detected through their potential influence on that planet s rings . using the techniques applied to jupiter , @xcite calculated the eigenfrequencies of the lowest - order p - modes of saturn , along with their characteristic frequencies .",
    "the latter were found to be between 106 and 109 @xmath11 .    throughout our paper",
    ", we do not take into account the effects of rotation or oblateness @xcite .",
    "since the adiabatic approximation is appropriate for jovian planets @xcite , adiabaticity is here assumed for jupiter , saturn , and the entire set of exoplanets . finally ,",
    "since we focus on the giant exoplanet regime , we select the appropriate range of measured giant planet radii @xcite : @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the lowest - degree p - modes are the most likely to be detected .",
    "@xcite and @xcite take the degree @xmath22 to be an upper limit and the jovian observations of @xcite are within the frequency regions [ 0.8 , 2.1 ] @xmath23 and [ 2.4 , 3.4 ] @xmath23 . in the specific case of jupiter , and for @xmath24 $ ] , these values loosely correspond to the ranges of radial order @xmath25 $ ] and [ 15,20 ] , respectively .",
    "these observationnal windows are consistent with the theoretical value of the atmospheric cutoff frequency of jovian modes estimade by @xcite and which is about 3 mhz .",
    "theoretically , the asymptotic trends are manifest for @xmath26 or 5 @xcite .",
    "thus , we focus on the p - modes and f - modes of low degree ( @xmath27 ) and relatively low radial order ( @xmath28 ) .    in  2",
    ", we summarize the theory of adiabatic nonradial oscillations of nonrotating spherical planetary models .",
    "we present our numerical technique , closely based on the work of @xcite and @xcite . to test the validity and precision of our code",
    ", we calculate the eigenfrequencies of f - modes , p - modes and g - modes of well - studied polytrope models and compare our results to those of @xcite .    in  3 , we describe the giant planet models used in the article .",
    "we present our results in the case of jupiter and saturn , and compare them to both observationnal data @xcite and theoretical work @xcite .",
    "we briefly focus on the dependence of the jovian modal oscillations on the core mass of jupiter and present the derivatives of the low - degree acoustic modes eigenfrequencies with respect to the core mass .    in  4 , we focus on the giant exoplanets",
    ". we present our results in terms of the characteristic frequency @xmath0 , the eigenfrequencies of low - degree f - modes , and the eigenfrequencies of low - degree p - modes across the giant exoplanet continuum . in separate subsections",
    ", we investigate their dependence on the planet mass , planet radius , and core mass .",
    "we also focus on the influence of a high fraction of heavy elements in the envelope , by using a high helium mass fraction , @xmath29 , as an approximate substitute @xcite .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the temporal evolution of the charateristic frequency @xmath0 for simple planetary models considered in isolation .",
    "we considered non - rotating , spherically - symmetrical planetary models . for adiabatic , nonradial oscillations of such objects , it follows from @xcite that the radial part of the displacement @xmath30 , the eulerian perturbations of the pressure @xmath31 , and the eulerian perturbation of the gravitational potential @xmath32 take the form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the spherical harmonics of azimuthal order @xmath35 and degree @xmath1 , and @xmath36 is either @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 .",
    "a given oscillation mode is , thus , described by its azimuthal order @xmath35 , degree @xmath1 , radial order @xmath2 .",
    "these variables are govern by a set of differential equations and four boundary conditions , two at the surface , and two at the center @xcite .",
    "the corresponding set of equations is given in the first section of the appendix .",
    "since the azimuthal order @xmath35 does not appear in the governing equations , the eigenfrequencies are ( 2@xmath1 + 1)-fold degenerate , and are fully described by their degree @xmath1 and radial order @xmath2 .",
    "this problem has to be numerically implemented to calculate the corresponding eigenfrequency @xmath37 for a given mode .",
    "we detail the technique used in this paper in the appendix , but summarize our overall methodology in the next subsections .",
    "several numerical techniques have been previously introduced @xcite .",
    "they are divided into shooting techniques and relaxation methods . in the shooting technique ,",
    "solutions satisfying the boundary conditions are integrated separately from the inner and outer boundaries , and the eigenvalue is found by matching these solutions at an arbitrary interior fitting point .",
    "the second technique is to solve the equations together with the normalization condition , and all but one of the boundary conditions , using a relaxation technique ; the eigenvalue is then found by requiring that the remaining boundary condition be satisfied .",
    "the shooting methods are generally considerably faster than the relaxation techniques , but their precision decreases as the degree @xmath1 increases @xcite . however , since we consider only low - degree modes , a shooting method is quite suitable for our problem .",
    "dimensionless variables are introduced ( see the second section of the appendix ) . in particular , the dimensionless frequency @xmath38 is defined by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angular frequency of the modes , @xmath41 is the corresponding frequency , @xmath42 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath43 and @xmath15 are the radius and the mass of the studied object , respectively .",
    "solutions are obtained by integration using a fifth - order runge - kutta technique . to calculate the eigenfrequencies in a given frequency range",
    ", we use a determinant method developed in @xcite and fully described in the third section of the appendix .",
    "two linearly independent solutions are calculated from the center , and two from the surface .",
    "they are connected at an arbitrary inner boundary .",
    "the eigenvalues do not depend on its position .      as we calculate the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the acoustic modes for a given degree @xmath1",
    ", we determine their order @xmath2 using the following equation @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are dimensionless variables defined by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the density and @xmath49 is the gravitational acceleration .    in the definition of @xmath2 ,",
    "the sum is over the zeros @xmath50 in @xmath45 ( excluding the center ) , where @xmath51 is the relative radius .",
    "the value of @xmath52 depends on the behavior of the solution close to the innermost boundary .",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 have the same sign at the innermost mesh point , excluding the center , @xmath53",
    ". otherwise @xmath54 . in particular , for a complete model that includes the center , as in our case , it follows from the boundary conditions at the center that @xmath54 for radial oscillations and @xmath53 for non - radial oscillations . with these conventions ,",
    "the order of the f - mode is @xmath55 .      in order to test the code ,",
    "we compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of polytropic models . to compare our results with the work of @xcite",
    ", we take the same radius and mass for our calculations : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the eigenfrequencies of f - modes , g - modes , and p - modes are given in tables [ pmodes1 ] , [ pmodes2 ] and [ gmodes ] , in @xmath11 .",
    "our frequencies match those of @xcite to a precision of @xmath58 or better , for all types of modes , for @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "this gives us confidence in our calculational method as we approach more complex models .",
    "the giant planet models we use for the calculations for jupiter and saturn consist of an adiabatic atmosphere , a hydrogen - helium envelope , and an olivine core .",
    "when a core is included , we explore @xmath61 @xmath62 for jupiter and @xmath63 @xmath62 for saturn .",
    "both ranges are marginally consistent with the core accretion formation models for these planets , which suggest @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen / helium equation of state that we use for this study is described in @xcite .",
    "the transition between the atmosphere and the envelope has been smoothed to ensure the continuity of density , pressure , and sound speed .    we build several models for both jupiter and saturn , using different core masses and helium fractions in the envelope .",
    "table [ parameters ] presents various parameters of these models : the helium mass fraction inside the envelope , @xmath29 , the mass of the core , @xmath65 ( in earth units ) , the central pressure @xmath66 ( in mbars ) , the central density @xmath67 ( in cgs units ) , and the characteristic frequency @xmath0 ( in @xmath11 ) , defined in @xcite using the following equation : @xmath68^{-1 } \\ , \\label{nu0}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the sound speed in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "figure [ f1 ] portrays the profiles of the density , @xmath48 , the gravitational acceleration , @xmath49 , and the sound speed , @xmath20 , for models j4 and s2 , defined in table [ parameters ] . both density and sound speed are discontinuous at the core interface . in the case of jupiter",
    ", for the models defined in table [ parameters ] , the calculated characteristic frequencies , @xmath0 , are consistent with the observational value measured by @xcite : @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath11 ( see also figure [ f6 ] ) .",
    "figure [ f2 ] depicts the eigenfrequencies of models s2 and j4 for @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath2 up to 25 .",
    "these results are given in the form of chelle diagrams based on the results of the asymptotic theory for low - degree oscillations developed in , for example , @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts that , for low degree @xmath1 and large radial order @xmath2 , the eigenfrequencies @xmath37 of p - modes are , to a first approximation , proportionnal to the characteristic frequency , @xmath0 : @xmath72 an chelle diagram presents the ratio @xmath73 as a function of the difference @xmath74)$ ] , where @xmath75 is the floor function .",
    "thus , it allows us to see the deviation from the approximate value .",
    "both panels of figure [ f2 ] are in qualitative agreement with previous numerical results for jupiter ( * ? ? ?",

    "the jovian periods of the acoustic fundamental tone and overtones with radial order and degree up to 5 are given in table [ pmodesjupiter ] for the model j4 .",
    "though the differences between our models and those derived by @xcite prevent us from a precise comparison , it is clear that we find similar results to this previous work ( see their table 2 ) .",
    "figure [ f3 ] portrays the radial component of the eigendisplacement @xmath30 for low - degree , lowest - order modal oscillations of the model j4 of jupiter , as a function of the relative radius @xmath51 .",
    "the radial displacement is shown for @xmath76 , 1 , 2 , and 5 .",
    "it is taken equal to 1 m at the surface , for every mode .",
    "the behavior of the modes near the center is determined by the boundary conditions of the specific numerical problem considered here @xcite , which lead to the following relations , for @xmath77 : @xmath78 thus , for @xmath79 , the radial displacement does not necessary vanish near the center . in figure",
    "[ f3 ] , for the lowest degrees @xmath1 , the presence of the dense core is directly visible at the boundary with the envelope ( @xmath80 , for this model ) . for higher degree ( here , @xmath81 ) , the influence of the core is less obvious in the radial eigenfunctions , because the amplitude of the radial displacement vanishes near the center , for every radial order @xmath2 .",
    "the influence of the size of the core on the frequency spectrum of jupiter has already been studied @xcite . however , no determination of the derivative of the eigenfrequencies with respect to the core mass has yet been provided .",
    "focusing on the f - modes and p - modes of jupiter , we calculate their eigenfrequencies for various core masses , with the helium mass fraction fixed at @xmath82 in the envelope .",
    "an chelle diagram of the eigenfrequencies of jupiter for @xmath83 and for a few core masses is given in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "the spectra are very well separated for radial order @xmath26 , which indicates , as mentionned by @xcite and @xcite , that the high - frequency acoustic oscillations of low degree @xmath1 can be very useful in determining the structure and size of the core .",
    "we highlight the sensitivity to the core mass of the eigenfrequencies of low - degree acoustic oscillations .",
    "figure [ f5 ] shows the eigenfrequencies of such modes for jupiter as a function of the mass of the core , @xmath84 , for @xmath85 $ ] and for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for every radial order @xmath2 ,",
    "the eigenfrequencies have been normalized by their coreless value : @xmath90 this normalization allows us to compare the deviation of the frequencies from their coreless values as the core mass increases , regardless of their absolute value , which depends of the radial order @xmath2 .    for @xmath76 ,",
    "as @xmath2 increases the frequency becomes less sensitive to the size of the core .",
    "the normalized frequency @xmath91 is by far the most affected by the variation of the core mass ; its value decreases by more than 14% between the coreless version of jupiter and the model with a @xmath92- earth mass core . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the trend is very different ; the derivative of the normalized frequency with respect to the core mass decreases from positive to negative values as @xmath2 increases . as a result ,",
    "this derivative approximately vanishes for specific frequencies , for example @xmath94 ( fig.[f5 ] , top right ) , @xmath95 ( fig.[f5 ] , bottom left ) , and @xmath96 ( fig.[f5 ] , bottom right ) .",
    "all these frequencies vary by less than 0.5% over a core mass range from 0 to 10 @xmath62 . for higher radial order ,",
    "the influence of the core mass is more important ; for example , @xmath97 varies by more than 3.0% over the core mass range from 0 to 10 @xmath62 .",
    "this increased sensitivity is consistent with the previous discussion concerning the chelle diagram .",
    "the f - mode is also sensitive to the core mass , with a variation up to 3.8% with core mass from 0 to 10 @xmath62 , for @xmath98 and 3 .",
    "these variations may be surprising compared to the stellar case , where the f - modes are constrained to shallow depths , far away from the influence of the core .",
    "however , this phenomenon has already been pointed out by @xcite in the saturnian case . on the other hand ,",
    "planetary f - modes are also likely to decay with depth and , as the degree @xmath1 increases , the oscillation moves to the surface of the planet and its frequency is determined by the outer layers @xcite .",
    "calculations for higher degrees @xmath1 may thus exhibit a reduction of the influence of the core mass on the frequencies of the f - modes . we conclude , however , that for the low - degree nonradial oscillations the sensitivity of the pulsation frequencies to the core mass is important both for the f - modes and for the high - radial order p - modes",
    ". however , for some specific intermediate values of radial order @xmath2 , the sensitivity nearly vanishes over the whole core mass range .",
    "if detected , these particular modes would provide little evidence of the presence of a core .",
    "for a systematic look at the exoplanets currently known , we use the catalog developed by @xcite and available at the url _",
    "http://www.exoplanet.eu_. as of the @xmath99 of july , 2012 , @xmath100 confirmed planets are listed in this catalog .",
    "we limit our study to the planets whose radius and mass have both been estimated .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the giant exoplanet regime and , therefore , we select the planets whose radii are within the range @xmath21 . in terms of mass ,",
    "most of the detected giant exoplanets have masses less than 5 @xmath4 , but the distribution has a long tail towards masses larger than 10 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "88% of the selected exoplanets have masses less than or equal to 5 @xmath4 , and 94% have masses less than or equal to 10 @xmath4 . in the 10 to 20 @xmath4 interval , it is difficult to fix a clear upper limit for giant exoplanets masses , because the planet population and the brown dwarf population overlap @xcite . therefore , though we restrict the mass range studied , we are aware of the ambiguous status of the heaviest objects .",
    "this final set is composed of @xmath101 exoplanets .",
    "we calculate the characteristic frequency @xmath0 for each object of this group , using the techniques and models developed and described in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the helium mass fraction is fixed at 0.25 in the entire envelope and no core is added .",
    "the results are shown in table [ nu0exoplanets1 ] , with the planets sorted from low to high mass .",
    "for the selected objects , the characteristic frequency range is @xmath102 . around 1 @xmath4 , @xmath0 is smaller than jupiter s value for almost every object , since their radii are larger than 1 @xmath7 .",
    "the spread of values is dramatic around every mass within the range [ 0.17 @xmath4 , 30 @xmath4 ] , which emphasizes the strong sensitivity of @xmath0 to planet parameters .    to investigate the crossed dependence of @xmath0 on the radius and the planet mass",
    ", we calculate it for a wide range of radii and masses in the observed giant planet regime .",
    "figure [ f6 ] portrays the corresponding results for 0.5 @xmath104 @xmath6 @xmath104 10 @xmath4 , and 0.95 @xmath104 @xmath9 @xmath104 2.1 @xmath7 .",

    "we place the observed point for jupiter , taken from @xcite , at @xmath107 @xmath4 .",
    "as can be seen , our model is consistent with the observational data . for any fixed value of the planet radius ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 is an increasing function of the planet mass @xmath6 .",
    "however , the sensitivity of @xmath0 to the planet mass decreases as the planet radius increases .",
    "in order to quantify this , we fit the curves of figure [ f6 ] with straight lines , in the high - mass regime ( 5 @xmath104 @xmath6 @xmath104 10 @xmath4 ) , and calculate their derivatives .",
    "we find that , for a radius equal to 0.95 @xmath7 , the corresponding derivative is 25 @xmath11 @xmath108 . at the extreme opposite end of the giant planet radius spectrum , for a radius equal to 2.1 @xmath7 ,",
    "the corresponding derivative is 8.0 @xmath11 @xmath108 .",
    "these conclusions are qualitatively consistent with the presumption that @xmath0 would scale approximately with the square root of the mean density of the planet @xcite .",
    "thus , the asymptotic scaling relations between jupiter and giant exoplanets would be roughly : @xmath109 where @xmath110 refers to the mean frequency spacing of jupiter . as we show in  [ mass ] and  [ 42 ] , this expression only approximately holds .",
    "below , we investigate the separate influence of the radius , the mass , and the core mass on giant exoplanet pulsation modes .",
    "we focus on one parameter at a time .",
    "we select three specific quantities to discuss this influence : the characteristic frequency @xmath0 , the eigenfrequencies of low - degree f - modes , and the eigenfrequencies of low - degree p - modes . to determine the influence of planetary parameters on the characteristic frequency and on the frequency spectrum of exoplanets , we calculate these for a wide range of each parameter ( radius , mass , entropy , and core mass ) , all other things being equal .",

    "when the radius is fixed at 1.0 @xmath7 , @xmath0 is an increasing function of planet mass .",

    "this statement is true for every value of the planet mass @xmath6 in the selected range . on the bottom right panel ( @xmath22 ) , the functions @xmath128 have been added ( black dashed line ) .",
    "thus , the frequency range of the calculated modes is contained between the black dashed line ( @xmath121 ) and the solid gold line , defined by ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "numerically , the low - degree , low - order eigenfrequencies of a 1.0-@xmath4 planet are in the range [ 0.11,1.8 ] @xmath23 , whereas the same eigenfrequencies of a 15-@xmath4 object are in the range [ 0.50 , 6.4 ] @xmath23 .",
    "we build several planetary models with the mass fixed at @xmath130 @xmath4 and with various radii .",
    "table [ parametersradius ] presents various parameters of these models : the planet radius , @xmath9 ( in jupiter units ) , the central pressure , @xmath66 ( in mbars ) , the central density , @xmath67 ( in cgs units ) , the specific entropy , @xmath112 ( in @xmath113 ) , and the characteristic frequency , @xmath0 ( in @xmath11 ) .",
    "when the mass is fixed at 1.0 @xmath4 , @xmath0 is a decreasing function of the planet radius .",
    "we again fit this function with a power law and obtain : @xmath131 we find here a dependence on the radius slightly stronger than the one suggested by the asymptotic scaling relation of eq .",
    "[ nu0j ] , though one has to keep in mind the discrepancy between the complexity of the interior models and the roughness of the relation exhibited in equation [ nu0j ] .",
    "if we compare equations [ nu0mp ] and [ nu0rp ] , we see that , for the selected ranges of values , the dependence of @xmath0 on the radius is significantly more important than the dependence on the mass . as explained in the previous subsection , @xmath0 is approximately the frequency gap between two modes of consecutive radial order , for a given low value of the degree @xmath1 , and for large radial order @xmath2 .",
    "thus , this decreasing behavior results in a diminution of the frequency gap between high - frequency modes .",
    "numerically , we can see that this gap is around @xmath132 @xmath11 for a @xmath133-@xmath7 planet ( again , the mass is equal to @xmath134 @xmath4 ) , which is less than 26% of the jovian value .",
    "we calculate the eigenfrequencies of the lowest - order p - modes for the objects defined in table [ parametersradius ] , and for @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "figure [ f10 ] presents the corresponding eigenvalues for @xmath2 up to 12 , as a function of the degree @xmath1 , for objects with a radius equal to 1.0 , 1.2 , 1.4 and 1.6 @xmath7 , and a mass equal to 1.0 @xmath4 .",
    "it appears that the remarks of the previous subsection , which deals with the dependence on the planet mass , also apply to figure [ f10 ] .",
    "indeed , the frequency spectra of the four planet models appear more and more distinct from one another as we go up in frequency , and as we go up in degree @xmath1 .",
    "the frequency range and scale of the low - degree , low - order eigenvalues decrease with the planet radius , when the mass is fixed , whereas the same parameters increase with the planet mass , when the radius is fixed .",
    "for instance , numerically , the low - degree , low - order eigenvalues of a 1.6-@xmath7 planet are between 0.07 @xmath23 and 0.91 @xmath23 , whereas , in the case of a 1.0-@xmath7 planet , the same modes have eigenfrequencies between 0.1 @xmath23 and 2.6 @xmath23 .      even in the cases of jupiter and saturn ,",
    "the presence and mass of a dense core is still not proven .",
    "@xcite have shown that measurements of the pulsation modes of jupiter could constrain the dimensions of the core .",
    "this is likely to be true for exoplanets , if and when their modes are measured .",
    "many extrasolar giant planets appear smaller than the theory would allow @xcite .",
    "this anomaly can be explained by the presence of heavy elements in a dense core , which shrinks the radii of these planets .",
    "one famous example is the case of hd149026b , whose measured radius and mass suggest the presence of a core mass in the range 45 - 90 @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "we calculate the characteristic frequency @xmath0 as a function of the core mass for a selection of exoplanets for which the presence of a core has been inferred .",
    "the results are given in figure [ f11 ] , which also includes the characteristic frequencies for jupiter and saturn , as a reference .",
    "the core mass ranges have been taken from @xcite for jupiter and saturn , @xcite for hd149026b and @xcite for the other planets .",
    "it is clear that , in any case , with the radius and the mass of the object fixed , @xmath0 is a decreasing function of the core mass .",
    "this can be easily explained : the presence of a dense core reduces the sound speed in the center of the planet ( see , for example , figure [ f1 ] ) which ultimately increases the integral @xmath135 and , thus , diminishes @xmath0 , which is inversely proportionnal to the latter .",
    "however , the sensitivity to the mass of the core is not identical among the selected objects .",
    "we can see that saturn and hd149026b are much more influenced by the core mass than the others .",
    "this is due to their small radius and mass , compared to the other selected planets . indeed ,",
    "saturn s radius is @xmath136 @xmath7 , its mass is @xmath137 @xmath4 , hd149026b s radius is @xmath138 @xmath7 , its mass is @xmath139 @xmath4 whereas all the other planets have radii within the range [ 1.0,1.23 ] @xmath7 and masses within the range [ 0.54,1.30 ] @xmath4 . in this way , for planets with a small radius and mass , the determination of @xmath0 through observation can be a powerful tool to investigate the presence of a dense core .",
    "for example , for our models of hd149026b , @xmath0 loses more than 26% of its value between a 45-@xmath62 core model and a 90-@xmath62 core model .",
    "thus , even a rough estimate of the value of @xmath0 might give us information on the core of this type of planet .    to investigate the dependence of the low - degree , low - order eigenfrequencies on the core mass , we build several exoplanet models with the radius fixed at @xmath111 @xmath7 , the mass fixed at @xmath130 @xmath4 , and the core mass in the range 0 - 100 @xmath62 .",
    "table [ parameterscore1 ] presents the various parameters of these models : the core mass , @xmath84 ( in earth units ) , the central pressure , @xmath66 ( in mbars ) , the central density , @xmath67 ( in cgs units ) , the specific entropy , @xmath112 ( in @xmath113 ) , and the characteristic frequency , @xmath0 ( in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the lowest - order eigenvalues of modal oscillations are given in figure [ f12 ] , as a function of the degree @xmath1 , for models with a core mass equal to 0 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , and 100 @xmath62 , and with the radius and mass fixed at the jovian values .",
    "when the radius and mass are fixed , the eigenfrequencies are monotonic functions of the core mass , but their direction of variation depends on their degree @xmath1 and their radial order @xmath2 . for @xmath140 , the eigenvalues of the f - modes slowly increase when the core mass increases . at high @xmath2 , for every @xmath1 , it can be seen that the eigenfrequencies are decreasing functions of the core mass , all things being equal .",
    "for instance , numerically , between the coreless model and the model with a core mass fixed at 100 @xmath62 , the eigenvalues decrease by @xmath118@xmath141% at high @xmath2 ( @xmath142 $ ] ) , for every @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "thus , for a given degree @xmath1 , the f - modes and the high - order p - modes , as functions of the core mass , have opposite directions of variation .",
    "consequently , the frequency range for a given @xmath1 shrinks when the core mass increases .",
    "if the low - degree , low - order modes were to be unambiguously identified by its spherical harmonic quantum numbers , the corresponding frequency range may constrain the presence of heavy elements in the deep interior .",
    "we have also constructed several exoplanet models with the mass fixed at @xmath130 @xmath4 , and the specific entropy fixed at @xmath143 @xmath113 , which is the specific entropy of our coreless model with @xmath111 @xmath7 and @xmath130 @xmath4 .",
    "these models possess a core with a mass in the range 0 - 100 @xmath62 and this set of planet models approximately probes the situation in which , for a given planet mass and a given age , the presence of a dense core shrinks the radius . table [ parameterscore2 ] presents various parameters of these models : the core mass , @xmath84 ( in earth units ) , the planet radius , @xmath9 ( in jupiter units ) , the central pressure , @xmath66 ( in mbars ) , the central density , @xmath67 ( in cgs units ) , and the characteristic frequency , @xmath0 ( in @xmath11 ) .",
    "for the selected values of planet mass ( @xmath130 @xmath4 ) and entropy ( @xmath143 @xmath113 ) , the shrinking of the radius with core mass is visible .",
    "for instance , the planet radius decreases by @xmath118@xmath144 % when a 100-@xmath62 core is added .",
    "the direct consequence of the reduction of the radius is the increase of the characteristic frequency @xmath0 .",
    "qualitatively , the increase of @xmath0 is consistent with its dependence on the planet radius , discussed in section [ 42 ] .",
    "for the fixed radius and entropy , the eigenvalues of the lowest - order modal oscillations are given in figure [ f12 ] , as a function of the degree @xmath1 , for models with a core mass equal to 0 , 10 , 20 , 50 , and 100 @xmath62 . when the mass and the entropy of the planet models are fixed , the frequency range of the low - degree , low - order p - modes decreases as the core mass increases .",
    "this is again a direct consequence of the shrinking of the planet radius as the core mass goes up , for given mass and entropy .",
    "however , as can be seen , the frequency spectra of the models defined by @xmath145 @xmath62 and @xmath146 @xmath62 are quite similar for @xmath59 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] . in particular , for @xmath79 and @xmath88 , the eigenfrequencies of these two models differ by less than 1% for the frequency range considered",
    ". these similarities may be due to two opposite effects .",
    "first , we know that the presence of a 10-@xmath62 dense core shrinks the model radius by 2% for the selected values of planet mass and entropy ( see table [ parameterscore2 ] ) .",
    "when the planet mass is fixed , this decrease of the radius causes an increase of the low - degree , low - order eigenvalues , as already discussed in section [ 42 ] . on the other hand , when the planet radius and the planet mass are both fixed , the presence of a dense core implies a decrease of the same eigenvalues .",
    "figure [ f12 ] shows that , for the selected values , for low core mass and low degree @xmath1 , the presence of a dense core compensates for the effect of the radius reduction on the eigenvalues .",
    "nonetheless , it can be seen that , for higher degrees @xmath1 ( @xmath147 ) and for higher core masses ( @xmath148 @xmath62 ) , the effects of the radius reduction exceed the pure effect of the core .",
    "if not contained in a dense core , heavy elements can be laced throughout the envelope @xcite . in this spirit , we investigate the influence of heavy elements in the envelope itself , regardless of the presence of a core . though there is no published robust equation of state that properly includes heavy elements beyond helium , we can mimic their presence by using a higher helium mass fraction than @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "we assume the excess of helium mass fraction @xmath150 ( compared with the default value @xmath151 ) is given by the value of the metallicity @xmath152 : @xmath153 using the value from @xcite , we take @xmath154 , to be the heavy element mass fraction in the sun . in this way , an helium fraction of @xmath155 mimics a metallicity equal to @xmath118@xmath156 @xmath157 solar metallicity .",
    "we build three coreless models of exoplanets with a helium mass fraction of 0.25 and 0.30 , respectively , with the radius and mass fixed at the jovian values .",
    "the corresponding parameters , in particular the characteristic frequencies @xmath0 , are given in table [ parametershe ] .",
    "as can be seen , a higher helium mass fraction , hence a higher fraction of heavy elements in the envelope , tends to lower the value of @xmath0 , all things being equal .",
    "figure [ f14 ] portrays the low - degree , low - order eigenfreqdeuencies of the modal oscillations for the models of table [ parametershe ] .",
    "it appears that the remarks made concerning figure [ f12 ] , which deals with the dependence on the core mass , can be also made for figure [ f14 ] .",
    "such similarities are expected since , in both cases , it is the dependence on the global fraction of heavy elements that is under consideration .",
    "as can be seen on figure [ f14 ] , for low @xmath1 and very low @xmath2 , the eigenfrequencies slightly increase with the helium mass fraction @xmath29 , whereas for higher @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the eigenvalues unambiguously decrease with @xmath29 .",
    "as previously stated when discussing the presence of a dense core , if the low - degree , low - order modes were to be unambiguously identified , the corresponding frequency spectrum might give us a hint of the presence of heavy elements in the interior .      to investigate the evolution of @xmath0 for a given explanet",
    ", we build simple evolutionnary models of exoplanets with a mass fixed at 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , 10 , and 20 @xmath4 .",
    "we use the default formalism and modeling tools outlined in @xcite .",
    "the planets are in isolation , which means that no stellar irradiation is taken into account . no core has been added .",

    "as the radius stabilizes , so does @xmath0 .",
    "we fit the curves with straight lines in the region [ 2,5 ] gyrs , and we calculate the corresponding derivatives . we find that the derivative increases with the planet mass , from @xmath118@xmath160 @xmath161 for @xmath123 @xmath4 , to @xmath118@xmath162 @xmath161 for @xmath163 @xmath4 .",
    "we have calculated the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the pulsational modes of planets for a broad range of giant exoplanet models .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the dependence of the characteristic frequency @xmath0 , the eigenfrequencies of low degree f - modes , and the eigenfrequencies of low degree p - modes on several parameters : the planet mass , the planet radius , the core mass , and the helium fraction in the envelope .",
    "we provide the corresponding eigenvalues for a degree @xmath1 up to 8 and a radial order @xmath2 up to 12 .",
    "we also present values of @xmath0 for 174 known giant exoplanets , and highlight the strong dependence on the radius , around any value of the planet mass .    for jupiter and saturn",

    ", we presented @xmath0 and the low - degree , low - order eigenfrequencies of acoustic modes as a function of the core mass .",
    "we conclude that , for nonradial oscillations ( @xmath93 ) , the sensitivity of the pulsation frequencies to the core mass is important both for the f - modes and for the high - order p - modes .",
    "however , for specific intermediate values of radial order @xmath2 , this sensitivity is minimal over the whole range of core masses considered .",
    "focusing on giant exoplanets , we find that the dependence of the characteristic frequency on the core mass is more important for small radii and masses . as an example , the characteristic frequency of hd149026b , with measured radius and mass of 0.72 @xmath7 and 0.36 @xmath4 , varies by more than 26% across the range of core masses considered .",
