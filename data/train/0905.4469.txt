    "the authors , although not specified in the abstract , restrict their study to the case of weak spin - orbit coupling ( otherwise the notion of spin - current and their symmetries considerations do no longer hold ) and identify several tensor components in the equations relating spin current and charge current and identify a relating term kappa which they try to calculate .    they make a qualitative argument for the effect based on the previously used explanations of the work of sinova et al 04 ( not cited here ) which identify the rotation from effects in between collisions .",

    "<S> after the first experimental observations @xcite , the spin hall effect in semiconductors and metals attracted much interest and became the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies @xcite.most of the theoretical work is devoted to the intrinsic ( not related to electron scattering ) mechanism of spin - charge coupling @xcite , which was first proposed by karplus and luttinger @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we introduce another transport phenomenon belonging to the same family . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that because of spin - orbit interaction , a given spin current induces not only the charge current , but also a transverse _ spin current _ with interchanged spin direction and the direction of flow . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to this transformation as the _ swapping _ of spin currents .    </S>",
    "<S> the notion of spin current was introduced in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is described by a tensor @xmath0 where the first index indicates the direction of flow and the second one shows which component of spin is flowing . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we write down the phenomenological equations describing the coupling between spin and charge currents , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( more accurately , @xmath2 is the electron _ flow _ density , related to the electric current density @xmath3 by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the elementary charge ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider an isotropic material with inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> then we have @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the primary currents , which may exist in the absence of spin - orbit interaction , @xmath9 is the unit antisymmetric tensor and @xmath10 is a dimensionless parameter proportional to the strength of spin - orbit interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> pure symmetry considerations allow for additional terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_2 ] ) proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which describe transformations of spin currents . in the presence of electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 and spin polarization @xmath14 , this would result in additional contributions to @xmath0 proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which were mentioned already in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the physical origin of these contributions was not understood at the time and the effect was not studied ever since .    </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the additional terms should always enter in a combination @xmath17 so that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_2 ] ) should be modified as : @xmath18 with a new dimensionless parameter @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will also show that the resulting swapping of spin currents originates from the correlation between the scattering direction and spin rotation during collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is more robust than the spin - charge coupling : the swapping constant @xmath19 exists already in the born approximation , while @xmath10 appears only beyond this approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical origin of the swapping effect can be readily seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 illustrating the spin dependent scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the most important element is the magnetic field @xmath20 existing in the electron s moving frame and seen by the electron spin . </S>",
    "<S> this field is perpendicular to the plane of the electron trajectory and has opposite signs for electrons moving to the right and to the left of the charged center . </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman energy of the electron spin in this field is , in fact , the spin - orbit interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> three spin - dependent effects can be seen :    \\1 ) the precession of the electron spin around @xmath20 during the collision , leading to the elliott - yafet spin relaxation .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) the spin asymmetry in scattering ( the mott effect , or skew scattering ) resulting from the additional force proportional to the gradient of electron zeeman energy .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 ) the _ correlation _ between the directions of electron spin precession and scattering . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can see that while the spin on the left trajectory is rotated clockwise , the spin on the right trajectory is rotated counterclockwise . this correlation and its consequences for spin transport </S>",
    "<S> were not discussed previously . </S>",
    "<S> we will now see that this correlation leads to a transformation of spin currents .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the incoming electrons move in the @xmath21-direction and are polarized along @xmath21 ( spin current @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons scattered to the left ( right ) will acquire a small positive ( negative ) projection of spin on the @xmath23 axis . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the initial @xmath22 spin current is partly transformed to @xmath24 . for the case when incoming ( along @xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> electrons are polarized along @xmath23 , a similar reasoning shows that the initial spin current @xmath25 will give rise to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the latter case the spin direction and the direction of flow are interchanged . </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , one can derive the spin current transformation law : @xmath27 , as expressed by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the reason why the terms @xmath11 and @xmath12 enter in such a combination can be explained as follows . since the spin - orbit interaction is weak , the transformed currents are small compared to the primary currents . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the primary current contains only one component , say @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> in the first order in spin - orbit interaction there should be no correction to _ this _ component . </S>",
    "<S> ( similarly , when a vector @xmath29 is rotated on a small angle , the first order correction @xmath30 is perpendicular to @xmath29 . ) </S>",
    "<S> the combination @xmath17 is the only one to meet this requirement . </S>",
