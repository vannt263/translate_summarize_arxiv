    "<S> we show that the zeroth principle of thermodynamics applies to aging quasistationary states of long - range interacting @xmath0-body hamiltonian systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the measurability of the temperature in these out - of - equilibrium states using a _ short - range _ interacting thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> as many connections are already established between such quasistationary states and nonextensive statistical mechanics , our results are the first evidence that such basic concepts apply to systems that the nonextensive formalism aims to describe .    </S>",
    "<S> 2 the zeroth principle  if systems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in thermal equilibrium with @xmath3 , they are in thermal equilibrium among them  , is one of the basic principles in physics . </S>",
    "<S> it establishes the transitivity of the temperature , and its importance can hardly be overestimated , being essential to the logical formulation of thermodynamics . in particular , it is fundamental in thermometry , which resides at the very grounds of experimental physics . </S>",
    "<S> recently , considerable attention has been driven to @xmath0-body hamiltonian systems that constitute paradigmatic models for long - range interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these systems present several anomalies in their behavior . among them , negative microcanonical specific heat , inequivalence between canonical and microcanonical ensembles , vanishing lyapunov spectrum , lvy walks and anomalous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> quite remarkably , aging has also been exhibited @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the appearance of long - lasting ( possibly infinite - lasting in the thermodynamical limit ) metastable or quasistationary states ( qss ) , characterized by a non - gaussian velocity distribution and by a temperature that does not coincide with the one predicted by the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the bg thermal equilibrium is attained at much later times , after a crossover time which diverges with @xmath0 . using a standard dynamical definition of the temperature , </S>",
    "<S> we show that _ the zeroth principle of thermodynamics applies to these qss in a manner which is essentially the same as for conventional thermal equilibria_. moreover , we exhibit that thermalization occurs even if measured with a thermometer that , in contrast with the ` thermal bath ' that is probed , is _ short - range _ interacting . </S>",
    "<S> as these systems present a considerable number of connections @xcite with nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite , our findings constitute a strong suggestion that these basic concepts apply to situations that the nonextensive formalism aims to describe .    </S>",
    "<S> long - range interacting systems constitute nowadays an exciting frontier topic in many areas of physics ( astrophysics , nuclear physics , plasma physics , bose - einstein condensates , atomic clusters , hydrodynamics , among others ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they also provide an interesting arena in a trans - disciplinary perspective as prototypical systems that enable the study of analogies or differences between alternative approaches . in particular , interesting results are now available which exhibit @xcite inequivalences between standard bg approaches and methods of dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider , as einstein pointed out in 1910 @xcite , that the foundations of statistical mechanics lies on dynamics , this is a major point worthwhile to be deeply analyzed .    as a representative example of such a richness of behavior , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian mean field model , which describes a system of @xmath0 planar classical spins interacting through an infinite - range potential , has been largely considered in the literature @xcite . this hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 , \\label{h}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the @xmath6th angle and @xmath7 is the conjugate variable representing the angular momentum ( unit inertial moment is assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is the inertial version of the @xmath8 ferromagnetic spin model , with the interaction terms connecting not only first neighbors but all couples . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is common use , although not necessary @xcite , to divide the potential term by @xmath0 in order to make the hamiltonian formally extensive . defining the mean field vector @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 ) </S>",
    "<S> , an analytical bg canonical solution of this system predicts a second - order phase transition from a low - energy ferromagnetic phase with magnetization @xmath11 , to a high - energy one with the spins homogeneously oriented on the unit circle and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical point is at energy density @xmath13 , and a caloric curve can be exactly obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it is quite simple to integrate numerically the equations of motion and to study the dynamical behavior of the system by means of molecular dynamics simulations for a relatively large number of spins @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when this is done for energy densities ( slightly ) below the critical point , with some nonzero - measure class of out - of - equilibrium initial conditions @xcite , one finds that the system is dynamically stuck in quasistationary nonequilibrium states _ whose duration diverges with _ @xmath0 . consistently with standard equilibrium statistical mechanics , a ` dynamical temperature ' @xmath14 can be defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy and @xmath17 is time . in the present approach , we use the qualification dynamical in the sense that this definition purely descends from dynamics and not from a thermal contact with a thermostat . for system ( [ h ] ) , during the qss , the temperature @xmath18 evolves into a first plateau _ below _ the bg equilibrium temperature @xmath19 , before relaxing to a second plateau that coincides with @xmath19 . the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is maximal for energy density around @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 depends on the size @xmath0 of the system , but tends to a well defined value @xmath21 as @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that other long - range interacting models display qss with temperature _ above _ </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , aging @xcite and non - gaussian one - body marginal velocity distributions characterize the qss . as strong numerical evidences indicate @xcite , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 , the qss lasts forever . </S>",
    "<S> if we are attempting a thermodynamical description of such a system , it is fundamental to discuss the zeroth principle under these conditions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we would like to know what would be the response of a thermometer testing the quasistationary temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to provide an answer to these questions we numerically integrate the hamilton equations using the @xmath23th order symplectic neri - yoshida integrator @xcite with energy conservation @xmath24 , under different setups . in our first simulation </S>",
    "<S> we examine precisely the textbook construction for deriving the canonical ensemble as a subsystem of the microcanonical ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> first , we consider the isolated hamiltonian system ( [ h ] ) , composed by @xmath0 spins . </S>",
    "<S> our out - of - equilibrium initial conditions consist in setting every angle parallel , e.g. , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the angular momenta distributed inside an interval around the origin with a fixed separation @xmath27 between them , but each with a random shift that could be up to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we renormalize the distribution in order to have total energy density @xmath20 and zero total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these initial conditions are very similar to the ones normally used in the literature , the so - called ` _ _ waterbag _ _ ' initial conditions , but the present setup yields a lower initial temperature , just above @xmath28 , which results in both smaller fluctuations and a longer duration of the anomalous plateau . </S>",
    "<S> then , we take into account two distinct subsystems of the isolated system , each of them consisting of @xmath29 spins , with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the first ( second ) subsystem is composed by the most ( least ) energetic initial data , so that its initial temperature @xmath31 is larger ( smaller ) than the one , @xmath32 , of the isolated system as a whole . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the result of a _ single _ typical simulation , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath35 relaxes after some time to @xmath36 , _ while the isolated system is still in the qss_. this situation lasts until all systems undergo together the expected relaxation to @xmath19 , due to finite - size effects . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that the subsystem starting with the higher temperature , in its relaxation to the temperature of the isolated system , crosses @xmath19 with no signs of attempts to relax to @xmath19 itself . </S>",
    "<S> this result , for the qss , precisely complies with the zeroth principle of equilibrium thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , two systems are in thermal ( meta)equilibrium with a third system , and in thermal ( meta)equilibrium with each other . </S>",
    "<S> also , this verification clearly opens the possibility for a generalized canonical treatment of the qss , as all subsystems with @xmath30 share the same dynamical temperature after an initial transient . </S>",
    "<S> such a detailed study is presently under course @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our second simulation addresses the question of the measurability of the qss dynamical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by considering the system ( [ h ] ) as a _ thermostat _ and by constructing a _ thermometer _ very different from the system ( [ h ] ) , in the sense that it complies with the usual bg laws . </S>",
    "<S> the difference lies , more precisely , in the fact that we choose _ short - range _ </S>",
    "<S> interactions for the thermometer , both for its own dynamics and for its coupling with the thermostat . </S>",
    "<S> the thermometer is then composed by @xmath29 classical spins whose hamiltonian is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{hm}\\ ] ]    it has the same potential as the thermostat , but it only connects first neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this short - range interaction results in a standard bg system as we will see below . </S>",
    "<S> the thermometer is prepared as follows : before entering into contact with the thermostat , we set the thermometer coordinates to @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 taken from a gaussian distribution whose standard deviation is chosen in order to start with a particular temperature of our choice . </S>",
    "<S> we then let the system evolve freely for enough time until complete bg equilibrium is achieved with a maxwellian one - body marginal velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41 resulting coordinates are then used as initial conditions for the contact with the thermostat . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we are confident that we are starting with a thermometer in a usual bg equilibrium . on the other side , </S>",
    "<S> the thermostat is prepared in the ` water bag ' initial conditions previously described and we let evolve the two systems separately , until any quick transient states have disappeared . at a convenient time @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> they are `` connected '' through an interaction term @xmath43 , \\label{hint}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a random natural number between @xmath45 and @xmath0 ( fixed once for ever ) that describes the connection between thermometer and thermostat spins . </S>",
    "<S> we include also a coupling constant @xmath46 to regulate the intensity of the interaction term ( the coupling constant between spins of the same system is equal to unity ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we call @xmath47 the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , the total system after @xmath42 is then described by the hamiltonian @xmath48    results of a _ single _ typical simulation with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to appropriately choose the range of the numerical value of the coupling constant @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we want on one hand to establish a significative coupling between the systems , but on the other hand to produce a not too large perturbation of the thermostat . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this care to become less and less restrictive as we numerically approach the theoretical limit @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the thermometer temperature @xmath53 , chosen in order to start below the thermostat temperature , stays few time steps in its initial equilibrium state and afterwards starts to grow rapidly to reach the thermostat temperature @xmath54 , and _ </S>",
    "<S> relaxation occurs completely within the qss _ , for @xmath55 time steps ( fluctuations are of course present because of finite - size effects ) . differently with the previous case , </S>",
    "<S> the thermometer eventually begins to relax to its equilibrium temperature , _ before _ the thermostat starts its final thermalization . as explained below , we consider this as one more finite - size effect . </S>",
    "<S> note in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] that the time at which the thermometer leaves the thermostat temperature approximately coincides with its minimum , that is known to be present just after the thermostat finally relaxes to @xmath19 @xcite .    when the thermometer is prepared in order to have , before contact , a temperature which is higher than that of the thermostat , our results show no clear signs of thermalization . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 increases steadily until it attains its definite equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior will hopefully disappear when computers will allow simulations with even larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to notice that , even preparing the thermometer with a temperature below @xmath56 , thermalization occurs only for @xmath0 and @xmath57 sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> for example , simulations with @xmath58 and @xmath34 do not show any thermalization .    taking all these facts in consideration , </S>",
    "<S> namely , thermometer temperature reaching bg equilibrium before the thermostat , no relaxation for @xmath59 , no relaxation for too small @xmath0 and @xmath57 , and also taking into account the fact that the system is aging , one may suspect what follows . </S>",
    "<S> the model ( [ h ] ) behaves like having some internal mechanism that , after a certain amount of time , for finite @xmath0 , pulls the system out of the qss to a bg equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism works like an internal clock that regulates this thermalization time , and may function like a potential well whose deepness decreases with time . </S>",
    "<S> a system with large enough fluctuations , compared to the well depth , will never be confined by the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> a system with small enough fluctuations is constrained to the well , but just for a limited amount of time , until the well becomes shallow and its depth becomes comparable to the fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in our case , the effect of the well would be to restrict the system to visit just a part of the phase space , while not being in any well during a long time would be associated to an homogeneous visit , the system thus becoming ergodic and relaxing to the expected bg temperature ( see @xcite for a low - dimensional analogy ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , within this picture , fluctuations would greatly influence the system permanence in the qss . </S>",
    "<S> note that this scenario is also consistent with the relaxation of subsystems of an isolated system as observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .    in order to state our conclusions , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that in the last years considerable interest has been raised in the study of long - range interacting systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significant progress has been made in the description and comprehension of out - of - equilibrium qss that by no means accommodate within the bg scenario . </S>",
    "<S> these qss display an anomalous temperature plateau @xcite and various other anomalies that are consistent with the nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite picture . among them , vanishing lyapunov exponents @xcite ( see @xcite for illustrative connections between nonextensive statistical mechanics and vanishing lyapunov exponents ) </S>",
    "<S> , lvy walks and anomalous diffusion @xcite , aging involving @xmath60-exponential ( i.e. , asymptotically power - law ) time correlation functions @xcite , @xmath60-exponential one - body marginal velocity distributions @xcite , and @xmath60-exponential relaxation to the bg equilibrium @xcite . summarizing , if one wants to design a generalized statistical mechanical approach for the description of these qss , a fundamental step concerns the validity of the zeroth principle . </S>",
    "<S> our present results exhibit that this basic law of thermodynamics also applies to the qss , and has therefore a domain of validity which is wider that the one normally associated with it within bg statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have provided evidence that the qss dynamical temperature is actually detectable by a normal short - range thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the present findings establish fundamental grounds for forthcoming research in the area . </S>"
