    "pep - ii  @xcite has been operating at the betatron tune @xmath1 close to @xmath2 in the high energy ring ( her ) and @xmath3 in the low energy ring ( ler ) .",
    "these working points were selected experimentally for a reliable machine performance , good luminosity and beam lifetime .",
    "however , the beam - beam simulations predict that luminosity can be increased by operating betatron tune very close and above the half - integer resonance .",
    "[ fig : lumin ] shows the ler tune diagram with synchro - betatron resonances up to the 4th order and a contour plot of the single bunch luminosity .",
    "calculation of luminosity was done using the beam - beam code developed at slac  @xcite which has been recently upgraded to the three dimensional version .",
    "the difficulty of operating close to half - integer resonance comes from enhancement of the resonance effects on betatron motion .",
    "it is well known that perturbation of @xmath0 function created by focusing errors depends on tune @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is phase advance , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is a focusing error created mainly by quadrupole field imperfections , horizontal orbit at sextupoles , and momentum error .",
    "close to half - integer resonance , growth of @xmath9 comes from the resonance term @xmath10^{-1}$ ] which behaves as @xmath11 when distance to the resonance is as small as @xmath12 . on the other hand , orbit and dispersion",
    "are not excited by the half - integer resonance .    for significant enhancement of luminosity , fractional value of horizontal tune should be in the range of @xmath13\\!\\approx\\!.51 $ ] . at this working point ,",
    "enhancement of @xmath14 in her and ler due to the resonance term in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : dbeta ] would be a factor of 6.7 and 12.8 , respectively , compared to the present tune . without compensation ,",
    "the large @xmath0 growth may significantly increase amplitude dependent non - linear aberrations and reduce dynamic aperture and beam lifetime .",
    "@xmath15s@xmath16.,width=309 ]    more resonance effects are generated by the synchrotron sidebands of the half - integer resonance : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a synchrotron tune , and @xmath19 are integers . in the ler ,",
    "where @xmath20 , the 1st and 2nd synchro - betatron resonances occur at @xmath13\\!=\\!.5125 $ ] and .525 , while in her with @xmath21 the 1st sideband is at @xmath13\\!=\\!.5225 $ ] .",
    "tracking simulations will show that the sidebands have a strong effect on dynamic aperture , therefore working tune should be chosen reasonably far from them .",
    "in addition , variation of tune with synchrotron momentum oscillations should be minimized to avoid crossing with these resonances .",
    "optimization of pep - ii lattice near half - integer resonance and analysis of dynamic aperture are discussed below .",
    "the optics with @xmath22  cm at the interaction point ( ip ) is used .",
    "pep - ii has two tuning sections which can be locally adjusted to change betatron tune without affecting the rest of machine optics .",
    "initially , only these sections were modified to move the horizontal tune closer to half - integer , and vertical tune to @xmath23\\!\\approx\\!.61 $ ] as suggested by beam - beam analysis . but tracking simulations showed that dynamic aperture was not sufficiently large with machine errors and synchrotron momentum oscillations of up to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the _ rms _ value of relative momentum spread @xmath26 in the beam .",
    "analysis of chromaticity indicated that non - linear variation of horizontal tune with momentum needs to be further reduced to avoid crossing with the synchro - betatron resonances .    in pep - ii , the most contribution to non - linear chromaticity",
    "is generated in the final quadrupole doublets near ip .",
    "this chromaticity is compensated by the interaction region ( ir ) sextupoles located in the same phase with the doublets .",
    "variation of strength of these sextupoles allows to compensate quadratic dependence of tune on @xmath26 , and a small adjustment of sextupole phase advance helps reduce the higher order variation .",
    "minimum of the second order chromaticity was achieved by reducing strengths of the ir sextupoles correcting horizontal chromaticity .",
    "further improvement in ler resulted from reduction of horizontal phase advance between the ir horizontal sextupoles and ip by @xmath27 .",
    "for correction of the machine linear chromaticity , strength of the global sextupoles was increased to compensate for the weaker ir sextupoles . because the adjusted ir sextupoles in ler have a non - zero design orbit , the reduced sextupole strength created a feed - down effect of linear focusing and coupling .",
    "this small perturbation was compensated by a slight adjustment of the ir magnet strengths .    the optimized horizontal tune for momentum range of @xmath28 is shown in fig .  [ fig : htunex ] ,  [ fig : ltunex ] , where the working point is @xmath29 in her and @xmath30 in ler .",
    "the straight dash lines depict the half - integer synchrotron sidebands . in her ,",
    "a positive linear chromaticity @xmath31 was used in fig .",
    "[ fig : htunex ] to counteract the negative slope of non - linear tune variation . due to the large synchrotron tune",
    ", it was possible to place the her working point below the 1st synchrotron sideband without crossing with the resonance lines . in the ler ,",
    "synchrotron tune is a factor of 2 smaller while energy spread is 25% larger , therefore the closest to half - integer working point was chosen between the 1st and 2nd sidebands .     at @xmath32.,width=309 ]     at @xmath33.,width=309 ]",
    "calculations of dynamic aperture were performed using tracking simulations in lego code  @xcite .",
    "first , dependence of aperture on betatron tune near half - integer resonance was investigated for lattice without magnet errors , but with synchrotron momentum oscillations of @xmath24 .",
    "the resultant horizontal tune scan is shown in fig .  [ fig : hscanx ] , [ fig : lscanx ] for her and ler , where dynamic aperture is normalized by the _ rms _ size of a fully coupled beam .     at @xmath34 .",

    "the strongly affecting resonances are @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "naturally , the working tune should be chosen reasonably far from these resonances .",
    "the following scenarios for more and less aggressive horizontal tune @xmath44 near half - integer were investigated in the simulations :    1 .",
    "her : 24.51 , ler : 38.518 . 2 .",

    "dynamic aperture scan versus vertical tune was performed for the first scenario of @xmath44 and the range of @xmath23 $ ] from .55 to .64 .",
    "it showed that dynamic aperture gradually reduces as @xmath23 $ ] becomes closer to @xmath13 $ ] and the working point approaches the crossing of half - integer and coupling resonances .",
    "based on this scan , the vertical fractional tune of @xmath23\\!=\\!.61 $ ] was chosen for these simulations .",
    "a lower @xmath45 may be considered for further luminosity enhancement .",
    "secondly , tracking simulations with field errors , misalignment and @xmath46 synchrotron momentum oscillations were performed for the selected working points . for statistics ,",
    "ten different settings ( `` seeds '' ) of random machine errors were used in each tracking .",
    "perturbation of beam orbit , linear chromaticity , betatron tune and vertical dispersion was compensated using realistic correction schemes in lego .",
    "since distortion of @xmath0 function becomes more sensitive to focusing errors near half - integer resonance , a special correction of @xmath47 was implemented in lego .",
    "it uses micado method to find the most effective quadrupoles to minimize @xmath0 perturbation .    due to the greater effect of errors near half - integer resonance ,",
    "a better machine correction is needed to maintain acceptable dynamic aperture . to verify tolerance to various errors ,",
    "simulations were performed for different levels of machine correction .",
    "it has been confirmed that beam orbit should be decreased for an acceptable dynamic aperture .",

    "as expected , the simulations confirmed that compensation of @xmath50 is required in the first scenario , where @xmath44 is closer to the resonance .",
    "typically , @xmath51 was corrected to the _ rms _ level of @xmath52 . in the second scenario , at @xmath13\\!=\\!.529 $ ] , correction of @xmath0 function was less important , although it helped to improve cases with small aperture .",
