    "a larger @xmath121 means a larger @xmath122 , and therefore a larger @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) and smaller @xmath125 .",
    "it will be seen that the reason for the larger @xmath109 at large @xmath110 at the lhc energy is the larger longitudinal expansion of the granular source at the lhc energy as compared to that at the rhic energy ( see fig .",

    "the error bars for the results are statistical errors .",
    "one can see that the average emission time decreases with increasing collision centrality and increases with increasing collision energy .",
    "it is because that the average droplet velocity increases with decreasing collision centrality and increasing collision energy .",

    "the values of @xmath133 , which is also referred as the source lifetime , are almost independent of @xmath110 and smaller as compared to the values of @xmath134 . for a fixed @xmath110 , the average source velocities increase with decreasing collision centrality . at large @xmath110 ,",
    "the average longitudinal velocities of the granular sources at the lhc energy are larger than the corresponding values at the rhic energy .",
    "it is because that the pion pairs with larger @xmath110 at the lhc energy correspond to a larger average emission time in the source center - of - mass frame ( see fig .",

    "the large longitudinal velocity of the granular source at the lhc energy boosts strongly the pair momentum of the particles with almost the same emission direction , and leads to the large @xmath109 results .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the emission time mentioned in the paper is the time recorded from the initial state of the granular source .",
    "the real emission time from the beginning of collision should also plus the system pre - equilibrium time @xmath135 and the breakup time @xmath136 , which should be different for different collision energies @xcite and centralities . however , the lifetime of the granular source is independent of the time original point .",
    "the small source lifetime is a character of the granular source @xcite .",
    "we systemically investigate the pion transverse momentum spectrum , elliptic flow , and hbt interferometry in the granular source model for the heavy ion collisions at the rhic highest energy and the lhc energy .",
    "the centrality and energy dependence of the observables at the two energies are examined . by comparing the granular source results with the experimental data of the au - au collisions at @xmath69 gev at the rhic and the pb - pb collisions at @xmath68 tev at the lhc with different collision centralities",
    ", we investigate the geometry and velocity parameters in the granular source model as a function of collision centrality and energy .",
    "the space - time structure and expansion velocities of the granular sources at the rhic and lhc energies with different centralities are examined .",
    "our investigations indicate that the granular source model can well reproduce the experimental data of pion transverse momentum spectra , elliptic flow , and hbt radii in the au - au collisions at @xmath0 200 gev with 05% , 1020% , and 3050% centralities @xcite , and in the pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 2.76 tev with 1020% and 4050% centralities @xcite .",
    "the experimental data of pion momentum spectra , elliptic flow , and hbt radii impose very strict constraints on the parameters in the granular source model .",
    "they exhibit certain regularities for collision centrality and energy .",
    "the space - time structure and expansion velocities of the granular source are consistent with that reflected by the observables .    in the granular source model",
    "we assume that the system created in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions occurs fragmentation and forms the granular source of qgp droplets due to the dynamical instability in the fast expansion at the early stage and the surface tension of the strongly coupled qgp .",
    "we use ideal hydrodynamics to describe the droplet evolution and assume a gaussian distribution for the droplet radius for simplicity . because many droplets evolve simultaneously , the source lifetime is smaller as compared to that of a continued big source , which evolves in whole and freeze out from the source surface . for the granular source ,",
    "the distribution of particle - emitting points of single event presents a clump - structure during the source evolution .",
    "however , the distribution of source points for many events is continued and presents a volume distribution because of the contribution from the droplets in the central region of the source . the short source lifetime , clump - structure of source points distribution of single event , and volume distribution of source points for many events are the characters of the granular source .",
    "the investigations for the granular source parameters indicate that the qgp droplets initially distribute in larger transverse and longitudinal regions for the more central and higher energy collisions .",
    "so , the distribution width of source points increases with increasing collision centrality and energy . in transverse direction ,",
    "the droplet velocity of central collision is smaller than that of peripheral collision in the center region of the source , although the droplet transverse velocity of central collision is larger at the edge of the source .",
    "the average longitudinal velocity of droplet is larger than the average transverse velocity of droplet . the droplet longitudinal velocity increases with decreasing collision centrality .",
    "the larger droplet velocities in the peripheral collisions lead to larger average velocities of source . because the difference of the droplet transverse velocities in and out of reaction plane decreases with collision centrality , the elliptic flow decreasing with collision centrality . in hbt interferometry",
    ", the difference between the transverse hbt radii @xmath63 and @xmath64 is related to the transverse velocity of particle pair , the source lifetime , and the space - time correlation of source points .",
    "both the quantities @xmath137 and @xmath138 increase with the decreasing collision centrality and increasing transverse momentum of the pair , @xmath110 .",
    "however , the difference of the two quantities for a fixed @xmath110 is approximately equal to zero .",
    "this leads to the results of @xmath139 .    while one may argue on the details and the number of parameters used in the granular source model , the consistent explanation of a large number of measured one - particle and two - particle correlation quantities suggests that this model description captures some fundamental features of the space - time dynamics .",
    "after all , it is a challenge to a model to explain the experimental data of the momentum spectra , elliptic flow , and hbt radii simultaneously at the rhic and lhc energies , and the final criterion for a model is experiments",
    ". it will be of interest to improve the granular source model and investigate the effects of qgp viscosity and droplet interaction on the granular source parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the studies of the forming mechanism and signals of the granular source will be of interest .",
