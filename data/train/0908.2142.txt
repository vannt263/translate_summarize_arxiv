    "maximal entangled states are the basic resource for the encoding and communication on quantum information @xcite . in open systems entanglement",
    "degrades and it is necessary to design strategies that preserve or partially recover the entanglement .",
    "error correction codes@xcite , filtering and distillation of entanglement @xcite and the use of decoherence free sub - spaces @xcite , are some of such strategies .    in a typical protocol for distillation of entanglement",
    "there are two observers , alice and bob and two o more copies of bipartite entangled system .",
    "each observer has access only to one part of the system on which he or she may applicate local operations .",
    "these operations can be independent ( filtering ) or collectives ( proper distillation ) . in a proper distillation protocol at the end of the process , after the collective operations have been completed , the observers execute a set of local measurements on some copies ( the ancillas ) leaving one copy ( the source ) untouched . by the effect of measurements the ancillas collapse to separable states , transferring its entanglement to the undisturbed copy .",
    "the most used protocols , i.e. bennett s protocol @xcite and deutsch s protocol @xcite , use bell diagonal states as the resource from which to extract entanglement .",
    "in fact , bennett s protocol starts with a werner state obtained by applying a random bilateral rotation to an arbitrary state .",
    "maximal entangled states are obtained only after an infinite distillation steps .    in @xcite ,",
    "verstraete _ et .",
    "_ show that all the mixed states of a 2-qubits system are classified in two equivalence classes . the first class is formed by the states which are equivalent to a bell - diagonal state under local @xmath1 transformations .",
    "the second class is formed by states which are represented by non - diagonal matrices ( in the bell basis ) parametrized by four real parameters .",
    "it comprises four sub - sets depending on the values of the parameters .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors advocate the use of non quasi - separable states ( see section 2 ) to distill states with maximal entanglement in a finite number of distillation steps . in this work",
    "we first review the structure of quasiseparable states for @xmath0 systems and show that all non - quasiseparable states are non diagonal and belong to one of the four sub - sets mentioned before .",
    "this study allows to define a finite round protocol for distilling , at any time , a maximal entangled state in a two qubits system at zero temperature .",
    "starting with singlet , it is shown that the system evolves inside the set of non - quasiseparable states , allowing the application of the protocol at arbitrary times . for thermal baths at non zero temperature",
    "the states of the systems are always quasi - separable , so it is not possible to distill a bell state . nevertheless under certain conditions it is possible to increase the entanglement applying the same protocol used for vacuum .",
    "consider a mixed state @xmath2 , with non vanishing probabilities @xmath3 and the transformations that change the probabilities without adding or suppressing any pure state in the mixture : @xmath4 the new probabilities @xmath5 should be also non vanishing , and we will refer to @xmath6 as a new state of @xmath7 . by definition a state @xmath8",
    "is called quasi - separable if at least one of its new states is separable .",
    "if a given final state is obtained through a distillation process using @xmath9 copies of the original state , then the same final state may be obtained with different probability from any of the new states of @xmath8 .",
    "this implies in particular that is not possible to distill a maximal entangled state using a finite number of copies if the source or the ancilla are in quasiseparable states . in order to distill bell states ,",
    "is useful to determine which states of the @xmath0 system are not quasiseparable .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one can distill a bell state from a given state obviously one can distill the same bell state from any other state obtained by local operations and classical communication .",
    "now we consider the states of the system inside the equivalent classes defined by verstraete _",
    "et al _ in @xcite .",
    "the first class is composed of bell - diagonal states , they can be written as : @xmath10 with @xmath11 the four bell states .",
    "for any mixed bell diagonal state one can observe that it is possible to find a new state for which all the probabilities are the same , this new state is separable without mattering the rank of the original matrix .",
    "so , excluding bell states , all bell diagonal states are quasi - separable and are not useful in order to distill a bell state .    following the classification , the second class is formed by non diagonalizable states represented by matrices of the form : @xmath12 here the entries @xmath13",
    "satisfy one and only one of the following four conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath14 2 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 3 .",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 4 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20    the cases 2,3 and 4 correspond to separable states from which it is not possible to distill any entanglement .    in the first case one",
    "is compelled to consider two kind of states . for a non conditioned @xmath21",
    "the rank of the matrix is 3 and the state takes the form :    @xmath22    requiring normalization one puts @xmath23 and @xmath8 can be decomposed as follows , @xmath24 with @xmath25 the state @xmath6 defined by @xmath26 is a new separable state of @xmath8 , and so all the states of form ( [ uto1 ] ) with unconditioned @xmath21 are quasiseparable .",
    "consider now the states with matrices of rank 2 defined by setting the coefficients @xmath27 .",
    "the density matrix in this case is : @xmath28 any new state of this @xmath8 can be written as @xmath29 the concurrence of this state is @xmath30 .",
    "since by definition @xmath31 , it is clear that the concurrence is different from zero for any choice of @xmath32 .",
    "the main concussion is that these states are not quasiseparable .",
    "in this section we review briefly the distillation protocol introduced by cheng _ et .",
    "al . _ in ref .",
    "suppose that one has a set of @xmath0 systems which are in the state ( [ ito2 ] ) .",
    "use one half of the systems as a source and the other half as the ancilla .",
    "alice execute a unilateral not operation on the source particles , then state of the source becomes : @xmath33 the ancilla remains in the original state .",
    "now alice and bob execute unilateral c - not operation on their respective particles regarding the source as control and the ancilla as target .",
    "finally alice and bob make a measurement in the computational basis of the ancilla . if they get the @xmath34 result the ancilla collapses to @xmath35 and the source to @xmath36 .",
    "the success probability in this case is @xmath37 .",
    "one can increase the success probability allowing the use of the @xmath38 as a valid result . in that case",
    "the final reduced density matrix of the source is not more the bell state but an state with same structure than the original one : @xmath39 the concurrence of this state is @xmath40 and the probability of success is @xmath41 . in figure",
    "( 1 ) we plot the concurrence of the distilled state and the concurrence of the non - distilled state . as one can see the protocol that include both results increases the entanglement only when @xmath42 .",
    "[ fig11 ]     and @xmath38 result ]    in figure ( 2 ) we compare the probability when one takes only the result @xmath43 with that when one takes the result @xmath43 and @xmath38    [ fig2 ]     and when one takes @xmath43 and @xmath38 results ]",
    "the master equation for a system composed of two two - level particles in vacuum is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we assume that the baths associated with each particle are independent .",
    "if the initial state is the singlet the solution is : @xmath47 in this case the protocol studied in the previous section allows one to distill the singlet @xmath48 at an arbitrary time with probability @xmath49 .",
    "the protocol run as follow : a ) divide the particle into two similar sets , one as source and the other as ancilla .",
    "b ) alice applies a not operation on the ancilla c ) both observers apply a c - not operation regarding the source as control and the ancilla as target .",
    "b ) each observer measures the ancilla waiting for the result @xmath43 .",
    "c ) if the result is successful the source is left in the state @xmath50 d ) alice applies a @xmath51 pauli rotation in order to obtain the singlet @xmath48 as final state .",
    "the master equation for a system composed of two two - level particles in the presence of two independent thermal baths is @xmath52 where we are assuming that both baths have the same temperature so they have the same average number @xmath9 of thermal photons .",
    "the solution of this equation with a singlet as initial condition is @xmath53 with @xmath54 @xmath55    @xmath56    the concurrence of this state is given by : @xmath57 with @xmath58 if one now applies exactly the same protocol described in the previous section the source is left in the following distilled state @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the success probability and @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63@xmath64 are the eigenvalues of @xmath8 . the concurrence of the distilled state is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 in the figure ( 3 ) we plot both the original and the distilled concurrence .",
    "as one can see the gain in entanglement is appreciable .",
    "we have presented a classification of quasi - separable states in @xmath67 systems that identifies the set of non quasi - separable states with part of the non diagonal mixed states class . more precisely : a non quasiseparable state is given by setting the four parameters of the non diagonal state equal to @xmath68 .",
    "having characterized non quasiseparable states , we presented a distillation protocol which allows to increase the entanglement of the original state using a finite number of copies . for systems in vacuum",
    "it is possible to recover a maximally entangled state with probability greather than zero but smaller than @xmath69 . by changing the accepted results in the measure of the ancilla , it is possible to obtain a final state with increased entanglement ( but not maximally entangled ) and probability greater than @xmath69 .",
    "finally , this protocol can also be applied in the case of non zero temperature .",
    "in this situation the system evolves with a comparatively sustained entanglement before the entanglement sudden dead time , although the probability rapidly falls bellow one half .",
