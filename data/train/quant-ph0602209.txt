    "quantum information processing ( qip ) has been a very active area of research in the past few years @xcite .",
    "the current challenge for qip is to coherently integrate a sufficiently large and complex controllable system and then requires the ability to transfer quantum information between spatially separated quantum bits . since then numerous approaches for this purpose have been proposed , ranging from linear and nonlinear quantum optical devices to various interacting quantum systems . among them , many studies proposed using the internal dynamics of coupled spins for the transfer of quantum information @xcite .",
    "however , the basic and necessary optical devices  ( for the electron wave or the spin wave ) in a solid system are scarce due to the technology at hand .",
    "therefore , it is significant to probe the possibilities to construct the artificial optical devices  and then build the corresponding electronic networks for the matter wave of electron within a solid state system @xcite . here",
    ", we notice that , for the boson system , plenio , hartley and eisert @xcitehave studied the quantum network dynamics of a system consisting of a large number of coupled harmonic oscillators in various geometric configurations for the similar purpose .",
    "this paper will pay attentions to the fermion systems where the bloch electrons move along the quantum lattice network .",
    "we consider various geometrical configurations of tight - binding networks that are analogous to quantum optical devices , such as beam splitters and interferometers .",
    "we then consider the functions of these tight - binding networks in details when initially gaussian wave packets are entering these devices .",
    "analytical and numerical investigations show that these devices are controllable by the magnetic flux through the network .",
    "characteristic parameters of devices can be adjusted by changing the flux or the interactions on nodes .",
    "the relevant quantum phenomena , such as generation of entanglement and the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effects in the solid state based devices are also discussed systematically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the hamiltonians of the simplest tight - binding lattice systems with and without magnetic field as building blocks to construct various networks , which can be formed topologically by the linear and the various connections between the ends of them . in section iii",
    ", we theoretically design and analytically study the basic properties of a star - shaped tbn , then also explore the further dynamic property of @xmath0-shaped network . surprisingly , for appropriate joint hopping integrals , the complicated network can be reduced into an imaginary linear chain with homogeneous nn hopping terms plus a smaller complicated network .",
    "it is known that such tbns are analogous to quantum optical devices such as beam - splitters , entangler and interferometers . in section iv , we investigate the dynamic properties of a bloch electron model on a @xmath1-shaped lattice , which consists of a terminal chain and a ring threaded by a magnetic flux .",
    "the appropriate flux through the network can reduce the network to the linear virtual chain , which indicates that the flux can control the propagation of gwp in the network . in section",
    "v , the interferometer network , a mimic of the ab effect experiment , is also studied in the similar way .",
    "in addition , in the whole paper , a moving gauss wave packet ( gwp ) localized in a linear dispersion regime is a good example to illustrate the properties of the above bloch electron networks . in section",
    "vi , we extend the results of the tbns to the spin network ( sn ) for the dynamics of the single magnon . in section vii ,",
    "we summarize the results of this paper and suggest the possible applications of these tbns .",
    "in this section , we introduce the systems under consideration , namely the tight - binding bloch electron systems and the hamiltonians of the building blocks to construct various networks . without loss of the generality , we concentrate our attention on the simplest tight - binding systems , in which only the hopping term or kinetic energy is considered .    a general tight - binding network ( tbn )",
    "is constructed topologically by the linear tight - binding chains and the various connections between the ends of them .",
    "an important element in the system is the aharonov - bohm flux through some loops of the tbn . here , we consider the simplest tight - binding model , in which only the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping terms are taken into account .",

    "the hopping integral could be the complex number due the presence of the external magnetic field . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our study to a simplest case described as following .",
    "when the field is absent , the hopping integral for a homogeneous chain@xmath8}=te^{i\\phi _ { l , j+1 } }   \\label{ct}\\]]in a chain is real and identical ( i.e. , independent of sites ) while in the presence of a vector potential the hopping integral is modified by a phase factor . here , we defined the link phase @xmath9with flux quanta @xmath10 as an integral of the vector potential @xmath11 along the link between the sites @xmath7 and @xmath12 in the @xmath4th chain .",
    "the above observation about the phase modification of hopping integral can be found in many modern literatures gauge - trans , tight - binding but the proof can be cast back to peierls peierls .",

    ", a network can be equivalent to the simple sum of several independent imaginary chains with the aid of the transformation @xmath21 .",
    "there is a remark to be made here : in usual , the role of the potential @xmath11 shows as the ab effect of bloch electron in a close chain ( or called a tight - binding ring ) . here",
    ", the local magnetic filed strength for bloch electron may vanish , but the loop integral of @xmath25the * *  * * magnetic flux does not .",

    "in this section , we use analytical method and numerical simulation to study the basic blocks of quantum network , the star- and y - shaped beams , which is constructed by connecting one ends of several chains to the end ( a node ) of a single chain .",
    "beam splitters are the elementary optical devices frequently used in classical and quantum optics @xcite , which can even work well in the level of single photon quanta @xcite and are applied to generate quantum entanglement @xcite . for matter wave , an early beam splitter can be referred to the experiments of neutron interference based on a perfect crystal interferometer with wavefront and amplitude division n - interfer . moreover , for cold atoms , a beam splitter have been experimentally implemented on the atom chip @xcite .",
    "the theoretical method has been suggested to realize the beam splitter for the bose - einstein condensate @xcite .    in the following , we begin with the basic properties of the corresponding networks for fermions . we will show that , for appropriate joint hopping integrals",

    "the fact that the input chain @xmath42 is a part of this virtual linear chain implies that the bloch electron can perfectly propagate in this virtual linear chain without the reflection by the node .",
    "this also indicates that there is a coherent split of the input electronic wave because the wave function in this virtual chain actually is just a superposition of wave functions in the @xmath16 chains .    to sketch our central idea",

    "for other values of @xmath26 and @xmath314 , when the two gwps reach the node for the second time , parts of them get out while the rest parts remain moving in the ring . especially , when @xmath256 , the coupling constants and the chemical potentials satisfy the relation discussed in the section transmission - reflection film .",

    "in the above discussion , we studied the fermion systems where the bloch electrons move along the quantum lattice network .",
    "we consider various geometrical configurations of tbn that are analogous to quantum optical devices , such as beam splitters and interferometers . in this section",
    ", we will apply the results obtained for tbn to another analogue system , spin network ( sn ) where the spin wave acts as the bloch electron .",
    "the basic setup of a sn is constructed topologically by the linear spin chains and the various connections between the ends of them . here , we consider the spin-@xmath432 @xmath433 model , in which only the nearest neighbor ( nn ) coupling term is taken into account .",
    "the hamiltonian of a sn reads    @xmath434    where the hamiltonians of leg @xmath4 consisting of @xmath2 spins and the joints are@xmath435}(s_{l , j}^{+}s_{l , j+1}^{-}+h.c . ) ,   \\notag \\\\",

    "although the sns and tbns have the same structure , the physics should be different due to the difference of the intrinsic statistical properties .",
    "then the analytical conclusions for tbn are not available to sn .",
    "however , in the context of state transfer , only the dynamics of the single - magnon is concerned .",
    "notice that for hamiltonian ( [ hs ] ) , the @xmath437-component of the total spin @xmath438 is conserved , i.e. @xmath439=0 $ ] .",
    "thus in the invariant subspace with @xmath440 , this model can be mapped into single - particle tbn .",
    "in summary , we studied various geometrical configurations of tight - binding networks  for the fermion systems .",
    "it is found that the lattice networks for moving gwps are analogous to quantum optical devices , such as beam splitters and interferometers . in practice",
    ", our coherent quantum network for electronic wave can be implemented by an array of quantum dots , josephson junctions or other artificial atoms .",
    "it will enable an elementary quantum device for scalable quantum computation , which can coherently transfer quantum information among the integrated qubits . * *  * * the observable effects for electronic wave interference may be discovered in the dynamics of magnetic domain in some artificial quantum material .    in the above studies , we only consider the spinless  bloch electron .",
    "actually , all the conclusions we obtained can be extended to the networks of spin-@xmath432 electrons , if the external magnetic field does not exert any forces or torques on the magnetic moment of spin , but only a phase on the wave function of electron .",
    "the hamiltonian of such system has the similar form with ( [ h ] ) and ( [ joint ] ) under the transformation @xmath441 .",
    "note that , for the new hamiltonian , the spin of electron is a conservative quantity that can not be influenced during the propagation @xcite .",
    "the electronic wave packet with spin polarization is an analogue of photon flying qubit , where the quantum information was encoded in its two polarization states .",
    "thus , these networks can function as some optical devices , such as beam splitters and interferometers .",
    "these are expected to be used as quantum information processors for the fermion system based on the possible engineered solid state systems , such as the array of quantum dots , josephson junctions or other artificial atoms that can be implemented experimentally .",
