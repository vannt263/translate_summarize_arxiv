    "<S> therefore we focus on the change of resonant frequency with microwave power , which is a measure of the change in kinetic inductance , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the cooper - pair density , whereas the quality factor is a measure of the losses due to the quasi - particles . the kinetic inductance is given by the imaginary part of the conductance , which is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ sigma ] ) gives , for low values of @xmath21 , low frequencies ( corresponding to the condition ( [ lim ] ) ) and low temperatures @xmath89 a simple linear relation between @xmath21 and the shift of kinetic inductance @xmath90 with respect to its value without rf field @xmath91 :    @xmath92    to facilitate the comparison of eq . </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath94 is the ( internal ) power of the microwave radiation in the resonator and @xmath95 is the material parameter which relates the critical current to power , with @xmath96 the impedance of the coplanar waveguide , @xmath97 the normal state resistivity of the superconducting resonator ( al ) , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 the width and thickness of the superconducting strip , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this conversion was done under the assumption of a uniform distribution of the supercurrent across the strip .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dvi]d we show the shift of the resonant frequency as a function of microwave power calculated using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ delta2 ] ) as the red line . in the same figure </S>",
    "<S> the black squares correspond to the experimental data of de visser et al@xcite , determined for a resonant frequency of 5.3 ghz , well above @xmath100 ( 64 mk ) and well below @xmath2 ( 2.2 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we include the experimental data as black squares , which agree very well with the theoretical prediction , except at the highest power . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the analysis of the measured resonance curves the non - linearity in the kinetic inductance was not taken into account . by including the nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance in the analysis of the measured resonance curves following swenson et al@xcite the black data - points from @xcite </S>",

    "<S> these results have also implications for the density of thermal quasiparticles for a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> obviously the reconfiguration of the ground state in the presence of microwave power reduces the condensation energy and therefore we expect for a given bath temperature a rapid increase in the number of quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the number of excess quasiparticles @xmath101 can be measured by further detailed studies of their fluctuations in a superconducting strip@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that these other observables of the experiment @xcite ( number of quasiparticles , recombination time , quality factor ) , which more dominantly depend on @xmath102 as compared to @xmath103 , are still dominated by a redistribution of the quasiparticles due to microwave absorption ( eliashberg@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast @xmath103 is a measure of the cooper - pair current .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct test of the present theory would be a measurement of the density of states by tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> in such an experiment the time - dependent electric field should only be in one of the electrodes parallel to the tunnel - junction and not across the tunnel - junction . this requirement is to avoid that the dc tunneling process in itself is controlled by an additional ac electric field across the tunnel barrier , the well - known effect of photon - assisted tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a dc electric field should be across the tunnel junction to probe the electrodes with the tunneling current . </S>",
    "<S> the device could in practice be made as a transmission - line . </S>",
    "<S> a solution for such an experiment has been implemented by horstman and wolter@xcite , which is very feasible with the current level of technology . </S>",
    "<S> instead of the nonequilibrium distribution function one should extract the density of states , similarly to the experiment for dc pairing carried out by anthore et al@xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a theoretical analysis of the quantum depairing effect by a microwave field for a long thin strip of a diffusive s - wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the density of states loses a sharp peak at the gap energy and acquires features at photon points @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> also we have shown that the density of states develops an exponential - like tail in the sub - gap region . </S>",
    "<S> both phenomena are in strong contrast to the case of depairing by a dc current . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the predicted effect is responsible for the shift of the resonant frequency of an al superconducting resonator by microwave power@xcite .    </S>",
