    "since the introduction of line tension by gibbs  @xcite as the excess free energy of any region where multiple material interfaces meet , both experimental and theoretical determination of line tension values for three - phase systems have been the subject of various studies ( cf .",
    "reviews  @xcite ) .",
    "however , given the wide variety of reported values ranging from   to   with either sign  @xcite , further research is required in order to clarify the physics underlying line tension , also regarding the large number of situations in which line tension may be important .",
    "generally , this is the case for systems with high contact line curvature , e.g. nanoparticles at fluid - fluid interfaces  @xcite , wetting of micro- and nanostructured as well as nanoporous surfaces  @xcite , or silicon nanocrystal growth  @xcite .    to further motivate this study",
    ", it is instructive to ask for the origin of the uncertainties mentioned above .",
    "first of all , line tension can only be indirectly accessed experimentally and is also strongly influenced by a number of unknown system parameters , e.g. roughness or impurities  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the theoretical calculation of line tension appears to be straightforward once a clear definition has been given .",
    "however , the incorporation of long - range van - der - waals interactions into so - called local models  @xcite turns out to be challenging because the choice of the a priori unknown functional form of the disjoining pressure influences the results  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "density functional theory studies are usually limited to lennard - jones fluids  @xcite .",
    "the situation is quite different for long - range interactions due to electric double layers ( edls ) where the required expressions can be derived from poisson - boltzmann theory , which is the purpose of the present work .",
    "owing to the intricate nature of van - der - waals and other interactions contributing to line tension , here we confine ourselves solely to the electrostatic contribution .",
    "similar to other works  @xcite , we consider a wedge - shaped three - phase contact region between a 1 - 1 electrolyte , a non - polar solid substrate , and a non - polar fluid .",
    "the fluid - fluid interface  @xmath0 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : ksys]a ) as well as the interface  @xmath1 separating the non - polar fluid from the substrate are assumed to be uncharged .",
    "electric - double layer effects are modeled based on poisson - boltzmann theory .",
    "we define the electrostatic line tension as the free energy difference per unit length of contact line between a `` microscopic '' state , corresponding to the true equilibrium state with a deformed fluid - fluid interface , and a `` macroscopic '' state given by the linear extrapolation of the fluid - fluid interface down to the solid substrate ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ksys ] ) .    .",
    "microscopic ( solid line ) and macroscopic ( dashed line ) states with corresponding line tension contributions.,width=326 ]    this definition of line tension is consistent with schemes to determine the molecular line tension  @xcite . in that sense , the electrostatic line tension results from the fluid - fluid interfacial deformation caused by osmotic and electrostatic forces .",
    "we remark that our model is fundamentally different from the one presented by kang et al .",
    "@xcite , for the latter does not include interfacial deformation , which is our original motivation for introducing a line tension , and neglects the chemical contribution to the free energy . within poisson - boltzmann theory@xcite ,",
    "the total free energy of double layer formation consists of a chemical part , resulting from the electrochemical potential difference gained by ions forming the interfacial charge , and an electric part due to electric work performed .",
    "the chemical part of the edl free energy has to be considered along with the electric part whenever interfacial charge is changed , whereas at fixed interfacial charge only the electric part is modified .",
    "the line tension discussed in this work contains chemical and electric contributions , but is occasionally termed `` electrostatic line tension '' to distinguish it from the more frequently considered `` molecular line tension '' in the absence of an edl .",
    "consideration of interfacial deformation gives rise to several contributions to the free energy difference relative to the macroscopic picture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ksys ] ) .",
    "first , the substrate area wetted by the electrolyte is reduced , implying a change  @xmath2 in the molecular and electrochemical free energy .",
    "secondly , the area of the fluid - fluid interface is changed , leading to another interfacial energy contribution  @xmath3 .",
    "thirdly , the free energy of the edl is modified due to the deformation at fixed three - phase contact line ( tcl ) adding the quantity  @xmath4 to the edl contribution already included in  @xmath2 .",
    "summing up these three contributions we arrive at the line tension  @xmath5 .      throughout the paper we use dimensionless quantities choosing the debye length  @xmath6 as the length scale , the product of fluid - fluid interfacial tension  @xmath7 and debye length as the scale for free energies per unit length , and @xmath8 , where  @xmath9 is the interfacial charge density at the substrate - electrolyte interface  @xmath10 and  @xmath11 is the permittivity of the electrolyte , as the electrostatic potential scale , respectively .    in what follows",
    "we assume that the non - polar fluid has a negligible permittivity as compared to the electrolyte . as a consequence ,",
    "the pressure deforming the fluid - fluid interface can be expressed by the electrostatic potential  @xmath12 on the interface and the tangential electric field  @xmath13 in the electrolyte phase right at the interface .",
    "the interfacial shape may be described in the @xmath14-coordinate system , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksys]c , by a parameterization  @xmath15 with  @xmath16 and  @xmath17 . defining the non - dimensional products  @xmath18and  @xmath19 , where  @xmath20 denotes the elementary charge , @xmath21 boltzmann s constant and  @xmath22 the temperature , we write the interfacial stress balance  @xcite in the form @xmath23^{3/2}}=-2\\frac{\\psi}{\\chi^2}\\left[\\cosh(\\chi\\phi)-1\\right]_{(\\eta , h(\\eta))}-\\psi \\left.e_{t}^2\\right|_{(\\eta , h(\\eta))}. \\end{split } \\label{eq : tpbsprungdimlos}\\ ] ] while the left - hand side of eq .   represents the interfacial tension force , the right - hand side consists of the fluid pressure which is given by the osmotic pressure ( first term ) , and of the maxwell stress due to the tangential electric field ( second term ) . in the construction of the line tension model , we apply the debye - hckel approximation ( @xmath24 ) . as a consequence , eq .",

    "the interfacial shape  @xmath15 influences the electrostatic potential , since the latter is the solution to the problem @xmath27 in order to find  @xmath28 and  @xmath12 , both of which are required for calculating  @xmath29 , we assume a perturbation expansion in powers of  @xmath26 for all dependent variables , e.g.  @xmath30 . while incorporating the perturbation expansions into eqs .  , and   is straightforward , condition   demands careful examination , as it contains the shape  @xmath15 both explicitly and implicitly . in effect , full expansion of the boundary condition   projects the latter onto the undeformed interface given by  @xmath31  @xcite , as can be seen from the relation @xmath32 + \\mathcal{o}(\\psi^2)=0 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] eq .   can be easily rewritten in terms of the polar coordinates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksys]c .",
    "the zeroth - order problem is thus identical to the one treated by drr & hardt  @xcite , allowing to use the model equation @xmath33 which contains the function  @xmath34 .",

    "generally , we consider differences in the total  electrical plus chemical  free energy of the system  @xcite when deriving  @xmath2 and  @xmath4 . the contribution  @xmath2 associated with the shift of the tcl by a distance of  @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ksys]a ) may be written as @xmath55 the first term in eq .",
    "describes the contribution due to the interfacial energies  @xmath56 and  @xmath57 and has been reformulated by means of young s relation  , while the second term corresponds to the total free energy of a planar edl of width  @xmath54 within the debye - hckel approximation  @xcite . using eqs .   and   as well as the relation  @xmath58 ,",
    "eq .   can be cast in the form @xmath59+\\mathcal{o}(\\psi^3).\\ ] ] the contribution  @xmath3 , originating from the change in fluid - fluid interfacial area , can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : ksys]c and eq .   and",
    "is given by @xmath60 from eqs .",
    "and we find that the terms @xmath61 cancel each other when the sum of all contributions to the line tension is considered .",
    "therefore , as stated above , knowledge of the shape  @xmath43 is not required for the second - order line tension .",
    "the reason for the terms to drop out is the fact that  @xmath46 is an apparent contact angle obeying the ( modified ) young equation   which corresponds to a vanishing free energy variance when the tcl is shifted  @xcite .",
    "furthermore we note that , since the free energy difference due to the shift of the tcl is already included in  @xmath2 , the third contribution  @xmath4 solely consists of the total edl free energy difference due to deformation of the fluid - fluid - interface at fixed tcl and is thus unaffected by the zeroth - order potential  @xmath36 .",
    "hence@xcite , @xmath62 holds within the debye - hckel approximation .",
    "furthermore , by insertion of eq .   and use of the identity  @xmath63 @xcite , we can write @xmath64 from eqs .  , and",
    ", the full line tension is @xmath65 + \\mathcal{o}(\\psi^3 ) \\end{split } \\label{eq : tau}\\ ] ] and scales as  @xmath66 for small  @xmath26 , which is at variance with a result of order  @xmath26 based solely on the electric free energy , as reported by kang et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we consider the total free energy of the microscopic and macroscopic state consistent with the definition of line tension .",
    "for numerical verification and for studying non - perturbative line tension effects , we solved the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann problem   by means of the finite - element solver comsol multiphysics^^ , starting from a wedge geometry and iteratively adjusting the interfacial shape calculated from eq .  , similar to a procedure in electrowetting studies  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the appropriate nonlinear expressions for the edl free energy  @xcite were numerically evaluated .",
    "quadratic shape functions and an element size of  @xmath67 close to the tcl were used .",

    "therefore , the agreement between numerical data and the second - order result   is reasonable for all values of  @xmath72 shown and for  @xmath46 above  55 . in order to point out the improvement due to the inclusion of interfacial deformation , the first - order approximation of eq .",

    "[ fig : dtheta_modell ] . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : pi1tau_modell ] and  [ fig : dtheta_modell ] , the model is not suited to represent the region of  @xmath73 .",
    "that fact must be attributed to the potential distribution which can not be accurately represented within the assumptions made by drr & hardt@xcite , namely an exponential potential distribution at the fluid - fluid interface , regardless of the functional form of  @xmath35 . in particular",
    ", the contact angle difference mainly depends on the potential value at the tcl ( cf .",
    "eq .  ) and is thus directly affected by the accuracy of the model for the potential distribution .",
    "therefore , the model can be considered valid only above  @xmath74 .",
    "+    regarding the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann regime , it is instructive to consider a realistic system where the fluids are water and air , respectively . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : tau_comsol ] , @xmath29  decreases towards large negative values when  @xmath46 is small , an effect pronounced at large interfacial charge density  @xmath9 .",
    "+    for the latter , high but physically reasonable values were chosen  @xcite , given in the legend of figs .",
    "[ fig : tau_comsol ] and  [ fig : dtheta_comsol ] .",
    "a sign change of  @xmath29 with varying  @xmath46 is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig : pi1tau_modell ] and  [ fig : tau_comsol ] ( cf .",

    "[ fig : tau_comsol ] ) .",
    "the difference between  @xmath44 and  @xmath46 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtheta_comsol ] , is mainly governed by  @xmath9 and only slightly affected by the debye length .",
    "in summary , to the best of our knowledge we performed the first analytical and numerical analysis of electrostatic line tension based on the commonly accepted picture of `` microscopic '' and `` macroscopic '' states in wetting scenarios .",
    "agreement between our model and the numerical results over a significant range of the chosen perturbation parameter was demonstrated . as a striking property of the electrostatic line tension we found a change in sign from positive to negative when the macroscopic contact angle  @xmath46 is decreased . with  @xmath46 approaching zero",
    ", the line tension apparently diverges as a result of the growing discrepancy between the micro- and macroscopic state . for  @xmath75 ,",
    "for example , the electrostatic line tension of water can assume values of around  -15pn ( cf .",
    "[ fig : tau_comsol ] ) , similar to experimental line tension values recently reported , such as -30pn  @xcite and  -35pn  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the electrostatic line tension in situations of high interfacial charge density and small contact angle may significantly contribute to experimentally determined line tension values .",
    "since the electrostatic line tension is mainly governed by the interfacial charge density , it is tunable via the ph value of the electrolyte .",
    "this mechanism could be utilized in context with nanoparticles adsorbed at fluid - fluid interfaces , in the sense that negative line tension stabilizes the particles as opposed to positive line tension .",
    "accordingly , the stability of interfacial nanoparticles is expected to be a function of the ph value of the electrolyte phase . as a possible extension of the theory presented here ,",
    "the electrostatic line tension in the presence of surfactants is expected to attain significant values and thus deserves attention .",
