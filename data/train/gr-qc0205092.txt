    "for thirty years relativists have been concerned with the question of the uniqueness of black hole solutions to the einstein equations either in vacuum or coupled to various types of matter .",
    "the focus of research during this period has frequently been the proof of uniqueness theorems for various types of black hole geometry ( static or axisymmetric ) and different types of matter ( especially electromagnetic fields ) . over the past ten years or so",
    ", a plethora of different black hole geometries have been found in many models , so that attention has tended to shift towards finding such solutions ( hairy black holes ) .",
    "the einstein - scalar field system has long been a favourite during this period . as will be outlined below ( see section [ sec : status ] ) , in asymptotically flat space there are many theorems which rule out scalar field hair for various couplings to the geometry and different types of scalar field potential . in the presence of a cosmological constant , and with minimal coupling to the geometry , non - trivial solutions to the field equations have been found , representing black holes with scalar field hair . in this article",
    "we will consider a non - minimally coupled scalar field with a non - zero cosmological constant , so that the geometry approaches ( anti-)de sitter ( ads / ds ) space at infinity rather than being asymptotically flat .",
    "space - times which are asymptotically ( anti-)de sitter have become the centre of attention in recent years , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , observations of high - redshift supernovae suggest that the universe may possess a small , positive cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "theoretically , there has been much interest in the ads / cft ( conformal field theory ) correspondence ( see @xcite for a review ) and its more recent relative the ds / cft correspondence ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , a negative cosmological constant is a key ingredient of `` brane world '' scenarios ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "black holes with these asymptotic geometries play a particularly important role in all these developments .",
    "we shall be primarily concerned with a conformally coupled scalar field since in this case the computations are more straightforward .",
    "this is also the coupling which is most interesting from two points of view .",
    "firstly , as outlined in section [ sec : status ] below , there exists a non - trivial solution to the einstein - conformally coupled scalar field equations in asymptotically flat space , although the physical interpretation of this solution has been controversial because the scalar field diverges at the event horizon . for other values of the coupling",
    ", there are no known non - trivial solutions to the field equations in asymptotically flat space .",
    "secondly , conformal coupling is the most natural quantum scalar field model to study in quantum field theory in curved space .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : status ]",
    "we briefly review the various no - scalar hair theorems , for both minimally and non - minimally coupled scalar fields . in section [ sec : model ] we outline the model under consideration and derive the boundary conditions on the scalar field .",
    "next , in section [ sec : conformal ] , we use a conformal transformation to map the conformally coupled scalar field system to one involving a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "we carefully elucidate the conditions under which this transformation is valid .",
    "we are then in a position to study whether or not there are solutions to the latter system .",
    "we firstly consider the case in which the cosmological constant is positive ( section [ sec : ds ] ) , and show , via a simple proof ( following bekenstein @xcite ) that does not make use of the conformal transformation , that no solutions are possible .",
    "in the situation when the cosmological constant is negative , we find non - trivial solutions in section [ sec : ads ] .",
    "the stability of these solutions is investigated in section [ sec : stab ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] includes our conclusions and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section we review the status of the no - scalar hair conjecture , for both minimally and non - minimally coupled scalar fields .",
    "a more comprehensive review , complete with rigorous theorems , can be found in @xcite .",
    "a nice summary of the status of the no - hair conjecture in general can be found in @xcite .",
    "the seminal paper on the subject of no - scalar hair theorems is @xcite , in which bekenstein rules out non - trivial hair for a massive scalar field @xmath0 minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the remarkable thing about @xcite is the simplicity of the argument , which uses only the scalar field equation and the geometric properties of the black hole space - time at the regular event horizon and at infinity .",
    "it does not require detailed analysis of possible solutions ; nor the assumption of spherical symmetry ( although staticity is assumed , the result can be extended to stationary black holes @xcite ) ; nor the einstein equations .",
    "the theorem can be readily extended to scalar fields having a convex potential @xmath1 , so that @xmath2 and although bekenstein s original theorem is concerned only with asymptotically flat space - times , it can be readily extended to spherically symmetric , asymptotically de sitter geometries @xcite .",
    "this argument will be exploited in section [ sec : ds ] to show the absence of conformally - coupled scalar field hair for asymptotically de sitter black holes .",
    "after this early work of bekenstein , the subject of scalar field hair goes fairly quiet in the literature .",
    "the subject of black hole hair received a new lease of life in the early 1990 s by the discovery of non - trivial black hole solutions in @xmath3 einstein - yang - mills and related theories ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of this topic and an extensive bibliography ) . in the light of this explosion of interest in hairy black holes , the old question of scalar field hair was re - addressed , and the original theorems of bekenstein extended .",
    "several authors @xcite proved the no - scalar hair theorem for a positive semi - definite potential @xmath4 , although now with the additional assumption of spherical symmetry , but still in asymptotically flat space .",
    "these results rule out non - trivial scalar fields having the `` double well '' higgs potential .",
    "the sudarsky theorem @xcite is particularly simple , but it does not extend to the situation with a cosmological constant @xcite . in this paper , we shall not make use of the energy - based arguments of @xcite , due in part to the subtleties involved in making appropriate definitions of energy in non - asymptotically flat space - times , or where there is non - minimal coupling to the geometry .",
    "bekenstein himself made an important contribution @xcite to this expanding area by proving a no - scalar hair theorem for a very general model involving many scalar fields , again assuming spherical symmetry and minimal coupling to the geometry , but otherwise making no assumptions about the form of the interactions between the scalar fields .",
    "the theorem relies on the assumption that the weak energy condition is satisfied by the matter fields , i.e. the stress - energy tensor @xmath5 satisfies : @xmath6 for all time - like vectors @xmath7 , and the analysis makes use of the conservation equations for the stress tensor and the einstein equations .",
    "the weak energy condition ( [ eq : weak ] ) is satisfied by a single scalar field with the usual lagrangian and a positive semi - definite potential , but it should be stressed that the result in @xcite is considerably more general than this and makes much weaker assumptions .",
    "more recently , scalar fields in models with a non - zero cosmological constant have been studied .",
    "the inclusion of a positive cosmological constant allows minimally - coupled scalar field hair to exist for positive semi - definite potentials but not convex potentials @xcite .",
    "however , this hair is unstable . if a negative cosmological constant",
    "is included , stable scalar field hair is a possibility @xcite , in parallel with the situation in einstein - yang - mills theory ( see @xcite , where the existence of stable scalar field hair for asymptotically anti - de sitter black holes is conjectured ) . since the focus of the current work is models containing a cosmological constant , we shall not discuss these results in detail here , but return to them in later sections .",
    "so far we have considered only scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity . amongst",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar field theories , of particular interest is the case of a conformally coupled scalar field , although more general couplings can arise in scalar - tensor theories of gravity . here , as in the minimally coupled case ,",
    "seminal contributions to this topic have been made by bekenstein himself .",
    "bekenstein rediscovered @xcite a solution to the conformally coupled scalar field equations previously found by bocharova et al @xcite but unknown in the west .",
    "in this paper , following @xcite , we shall refer to this solution as the bbmb black hole .",
    "this solution represents an extremal black hole , but its physical interpretation has been the source of some controversy @xcite as the scalar field is divergent on the event horizon , although bekenstein @xcite argued that a particle coupled to the scalar field would experience nothing pathological at the event horizon .",
    "furthermore , this solution is unstable @xcite .",
    "this solution was revisited in the early 1990 s by zannias and xanthopoulos @xcite who proved that it is the unique static , asymptotically flat , solution of the einstein - conformal scalar field system .",
    "although the bbmb black hole described above violates the letter of the `` no - hair '' conjecture , since it is a non - trivial solution of the field equations , no new extra parameters are introduced , the only additional degree of freedom provided by the scalar field being a choice of sign .",
    "therefore this solution has only very limited `` hair '' , and certainly does not violate the `` spirit '' of the conjecture .",
    "very recently , martinez et al @xcite have found the generalization of the bbmb black hole in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , with the scalar field having a quartic potential . in this case",
    "the scalar field is regular on and outside the event horizon , with a pole inside the event horizon .    in the later 1990 s efforts",
    "were made to extend the uniqueness theorem of xanthopoulos and zannias to other non - minimally coupled scalar field theories , not just conformal coupling .",
    "again , bekenstein led the way , in a paper with mayo @xcite .",
    "there the no - scalar hair theorem is proved when the parameter @xmath8 which couples a neutral scalar field to the curvature ( for a precise definition see equation ( [ eq : action ] ) in section [ sec : model ] below ) is either negative or greater than one half .",
    "this paper leaves open the question of @xmath9 , which includes the conformally coupled case @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , the corresponding proof for a charged , non - minimally coupled scalar field is valid for all @xmath8 .",
    "related theorems for the neutral case and all values of @xmath8 can be found in two papers by saa @xcite , which however make various restrictions on the value of the scalar field , whilst the paper of bekenstein and mayo has stronger results in that the restrictions on the value of the scalar field required to prove the theorems are themselves proved , using energy arguments .",
    "it is striking that energy arguments can be applied to this system , as the non - minimal coupling means that the weak energy condition ( [ eq : weak ] ) , so crucial in the minimally coupled case , is no longer valid .",
    "the application of energy arguments to this non - minimally coupled system has not been without controversy @xcite , although there is additional numerical evidence @xcite that the theorems of bekenstein and mayo are in fact true .",
    "we will examine whether or not the energy conditions of @xcite are satisfied for the solutions we find in section [ sec : ads ] .",
    "we are now in a position to test the no - scalar hair conjecture for non - minimally coupled scalar fields in space - times which are no longer asymptotically flat .",
    "our model will contain a ( positive or negative ) cosmological constant and so we are interested in black holes in ( a)ds space .",
    "in this section we will outline the model to be considered in this paper , derive the corresponding field equations and use these to elucidate the boundary conditions on the fields .",

    "we note that the fact that we are considering only a conformally coupled scalar field is crucial in this proof , and for other , non - minimal couplings , the proof is considerably more complicated .",
    "furthermore , we are only considering a very restricted class of potentials ( corresponding to massless or massive scalar fields with no self - interactions ) and the proof will not readily extend to more general potentials ( as is the case with the original bekenstein proof in asymptotically flat space @xcite ) .",
    "the proof given here works equally well for conformal coupling ( and suitably restricted potentials ) in asymptotically flat space .",
    "for example , in asymptotically flat space , if the potential @xmath138 , then the scalar field @xmath0 vanishes like @xmath139 at infinity , whilst if @xmath140 then @xmath141 as @xmath142 , so that in each case the boundary term at infinity in ( [ eq : parts ] ) vanishes .",

    "however , in this case , it is straightforward to check that the integrand in ( [ eq : parts ] ) is no longer positive definite .",
    "we note , to end this section , that the proof also does not extend to the case where @xmath72 .",
    "in this situation , in the absence of a cosmological event horizon , we would integrate from the black hole event horizon out to infinity . from the analysis of section [ sec : model ] ,",
    "we are interested only in values of @xmath18 satisfying @xmath73 , in which case the behaviour of the scalar field @xmath0 at infinity is such that the boundary term in ( [ eq : parts ] ) does not vanish , although it is negative and so makes a positive contribution to the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : parts ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath73 , we can no longer say that the integrand in the first term of ( [ eq : parts ] ) , i.e. the integrand in ( [ eq : posdefbit ] ) , is positive definite and so the proof fails .",
    "this leaves open the possibility of non - trivial solutions in anti - de sitter space , and in the following section we shall show that such solutions do in fact exist .",
    "having shown that there are no non - trivial solutions to the conformally coupled scalar field equations in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , we shall , in this section , exhibit numerical solutions when the cosmological constant is negative , so that the geometry approaches anti - de sitter space at infinity .    in this section",
    "we shall use the conformal transformation approach outlined in section [ sec : conformal ] and are therefore tacitly assuming that this transformation is valid .",
    "this method depends on the quantities @xmath144 and @xmath145 being well - behaved and non - zero everywhere outside the event horizon . for the transformation of the fields given in",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , both these conditions automatically hold , so that if we can find a solution in the minimally coupled , transformed system , then we automatically have a well - behaved solution of the conformally coupled system .",
    "the converse is not however true .",
    "we firstly investigate the range of masses for which solutions of this nature are possible , since the mass alters the form of the minimally coupled scalar field potential ( see figure [ fig : neglpot ] ) . from the analysis of section [ sec : model ] , if @xmath146 , then @xmath55 , and the scalar field does not have convergent behaviour at infinity .",
    "therefore , for the remainder of this section , we consider only the case @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath64 , there are two possible behaviours at infinity : either @xmath55 or @xmath148 and is given by ( [ eq : phiinfinity ] ) . in the case that @xmath148 , the minimally coupled scalar field @xmath84 does not tend to zero at infinity ( since in section [ sec : conformal ] we chose our constant of integration so that @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 ) . working with the minimally coupled scalar field equations means that we can immediately apply the results of @xcite . from @xcite , it must be the case that @xmath84 approaches a stationary point of the potential @xmath90 at infinity .",

    "when @xmath87 , we have @xmath154 and therefore this is a local maximum of the potential ( since we are considering only the masses @xmath155 ) , while the values @xmath156 correspond to local minima .",
    "these points can be seen in figure [ fig : neglpot ] . in @xcite , it was found that a local maximum of the potential acted as an `` attractor '' for the scalar field at infinity , and that , while solutions in which the scalar field tended to a local minimum at infinity were possible , they necessitated a `` fine tuning '' in the parameters of the theory and were unstable .",

    "our approach is to numerically integrate the minimally coupled scalar field equations outwards from the event horizon for a particular initial value of the scalar field .",

    "therefore the scalar field is unable to have a maximum , which is necessary if it is to tend to zero at infinity .",
    "a similar line of reasoning applies if @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , using ( [ eq : uderivs ] ) the condition ( [ eq : initialcond ] ) becomes @xmath165 if @xmath166 , and @xmath167 if @xmath168 . in the former case ,",
    "then the right - hand - side of the inequality in ( [ eq : horcond1 ] ) is negative and the condition is automatically satisfied .",
    "however , in the latter case , ( [ eq : horcond2 ] ) places a restriction on the value @xmath169 of the minimally coupled scalar field at the event horizon , and the condition can only be satisfied for some @xmath169 if @xmath170 since @xmath171 for all @xmath172 .",
    "this is not a problem since , as discussed in section [ sec : model ] the conformally coupled scalar field has the desired behaviour at infinity only if @xmath173 .",
