    "dark matter ( dm ) annihilating in the galaxy has been proposed as the explanation for a number of current experimental anomalies . the payload for antimatter - matter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ( pamela ) experiment has observed an excess in the positron fraction in the energy range @xmath8 gev @xcite , and the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite observes an excess in @xmath9 at energies up to 1 tev , compared to the predictions of conventional diffusive models . the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) @xcite ,",
    "too , observes a steepening in the spectrum around a few tev which is in agreement with the fermi - lat excess . on the other hand",
    ", pamela does not observe excess antiprotons",
    ". therefore tev - mass particles that can annihilate preferentially into leptons are the preferred dm candidates for explaining these anomalies @xcite .",
    "theories of leptophilic annihilating dm have come under increasing pressure from a number of complementary constraints , due to the radio and gamma ray ( gr ) emissions that should be produced by the annihilation process itself ( ` prompt ' gamma rays ) @xcite or by the high energy @xmath10 , via synchrotron radiation in the galactic magnetic field or via inverse compton scattering on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons and the galactic radiation field ( starlight ) @xcite .",
    "such radiation could also partially reionize the universe after recombination , leading to distortions in the cmb @xcite .",
    "finally , relevant constraints are imposed by extragalactic gamma rays , produced by the annihilations in forming dm halos @xcite .",
    "many models of annihilating dm are seemingly ruled out by overproducing such radiation .",
    "in particular , inverse compton gamma rays produced in the galaxy would contribute to the gr spectrum observed by fermi - lat .",
    "a precise assesment of the strength of fermi inverse compton ( ic ) constraints depends however upon the details of the assumed dm density profile @xmath11 .",
    "the strongest constraints come from close to the galactic center ( gc ) ; therefore they can be satisfied if @xmath11 is not strongly peaked as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the distance from the gc .",
    "usually such dependence is illustrated by choosing a few different parametrizations of the profile with varying cuspiness ( _ e.g. , _ the peaked navarro - frenk - white profile @xcite as opposed to the cored isothermal @xcite or burkert profiles @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath14-body simulations and observations of our own galaxy suggest a reasonable range of shapes for @xmath11 , and it would be interesting to explore the dependence of the constraints on the characteristics of @xmath11 within such a range .",
    "one purpose of the present work is to fill this gap by quantifying the strength of the ic constraint for a wide range of dm density profiles .",
    "we limit ourselves to the einasto parametrization @xcite , which we find to be useful for this purpose since it allows for continuous variation in the cuspiness and it has been used to fit the results of high - resolution @xmath14-body simulations",
    ".    the constraints also depend upon which leptons , and how many of them , are assumed to be produced in the dm annihilations .",
    "for example , models that produce only @xmath15 are more strongly constrained , for a given dm mass @xmath0 , than those that produce two @xmath10 pairs , since the spectrum of the former is harder .",
    "this is a relevant distinction since some of the models that are most natural from the particle physics point of view necessarily produce the @xmath16 ( or at least @xmath17 plus an invisible hidden sector gauge boson ) rather than the @xmath17 final state .",
    "likewise models that produce muons are more strongly constrained than those that produce only electrons . moreover models using the gauge kinetic mixing portal produce an admixture of @xmath10 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 rather than just a single kind of final state . failing to recognize these distinctions , one could be misled into thinking that the general class of models is excluded , even though there may exist specific examples that satisfy all the constraints .",
    "thus another goal of the present work is to explore in detail the viability of a very specific set of annihilating dm models , which are also theoretically motivated @xcite-@xcite .",
    "namely we consider dm @xmath20 transforming under a nonabelian hidden sector gauge symmetry , taking the simplest example of su(2 ) and the lowest representations ( doublet or triplet ) for the dm .",
    "one of the dark gauge bosons @xmath21 is assumed to mix with standard model hypercharge ( and thus the photon ) through a dimension-5 gauge kinetic mixing operator .",
    "this model has a number of appealing features .",
    "the dm annihilates into dark gauge bosons , @xmath22 . by assuming the gauge symmetry breaks below the gev scale , so the @xmath21 s",
    "have mass @xmath23 gev , it is assured that only light leptons or @xmath19 are produced by the gauge boson decays , and no antiprotrons that would be in conflict with the pamela observations .",
    "the annihilation cross section is naturally enhanced by sommerfeld effect @xcite in this model , allowing it to have the correct relic density in the early universe , even though the cross section in the galaxy must be larger by a factor of order 100 than that needed for thermal freeze - out .",
    "a distinctive feature of the model is that small mass splittings @xmath24 1 mev between the dm states are generated at one loop .",
    "such splittings can be important for making the model consistent with direct detection constraints , by causing dm scattering on nucleons to be inelastic and endothermic .",
    "this allows the rate of dm interactions in detectors to be sufficiently suppressed despite having relatively large couplings to nucleons @xcite .",
    "the mass splittings can moreover lead to a significant increase in the sommerfeld enhancement factor @xcite , which effect we take into account here .",
    "in addition , they can potentially help to explain the annual modulation observed by dama / libra through the inelastic dm mechanism ( see for example @xcite ) , or the 511 kev excess observed by integral @xcite using the excited dm mechanism @xcite-@xcite , although we do not explore these directions in the present work .",
    "a further refinement we make compared to most previous analyses is to take into account the dependence of the sommerfeld enhancement on the position in the galaxy , an effect that was first pointed out in ref .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement depends sensitively on the dm velocity , and both the dm velocity dispersion and escape velocity depend upon @xmath13 .",
    "we find that this typically makes the enhancement larger near the galactic center where the gamma rays that are most important for the ic constraint are produced .",
    "the constraint thus becomes harder to satisfy than in models with a spatially constant boost factor , as is usually assumed .",
    "nevertheless , we find examples of models that are marginally able to produce leptons consistent with the pamela and fermi observations , and which are also barely consistent with the various gamma ray constraints .",
    "the preferred models have dm with @xmath3 gev and gauge boson masses below 200 mev , so that only electrons and no muons or charged pions are produced in the annihilations .",
    "however we find that the sommerfeld enhancement factor would always be _ too large _ to achieve this concordance if the dm was present at the expected relic density .",
    "we are obliged to suppress the rate of annihilations by introducing a factor @xmath25 in the density of the annihilating component .",
    "this can be achieved by increasing the gauge coupling appropriately so that the relic density is reduced .",
    "the minimum reduction @xmath26 occurs if the dm mass splitting is negligible , and smaller values @xmath27 are needed if @xmath28 mev .",
    "this comes about because of the @xmath29-dependence of the sommerfeld enhancement factor for multistate dm annihilations @xcite .    in the present work we do not consider astrophysical boost factors due to increased annihilation rate in substructures of the main halo @xcite-@xcite .",
    "inclusion of these effects would presumably strengthen the gamma ray constraints on the models , but on the other hand a fully consistent treatment of substructure effects should simultaneously consider the modification to the lepton signal from annihilations in subhalos @xcite .",
    "this could conceivably have a compensating effect that would weaken the constraints due to requiring less @xmath10 production near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "further investigation of this issue is in progress .",
    "we start by introducing the particle physics models in section [ models ] , and recalling the constraint upon the dark su(2 ) gauge coupling imposed by the relic density . in section [ boost_sect ]",
    "we analyze how large an enhancement factor is needed for the models to explain the anomalous lepton observations , the theoretical computation of the sommerfeld enhancement , and its phase space average in the galaxy .",
    "section [ icconst ] explains how we implement the inverse compton @xmath30 ray constraint for general dm einasto profiles , while other relevant constraints are discussed in section [ other ] .",
    "our main results showing which parameter ranges can be compatible with all the observations are presented in section [ results ] . we discuss their implications in section [ discussion ] .",
    "three appendices give details for the branching ratio of ground state dm annihilation into leptons ( app .",
    "[ brfr ] ) , the multistate sommerfeld enhancement ( app .",
    "[ bfa ] ) and the calculation of the dm escape velocity ( app .",
    "[ escvel ] ) as a function of radial position .",
    "for the purpose of testing a concrete and specific model , we will analyze the simplest examples of nonabelian hidden sector models that can explain the various cosmic ray anomalies ; namely a dark su(2 ) gauge group under which the dm transforms as a doublet or a triplet @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the dm and the gauge bosons is = 12|_i ( i_ij - m__ij)_j - b^a _ b_a^ - _ a b_a^y _ [ lag ] we assume that the dark higgs triplet @xmath31 gets a vev in the @xmath32 direction , so that @xmath33 mixes with the standard model hypercharge @xmath34 with strength = _ 2/[epsdef ] this causes @xmath33 to acquire a coupling of strength @xmath35 to any sm particle of charge @xmath36 , and therefore to mediate the decay @xmath37 in the doublet model , or @xmath38 in the triplet model . or @xmath39 respectively , in the doublet and triplet models . ]",
    "the value of @xmath40 is not strongly constrained ; it can be anywhere between @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite ( except for a small region around @xmath43-@xmath44 excluded by the e137 experiment if the dark gauge boson mass is less than 400 mev @xcite ) .",
    "these models can explain the pamela positron excess and fermi / lat @xmath10 excess through the annihilation @xmath45 , followed by the decays @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is any charged sm particle with mass less than @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 denotes the mass of @xmath33 ) .",
    "although higher mass fermions can be produced through off - shell gauge bosons , such processes have a much smaller cross section than those in which the @xmath33 s are on shell . using this fact",
    ", one can account for the lack of any antiproton excess in the pamela observations by assuming that @xmath49 is less than @xmath50 .",

    "it could therefore have a chemical potential that fixes its relic density independently of its annihilation cross section .",
    "this could provide motivation to consider @xmath56 as an additional free parameter for the doublet model , if one can find a mechanism for producing the asymmetry between @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "in later sections we will find that it is difficult to satisfy all constraints if the annihilating dm has the full allowed relic density , because the sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross section is too large .",
    "a more general possibility is that the gauge coupling exceeds ( [ relic_density ] ) by a factor @xmath59 , which leads to an enhancement in the cross section @xmath60 , and a consequent suppression in the density by @xmath61 .",

    "we therefore need not consider these bounds any further .",
    "the flux of energy injected by dm annihilation , from the recombination epoch until today through the formation history of dm halos , results in ionization and heating of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the ionization and heating can be produced both by the highly energetic ` prompt ' photons directly emitted in the annihilation of two dm particles , and by the lower energy photons produced by inverse compton scattering .",
    "the latter turns out to be by far the most important process ; in fact , the cross section for @xmath204 scattering decreases rapidly with the energy of the impinging photon , so that low energy photons are more efficient in removing the electrons from the atoms .",
    "these ` primary reionization ' electrons then deposit their energy in the intergalactic medium via several other interactions , freeing many more electrons and also augmenting the temperature of the gas . one way to constrain dm annihilation properties is therefore to look at the modifications of the cmb spectrum produced by the fact that the cmb photons meet an opaque medium ( with free electrons produced by the ionization ) in their journey from the surface of last scattering .",
    "this is in particular encoded in the total optical depth of the universe @xmath205 parameter .",
    "@xmath205 is measured by wmap to be @xmath206  @xcite , of which about 0.038 is due to the low - redshift reionization ( @xmath207 ) produced by stars . a dm - induced optical depth larger than 0.062 ( the 1@xmath140 upper bound of @xcite )",

    "while this was originally computed for 2-lepton final states , it applies equally well for the 4-lepton ones in which we are interested .",
    "all that matters is the total amount of energy that is injected in the primordial intergalactic gas in the form of  electromagnetically coupled \" final products ( electrons , positrons , photons , possibly hadrons , but not neutrinos ) .",
    "all such final products end up causing reionization and thus producing free electrons , regardless of the precise way in which the annihilation occurs .",
    "we neglect minor differences possibly introduced by the difference in the shape of the spectra .",
    "the dotted lines in fig.[allowed ] and [ triplet - allowed ] show these bounds .",

    "we consider the case where the annihilating dm constitutes a fraction @xmath25 of the total dm .",
    "since the annihilation rate scales like @xmath62 , the bound ( [ cmb_bound ] ) will be weakened by @xmath208 .      finally , we briefly review the extragalactic gamma ray constraints on dm annilation .",

    "it remains to explain some details of our methodology for predicting the effective annihilation cross sections , both for the lepton signal and for the ic @xmath30 ray signal .",
    "these can differ from each other somewhat because of the fact that most of the observed leptons are produced within 1 kpc of the sun , whereas the most important ic @xmath30 rays come from closer to the galactic center , and the sommerfeld enhancement of the cross section is position dependent .",

    "@xmath309 is a function defined as an integral that must be done numerically ( see eq .  ( 4.8 ) and footnote 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in general , the escape velocity from a given radius is given in terms of the gravitational potential 12 v_esc^2 = -(r ) = g_r^ m(r ) where @xmath310 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath13 .",
    "if all of the matter in the galaxy was dark , we could simply integrate @xmath11 to find @xmath310 , but baryons constitute a significant fraction of the matter in the inner part of the galaxy , so this would give an underestimate of @xmath117 .",
    "instead , one can try to infer the shape of @xmath310 from rotation curves , which measure the circular velocity @xmath311 .",
    "we thus have the relation v_esc^2 = 2_r^ v_c^2(r ) [ vesc_est ]    for flat rotation curves , @xmath310 increases linearly with @xmath13 , and @xmath312 goes like @xmath313 .",
    "recent observations of the milky way @xcite indicate that its circular velocity is nearly constant to a radius of @xmath314 kpc , and falls slowly like @xmath315 between @xmath316 and 60 kpc , where @xmath317 .",

    "we still need an estimate of how @xmath226 behaves at @xmath323 kpc in order to do the integral ( [ vesc_est ] )",
    ". the most radical assumption would be that there is no more mass beyond this radius , so that @xmath226 drops like @xmath324 beyond this point .",
    "however , the appearance of the rotation curve at the highest measured radii does not suggest such a change ; moreover we have an estimate of the total mass of the galaxy through its virial mass @xmath255 , determined to be @xmath325 in ref .",
    "therefore it would seem reasonable to assume that @xmath310 continues to grow with the same power law @xmath326 out to a radius that contains @xmath255 , after which it stops growing . in the present case that radius corresponds to @xmath327 kpc .",
    "we therefore take @xmath328 as our estimate of where @xmath310 ceases to grow . in the region",
