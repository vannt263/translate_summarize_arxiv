    "@xcite found that the minimum reddening towards the progenitor of sn  2012aw was significantly larger than the reddening inferred towards the subsequent sn , suggesting circumstellar dust around the progenitor was destroyed in the explosion . in the likely event that the progenitor of sn  2012ec suffers from greater extinction than inferred from post - explosion observations of the sn , our inferred mass range translates to a lower mass limit for the progenitor of @xmath70 .",
