    "the technique of terahertz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) has seen wide application in recent years . by resolving carrier dynamics on ultra - short time",
    "scales thz - tds has proven invaluable in areas of physics as disparate as investigating the energy gap in high t@xmath3 superconductors@xcite , determining low - energy vibrational modes in oligomers@xcite , and observing the onset of quasi - particle screening in gaas@xcite .",
    "such studies have become possible through the development of large bandwidth , high power thz emission sources based on the ultra - fast separation of photoexcited carriers in semiconductors .",
    "the resulting change in current produces an electromagnetic transient , typically a single or half - cycle pulse , with a broad spectrum covering thz frequencies .",
    "charge separation can be the result of differing electron and hole mobilities ( the photo - dember effect ) , or alternatively may result from an electric field accelerating electrons and holes in opposite directions . in the later case ,",
    "the electric field can be internal , such as the surface depletion field near a semiconductor surface , or externally applied as in a photoconductive switch ( pcs ) .",
    "the study of surface emitters can help to elucidate aspects of ultra - fast carrier dynamics , such as the enhancement of thz emission under a magnetic field @xcite , and the relative importance of the photo - dember and surface field charge separation mechanisms in gaas and inas @xcite .",
    "additionally , surface emitters can produce the well - collimated thz beams @xcite desirable for many thz imaging applications .    in the effort to improve thz emitters , one method for achieving a greater bandwidth",
    "is to shorten the electric field rise time , normally limited by the duration of the exciting infrared pulse .",
    "another approach is to reduce the duration of the electric field transient after excitation by choosing a semiconductor with a short carrier lifetime , and/or a high momentum scattering rate .",
    "one suitable material is low - temperature - grown ( or lt- ) gaas , in which as precipitates and trapping centres result in a short ( @xmath4ps ) carrier lifetime , enabling thz emission extending to over @xmath5thz @xcite .",
    "alternatively the technique of ion implantation can be used , in which incident energetic ions damage the crystal structure of a semiconductor . the principal defect in arsenic ion - implanted gaas ( gaas : as@xmath6 )",
    "is thought to be the antisite donor defect as@xmath7 , where as replaces ga on some ga lattice sites .",
    "deep - level transient spectroscopy has found that the defect energy levels in gaas : as@xmath6 lay @xmath80.3ev below the conduction band@xcite . such deep - level defects can decrease thz pulse duration ( increase thz bandwidth ) by acting as carrier trapping and scattering centres , and result in carrier lifetimes of the order of @xmath9ps @xcite .",
    "the controllable ion dosage permits ion - implanted gaas samples with reproducible properties , in contrast to lt - gaas where the difficulty of temperature control results in samples with nominally the same growth parameters having varying properties .",
    "ion - implantation has the further advantage of generating depth - dependent damage profiles ( by choosing the ion type , dose , and energy ) in specific sample areas . by performing a post - implant anneal the resistivity of gaas :",
    "as@xmath6 can be increased to levels comparable to lt - gaas @xcite , as required for photoconductive switches .",
    "both surface field@xcite and photoconductive antenna@xcite ion - implanted thz emitters have been previously studied , and were found to produce thz radiation at slightly higher frequencies than semi - insulating gaas@xcite .",
