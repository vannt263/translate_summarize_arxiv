    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are currently believed to be a major source of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) from the arguments of energetics , shock acceleration mechanisms ( blandford & eichler @xcite , jones & ellison @xcite ) , and the elemental abundances in the source of gcr ( yanagita et al .",
    "@xcite , yanagita & nomoto @xcite ) .",
    "egret observations suggest that the acceleration sites of gcrs at gev energies are snrs ( esposito et al .",
    "@xcite ) . however , direct evidence for the sn origin of gcrs at tev energies is scarce ( e.g.  koyama et al .",
    "@xcite , allen et al .",
    "@xcite , buckley et al .",
    "arguably the best evidence for the existence of relativistic electrons with energies around 100 tev is the cangaroo observation of tev gamma - rays from the northeast rim of sn1006 , which coincides with the region of maximum flux in the 210 kev band of the asca data ( tanimori et al .",
    "this tev gamma - ray emission was explained as arising from 2.7k cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons being inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattered by electrons with energies up to @xmath1 100 tev and allowed , together with the observation of non - thermal radio and x - ray emission , the estimation of the physical parameters of the remnant , such as the magnetic field strength ( pohl @xcite , mastichiadis @xcite , mastichiadis & de jager @xcite , yoshida & yanagita @xcite , naito et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    the shell type snr rxj1713.7@xmath03946 was discovered in the rosat all - sky survey ( pfeffermann & aschenbach @xcite ) .",
    "the remnant has a slightly elliptical shape with a maximum extent of @xmath10 .",
    "the 0.12.4 kev x - ray flux from the whole remnant is @xmath1 4.4 @xmath4 10@xmath11 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 ranking it among the brightest galactic supernova remnants .",
    "subsequent observations of this remnant by the asca galactic plane survey revealed strong non - thermal hard x - ray emission from the northwest ( nw ) rim of the remnant that is three times brighter than that from sn1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "the non - thermal emission from the nw rim dominates the x - ray emission from rxj1713.7@xmath03946 , and the snr x - ray emission as a whole is dominated by non - thermal emission ( slane et al .",
    "@xcite , tomida @xcite ) .",
    "it is notable that the observed emission region of hard x - rays extends over an area @xmath12 in diameter .",
    "slane et al .",
    "( @xcite ) carried out 843 mhz radio observations using the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope , and discovered faint emission which extends along most of the snr perimeter , with the most distinct emission from the region bright in x - rays .",
    "slane et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggest the distance to rxj1713.7@xmath03946 is about 6 kpc based upon the observation of co emission from molecular clouds which are likely to be associated with the remnant .",
    "the dominance of non - thermal emission from the shell is reminiscent of sn1006 .",
    "koyama et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed from the global similarity of the new remnant to sn1006 in its shell type morphology , the non - thermal nature of the x - ray emission , and apparent lack of central engine like a pulsar , that rxj1713.7@xmath03946 is the second example , after sn1006 , of synchrotron x - ray radiation from a shell type snr .",
    "these findings from x - ray observations would suggest that tev gamma - ray emission could be expected , as observed in sn1006 , from regions in the remnant extended over an area larger than the point spread function of a typical imaging telescope ( @xmath13.2 ) .",
    "both sn1006 and rxj1713.7@xmath03946 show notably lower radio flux densities and relatively lower matter densities in their ambient space when compared with those for the other shell type snrs ( green @xcite ) for which the whipple group ( buckley et al .",
    "@xcite ) and cangaroo group ( rowell et al .",
    "@xcite ) have reported upper limits to the tev gamma - ray emission .",
    "these characteristics might be related to the reason why tev gamma - rays have been detected only for sn1006 and not from other shell type snrs : the lower radio flux may indicate a weaker magnetic field which may result in a higher electron energies due to reduced synchrotron losses .",
    "in addition , the lower matter density would suppress the production of @xmath14 decay gamma - rays .",
    "an observation of tev gamma - rays from rxj1713.7@xmath03946 would provide not only further direct evidence for the existence of very high energy electrons accelerated in the remnant but also other important information on some physical parameters such as the strength of the magnetic field which are relevant to the particle acceleration phenomena occurring in the remnant , and would also help clarify the reason why tev gamma - rays have until now been detected only from sn1006 .    with the above motivation , we have observed rxj1713.7@xmath03946 with the cangaroo imaging tev gamma - ray telescope in 1998 . here we report the result of these observations .",
    "the cangaroo 3.8 m imaging tev gamma - ray telescope is located near woomera , south australia ( 136@xmath1547e , 31@xmath1506 s ) ( hara et al .",
    "a high resolution camera of 256 photomultiplier tubes ( hamamatsu r2248 ) is installed in the focal plane .",
    "the field of view of each tube is about 0@xmath15.12 @xmath4 0@xmath15.12 , and the total field of view ( fov ) of the camera is about 3@xmath15 .",
    "the pointing accuracy of the telescope is @xmath16 , determined from a study of the trajectories of stars of magnitude 5 to 6 in the fov .",
    "rxj1713.7@xmath03946 was observed in may , june and august in 1998 . during on -",
    "source observations , the center of the fov tracked the nw rim ( right ascension @xmath17 , declination @xmath18 ( j2000 ) ) , which is the brightest point in the remnant in hard x - rays ( koyama et al .",
    "an off - source region having the same declination as the on - source but a different right ascension was observed before or after the on - source observation for equal amounts of time each night under moonless and usually clear sky conditions .",
    "the total observation time was 66 hours for on - source data and 64 hours for off - source data .",
    "after rejecting data affected by clouds , a total of 47.1305 hours for on - source data and 45.8778 hours for off - source data remained for this analysis .",
    "the standard method of image analysis was applied for these data which is based on the well - known parameterization of the elongated shape of the erenkov light images using `` _ width_,''``_length_,''``_concentration _ '' ( shape ) , `` _ distance _ '' ( location ) , and the image orientation angle `` _ alpha _ '' ( hillas @xcite , weekes et al .",
    "@xcite , reynolds et al .",
    "however , the emitting region of tev gamma - rays in this target may be extended , as in the case of sn1006 . for extended sources ,",
    "use of the same criteria as for a point source in the shower image analysis is not necessarily optimal .",
    "we made a careful monte carlo simulation for extended sources of various extents and found the distribution of the shower image parameter of _ width _ , _ length _ , and _ concentration _ for gamma - ray events is essentially the same within a statistical fluctuation as in the case of a point source .",
    "however , the simulation suggests that we should allow a wider range dependent on the extent of the source for the parameter of _ distance _ and _ alpha _ to avoid overcutting gamma - ray events . in this analysis , gamma - ray  like events",
    "were selected with the criteria of 0.@xmath1501 @xmath19 _ width _",

    ".    figure  [ alpha]a shows the resultant _ alpha _ distribution when we analyzed the distribution centered at the tracking point ( right ascension @xmath17 , declination @xmath18 ( j2000 ) ) , which is the brightest point in the remnant in hard x - rays ( koyama et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the solid line and the dashed line indicate the on - source and off - source data respectively . here",
    "we have normalized the off - source data to the on - source data to take into account the difference in observation time and the variation of trigger rates due to the difference in zenith angle between on- and off - source data and due to subtle changes in weather conditions .",
    "the value of the normalization factor @xmath20 is estimated to be 1.03 from the difference in total obsevation time for on- and off - source measurements .",
    "on the other hand , the actual value of the normalization factor @xmath20 is estimated to be @xmath21 from the ratio of @xmath22/@xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath23 indicate the total number of gamma - ray - like events with _ alpha _ between 40@xmath15 and 90@xmath15 for on- and off - source data respectively .",
    "we selected the region with _ alpha _",
    "@xmath25 40@xmath15 to avoid any `` contamination '' by gamma - rays from the source , in the knowledge that the source may be extended .",
    "the small discrepancy in the two estimates of the value @xmath20 might come from a slight change in the mirror reflectivity during the observation due to dew .",
    "here we adopt the value 0.99 for @xmath20 in the following analysis by taking the small discrepancy into the systematic errors due to the uncertainty in the mirror reflectivity as shown below .",
    "figure  [ alpha]b shows the _ alpha _ distribution of the excess events for the on - source over the off - source distribution shown in figure  [ alpha]a .",
    "a rather broad but significant peak can be seen at low _ alpha _ , extending to @xmath26 .",
    "the _ alpha _ distributions expected for a point source and several disk - like extended sources of uniform surface brightness with various radii centered at our fov were calculated using the monte carlo method .",
    "these distributions are shown in the same figure .",
    "the _ alpha _ distribution of the observed excess events appears to favour a source radius of @xmath12 , which suggests the emitting region of tev gamma - rays is extended around the nw rim of rxj1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "the statistical significance of the excess is calculated by ( @xmath27 ) / @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the numbers of gamma - ray  like events with _ alpha _ less than @xmath31 in the on- and off - source data respectively .",
    "the significance at the peak of the x - ray maximum was @xmath32 when we chose a value of _ alpha _ @xmath33 considering the result of the monte carlo simulation shown in figure  [ alpha]b .    in order to verify this extended nature , we examined the effects of the cut in shape parameters on the _ alpha _ distribution by varying each cut parameter over wide ranges .",
    "we also produced _ alpha _ distributions for different energy ranges and data sub - sets .",
    "similar broad peaks in the _ alpha _ distribution persisted through these examinations .",
    "also we examined more recent data from psr1706@xmath044 from july and august 1998 and obtained a narrow peak at _ alpha _ @xmath34 , as expected for a point source .",
    "this confirms that the extended nature of the tev gamma - ray emitting region does not come from some malfunction of our telescope system and/or systematic errors in our data analysis .",
    "a similar , but not as broad , _ alpha _ peak was seen for sn1006 ( tanimori et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to see the extent of the emitting region",
    ", we made a significance map of the excess events around the nw rim of rxj1713.7@xmath03946 .",
    "significances for _ alpha _ @xmath35 were calculated at all grid points in @xmath36 steps in the fov .",
    "figure  [ map - add ] shows the resultant significance map of the excess events around the nw rim of rxj1713.7@xmath03946 plotted as a function of right ascension and declination , in which the contours of the hard x - ray flux ( tomida @xcite ) are overlaid as solid lines .",
    "the solid circle indicates the size of the point spread function ( psf ) of our telescope which is estimated to have a standard deviation of @xmath37 for _ alpha _ @xmath35 based upon monte carlo simulations for a point source with a gaussian function .",
    "the area which shows the highest significance in our tev gamma - ray observation coincides almost exactly with the brightest area in hard x - rays .",
    "the region which shows the emission of tev gamma - rays with high significance ( @xmath38 level ) extends wider than our psf and appears to coincide with the ridge of the nw rim that is bright in hard x - rays .",
    "it extends over a region with a radius of @xmath39 .",
    "this region persisted in similar maps calculated for several values of _ alpha _ narrower than @xmath33",
    ".    the integral flux of tev gamma - rays was calculated , assuming emission from a point source , to be ( 5.3 @xmath3 0.9 [ statistical ] @xmath3 1.6 [ systematic ] ) @xmath4 10@xmath5 photons @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( @xmath8 1.8 @xmath3 0.9 tev ) .",
    "the flux value and the statistical error were estimated from the excess number of @xmath40 , where the value of @xmath33 for _ alpha _ is chosen by the argument mentioned before .",
    "the causes of the systematic errors are categorized by uncertainties in ( a ) assumed differential spectral index , ( b ) the loss of gamma - ray events due to the parameter cuts , ( c ) the estimate of core distance of showers by the monte carlo method , ( d ) the trigger condition , ( e ) the conversion factor of the adc counts to the number of photo - electrons , and ( f ) the reflectivity of the reflector .",
    "these errors from ( a ) to ( f ) are estimated as 15% , 22% , 3% , 12% , 10% , and 8% for the integral flux and 24% , 2% , 8% , 20% , 29% , and 17% for the threshold energy , respectively .",
    "the total systematic errors shown above are obtained by adding those errors quadratically .",
    "to summarise , all our observed data support the hypothesis that the emitting region of the nw rim is extended . in general",
    ", the value of the effective detection area of the telescope system for extended sources would be reduced by some factor from that for a point source , because the gamma - ray detection efficiency decreases with the distance of emitting points from the center of the fov when we observe with a single dish .",
    "we calculated the efficiency as a function of the distance by the monte carlo method by analyzing the data with the same criteria as applied to the actual data .",
    "we estimated the value of the correction factor to the effective area to be @xmath41 for our target by integrating the efficiency over the distance for an extended disk - like source of uniform surface brightness with a radius of @xmath42 .",
    "the factor of 1.2 is less significant than the systematic errors estimated above .",
    "the snr rxj1713.7@xmath03946 is reminiscent of sn1006 both in the synchrotron x - ray emission from the shell far from the centre of the remnant and also in the tev gamma - ray emission from an extended region coincident with that of the non - thermal x - rays .",
    "this suggests that the particles responsible for the emission of the high energy photons are accelerated in shocks .",
    "there are several possible emission processes of tev gamma - rays : the emission induced by accelerated protons ( by the @xmath14 decay process ) and by electrons  through bremsstrahlung and/or the inverse compton ( ic ) process .",
    "the expected integral flux of gamma - rays above our threshold energy of @xmath43 tev by the @xmath14 decay process is estimated to be @xmath44 photons @xmath6 s@xmath7 ( drury et al .",
    "@xcite , naito & takahara @xcite ) , where we assume the distance and the upper limit for the number density in the ambient space of the remnant as 6 kpc and 0.28 atoms/@xmath45 , respectively ( slane et al .",
    "this flux value is too low to explain our observed flux , even taking into account the large uncertainties in the estimates of the distance and the ambient matter density of the remnant ( slane et al .",
    "@xcite , tomida @xcite ) .",
    "however , there remains the possibility of some contribution of the @xmath14 decay process if the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud located near the nw rim ( slane et al .",
    "the relative contribution in emissivity of the bremsstrahlung process compared to @xmath14 decay process is estimated as @xmath46 % , assuming the flux ratio of electrons to protons is @xmath47 and that both have power law spectra with the index of 2.4 ( gaisser @xcite ) , indicating this process is also unlikely to dominate .",
    "therefore , the most likely process for tev gamma - ray emission seems to be the ic process .    under this assumption",
    ", the magnetic field strength in the supernova remnant can be deduced from the relation @xmath48 between the ic luminosity @xmath49 and synchrotron luminosity @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the energy densities of the magnetic field and the target photon field , respectively . @xmath50 and @xmath49 in the above formula must be due to electrons in the same energy range .",
    "the value of @xmath50 which should be compared with our tev gamma - ray data is estimated from the asca result to be @xmath53 /@xmath54 , extrapolating the synchrotron spectrum with the same power law out of the energy range of 0.5@xmath010 kev covered by asca ( tomida @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath55 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 is the x - ray luminosity in the 0.5@xmath010 kev energy band observed by asca from the nw rim of the remnant and the power law index of @xmath56 is the mean value for index of x - rays in the same energy range ( tomida @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath57 kev is a typical synchrotron photon energy emitted by electrons which emit 1.8 tev photons ( the threshold energy of our observation ) by the ic process when we assume the target photons to be from the cmbr .",
    "the value of @xmath49 is calculated to be @xmath58 erg @xmath6 s@xmath7 from our result for the number of photons of tev gamma - rays , and using the fact that the spectra of synchrotron photons and ic photons follow the same power law when the electrons have a power law spectrum . thus inserting @xmath50 , @xmath49 , and @xmath59 erg @xmath60 of the energy density for the cmbr into the above relation",
    ", we can solve for the magnetic field strength @xmath61 .",
    "finally , the magnetic field at the nw rim is estimated to be @xmath62 g .",
    "the extrapolation used to estimate @xmath50 is reasonable , because @xmath63 is estimated to be 0.15 kev ; this is not so different from the minimum energy of the asca band ( 0.5 kev ) .",
    "the electrons responsible for the synchrotron and ic photon emissions are likely to have been accelerated by the shocks in the remnant as discussed above .",
    "if the maximum electron energy is limited by synchrotron losses , this maximum energy can be estimated by equating the cooling time due to synchrotron losses with the time scale of acceleration by the first fermi process in a strong shock as @xmath64 tev , where v@xmath65 is the shock velocity ( yoshida & yanagita @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , equating the acceleration time with the age of the remnant , the maximum energy can be expressed @xmath66 tev . in either case , whether it is synchrotron losses or the age of the remnant that limits the maximum electron energy ( reynolds & keohane @xcite ) , electrons should exist with energies high enough to emit the observed synchrotron x - rays and tev gamma - rays by the ic process .",
    "it is notable that both rxj1713.7@xmath03946 and sn1006 have relatively low magnetic field strengths and low matter densities in their ambient space .",
    "these common features may have arisen if the magnetic field was ` frozen in ' to the matter without amplification other than by compression by shocks and may be the reason why electrons are accelerated to such high energies .",
    "these facts may also explain the radio quietness ( green @xcite ) and the weak emissivity of @xmath14 decay gamma - rays of the remnants . for sn1006",
    ", the low matter density in the ambient space might result from the remnant being located far off the galactic plane and the supernova being of type ia .",
    "for rxj1713.7@xmath03946 , the low matter density may be caused by material having been swept out by the stellar wind of the supernova progenitor ( slane et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the low magnetic field and the low matter density in the ambient space of sn1006 and rxj1713.7@xmath03946 may explain why tev gamma - rays have been detected so far only for these two remnants .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have found evidence for tev gamma - ray emission from rxj1713.7@xmath03946 at the level of 5.6 sigma .",
    "if confirmed (  la weekes @xcite ) , this would be the second case after sn1006 to show directly that particles are accelerated up to energies of @xmath67 tev in the shell type snr .",
