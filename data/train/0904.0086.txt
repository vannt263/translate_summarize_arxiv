    "the spin degree of freedom of spinor bose - einstein condensates  @xcite leads to a wealth of new phenomena not possessed by single - component ( spin - frozen ) condensates .",
    "new spin - induced dynamics such as spin waves  @xcite , spin - mixing  @xcite and spin textures  @xcite have all been predicted and observed .",
    "these spin - dependent phenomena are possible due to the development of optical traps  @xcite which trap all spin components , rather than just the low - magnetic - field seeking spin states of magnetic traps .",
    "however , the effect of an additional small non - zero magnetic field on the condensate in these optical traps was studied even in the seminal theoretical  @xcite and experimental  @xcite works .",
    "in fact the interplay of spin and magnetic field has been at the heart of some of the most impressive spinor bec experiments , including the demonstration of spin domains  @xcite , spin oscillations  @xcite and spin textures and vortices  @xcite .",
    "a spin-1 spinor bec in a magnetic field is subjected to the well - known zeeman effect . at low fields",
    "the effect is dominated by the linear zeeman effect , which leads to a larmor precession of the spin about the magnetic field which is unaffected by spatial inhomogeneities in the condensate  @xcite . at higher magnetic fields",
    "the quadratic zeeman effect becomes important , and this can lead to much more dramatic effects in the condensate , such as coherent population exchange between spin components  @xcite and the breaking of the single - mode approximation ( sma )  @xcite .",
    "the study of the behaviour of a spin-1 condensate in the presence of a homogenous magnetic field began with the work of stenger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where the global ground state in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic condensates was found to be free of spin domains .",
    "it was later found that the ground state under the constraint of fixed magnetization was significantly different to the global ground state and even broke the sma in a harmonic trap  @xcite .",
    "the sma continued to be used for a homogenous condensate in a homogenous magnetic field , leading to the discovery that both phase - matched and anti - phase - matched states could exist in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic condensates  @xcite .",
    "dynamical instability was found to occur in ferromagnetic condensates in nonzero magnetic field , leading to the formation of spin domains  @xcite while no spin domain formation was predicted to occur  @xcite or observed  @xcite in antiferromagnetic condensates .",
    "it seemed that spin domains in antiferromagnetic condensates were only to be found in the presence of inhomogenous magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown that , contrary to the common belief , antiferromagnetic spin-1 condensates may exhibit spin domain formation in a homogenous magnetic field  @xcite , provided the condensate is larger than the spin healing length .",
    "in fact , we found that for a homogenous antiferromagnetic bec with nonzero magnetization _ all states are unstable_. the form of the ground state in this case was therefore unknown .    in this work",
    "we resolve the ground state phase diagram of a spin-1 condensate in the absence of a trapping potential .",
    "we show that the translational symmetry of a homogenous bec is spontaneously broken and phase separation occurs in magnetized polar condensates if the magnetic field is strong enough .",
    "an analogous phenomenon has been predicted and observed previously in binary condensates @xcite .",
    "to explain the physics behind phase separation and determine the conditions for it to occur , we analyze the excitation spectrum of the internal spin degree of freedom of a homogenous condensate .",
    "in contrast to spatial excitations of the condensate , which have the form of sound waves or phonons @xcite , we analyze the case when the spin - dependent energy , but not the kinetic energy , is increased with respect to the ground state @xcite .",
    "next , we show that for a range of experimental conditions , it is energetically favorable for the system to consist of two separate phases composed of different stationary states .",
    "we demonstrate numerically that this phenomenon can be observed in a polar condensate trapped in a harmonic optical potential .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the relevance of these results is not obvious in the case of harmonic trapping , since the coefficient @xmath175 , one of the main parameters controlling the condensate properties , varies in space due to the varying total density @xmath64 .",
    "na condensate when the magnetic field strength is increased from ( a ) @xmath176 g , @xmath177 to ( b ) @xmath178 g , @xmath179 and ( c ) @xmath180 g , @xmath181 .",
    "for comparison , the ground state of a @xmath46rb condensate is shown in ( d ) for @xmath182 g , @xmath183 .",
    "the @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 components are depicted by dash - dotted , dashed , and dotted lines , respectively .",
    "the solid lines shows the total density .",
    "other parameters are @xmath184 , @xmath185 ( @xmath0na ) , @xmath186 ( @xmath46rb ) , @xmath187 and @xmath153.,width=321 ]    the ground states in a highly elongated harmonic trap , where the parallel part of the potential has the form @xmath188 , are presented in fig .  [ profiles ] .",
    "we can see that as the magnetic field strength is increased , phase separation occurs and the @xmath189 domain state is formed .",
    "however , in contrast to the previous case , the transition is not sharp , and in particular there is no distinct @xmath190 phase for any value of the magnetic field .",
    "note that the state in fig .",
    "[ profiles](a ) is also spatially separated due to different thomas - fermi radii of the @xmath63 and @xmath60 components ; however , this is an example of potential separation , as opposed to phase separation  @xcite , since it is does not occur in the absence of the potential . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ profiles](d ) shows that the components of ferromagnetic condensate are miscible even in the regime of strong magnetic field . in the regions where the wavefunctions overlap , the relative phase is equal to @xmath94 for ferromagnetic and @xmath98 for polar ground states , since these configurations minimize the spin energy  ( [ ea3 ] ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of phase separation in the polar bec is that the @xmath69 domain tends to be localized in the center of the trap , as shown in fig .",
    "[ domains](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this can be explained by calculating the total asymmetric energy of the condensate ( [ ea2 ] ) , again assuming that the contribution from the intermediate region connecting the domains is negligible , @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the mean condensate density within the area of the @xmath118 domain .",
    "we see that the energy will be the lowest if this domain is localized in the outer regions , where the condensate density is low .",
    "our results presented above show that the domain structure forming in polar condensates is absent in ferromagnetic becs .",
    "this may seem to contradict the common understanding of ferromagnetism and the results of the quenched bec experiment ref .",
    "the conventional picture of a ferromagnet involves many domains pointing in various directions separated by domain walls .",
    "similar structure has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , these cases correspond to the situations when there is an excess kinetic energy present in the system , due to finite temperature or excitation of the spatial modes . on the other hand ,",
    "our study is limited to the ground states at @xmath193 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ ea3 ] ) that in zero magnetic field the ground state of a ferromagnetic bec will always consist of a single domain with maximum possible value of the spin vector @xmath137 , pointing in the same direction at all points in space .",
    "however , when the temperature is finite , more domains can be formed each with a different direction of the spin vector .",
    "we emphasize that the domain structure of the ground state in polar condensates is very different from the domains formed when the kinetic energy is injected in the system as in ref .",
    "the latter constantly appear and disappear in a random sequence  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the ground state domains are stationary and are positioned in the center of the trap .",
    "they exist in the lowest - energy state , while the dynamical domains require an amount of kinetic energy to be formed .",
    "the ground state domains can be prepared in an adiabatic process , involving adiabatic rf sweep or a slow change of the magnetic field  @xcite , while the kinetic domains require a sudden quench  @xcite .",
    "the dynamical instability of ferromagnetic condensates that leads to spontaneous formation of spin domains has been investigated theoretically  @xcite and observed in experiment  @xcite .",
    "an analogous phenomenon has been predicted recently for polar condensates in presence of magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "here we correct the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , by noting that the @xmath68 state is stable in ferromagnetic condensates for @xmath194 , and the 2c ( @xmath78 ) state is stable in polar becs if @xmath195 .",
    "both states become the ground states for these values of parameters . by investigating stability in various ranges of parameters , we are able to formulate a phenomenological law governing the dynamical stability of condensates :    1 .",
    "the only stable state for both polar and ferromagnetic becs in finite magnetic field is the ground state , as shown in table  [ tgs ] .",
    "2 .   in zero magnetic field ,",
    "the same is true for ferromagnetic condensates ; however , all stationary states of polar condensates are dynamically stable in zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the reason for the stability of polar condensates in vanishing magnetic field case is not yet clear .",
    "we note that the polar condensates in weak magnetic field may also be effectively stable on a finite time scale . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in this latter case the instability growth rate of unstable modes is proportional to the fourth power of the magnetic field strength .",
    "the time required for the development of instability may be much longer than the condensate lifetime  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the ground state of a spin-1 bec in the presence of a homogenous magnetic field with and without an external trapping potential .",
    "we have found that without a trapping potential the translational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in polar bec , with the formation of spin domains in the ground state .",
    "we have determined the ground - state phase diagram in the space of magnetization versus magnetic field divided by density , and demonstrated the different phases , each characterized by the type of nonvanishing components .",
    "we have found good agreement between the numerical calculation of the phase diagram and the analytical predictions based on the homogenous states .",
    "we have shown that these results may be used to understand the ground state structure in the presence of a trapping potential by mapping the locally varying density in the trap to the homogenous state .",
    "we have found that , depending on the magnetic field , the antiferromagnetic bec ground state in the trap displays pronounced spin domains for a range of possible experimental conditions . finally , we have discussed the relationship between the phenomenon of phase separation and the dynamical instability leading to the formation of dynamic spin textures .",
