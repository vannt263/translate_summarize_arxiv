    "in the periodic anderson model ( pam ) there are four local states at each site @xmath5 of the lattice ( identified by a single index in this work ) : the vacuum state  @xmath6 , the two states @xmath7 of one electron with spin component @xmath8 and the state @xmath9 with two local electrons @xcite .  in the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion @xmath0 ,",
    "the state @xmath9 is empty , and we shall use the hubbard operators @xcite to project it out from the space of local states at site @xmath5 . the hamiltonian of the system is then @xcite : @xmath10    where the first term is the hamiltonian of the conduction electrons ( @xmath11-electrons ) , the second term describes independent localized electrons ( @xmath12-electrons ) , and the last term is the hybridization hamiltonian giving the interaction between the @xmath11-electrons and the @xmath12-electrons .    the @xmath13 hubbard operators do not satisfy the usual commutation relations so that diagrammatic methods based on wick s theorem are not applicable , and one has to use product rules instead:@xmath14 the identity decomposition in the reduced space of local states at site @xmath5 is then@xmath15    where @xmath16 , and the three @xmath17 are the projectors into @xmath18 . because of the translational invariance , the occupation numbers @xmath19  satisfy @xmath20=@xmath21 ( independent of j ) , and from eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) we obtain the `` completeness '' relation @xmath22    the occupation numbers can be calculated from appropriate green s functions ( gf ) , and it has been found that eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) is not usually satisfied when the @xmath21 are calculated with approximate cumulant green s functions ( gf ) @xcite .",
    "an approximation with this behavior is the `` chain approximation '' ( cha ) , which was first obtained by hewson @xcite .",
    "this approximation has interesting properties : it is @xmath23derivable @xcite , and it is also the most general cumulant expansion with only second order cumulants .",
    "we have employed several procedures to restore completeness to the cha : renormalization of the one - electron green s functions ( gf ) or adding diagrams to the gf in the cha .",
    "the second method lead us to a conjecture on a systematic way of achieving completeness by adding a set of diagrams to an arbitrary family @xcite .",
    "an alternative to these techniques was inspired in the mean field treatment of the slave boson technique @xcite , in which the correlated problem is transformed into an uncorrelated one with one condition that forces to zero the occupation of @xmath9 states .",
    "this condition turns out to be just our eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) , and following coleman we minimized the free energy of the system calculated with the cha but forcing the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) , that implies the completeness .",
    "this is the essence of the x - boson method @xcite and , differently from the slave boson treatment , the correlation is kept at the final stage because it is intrinsic to the cha @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this fact is that the spurious phase transition that appears in the slave boson treatment for several regions of the system parameters ( for intermediate temperatures or when @xmath24 ) @xcite , disappears completely from our treatment .",
    "the results of the x - boson method are fairly close to those obtained by the slave boson treatment in the region of its validity , while the x - boson method gives results that are close to those of the cha when the slave boson is not valid any more ( at high temperatures and when @xmath25 ) .",
    "a rather inconvenient aspect of the cha is that its results show a region of instability @xcite , apparent because the dependence of @xmath1 with @xmath2 shows multiple values of @xmath2 for a given @xmath1 within a small interval of values of @xmath1 , and this leads to negative compressibility .",
    "the main result of the present work is to show that this difficulty of the cha is removed by the x - boson treatment , and @xmath4 becomes then a monotonous function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the x - boson approach is presented in section [ x - boson method ] , the gf in the cha are given in section [ cha gfs ] , and in section [ free energy ] we describe the calculation of the free energy .",
    "our results and conclusions are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "in coleman s `` slave boson '' method @xcite , the hubbard x operators are written as a product of ordinary bosons and fermions:@xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and a condition , that is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) , is imposed to avoid states with two electrons at each site @xmath5 . in the spirit of the mean field approximation @xmath29 and the method of lagrangian multipliers",
    "is employed to minimize the free energy subject to that condition .",
    "the problem is then reduced to an uncorrelated anderson lattice with renormalized hybridization @xmath30 and @xmath12 level @xmath31 , and the conservation of probability in the space of local states is automatically satisfied because they are described by fermi operators .",
    "the approximate gf obtained by the cumulant expansion @xcite do not usually conserve probability ( i.e. they do not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) ) , and the procedure we adopt to recover this property in the x - boson method is to introduce @xmath32 as variational parameter , and to modify the approximate gf so that it minimizes an adequate thermodynamic potential while being forced to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) . to this purpose",
    "we add to eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) the product of each eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) into a lagrange multiplier @xmath33 , and employ this new hamiltonian to generate the functional that shall be minimized by employing lagrange s method . to simplify the calculations we use a constant hybridization @xmath34 , as well as site independent local energies @xmath35 and lagrange parameters @xmath36 .",
    "we then obtain a new hamiltonian with the same form of eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) : @xmath37 but with renormalized localized energies@xmath38 the parameter@xmath39 is now varied independently to minimize the thermodynamic potential , choosing @xmath40 so that eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) be satisfied . while at this stage the electrons in the slave boson hamiltonian have lost all the correlations , the eq .",
    "( [ eq.7 ] ) is still in the projected space and it is not necessary to force the correlations with an extra condition . on the other hand we do not have an exact solution for this new problem , and we then consider the most simple approximation obtained within the cumulant formalism , the chain approximation ( cha ) @xcite .",
    "the need of minimizing a thermodynamic potential arises because the completeness relation is not automatically satisfied for approximate cumulant solutions , and although the two procedures are formally very similar , they have a rather different meaning .",
    "the grand canonical ensemble of electrons is employed in the present treatment , and instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) we have to use @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the number of electrons in state @xmath43 .",
    "it is then convenient to define @xmath44 and @xmath45 because @xmath46 and @xmath47 appear only in that form in all the calculations .",
    "the exact and unperturbed averages of the operator @xmath48 are denoted in what follows by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "the gf in the chain approximation ( cha ) are given by @xcite:@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath56 lattice @xmath56 slave - boson @xmath56 gf are recovered@xmath56 if @xmath56 we put @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 in eqs.(12,13,14 ) .",
    "the usual gf for the lattice in the cha are obtained if we use the bare @xmath59 , while @xmath59 must be calculated self - consistently in the x - boson approach .    in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite we considered the atomic limit of the pam , i.e. with a conduction band of zero width , to study both the free energy and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 , but here we shall consider the pam with a wide band .",
    "when the total number of electrons @xmath1 , the temperature @xmath3 and the volume @xmath60 are kept constant the equilibrium state corresponds to a minimum of the helmholtz free energy , but the same state of equilibrium is obtained by minimizing the thermodynamic potential @xmath61 , ( where @xmath62 is the grand partition function ) at constant @xmath3 , @xmath60 , and chemical potential @xmath2 ( this result is easily obtained by employing standard thermodynamic techniques ) .",
    "we shall then employ @xmath63 as the thermodynamic potential that is minimized in the x - boson method with eq .",
    "( [ eq.2 ] ) as constraint .",
    "the helmholtz free energy @xmath64 is then given by@xmath65 and our first step would be the calculation of @xmath63 .    a convenient way to obtain @xmath63 is to employ the method of @xmath66 parameter integration @xcite .",
    "this method introduces a @xmath66 dependent hamiltonian @xmath67 through a coupling constant @xmath68 ( with @xmath69 ) , where @xmath70 is the hybridization in our case .",
    "one obtains @xcite@xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ensemble average of an operator @xmath48 for a system with hamiltonian @xmath73 and the given values of @xmath74 @xmath3 , and @xmath60 , while @xmath75 is the thermodynamic potential of the system with @xmath76 .",
    "this value of @xmath68 corresponds to a system without hybridization , and one obtains ( in the absence of magnetic field @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) @xmath79 \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{n_{s}}{\\beta}\\ln\\left [   1 + 2\\exp(-\\beta\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}% _ { f})\\right ]   + n_{s}\\lambda(r-1 ) , \\label{eqn.16}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and to calculate @xmath63 in eq.([eqn.15 ] ) we use @xmath80",

    "this equation has an interesting scaling property : it is equal to the corresponding expression of the uncorrelated system for the scaled parameter @xmath84 ( it is enough to remember that by replacing @xmath85 in the gf of the cha one obtains the corresponding gf of the uncorrelated system ) . rather than performing the @xmath68 and @xmath86  integrations",
    ", we shall use the value of the @xmath87 for the uncorrelated system with @xmath88 and employ eq .",
    "( [ eqn.15 ] ) to calculate @xmath89 , where @xmath90   + n_{s}\\ln\\left [   1+\\exp ( -\\beta\\widetilde{\\varepsilon}_{f})\\right ]   \\right ]   + n_{s}\\lambda(r-1 ) \\label{eqn.19a}%\\ ] ] is the @xmath87 for @xmath91 .",
    "the uncorrelated hamiltonian for the lattice problem is then@xmath92 and this hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized .",
    "the corresponding @xmath93 can be written @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) are the creation ( destruction ) operators of the composite particles of energies @xmath97 ( there are @xmath98 states for each spin @xmath99 ) .",

    "the @xmath102 can be calculated analytically , because the hamiltonian for each spin component @xmath99 is reduced into @xmath103 matrices @xmath104 , and one finds @xmath105    the parameter @xmath40 is obtained minimizing @xmath106 with respect to @xmath107 @xcite . to simplify the calculations we shall consider a conduction band with a constant density of states , width @xmath108 , an hybridization constant @xmath109 , and @xmath110",
    "; we then obtain @xmath111    all the correlation effects in  eq .",
    "( [ eqn.23 ] ) are included in @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "( 16 ) ) , and the hybridization redistributes the quasi - particle energies in the same way that an uncorrelated system with @xmath84 would do ; one then expects fermi liquid behavior of the quasi - particles @xcite .",
    "employing the cha to calculate the gf of the pam one discovers an undesirable feature in several regions of the parameter space and for sufficiently low @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "when the total number of particles in the system @xmath1 is plotted against the chemical potential @xmath2 one finds that there are three possible values of @xmath2  for each @xmath1 in an interval of @xmath1 ,  originating an instability in a small interval of @xmath2 , characterized by a negative derivative of @xmath1 with respect of @xmath2 .",
    "the problem was first observed in a wide conduction band , but further analysis was done for a band of zero width @xcite , because one could then obtain an exact solution of the problem and compare with the approximate result .",
    "the value of the free energy @xmath64 was then calculated for the three states to analyze their relative stability . here",
    "we shall consider the problem for a wide conduction band , and compare the results of the x - boson with those obtained with the cha and with the slave - boson .",
    "the main result of the present work is that the x - boson does not present the multiple solutions of the cha .    in figure  [ figrede1 ]",
    "we plot @xmath4 for cha , slave boson and x - boson for the same parameters used in @xcite .",
    "the multiple solutions of the cha are apparent , as well as the thermodynamically unstable region ( part b - c of the fig .",
    "[ figrede1 ] , where @xmath1 decreases when @xmath2 increases ) , i.e. the same behavior that was observed for the atomic limit of the pam @xcite .",
    "the problem of thermodynamic unstable solutions does not appear in the slave boson and x - boson , but the slave boson breaks down at higher @xmath2 ( @xmath112 , magnetic regime ) while the x - boson presents a continuous evolution in all regimes of the model .      in figure [ figrede2 ] we present the helmholtz free energy @xmath64 vs. @xmath1 in the slave boson , x - boson , and cha approximations .",
    "the cha present three values of free energy @xmath64 for the same @xmath1 that have three values of @xmath113 , while this problem is absent in the x - boson and slave boson methods .      in figure [ figrede3 ]",
    "we plot the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath63 vs. @xmath1 for the slave boson and x - boson,@xmath56 at two values of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath56 in this plot the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath63 for the slave boson is always lower or equal than for the x - boson , and its values increase with temperature in the two methods ; its minimum values are in the kondo region at the lowest @xmath114 the values of @xmath63  are different at the larger value of @xmath3 for all @xmath1 .      in figure [ figrede4 ] we show that @xmath115 has multiple values for the cha at @xmath116 and @xmath117 when @xmath118 , while that behavior is absent at higher @xmath3 . note that there is no minimum of @xmath63 in the cha , and that this quantity changes with @xmath1 between maximum and minimum values that are independent of @xmath3 .          in figure [ figrede6 ]",
    "we plot @xmath119 ( the density of states @xmath12 on the fermi level @xmath120 vs. @xmath1 for the x - boson and slave boson at @xmath116 , the lower value of temperature that we consider in figure [ figrede3 ] . from this figure is clear that the kondo effect is present when @xmath121 where @xmath119 has a maximum in the two approaches .",
    "some years ago we studied the thermodynamic properties of the cha @xcite , an approximation that was obtained by employing a diagrammatic cumulant expansion for the pam .",
    "we then found that for a region of the system parameters at very low temperatures , there are three states with different chemical potential @xmath2 for the same total number of electrons @xmath1 .",
    "we observed that one of these states is thermodynamically unstable ( part b - c of the fig .",

    "the x - boson is essentially a generalized cha approximation which satisfies completeness through a minimization of the thermodynamic potential as a function of the average occupation of the empty state while keeping eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) as a constraint . as it is shown in figure ( [ figrede1 ] )",
    "this approach does not present thermodynamically unstable states or multiple solutions for a given @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude that the x - boson combines the simplicity and usefulness of the cha and slave boson methods , without their more obvious defects : the presence of spurious phase transitions of the slave boson and the absence of kondo resonance , of multiple solutions and instabilities , as well as the failure to satisfy completeness of the cha ."
