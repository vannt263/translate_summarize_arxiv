    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite probes the neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles  @xcite , but leaves open the issue of what is the absolute scale of neutrino mass .",
    "the latter has important cosmological implications in the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure in the universe , as already indicated by the sensitivities reached , for example , by the recent wmap-3  @xcite , the 2df galaxy redshift survey  @xcite and sloan digital sky survey results  @xcite .",
    "one expects even better sensitivities in the next generation of cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "interesting as these may be , there are essentially only two ways to get insight into the absolute scale of neutrino mass in the laboratory : searches for neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite and investigations of the beta spectra near their endpoints @xcite . for the latter direct search for the neutrino mass",
    "a very low beta endpoint is crucial : tritium was used in the most sensitive spectrometer experiments @xcite and rhenium in the up - coming cryobolometer experiments @xcite .",
    "currently a next generation tritium beta - decay experiment is being prepared , scaling up the size and precision of previous experiments by an order of magnitude , and increasing the intensity of the tritium beta source : the karlruhe tritium neutrino experiment katrin  @xcite .",
    "such an improved sensitivity experiment will probe neutrino masses ten times smaller than the current limits and therefore play a crucial role in probing for direct effects of neutrino masses .",
    "prompted by the prospects that high sensitivities can be achieved in the next generation of high precision neutrino mass searches from tritium beta decay experiments  @xcite we reexamine the accuracy of the kinematical formulae used in the determination of neutrino masses from the shape of the endpoint spectrum .",
    "we also discuss the interplay of neutrino oscillation data and the expectations for the beta decay endpoint counting rates for the different types of neutrino mass spectra .",
    "in what follows we label the relativistic momenta and energies involved in tritium beta decay according to @xmath0 the masses of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively . in order to see the convenience of an exact relativistic description we mention , as recently noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the well known relativistic formula for the maximum electron energy @xmath7,\\ ] ] gives a value about 3.4 ev lower than the approximation @xmath8 often used .",
    "this suggests the desirability of carrying out the full phase space integration using relativistic kinematics .",
    "start from the standard formula for the decay width at rest , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the spin - summed , lorentz invariant `` squared '' amplitude . to explore the constraint of lorentz invariance one might a priori consider expanding @xmath10 in terms of invariants constructed from the four - momenta .",
