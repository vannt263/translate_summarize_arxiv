    "the recent interest in aspects common to quantum information and condensed matter  @xcite has prompted a florishing activity at the border of these disciplines , quite distinct until few years ago .",
    "it is hard to list all the numerous problems addressed so far .",
    "here we only mention the study of entanglement in quantum critical systems ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) , and the recent advances relating to the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , as they are tightly connected to the present work .",
    "in fact in this paper we apply the recently developed time dependent dmrg ( t - dmrg )  @xcite to the study of the dynamics of entanglement entropy in heisenberg chains .    among all the various ways to quantify entanglement here we consider the block entropy which has recently analyzed in several different situations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that the entropy of a block of spins @xmath0 in the ground state of a spin chains is very sensitive to its critical properties . in the case of a block with one boundary with the rest of the chain @xmath0 , for @xmath1 , diverges at the critical point as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory ( cft ) of the model considered .",
    "in contrast in non critical systems the entropy saturates to the finite value @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the correlation length @xcite . in the presence of quenched disorder the properties of the block entropy for critical chains remain remarkably universal . for the models analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite using real - space renormalization group , it still diverges logarithmically with a `` renormalized '' central charge @xmath6  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the central charge of the corresponding pure model .",
    "it has been conjectured that such an effective central charge characterizes generically the critical systems with quenched disorder @xcite .",
    "the interest in the properties of entanglement in condensed matter has also extended to understand its dynamical behaviour . like for the case of propagation of excitations in condensed media",
    ", it recently became of interest to know how entanglement could propagate through spin chains .",
    "this question was studied by looking at two - particle  @xcite and many - particle entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement was studied either by preparing the system in a state ( not an eigenstate ) with all the entanglement localized in a given part of the chain or after a sudden quench of some of the couplings of the model hamiltonian .    in this paper we consider static and dynamical properties of the entropy of a block of spins for an anisotropic heisenberg chain both in the clean and in the disordered case .",
    "we investigate the problem by means of dmrg  @xcite for the static part @xcite and its time - dependent version  @xcite for the dynamical evolution .",
    "the static entropy of the heisenberg model was considered numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite and some exact results are known in the isotropic ferromagnetic limit  @xcite and in the xx and ising limits @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider again this case for completeness .",
    "in addition it serves as an important check for the other cases considered ( see sections [ staticclean ] , [ dynamicclean ] , [ staticdisordered ] , [ dynamicdisordered ] ) for which these are , to the best of our knowledge , the first numerical calculations available for the heisenberg model . the results of the dynamics of an ordered chains are compared with the cft results of ref .  @xcite . in the static disordered case",
    "we confirm the prediction of  @xcite .",
    "section [ dynamicdisordered ] is devoted to the dynamics of a disordered heisenberg chain . here",
    "we predict a slow evolution for the dynamics of entanglement which hints at some sort of entanglement localization .",
    "the model that we consider is a spin chain of length @xmath7 with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions described by the heisenberg hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the pauli matrix operators relative to the @xmath10th spin ; @xmath11 are the coupling constants that we assume time independent but possibly space - dependent in the random case ; finally @xmath12 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the homogeneous chain is critical for @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding conformal field theory ( cft ) is described using a central charge @xmath14 .",
    "we study the properties of the von neumann entropy @xmath0 of a block containing the first @xmath15 spins .",
    "the block is described by the reduced density matrix @xmath16 and @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath17 we used the t - dmrg algorithm with a second order trotter expansion of @xmath18 as described in refs .",
    "we checked the precision of the numerics by comparing the results with the case @xmath19 where eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) is mapped onto a free fermion model  @xcite .",
    "we first present the result for the homogeneous case and then that for the disordered one .",

    "they are shown in fig .",

    "this can be explained with a simple argument .",
    "because of the xxz interaction , neighbor spins tend to form spin singlets , so the oscillations in the entropy of block reflect the breaking or not of one of these singlets . such an alternating behaviour has been observed also in ref .  @xcite . though this behavior disappears increasing @xmath7 we fitted numerical data for even @xmath15 because the convergence is faster .      to date the only results obtained for the evolution of block entropy after a quench",
    "have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . by means of cft",
    "it was shown that a quench of the system from a non critical to a critical point leads the block entropy to increase in time until a saturation point is obtained .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , the time at which the entropy saturates is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spin wave velocity : @xmath35 .",
    "this phenomenon has a simple interpretation in terms of quasiparticles excitations emitted from the initial state at @xmath36 and freely propagating with velocity @xmath34 .",
    "this explanation holds even for non critical systems , as it has been confirmed by the exact solution of the ising chain dynamics @xcite .",
    "however , since in lattice models there are particles moving slower than @xmath34 , after @xmath37 the entropy does not saturate abruptly , but is a slowly increasing function of the time .",

    "clearly the presence of boundary condition at @xmath78 , changes this result , since it acts as a wall and particles reaching it can not propagate any longer in a straight line . if we assume that the wall at @xmath78 is reflecting , it works like a mirror for the quasiparticles .",

    "interestingly now the entropy does not grow linearly as in the non - random case .",

    "thus for infinitely large times the entanglement entropy saturates to a value that is reminiscent of the one in the ground state , but the prefactor of the logarithm seems to be different ( if our fit holds for large times it is exactly the half ) .",
    "several considerations are in order at this stage . as compared to the clean case ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , [ fig:3 ] , [ fig:4 ] ) the increase of the entropy as a function of time is much slower .",
    "the logarithmic behaviour does not follow from an extension of the argument for the clean case  @xcite assuming that pair of particles that are emitted diffuse rather than moving ballistically . at this stage",
    "we can not present arguments to derived the logarithmic increase of entropy in disordered chain .",

    "<S> by means of the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm we study the zero - temperature dynamics of the von neumann entropy of a block of spins in a heisenberg chain after a sudden quench in the anisotropy parameter . in the absence of any disorder </S>",
    "<S> the block entropy increases linearly with time and then saturates . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the velocity of propagation of the entanglement as a function of the initial and final anisotropies and compare , wherever possible , our results with those obtained by means of conformal field theory . in the disordered case </S>",
    "<S> we find a slower ( logarithmic ) evolution which may signals the onset of entanglement localization .    </S>",
