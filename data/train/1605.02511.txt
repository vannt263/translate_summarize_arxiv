    "being one of the simplest polyatomic molecules and present in many environments , including the interstellar medium , brown dwarfs and solar system planets , nh@xmath0  is a very important molecule for astronomers .",
    "it also has several applications in industry , such as the reduction of nox emissions in smoke stacks @xcite and the manufacture of hydrogen cyanide by the andrussow process @xcite .",
    "this has motivated over 140 experimental studies on its spectrum , recent work includes high @xcite and low @xcite temperature studies in various spectral regions .",
    "a comprehensive compilation of measured nh@xmath0   rotational and ro - vibrational spectra can be found in a recent marvel study @xcite .",
    "the marvel ( measured active rotation - vibration energy levels ) algorithm @xcite simultaneously analyses all available assigned and labelled experimental lines , thus yielding the associated energy levels .",
    "the recent study for nh@xmath0  analysed 29,450 measured transitions and yielded 4961 accurately - determined energy levels .",
    "the critically reviewed and validated high resolution experiments employed by this study , cover the region 0.7 - 17,000 @xmath1  with a large gap between 7000  15,000 @xmath1 .",
    "in fact there is an overall lack of detailed and accurate information for nh@xmath0  transitions in this region .",
    "the band model parameters of irwin _ et al _ @xcite cover the region 400 to 11000 @xmath1 , but was intended for analysis at low spectral resolution so the measurements were obtained at a spectral resolution of only 0.25 @xmath1  and not assigned .",
    "the hitran database @xcite , a major source of experimental data , contains no information for nh@xmath0  above 7000 @xmath1 .",
    "a number of variational line lists are available for nh@xmath0   @xcite . in this work we use",
    "byte @xcite which is a variationally computed line list for hot nh@xmath0  that covers the range 0 - 12,000 @xmath1 .",
    "byte is expected to be fairly accurate for all temperatures up to 1500 k ( 1226 @xmath2c ) .",
    "it comprises of 1  138  323  251 transitions constructed from 1  373  897 energy levels lying below 18  000 @xmath1 .",
    "it was computed using the nh3 - 2010 potential energy surface @xcite , the trove ro - vibrational computer program @xcite and an _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moment surface @xcite .",
    "however this line list is known to be less accurate for higher wavenumber transitions @xcite , and assigned high resolution laboratory spectra in poorly characterised regions is needed .",
    "the reason for the void between 7000 and 15,000 @xmath1  is the complexity of the nh@xmath0  spectrum making analysis of experimental spectra using the established method of fitting hamiltonians tricky @xcite . in the present work we take on this challenge by employing the same technique used previously @xcite to study high temperature spectra , to study the room temperature , near infrared spectrum of nh@xmath0  in the 7400  8600 @xmath1   region .",
    "this region is of present interest .",
    "for example there are peaks in nh@xmath0  opacity between 1.210 @xmath3 m  and 1.276 @xmath3 m  which are important features in late type t dwarfs @xcite . in wavenumbers",
    "this region is 7836 - 8265 @xmath1  which is covered by an unanalysed 1980 room temperature spectrum in the kitt peak archive .",
    "this spectrum was recently used by campargue _",
    "et al _ @xcite to identify residual nh@xmath0  lines in their ultra - long pathlength water spectra .",
    "this article has the following structure .",
    "section 2 describes the kitt peak spectrum and the construction of the experimental line list .",
    "section 3 gives an overview of the assignment procedure .",
    "section 4 comes in two parts .",
    "the accuracy of byte is assessed in section 4.1 by a direct comparison with the experimental line list .",
    "a summary of all assignments and new experimental energies is presented in section 4.2 .",
    "finally section 5 gives our conclusions and discusses avenues for further work .",
    "the kitt peak data center provides open access to laboratory fourier transform ( ft ) spectra recorded at kitt peak .",
    "the room temperature laboratory absorption spectrum of nh@xmath0   analysed by the present work ( 800407r0.004 ) was recorded by dr .",
    "catherine de bergh using a one metre ft spectrometer .",
    "the spectrometer in question was a permanent instrument on the mcmath solar telescope , the largest solar telescope in the world @xcite , and was used for both solar and laboratory analysis . in 2012",
    "the instrument was transferred to old dominion university @xcite .",
    "the spectrum was recorded at a resolution of 0.01 @xmath1  and generated from an average of 12 scans . some key information provided in the fits header",
    "is presented in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the first and last wavenumber are listed as   5797 @xmath1  and 9682 @xmath1  respectively but our study focusses on the region 7400 - 8600 @xmath1 .",

    "in this paper we present an experimental line list for , and an analysis of , a 35 year old room temperature spectrum of nh@xmath0  in the region 7400 ",
    "8600 @xmath1 .",
    "the centers and intensities of 8468 ammonia lines were retrieved using a multiline fitting of the spectrum . for isolated lines of intermediate strength the accuracy of retrieved line position and intensities",
    "is estimated to be of the order 3@xmath4 @xmath1  and 15 %  respectively . although it should be noted that the uncertainty in the retrieved intensity may significantly exceed 15%  for lines stronger that @xmath5 cm / molecule .",
    "a comparison between the measurements and byte shows in general good agreement but there are shifts in line position of up to 3 @xmath1 throughout the region and experimental line intensities are only reproduced with 20 - 55 % at best .",
    "work towards a new , more accurate , hot nh@xmath0  line list is currently being carried out as part of the exomol project @xcite .",
    "the use of byte and marvel has allowed the assignment of 2474 lines , 1343 by combination differences and a further 1131 by the method of branches . in total 1692 new experimental energies between 7000 - 9000 @xmath1",
    "have been derived .",
    "assignments associated with strong bands with tens of combination difference and branch assignments should all be reliable , as these bands are well characterised and have stable observed minus calculated differences throughout the band .",
    "the remaining assignments should also be safe , as all results from the two assignment procedures have proven very consistent , though these are more tentative .",
    "we note that a room temperature spectrum for nh@xmath0  in the 9000  10,000 @xmath1  region , also measured by dr catherine de bergh in 1980 , is available from the kitt peak archive .",
    "we plan to make this a focus of future work although it is to be anticipated that current line lists will be less reliable at these higher wavenumbers .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from energinet.dk project n. 2013 - 1 - 1027 , by ucl through the impact studentship program and the european research council under advanced investigator project 267219 .",
