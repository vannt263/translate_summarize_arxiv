    "thorough understanding of the interrelated structural and magnetic properties of complex geometrically frustrated systems remain always interesting as absence of long - range magnetic order in such systems opens up the possibilities of a wide range of excited state properties @xcite .",
    "such half - integral spin , especially the spin-1/2 low - dimensional magnetic system with a singlet ground state , attracts much attention due to their fundamental quantum nature @xcite and are also considered to be suitable two - level system for quantum computing.@xcite observation of pseudo spin - gap in high-@xmath2 cuprates @xcite has motivated intensive study of spin - exchange mechanism of new spin - gap systems . increasing experimental activity on complex low - dimensional magnetic systems @xcite motivates a detailed theoretical first - principles investigations of the underlying mechanism of substitution - induced structural distortions and the resulting changes in magnetic exchange properties to understand the evolution of a long - range ordered system into a low - dimensional one .",
    "moreover , for complex geometrically frustrated system , identification of exchange paths relevant to the formation of minimal spin - hamiltonian and thus determination of effective magnetic mechanism can provide the insight about magnetostructural correlations .",

    "@xcite the parent compound , co@xmath0po@xmath1oh is experimentally observed to possess a three - dimensional antiferromagnetic order at around 70 k. substitution of cu gradually in place of co1 , co2 and finally for both co1 and co2 sites leads to the onset of low - dimensional magnetic properties in this system .",

    "previous experimental observations on cu@xmath0po@xmath1oh system @xcite predict a singlet ground state with a spin - gap @xmath4141 k. a simpler analogue of the spin - exchange mechanism were put forward via the square spin - tetramer(sqst ) model.@xcite in the present study , we adopt suitable density functional theory ( dft)-based methodologies to first identify and then calculate the relevant exchange interactions in such systems , which appears to be more complicated than the sqst model.@xcite next , we construct the minimal heisenberg model for the final system and approximately solve it within first order perturbation theory to evaluate the spin - gap between the singlet ground state and the triplet excited state",
    ". such multistep analysis will be helpful to build a generalised spin - model hamiltonian for the low - dimensional tetramer systems and also provides understanding of the correlation between the magnetic and structural properties .",
    "for the last system , effects of size - reduction and cell - volume reduction on the exchange mechanism are also studied .",

    "i to iv , as a combined effect of decrease in o2-a1-o2 and o1-a1-o1 and increase in a1-o2-a1 bond - angles , the difference between the intra and inter tetramer a1-a1 _ z_-direction distance nullifies along the series ( table i ) and thereby the _ z_-direction a1-a1 dimer chain structurally turn into a monomer chain .",
    "this also leads to a jahn - teller like elongation of the distorted octahedra . although the a1-o1-a2 angle does not change much , but as a result of increase in a1-o1-a1 and a2-o3-a2 angle , the intra - tetramer a1-a2 distance reduces and inter - tetramer a2-a2 distance increases along the series .",
    "interestingly , disparity of bond - lengths of a1 and a2 with o1 and o2 and h - ligands leads to a competition in the cationic covalency which also has footprints on the ligand - field splitting and localized band structure as discussed in the next step .",
    "however , system ( iii ) slightly breaks the gradual order in some structural details , viz , a1-o1-a1 and a2-o3-a2 bond angles are more than system iv , which leads to a change in the coordination of ligand o4 around a1 ( dist @xmath10 1.98 ) such that a1 - o4 bonds are formed for system iii .",

    "in conclusion , for the general class of libethenite system , the effect of substitutional impurity induced transformation from a three dimensional antiferromagnet to a low - dimensional quantum spin-1/2 tetramer system is investigated with the combined effects of structural and localized band - structure analysis along this series .",
    "the interplay between the structural distortion introduced by cu - substitution at co - site and its manifestation into the spin - magnetic structure of the series of systems are investigated with the help of appropriate dft techniques .",
