    "the field - matter interaction is commonly described by the dicke hamiltonian  @xcite , which considers @xmath1 two - level atoms with energy separation equal to @xmath2 immersed in an external one - mode electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath3 inside a cavity .",
    "this hamiltonian comes from the standard quantization of the multipolar form of many atoms interacting with classical radiation  @xcite in the long wave approximation .",
    "the dicke model was established exploiting the analogy with the spin .",
    "it is considered a multiatom generalization of the jaynes ",

    "the tavis ",
    "cummings model  @xcite is also a many body extension of the jaynes ",
    "cummings model , which considers the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "a very important feature of the dicke hamiltonian discovered by hepp and lieb  @xcite is the presence of a phase transition from the normal to the superradiant behaviour .",
    "the latter , introduced by dicke to describe coherent radiation , is a collective effect involving all @xmath1 atoms in the sample , where the decay rate is proportional to @xmath4 instead of @xmath1 , the expected result for independent atom emission .",
    "while this transition to the superradiant phase has been much debated in the literature  @xcite , due to the smallness of the field - matter coupling strength , recent experimental results indicate that it can actually be observed  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we use the tensorial product of @xmath5- and @xmath6-coherent states as a trial state to calculate the expectation value of the hamiltonian and construct its energy surface .",
    "this is a function that depends on four variables @xmath7 which define the coherent states , and two essential parameters @xmath8 which are associated to the energy separation of the two - level atoms and the coupling strength between the atoms and the field , respectively . by studying the stability properties of the critical points of this energy surface we obtain the best variational wavefunction and a separatrix which divides the parameter space in two regions : normal and superradiant behaviour , according to @xmath9 or @xmath10 , respectively , with @xmath11 .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian is invariant under transformations of the cyclic group @xmath12 , a symmetry which is not preserved by the trial state .",
    "the symmetry can be restored by acting with the projectors of the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of the cyclic group @xmath12 .",
    "we determine the statistical properties of field and matter observables in the restored variational states @xmath13 in the superradiant region .",
    "the comparison with the same observables evaluated from the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian at finite number of atoms @xmath1 exhibits an excellent agreement between them , which improves as @xmath1 becomes larger  @xcite .",
    "the fidelity between both types of states is also evaluated ; we establish that the fidelity in the superradiant regime is very close to unity , dropping fast in a small neighbourhood of the separatrix .",
    "the great advantage of working with the restored - symmetry states is that they allow us to write down analytic expressions for all the expectation values of field and matter observables , as well as with important mathematical relations .",
    "these analytic expressions are exact in the thermodynamic limit , when the number of particles goes to infinity .    the dicke hamiltonian has been studied thoroughly by emary and brandes  @xcite with a variational procedure in terms of two @xmath6-coherent states .",
    "one of them is related to the radiation field degrees of freedom and the other arises from a holstein - primakoff ( h - p ) realization of the @xmath5 generators  @xcite .",
    "they obtain the appropriate relation between the parameters of the dicke hamiltonian to describe the phase transition , as well as a description for the normal phase in the thermodynamic limit . however , they consider in the superradiant region , an approximated dicke hamiltonian coming from a series expansion of the h - p realization truncated to second order in terms of the ratio between the number of excited atoms over the total number of atoms , assuming that is a very small quantity . under this assumption nagy et al .",
    "@xcite found singularities at @xmath14 in the expectation values of the number of photons and the number of excited atoms , and related them with the divergences in their corresponding fluctuations  @xcite .    in this contribution we extend and provide details of the calculations presented in  @xcite",
    "the expectation values of the mentioned observables are calculated by means of the symmetry adapted variational states and find that there is in fact a divergence of the expectation values , but that this remains throughout the superradiant region , contrary to the published results : there is no singularity .",
    "the expectation value of the number of photons @xmath15 and the squared fluctuation of the first quadrature of the electromagnetic field @xmath16 are proportional to the number of atoms at the phase transition and in the superradiant regime , while the squared fluctuation @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath18 in the same region .",
    "comparison with the exact numerical solution supports our results .",
    "this could have consequences in studies of entanglement and chaos in the superradiant region .",
    "the dicke hamiltonian involves the collective interaction of @xmath1 two - level atoms with energy separation @xmath2 with a one - mode radiation field of frequency @xmath3 in the long wavelenght limit .",

    "later we will find it convenient to divide the dicke hamiltonian by the total number of particles , having in this way an intensive hamiltonian operator . in order to study the thermodynamic limit one would take @xmath29 .    to find the symmetries of the hamiltonian",

    "<S> we show that semi - classical states adapted to the symmetry of the hamiltonian are an excellent approximation to the exact quantum solution of the ground and first excited states of the dicke model . </S>",
    "<S> their overlap to the exact quantum states is very close to @xmath0 except in a close vicinity of the quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they have analytic forms in terms of the model parameters and allow us to calculate analytically the expectation values of field and matter observables . some of these differ considerably from results obtained via the standard coherent states , and by means of holstein - primakoff series expansion of the dicke hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with exact solutions obtained numerically support our results . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that the expectation values of the number of photons and of the number of excited atoms have no singularities at the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on why other authors have previously found otherwise . </S>"
