    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) gs 1826238 was discovered with _ ginga _ in 1988 ( makino et al . 1988 ) . due to its temporal and spectral similarities",
    "to cyg x1 and gx 3394 , the source was originally tentatively classified as a black hole candidate ( bhc ) ( tanaka 1989 ) .",
    "later optical studies lead to the identification of a @xmath6 mag ( and therefore low - mass ) optical counterpart ( barret et al .",
    "the companion was subsequently found to have a 2.1 hr modulation ( and implied orbital period ) and a refined position of @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( j2000 ) ( homer et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the spectral and temporal characteristics that tanaka ( 1989 ) initially used to associate gs 1826238 with a black hole system were later found to be present in other x - ray bursters ( e.g. , 4u 1608522 , yoshida et al . 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , the photon index of its energy spectrum was measured to have a relatively low cut - off energy ( @xmath1 58 kev ) for a bhc , and was perhaps more indicative of the typically cooler neutron star ( ns ) hard x - ray spectra ( strickman et al . 1996 ) .",
    "x - ray bursts from this source were first conclusively observed with _",
    "bepposax _ by ubertini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , firmly establishing the source as a ns and strongly suggesting it to be weakly magnetized ( @xmath9 g ) .",
    "the periodicity of the type i bursts from gs 1826238 has been remarkably stable over the span of years ( ubertini et al .",
    "although quasi - periodic bursting is not unique among lmxbs , such consistency over long durations is indeed unusual .",
    "the regular intervals between bursts suggest that the accretion rate is stable , that the accreted matter is completely consumed during the bursts , and that the fraction of the stellar surface covered prior to each burst is approximately constant .",
    "investigations of burst recurrence rates and energetics have lead to convincing arguments that type i bursts stem from unstable thermonuclear burning of accreted hydrogen and helium ( e.g. , strohmayer & bildsten 2003 ) . as freshly accreted material falls onto the ns surface",
    ", it is hydrostatically compressed by new material at a rate per unit area @xmath10 10@xmath11 g @xmath12 s@xmath13 , assuming isotropic accretion and a ns radius of 10 km .",
    "the thermal energy deposited by the infalling matter causes temperatures in most of the thin ns `` atmosphere '' to exceed @xmath14 k , so that during the accumulation phase hydrogen burns via the hot cno cycle at a rate that is limited only by the mass fraction @xmath15 and not the temperature ( bildsten 2000 ) . within hours to days ,",
    "the extreme gravity on the ns surface ( @xmath1 10@xmath16 cm s@xmath17 ) compresses the accumulated matter to densities high enough to trigger unstable thermonuclear ignition .",
    "gs 1826238 , in particular , has near limit - cycle behavior with stable hydrogen burning during the accumulation phase followed by mixed hydrogen and helium burning triggered by thermally unstable helium ignition ( bildsten 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath4-parameter  the ratio of the integrated persistent fluence between bursts to the burst fluence  and the long burst duration ( @xmath1 150 s ) , imply that after thermonuclear ignition the hydrogen burns via the rapid - proton ( @xmath18 ) process where energy is released through successive proton captures and @xmath19 decays ( wallace & woosley 1981 ) . the measured @xmath4-value for gs 1826238 of @xmath1 42 ( galloway et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter g04 ) is remarkably consistent with theoretical predictions : the gravitational energy released during accretion onto a 1.4 m@xmath20 ns is about 200 mev per nucleon , while the energy released through thermonuclear fusion is about 5 mev per nucleon for a solar mix going to iron group elements , giving an expected value of 40 .",
    "moreover , the variation in @xmath4 with the global accretion rate @xmath21 implies solar metallicity in the accreted layer ( g04 ) , although recent work using an adaptive nuclear reaction network shows that the critical mass required for a burst is independent of the composition of the accreted material ( woosley et al .",
    "2004 ) , and so attempts to infer the metallicity of the fuel from burst properties is complicated .    during accretion the gravitational potential energy released per nucleon is deposited partly in the disk , and partly in the boundary layer or on the ns surface . in low accretion rate ( atoll )",
    "lmxbs , the dominant persistent emission spectral component is clearly inverse comptonization , where soft `` seed '' photons emitted from a cold layer in the accretion disk gain energy in successive scatterings with hot electrons in the disk or surrounding accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( church 2001 ) .",
    "stable hydrogen burning between bursts and the thermal energy released on impact are observable as blackbody emission , assuming there is an optical path through which the radiation can escape .",
    "the addition of a blackbody component in spectral models is not always necessary ( as we find in   [ spec ] ) , which suggests this form of radiation is ( up)scattered or absorbed by the obscuring disk or adc .",
    "another possibility is that the blackbody component is simply too weak to be observed relative to the comptonized emission .",
    "mitsuda et al .",
    "( 1989 ) proposed that most lmxb spectra can be described by a multi - temperature disk blackbody from the inner accretion disk plus blackbody emission from the ns which is comptonized in the local region of the star .",
    "more recently , the dipping class of lmxbs has constrained the types of emission models that are most likely .",
    "the constraints are provided by the fact that the models must fit the persistent emission at various levels of decreased flux resulting from partial occultation and absorption of the ns , accretion disk , and corona by the bulge in the outer disk where accretion flow from the companion star impacts .",
    "the evolution of these spectra at various levels of flux are well - described by a model consisting of point - like blackbody emission plus comptonized emission from an extended accretion disk corona ( e.g. , church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; bauciska - church et al . 2001 ; smale et al .",
    "2001 ) . during dipping ,",
    "the blackbody component is observed to disappear rapidly , indicating that the emission comes from a point and not from an extended region . as expected ,",
    "the comptonized component is observed to gradually decrease . by measuring the ingress times of the dip , church ( 2001 ) was able to estimate the size of the comptonizing region for several sources and found the radius of the region to be typically @xmath1 50,000 km .",
    "this measurement is consistent with the value obtained much earlier by canizares ( 1976 ) for 3u 182030 .",
    "the large extent of the emission region is evidence for a comptonized component that is emitted from an adc and not the disk itself .",
    "moreover , smale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) observed complete covering of this region in many sources , suggesting that the corona must be geometrically thin , as it would be unlikely that a corona with spherical geometry would be completely occulted . on the contrary ,",
    "studies of emission and absorption features in dipping sources by boirin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that the spectra are also consistent with a less strongly ionized absorber along the line of sight rather than a simple increase in absorption .",
    "progressive covering of the comptonized component in their models is not required .",
    "the persistent emission spectrum of gs 1826238 has been discussed by previous authors ( e.g. , barret et al . 1995 , ubertini et al . 1999 , del sordo et al .",

    "broadband _ bepposax _",
    "spectra in the 0.1200 kev range found the spectrum to be consistent with the comptonization of a 0.6 kev wien spectrum by a plasma with @xmath22 kev , plus a 3.8 kev blackbody ( in t zand et al .",

    "( 1999a ) studied burst spectra and found significant flux up to 60 kev , indicating that the burst emission may be comptonized in a similar manner as the persistent emission .",

    "( 1999 ) studied the spectrum for two bursts , though with only two separate integration bins of 13 s at burst peak and 43 s through the decay .",

    "the source was focused onto one of the back - illuminated acis chips ( s3 ) . to minimize the adverse effects due to pile - up , and to gain better time resolution on the rise of the bursts , we used half - frame readout on the inner 4 acis chips with 1.74 s frame - time .",
    "we use the `` level 2 '' event lists from the standard data processing , and apply a standard correction to destreak the acis - s4 chip caused by a flaw in the chip readout . to obtain high resolution spectra , we had the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ; canizares et al .",

    "all of the _ chandra _  analysis made extensive use of the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 3.01 software with calibration version ( caldb ) 2.26 .",
    "we used the ciao routine _ tgextract _ for the extraction of grating spectra , _ mkgrmf _ to produce response matrices , and _ fullgarf _ to create the auxiliary response matrices .",
    "we added the positive and negative diffraction orders and their corresponding auxiliary response files using the script _",
    "systematic errors of 10% were derived from calibration observations of the crab pulsar and mrk 421 , and were added to both the persistent and burst emission fits .",
    "we binned the persistent and burst emission data in the largest possible bins to obtain maximum statistical quality , while maintaining sufficient resolution to observe prominent absorption or emission lines . for the persistent emission analysis we bin the data in 1000 count pha bins , and in the burst analysis we use 500 count bins .",
    "this generally led to bins with width @xmath1 50100 ev .",
    "we excluded the meg 1@xmath30 order data from 0.80.9 kev because these data fall on a gap between the acis chips .",

    "in addition , the data from 2.02.5 kev are possibly affected by pile - up , which we estimate to be about 10% at the maximum .",
    "spectral distortion due to pile - up is accounted for by the hetg systematics .",
    "the extraction of pca and hexte energy spectra used scripts developed at the university of california , san diego and the university of tbingen that incorporate the standard software for _ rxte _  data reduction ( ftools ) .",
    "the large effective area of the pca provides excellent statistics without rebinning the data , however the first three channels and the data above 23 kev were not used .",
    "we placed systematic uncertainties of 0.5% on the pca data to account for the likely uncertainty in the response ( kreykenbohm et al .",
    "the hexte data below 17 kev and above 200 kev are not included in the analysis .",
    "we used successively larger energy bins at higher energies to account for the decreasing flux density . during the burst intervals hexte",
    "did not yield a significant number of counts above 40 kev .",
    "we included no systematics to the hexte data .",
    "for analysis during the burst time intervals we added the data for the 3 bursts ( corresponding to the 2@xmath32 , 3@xmath33 , and 6@xmath34 _ chandra _  bursts ) viewed when pcus 0 and 2 were taking data ; pcus 0 and 2 had the greatest coverage in this observation .",
    "the pha bins were added together using the ftools task _",
    "as discussed in   1 , gs 1826238 has exhibited a nearly periodic bursting behavior since type i bursts from this source were first discovered in 1997 .",
    "the remarkable consistency of the burst cycle can easily be seen in fig .",
    "chandra _",
    "light curve uses all hetg data from 0.38 kev , but does not include any counts from the zeroth order source region as these data are affected by severe pile - up . not only is the burst recurrence time approximately constant , but the light curve of any particular burst is virtually indistinguishable from any other ( see fig . 1 ( _ c _ ) ) . although the time between sequential bursts has been rather constant , the average burst recurrence time has been observed to be steadily decreasing over long time scales ( cocchi et al .",
    "2000 , g04 ) . using a total of 44 _ rxte _  observations from 1997 november to 2002",
    "july , g04 measured the burst interval to be 5.74 @xmath0 0.13 hr initially , 4.10 @xmath0 0.08 hr in 2000 , and 3.56 @xmath0 0.03 hr in 2002 .",
    "we measured the average burst recurrence time of the five complete _ chandra _  intervals to be 3.54 @xmath0 0.03 hr ( 12750 @xmath0 102 s ; also in 2002 ) .",
    "the individual intervals were measured from burst peak to peak and are listed in table 2 .",
    "the 2002 recurrence time measurement by g04 was measured using the same pca data that we use in this paper , while our measurement is based on the _ chandra _  data .",
    "[ fig1 ]     cc[!b ] 1@xmath352 & 12861 + 2@xmath353 & 12884 + 3@xmath354 & 12510 + 4@xmath355 & 12994 + 5@xmath356 & 12502 +    the 40% decrease in the burst recurrence time from 1997 to 2002 has been coupled with a 66% increase in the mean persistent flux ( g04 ) .",
    "such behavior is expected since the increase in persistent luminosity is assumed to be due to an increase in the global accretion rate , and therefore less time is required to reach the critical amount of fuel . while the observations of g04 are consistent with this trend , bildsten ( 2000 ) found exactly the opposite behavior in many low accretion rate lmxbs .",
    "for example , bursts from 4u 170544 became less frequent as @xmath21 increased .",
    "to explain the conundrum , bildsten ( 2000 ) suggested that a greater fraction of the stellar surface of 4u 170544 may be covered prior to ignition , so that the accretion rate per unit area actually decreased",
    ". this may also be the case for gs 1826238 : if the relation between the rise in the persistent flux and the decrease in the burst recurrence time were linear , we would expect an even greater decrease in burst recurrence time than has been observed by g04 .",
    "another possible explanation for the longer - than - expected recurrence time regards the fact that at smaller recurrence times , less helium will be made prior to ignition , and so the column depth required to produce the instability will increase ( cumming & bildsten 2000 ) .    the location of the burning during bursts is not assumed to be spherically symmetrical .",
    "it is likely that ignition begins near the stellar equator since matter is preferentially deposited there during accretion ( spitkovsky et al .",
    "the anisotropic burning caused by the hot spot at the point of ignition may be revealed through the observation of burst oscillations , the frequencies of which correspond to the ns rotation frequencies ( e.g. , muno 2004 ) .",
    "we searched for burst oscillations by computing and averaging the power spectra for the 3 bursts observed with 125 @xmath36s resolution event mode pca data using a sampling rate of 2048 hz ( nyquist frequency : 1024 hz ) . to improve statistics , we averaged power spectra for sequential 0.25 , 0.5 and 1 s sections of the light curve ( 4 , 2 , and 1 hz resolution ) , with total segment lengths varying from 3 to 30 s. we searched in the @xmath1 10 s rise , around the burst peak , and at different times during the burst decay until 65 s from the burst peak .",
    "pca deadtime effects cause a @xmath1 1% decrease in the mean value of the poisson noise to 1.98 ( from 2.0 ) in the leahy normalization ( see leahy et al . 1983 ) .",
    "we initially included the entire 260 kev energy band and made no significant detections at any point during the burst .",
    "we then tried varying the energy ranges included in the pca light curves . with the 1030 kev data",
    ", we made a detection 1530 s from the burst peak around 612 hz ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the significance of the signal was maximized with 0.25 s segment light curves ; therefore , 180 separate power spectra were averaged .",
    "the signal could be observed in each burst separately though with less significance .",
    "we then tried expanding the energy range that was included in the pca light curves ; the signal weakened with the inclusion of either higher and lower energy photons .",
    "the 101024 hz leahy - normalized power spectrum is presented in figure 2 , along with a power spectrum centered on the signal and a histogram of the difference in power from the mean .",
    "the power at 612 hz deviates from the poisson level by 4.7@xmath37 , which with 256 bins means that there is a 0.033% chance that the detection is spurious . using a power spectrum with 1 hz resolution",
    ", we fit a lorentzian function to the peak , giving a frequency @xmath38 611.2 hz with @xmath39 hz .",
    "the average rms amplitude of the peak is 4.8% , which is consistent with the 5% rms amplitude of typical burst oscillations observed in lmxbs ( muno 2004 ) .",
    "along with burst energetics and timing , we can learn much from gs 1826238 through its energy spectra .",
    "we began our investigation by creating spectra for 1 ks intervals following the onset of a burst in order to see if there were significant changes in the best - fit parameters between bursts . since the average burst recurrence time for the five complete burst intervals in the 68 ks _",
    "chandra _",
    "observation was measured to be 12750 @xmath0 102 s , we were able to create 1 ks intervals up to 1112 ks after the burst . to improve statistics we stacked the datasets from all five _ chandra _  burst intervals .",
    "we also constructed nearly two complete burst intervals using the simultaneously acquired _ rxte _  data .",
    "although these data have time gaps , we determined the time since the previous burst for any individual _",
    "_  dataset by comparing it to the _ chandra _  burst times . with the benefit of the simultaneous observations we obtained statistically significant measurements from 0.5200 kev for each 1 ks interval ( except 910 ks ) . to each dataset",
    ", we fit a model composed of comptonized emission plus a broken power law .",
    "this preliminary model was only used to examine whether or not there were significant changes to the spectrum with time , and ultimately , a different model was determined to be more physically plausible ( see below ) .",
    "nevertheless , this exercise showed us that the best - fit parameters remain approximately constant after 1 ks , although with slightly elevated soft x - ray flux through 3 ks from the peak of the burst . in the following fits ,",
    "we therefore define the persistent spectrum to be for @xmath40 ks . in the integrated persistent emission analysis",
    "below , we found that the inclusion of data from 13 ks only minimally distorted most spectral parameters , however the inferred @xmath41 was underestimated by @xmath1 50% due to the excess of soft photons .",
    "we are fortunate to have _ chandra _  data along with _ rxte _  since observations of bursters with low - earth orbit telescopes may miss some bursts if they occur during a gap in coverage when the source is occulted by the earth or the telescope is passing through the south atlantic anomaly .",
    "( _ b _ ) provides an illustration of the potential ambiguity involved with the selection of persistent emission datasets . for example , it is clear that any persistent emission analysis would be slightly distorted if the first 3 ks of the second pca observation ( corresponding to the decay of the first burst observed with _ chandra _ ) were included .      by summing all pha datasets that fall within the 312 ks interval",
    ", we further constrain the statistics and explore standard models for lmxbs in addition to other models .",
    "lmxbs are typically modeled with a blackbody or disk blackbody to represent the ns surface or the inner accretion disk , plus comptonized emission which can be modeled in xspec with comptt or a cut - off power law ( cutoffpl ) .",
    "although these models have similar profiles , they are not necessarily interchangeable .",
    "while comptonized emission can be empirically described with a cut - off power law , the model of titarchuk ( 1994 ) is derived from analytical equations that are founded on the real analytical theory of comptonization of soft photons , and the output parameters are physically explicit which allow direct interpretation . on the contrary , the index of a cut - off power law can not be interpreted in physical terms , while in comptt it is related to the combination of the optical depth and plasma temperature .",
    "albeit , the cut - off energy of cutoffpl is related to the plasma temperature as @xmath42 . for these reasons we chose the titarchuk ( 1994 ) model to represent comptonized emission . with this description ,",
    "the spectrum is governed entirely by the plasma temperature and the @xmath19 parameter , which characterizes the distribution law of the number of scatterings ( i.e. , @xmath43 is the probability that a seed photon undergoes @xmath44 scatterings before escaping the plasma ) .",
    "the optical depth of the plasma is calculated from the @xmath19 parameter and depends on the input geometry : disk or spherical . generally , for a given @xmath19 parameter",
    ", a larger optical depth is inferred from a spherical geometry than a disk geometry .",
    "this is because the final spectral shape is determined by photons which undergo many more scatterings than the mean , and the longest dimension of a spherical plasma cloud is clearly shorter than that of a disk ( titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "we initially tried to fit the data by employing a single comptt component , but the resulting fit was unacceptable due to excesses above 70 kev and below 1.5 kev .",
    "the addition of a blackbody component reduced the soft excess , and allowed the plasma temperature and thus the up - scattering efficiency to increase ( since @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the comptonization parameter ) to try to match the hard excess .",
    "although the fit was better ( @xmath47 ) , it was still unacceptable .",
    "this is contrary to the results of in t zand et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , who successfully used this model , although the 3.8 kev best - fit blackbody temperature is probably non - physical .",
    "the best - fit blackbody temperature that we obtained with this model was @xmath1 0.5 kev , which seems more reasonable .",
    "after trying various models in conjunction with comptt , we found the fit to be most improved by an additional comptt component , resulting in a model that can be interpreted as the comptonization of soft photons from two distinct emission regions .",
    "one of the emission regions contributes 62% of the total luminosity , so we label it as the  primary \" emission region , and the other as the  secondary \" emission region .",
    "the primary emission region is characterized by @xmath48 kev , and @xmath49 19.722.1 kev ( depending on the chosen geometry ) , while the secondary emission region has @xmath50 kev and @xmath49 6.16.4 kev .",
    "the primary emission accounts for about 70% of the flux from 0.53 kev , and 80% of the flux from 20200 kev , while each comptonization component contributes nearly an equal amount of flux for 320 kev . based on the inferred @xmath19 parameter , which is not a direct input in xspec",
    ", the primary emission region has @xmath51 if the region is disk - shaped , or @xmath52 if it is spherical .",
    "the secondary emission region is characterized by @xmath53 and @xmath54 for disk and spherical geometries , respectively .",
    "the physical interpretation of each comptonizing region must be inferred from the best - fit parameters and the corresponding flux contributions . for one , we expect the comptonizing region closer to the stellar surface to have hotter seed photons , which suggests that the secondary component is emitted nearer to the ns .",
    "the secondary component may therefore result from boundary layer or surface emission .",
    "conversely , the primary emission possibly stems from the accretion disk or adc , and a disk geometry implies @xmath51 . from the relative flux contributions , we see that this interpretation requires about 3/5 of the total flux to be emitted from the cooler disk region .",
    "accretion theory predicts that half of the total gravitational binding energy per unit mass is released in the disk , and the other half in the boundary layer or on the stellar surface ( frank et al .",
    "this is not inconsistent since the accretion disk and the boundary layer are not physically distinct ; rather , there may be a smooth transition from one to the other .",
    "secondly , the optical depth of the secondary emission ( independent of the true geometry ) is large enough to naturally explain the lack of a visible blackbody component in the gs 1826238 spectrum . according to inogamov & sunyaev ( 1999 )",
    ", the spreading of accretion flow from the equator to the poles leads to two bright rings of enhanced emission that are symmetric about the equator .",
    "the latitude of these rings increases with accretion rate , and in the accretion regime of gs 1826238 , i.e. @xmath1 10@xmath55 g s@xmath13 ( inferred from the total flux ) , these rings lie @xmath1 0.51.5 km from the equator . therefore , assuming the blackbody emission comes from these rings , the secondary comptonized emission region only has to be large enough to cover the inner @xmath01.5 km above and below the equator . following in t zand et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , an approximate effective radius for the spherical emission area of the wien seed photons is given by @xmath56 km , where @xmath57 is in kpc , the flux is measured in erg s@xmath13 @xmath12 , and the seed photons are measured in kev .",
    "this approach yielded a soft photon emitting region with radius @xmath58 km , which is only consistent with the seed photons being generated at the boundary layer if the region is confined to a half - thickness of @xmath1 2.5 km , depending on the inclination of the system , and assuming that any emission from  below \" the accretion disk is not observable .",
    "finally , since the flux of photons passing through the boundary layer relative to the disk is larger per unit area , we expect compton cooling to maintain a lower plasma temperature for the secondary comptonized emission region .",
    "this is indeed what is observed ( see table 3 ) .",
    "in addition to a dual comptonization model , we also modeled the spectrum with a single comptt plus a broken power law in order to give an estimate of its shape for possible non - thermal interpretation .",
    "if the secondary emission is indeed non - thermal , perhaps it stems from an adc generated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , analogous to what is observed in the solar corona ( crosby et al .",
    "alternatively , the emission may be synchrotron radiation from a relativistic jet escaping the system .",
    "such jets have been found to be rather common among lmxbs and link these systems to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ( e.g. , fender 2002 ) .",
    "clearly , these possibilities are highly speculative .      after obtaining a fit with the two component models , the residuals revealed a line feature around 6.5 kev , which prompted the addition of a gaussian to the models .",
    "the best - fit value for the line was measured to be approximately @xmath59 kev , with a flux which corresponds to an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath1 37.2 ev . we interpret this feature as a neutral fe k@xmath4 line .",

    "we note that since @xmath42 , the @xmath1 42 kev cut - off energy is consistent with the @xmath1 20 kev plasma temperature of the primary comptonized component of model 1 .",

    "the stellar radius is when the accretion disk is perpendicular to the line of sight ( @xmath168 ) . in all other cases",

    "the area of the covered region increases nonlinearly with increasing binary inclination , moving from 0% of the projected area when @xmath169 to 50% when @xmath170 .",
    "furthermore , since accretion disks are not infinitely thin there will also be some portion of the surface covered by the disk .",

    "( 1995 ) derived an approximate lower limit to the distance to gs 1826238 of 4 kpc . assuming the range of possible binary inclinations used above is correct , it is apparent that a source distance near 5 kpc gives a ns radius within the commonly assumed range of @xmath1 1012 km ( see the right axis of fig .",
    "6 ) . on the contrary",
    ", a distance of 6 kpc does not give a ns radius within the common range .",
    "even with an infinitely thin accretion disk and an inclination at the lower bound ( @xmath177 ) of mescheryakov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the smallest possible stellar radius at this distance within the error limits is @xmath1 11 km .    from the results of the table 4 ,",
    "it is clear that the burst photons immediately cool the comptonizing plasma to @xmath1 3.4 kev . over the next 150 s ,",
    "the plasma temperature recovers the persistent emission value of @xmath1 6.8 kev .",
    "this type of plasma cooling during a burst may be an example of compton cooling .",
    "the same inverse compton scattering process that transfers energy to the persistent emission photons also transfers energy to the photons emitted during a burst .",
    "the difference is that during the burst the flux of photons increases by more than an order of magnitude ( for the 010 s interval ) , so that the balance between heating and radiative cooling is disturbed .",
    "it is also evident that the optical depth of the plasma is weakly constrained in the burst spectral analysis .",
    "although the best - fit values for the first few intervals seem to indicate a larger optical depth , the range of uncertainty still includes the persistent emission value .",
    "since blackbody emission is observable during the bursts but not during the quiescent phase , we can speculate as to the geometries of the corresponding emission regions .",
    "to begin , gs 1826238 has a weak magnetic field so infalling matter probably impacts the ns along the equator rather than at the poles .",
    "the release of gravitational binding energy through thermalization of the accreted material may result in a strip of blackbody emission along the equator ( church & bauciska - church 2001 ) , or the accumulation and spreading of accretion flow from the equator toward the poles may cause two bright emission rings that are symmetric about the equator ( inogamov & sunyaev 1999 ) . the inability to see",
    "blackbody emission in the interval between bursts suggests that the equatorial strip or enhanced bright rings must be covered by an optically thick layer .",
    "this is explained naturally by the persistent emission dual comptonization model .",
    "at the onset of a burst , ignition likely starts near the equator and then rapidly spreads to cover the entire stellar surface in a couple seconds or less ( spitkovsky et al .",
    "once the entire accumulated layer is burning , the subsequent blackbody emission indicates that there is an optical path for the radiation outside of the equatorial strip .",
    "it could be argued that the accretion flow is disrupted during a burst , or that a spherical corona surrounding the ns is temporarily blown away , and that this provides a path for the blackbody emission .",
    "however , the flux provided by the inner comptonizing region also increases substantially during a burst , so the boundary layer plasma must still be present to up - scatter the seed photons .",
    "moreover , our measurement of the wien emission radius ( @xmath1 4 km ) is too small for the corona to completely surround the star .",
    "instead , we assume that this emission region is likely confined to the equatorial region .",
    "this explanation supports theories where the comptonizing plasma or adc is geometrically thin .",
    "our investigation of the lmxb gs 1826238 using simultaneous _ rxte _  and _ chandra _  observations has led us to the following conclusions . from the observation of five uninterrupted burst intervals with _",
    "chandra _  in july 2002 , we measured a burst recurrence time of 3.54 @xmath0 0.03 hr , which is consistent with g04 s measurement .",
    "g04 s measured decrease in the burst recurrence time between 1997 and 2002 has been coupled with an even larger percentage increase in the mean persistent flux , possibly indicating that a greater fraction ( as compared to 1997 ) of the stellar surface may be covered prior to ignition .",
    "we detected 611.2 hz burst oscillations with a 0.033% chance that the signal resulted from random fluctuations .",
    "the average rms amplitude of the peak is 4.8% .",
    "the _ rxte / chandra _ 0.5200 kev integrated persistent emission spectrum is best fit with a dual comptonization model , whereby two distinct comptonizing regions exist and are characterized by a different set of parameters .",
    "the extended energy range of _ rxte _  is essential to constraining the photon index or comptonization parameter , and eliminates the need for a blackbody component .",
    "this result is contrary to most spectral models of lmxbs that include a visible blackbody component .",
    "the spectrum also requires a neutral fe k@xmath4 emission line at 6.45 kev with ew @xmath1 37.2 ev .",
    "in addition , we find strong evidence of interstellar fe l absorption features at the about 17.15   and 17.5  , with significance 3.8@xmath37 and 2.9@xmath37 , respectively .    during a burst ,",
    "blackbody emission accounts for the majority of the flux though it quickly disappears after @xmath1 150 s. throughout this period , the data are consistent with a blackbody radius between 10.3 km and 11.7 km for a distance of 6 kpc if one assumes the blackbody flux comes from the full @xmath178 of the neutron star surface . by accounting for the fraction of the surface that is obscured by the accretion disk",
    ", however , the source distance must be nearer to 5 kpc to be consistent with a neutron star radius of 1012 km .",
    "we also see compton cooling during the bursts , as the plasma temperature immediately decreases to @xmath1 3 kev and then slowly returns to the persistent emission value of @xmath1 6.8 kev after about 150 s. since blackbody emission is not observed in the persistent spectrum yet dominates the burst spectrum , we conclude that the emission from those regions of the stellar surface along the equator are covered in the persistent phase . during the burst",

    "<S> the integrated persistent emission spectrum can be described as the dual comptonization of @xmath1 0.3 kev soft photons by a plasma with @xmath2 kev and @xmath3 ( interpreted as emission from the accretion disk corona ) , plus the comptonization of hotter @xmath1 0.8 kev seed photons by a @xmath1 6.8 kev plasma ( interpreted as emission from or near the boundary layer ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discovered evidence for a neutral fe k@xmath4 emission line , and we found interstellar fe l ii and fe l iii absorption features . </S>",
    "<S> the burst spectrum can be fit by fixing the disk comptonization parameters to the persistent emission best - fit values , and adding a blackbody . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the boundary layer seed photons was tied to the blackbody temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the blackbody / seed photon temperature at the peak of the burst is @xmath1 1.8 kev and returns to @xmath1 0.8 kev over 200 s. the blackbody radius is consistent with @xmath5 10.311.7 km assuming a distance of 6 kpc , though this value can not be interpreted as the physical size of the neutron star due to partial covering of the stellar surface by the accretion disk . by accounting for the fraction of the surface that is obscured by the disk as a function of binary inclination </S>",
    "<S> , we determined the source distance must actually be near 5 kpc in order for the stellar radius to lie within the commonly assumed range of 1012 km . </S>",
    "<S> the order of magnitude increase in flux at burst peak is seen to cause compton cooling of the electron plasma surrounding the disk , as the plasma temperature decreases to @xmath1 3 kev at burst onset , and then slowly returns to the persistent emission value after about 150 s. </S>"
