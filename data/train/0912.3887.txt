    "prior to 2008 , the high energy electron spectrum was measured by balloon - born experiments @xcite and by a single space mission ams-01 @xcite .",
    "those data are compatible with a featureless power law spectrum within their errors .",
    "this is in agreement with theoretical predictions ( for a recent review see @xcite ) assuming : i ) that the source term of cr electrons is treated as a time - independent and smooth function of the position in the galaxy , and the energy dependence is assumed to be a power law ; ii ) that the propagation is described by a diffusion - loss equation whose effect is to steepen the spectral slope respect to the injection .",
    "possible deviations from a simple power law spectrum may , however , be expected above several hundred gev as a consequence of synchrotron radiation and inverse compton ( ic ) energy losses which , at those high energies , limit the electron propagation length to a distance comparable to the mean distance between astrophysical sources @xcite or because the possible presence of exotic sources .",
    "almost a year ago , the atic balloon experiment @xcite found a prominent spectral feature at around 600 gev in the total electron spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite atmospheric cherenkov telescope reported a significant steepening of the electron plus diffuse photon spectrum above 600 gev .",
    "another independent indication of the presence of a possible deviation from the standard picture came from the recent measurements of the positron to electron fraction , e@xmath1 /(e@xmath2",
    "+ e@xmath1 ) , between 1.5 and 100 gev by the pamela satellite experiment @xcite .",
    "pamela found that the positron fraction changes slope at around 10 gev and begins to increase steadily up to 100 gev .",
    "this behavior is very different from that predicted for secondary positrons produced in the collision of cr nuclides with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the experimental information available on the cre spectrum has been drastically expanded as the fermi collaboration has reported a high precision measurement of the electron spectrum from 20 gev to 1 tev performed with its large area telescope ( lat ) @xcite based on the first 6 months of data taking .",
    "preliminary updated fermi - lat measurements , based on the first 12 month data , basically confirm the high energy spectrum measured by fermi above 20 gev and extend it down to almost 7 gev .",
    "in that low energy range the fermi - lat data are compatible with those of ams-01 .",
    "the electron + positron spectrum measured by fermi - lat is compatible with a simple power law of slope @xmath3 and presents some hints of a hardening at around 70 gev and steepening above @xmath4 gev .",
    "although the significance of those features is low within current systematics , they suggest the presence of more components in the electron high energy spectrum .",
    "it is also worth noticing here that the hard electron spectrum observed by this experiment exacerbates the discrepancy between the predictions of standard cr theoretical models and the positron faction excess measured , most conclusively , by pamela @xcite .",
    "this makes the exploration of some non - standard interpretations more compelling .",
    "in this section we discuss a simple possible interpretation of fermi - lat cre data in terms of a conventional   galactic cre scenario assuming that electrons sources are continuously distributed in the galactic disk and that positrons are only produced by the collision of primary cr nuclides with the interstellar gas . to this purpose",
    "we use the galprop numerical cr propagation code @xcite .",
    "we start considering a conventional model assuming a single power - law dependence of the diffusion coefficient on rigidity with index @xmath5 ( kolmogorov like ) and electron ( @xmath6 only ) injection spectral index @xmath7 below / above 4 gev . in @xcite",
    "this model was shown to provide a good description of published fermi - lat data above 20 gev ( few other combinations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 were also shown to fit the data ) .",
    "that model , however , faces a series of problems when compared with other experimental data and , most seriously , with the preliminary low energy fermi - lat , namely : i ) below 20 gev that model predicts an excess of electrons + positrons respect to fermi - lat and ams-01@xcite data when a reasonable solar modulation is considered ( see red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : elepos_242reac ] ) ; ii ) the model overshoot h.e.s.s . data above 1 tev ; iii ) the positron fraction @xmath10 they predict is not consistent with that measered by pamela @xcite ( see the insert in fig . [",
    "fig : elepos_242reac ] ) .    while ( ii ) may be interpreted as a consequence of the stochastic nature of astrophysical sources ( see sec .",
    "2.2 in @xcite and ref.s therein ) or a high energy cut - off in the source spectrum , the other caveats are more serious and call for some revisions of the model .    disregarding high energy ( @xmath11 ) pamela data in this section",
    ", we have only to bother about the discrepancy of the conventional model with low energy data .",
    "it should be noted that below 10 gev solar modulation is expected to affect significantly the spectra of electrons and positrons reaching the earth . in the most simple scenario modulation",
    "is treated as a charge independent cooling effect which can be quantified in terms of a parameter @xmath12 having the dimensions of rigidity ( force field approximation ) .",
    "such parameter is time dependent and it is generally tuned to reproduce cr proton data . in periods of low solar activity ( as those in which fermi , pamela and ams-01 have been operating ) its value typically ranges in the interval @xmath13 mv .",
    "none of those values , however , allows the conventional model considered in @xcite to perfectly match fermi - lat data ( see red lines in fig.[fig : elepos_242reac ] ) . assuming a steeper injection spectrum below few gev s , while allows to improve the fit of fermi - lat data , it overshoots considerably ams-01",
    ". such discrepancy may hard to be compensated even considering more complex charge dependent modulation set - up ( see e.g. @xcite ) . charge asymmetric modulation may also play a role explaining the discrepancy between the prediction of this model and low energy positron fraction pamela data @xcite .",
    "a better fit can be obtained assuming a steeper spectrum at high energy , @xmath14 rather than @xmath15 which worsen the fit of high energy fermi - lat data ( see blue line in fig . [",
    "fig : elepos_242reac ] ) but may still be compatible with the current statistical and systematic errors .",
    "forthcoming fermi - lat data and analysis will , therefore , be crucial . also this model ,",
    "however , face serious problems when compared with low energy positron fraction pamela data .    a consistent interpretation of all available experimental data in the framework of single component conventional cr propagation models is therefore still challenging .",
    "another viable interpretation of fermi - lat data consists in assuming the presence of two components in the cre spectrum .",
    "this possibility was already risen in @xcite and extensively discussed in @xcite and in a number of subsequent papers . in this scenario , an extra electron and positron component of astrophysical ( see e.g. @xcite ) or exotic origin ( see e.g. @xcite ) is added to the conventional one .",
    "the spectrum of the extra - component must be significantly harder that the conventional one and have an exponential cutoff at @xmath16 such to match high energy fermi - lat and h.e.s.s .",
    "data , while the low energy background electron should be softer than in the single component scenario .",
    "it was showed that if the extra - component is composed of electrons and positrons in comparable amount it allows to explain the rising behaviour of the positron fraction observed by pamela above @xmath17 . in @xcite it was already noted as such scenario also allows to improve the fit of low energy pre - fermi cre data , especially those taken by ams-01 , respect to the single component conventional model . in that paper an injection spectral index @xmath18 was adopted for the galactic @xmath6 conventional component .",
    "the new fermi - lat low energy data favour a steeper spectrum . as shown in fig.[fig : extra ] , the combination of galactic electron background with source spectral index @xmath19 , modulated in force - field approximation with @xmath20 , and an electron + positron extra component with source spectral index @xmath21 exponentially cut at 1 tev , provides an excellent fit of the whole cre spectrum measured by fermi - lat as well low energy ams-01 data and h.e.s.s .",
    "data above 1 tev .",
    "pamela positron fraction is also nicely reproduced above 10 gev while a small discrepancy remains below that energy ( see insert in fig.[fig : extra ] ) . in that figure",
    "the extra component source distribution has been assumed to coincide with that of galactic pulsars .",
    "we checked , however , that fermi and pamela data can also be reproduced with a source distribution which resemble that expected from dark - matter annihilation ( though with a slightly different choice of the relevant parameters ) .        a much better fit of low energy pamela data is obtained if a larger value of the diffusion coefficient spectral slope @xmath8 is adopted .",
    "for example we found that if @xmath22 ( kraichnan like diffusion ) as suggested by a recent analysis @xcite of cream b / c measurements @xcite and @xmath23 the whole pamela and fermi - lat data set can consistently be fitted ( the figures corresponding to that model will be showed elsewhere ) .",
    "as a specific realisation of such scenario we considered a model in which the extra electron and positron component is produced by galactic pulsars as illustrated in details in @xcite . observed pulsars within 3 kpc from the earth , as extracted from the atnf radio pulsar catalogue ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat/ ) , are accounted .",
    "we tested that adding more distant pulsars have negligible effects on our results .",
    "for each of those pulsars we use the spin - down luminosity given in the catalogue and randomly vary the relevant parameter in the following representative ranges : @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 production efficiency ) , @xmath27 ( delay of @xmath26 release respect to the pulsar birth ) and @xmath28 .",
    "these ranges of parameter are compatible with our observational and theoretical knowledge of particle acceleration in pwne .",
    "the electron+positron spectra expected for any of those realizations , as well as the predicted positron fraction , are shown in fig.[fig : pulsar_model ] in the case @xmath5 .",
    "it evident that are several realizations allowing to match all electron data as well as high energy pamela positron fraction data .",
    "we reported on possible interpretations for the cosmic ray electron - plus - positron ( cre ) spectrum measured by fermi - lat including preliminary new data extending down to @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we discussed the case of a single galactic electron component , and a two - component scenario which adds to the conventional electron flux a primary electron and positron component with a harder spectrum , which may be either of astrophysical or exotic origin .    in the single component scenario ,",
    "fermi - lat electron data can be approximatively be described if an injection spectral index between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is assumed ( for @xmath5 ) .",
    "those models , however , do not allow a perfect match of fermi - lat data either at low or at high energy .",
    "furthermore they are in sharp tension with the pamela data on the positron fraction .",
    "we therefore considered models adding an extra electron and positron component to the conventional electron galactic sea .",
    "we showed that such models allow to improve considerably the fit of fermi - lat , h.e.s.s . and ams-01 electon data as well as to account for the rising behaviour of the positron fraction observed , most conclusively , by pamela .",
    "the fermi lat collaboration acknowledges support from a number of agencies and institutes for both development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the nasa and the doe united states , cea / irfu and in2p3/cnrs in france , asi and infn in italy , mext , and the k. a. wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden . additional support from inaf in italy for science analysis during the operations phase is also gratefully acknowledged .",
