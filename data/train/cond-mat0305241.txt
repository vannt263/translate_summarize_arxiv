    "suppose that we have a data set arranged in a frequency distribution with @xmath5 classes .",
    "let @xmath6 be the frequency of animal groups observed in the @xmath7-th class ( where @xmath8 is the class width ) ; the class mark of group size , @xmath9 , is the midpoint of the class .",

    "@xmath15-mean is the average of the population distribution among group sizes , i.e. , the expected size of the groups in which an arbitrary individual engages .",
    "the population distribution is the crossover function from power - law to exponential decay .",
    "the empirical finding for fish school size suggests that the population distributions among school sizes are identical for fishes regardless of large diversities in behavioral and ecological conditions .",

    "fluctuations of the group size in aggregation - breakup processes , @xmath26 , are numerically determined as follows : assume for simulations that there are @xmath27 sites , coarse - grained zones of space , on which @xmath28 individuals move .",
    "the number of individuals , @xmath28 , is conserved .",
    "each site is either empty or occupied by one group . at each discrete time step , all groups move towards a randomly selected site .",
    "they may move to any site with equal probability .",
    "this corresponds to the mean - field theory .",
    "when @xmath29- and @xmath0-sized groups happen to move to the same site , they aggregate to form an @xmath30-sized group .",
    "each group with a size greater than or equal to 2 splits into a pair of groups with the probability @xmath31 at each time step .",
    "it is assumed that the probability @xmath31 for a group to split is independent of its size and that the sizes of splitting groups are uniformly distributed : a probability for an @xmath0-sized group to split into @xmath29- and @xmath32-sized groups is represented by @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "then , the expected decrement and increment of size of the group that a certain individual `` a '' rides are @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( i.e. , coarse - grained spatial population density ) at each time step , respectively .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of animal - group aggregation show that fluctuations of the group size in aggregation - breakup processes exponentially depend on the size ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) , and give @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the size of fluctuations .",
    "the same results can be obtained with another model for a group to split : the size distribution of splitting groups is binomial .",
    "@xmath39    let the domain of the size @xmath0 be real numbers .",

    "if the potential @xmath42 is continuously differentiable , the following relation is obtained : @xmath45 therefore the breakup rate @xmath17 , which corresponds to the dissipation in the stochastic differential equation , and the noise @xmath38 can not be independent .",
    "the numerical results indicate that this fluctuation - dissipation relation is already satisfied ( fig.[fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the stationary solution of eqn ( [ eqn : sde ] ) reads the probability for individual `` a '' to be found in @xmath0-sized groups , which is proportional to the stationary population distribution among group sizes , @xmath46 .",

    "there is no parameter to be adjusted , since @xmath15-mean is obtained directly from the data [ because of the fluctuation - dissipation relation , eqn ( [ eqn : fluct - dissip ] ) , parameters @xmath17 and @xmath38 do not explicitly appear in the group - size distribution ] . the self - consistency in the average of population distribution @xmath49\\mbox{d}q    }    } {    \\displaystyle {    \\int_0^{\\infty } \\exp    \\left[-q \\left ( 1-e^{-q}/2 \\right ) \\right]\\mbox{d}q    }    }    = 1\\ ] ]",
    "is numerically certified by using @xmath50-digit precision for internal computations , where @xmath51 .",
    "the model accounting for group - size statistics presented here is consistent with a number of numerical experiments .",
    "fig.[fig:4 ] represents the group - size distribution obtained from simulations .",
    "the model is tested with empirical data for the fish school - size distributions and a close agreement is found ( fig.[fig:5 ] ) .",
    "the normalization factor is given by @xmath52\\mbox{d}q \\right]^{-1 }   = 0.881237\\ ] ] the size distribution @xmath1 follows a power law with exponent @xmath16 to a cut - off size @xmath53 , i.e. , a well - defined mean of the associated distribution @xmath46 which is exponentially decaying function .",
    "naturally , a well - defined mean does not exist for the group - size distribution .",
    "moreover , a coarse - grained description of the group aggregation suggests that @xmath15-mean varies in proportion as the number of individuals or the spatial population density @xmath54 , and inversely as the breakup rate : @xmath55 which is numerically approved ( fig.[fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the group - size distribution , therefore , follows a universal scaling law , i.e. , it decays as a power law with an exponential truncation controlled not only by the system size ( number of individuals ) but also the breakup rate .",
    "i indeed find a collapse of the empirical data onto a single curve as well as the collapse of the numerical results .",
    "eqn ( [ eqn : popsize - pmean ] ) is utilized for data normalization ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "i have reconsidered some existing data on pelagic fishes and found identical statistical signatures : the school - size distribution follows a power - law decay with the exponent 1 up to a cut - off size which is given by @xmath15-mean .",
    "the rationale behind this robust scaling invariance is the exponential fluctuation of school - size change .",
    "i have proposed an ito stochastic differential equation governing the evolution of the group size that a certain individual rides , which is quite different approach from anderson s ( 1981 ) model based on a stochastic dynamics for the change of the number of individuals in a certain group .",
    "the model predicts not only the power - law behavior observed in nature , but also the deviation from pure power - law towards exponential decay .",
    "the similarity between the empirical distribution and the distribution obtained from the model is striking , though there is no fitting parameter .",
    "the exponential fluctuation of group size is the essential ingredient of underlying aggregate - breakup dynamics that influence animal group size .",
    "if the size fluctuation @xmath56 were proportional to the group size @xmath0 , the group - size distribution would follow a power - law decay with exponent 3/2 , as was suggested by @xcite .",
    "the interacting group systems introduced here have a marked feature in contrast to physical systems in thermal equilibrium : the aggregate - breakup process in animal - group systems does not allow for detailed balance as below ; while @xcite made the detailed balance assumptions in order to obtain the group - size distribution . the smoluchowski rate equation is the alternative equation governing the group - size distribution ( gueron & levin , 1995 ; gueron , 1998 ; durrett _ et al . _ , 1999 ) , and is equivalent to the following master equation for associated distribution of population @xcite : @xmath57 with the transition probability for a specific individual which engages in a group of size @xmath0 to pass into a group of size @xmath29 in a finite time interval @xmath21 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the probability for an @xmath0-sized group to join with an @xmath29-sized group in a finite time interval @xmath21 . whenever two groups meet",
    "they are supposed to join , which implies @xmath60 for a coarse - grained model of animal - group system .",
    "assume the detailed balance condition : there are as many transitions per @xmath21 from @xmath29-sized groups to @xmath0-sized groups as from @xmath0 to @xmath29 by the inverse process .",
    "the following recurrence formula for stationary solution is then obtained [ @xmath61 is given by eqn ( [ eqn : split - prob ] ) ] @xmath62 which leads to an explicit solution for group - size distribution @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the poisson distribution with mean @xmath65 .",
    "the result contradicts the simulated group - size distribution ; besides , eqn ( [ eqn : d - b - w ] ) violates the conservation law of population .",
    "the detailed balance conditions therefore do not hold in the aggregate - breakup systems , or else we may have another deterministic equation which is consistent with micro - reversibility . the model developed here can apply to a wide spectrum of cases on animal species .",
    "fig.[fig:7 ] shows the herd - size distributions for mammalian herbivores ; these distributions are much better fitted by a power law than by an exponential decay , as was suggested by @xcite .",
    "we may however notice that the empirical data are not in perfect agreement with eqn ( [ w - distr ] ) .",
    "it may be explained by biases in the data .",
    "another possibility bringing a subtle difference between data and theory is that the uniform - breakup assumption ( splitting probability independent of group size ) is no longer valid .",
    "there is yet another possibility .",
    "this subtle difference may be caused by the fluctuation - dissipation relation reduced above .",
    "it can be generalized as follows : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and potential @xmath42 is no longer differentiable at @xmath68 but continuous ( fig.[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the population distribution among group sizes is then modified into @xmath69\\ ] ] which guarantees the self - consistency in the average of distribution as well as eqn ( [ eqn : s - consist ] ) . the modified size distribution by adopting eqn ( [ eqn : g - fluct - dissip ] ) matches better the data . yet",
    ", the modified distribution [ eqn ( [ eqn : g - p - distr ] ) ] can apply to schools of sardinellas caught in the up - welling areas @xcite , and the agreement between the empirical distribution and the model s prediction is remarkable ( fig.[fig:8 ] ) .",
