    "<S> we present a method to correct the magnetic properties of itinerant systems in local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and we apply it to the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition under pressure in a typical itinerant system , ni@xmath0al . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a scaling of the critical fluctuations as a function of pressure equivalent to the one obtained within moryia s theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we show that in this material the role of the bandstructure is crucial in driving the transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally we calculate the magnetic moment as a function of pressure , and find that it gives a scaling of the curie temperature that is in good agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the method can be easily extended to the antiferromagnetic case and applied , for instance , to the fe - pnictides in order to correct the lsda magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory ( dft ) , in its most common implementations ( local spin density approximation , lsda , with or without gradient corrections , gga ) , is in principle the only way to access the ground state of real materials .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and indeed the agreement with experiment concerning the ground state properties , such as crystal and electronic structures , is excellent , especially for itinerant system , where local correlations play a minor role . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a well known problem of lsda is the overestimation of the tendency to magnetism in itinerant magnets near the quantum critical point ( qcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be traced down to the fact that lsda is essentially a mean field theory , which does not take into account a detrimental effect of near - critical fluctuations on the long - range magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while the itinerant nature of systems like feal ,  @xcite pd  @xcite or the more recent and better known fe - pnictides ,  singh1,greenpaglione , liliaole make lda and gga reproduce very well the paramagnetic bandstructure , whenever a ( magnetic ) quantum critical point ( qcp ) is approached the theory fails miserably . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of this problem is demonstrated by the amount of papers dealing with the problem of correcting the magnetic moment of fe - pnicitides .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite there , the usual argument is that correlations beyond mean field suppress the ( lsda ) local ordered moment . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that one can reduce the calculated magnetic moment by using the lda+u method with a negative u  @xcite , but there is no physical justification for this procedure . </S>",
    "<S> such many - body approaches as dynamic mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and gutzwiller  @xcite were also successfully used ; since these methods introduce additional fluctuations into the system , they obviously work in the right direction . </S>",
    "<S> however , the concept of substituting long - range critical fluctuations by the on - site ones is rather questionable .  </S>",
    "<S> petukhov furthermore the effect of non - local fluctuations was recently found to be crucial , also in localized models , whenever the critical behavior is analyzed@xcite , and in any event computational load in these methods is incomparably heavier than in lda calculations .    for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> we propose a different approach which corrects lsda within dft and takes into account the itinerant nature of the system . </S>",
    "<S> our method is easy to implement ,  @xcite carries no additional computational cost , and has a transparent physical justification . </S>",
    "<S> the approach we describe in the following is based on the idea that unknown more accurate dft is very close to the conventional lsda - gga functional , but the energy gain due to spin polarization ( stoner interaction , using the dft parlance ) is reduced by about as much as the moriya selfconsistent renormalization ( scr ) theory  moriya1 , successfully used before  @xcite , suggests . for this reason we call it reduced stoner theory ( rst ) . in fact we show that there is a one to one and well defined connection between our method and the moriya scr theory in accounting for the effect of spin fluctuations in itinerant magnets . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to make an _ ab - initio _ prediction of the magnetic moment as a function of pressure for the archetypical ni@xmath0al itinerant ferromagnet , with the correct scaling of the curie temperature , which until now was impossible . for ni@xmath0al </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the effect of spin fluctuations on physical properties both in the magnetic state ( magnetic moment and susceptibility ) and in the paramagnetic one ( dc resistivity ) was demonstrated both theoretically  ni3alni3ga , quantitativemoryia1 and experimentally .  </S>",
    "<S> ni3al - magnetic1,lonzarich    applying the rst we estimate the pressure dependence of the contribution due to spin fluctuations on the magnetic moment of ni@xmath0al . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly we find that this contribution is almost pressure independent . </S>",
    "<S> this means that spin fluctuations only act in shifting the stoner condition . </S>",
    "<S> the rest is done by the bandstructure . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> we show that the way in which the spin fluctuations renormalize the effective stoner interaction is encoded in the bandstructure itself . </S>",
    "<S> this is generally true but in ni@xmath0al it becomes particularly evident due to the perfect scaling of the density of states ( dos ) with pressure .    </S>",
    "<S> having established a link between the rst and the scr theory indeed , we are able to give a reliable estimate of the stoner parameter in itinerant magnets . moreover if one reverses the logic a comparison between the experiment and the rst results gives an easy and reliable estimate of the spin fluctuations acting in the system . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we present the bare lsda results for ni@xmath0al under pressure and we interpret them within the so - called extended stoner theory ( est ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we explain that the overestimation of both the magnetic moment at zero pressure , and the critical pressure @xmath1 come essentially by the overestimation of the stoner parameter in lsda . </S>",
    "<S> after that we introduce the formalism for correcting the lsda behavior and we present the scaling equations used in the rst . in the last part of the paper we apply these scaling equations to the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition of ni@xmath0al under pressure .    </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the bare lda ( and lsda ) results for the magnetic transition in ni@xmath0al under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> ni@xmath0al crystallizes in the ideal cubic cu@xmath0au @xmath2 structure . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the equilibrium lattice parameter @xmath3   in lda  @xcite and we found it to be @xmath4 smaller than the experimental one .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the calculated magnetic moment at @xmath5 gpa is @xmath6 @xmath7 in lsda ( @xmath8 @xmath9 in gga ) in reasonable agreement with previous results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after that we calculated the magnetic moment as a function of pressure and , as shown in the top of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosdip ] , we found that it decreases approximately linearly up to the critical pressure @xmath10 gpa , much larger than the experimental one , which is @xmath11 gpa .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this behavior can be easily understood within the est .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in fact , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosdip ] ( bottom ) , the paramagnetic dos @xmath12 calculated in lda scales almost perfectly with the pressure @xmath13 as : @xmath14 in a wide energy range around the fermi level taken as the origin , where @xmath15 with p measured in gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this can be related to magnetization @xmath16 the est  extended , krasko , extended2 , which combines the stoner criterion with the andersen s force theorem to show that in the lowest order in the magnetic moment @xmath17 the total lsda energy is given in terms of the non magnetic dos per spin : @xmath18where @xmath19 is the extended dos defined in ref .   as the average dos over an energy interval equal to the exchange splitting at a given @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the stoner parameter . </S>",
    "<S> stationary solutions appear where @xmath22 and @xmath23 , forming a stable or a metastable ( metamagnetic ) ferromagnetic state with the magnetic moment @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath12 scales according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pscale ] , so does also @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> comparing eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ edim ] with the fixed spin moment calculation we found the stoner parameter in lsda to be @xmath25 ev independent on pressure ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in gga the stoner parameter is 17% larger , @xmath26 . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will consider only the lsda results . around </S>",
    "<S> the minimum of @xmath27 @xmath24 decreases monotonically . </S>",
    "<S> thus a reduction of @xmath21 shifts the stoner condition [ @xmath28 toward a smaller magnetic moment , bringing the lsda results in agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to find a way for reducing the lsda stoner parameter and getting in this way the correct magnetic moment in itinerant systems . in order to gain some understanding of how the standard lsda needs to be corrected to account for spin fluctuations , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall the scr theory for critical ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> it starts with the ginzburg - landau expansion , @xmath29where @xmath30 is the magnetic moment and @xmath31 is the lsda energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is then assumed that @xmath30 fluctuates around the average value @xmath32 so that @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that @xmath34 follows a gaussian distribution such that @xmath35 we can rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ edim ] in terms of @xmath36 as @xmath37where the explicit formula for the renormalized coefficients is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , and the second order coefficient , @xmath38 if we restrict our expansion by the second order , this scr procedure is equivalent to renormalizing spin susceptibility .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the spin fluctuations , @xmath39 in principle , can be obtained by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) : @xmath40where @xmath41 is the volume of the unit cell .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath42 in this formula is often expressed in terms of the noninteracting ( lindhard ) susceptibility , which in turn is expanded to the lowest order in @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be written down as functions of the fermi velocity , averaged over the fermi surface . however , in order to calculate @xmath48 using this expression one needs to apply a cutoff @xmath49 which is not a well defined quantity .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now point out that the uniform spin susceptibility in the lsda can be written in a particularly simple form , namely @xmath50 $ ] ( this can be considered as a rigorous definition of the lsda stoner parameter @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the paramagnetic dos per spin . comparing this expression with the one for @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> we see that the scr procedure is equivalent to renormalization of @xmath21 according to @xmath54 which can also be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( see also appendix  [ appendix ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this is a justification of the recipe of using @xmath21 as an adjustable parameter  @xcite , often used in critical ferromagnets empirically . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath57 can be perceived as derivable from an unknown more accurate dft , in a specific material . </S>",
    "<S> one can also reverse - engineer  such an improved functional , using the standard von bart - hedin scaling , @xmath58where @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not depend on @xmath20 and @xmath62 is a known function , and @xmath63 @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the response to magnetism is entirely defined by the @xmath61 functional , as the energy difference between the fully polarized and unpolarized electron gas:@xmath65note that the charge potential also acquires a term that disappears when @xmath66 in this sense , it is impossible in a physically meaningful way to reverse - engineer @xmath67 and @xmath68 in such a way that @xmath69 be scaled by a constant factor @xmath70 and @xmath71 would remain the same . </S>",
    "<S> rather , a natural way to weaken the magnetism in this formalism is to scale @xmath72 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ vbh2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> then we will have the following set of scaled equations : @xmath73 \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scale ] can be easily implemented  @xcite and can be used to obtain correct magnetic moments and the corresponding electronic structure in the materials near ferro _ _ or antiferro__magnetic qcp . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> given eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fdt ] and  [ i ] @xmath77 gives also an indication of the strength of spin fluctuations acting in the system . </S>",
    "<S> below we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scale ] for correcting the lsda results obtained in the previous section in the case of ni@xmath0al itinerant ferromagnet under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> as shown previously , ni@xmath0al becomes paramagnetic under pressure  ni3al - magnetic1 and lsda overestimates not only the magnetic moment , but also the critical pressure @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> empirically , by comparing the lsda value of the magnetic moment with the experimental one for @xmath5 gpa and for @xmath78 gpa , we found that in both cases the value of @xmath77 needed to reconcile the lsda result with experiment , using the scaling introduced in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scale ] , is @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath48 is almost pressure - independent between 0 and 6 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath77 gives for @xmath80 the same value obtained by renormalizing @xmath21 within the est ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in general , one expects that spin fluctuations become stronger closer to the critical pressure , so that their average amplitude @xmath48 becomes larger , and the scaling parameter @xmath81 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ i ] smaller . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath48 is defined by averaging over the entire brillouin zone , and the fact that susceptibility at one particular point @xmath82 diverges may or may not strongly affect @xmath48 . in order to understand this result , we compared our calculations with ref .  , where @xmath48 is calculated for @xmath5 gpa in the approximations described above . by means of scaling arguments described below , we found that the transition is driven entirely by the change in dos given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pscale ] while the renormalized stoner parameter @xmath57 is , in the first approximation , pressure independent . </S>",
    "<S> let us try to rationalize this fact , using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ fdt ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> given eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pscale ] , and since the fermi velocity scales inversely with the dos , @xmath83 , in the approximation described in the beginning , and used in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> , we found that @xmath48 does actually scale with pressure as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the unit cell volume at pressure @xmath13 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we found indeed that it does not diverge or even grow substantially near the critical pressure ( even though the model susceptibility at @xmath86 @xmath87 does diverge there , @xmath88 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is particularly important because it tells us that the effect of spin fluctuations in ni@xmath89al under pressure can be entirely accounted for by renormalizing the stoner factor ( the rest is a bandstructure effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the fact that the correlation length associated with the fluctuations ( @xmath48 ) does not diverge approaching the transition , is compatible with the fact that the system does not show other instabilities ( like triplet superconductivity ) at @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact if @xmath48 would go to infinity , another ( competing ) instability could profit of this kind of long range correlation in order to build up a competing order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath91 which implies that @xmath48 changes only by 2% . applying the scr theory starting from the fixed spin moment calculations and using @xmath48 as a parameter ( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) , we found that the best agreement with the experiment was achieved if @xmath48 changes slightly more , by 5% , but simply using a pressure - independent @xmath48 , corresponding to the scaling parameter @xmath92 , provides , apart from some underestimation of @xmath1 , a very reasonable agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath77 allows us also to make predictions about the magnetic moment between @xmath93 and @xmath94 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mvsp ] .    </S>",
    "<S> there are no experimental measurements of magnetization as a function of pressure between @xmath93 and @xmath95 gpa in ni@xmath0al , but the pressure dependence of the curie temperature @xmath96 was measured by nicklovic _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite they also analyzed the data using a landau functional for the field@xmath97by assuming @xmath98 they found @xmath99 in good agreement with the experimental data . </S>",

    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dosdip ] , in lsda ( for large values of the magnetic moment ) we found @xmath111 while @xmath112 is recovered for small values ( see fig  [ mvsp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that at large magnetic moment the coefficient @xmath104 must be corrected by adding high order terms . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using moriya s relation for @xmath96 we find @xmath113 in full agreement with nicklovic _ </S>",

    "<S> the disagreement with experiment in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mvsp ] ( inset ) concerns only the underestimation of @xmath1 caused by : the approximation of @xmath77 as a constant value and the underestimation of the equilibrium lattice parameter .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to summarize , in this paper we have described a simplified method for accounting for near - critical spin - fluctuations within the dft . </S>",
    "<S> the method amounts to scaling the dft exchange - correlation field by a phenomenological constant @xmath77 , and subsequent self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham equations . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenological constant can also be , in principle , calculated via the fluctuation dissipation theorem  @xcite , and in this sense is equivalent to the scr theory by moriya . </S>",
    "<S> our method is complementary to the widely used similarly semi - phenomenological lda+u , and plays for itinerant near - critical magnets the same role as lda+u for systems near a mott - hubbard transition . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to the ferromagnetic qcp in ni@xmath0al under pressure . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , due to a particular scaling property of the bandstructure , the parameter @xmath77 is constant with pressure . in this way </S>",
    "<S> the method becomes completely _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio_. in fact , the ferromagnetic - paramagetic transition in ni@xmath0al is driven by the band structure changes under pressure , while the feedback to the critical fluctuations ( parameterized by @xmath77 ) is small . using this formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we make a prediction of the magnetic moment as a function of pressure , which recovers the critical exponent for the magnetization @xmath114 for small magnetic moments and explains the observed dependence of the curie temperature on pressure </S>",
    "<S> . the new method should be useful in cases when one needs to calculate electronic properties of materials where lsda overestimates the tendency to magnetism , or when one wants to monitor theoretically the evolution of the electronic structure from non magnetic to magnetic and get an estimate of the spin fluctuation amplitude .    </S>",
