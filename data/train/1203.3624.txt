    ", the authors in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite apply different methods to obtain various conclusions .",
    "the conclusions they obtained overlap , but do not cover each other . in this article ,",
    "in addition to extending the known results to a larger domain of indices , in particular the case @xmath50 , we also give a unified proof of the results of @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite in either subcritical case or critical case .",
    "note that the nonlinearity is locally lipschitz continuous when @xmath51 , and locally hlder continuous when @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , we have to use the different argument in cases @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "firstly , we show the results on the subcritical case :    [ bg1 ] let @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and assume @xmath56 given @xmath57 and @xmath7 , unconditional uniqueness holds in @xmath58 for .",

    "it is not difficult to verify that the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( for @xmath44 and @xmath69 ) are covered by theorem  [ bg1 ] and theorem  [ ls1 ] .",
    "the conclusions of @xcite are also included in our results when @xmath70 .",
    "the strategy of our proof is similar to the one used by furioli and terraneo in @xcite , and it makes use of the negative order homogeneous besov space @xmath71 and sobolev space @xmath72 respectively . for the choice of @xmath73 , in addition to that used by furioli and terraneo in @xcite , we can also select different indices . generally speaking , if @xmath74 are two solutions of , in order that @xmath75 , the relationship @xmath76 is natural by the embedding @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "however , the difference of two solutions sometimes has better regularity in certain spaces than each of the solutions .",
    "we show this better regularity for the subcritical case in the part  3.2 and for the critical case in the part  4.3.1 .",
    "we also use nonhomogeneous strichartz estimates , which are different from those used in @xcite .",
    "furioli and terraneo applied the classical strichartz estimates : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the schrdinger group and @xmath81 , and the pairs @xmath82 satisfy the admissibility conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , in order to make the selected @xmath73 part of an admissible pair , the condition @xmath86 should be satisfied . furthermore , furioli and terraneo only settled the case @xmath87 , where the nonlinearity is locally lipschitz continuous . their method does not apply to the case @xmath50 , when the nonlinearity is not locally lipschitz .",
    "we apply the general strichartz estimates , which are described in lemma  [ non - str - est ] , @xmath73 being restricted to be part of a  general \" admissible pair .",

    "our restrictions on @xmath88 , for instance given by - or when @xmath51 and - or - when @xmath50 , corresponding to the different choices @xmath73 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath89 , in light of - , we may choose @xmath90 , which is the choice made by win and tsutsumi in @xcite .",
    "for the case @xmath50 , we use the fractional chain rule for a hlder continuous function ( lemma  [ fcrfahcf ] ) , then a result similar to lemma  2.3 in @xcite is obtained , which is applied to control the nonlinearity . from the proof of the case @xmath51 , we can see that the bound @xmath91 comes from the condition @xmath92 , which ensures to hold . a similar argument",
    "can be used in the case @xmath50 .",
    "we also consider the critical cases in the following results :    [ cri1 ] let @xmath46 and @xmath42 with @xmath93 or @xmath44 with @xmath94 . given @xmath57 and @xmath7 , unconditional uniqueness holds in @xmath58 for .",

    "given @xmath57 and @xmath7 , unconditional uniqueness holds in @xmath13;\\dot{h}^s)$ ] for .",
    "it follows from theorem [ cri1 ] and [ cri2 ] that unconditional uniqueness in the critical case is left open in the following cases :    case a : :    @xmath42 , @xmath101 and @xmath67 ; case b : :    @xmath44 , @xmath46 and    @xmath102 or @xmath103 ; case c : :    @xmath96 , @xmath49 and    @xmath104 ; case d : :    @xmath65 , @xmath49 and    @xmath105 .",
    "note that theorem  [ cri1 ] states uniqueness of solutions in @xmath106 , while theorem  [ cri2 ] states uniqueness for solutions in a stronger sense , i.e. solutions in @xmath107;\\dot h^s)$ ] .",
    "the fundamental reason is that , under the assumptions of theorem 1.5 , when estimating the difference of two solutions , there comes a factor of @xmath108 in the right - had side .",
    "so we can choose @xmath108 sufficiently small so that the right hand side is absorbed by the left hand side .",
    "however , under the assumptions of theorem [ cri2 ] , the coefficient is no longer dependent on time .",
    "a similar difficulty appears in @xcite and @xcite . using an argument inspired by @xcite",
    ", we divide the nonlinearity by high - low frequencies and use the norms @xmath109 , where the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath73 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are chosen in section  4 .    _ _ * notation:*__@xmath114 is the sobolev space and @xmath4 is the homogeneous sobolev space , see section  6.2 and section  6.3 of @xcite respectively .",

    "finally , we present four figures at the end of the paper , displaying in dimensions @xmath44 , @xmath96 , @xmath30 and @xmath117 , respectively , the various regions where unconditional uniqueness is known or is still an open problem .",
    "in this section , we present some lemmas which we need .",

    "this estimate extends results of strichartz @xcite , ginibre and velo @xcite , yajima @xcite , cazenave and weissler @xcite , keel and tao @xcite .",
    "we say that the pair @xmath118 is @xmath119-acceptable if @xmath120    [ non - str - est ] given any @xmath121 , the following properties holds :    let @xmath122 be an interval of @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . if @xmath118 is a @xmath119-acceptable pair and @xmath126 , then for every @xmath119-acceptable pair @xmath127 , there exists a constant @xmath128 independent of @xmath122 such that @xmath129 when @xmath130 and @xmath131 verify the scaling condition @xmath132 and satisfy one of the following sets of conditions :    * if @xmath42 , we also require that @xmath133 ; * if @xmath39 , we distinguish two cases ,    -non sharp case : @xmath134    -sharp case : @xmath135    the sobolev space can be replaced by besov space , where the conditions @xmath136 have to hold .    the estimate without derivatives follows from @xcite .",
