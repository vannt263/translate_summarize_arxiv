    "even though fusion cross sections reflect the dynamical behavior of the nuclei involved in the fusion @xcite , apparently it is incapable to get insights into the interaction mechanism between nuclei simply by measuring fusion cross sections .",
    "that is , theoretical calculations , such as coupled - channels calculations ( either semi - classical or quantal ) , are indispensable in order to understand the fusion dynamics @xcite .",
    "these calculations , in comparison with the experimental data , address the influence of coupling between the relative motion and the nuclear intrinsic degrees of freedom , and thus the interplay between nuclear structure and reaction dynamics @xcite . as a result , the coupled - channels formalism has become a powerful and standard tool in order to interpret experimental fusion cross sections@xcite .",
    "one of the most important ingredients of such calculations is an inter - nuclear potential .",
    "various types of potential , such as a double folding potential @xcite and a phenomenological woods - saxon potential @xcite , have been employed . among these , the woods - saxon form , described by the depth parameter , @xmath3 , the radius parameter , @xmath4 , and the surface diffuseness parameter , @xmath5 , has gained popularity due to its simplicity and ability to reproduce many experimental results . while representing the woods - saxon potential",
    ", its depth and radius parameters can be mutually adjusted to reproduce the coulomb barrier of the system once the surface diffuseness parameter is fixed .",
    "obtaining the quantitative measure for the surface diffuseness parameter is therefore of crucial importance , as the curvature of the coulomb barrier is largely determined by the surface diffuseness parameter , which by definition reflects the surface property of the internuclear potential .",
    "three different methods have been used in literature in order to extract a diffuseness parameter from experimentally measured data .",
    "the first method is to analyze elastic scattering cross sections either with an optical potential model or with a coupled - channels approach .",
    "this methods has established a value of surface diffuseness to be around 0.6 fm for most of the systems @xcite .",
    "the second method is to use high precision fusion cross section .",
    "it has turned out that this method leads to a much larger value of surface diffuseness parameter , ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 fm , than the first method @xcite .",
    "recently , hagino et al .",
    "have proposed the third method , which uses a quasi - elastic ( qe ) excitation function at large backward angles @xcite .",
    "they have suggested that at energies well below the coulomb barrier , a qe excitation function is sensitive mainly to the surface property of nuclear potential and can be used to obtain quantitatively the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "this method leads to the diffuseness parameter for spherical systems to be around 0.6 fm @xcite , while somewhat larger values of the diffuseness parameter have been obtained for systems involving deformed nuclei .",
    "the different values of surface diffuseness parameter , obtained for spherical and deformed systems , lead to a realization that not only obtaining the quantitative measure of diffuseness but also understanding how the coupling affects the surface diffuseness is of importance . for this purpose ,",
    "several studies have been carried out in aiming at understanding the effects of different couplings on the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "gasques et al .",
    "@xcite have performed both the single - channel ( sc ) and the coupled - channels ( cc ) calculations for @xmath6s+@xmath7pb , @xmath8au , @xmath9w , and @xmath10eu systems and concluded that the rotation coupling shows a significant influence on the diffuseness parameter value .",
    "see also ref .",
    "washiyama et al .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the qe measurements for @xmath11o , @xmath12s+ @xmath7pb systems with the single - channel calculations .",
    "they did not obtain any enhancement in the value of surface diffuseness parameter , and thus a significant effect of vibrational coupling on the diffuseness parameter was not observed .",
    "studies on many other systems , such as @xmath13o+ @xmath14mo @xcite , have also shown similar results .",
    "hence , it has generally been considered that the vibrational excitation has a marginal effect on the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate further the effect of vibrational excitations on the surface diffuseness parameter . as in the rotational excitations",
    ", one may expect that the effect becomes more significant when the vibrational excitation energy is small .",
    "furthermore , we also investigate the effect of transfer coupling , which has been established to play an important role in the fusion dynamics @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no study has reported concerning how the transfer coupling affects the diffuseness parameter .",
    "for these purposes , we re - analyze the experimental data for @xmath15c+@xmath1pd systems reported in ref .",
    "@xcite using the coupled - channels approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first discuss the characteristic feature of the @xmath15c+@xmath1pd systems with respect to the vibrational and the transfer couplings .",
    "we then detail the procedure to extract the surface diffuseness parameter through the analyses of the quasi - elastic data . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the results of our analyses and discuss the role of vibrational and transfer couplings .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper in sec . iv .",
    "in order to study the effect of vibrational coupling on a surface diffuseness parameter , we re - analyze the experimental quasi - elastic scattering for the @xmath15c+@xmath16pd systems , for which the data have been available in ref .",
    "@xcite . while ref .",
    "@xcite focused on extracting the barrier distributions , our aim in this paper is to extract the surface diffuseness parameter using the deep - subbarrier data .",
    "we choose these systems as the target nuclei , @xmath1pd , exhibit low - energy vibrational excitations ( @xmath17 @xmath18 0.5 mev for the first excited state in @xmath19pd ) .",
    "the projectile , @xmath2c , along with the chosen target , is an ideal candidate to study the effect of transfer coupling due to the following characteristics :    1 .",
    "positive q - values for one - neutron transfer channels ( see table [ tab : q - value ] ) , which are necessary for a system to exhibit significant influences of a neutron transfer coupling @xcite .",
    "2 .   the existence of the weakly bound valence nucleon , which ensures the transfer of neutron .",
    "vibrational couplings in the target nuclei , which are in general weaker as compared to rotational couplings so that the effect of transfer may not be significantly masked .    in our systematic study",
    ", we carry out the coupled - channels calculations by including the vibrational couplings in the target nuclei in order to understand the influence of the vibrational coupling on the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath0c + @xmath1pd systems have a negative q - value for the neutron pick - up reactions ( see table [ tab : q - value ] ) , a comparison with the @xmath2c + @xmath1pd systems will elucidate the role of transfer coupling in the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    ".[tab : q - value ] the q - value for the neutron transfer channels for the @xmath15c+@xmath1pd systems , given in units of mev . here",
    "the negative and positive signs correspond to the pick - up and stripping reactions , respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     naturally , one can expect that the energy of the excited state correlates with the deformation parameter .",
    "that is , the larger the deformation parameter is , the smaller the excitation energy will be .",
    "the table [ tab : beta ] shows the energy of the first excited state of various nuclei considered in this paper as well as those in literature . it can be observed from the table that those nuclei which exhibit a large channel coupling effect on surface diffuseness parameter have a small excitation energy of the first excited state , i.e. , @xmath20 mev . in contrast ,",
    "the first vibrational state of @xmath7pb is at 2.615 mev , and thus the channel coupling effect is much smaller .    evidently , it is both @xmath21 and @xmath17 which are responsible for the influence of channel coupling effect on the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "the nature of coupling scheme , that is , the rotational versus vibrational , is unimportant with respect to the influence on the diffuseness .      in the coupled - channels calculation shown in the previous subsection ,",
    "the couplings to the quadrupole vibrational states are considered .",
    "if these were the only dominant channels , one would expect that the extracted surface diffuseness parameters were similar among the systems .",
    "[ fig : apat ] shows the diffuseness parameter extracted with the single - channel ( the open symbols ) and the coupled - channels ( the filled symbols ) calculations as a function of the mass product of the projectile and the target nuclei , @xmath22 .",
    "it can be observed from the figure that the diffuseness parameter is reduced as the projectile isotope is changed from @xmath0c to @xmath2c ( with the same target isotope ) or the target isotope is changed from @xmath23pd to @xmath24pd ( with the same projectile isotope ) .",
    "this gives us a hint that there could be an effect of channel coupling involved other than the collective quadrupole excitations .",
    "as we have discussed in sec .",
    "ii , the transfer channel is a promising candidate for this , since a large probability of transfer is expected for @xmath2c due to the presence of the valence neutron .",

    "[ fig : a - trans ] the optimum value of surface diffuseness parameter as a function of the q - value for neutron transfer .",
    "since for the present systems , the two - neutron ( 2n ) transfer is a second step process , the most important transfer channel is a one - neutron ( 1n ) transfer which may not be a general case . hence , we have plotted the surface diffuseness as a function of the q - value for the 1n transfer channels . for the 1n transfer channels , we have considered the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 channels for the @xmath0c and @xmath2c projectile nuclei , respectively",
    "these would be most preferable transfer channels from the point of view of the transfer @xmath27-value , although the @xmath25 channel may be equally important for the @xmath2c+@xmath24pd system .",
    "it can be observed from the figure that , as a general trend , the surface diffuseness decreases as the transfer @xmath27-value increases .",
    "this might indicate that the difference in the surface diffuseness parameter between the @xmath0c projectile and the @xmath2c projectile could be attributed to the influence of neutron transfer coupling .",
    "it would be an intriguing future work to confirm this conjecture by carrying out coupled - channels calculations including both the collective excitations and the neutron transfer channels , although it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "( color online ) same as fig .",
    "[ fig : apat ] , but as a function of the @xmath27-value for the neutron transfer channels .",
    "the lines are to guide the eye . ]",
    "the value of surface diffuseness parameter in the internuclear potential for the @xmath0c + @xmath1pd and @xmath2c + @xmath1pd systems has been extracted from the measured quasi - elastic scattering cross sections at a backward angle . to this end , both the single - channel calculations and the coupled - channels calculations including the quadrupole vibrational excitations in the target nuclei have been carried out . even though the systems studied involve spherical nuclei , the comparison of the coupled - channels calculations with the single - channel calculations revealed the reduction in the values of the diffuseness parameter .",
    "a similar reduction had been reported earlier for deformed systems due to the rotational coupling . evidently , the conclusion in refs .",
    "@xcite that the vibrational excitation has a marginal effect on the surface diffuseness parameter is not a general one , but instead , the effect becomes significant even for the vibrational coupling when the coupling is strong enough .",
    "we have argued that the reduction in the extracted diffuseness parameter is due to the strong coupling to the low - lying collective states , and the nature of coupling is not important .",
    "that is , the reduction can be observed both for the rotational and the vibrational couplings as long as the coupling strength is large enough .",
    "furthermore , a discussion has been made in order to understand the influence of the transfer coupling on the surface diffuseness parameter .",
    "we have observed that the surface diffuseness parameter gets smaller as the transfer @xmath27-value increases .",
    "this implies that the surface diffuseness tends to be smaller when the transfer coupling is stronger .",
    "it would be an interesting future work to confirm whether this trend holds in other systems as well .",
    "for that purpose , it would be interesting also to perform coupled - channels calculations including the transfer degree of freedom and carry out systematic studies in order to clarify the interplay between the collective excitations and the transfer couplings .",
