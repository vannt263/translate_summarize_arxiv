    "in the last decade , the use of equivalent widths ( ews ) of balmer absorption lines in the integrated spectra of old stellar populations ( sps ) has become a standard procedure for estimating their light - weighted mean ages ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "the rationale of the method is to utilize the sensitivity of balmer lines to the temperature and luminosity of turn - off stars , which depend strongly on the age of a sp .",
    "however , a well known caveat is the existence of old hot stars that may be sufficiently bright and numerous to boost the ews of balmer lines , mimicking the signature of young stars in the integrated spectra of old sps .",
    "that is the case of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , which are present in such old systems as galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) with a range of metallicities ( see moehler 2001 for a review ) , the halo and bulge fields ( e.g. kinman et al .",
    "2000 ) , the cores of local group galaxies ( brown et al .  1998 ; brown et al .",
    "2000 ; brown 2003 ) , and old galactic clusters like ngc  6791 ( e.g. peterson & green 1998 ) .",
    "so far the only way of unequivocally distinguishing between an old sp that hosts bhb stars from a truly young sp is by construction of color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , which of course can only be achieved for nearby systems , within the local group .",
    "theoretical studies ( freitas pacheco & barbuy 1995 ; lee et al .",
    "2000 ; maraston & thomas 2000 ) have shown that the impact of bhb stars on the integrated spectra of old sps can be significant , and in particular it may affect the ages inferred from the ews of balmer lines . however , in view of the lingering theoretical uncertainties regarding the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) and its connection with mass loss on the red giant branch ( catelan 2000 ) , an accurate assessment of the contribution of bhb stars to the integrated optical light of old sps still depends on the availability of cmds .    in this _",
    "we present the first results of an ongoing project to calibrate our sp synthesis models with high quality integrated spectra of star clusters . while this has already been attempted by a number of groups ( beasley et al .",
    "2002 ; schiavon et al .",
    "2002a , b ; puzia et al.2002 ; maraston et al .  2003 ; leonardi & rose 2003 ) , our work benefits from the combination of a homogeneous set of high s / n integrated gc spectra newly collected by our group , with the hst cmds of several tens of galactic gcs , most of them reaching the gc turn - off , by piotto et al.(2002 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the ability of well - calibrated models , combined with high s / n spectra , to single out the contribution of bhb stars to the integrated light of gcs .",
    "we use a combination of an fe - sensitive index and an index comprised of the ratio of two balmer line ews to uniquely constrain the bhb contribution to the integrated light .",
    "this enables us to distinguish , _ purely on the basis of their integrated spectra _ , truly intermediate - age or young clusters from those which are old , but whose",
    "balmer lines are strengthened by the contaminating light of bhb stars .",
    "we envisage a direct application of our method to studies of extragalactic gc systems , where the determination of gc ages and metal abundances can yield insight into the star formation and merger histories of the host galaxies ( e.g. cohen , blakeslee & ct 2003 ; larsen et al .",
    "2003 ; hempel et al .",
    "we collected integrated spectra for 40 galactic gcs with the r - c spectrograph on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio in april 2003 .",
    "we scanned a 5to 1pt.to 2pt5-long slit across the core diameter of each target gc .",
    "for the gcs located towards the bulge , on - target exposures were interspersed with raster scans of adjacent sky regions @xmath45away from the gc centers . the instrumental setup consisted of grating kpgl1 , with 632 l / mm , and a loral ccd with 3k @xmath5 1k 15@xmath6m - sized pixels .",
    "the resulting spectra cover the range 33656435@xmath3 with 2.8@xmath3 fwhm resolution .",
    "the exposure times were scaled to yield spectra with s / n @xmath2 100 per resolution element .",
    "data reduction used standard iraf routines for longslit spectra .",
    "final 1d integrated spectra were obtained by extracting an aperture covering the core diameter along the slit direction .",
    "since the exposures were trailed over a core diameter perpendicular to the slit , the resulting 1d spectra are representative of the stellar content in the cores of the gcs . the spectra were flux calibrated using observations of flux standards taken throughout the observing run .",
    "the 1d integrated spectra had their resolution degraded to match that of the lick / ids system , and ews of absorption lines were measured following the definitions of worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and worthey & ottaviani ( 1997 ) .",
    "consistency with the lick / ids index system was achieved by comparing ews measured in spectra of standard lick / ids stars , taken throughout the observing run , with standard values from worthey et al .",
    "in order to highlight the impact of hb morphology on the integrated light , we restrict our analysis to gcs with [ fe / h ] @xmath7 , because at higher metallicities all gcs have similar red hbs , therefore not adding much to our discussion . a plot of @xmath0  vs. [ fe / h ] for this sub - sample is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . for most of the gcs , [ fe / h ]",
    "values were taken from kraft & ivans ( 2003 ) .",
    "those values were supplemented , whenever needed , by data from carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) , idiart , thvenin & freitas pacheco ( 1997 ) , and harris ( 1996 ) . throughout this _ letter _",
    "gcs are subdivided in terms of hb morphology , with @xmath8 , as follows : gcs with _",
    "mostly blue _ hbs ( @xmath9 ) , gcs with _ mostly red _ hbs ( @xmath10 ) , gcs with _ strictly red _ hbs ( @xmath11 @xmath12 0.9 ) , and gcs with intermediate hb morphologies ( @xmath13 + 0.4 ) .",
    "values of @xmath11 were taken from borkova & marsakov ( 2000 ) . in all the figures , a few landmark clusters are highlighted with special symbols ( see caption of figure [ fig1 ] ) . those are 47 tuc , a metal - rich gc with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.8 and a red hb ;",
    "m67 , a @xmath14 gyr old , solar metallicity , open cluster ( data from schiavon , caldwell & rose 2004 ) ; ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , the highest metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.6 ) galactic gcs known to host bhb stars ( rich et al .",
    "1997 ) , and ngc  5904 , a metal poor gc with [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.27 ( kraft & ivans 2003 ) and whose hb has a sizeable blue extension ( piotto et al .",
    "our sub - sample spans a wide range in metallicity and hb morphology ; most notably , gcs with 1.5 @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath15 0.9 are strongly affected by hb morphology , in the sense that @xmath0  in strictly blue - hb gcs is stronger by @xmath41 @xmath3 than in those with strictly red hbs at the same [ fe / h ] .",
    "in figure [ fig2 ] we contrast the data with our model predictions for fe4383 and balmer lines in single sps .",
    "the balmer indices were chosen to provide a large baseline and because model predictions were available for them at the time of this analysis .",
    "the models used are those by schiavon ( 2004 , in preparation , but see schiavon et al .",
    "2004 ) . for our present purposes ,",
    "derivation of absolute ages and [ fe / h]s is not essential , and we focus our discussion on relative spectroscopic ages .    the main issue we address in this _",
    "letter _ is evident in figure [ fig2 ] : gcs with mostly blue hbs ( asterisks ) have stronger balmer lines and thus appear younger than gcs with red hbs ( open circles ) even though they are all equally old ( e.g. rosenberg et al .  2002 ) .",
    "this effect has been pointed out by many ( e.g. freitas pacheco & barbuy 1995 ; lee et al .",
    "2000 ; beasley et al . 2002 ; maraston et al .",
    "2003 ) and results from the fact that our sps models do not account for bhb stars , which have strong balmer lines and mimick a younger age .",
    "this is a source of confusion for cluster age estimation based on the ews of balmer lines .",
    "furthermore , while the ages of gcs with red hbs do not vary according to different balmer lines , the same is not true for gcs with blue hbs : their mean ages are @xmath43.5 and @xmath46 gyr as given by @xmath0and @xmath1 , respectively",
    ". the same effect is also observed in the data for ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( open triangles ) , whose inferred ages are @xmath48 or @xmath411 gyr according to @xmath0  or @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for m67 , which is a cluster of truly intermediate age ( @xmath43.5 gyr ; schiavon et al .",
    "2004 ) and whose spectrum is free from the influence of bhb stars , the inferred age is independent of the age indicator .",
    "we believe that these effects are caused by the increasing contribution of bhb stars to the integrated gc light at bluer wavelengths , such that @xmath0  is more affected than @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the gc spectroscopic ages look younger according to @xmath0  than @xmath1 .    to verify this hypothesis we computed integrated indices for ngc  5904 directly from its cmd in two different ways : first by taking all the stars into account , and then removing all the bhb stars in order to assess their effect on absorption line ews .",
    "this is the most straightforward and model independent way of assessing the contribution of bhb stars to the integrated gc light .",
    "we chose ngc  5904 because its hb is mostly blue and its cmd is indicative of an old age .",
    "the colors and magnitudes of ngc  5904 stars were transformed into @xmath16 and @xmath17 using the calibrations described in schiavon et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and assuming [ fe / h ] = 1.27 ( kraft & ivans 2003 ) .",
    "the resulting stellar parameters were used as input to our fitting functions in order to predict line indices for each star in the cluster cmd .",
    "the latter are integrated throughout the cmd , with weights based on the photometry and stellar counts .",
    "the bv photometry , its completeness as a function of v magnitude , the distance modulus [ @xmath18 , and the reddening towards ngc  5904 [ @xmath19 were taken from piotto et al .",
    "the result is displayed by arrows in figure [ fig2 ] that indicate how index values change when bhb stars are artificially removed from the cmd .",
    "the position of the cluster in both plots is shifted towards an old age ( @xmath41114 gyr ) , which corroborates our working hypothesis .",
    "furthermore the above correction does not alter the agreement of our model predictions with [ fe / h ] determinations from spectroscopic analysis of individual stars from ngc  5904 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 1.3 ; kraft & ivans 2003 ) .    in summary , we suggest that the different spectroscopic ages inferred from @xmath1 and @xmath0 are due to the stronger impact of bhb stars on the latter .",
    "below , we use this observation to disentangle the degeneracy between the effects of hb morphology and age on balmer lines measured in the integrated spectra of gcs .",
    "we have identified a distinctive signature of bhb stars in the integrated spectra of galactic gcs .",
    "the obvious implication is that we can devise an indicator that identifies their presence in a given gc , solely on the basis of absorption line ews .",
    "such an indicator would be most useful for work on distant gcs , for which cmds can not be obtained , by providing the means to distinguish truly intermediate - age gcs from old gcs with bhb stars .",
    "the best indicator we found is the ratio between @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] displays the main result of this _ letter _ , where we plot the data in the @xmath20 vs. fe4383 plane , overlaid with our models .",
    "it can be seen that gcs with mostly blue hbs are displaced far above the locus occupied by the models , indicating ages substantially younger than @xmath42 gyr , in stark constrast with the ages inferred in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in fact @xmath20 is more sensitive to hb morphology than age , given that the separation in @xmath20 between gcs with red and blue hbs is about twice that between models for 2 and 14 gyr single sps .",
    "gcs with strictly red hbs , such as 47 tuc , are consistent with the ages and metallicities inferred from figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "as expected , gcs with mostly red or intermediate hbs lie somewhere in between the loci occupied by gcs with extreme hb morphologies .",
    "note that the data for m67 , which has a truly intermediate age , are ( as in figure [ fig2 ] ) consistent with its known age and [ fe / h ] . we conclude that the ratio @xmath20 discriminates between younger clusters and those whose balmer lines are strengthened by the presence of bhb stars .",
    "the high s / n of our spectra make it relatively easy to detect the influence of the bhb population on the @xmath20 index . for instance",
    ", for ngc  5904 which has @xmath21 ( 1 @xmath22 ) , the value expected to be consistent with the age estimated from @xmath1  from figure [ fig2 ] ( @xmath4 6 gyr ) would be @xmath23 , or @xmath44 @xmath22 lower than the measured value .",
    "a useful quantity for observers is the minimum s / n needed to distinguish between a gc with bhb stars and a young gc .",
    "this was estimated by computing index errors as a function s / n , assuming pure poisson noise . in the case",
    "above , one needs @xmath20 measured to better than 0.2 which , for a 2-@xmath22 detection requires a s / n of roughly 3040 per @xmath3 at @xmath24 4100 @xmath3 , a value that can be achieved with reasonable integrations of extragalactic gcs with 8 - 10 m class telescopes ( e.g. cohen et al .",
    "2003 ; larsen et al .  2003",
    "; hempel et al .  2003 ) .",
    "in this _ letter _ we propose a method to detect the signature of bhb stars in the integrated spectra of gcs .",
    "if @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and an fe line are measured accurately , one can infer the presence of bhb stars in a given gc if the age indicated by @xmath20 is substantially younger than that indicated by @xmath1 . for intermediate - age clusters ,",
    "the ages indicated by the different indices are the same within the uncertainties . for this method to work , _",
    "sp synthesis models employed must predict correct ages and metal abundances for systems with truly intermediate / young ages_. we showed that our models predict the correct age and [ fe / h ] for m67 .",
    "while the case for applying this method to disentangle age from hb morphology seems strong for single - age systems , _ it is not clear that it should succeed when applied to galaxies _ , where multiple turnoffs due to a complex star formation history can not in principle be distinguished from the combination of an old turnoff with other kinds of warm stars like bhb stars .",
    "we thank francesca de angeli and manuela zoccali for providing us with data on the completeness of the photometry for ngc  5904 .",
