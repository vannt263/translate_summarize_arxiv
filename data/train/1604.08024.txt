    "ultra - diffuse galaxies ( udgs - a termed coined by van dokkum et al .",
    "2015 ) constitute a likely heterogeneous population of low - surface brightness systems ( e.g. impey et al .",
    "1988 ; bothun et al . 1991 ; dalcanton et al . 1997 ; van dokkum et al . 2015 ; koda et al . 2015 ; mihos et al . 2015 ; muoz et al . 2015 ; van der burg et al .",

    "their most outstanding characteristic is that while their stellar masses are of order @xmath7   or less , their effective radii are comparable to l@xmath8 galaxies ( 2 - 5 kpc ) . for this reason ,",
    "the origin of the udgs remains controversial .",
    "one possibility discussed by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2015 ) is that udgs are failed l@xmath8 galaxies whose early accretion to the cluster environment ( z@xmath92 ) quenched their growth .",
    "others , however , have suggested that udgs are the high - spin tail of normal dwarf galaxies ( amorisco & loeb 2016 ) .",
    "the two competing scenarios can be confronted with the observations using different approaches .",
    "a strong test is to measure the virial mass of udgs and explore whether they inhabit dark matter ( dm ) haloes of dwarf - mass ( @xmath10 ) or milky way ( mw)-mass haloes ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "udgs are generally too faint to measure dynamical masses directly through stellar velocity dispersions and rotation curves .",
    "beasley et al . (",
    "2016 ) have shown that the dynamics of the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of udgs in the virgo cluster can be used to measure dynamical masses .",
    "these authors determined a total virial mass of @xmath12  for the udg vcc  1287 , in agreement with the hypothesis that udgs are dwarf - like systems .",
    "an alternative , followed by romn & trujillo ( 2016 ) , is to explore the spatial distribution of udgs versus dwarfs and l@xmath8 galaxies in clusters and outside these structures .",
    "these authors also find that the spatial distribution of udgs are more similar to dwarfs than to l@xmath8 galaxies .    in this contribution",
    "we determine the total number of gcs in a large udg ( df17 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2015 ) in the coma cluster based on archival _",
    "hubble space telescope _ imaging .",
    "this galaxy has a size ( effective radius 3.4 kpc ) large enough to be considered as a good candidate for a failed mw galaxy at high redshift , and is the fourth most luminous udg in the van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2015 ) catalog .",
    "if this udg were an early quenched l@xmath8 galaxy , a natural expectation would be that the number of gcs in df17 , and the gc mean colors , will be similar to the in - situ gcs of the mw . as we will show in this work , the total number of gcs in df17 , and the mean gc colors ,",
    "imply that they are hosted by a dwarf rather than a giant galaxy .    during the refereeing process of this paper , peng & lim ( 2016 )",
    "published a study based on the same dataset analysed here .",
    "these authors obtain very similar results for the total number of gcs in df17 ( @xmath13 gcs ) , but focus on slightly different aspects of the gc system , namely the gc luminosity function and density profile rather than color distributions .",
    "van dokkum et al . ( 2015 ) identified a sample of 47 udgs projected against the coma cluster with the dragonfly telephoto array ( abraham & van dokkum 2015 ) .",
    "one of these udgs , df17 , van dokkum et al .",
    "re - identified in archival _",
    "hst / acs _ imaging .",
    "we retrieved these data in order to analyse the gc population of this system .",
    "these data comprise of deep imaging in the f475w ( ) , f606w ( ) and f814w ( ) filters ( go-12476 ; pi : cook ; macri et al .",
    "exposure times totalled 5100s , 5820s and 5100s in each filter , respectively .",
    "these data were retrieved from the archive on 18 march 2016 and after pipeline reduction , individual exposures were median combined with swarp ( bertin et al . 2002 ) in order to place them on a common grid and remove a significant cosmic ray contribution . the combined 3-band color image zooming in the the region around df17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the imaging data using sextractor ( bertin 1996 ) with a 5-pixel radial aperture . in order to maximize our object detection",
    ", we set both the detection and analysis thresholds to 0.9@xmath0 of the background level , and detected objects on 7-pixel unsharp masked images in the f814w filter .",
    "we required that objects were detected within all three filters to be considered a real source .",
    "we performed photometry on the original images .",
    "magnitude zeropoints were obtained from the acs webpages corresponding to the dates of the observations , and are zp(f475w ) = 26.06 , zp(f606w ) = 26.49 and zp(f814w ) = 25.94 .",
    "ab magnitudes were then obtained by correcting to infinite aperture using the enclosed energy curves of sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . for the above radial aperture , we determine that the _ hst / acs _ imaging is 5@xmath0 complete down to f475w = 27.20 , f606w = 27.33 and f814w = 26.98 .    at the distance of the coma cluster ( @xmath14=35.0 ; carter et al .",
    "2008 ) , gcs are unresolved and appear as point - sources .",
    "however , the majority of background galaxies are resolved allowing for their effective removal .",
    "we selected point sources by running our photometry with two aperture sizes , one of 5 pixel radius and another of 10 pixels similar to the approach of peng et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "our point source selection window is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the locus of point sources lies at 0.25 , and we selected objects @xmath15 mag about this locus .",
    "in addition , we imposed a faint magnitude limit at = 26.98 , which corresponds to our 5@xmath0 completeness limit , and a bright limit at = 22.0 , which corresponds to @xmath16 at our adopted coma distance , and would include all known mw gcs .",
    "objects brighter than = 22.0 are assumed to be stars .    to narrow our selection",
    "further we applied a color cut @xmath17()@xmath18 which is consistent with the expected color ranges for old gcs ( e.g. , beasley et al . 2016 ; peng et al .",
    "2011 ) . from our selection criteria ,",
    "we detect 68 gc candidates .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram of point sources is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "inspection of these sources across the field showed a fairly uniform distribution , with a clustering of candidates around df17 . to select potential gc candidates associated with df17",
    ", we placed a 300-pixel radius aperture about the center of df17 ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and selected all sources within this radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "a 300 pixel radius corresponds to 15@xmath21 , or @xmath22 times the effective radius of df17 ( 7@xmath21 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "this radius is smaller than the extent of the gc system of the virgo udg vcc  1287 ( beasley et al .",

    "there are 11 candidates within this radius and their locations are shown in figs .",

    ", this corresponds to @xmath23 , or @xmath24 by comparing the acs   and johnson @xmath2 filter responses using an old , metal - poor stellar population model ( vazdekis et al . 2010 ) and using the reddening corrections of schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) .    to determine the total gc population in df17",
    ", it is necessary to correct for the contribution from background sources ( intracluster gcs and interlopers ) and the limited depth of the _ hst / acs _ imaging .",
    "we determine the background contribution by randomly placing 1,000 300 pixel radius apertures across the field and counting the number of gc candidates within the aperture .",
    "we masked out the region of df17 itself , and accounted for regions where the selection region fell outside the detector .",
    "since no other bright galaxies are present in the acs field , we masked out no other regions .",
    "we find a mean background of @xmath25 objects within the 300 pixel radius , or @xmath26 objects per arcmin@xmath27 .",
    "we determined the total number of gcs in df17 by assuming that the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) is described by a gaussian function .",
    "our photometry is 5 @xmath0 complete to = 26.98 , corresponding to @xmath28 for @xmath29 . by comparison , peng et al .",
    "( 2011 ) quote a turn - over in the gclf of @xmath30 for the virgo galaxy m87 .",
    "however , studies of cluster dwarfs suggest that the turn - over of the gclf in less massive systems tends to fainter magnitudes , with @xmath31 ( miller & lotz 2007 ; villegas et al . 2010 ; peng et al . 2011 ) .    in the case of an `` m87-like '' gclf , and by integrating a gaussian function",
    ", we would detect 54 percent of the gc population in df17 , implying a total of 19 gcs ( including the background correction ) . in the `` dwarf - like '' case",
    ", we would detect the brightest @xmath32 per cent of the gc population , since the gclf is both fainter and narrower in these systems , implying a total of 27 gcs .",
    "since our range of estimates is consistent with that expected for dwarfs , rather than giant galaxies ( e.g. , peng et al .",
    "2008 ) , we assume a dwarf - like gclf and adopt the latter estimate for the total gc population of df17 , i.e. , @xmath33 gcs . uncertainties come from the quadrature sum of the poisson and background uncertainties , including a @xmath34 mpc ( @xmath35 mag ) uncertainty in the location of the peak of the gclf . from this",
    "we calculate a @xmath2-band specific frequency , @xmath3 .",

    "2016 ) and for local galaxies from the catalog of harris et al .",
    "stellar masses are calculated from the @xmath37band luminosities of the systems and stellar mass - to - light ratios from zibetti et al .",
    "the lower - limit errorbars for df17 and vcc  1287 indicate the position of the number of detected gcs prior to correction for incomplete sampling of the gclf . for df17 we calculate a stellar mass , @xmath36=@xmath38 , based on the relation of taylor et al .",

    "( 2010 ) models .",
    "the locations of the two udgs indicate that they have significantly poorer gc systems than the present - day mw ( @xmath41 ; @xmath42  ) .",
    "also , the udgs have significantly lower stellar mass than the lmc , but have comparable gc populations ( lmc ; @xmath43 ; mackey & gilmore 2004 ) .",
    "this is significant because one hypothesis put forward by van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2015 ) as the origin of coma udgs is that they may be quenched @xmath44 systems .",
    "gcs are generally thought to have formed a high redshifts , as suggested by the ages of mw gcs ( @xmath45 gyr , or @xmath46 ; e.g. , vandenbergh et al .",
    "2013 ) and the old ages of extragalactic gc systems ( puzia et al . 2005 ; strader et al .",
    "presumably any quenching of star formation in udgs took place _",
    "after _ the bulk of the gcs formed , thereby making the absolute number of gcs an indicator of the nature of udgs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we plot the expected location of the mw at @xmath47 , assuming a stellar mass evolution from snaith et al .",

    "we assume that the _ in situ _ population of mw gcs formed at high redshift constitutes @xmath49 per cent of the present - day gc population , with the remaining @xmath50 per cent later accreted ( forbes & bridges 2010 ) .",
    "the direction of evolution of the mw is indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we find that , assuming a milky - way like star formation history , quenching occurring at @xmath47 does not reproduce the stellar mass or , perhaps more importantly , the total gc population observed in df17 ( or vcc 1287 ) . even assuming quenching at @xmath51 ( a factor of @xmath52 change in stellar mass )",
    "does not place the mw near the stellar mass of df17 .    performing a similar exercise with the lmc",
    "is illustrative . assuming quenching at @xmath47 implies a mass evolution of a factor of @xmath53 to the present day ( leaman et al . 2016 ; in preparation ) , placing the lmc ( and its gc system ) at a stellar mass similar to df17 .",
    "further , we also obtain an estimate of the virial mass of df17 by using @xmath54 as a proxy for total halo mass ( beasley et al .",
    "2016 ; harris et al 2013 ) . for @xmath55 gcs , we obtain @xmath56  , using the relation of harris et al .",
    "the uncertainty on this mass estimate comes purely from the uncertainty in @xmath54 , the scatter in mass in the @xmath57 relation is at least a factor of two in the dwarf galaxy regime ( harris et al .",

    "this virial mass is very similar to that of vcc",

    "interestingly , it is also similar to mass estimates for the lmc ( @xmath61 ; gmez et al .",

    "2010 ) .    therefore",
    ", both the total numbers and colors of the gcs in df17 suggest that they are hosted in a halo more massive than otherwise suggested by the stellar mass of df17 .",
    "furthermore , the inferred total mass of the system is characteristic of massive dwarf systems such as the lmc , rather than the mw .",
    "at least three independent observational tests ( beasley et al . 2016 , romn & trujillo 2016 and the one presented here ) support the idea that udgs are not failed mw galaxies but instead dwarf galaxies .",
    "however , while the stellar masses of udgs are close to 10@xmath76 , many of their properties are like those of galaxies a factor of 10 more massive in stellar mass .",
    "for instance , the total number of gcs in df17 ( and in vcc  1287 ) is similar to that found in the lmc .",
    "also , the inferred virial masses of df17 and vcc  1287 ( @xmath77 ) locate these objects closer to the expectations of a galaxy such as the lmc rather than the mw .",
    "moreover , the sizes of udgs ( 1.5@xmath78r@xmath79@xmath785 kpc ) are not actually uncommon among 10@xmath80  dwarfs ( e.g. amorisco & loeb 2016 ; romn & trujillo 2016 ; shen et al . 2003 ) .",
    "all these studies support the idea that udgs are dwarf - like systems , and relatively massive dwarfs ( in terms of virial mass ) - again , perhaps similar to the lmc .",
    "however , what does seem to make udgs unusual is their low stellar masses when compared to their inferred virial masses ( e.g. , as shown here and in beasley et al . 2016 ) .",
    "low stellar masses , but relatively rich gc systems suggests that udgs _ are _ quenched systems , but whose quenching occured _ after _ the bulk of gc formation occurred .",
    "based on the old ages of mw gcs , and present - day stellar masses of udgs , this possibly places their quenching somewhere in the region of @xmath47 ( c.f . ,",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "this quenching redshift is consistent with those seen in simulations ( yozin & bekki 2015 ) .",
    "we view as unlikely the possibility that the low stellar masses but rich gc systems of these systems is a result of stripping due to the tidal field of the coma cluster , since simulations suggest that gcs are expected to be lost preferentially over the stars in these systems ( smith et al .",
    "2013 , 2015 ) .",
    "if udgs are quenched lmc - type galaxies , we should expect that that udg colors would be compatible with the old stellar populations in the lmc .",
    "measuring ages from broad - band colors is fraught with uncertainty , but the global colors measured for df17 ( =0.84 ) are consistent with larger samples ( romn & trujillo 2016 ) , and with a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath81 at old ages ( using the vazdekis 2010,2015 models ) .",
    "this metallicity is in agreement with the old ( @xmath82 gyr ; @xmath83 ) stars in the disk of the lmc ( carrera et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that udgs constitute a class of quenched dwarfs - perhaps quenched lmc - like galaxies , whose quenching took place at @xmath84 . further mass measurements of udgs are important , since it is not presently clear whether the dm fraction of udgs ( beasley et al . 2016 ) are compatible with both proposed models for their formation ( e.g. , amorisco & loeb 2016 ) and also the predicted scatter in simulations ( e.g. , garrison - kimmel et al . 2016 ) .",
    "in addition , detailed stellar population analyses will help elucidate the precise time and mechanism of quenching in these systems .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of archival _ hst / acs _ imaging in the f475w ( ) , f606w ( ) and f814w ( ) bands of the globular cluster ( gc ) system of a large ( 3.4 kpc effective radius ) ultra - diffuse galaxy ( df17 ) believed located in the coma cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 11 gcs down to the 5@xmath0 completeness limit of the imaging ( = 27 mag ) . </S>",
    "<S> correcting for background and our detection limits yields a total population of gcs in this galaxy of @xmath1 and a @xmath2-band specific frequency , @xmath3 . based on comparisons to the gc systems of local galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> we show that both the absolute number and the colors of the gc system of df17 are consistent with the gc system of a dark - matter dominated dwarf galaxy with virial mass @xmath4   and a dark - to - stellar mass ratio , @xmath5 . based on the stellar mass - growth of the milky way </S>",
    "<S> , we show that df17 can not be understood as a failed milky way - like system , but is more similar to quenched large magellanic cloud - like systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mean color of gc population , = @xmath6 mag , coincides with the peak of the color distribution of intracluster gcs and are also similar to those of the blue gcs in the outer regions of massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that both the intracluster gc population in coma and the blue - peak in the gc populations of massive galaxies may be fed - at least in part - by the disrupted equivalents of systems such as df17 . </S>"
