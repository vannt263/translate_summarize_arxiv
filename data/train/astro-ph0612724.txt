    "this is similar to the tidal tail super massive clusters in tadpole , in which the significant blue excess is considered to be related to recent star formation ( jarrett et al .",

    "2006 ) .      the brightest infrared knot in arp  24 ( k0 ) was found to be associated with a complex of five star clusters ( yscc for short ) , based on u and i - band wfpc2 images from _ hst _ ( fig .",

    "we found the regions in arp  24 followed a similar scaling relation between mass@xmath62 and logl(3.6@xmath5 m ) to that in the arp  82 system ( hancock et al .",
    "the specific star formation rate ( ssfr , sfr per unit stellar mass , in units of gyr@xmath15 ) for each region are 0.32 , 0.08 , 0.14 , 0.13 gyr@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the ssfrs of these regions in arp  24 are higher than that of most of the local star - forming galaxies ( with values between 0.03 and 0.2 gyr@xmath15 ; bell et al . 2005 ) , but are much lower than that of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) in the local universe ( lie between 1.2 and 10 gyr@xmath15 ; wang et al .",
    "however , the ssfrs estimated here will only be a lower limit for the ssfrs within or around the yscs in themselves , due to the contamination of star lights ( dominated by old population ) from their parent galaxy .",
    "peculiar one - time events and special places that have extraordinary high energy inputs was suggested by elmegreen ( 2004 ) as one of the possible mechanisms for triggering the formation of yscs .",
    "he suggested that yscs in galaxies undergoing interactions may formed by large part or local shock compressions and collapse from cloud impacts or colliding supershells .",
    "bastian et al .",
    "( 2006a ) studied the young star cluster complexes in antennae and suggested that if we assume that the grouping of complexes formed out of the same gmc , then the star formation is triggered by an external perturbation .",

    "( 2005 ) studied the infrared properties of the supergiant shell region of the dwarf galaxy ic  2574 using _",
    "spitzer _ and demonstrate that the expanding shell is affecting its surroundings by triggering star formation and heating the dust .",
    "the morphology of arp  24 indicates that it may formed in a minor merger scenario ( interaction between a gas - rich late - type spiral and a small companion ) or from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks ( bournaud et al .",
    "shaping / reshaping of galaxies is the biggest effect generally attribute to mergers ( cox 2004 ) .",
    "the tidal stripping of a satellite can produce features such as long tails , and the accretion introduces new stellar populations into the galactic disk ( walker et al .",
    "1996 ) , i.e. , promotes a high sfr ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994,1996 ; see also cox 2004 ) in arp  24 .",
    "the yscs may form as a consequence of the high sfr per unit area in the galaxy ( larsen & richtler 2000 ) .",
    "arp  24 shows a strong asymmetry in g - i colors ( see fig .",
    "8) through the galactic disk , the regions near the yscc are relatively bluer than that near the nucleus",
    ". this asymmetry may be due to the differences in star formation , stellar populations , gas / dust contents of different regions caused by galaxy interactions .",
    "furthermore , the one - armed appearance and the broad fan - like structure seen in the primary disk of arp  24 indicate that this galaxy may have formed by a retrograde fly - by encounter ( see , e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1996 ; struck & smith 2003 ; and a review by struck 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the companion galaxy in the east seems nearly edge - on ( also a bit warp ) , with a weak bridge connects to the primary disk and faint knots near the outer edges of its disk ( see figs .",
    "this could indicates the existence of an edge - on ring ( or other waves ) , which would be consistent with a small angle between the orbital plane of the companion and the disk plane of the primary , if the closest approach was on the west side .",
    "it is also possible that the primary disk might have rotated by about half a turn in the time since the closest approach .",
    "thus , the region of the yscc in arp  24 might be in the part of the disk that was closest to the companion and most perturbed at that time .",
    "if we adopt a rotation velocity of about 100 km s@xmath15 ( derived from the rotation curve of m  51 @xmath63 ) and the distance between yscc and the nuclear star cluster ( @xmath1 2.7kpc ) as the radius of rotation , then such half a turn will takes about 8@xmath1010@xmath32yrs ; and moreover , if we assume a circular orbit of the encounter and a relative velocity of @xmath1 400 km s@xmath15 between the companion and the primary s core ( eneev et al .",
    "1973 ) , then the time since the closest approach in the west is roughly about 10@xmath30yrs , consistent with the rotational time estimated above .",
    "this time scale may linked to the processes of yscc formation ( e.g. , modes and mechanisms of the induced star formation ; feedbacks include radiation / thermal pressures , stellar winds and supernova blasts , etc ) .",
    "the existence of a large amount of young ( a - type ) stars in the nucleus of arp  24 ( see @xmath133.3 ) may also be related to the age of interaction in this system .",
    "however , such a formation scenario still remains speculative , and needs to be confirmed by hydrodynamical modeling ( e.g. , struck et al .",
    "2005 ) and numerical simulations of star formation in galaxy mergers ( e.g. , struck & smith 2003 ; cox 2004 ) .",
    "recent studies have shown that young star clusters tend to form in large complexes instead of isolation ( bastian et al .",
    "according to efremov ( 2004 ) , these complexes ( or so called clusters of clusters ) are often the massive bound clusters formed from a single gas supercloud , and within high pressure surroundings .",

    "wilson et al . ( 2003 ) studied properties of the supergiant molecular complexes in the antennae using co emission , and suggested that young massive star clusters formed from dense cores within the observed supergiant molecular complexes .",
    "the star clusters in the yscc of arp  24 may formed in a single gmc simultaneously , since they have similar ages and masses , and reside in a small region of @xmath1127pc ( see @xmath133.2 ) .",
    "then they may disperse quickly and dissipate to become field population before reaching ages of 100myr according to wilson et al .",
    "however , this scenario still needs to be confirmed by deep spectroscopic observations with high dispersion and high spatial resolution , for measuring the velocity dispersions and obtaining chemical abundances of individual clusters in the yscc ( see , e.g. , larsen et al .",

    "the high f@xmath54/f@xmath70 ratio in the yscc may be due to the weakness or lack of the pah emission bands , which are caused by low pah abundance as consequences of pah destructions by strong uv radiation field and/or other mechanisms ( e.g. , shocks ) within this region ; or pah - dust competition , i.e. , pah molecules ca nt be excited by uv photons due to the presence of the dust grains ( martin - hernandez et al .",

    "<S> , we found that the brightest infrared knot in arp  24 is associated with a complex of five young massive star clusters , within a region of @xmath1 0.95@xmath2 radius ( 127pc ) in size . </S>",

    "<S> the star clusters in this complex are very young ( within ages of @xmath1 3 - 5 myr ) and massive ( masses of @xmath110@xmath3m@xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization parameter and metallicity of the complex were estimated using the emission line ratios , and the star formation rates were calculated using monochromatic 24@xmath5 m , fuv , and h@xmath0 line luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that arp  24 may formed by a retrograde fly - by encounter indicated by its one - armed appearance and fan - like structure , and the formation of the yscs in this galaxy is triggered by the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters in the ysc complex may formed in a single giant molecular cloud simultaneously . from the ultraviolet to mid - infrared spectral energy distributions , we found that the region of the ysc complex is relatively bluer in optical and has higher 24@xmath5 m dust emission relative to the starlight and 8@xmath5 m emission . </S>",
    "<S> this warm infrared color may due to strong uv radiation field or other mechanisms ( e.g. , shocks ) within this region which may destroy the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and enhance the small grain emission at 24@xmath5 m . </S>"
