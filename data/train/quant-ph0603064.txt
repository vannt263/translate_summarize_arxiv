    "recently , the non - classical nature of light has attracted much attention because of its possible application to novel optical technologies , including quantum information processing @xcite and quantum imaging @xcite .",
    "actually , over the past few decades , a considerable number of studies have been conducted on non - classical light , which can not be explained by classical wave optics . in such studies , photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down - conversion have frequently been used because they can be easily generated and can provide a superior environment to realize the concept of the non - classical nature of light . with the development of studies on entangled photons , it has become clear that entanglement , or quantum correlation , between the constituent photons plays a crucial role in the formation of diffraction patterns .",
    "klysyko and his co - workers have carried out pioneering theoretical work in this field @xcite .",
    "based on this proposal , strekalov and his co - workers have reported non - classical effects in diffraction phenomena , known as `` ghost - interference '' @xcite .",
    "this work has been developed into one of the fields of quantum imaging .",
    "meanwhile , the concept of the `` photonic de broglie wave '' has been proposed as an intuitive and essential way to understand the interferometric properties of a multiphoton state @xcite . within this concept ,",
    "the photonic de broglie wavelength of an ensemble photons with wavelength @xmath0 and number of photons @xmath1 can be measured to be @xmath2 . recently ,",
    "a number of experimental demonstrations of this phenomenon have been realized @xcite .",
    "this reduced interferometric property of a multiphoton state has attracted great interest as a light source for novel imaging technology , achieving high - resolution imaging at sub - wavelength resolution .",
    "this proposal is known as `` quantum lithography '' @xcite .",
    "dangelo and her co - workers have shown , as a proof - of - principle experiment of quantum lithography , that the width of the two - photon diffraction patterns is narrower than that of classical light by a factor of 2 @xcite . for its simplicity ,",
    "young s double slits have been frequently used in these experiments , and the expected counting rate was obtained by calculating a quantum - mechanical fourth - order correlation function .",
    "the use of young s double slit constitutes a simple and thoughtful approach , but the method of directly calculating the fourth - order correlation function is relatively complicated for analyzing arbitrary patterns of two - photon diffraction . in this paper",
    ", we present a simple method using fourier - optical analysis for a two - photon state , considering the quantum correlation between the constituent photons .",
    "this approach corresponds to the fraunhofer diffraction of the classical optics , and is applicable to any arbitrary object . to demonstrate the essence of this concept , we measure the diffraction - interference patterns of parametric down - converted photons through a transmission grating , as an example of arbitrary objects , by means of both one- and two - photon detection schemes . we show that the observed patterns can be quantitatively explained by fourier - optical analysis",
    "in the process of parametric down - conversion , the properties ( energy , momentum , and their uncertainty ) of signal and idler photons are determined by the phase matching condition in a nonlinear crystal , concerning the length and dispersion of the crystal @xcite and the divergence of pump beam @xcite . in the following ,",

    "in the same manner , the two - photon counting rate at the far field can be written as a function of the transverse wave number @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the creation and annihilation operator of the photon with the transverse wave number @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "here we discuss only the experiments using a classically momentum - correlated beam in terms of our fourier - optical analysis because a discussion taking into account a statistical average is required for incoherent illumination , such as in the experiment using thermal light .",
    "the most significant feature of the experiment using momentum - correlated beams is that the diffraction pattern of classically momentum - correlated beams , produced by rotating a mirror before the beam splitter as shown in figure  [ fig : ghostset](a ) , appears as a function of @xmath78 , whereas there is no spatial entanglement on the object , that is , @xmath26 .",

    "however , by rotating the mirror , the diffraction pattern shown in figure  [ fig : ghost](a ) oscillates in a direction parallel to the line satisfying @xmath33 with the scanning frequency of the mirror . therefore , taking an average of the product of the two signals over a sufficiently long period compared to the scanning period of the mirror , we can obtain the two - photon counting rate as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 represents the displacement of the pattern by the rotation of the mirror , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the one - photon counting rate from each object having the form of @xmath9 and @xmath96 , respectively . since",

    "thus , the cross - sectional plots along @xmath87 seen in figures  [ fig : ghost](b ) and ( c ) give the same pattern , as shown in figure  [ fig : ghost](d ) . therefore , to identify the difference between the pattern produced by quantum correlated photons and that by classically correlated beams in the case of ghost interference experiments , more detailed discussion is required as reported in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand",

    "figure  [ fig : classical](a ) shows the expected density plot , which corresponds to the pattern shown in figure  [ fig : plotg1](a ) , a pattern that oscillates in a direction parallel to the line satisfying @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the upper and lower graphs in figure  [ fig : classical](b ) represent their cross - sectional plots along @xmath33 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "interference peaks appear with half a modulation period of the normal diffraction - interference pattern shown in figure  [ fig : plotg1 ] in the case of @xmath33 , while it shows no modulations in the case of @xmath33 .",
    "to clarify the image formation process , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq_a1 ] ) as follows : @xmath102 where @xmath103 if we detected at the same point , i.e. , @xmath33 , the two - photon counting rate @xmath104 becomes constant as a result of @xmath105 . on the other hand , in the case of detection at the symmetrical position @xmath91 , eq .",
    "( [ eq_a3 ] ) becomes @xmath106 this equation means that the interference of the two photons has half a modulation period of the one - photon counting rate @xmath107 .",
    "however , the two - photon counting rate @xmath13 is nothing more than the autocorrelation function of the one - photon counting rate @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the diffraction width of this pattern is no narrower than that of the normal patterns as shown in figure  [ fig : plotg1](b ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the consideration that spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit can be achieved only by using spatially entangled photons but can not be achieved using a classical light source , as discussed in ref .",
    "the experiment described in this paper focuses on the use of entangled photons for novel quantum imaging technologies , which has been attracting much attention in connection with the concept of the photonic de broglie wave .",
    "we have investigated the role of spatial correlation in diffraction - interference phenomena by measuring the spatial diffraction - interference patterns of spontaneous parametric down - converted biphotons through a transmission grating .",
    "we have shown that the spatially correlated biphoton exhibits half the modulation period of that of classical light . also , we have confirmed that the one - photon interference of the biphoton exhibits no modulation .",
    "furthermore , by controlling the spatial correlation between the two photons , we have successfully demonstrated that the diffraction - interference pattern changes from the perfectly correlated biphoton case to the classical case . in order to understand these experimental results in a quantitative and straightforward manner",
    ", we developed the fourier - optical analysis of a two - photon state taking into account the spatial correlation between the two photons .    in our experiment , we have investigated the diffraction - interference patterns formed by a one - dimensional regular grating , and demonstrated the validity of fourier - optical analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that this analysis is extendable to arbitrary one- and two - dimensional objects , and can thus be is very useful for future imaging technologies utilizing entangled photons .",
    "we are grateful to h. ishihara for his valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the program `` strategic information and communications r & d promotion scheme '' of the ministry of internal affairs and communications of japan .                                              from the fitting we found that the ratio of the slit period to the slit width ( _ d / s _ ) is 3.3@xmath1083.8 , whereas it should be 2 for the actual grating we used .",
    "this discrepancy is not due to the quantum mechanical effect because the same tendency was observed for both biphotons and classical lights .",
    "although the reason for the discrepancy is not clear at present , it might be due to the longitudinal groove pattern of the grating that was printed on a glass plate ."
