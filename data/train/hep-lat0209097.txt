    "experimental evidence suggests the existence of particles with `` exotic '' quantum numbers @xmath1 , such as the @xmath2 @xcite and the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "explanations of these include four - quark states and hybrid mesons  mesons with gluonic excitations .",
    "several lattice studies @xcite have used quenched wilson and improved wilson fermions to explore the possibility of such hybrid states . using both quenched and dynamical kogut - susskind quarks , the milc collaboration has studied the @xmath0 hybrid closer to the physical quark mass limit .",
    "we can construct a @xmath0 hybrid meson operator as the cross product of a color octet rho meson and the chromomagnetic field : @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we have several choices of rho meson operators , but it is convenient to choose the k - s flavor singlet @xmath5 , with the spin @xmath6 flavor structure @xmath7 .",
    "this is because each spin component of the @xmath0 includes two terms , for example : @xmath8 if the flavor of the @xmath9 is dependent on its spin state , the resulting contribution is not a flavor eigenstate .",
    "in computing the field strength , we apply 32 ape smearing @xcite iterations to the spatial gauge field links .",
    "there is a subtlety in using the chromomagnetic field to generate the full @xmath0 hybrid source operator .",
    "we might first determine the magnetic field strength everywhere , then multiply at each site by the quark source vector , and finally symmetrically shift to get the appropriate antiquark source vector .",
    "alternately , we might first apply the symmetric shift to the quark source to form an antiquark source , then multiply by the value of the chromomagnetic field .",
    "these methods are equivalent to measuring the @xmath10-field at the site of the quark ( fig . [",
    "fields]a ) and antiquark ( fig .",
    "[ fields]b ) , respectively .",
    "because the quark and antiquark are spatially separated in the flavor singlet @xmath5 , neither of these represents an eigenstate of charge conjugation . to get an eigenstate of @xmath11",
    ", we use a symmetrized combination of these for the @xmath0 hybrid operator .",
    "we measured the connected correlator of the @xmath0 hybrid state on three sets of @xmath12 lattices generated with the `` @xmath13 '' action @xcite . to isolate the effects of dynamical quarks , we used matched quenched and full qcd lattices with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , for the quenched quarks , @xmath16 for lattices with three degenerate flavors of dynamical sea quarks at the strange quark mass ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 for lattices with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "these choices of @xmath21 give approximately the same lattice spacing ( @xmath22 fm ) in the three cases .",
    "the corresponding choices of quark mass allow simulation at roughly equivalent values of @xmath23 , the square of the ratio of the psuedoscalar to vector meson masses .",
    "we fit the measured correlators to the sum of oscillating and normal exponentials : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the hybrid meson mass of interest and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are masses of nonexotic parity partner states which have oscillating correlators in the kogut - susskind formulation .",
    "we performed both four and five parameter fits .",
    "for the four parameter fits , we fix @xmath28 . for the five parameter",
    "fits we fix @xmath27 to a pre - determined @xmath29 meson mass and fit for @xmath30 as well .",
    "we varied the range of the fit and tried to choose values for @xmath25 corresponding to high - confidence fits that were insensitive to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the limits of the fit range .    ' '' ''     + = 3.10 in    ' '' ''     +    in fig .",
    "[ all_results ] we summarize our results along with the results of previous wilson quark studies by the milc group @xcite and the ukqcd collaboration @xcite as well as recent results from the zhongshan university group @xcite using wilson quarks on an anisotropic lattice .",
    "we use the string tension @xmath33 to establish the lattice length scale and plot @xmath34 . for comparison , we include the @xmath0 experimental candidates @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the physical value of @xmath35 .",
    "we use @xmath36 @xcite for the vertical scale .    for the quenched lattices we were able to fit the data with reasonable confidence levels ( 25 - 50% ) for valence quark masses",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 . fig . [ stability ] shows an example of fits for the quenched lattices for @xmath39 .",
    "we performed a linear extrapolation of these results to the physical value of @xmath23 .",
    "[ all_results ] . )    for lattices with three degenerate sea quarks at @xmath40 , we were also able to extract a value for @xmath25 in reasonable agreement with the quenched result .",
    "the fits , however , exhibited slightly larger statistical errors , and a slight dependence on range .",
    "the lattices with @xmath19 proved more interesting . in the case of a valence quark mass equal to @xmath40 ( @xmath17 )",
    ", we use the masses of the @xmath41 pseudoscalar state and the vector @xmath42 state , measured on the same lattices , for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the fitted mass agrees with those of the quenched and three - flavor results within two standard deviations , but with larger systematic errors , estimated from the dependence on fit range .    in the case of the light valence quark ( @xmath20 )",
    ", we were unable to say much about the @xmath0 hybrid mass with any confidence .",
    "the fits were very range dependent , indicating the likely presence of four - quark states into which the hybrid can decay .",
    "interpretation of lattice results depends crucially on understanding the lattice length scale .",
    "we use the string tension @xmath33 as opposed to other static potential scales such as @xmath45 or @xmath46 for two reasons .",
    "first , hybrid mesons are extended objects that feel the linear part of the static quark potential , where @xmath33 is defined , more than the coulombic part , where @xmath45 is defined .",
    "second , using @xmath33 to define the lattice spacing brings quenched and dynamical quark data into closer agreement for both the hybrids and for low - lying non - exotic hadrons @xcite . note that if we use @xmath47 fm , our quenched data extrapolates to 2033(70 ) mev , whereas using @xmath48 mev we get 1854(65 ) mev , quoting statistical errors only .",
    "the @xmath19 data illustrates that dynamical quarks introduce new and significant processes that contribute to the @xmath0 propagator .",
    "mixing with four - quark states is one possibility .",
    "we now have ahead of us the task of understanding these contributions so that we can make useful predictions of the @xmath0 hybrid mass in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
