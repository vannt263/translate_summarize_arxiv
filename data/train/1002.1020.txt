    "among active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , blazars show intense and variable emission above 100  mev @xcite , with variability timescales as short as a few days , or a few weeks .",
    "blazars emit across several decades of energy , from the radio to the tev energy band , and their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) typically show two distinct humps .",
    "the first peak occurs in the ir / optical band in the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and in the low - energy peaked bl lacs ( lbls ) , and at uv / x - rays in the high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) .",
    "the second hump peaks at mev  gev and tev energies in fsrqs / lbls and in hbls , respectively . in the framework of leptonic models , the first peak is commonly interpreted as synchrotron radiation from high - energy electrons in a relativistic jet , while the second peak is interpreted as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of soft seed photons by the same relativistic electrons .",
    "a recent review of the blazar emission mechanisms and energetics is given in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the blazar sed can be explained in the framework of the hadronic models , where the relativistic protons in the jet are the primary accelerated particles , emitting radiation by means of photo - pair and photo - pion production ( see @xcite for a review on hadronic models ) . since the launch of , the fsrq ( pks  2251@xmath12158 ; @xmath13 ) became one of the most active sources in the sky .",
    "its very high flux ( well above @xmath14 for @xmath15  mev ) , its flux variability ( on a time scale of 1 or 2 days ) , and the fact that it was always detected during any pointing , made it earn the nickname of _ crazy diamond _ : is now playing the same role as 3c  279 had for .",
    "multiwavelength studies of variable blazars are crucial in order to understand the physical processes responsible for the emission along the whole spectrum .",
    "since the detection of the exceptional 2005 outburst ( see @xcite ) , several monitoring campaigns were carried out to follow the source multi frequency behavior @xcite . in mid july 2007 ,",
    "3c  454.3 underwent a new optical brightening , which triggered observations at all frequencies . performed a target of opportunity ( too ) re - pointing towards the source and detected it in a very high state (",

    "* hereafter paper  i ) , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) , and in @xcite , respectively .",
    "paper  i and paper  ii demonstrated that to fit the simultaneous broad - band seds from radio to data , inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of external photons from the broad line region ( blr ) off the relativistic electrons in the jet was required . in an earlier work based on the @xcite preliminary flux estimate of the july 2007 flare",
    ", @xcite made a comparison between the seds in 2000 ( egret data ) , 2005 ( optical and x - ray flare ) , and 2007 ( flare ) , discussing the role of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath16 ( associated with the emitting source compactness ) during the different epochs .",
    "moreover , the results of correlation analysis performed in paper  i was consistent with no time - lags between the and the optical flux variations . such a result was recently confirmed by @xcite who correlated optical , uv , x - ray and data . in a very recent paper ,",
    "@xcite show the results of the first three months of observations of , from 2008 july to october .",
    "they present for the first time the signature of a spectral break above a few gev , interpreted as a possible break in the energy distribution of the emitting particles .",
    "in this paper ( paper  iii ) we present both a re - analysis of the published data collected during the period july 2007 - december 2007 , and the results of multiwavelength campaigns on during a long - lasting activity period between 2008 may 10 and 2009 january 12 . in particular , we show the results of the campaigns which took place on may  june 2008 ( mj08 ) , july  august 2008 ( ja08 ) , and october 2008 - january 2009 ( oj09 ) .",

    "in contrast , the period `` fall 2007 '' offers a good opportunity to test the correlation , since the @xmath10-ray flux , and even more the optical flux , exhibited strong variability .",
    "moreover , the period of common monitoring lasted for more than a month .",
    "the corresponding dcf ( figure  [ 3c454:fig : dcf_go_mc ] ) shows a maximum @xmath126 for a null time lag .    however , the shape of the peak is asymmetric , and if we calculate the centroid @xcite , we find that the time lag is @xmath127days , i.e.  about 10 hours .",
    "this result is in agreement with what was found by @xcite when analyzing the december 2007 observations only , and implies that the @xmath10-ray flux variations are delayed by few hours with respect to the optical ones . in the period `` mid 2008 '' the main optical peak ( and also the minor one ) occurred when agile was not observing the source . finally , we computed the dcf corresponding to the `` fall 2008 '' period .",

    "nevertheless , a possible trend ( higher fractional variability amplitude at higher frequency ) is also present .",
    "this possible trend of the fractional rms variability amplitude with the logarithm of the frequency was observed in other sources too ( see e.g. pks  2155@xmath142304 , * ? ? ?",

    "figure  [ 3c454:fig : multi : lc ] clearly shows a strong enhancement of the radio core flux starting about on mjd  54500 .",
    "the highest flux density is on mjd  54742 at 15  ghz and on mjd  54719 at  43 ghz .",
    "this variability is not well correlated with the variability at higher frequencies : optical and data data show more different flares in the period mjd 5440054800 ( see figure  [ 3c454:fig : r : mm : grid ] panels ( a ) and ( c ) , respectively ) . moreover , the radio flux density increase is smooth and longer in time , while and optical flares are evolving faster .    at 230",
    "ghz the flux density variability mimics the vlbi radio core properties to mjd  54600 , when a large flux density increase is visible , with a peak at about mjd  54630 . at this frequency",
    "the source remains in an active phase up to mjd  54700 ( figure  [ 3c454:fig : r : mm : grid ] , panel ( b ) ) .",
    "this poses an interesting question as to the nature of such an increase of the core radio flux .",
    "as reported in @xcite it is likely that the emitting region is more compact and has a smaller bulk lorentz factor closer to the supermassive black hole .",
    "we can assume that in the region active at 43  ghz , in the quiescent state , the jet lorentz factor is @xmath143 @xcite . to obtain the flux density increase of the core at 43  ghz ( from @xmath40 5 jy up to 25 jy ) the doppler factor has to increase up to @xmath144 .",
    "such an increase requires that the source is oriented at a small angle @xmath145 with respect to the line of sight , since a large change in the jet velocity will produce a small increase in the doppler factor .",
    "a doppler factor @xmath146 can be obtained if @xmath147 and @xmath148 , corresponding to a bulk velocity increase from 0.9950 to 0.9987 ( note that a larger orientation angle , e.g. @xmath149 with the same increase in the jet velocity , will produce a small change in the doppler factor @xmath150 , from 16 to 19 ) .",
    "the presence of one or more new jet components is not revealed in the high resolution vlba images , even if the most recent vlba images at 43  ghz suggest a jet expansion near to the radio core starting from mjd @xmath40 54600 . because of different properties ( multiple bursts at high frequency , a single peak in the radio band ) it is not possible to correlate the radio peak with a single or optical burst .",
    "we can speculate that a multiple source activity in the optical and bands is integrated in the radio emitting region in a single event .",
    "this event ( see figure  [ 3c454:fig : vlbi : components ] ) has a clear flux density peak on mjd @xmath40 54720 and we can assume that 43  ghz is the self - absorption frequency at that epoch .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the one discussed by @xcite ( see their figure 3 ) .    according to @xcite , the self - absorption frequency , the source size , flux density , and the magnetic field",
    "are correlated as follows , @xmath151 where @xmath84 is the magnetic field in gauss , @xmath145 the angular size in mas ( note that @xmath152 , where hpbw is the half power beam width ) , @xmath153 is the frequency ( in ghz ) of the maximum flux density @xmath154 ( in jy ) , and @xmath150 is the doppler factor , respectively .",
    "moreover , we assume a particular value ( @xmath155 ) of spectral index in the optically thin part of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "thus , we can use the radio vlbi data at 43  ghz to constrain the physical properties in the region where the source will start to be visible at at this frequency .",
    "the angular resolution in the jet direction of vlba data at 43  ghz is @xmath40 0.14 mas corresponding ( as discussed in @xcite ) to @xmath156 mas .",
    "assuming @xmath146 , we obtain @xmath157 gauss .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that when the source is even smaller , the emission in the radio band is not visible being self - absorbed , and that the local magnetic field is @xmath158 gauss when we start to detect the radio emission .",
    "the size of this region should be smaller than 0.25 mas ( about 2  pc ) .",
    "the correlation between the flux level and the spectral slope in the energy band was extensively studied by means of the analysis of the data .",
    "@xcite showed that the behavior of egret blazars is inhomogeneous .",
    "figure  [ 3c454:fig:1yr_grid_hyster ] shows the /grid photon index as a function of the flux at different epochs .",
    "a `` harder - when - brighter '' trend seems to be present in the long time scale data .",
    "further long term observations of and of other bright blazars at different flux levels with and will be crucial to assess this topic .",
    "different emission mechanisms can be invoked to explain the emission . in the leptonic scenario ,",

    "emission from both of them were detected during faint states of the source @xcite .",
    "the emission along the jet is assumed to be produced in a spherical blob with comoving radius @xmath102 by accelerated electrons characterized by a comoving broken power law energy density distribution of the form , @xmath159 where @xmath10 is the electron lorentz factor assumed to vary between @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the pre and post  break electron distribution spectral indices , respectively , and @xmath163 is the break energy lorentz factor .",

    "our modeling of the high - energy emission is based on an inverse compton model with two main sources of external target photons : ( 1 ) an accretion disk characterized by a blackbody spectrum peaking in the uv with a bolometric luminosity @xmath167 for an ic - scattering blob at a distance @xmath168 cm from the central part of the disk ; ( 2 ) a broad line region with a spectrum peaking in the @xmath83 band , placed at a distance from the blob of @xmath169 cm , and assumed to reprocess @xmath170 of the irradiating continuum ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we report on eighteen months of multiwavelength observations of the blazar 3c  454.3 ( _ crazy diamond _ ) carried out in the period july 2007 - january 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show the results of the campaigns which took place on may  </S>",
    "<S> june 2008 , july  august 2008 , and october 2008 - january 2009 . during the may 2008 - january 2009 period , </S>",
    "<S> the source average flux was highly variable , with a clear fading trend towards the end of the period , from an average flux @xmath0 in may  </S>",
    "<S> june 2008 , to @xmath1 in october 2008 - january 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> the average spectrum between 100  mev and 1  gev can be fit by a simple power law , showing a moderate softening ( from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) towards the end of the observing campaign . </S>",
    "<S> only @xmath4 upper limits can be derived in the 2060  kev energy band with super - agile , because the source was considerably off - axis during the whole time period .    in july  august 2007 and may  </S>",
    "<S> june 2008 , 3c  454.3 was monitored by rxte . </S>",
    "<S> the /pca light curve in the 320 kev energy band shows variability correlated with the one . the /pca average flux during the two time periods is @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively , while the spectrum ( a power - law with photon index @xmath7 does not show any significant variability . </S>",
    "<S> consistent results are obtained with the analysis of the /hexte quasi - simultaneous data .    </S>",
    "<S> we also carried out simultaneous observations during all campaigns . </S>",
    "<S> /xrt detected with an observed flux in the 210  kev energy band in the range @xmath8 and a photon index in the range @xmath9 . in the 15150  kev energy band , </S>",
    "<S> when detected , the source has an average flux of about 5  mcrab . </S>",
    "<S> gasp - webt monitored during the whole 20072008 period in the radio , millimeter , near - ir , and optical bands . </S>",
    "<S> the observations show an extremely variable behavior at all frequencies , with flux peaks almost simultaneous with those at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> a correlation analysis between the optical and the fluxes shows that the @xmath10-optical correlation occurs with a time lag of @xmath11 days , consistent with previous findings for this source . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of 15  ghz and 43  ghz vlbi core radio flux observations in the period 2007 july - 2009 february shows an increasing trend of the core radio flux , anti - correlated with the higher frequency data , allowing us to derive the value of the source magnetic field . finally , the modeling of the broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for the still unpublished data , and the behavior of the long - term light curves in different energy bands , allow us to compare the jet properties during different emission states , and to study the geometrical properties of the jet on a time - span longer than one year . </S>"
