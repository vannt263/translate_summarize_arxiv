    "the star trackers on the _ mons _ satellite ( bedding & kjeldsen , these proceedings ) should produce exquisite light curves for many hundreds of red giant stars . these observations , made over about 30 days with high duty cycle , will allow a number of questions to be addressed .",
    "classes of stars are discussed in order of decreasing effective temperature , starting with the mira variables .",
    "miras have the largest amplitudes and longest periods of all pulsating stars . what can we then hope to learn by studying them at high precision over a month , which is only a small fraction of a pulsation cycle ?",
    "@xcite has collected 14 cases of flares reported on miras , lasting minutes to hours and having amplitudes up to a magnitude .",
    "a systematic study by @xcite found short - term variations in the photographic light curves 18 long - period variables in m  16 , with amplitudes @xmath0 magnitudes and durations 130 days .",
    "most recently , @xcite detected variations from _",
    "hipparcos _ photometry of miras , with amplitudes 0.2 to 1.1 magnitudes and durations from 2 hours up to 6 days . in some cases ,",
    "repeat events were observed on the same star ( see fig .  [ fig.xhya ] ) .",
    "the origin of these short - term variations is not clear , but they are presumably due to rapid and probably localized temperature changes . one possible cause might be the arrival at the surface of an unusually large convection cell . given the high precision of the _ mons _ star trackers , we should expect to see a distribution of events down to much smaller amplitudes .",
    "two - colour information would be especially useful for shedding light on this phenomenon .",
    "@xcite ( 2000 ) have studied what they describe as rapidly oscillating m giant stars .",
    "they present a few dozen m giants that were discovered by _",
    "hipparcos _ to have periods shorter than 10 days and amplitudes up to a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the only viable explanation seems to be pulsation in very high overtones , and some stars shows signs of multiple periodicities .",
    "@xcite list about 35 stars with periods less than 10 days , having @xmath1 magnitudes from 5.4 to 8.9 and amplitudes mostly below 0.1mag .",
    "several of these stars will be observed by the _ mons _ star trackers , and the light curves should allow a proper frequency analysis for multiple modes .",
    "it has been established from ground - based photometry that variability in red giants decreases in amplitude as one moves down the spectral sequence from m to k ( @xcite , @xcite ) . with",
    "the kappa mechanism no longer functioning , excitation is presumably due to convection .",
    "periods become shorter as stellar density increases , and variablility becomes less regular , presumably due to the stochastic nature of the excitation process and/or to the presence of multiple modes .",
    "a few bright k giants show radial - velocity ( rv ) variations that could be due to oscillations , but it has proved difficult to obtain time series that are long and continuous enough to resolve the frequency spectrum .",
    "matters are complicated by the presence of long - term variations ( hundreds of days ) , which could be due to pulsation , rotational modulation or low - mass companions ( e.g. , @xcite , 1999 ) .",
    "the best - studied example is arcturus ( @xmath2  boo ) , which has been found to have short - term rv variations with periods of a few days ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , as well as long - term variations with a period of a few hundred days ( @xcite ) .",
    "this star will definitely be observed by the _ mons _",
    "star trackers , since it lies close to @xmath3  boo , a high - priority primary target .",
    "it is not clear whether 30 - 50d will be long enough to produce a usable oscillation spectrum , but nearly - continuous coverage over this period will produce a time series far better than any rv observations so far obtained .",
    "_ hipparcos _ photometry of 14 bright k giants .",
    "small diamonds with error bars are individual measurements , while larger diamonds ( connected by a line ) are means in one - day bins .",
    "the horizontal axis shows jd minus 2400000 , and the vertical axis in each case has a range of 0.1 magnitudes , with the horizontal lines showing the means of the observations . ]",
    "figure  [ fig.kgiants ] shows _ hipparcos _ light curves for a sample of the brightest k  giants ( many of which are also known to be rv variables ) .",
    "suprisingly , these light curves have not yet been discussed in the literature .",
    "we see clear evidence for photometric variability in several stars , and we can confirm that arcturus is indeed a variable star , with peak - to - peak variations of about 0.04mag .",
    "another interesting case is @xmath4  her , for which @xcite obtained rv measurements over two years that showed variability with a period of about 600d .",
    "they pointed out that if rotational modulation of surface structure were the cause , one would expect photometric variations of about 0.1mag ( peak - to - peak ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "light curve was obtained at roughly the same time and shows some evidence for slow variability , but at level about ten times smaller than this , allowing us to rule out spots as the cause of the rv variations in @xmath4  her .",
    "photometric variability in k  giants has previously been seen in globular clusters .",
    "@xcite observed 47  tuc with the _ hubble space telescope _ over 38.5hr and found variables with periods of 24 days and semi - amplitudes of 515mmag .",
    "@xcite detected 15 red variables in 47  tuc from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) , which had poorer precision but much better temporal coverage .",
    "their k - giant variables have periods of 236d and semi - amplitudes of 4090mmag .",
    "interestingly , both these observations are predated by a report by @xcite of a red giant variable in the globular cluster m  15 , with a period of 4.3hr and an amplitude of about 20mmag .      finally , we mention the recent exciting results by @xcite ( 2000 and these proceedings ) , who used the star camera on the failed _ wire _ satellite to perform high - precision photometry of the bright k  giant @xmath2  uma .",
    "they produced evidence for multi - mode oscillations in this star with periods of 0.36d and amplitudes of 0.10.4mmag .",
    "data of much higher quality are expected from the _ mons _ star trackers and should produce rich oscillation spectra for a sample of bright k  giants .",
