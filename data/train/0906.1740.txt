    "even though the maximum of the magnetic specific heat @xmath20 of ceni@xmath21cuge@xmath1 reaches less than 15% of the theoretical expected value , the transition was discussed in terms of a reduced long range antiferromagnetic order due to the presence of the kondo - effect @xcite . at a suitable concentration of @xmath22 , where a crossover between single - ion and magnetic ordered behavior occurs",
