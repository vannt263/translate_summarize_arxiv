    "approach is taken to probe the lepton asymmetry of heavy - neutrino decays in high - energy scale by using the masses and the mixing angles of light neutrinos in low energy .    in order to see the effect from the definite size of @xmath6 on the high - energy asymmetry ,",
    "all the elements of pmns matrix are expressed in terms of a single variable @xmath0 except cp phase .",
    "one of the minimal choices is made for seesaw mechanism , which is that yukawa matrix is constructed only with two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we found the way to express @xmath9 dirac mass matrix by matching the light neutrino mass matrix obtained from the seesaw mechanism to the low energy neutrino mass matrix in weak interaction basis .",
    "our previous work on the seesaw mechanism in bottom - up approach was also based on @xmath9 structure for dirac mass , although a texture zero in matrix was forced @xcite .",
    "this work is outlined as follows : the neutrino mass matrix is constructed with masses and unitary transformation in section ii .",

    ", we examine the dependency of the lepton asymmetry on low - energy parameters .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss the correlation of the lepton asymmetry with cp phases in pmns matrix . in conclusion ,",
    "we summarize the relation of the lepton asymmetry with low - energy measurables and the possibility to narrow down the models of seesaw mechanism .",

    "the majorana phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be a part of the mass matrix of light neutrinos in the following way : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the standard parametrization for cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa(ckm ) matrix can be taken for transformation matrix @xmath24 in the pmns such as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath6 from recent reactor anti - neutrino detection allows the following conditions : @xmath30 such deviation from bi - maximal mixing scheme was introduced in a number of models . by substituting eq.([s12 ] ) and eq.([s23 ] ) into eq.([ckm ] ) the neutrino mixing matrix in the leading order can be written as ; @xmath31 suppose @xmath32 in an extreme case of normal hierarchical mass ordering . since only the difference of each majorana phase relative to overall phase becomes physical , one of the majorana phases in eq.([fulltrans ] ) can be removed due to vanishing @xmath33 . the symmetric neutrino mass matrix in eq.([umu ] )",
    "appears as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the quantities related to the imaginary part of pmns are jarlskog invariant @xmath37 and effective electron neutrino mass @xmath38 .",

    "canonical model of seesaw mechanism to suppress neutrino masses below 1 ev using heavy neutrino mass scale requires @xmath42 higgs doublet , whose existence was definitely confirmed .",
    "the lagrangian density for seesaw mechanism consists of yukawa couplings of leptons and lepton - number - violating majorana mass terms of right - handed heavy neutrinos . @xmath43 the minimal model that assumes cp violation from heavy neutrino decay through yukawa coupling requires at least two right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we consider the following particle contents : @xmath44 in the basis mass matrix @xmath45 is diagonal , and @xmath46 in the basis yukawa coupling of charged leptons @xmath47 is diagonal .",

    "it is possible to trace the matrix @xmath51 in terms of light neutrino masses and mixing angles using the seesaw mechanism in opposite direction .",
    "when the @xmath9 yukawa matrix is given by @xmath54 the yukawa couplings are imbedded in symmetric neutrino mass matrix in the following way : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the masses of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , and @xmath60 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath61 .    in comparison of the @xmath62 in terms of low - energy physical parameters eq.([lowmass3 ] ) with the @xmath62 in terms of yukawa couplings eq.([m2seesaw ] ) , we obtained the following relations ; @xmath63 all yakawa couplings are determined in terms of 5 physical values : @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , implying there can be a way to test the model and constrain the scale of seesaw mechanism from experimental measurements .",
    "once we have the neutrino yukawa matrix with the couplings in eq.([yuk11 ] ) and eq.([yuk12 ] ) , we can calculate the magnitude of cp asymmetry @xmath66 in decays of heavy majorana neutrinos @xcite , @xmath67 where @xmath13 denotes a generation .",

    "the baryon asymmetry eq.([baryon ] ) can be rephrased by @xmath84 with the entropy density @xmath85 in order to take into account the number density with respect to a co - moving volume element .",
    "the baryon asymmetry produced through sphaleron process is related to the lepton asymmetry @xcite by @xmath86 with @xmath87 . for the standard model(sm ) , @xmath88 with three generations of fermions and a single higgs doublet .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath89 in eq.([cosmo ] ) can be replaced by @xmath90 .",
    "the generation of a lepton asymmetry requires the cp - asymmetry and out - of - equilibrium condition .",
    "the @xmath91 is explicitly parameterized by two factors , @xmath92 , the size of cp asymmetry , and @xmath93 , the dilution factor from washout process . @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of relativistic degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath93 in eq.([aalepto ] ) is determined by solving the full boltzmann equations .",
    "the @xmath93 can be simply parameterized in terms of @xmath96 , which is defined as the ratio of @xmath97 the tree - level decay width of @xmath58 to @xmath61 the hubble parameter at temperature @xmath56 , @xmath98 .",
    "the condition @xmath99 describes processes out of thermal equilibrium and @xmath100 describes washout effect@xcite , @xmath101 the decay width of @xmath58 by the yukawa interaction at tree level and hubble parameter in terms of temperature @xmath102 and the planck scale @xmath103 are @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . at temperature @xmath106 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath96 is @xmath107 which reduces to @xmath108 since @xmath109 up to the leading order of @xmath39 from eq.([yuk11 ] ) , then the dilution factor @xmath93 depends on the relative scale of @xmath110 and the ratio of light masses @xmath111 , so that @xmath112 which implies that the thermal effect is a matter of mass scales while the cp asymmetry is a matter of complex mixing of particles .    in this framework of bottom - up approach ,",
    "some of low energy quantities can be fixed by best fit in global analysis , @xmath113 where their @xmath7-ranges are given by @xmath114 and by @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2:fig_theta13_contours ] present the contours of lepton asymmetry @xmath116 for @xmath117 given in eq.([bestfit ] ) and a selected scale of @xmath118 .",
    "the region below the size of @xmath91 derived from the cosmological bound @xmath119 is shaded , excluding the corresponding combination of @xmath120 and @xmath8 . both signs of asymmetry are taken into account .",
    "it is clear that the amount of lepton asymmetry can not be reached to the cosmological bound without dirac phase , although they are not proportional to each other . in this model , @xmath121 is excluded regardless other variables in eq.([yl_inputs ] ) as long as their values are considered within phenomenologically allowed ranges .",
    "it is also shown that the variation of @xmath0 within @xmath7 range does not draw a remarkable change in lepton asymmetry @xmath91 , and neither does the variation of @xmath117 in @xmath7 .",
    "the changes in @xmath91 affected by @xmath117 is barely visible .",
    "the experiments of long - baseline oscillation began obtaining results on dirac cp phase .",
    "the red shades in fig.[fig2:fig_theta13_contours ] and fig.[fig3:fig_seesaw_scale ] present the ranges of @xmath8 at 68% and 90% cl obtained by t2k with best fit @xmath122 .",
    "the cp conservation is ruled out at 90% cl .",
    "the amount of lepton asymmetry in eq.([aalepto ] ) is now given as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath120 as well as @xmath118 such as @xmath123 because the variation in @xmath117 and that in @xmath39 do barely affect @xmath91 .",
    "it turns out that the washout effect of asymmetry is mainly affected by the lightest mass of heavy majorana neutrino @xmath56 , in other word , the scale of seesaw mechanism .",
    "it appears as the ratio to the planck scale @xmath118 . according to eq.([smallk ] )",
    ", there is an upper bound 17% to the dilution factor @xmath93 no matter how strong the out - of - equilibrium condition is .",
    "the relation of @xmath96 with @xmath56 in eq.([yukawak ] ) implied that the lower @xmath56 scale becomes , the more asymmetry is washed out , as shown in fig.[fig3:fig_seesaw_scale ] .",
    "the areas enclosed by different contours indicate the cosmological bound derived from different scales of @xmath56 . as the seesaw scale @xmath56 decreases ,",
    "the region for sufficient asymmetry becomes narrower .",
    "for example , the scale @xmath56 below @xmath124 is not compatible with the dirac cp phase within t2k 68% cl .",
    "in a minimal seesaw model with two right - handed neutrinos , the lepton asymmetry @xmath91 for baryogenesis can be probed by low - energy phenomenology . for sufficient @xmath91 ,",
    "the model requires non - zero @xmath8 .",
    "although the size of @xmath91 depends on the values of @xmath117 and @xmath39 , its variations within current uncertainties of those parameters are almost invisible .",
    "once mixing angles are fixed , the asymmetry is described by seesaw - scale factor and by experimentally measurable factor , as shown in eq.([finalyl ] ) .",
    "one can expect that the precise measurement of @xmath8 in future experiments can constrain the right - handed neutrino mass for seesaw mechanism .",
