    "this suppression leads to a pure @xmath6 solution at the edge , an effect we quantify in fig .",

    "[ fig : dja](c ) , @xmath53 varies strongly with @xmath40 , but very little with edge type and doping level .",

    "@xmath40 has far - reaching consequences for graphene .",
    "for example , @xmath56 and doping at the vhs gives @xmath57    for nn pairing . with an expected much weaker",
    "superconducting pairing in real graphene , the edge will not only modify the properties of the superconducting state in graphene nanoribbons , but also in macroscopically sized graphene samples .",
    "we have verified that both the @xmath3  state itself and edge effects described here are stable in the presence of random disorder @xcite .",
    "any @xmath3  state , even with one subdominant part , violates both time - reversal and parity symmetry and has been shown to host two chiral edge states @xcite .",
    "the topological invariant guaranteeing the existence of these two chiral edge modes also causes quantized spin- and thermal - hall responses @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ek](a ) shows the band structure for a zigzag slab .",
    "the self - consistent solution ( thick black ) gives two dirac cones located at @xmath58 , where bands with same velocities reside on the same surface , thus yielding two co - propagating chiral surface states per edge .",
    "the band structure for the constant ( non - self - consistent ) bulk @xmath3  state also has two dirac cones ( thin black ) , but shifted away from @xmath59 .",
    "the shift is directly related to the @xmath6 state at the edge .",
    "the @xmath6 state has no surface states on the zigzag edge , only bulk nodal quasiparticles , where the nodes for a @xmath6 order parameter with amplitude equal to that on the edge are located at @xmath58 ( thin red ) .",
    "the similarity between the @xmath3  and @xmath6 edge band structures thus makes for only modest effects of the edge on the self - consistent band structure .",
    "it also results in the chiral edge modes being well localized to the edge , as seen in the local density of states ( ldos ) plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : ek](b ) .",
    "the constant edge ldos is a consequence of the one - dimensional dirac spectrum .",
    "we note especially that no @xmath0-wave superconducting graphene edge will display a zero - bias conductance peak due to zero - energy surface states , in contrast to the cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "such a peak is only present when the order parameter for incidence angle @xmath60 on the edge has a different sign from when the angle is @xmath61 .",
    "this only happens for the @xmath62-solution on both the zigzag and armchair edge .",
    "the breaking of time - reversal symmetry gives rise to spontaneous edge currents carried by the chiral edge modes @xcite . by combining the charge continuity equation with the heisenberg equation for the particle density @xcite",
    ", we calculate in fig .",
    "[ fig : ek](c ) the quasiparticle edge current as function of of the bulk order parameter @xmath63 .",
    "we find no evidence for a quantized boundary current equal to @xmath64 , as previously suggested @xcite .",
    "in fact , we find a non - linear relationship between current and @xmath27 , a strong variation with doping level , and , most importantly , the armchair current even _ decreases _ when @xmath27 increases . the last result can be understood by studying the zero - energy crossing @xmath58 of the chiral edge modes . for the zigzag edge @xmath59 increases with increasing @xmath27 , whereas for the armchair edge @xmath59 decreases . in general , we find that changes in current are proportional to @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "this , at least , partially agree with earlier results reporting a @xmath67 dependence @xcite .",
    "finite @xmath68-point sampling and neglecting the screening supercurrents could potentially explain the discrepancy .",
    "heavy doping of graphene , by either ad - atom deposition @xcite or gating @xcite , breaks the @xmath69 mirror symmetry and introduces a rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the unit vector from site @xmath72 to @xmath11 .",
    "superconducting two - dimensional systems with rashba spin - orbit coupling and magnetic field have recently attracted much attention due to the possibility of creating majorana fermions at vortex cores or edges @xcite . at edges the majorana fermion appears as a single mode crossing the bulk gap .",
    "this should be contrasted with the behavior found above , where the edge instead hosts two modes .",
    "we will here show that a majorana mode is created in @xmath0-wave superconducting doped graphene in the presence a moderate zeeman field : @xmath73 .",
    "due to spin - mixing in @xmath74 , the basis vector @xmath75 has to be used when expressing the hamiltonian @xmath76 in matrix form : @xmath77 .",
    "this results in a doubling of the number of eigenstates compared to the physical band structure .",
    "this doubling is necessary for the appearance of the majorana fermion , since a regular fermion consists of two majorana fermions .    a change in the number of edge modes marks a topological phase transition which , in general , can only occur when the bulk energy gap closes .",
    "we therefore start by identify the conditions for bulk zero energy solutions of @xmath78 .",
    "close to the vhs we can , to a first approximation , use only the partially occupied @xmath7-band for small @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "a straightforward calculation @xcite for this one - band hamiltonian gives the following bulk - gap closing conditions at @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the band structure , @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the @xmath68-dependent intraband superconducting order for nn pairing @xcite , and @xmath86 $ ] is the spin - orbit interaction when expressed in the form @xmath87 for the one - band model .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : eg ] ) are met at @xmath88 , and @xmath89 in the brillouin zone , where they produce the conditions @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively . at @xmath81",
    "only the last condition is satisfied for small @xmath80 , which is necessary for superconductivity to survive .",
    "we find @xmath93 for the @xmath63 order parameter and , thus , at the vhs there is a topological phase transition at @xmath94 .",
    "figure  [ fig : maj](a ) shows how the eigenvalue spectrum of a superconducting zigzag slab at the vhs develops when @xmath80 is swept past @xmath95 . at finite @xmath96 and/or",
    "@xmath80 the chiral modes in fig .",

    "the bulk gap closes at both @xmath99 .",
    "the closure at @xmath98 annihilates the outer chiral modes whereas the closure at @xmath100 leaves a new dirac cone crossing the bulk band gap with the two modes belonging to different edges .",
    "thus , at @xmath101 we are left with three modes per edge crossing the bulk gap .",
    "the odd number establishes the existence of a majorana mode alongside the two remnant chiral modes .",
    "figure  [ fig : maj](b ) shows how @xmath27 develops in the presence of an applied zeeman field @xmath80 , with @xmath102-symbols marking the phase transition into the phase with a majorana fermion .",
    "the dotted line marks the one - band result @xmath94 , which is a good approximation for small @xmath96 . in this small @xmath96-regime",
    "there is a very pronounced drop in @xmath27 at the phase transition with only a small remnant superconducting state in the majorana phase at @xmath101 , which results in a poorly resolved majorana mode .",
    "larger @xmath96 gives a stronger superconducting state in the majorana phase .",
    "however , for @xmath103 we find @xmath104 , and the superconducting state is again very weak beyond the phase transition .",
    "we thus conclude that , in order to create a majorana fermion at the edge of @xmath0-wave superconducting graphene doped very close to the vhs , a small to moderate rashba spin - orbit coupling , @xmath105 , and a zeeman field of the order of @xmath106 is needed . with reported tunability with electric field @xcite , as well as impurity - induced rashba spin - orbit coupling @xcite ,",
    "@xmath107 is likely within experimental reach in heavily doped graphene .",
    "the zeeman field can be generated by proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator , whereas if applying an external magnetic field , orbital effects also needs to be taken into account .",

    "not until @xmath109 does the majorana mode appear as a pure edge excitation .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the @xmath3  superconducting state in heavily doped graphene is in a pure @xmath6 state on any edge .",
    "the @xmath6 edge state significantly modifies the superconducting state even in macroscopic graphene samples due to a long decay length .",
