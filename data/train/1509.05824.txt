    "@xcite reads @xmath13 the analysis within ref .",
    "@xcite has first focused on a one - loop expansion .",
    "this latter entails considering the effective action @xmath14 the constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 are of order one , and depend on the number of colors @xmath11 of the su(n ) gauge - group . relying on the form of the effective lagrangian that has been derived for the asymptotically free regime , it has been shown that when the minimum is attained , namely when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the energy density becomes @xmath19 the equation of state then reads like the one of dark energy , namely @xmath20      the issue of proving that the dark energy behavior of ymc is stable with respect to higher order loop - corrections has been addressed in @xcite and @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the analysis has resorted to the two - loops effective lagrangian , @xmath21\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] derived within the asymptotically - free regime and then extended to the infrared confining regime , in the range of values for @xmath1 in which @xmath22 has a minimum .",

    "notice however that , moving from the expression of @xmath22 determined in the asymptotically - free regime , while reaching the range of values for @xmath33 that ensure a dark energy behavior for the universe , a divergence is encountered in the effective coupling constant @xmath34 . although divergences do not occur in the observable quantities , which are the pressure @xmath35 , the energy density @xmath36 , and their ratio @xmath37 , the occurrence of a divergence in @xmath34 makes less trivial the act of relying on the extension of this procedure to higher - order loop expansions .",
    "nevertheless , for the purposes of an analysis of the dark energy behavior , it has been shown that all the physical quantities behave like smooth functions in the range of the infrared values @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the stability of the system accounting for interactions with matter and electromagnetic radiation , into which the ymc may decay , has been successfully checked . to achieve this goal , in @xcite",
    "the authors have considered : the dynamical system provided by the first friedmann equation in presence of matter with energy density @xmath39 and ( electro - magnetic ) radiation with energy density @xmath40 @xmath41 the equations of motion for the energy densities component of ymc , matter and radiation that arise from conservation of the total energy - momentum tensor and from the decay of the ymc into matter . in comoving coordinates , in which @xmath42 , these latter equations read @xmath43 the decay rate @xmath44 is a free parameter of the model that enters the definition of the dimensionless dynamical system to be solved , equation ( [ h ] ) and equations ( [ emt ] ) .",
    "the specific value of the rescaled parameter @xmath45 then affects the attractor coefficients in the analysis of the stability of the model .",
    "consistency with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , with the fractional density observed for dark energy ( @xmath46 ) and with the observational constraint on the equivalence between the energy densities of radiation and matter at the redshift of recombination , then set the initial conditions of the dynamical variables .",
    "finally , the model has been shown to posses a dark energy tracking solution , and the dynamical system to have a fixed point , which is stable . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the parameter of the equation of state takes the asymptotic value @xmath48 , provided that in @xmath22 one sets up @xmath49 .",
    "a different value of this latter parameter , for instance @xmath50 , would rather entail @xmath51 .",
    "a further analysis , developed along the same lines as the one reported above , has been deepened by the same authors in @xcite , and the investigation extended to the case of the three - loops effective action . within this latter work ,",
    "the effective three - loops coupling constant reads @xmath52 \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the main predictions have been substantially unaffected by the improvement in the perturbative analysis . for different choices of @xmath53 , which is the decay rate parameter rescaled by @xmath54 evaluated at present time , the parameter of the equation of state at present time takes the values @xmath55 ( given that @xmath56 ) or @xmath57 ( given that @xmath58 ) .",
    "we emphasize that in both cases summarized above , the two - loops expansion within @xcite and the three - loops expansion within @xcite , the dark energy behavior arises from the perturbative computation of the effective lagrangian in the asymptomatically - free limit .",
    "the validity of this procedure is then extended to the infra - red regime of the yang - mills theory , in order to recover a minimum in @xmath1 for the effective lagrangian , and derive the equation of state for the universe , which entails accelerated expansion .",
    "but the occurrence of divergences in the effective action may shed some doubts on the validity of the conclusions for the dark energy behavior of the theory .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the gauge interactions taken into account here might not be necessarily considered to be the ones constituting the standard model of particle physics .",
    "it is interesting to notice that an extra `` dark sector '' might be advocated to explain the gauge group here involved .",
    "furthermore , it might be tempting to identify the gauge group copies with suitable candidates for dark matter , postulating the existence of `` dark copies '' of fermions colored under the extra `` dark gauge group '' .",
    "the dark matter sector that is then introduced may eventually be connected to mirror standard model theories @xcite discussed in the literature .",
    "within previous studies @xcite , the existence and the stability of a dark energy mechanism based on ymc has been investigated .",
    "the analyses have been developed moving from the ultraviolet results recovered in the literature , up to three - loops in the effective action for yang - mills su(n ) fields , and results have been then extended in @xcite to the infrared regime , in order to derive a physical characterization of an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "an important technical issue is that one that concerns the stability of the result at higher loops expansion , since the appearance of additional term in the effective action might indeed spoil stability , which totally relies on ultraviolet perturbative expansion .",
    "furthermore , we know that the infrared regime of yang - mills su(n ) theories has a completely different behavior than the ultraviolet regime , the latter encoding asymptotic freedom , while the former showing a confinement behavior that depends on the number of gauge colors involved , and even on the number of colored fermions involved in the theory .",
    "therefore , the main motivation of this study has been to prove that under mild and general assumptions , which are basically the existence of a minimum in @xmath1 in the non - perturbative effective lagrangian , a dark energy behavior is recovered .",
    "then by making use of the non - perturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalization group procedure , which is more adequate to be used in the confining infrared limit of the theory , it is possible to prove that a such a minimum indeed exists .    at this purpose , we provided the explicit example of the su(2 ) yang - mills action , deriving the effective lagrangian for such a particular model and deepening the cases in which interactions with different forms of matter is considered .",
    "the procedure , which might not be completely reliable for the precise determination of the coefficients of the effective non - perturbative lagrangian , is nevertheless enough to ensure that a minimum of @xmath1 exists for @xmath22 , and thus that a ymc works as reliable candidate to explain the origin of dark energy . in the following sections , we unfold detailed arguments in support of this thesis .      within the perturbative ymc model for dark energy that we have reviewed in the previous section ,",
    "the effective yang - mills lagrangian is that one calculated at one - loop in the seminal work by savvidy @xcite , namely @xmath59 where @xmath60 for su(n ) .",
    "higher - loops correction have been then deployed in order to check whether the substance of the physical results remains unchanged , and how the details may vary .",
    "+ instead of keep considering higher - loops improvements of , the main purpose of this work is to start from a general non - perturbative form of the action , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath61 we may then proceed to determine the form of @xmath62 by stating some general requirements that must be fulfilled in order to obtain a ymc that can work to explain the origin of dark energy .",
    "the function @xmath63 will be in general equipped also with an energy scale @xmath8 in analogy with for dimensional reasons .",
    "we notice indeed that @xmath63 must be a ( not necessarily analytic ) function of @xmath1 satisfying the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath62 has a non trivial minimum in @xmath1 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath62 possesses a perturbative limit , which reproduces the one - loop result derived by savvidy @xcite ; 3 .",
    "@xmath62 shows the asymptotic behavior of being at least linear in @xmath1 , which in turn is linear to the bare yang - mills action .",
    "this latter requirement can be formalized as it follows : in the ultraviolet regime @xmath64 it must hold the limit @xmath65    in what follows we will consider for simplicity a pure su@xmath66 yang - mills theory , the gauge field of which is not coupled to any other fundamental matter fields .",
    "we want to stress that su@xmath66 yang - mills fields introduced here , as well as su(n ) yang - mills fields dealt with in @xcite , despite being suitable to build a model for cosmic dark energy should not be necessarily identified as standard model gauge fields .",
    "the introduction of additional copy of su(n ) yang - mills fields might anyway allow to make contact with some mirror standard model theories @xcite that have been advocated in the literature of dark matter .",
    "again , such a link is not necessary for our purposes and will not be analyzed within this investigation of dark energy ymc .",
    "nevertheless it might represent some interesting directions to be followed in forthcoming studies .      in what follows",
    ", we discuss the cosmological consequences of the requirements we demanded above for the non - perturbative effective action , and shed light on the behavior of the ymc for the fate of cosmological dark energy .",

    "we will consider the simplest case of a universe filled only with the ymc , and assume it to be minimally coupled to the gravity .",
    "then the effective action reads for the metric , the riemann tensor and einstein equation respectively . ]",
    "@xmath70 ~d^{4}x .",

    "( [ l_eff_np ] ) .",
    "varying @xmath74 with respect to the metric @xmath75 , one obtains the einstein equation @xmath76 , where the energy - momentum tensor of the ymc is given by @xmath77 we may set up a gauge that preserves the isotropy and the homogeneity of the flrw background . we write gauge fields as functions of the cosmological time @xmath68 , and choose their components so to satisfy @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this choice indeed ensures that the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath80 is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "we then introduce the usual definition of the yang - mills tensor , cast in terms of the group structure constants @xmath81 , namely @xmath82 for the su@xmath66 gauge - group to which we are specializing our analysis , the structure constants reduce to @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the gauge fixing we have selected above , and looking at the case of constant electric field ( we will assume for simplicity in the following a vanishing magnetic field ) , we can rewrite the yang - mills tensor in the simplified form @xmath84 this allows to express @xmath1 in a very simple form , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath85 , and each component of the energy - momentum tensor then rewrites as @xmath86 these tensors are not yet isotropic , their values depending on the direction of the color @xmath87 .",
    "nevertheless , the total energy - momentum tensor @xmath88 is isotropic , and the corresponding energy density and pressure are given by @xmath89 consequently the equation of state ( eos ) of the ymc is immediately recovered to be @xmath90 it is worth discussing the mathematical properties of the eos @xmath91 .",
    "on one hand , if we require the yang - mills theory to condensate , then the function @xmath63 must has a non trivial minimum , as we demanded in sec .",
    "but this is equivalent to require that @xmath92 vanish at some point @xmath93 . in this point",
    "the ymc has an eos of the cosmological constant with @xmath94 . around this critical point",
    "the ymc dark energy models can account either for an eos characterized by @xmath95 or for an eos characterized by @xmath96 , thus encoding phantom matter behavior .",
    "on the other hand , in the high - energy - scale regime , in which with @xmath97 , one would like to recover that the ymc exhibits an eos of radiation , characterized by @xmath98 , in analogy with the perturbative analysis @xcite . within the framework of the non - perturbative action",
    ", this corresponds to the third requirement listed in sec .",
    "the effective action should then scale for @xmath97 at least like the bare yang - mills action , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath99 .",
    "+ in the following sections , we will show in detail that the ymc evolves from the eos with @xmath98 to @xmath94 while the universe is expanding .",
    "the cosmological model we are about to analyze in this section entails three different sources for the energy - momentum tensor : i ) the dark energy , the role of which we assume to be played by the ymc ; ii ) the matter , including both baryons and dark matter , which is dealt with as non - relativistic dust with negligible pressure ; iii ) the radiation , the component of which consists of photons and possibly other massless particles , such as neutrinos .",
    "we will describe the three components in terms of their eos , without accounting for any microscopic treatment in terms of fundamental matter fields .",
    "+ since from eq .",
    "( [ flrw ] ) we assumed _ ab initio _ the universe to be flat , fractional densities will sum up to one , namely @xmath100 .",
    "indeed , fractional energy densities are defined as @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and the total energy density is given by @xmath104 .",
    "the overall expansion of the universe is determined by the friedmann equations : @xmath105 where the _ dot _ denotes the @xmath106 .",
    "as a first preliminary investigation , we will assume that there is no interaction between the three energy components .",
    "the dynamical evolution of these latter is determined by their equations of motion , which in turn follow from imposing the conservation of each component of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath107 from eqs .",
    "and , we can immediately obtain the standard evolutions of the matter and radiation components , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "a less obvious but still rather simple task is solving the evolution of the ymc component .",

    "at very high redshift , eq . entails an increase of the order - parameter @xmath1 that involves the limit @xmath113 .",
    "thus , at very - high redshift the system transits towards the ultraviolet regime . within this limit ,",
    "eq . encodes the eos parameter @xmath114 .",
    "the ymc then starts behaving as the radiation component , as one would have expected since the theory is evolving towards asymptotic freedom at high energy . at small redshift",
    ", the expansion of the universe requires the lhs of eq . to vanish , which occurs for the extremal value of @xmath115 , and the eos parameter then converges towards @xmath94 .",
    "this ensure that the ymc behaves as an effective cosmological constant .",
    "+ finally , notice that we may proceed as in @xcite , and take advantage of the observational constraint on the ratio between the dark - energy - density and the critical energy density , in order to fix the energy - scale @xmath116 that appears in the effective lagrangian @xmath62 .",
    "the effective lagrangian is no more dependent on the parameter @xmath8 , and we can rescale @xmath1 as in the previous literature .      in this section ,",
    "we generalize the ymc dark energy model and take into account some effective interaction with dust matter . nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity , at this first stage of the analysis we will disregard the interaction between radiation and the ymc .",

    "its possible form will be addressed later .",
    "if the ymc transfers energy to the matter , for instance if the ymc decays into pairs of matter particles , we should require the parameter @xmath117 to be positive .",

    "we parametrize the interaction as proportional to the ymc energy - density , namely @xmath130 . the trivial case @xmath131 reduces to the free ymc dark energy model studied above .",

    "we keep analyzing a ym theory that enjoys a su(2 ) gauge group , and show at non - perturbative level that a ymc forms that drives accelerated expansion of the universe at small redshift .",
    "the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach to non - abelian gauge theories will be particularly fruitful to our purposes , as it allows to introduce non - perturbative methods that can be treated as much as it is possible analytically .",
    "the frg approach is a tool developed to study interacting qft and statistical systems in the non - perturbative regime , where no small coupling exists and perturbative techniques are not applicable .",
    "the method is based upon a wilsonian momentum - shell wise integration of the path - integral : a mass - like regulator function @xmath152 suppresses quantum fluctuations with momenta lower than an ir momentum cutoff scale @xmath153 .",

    "indeed , it would be tempting to try to link ymc dark energy models to other models for dark matter , such as the ones referred to in the literature @xcite as mirror standard model for dark matter .",

    "the quadratic part of this action in the fluctuation field is    @xmath203    where the bar quantities are made out of the background fields . to compute the inverse propagator we need to add also a gauge fixing action and the corresponding faddeev - popov ghost action : @xmath204 the frge splits into the trace over the transverse part and the longitudinal part of the connection field and the ghost sector : @xmath205 calculations are simplified by the fact that in the landau gauge @xmath167 the longitudinal trace",
    "can be dropped out completely .",
    "we may choose a background field configuration that allows to project onto the effective potential @xmath62 .",
    "hence a covariantly constant field strength with @xmath206 suffices . since the spectrum of the laplace - type operators , like @xmath207 , or at least the heat - kernel trace for these operators has to be known",
    ", we have a limited choice in the possible background field configurations . to avoid problems with tachyonic modes , which indicate the instability of a background , we project onto the only known stable covariantly constant background , which is self - dual , namely @xmath208",

    "apart from @xmath210 all other non - zero components follow from the antisymmetry of the field strength tensor . due to the enhanced symmetry properties connected to the self - duality , zero modes exist .",
