    "ab aurigae ( hd 31293 ) is one of the brightest and best studied herbig ae stars , which are considered to be pre - main - sequence stars of intermediate mass ( about 2  10 m@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the star ( spectral type a0ve+sh ) is about 2 myr old and is located at a distance of 144@xmath9 pc from the sun @xcite . like most herbig ae",
    "/ be stars , ab aur is surrounded by circumstellar gas and dust , some of which is distributed in a disk about the star .",
    "standard stellar theory predicts that herbig ae / be stars should not have convective layers , and therefore , should not have chromospheres , coronae , or strong stellar winds .",
    "however , ab aur and most other herbig ae / be stars do show chromospheric and wind features @xcite .",
    "the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) provides high - resolution access to a portion of the ab aur spectrum previously observed only at low spectral resolution with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope_. in this letter , we present _ fuse _ observations of ab aur , including the first observation of hot  gas ( @xmath10 k ) and cold molecular hydrogen .",
    "the  emission should provide an important constraint on any models of the stellar activity seen in the ab aur system .",
    "we also present a simultaneous observation of ab aur with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) ; this observation strongly complements the _ fuse _ observations by providing column densities of and co.",
    "ab aurigae was observed with _ fuse _ on 2000 february 27 and 28 , for a total exposure time of 13.7 ks .",
    "the data were obtained using the low - resolution aperture ( lwrs ) , and alignment of the four channels ( lif 1 , lif 2 , sic 1 , and sic 2 ) was maintained throughout the whole observation ( see @xcite for a more detailed explanation ) .",
    "the data were flux calibrated using _",
    "calfuse 1.6.8 _ pipeline processing software , but more recent wavelength solutions ( 2000 june 19 ) were used for our analysis .",
    "we obtained a s / n of about 5 per 12-pixel resolution element in the lif 1a segment ( near 1060  ) , and about 7 in the lif 1b segment ( near 1140  ) .    the wavelength solutions used provide good relative calibration across the lif channels .",
    "however , they have significant zero - point offsets . in order to establish the absolute wavelength calibration of our spectra",
    ", we made use of the simultaneous stis observation of ab aur described in  5 . assuming that our h@xmath0  gas is located in the same region and is at the same velocity as the carbon monoxide gas observed in the stis spectrum , we set @xmath11 km  s@xmath12 , which is close to the heliocentric radial velocity of the star ( @xmath13 km  s@xmath12 )",
    "the spectrum in figure  1a shows signal from ab aur down to  at 977  , and is rich in emission and absorption features , many of which we have not yet been able to identify .",
    "the stellar photosphere flux drops off sharply at around 1270   ( figure  1b ) , so virtually all the observed flux in the _ fuse _ bandpass is due to a forest of emission lines and possibly some far - uv excess continuum of uncertain origin .",
    "the  emission doublet in the lif 1a segment spectrum is shown in figure  2a .",
    "the @xmath141038 line is suppressed by h@xmath0  absorption ; two narrow h@xmath0  lines are also superimposed on the @xmath141032 line .",
    "these two narrow lines were masked out of the data , and a gaussian model was least - squares fitted to the spectrum between 1029   and 1035  .",
    "a model for the  doublet was created using this gaussian fit , assuming the optically thin line ratio 2:1 to model the @xmath141038 line .",
    "this  model was multiplied by the normalized h@xmath0  absorption model discussed in  3.2 ; the result is overplotted on the data in figure  2a , showing how the strong h@xmath0   absorption lines near 1037   and 1039   cut off the wings of the @xmath141038 line , reproducing the peculiar line shape quite well . however",
    ", this analysis indicates that there should be additional flux visible at 1038.8  ; absorption from some other atomic species may be responsible for the lack of observed emission .",
    "the gaussian fit to the @xmath141032 line is redshifted ( @xmath15 km s@xmath12 , corrected for the zero - point offset of the wavelength calibration ) , with a fwhm @xmath16 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the  line profile does not appear to be a standard type i p cygni profile @xcite , because no blueshifted absorption is observed on the small but significant continuum flux around the emission line . while the gaussian model fits the red wing of the @xmath141032 line quite well",
    ", there is excess emission on the blue wing .",
    "this asymmetry in the line - profile suggests that the  emission is formed in ab aur s stellar wind , but this conclusion is tentative until more detailed modeling is complete .    the  @xmath14977 line in the sic 1b segment spectrum is shown in figure  2b .",
    "again , there are narrow h@xmath0  absorption lines superimposed on the emission feature , which were masked out before least - squares fitting a gaussian to the line .",
    "the bulk of the emission is redshifted ( @xmath17 km  s@xmath12 ) , but the  emission feature clearly is not well - described by a single gaussian .",
    "there is an `` absorption feature '' at @xmath18 978  , superimposed on the  emission , that does not arise from h@xmath0 .",
    "the origin of this feature has not yet been determined , but it is not likely to be interstellar , because of its large redshift and width .",
    "the h@xmath0  absorption features visible in our _ fuse _ spectrum do not show any evidence of multiple velocity components .",
    "the lif 1a and lif 2a data were normalized with simple continua found from linear fits to the spectrum between 1040   and 1120  .",
    "our h@xmath0  absorption model was generated using molecular data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "voigt line - profiles were used to create transmission functions , which were then convolved with a gaussian instrumental line - spread function with @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 statistic between the model and the data was minimized to find the best model parameters , with @xmath21 error bars determined from the contours of @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity of the gas was found by least - squares fitting gaussians to a number of narrow lines between 1050   and 1120  .",
    "we measured @xmath22 km  s@xmath12 , but set this value to the stis carbon monoxide velocity , @xmath23 km  s@xmath12 , to determine the zero - point offset of our wavelength calibration .",
    "since the relative populations of h@xmath0  energy levels with @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined primarily by thermal collisions , the excitation temperature found from these levels should be close to the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "however , the populations of the higher levels ( @xmath26 ) can be inflated by uv and/or formation pumping and by radiative cascade @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low @xmath27 and high @xmath27 levels were analyzed separately .",
    "windows containing only lines arising from the @xmath28 levels in the five bands between 1048   and 1120   were cut out of the normalized lif 1a and lif 2a data and @xmath20 minimization performed using a model containing only these lines .",
    "we permitted the model to have a slightly different velocity shift for each of the windows , to eliminate any systematic errors arising from the uncertainty in the h@xmath0  velocity determination .",
    "the parameters of the model were @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the column densities in the @xmath28 levels respectively , and @xmath32 , the doppler broadening parameter . from the ratio @xmath3 , we calculate the gas kinetic temperature of the h@xmath0 , @xmath33 k. to analyze the high @xmath27 lines , we again cut windows containing only lines arising from @xmath26 out of the data , and performed @xmath20 minimization using a model containing only those lines .",
    "we find the excitation temperature of the high @xmath27 lines to be @xmath34 k. the column densities of molecules in each rotational level were summed to find the total h@xmath0  column density , @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the final best two - temperature model is shown overplotted on a portion of the lif 1a spectrum in figure  3a .",
    "ab aur was observed by _ hst _ on 2000 february 28 . a total exposure time of 1813 s",
    "was obtained using the e140 m echelle grating and the @xmath35 spectroscopic slit .",
    "the spectrum covered 11501725   with a resolution of @xmath36 46,000 .",
    "the data were reduced using the stis idt software _",
    "calstis_. echelle spectra are subject to interorder scattered light ; to compensate for this , we used the algorithm developed by don lindler and discussed in @xcite , which accurately achieves zero flux in the trough of the interstellar ly@xmath37 absorption .",
    "the stis wavelength scale in this mode is accurate to 3 km  s@xmath12  @xcite . the spectrum between 1200   and 1300   is shown in figure 1b .",
    "longward of 1300  , the spectrum resembles an early a star with the heavy line blanketing typical of herbig ae stars in the uv . the stis spectrum reached a continuum s / n=20.6 near 1471  , and s / n=16 near 1504  .",
    "the s / n at shorter wavelengths is lower , s / n @xmath38 per 0.2   bin at lyman @xmath37 .",
    "the stis spectrum of ab aur is rich in emission lines from a wide range of ionization states .",
    "the data shortward of 1310   show type i p cygni profiles arising from the low - ionization species and , and more complex emission profiles in and  @xmath141176 .",
    "the measured color index of ab aur , ( b  v ) , is 0.12 .",
    "iue low - dispersion spectra of ab aur ( swp 24389 ) were unreddened using the interstellar excinction law of @xcite .",
    "comparison with unreddened spectral standards suggests that the best overall match in the fuv is @xmath40 uma , type a0 v ( swp 8198 ) , with ( b  v)@xmath41 and r = 3.1 .",
    "we therefore find the selective extinction toward ab aur , @xmath42 , and the general extinction , @xmath43 .",
    "lyman @xmath37 emission is formed in the chromosphere of ab aur , and it appears likely that the chromosphere is expanding , based on profiles of other low - ionization species .",
    "since these line - profiles in the stis spectrum of ab aur are observed to be type i p cygni profiles , with the emission extending down to the stellar radial velocity , it is likely that the intrinsic lyman @xmath37 profile is a type i p cygni profile as well .",
    "however , the short wavelength edge of the observed emission does not extend down to the stellar radial velocity ; this is presumably due to the interstellar lyman @xmath37 absorption .",
    "the wavelength at which the interstellar absorption is no longer optically thick , where the observed flux rises above the zero level , is highly sensitive to the interstellar column density , but insensitive to the assumed b - value .",
    "we find @xmath44@xmath45 toward the star to be @xmath46 @xmath2 . we obtain roughly the same value using several different assumptions about the underlying continuum flux .",
    "however , uncertainty about the exact shape of the stellar line - profile could cause the error in this value to be as much as 50% .",
    "future work will refine @xmath44@xmath45 after detailed modeling of ab aur s winds determines the unattenuated stellar flux presented to the interstellar atoms .",
    "the ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 0 ) , and ( 3 - 0 ) bands of the co fourth positive band system ( @xmath47 ) are visible in the stis spectrum ( figure  3b ) .",
    "no lines arising from @xmath48co were observed .",
    "the continua in the vicinity of the bands were fitted with fifth - degree polynomials .",
    "an absorption model was generated using wavelengths and oscillator strengths from @xcite and energies of the ground - state levels were calculated using the dunham coefficients from @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 minimization was performed on all three bands simultaneously to find the best rotational excitation temperature , @xmath49 k , doppler broadening parameter , @xmath50 km  s@xmath12 , column density of @xmath51co , @xmath52 , and velocity centroid , @xmath53 km  s@xmath12 .",
    "we find a total column density of hydrogen atoms , @xmath54@xmath55 @xmath2 , which is typical of a diffuse molecular cloud . the fractional abundance of h@xmath0 , @xmath56 .",
    "only 11 out of 91 stars in the @xcite _ copernicus _ survey of interstellar h@xmath0  show a larger value of @xmath57 , and these sight - lines all have larger values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this might suggest that our line - of - sight to ab aur has an anomalously high molecular fraction , but this conclusion is tentative until further _ fuse _ h@xmath0  measurements of a variety of interstellar environments are complete .",
    "the co@xmath6h@xmath0  ratio is @xmath60 .",
    "we find the gas - to - dust ratio , @xmath61 .",
    "the mean ratio for standard clouds within 2 kpc of the sun is @xmath62 , indicating that our gas - to - dust ratio is not atypical @xcite .",
    "optical coronagraphic images of ab aur show an extended arc of reflection nebulosity to the east of the system , in addition to the circumstellar disk centered on the star @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that such nebulosities are the remnants of the original molecular clouds that collapsed to form low - mass stars .",
    "our values of the various parameters describing the cold h@xmath0and co gasses ( @xmath63 , @xmath59 , @xmath57 , co@xmath6h@xmath0 and @xmath64 ) are consistent with this suggestion , and we believe that the h@xmath0  and co gasses toward ab aur are probably located in a remnant molecular cloud envelope around the star .",
    "the fact that the velocity of the co gas is equal ( within measurement error ) to the stellar radial velocity supports this conclusion .",
    "the molecular gasses are not likely to be located in the circumstellar disk around ab aur , since the disk inclination is such that our line - of - sight to the star does not pass through the disk @xcite .    turning to the hot , highly - ionized gasses , fuv emission lines from  and",
    "are observed in the solar spectrum , and are produced in the transition zone between the chromosphere and the corona . however , detailed modeling of the ( @xmath65 k ) emission previously observed from ab aur with ghrs found that a homogeneous , spherically - symmetric high - temperature zone could not produce the observed emission without producing strong or emission as well , which is not seen @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that small , hot clumps , formed by shocks in a stellar wind , could reproduce the fuv emission lines , as well as the weak x - ray flux observed from ab aur .",
    "future work will determine if the wind - shock model can reproduce the observed emission from  and the higher - temperature ( @xmath66 k ) species .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the nasa - cnes - csa _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ and on nasa - esa _ hubble space telescope _",
