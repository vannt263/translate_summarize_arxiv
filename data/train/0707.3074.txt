    "hence , a `` causal '' operator should be able to represent the evolution of the system according to the ( true ) time arrow , thus the operator can represent a real physical system evolving in time and reveal the differences arising upon time - reversal of the series .    the statistical properties of @xmath6 and @xmath17 have been studied in a variety of models@xcite . in the case of a `` uniform '' distribution @xmath18 ) .",
    "the `` uniform '' distribution ( defined in refs . ) has been analytically studied in ref . and corresponds to the case when @xmath4 are independent and identically distributed ( iid ) positive random variables of finite variance including the case of markovian dichotomous electric signals studied in ref .. the `` uniform '' distribution corresponds to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a continuous probability density function ( pdf ) corresponding to the point probabilities @xmath21 used so far . when @xmath4 of a `` uniform '' distribution are perturbed by a small linear trend , we find@xcite ( see also eq.([bla ] ) , below ) that @xmath22 ( cf . this simple example , which shows that @xmath6 captures the effect of a linear trend , may be considered as clarifying the meaning of @xmath6 , see section v of ref . ) .",

    "the way through which the entropy in natural time captures the influence of the effect of a small linear trend has been studied , as mentioned , in ref . on the basis of the parametric family of pdfs : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 measures the extent of the linear trend .",

    "actually , this is simply the average of the natural time itself : @xmath45 if we consider the fluctuations of this simple measure upon time - reversal , we can obtain information on the long - range dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "we shall show that a measure of the long - range dependence emerges in natural time if we study the dependence of its fluctuations under time - reversal @xmath46 $ ] on the window length @xmath47 that is used for the calculation .",
    "since @xmath48 , we have    @xmath49 = \\text{e } \\left\\ { \\left [ \\sum_{k=1}^l \\frac{k}{l } \\left ( p_k - p_{l - k+1 } \\right ) \\right]^2 \\right\\},\\ ] ]    where the symbol @xmath50 $ ] denotes the expectation value obtained when a window of length @xmath47 is sliding through the time series @xmath4 .",

    "fig.[mf2](d ) ) .    in order to judge the merits or demerits of the procedure proposed here for the determination of the scaling exponent ,",
    "we compare figs.[mf2](b ) and [ mf2](e ) with figs.[mf2](c ) and [ mf2](f ) , respectively , that have been obtained by the well - established dfa method@xcite .",

    "second , very recently , i.e. , on july 2 , 2007 and july 10,2007 , two separate electric signals were recorded at a station labelled pat lying in central greece ( close to patras city ) at 38.32@xmath91n21.90@xmath91e .",

    "an inspection of these values reveals that they obey the conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) and hence both signals can be classified as ses activities .",
    "the procedure for the current study of the subsequent seismicity that occurred after these ses activities is described in the next section .",
    "we discriminate that during the last decade ses activities are publicized _ only _ when their amplitude indicates that the impending earthquake has an expected@xcite magnitude comparable to 6.0 unit or larger .      according to the athens observatory",
    "( the data of which will be used here ) , a strong earthquake ( eq ) with magnitude 5.8-units occurred at 13:43 ut on february 3 , 2007 , with epicenter at @xmath98n @xmath99e , i.e. , almost 80 km to the southwest of the 6.9 eq of january 8 , 2006 , ( cf .",

    "i.e , the normalized power spectrum in natural time @xmath102 as @xmath103 ( see also below ) .",
    "we study how the seismicity evolved after the recording of the ses activities on november 14 , 2006 , at pir station ( which were classified as ses activities in the initially submitted version of the present paper on november 16 , 2006 ) .",

    "if we set the natural time for seismicity zero at the initiation of the ses activity at 17:19 ut on november 14 , 2006 , we form time series of seismic events@xcite in natural time for various time windows as the number @xmath0 of consecutive ( small ) eqs increases .",
    "we then compute the normalized power spectrum @xcite in natural time @xmath102 for each of the time windows .",
    "excerpts of these results , which refer to the values during the periods : ( a ) december 25 , 2006 , to january 17 , 2007 , and ( b ) : january 18 to january 31 , 2007 are depicted with red crosses in fig.[figfasma ] , respectively .",
    "this figure corresponds to the small area b with @xmath109 . in the same figure , we plot in blue the normalized power spectrum obeying the relation@xcite @xmath110 which holds when the system enters the _ critical _ stage ( @xmath111 , where @xmath112 stands for the natural frequency@xcite ) .",

    "a similar behavior is observed in fig.[figfasma](b ) in which we see that a _ coincidence _ occurs at the small event of magnitude 3.6 at 18:40 ut on january 31 , 2007 , i.e. , roughly three days before the strong eq of magnitude 5.8-units that occurred at 13:43 ut on february 3 , 2007 . to ensure that these two coincidences in figs.[figfasma](a ) and ( b ) are _ true _",

    "second , in the examples observed to date@xcite , a few events _ before _ the coincidence leading to the strong eq , the evolving @xmath116 has been found to approach that of eq.(1 ) , i.e. , the blue one in fig.[figfasma ] , from _ below _",
    "this reflects that during this approach the @xmath85-value decreases as the number of events increases ) .",
    "in addition , both values @xmath6 and @xmath114 should be smaller than @xmath25 at the coincidence .",
    "finally , since the process concerned is self - similar ( _ critical _ dynamics ) , the time of the occurrence of the ( true ) coincidence should _ not _ change , in principle , upon changing either the ( surrounding ) area or the magnitude threshold used in the calculation .",

    "they are shown in fig.[f20 ] for m@xmath127=3.4 and reveal the following : after the aforementioned strong earthquake on february 16 , 2009 , the bimodal curve prob(@xmath85 ) versus @xmath85 shows a clear local maximum at @xmath128 0.070 upon the occurrence of the m@xmath129=3.5 event at 00:30 ut on february 18 , 2009 with an epicenter at 34.9@xmath91n23.4@xmath91e .",

    "_ updated note on march 13 , 2009 : _ several hours before the occurrence of the aforementioned magnitude 6.0 earthquake on february 16 , 2009 , an electrical anomaly of significant amplitude , see fig.[fig21 ] , appeared at pir .",
    "it basically consists of three bay like transient changes , thus having a form essentially different than the ses activities that preceded the major earthquakes on february 14 , 2008 and june 8 , 2008 .",
    "this electrical anomaly could be in principle attributed to the 6.0 earthquake on february 16 , 2009 that occurred almost 11 hours later , but this earthquake was also preceded by the ses activity at pir on december 12 , 2008 .",
