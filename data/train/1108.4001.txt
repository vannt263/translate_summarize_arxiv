    "the characterization of quantum correlated multipartite systems has been a central topic in quantum information theory  ( see , e.g. , refs .   for recent discussions ) .",
    "such systems are described by quantum states that can not be represented by joint probability distributions . remarkably",
    ", the existence of quantum correlations may occur even in the absence of entanglement and still be a resource for a number of quantum information applications ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "measures of quantum correlations provide then a valuable tool to recognize useful quantum states for a certain task . in this context ,",
    "an important measure is given by quantum discord ( qd )  @xcite .",
    "it arises as a difference between two expressions for the total correlation in a bipartite system ( as measured by the mutual information ) , which are classically equivalent but distinct in the quantum regime .",
    "qd has been generalized to the multipartite scenario by different approaches  .",
    "unfortunately , both bipartite and multipartite versions of qd involve extremization procedures , which makes their computation viable only for very small systems or for particular classes of states .    in this context , a possible strategy to identify composite systems that do not exhibit purely classical correlations is to look for a witness operator , namely , an observable able to detect the presence of nonclassical states .",
    "a witness @xmath2 is defined here as a hermitian operator whose norm @xmath3 is such that , for all nonclassical states , @xmath4 , with a convenient norm measure adopted .",
    "therefore , @xmath4 is a sufficient condition for nonclassicality ( or , equivalently , a necessary condition for classicality ) .",
    "several investigations for establishing conditions to witness bipartite nonclassical states have recently been carried out  @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to provide a systematic approach to obtaining a witness for nonclassicality in multipartite states , which will be based on their disturbance under local measurements . in turn , such a witness will naturally detect states with a nonvanishing multipartite qd . as an illustration , we will consider arbitrary @xmath0-symmetric states , where the witness operator can be conveniently rewritten in terms of correlation functions so that classicality is found to require either vanishing magnetization in the @xmath5 direction or isotropy of the two - point function in the xy spin plane . in particular , we will apply such results in quantum spin chains , where it will be shown that @xmath3 exhibits a completely different behavior in the cases of @xmath0-symmetric states and states with spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) . in the latter case , a characterization of nontrivial factorized ground states ( with @xmath0 ssb ) will be achieved . as a by - product",
    ", the witness will also be shown to exhibit a nonanalytical behavior at second - order quantum phase transitions .",
    "this nonanalyticity will be revealed by the first derivative of @xmath3 and will be used as a tool to characterize second - order quantum critical points in both the xy and ashkin - teller spin chains .",
    "let us begin by considering a composite system in an @xmath6-partite hilbert space @xmath7 .",
    "the system is characterized by quantum states described by density operators @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of bound , positive - semidefinite operators acting on @xmath10 with trace given by @xmath11 . in order to define a multipartite classical state",
    ", we will generalize the idea of nondisturbance under projective measurements introduced for bipartite states in ref .",
    "indeed , we will denote a set of local von neumann measurements as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 denoting the index string @xmath14 .",
    "then , after a non - selective measurement , the density operator @xmath15 becomes @xmath16 this operation can then be used to define a classical state .    if there exists any measurement @xmath17 such that @xmath18 then @xmath15 describes a _ classical _ state under von neumann local measurements .",
    "therefore , it is always possible to find out a local measurement basis such that a classical state @xmath15 is kept undisturbed . in this case",
    ", we will denote @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the set of @xmath6-partite classical states .",
    "observe that such a definition of classicality coincides with the vanishing of global qd  @xcite .",
    "note also that @xmath21 by itself is a classical state for any @xmath15 , namely , @xmath22 .",
    "hence , @xmath21 can be interpreted as a decohered version of @xmath15 induced by measurement .",
    "a witness for nonclassical states    can be directly obtained from the observation that the elements of the set @xmath17 are eigenprojectors of @xmath15 .",
    "this can be shown by the theorem below ( see also ref .",

    "( [ witness - cf ] ) is sufficient for the nonclassicality of the quantum state .",

    "for the ( dimensionless ) anisotropy parameter @xmath76 , the model reduces to the xx model whereas for all the interval @xmath77 it belongs to the ising universality class , reducing to the transverse field ising model at @xmath78 .",

    ", a second - order quantum critical line takes place for any @xmath77 .",
    "the exact solution of the xy model is well known  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ xy ] ) can be diagonalized via a jordan - wigner map followed by a bogoliubov and fourier transformation .",
    "given the @xmath0 symmetry , the two - spin reduced density operator can be written as @xmath81 ,   \\label{rdo}\\ ] ] where , in terms of the parametrization given in eq .",
    "( [ rhoab ] ) , we have @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 ) . due to the fact that the system is translationally invariant",
    ", the reduced state  ( [ rdo ] ) depends only on the distance between the spins .",
    "we will consider here nearest - neighbor pairs .",
    "the magnetization density @xmath87 and the two - point functions @xmath88 can be directly obtained from the exact solution of the model  @xcite .    in the ordered ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath89 ) , a finite magnetization @xmath90 ( in the coupling direction ) emerges , breaking the @xmath0 symmetry of the hamiltonian for an infinite chain .",
    "this is possible because , at the critical point , the ground state becomes two - fold degenerated , exhibiting opposites values of @xmath90 ( denoted as @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "naturally , a superposition of the two ground states is also a ground state , which could then preserve the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit , these two degenerated ground states are not connected by local unitaries .",
    "thus , to go from one to the other , one needs to flip all the spins at the same time , which is both a highly non - local and energy costly operation .",
    "therefore , a small external perturbation will always pick up one of the two states , and the system will be `` frozen '' at it .",
    "the use of a superposition that preserves the symmetry could be justified in the case of a finite system , where the system , if highly isolated , could exist in such state .",
    "another possibility would be to consider an equal mixture of the two ground states , which could be reasonable in the case one prepares a system at some temperature @xmath93 and cools it down to the limit of @xmath94 .",
    "this is a @xmath0-symmetric state called _ thermal ground state_. note that , since the thermodynamic properties depend only on the energy spectrum ( and not on the eigenstates ) , all choices of ground states will be equivalent . however , classical and quantum correlations _ do _ depend on the eigenstates and , therefore , the symmetric and broken choices of ground states may exhibit different pattern of correlations  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the ground state with ssb exhibits a factorization ( product state ) point at @xmath95 this point identifies a change in the behavior of the correlation functions decay , which pass from monotonically to an oscillatory decay  @xcite . besides , it has been realized that , at this point , the product ground state is two - fold degenerated even for finite systems  @xcite .    in order to apply the witness @xmath3 in the xy model , we will first consider the case of the thermal ( @xmath0-symmetric ) ground state , for which the reduced density matrix is given by eq .",
    "( [ rdo ] ) . for this case , a plot of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath96 is provided in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for @xmath97 .",
    "observe that this plot shows that the only possible classical state appears for @xmath98 . indeed",
    ", this point corresponds to an infinite transverse magnetic field applied , which leads the system to a product state , with all spins individually pointing in the @xmath49 direction . concerning the factorization point given in eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) , it is absent for the thermal state , since the statistical mixture of _ non - orthogonal _ product states exhibits nonvanishing quantum correlations  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if ssb is taken into account , which must be the case in the thermodynamic limit , this picture dramatically changes .",
    "indeed , in the broken case , the two - spin reduced density matrix is more complicated and reads @xmath99 where the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 are given by @xmath102    the evaluation of these functions have been detailed discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where tight lower and upper bounds for @xmath100 and @xmath101 are obtained . in our plots ,",
    "either of such bounds essentially yields the same curves , which led us to keep the results produced with the lower bound . concerning the results for @xmath3 , we can compare the plots for the thermal ground state and the ground state with ssb also in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . observe that , in the case with ssb , the only point for which @xmath103 is @xmath104 . indeed",
    ", this corresponds to a classical state , as can be confirmed by the exact computation of the symmetric qd .",
    "remarkably , this classical state is associated with one of two doubly - degenerated factorized ( fully product ) ground state , which appears as a consequence of the @xmath0 ssb .",
    "this characterization of factorized ground states through @xmath103 can be numerically confirmed in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , where @xmath3 is plotted for a number of different values of the parameter @xmath105 .",
    "these unique classical points for the xy model are then clearly revealed by the witness evaluation .",
    "another aspect of the witness observed from figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] is that it exhibits nonanalyticity in its first derivative at the second - order quantum critical point @xmath106 .",
    "this phenomenon occurs both for the symmetric and broken ground states , which promotes @xmath3 to a simple useful tool also to detect quantum phase transitions .",
    "the ashkin - teller model has been introduced as a generalization of the ising spin-1/2 model to investigate the statitiscs of lattices with four - state interacting sites  @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a rich phase diagram  @xcite and has recently attracted a great deal of attention due to several applications , e.g. , nonabelian anyon models  @xcite and orbital current loops in cuo2-plaquettes of high - tc cuprates  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the quantum ashkin - teller model in one - dimension for a chain with @xmath107 sites is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath111 are independent pauli spin-1/2 operators , @xmath112 is the exchange coupling constant , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are ( dimensionless ) parameters , and periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are adopted , i.e. , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the ashkin - teller model is @xmath118-symmetric , with the hamiltonian commuting with the parity operators @xmath119 therefore , the eigenspace of @xmath120 can be decomposed into four disjoint sectors labelled by the eigenvalues of @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we then numerically diagonalize @xmath120 ( via power method ) to evaluate the witness @xmath3 , which provides a sufficient condition for the absence of @xmath123-symmetric classical states for finite values of @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "we illustrate this result by considering different configurations of multipartite states .",
    "more specifically , we choose a spin quartet , namely , a block of @xmath124 particles described by spin operators @xmath125 , and respective generalization for a spin octet . for such cases , the absence of classical states for any finite @xmath113 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for @xmath126 in a chain with @xmath127 particles .",
    "this is confirmed in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , where the exact behavior of global qd is exhibited .",
    "moreover , besides sufficent for identifying no classical states in the thermal ( @xmath123-symmetric ) ground state of the ashkin - teller chain , the witness @xmath3 can also be applied to identify second - order quantum phase transitions driven by the parameter @xmath114 .",
    "we illustrate this result by plotting @xmath3 for a quartet in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] as a function of @xmath114 for @xmath128 . from this plot ,",
    "a second - order critical point can be readout through a minimum in the derivative of @xmath3 ( see inset in fig .  [ f4 ] ) , which gets pronounced as the length of the chain is increased ( we observe that the maximum appearing in the plot for @xmath129 does _ not _ indicate any transition , since it does not exhibit pronunciation as we increase the size of the chain ) .",
    "this pronounced minimum , which is a typical precursor of the nonanalyticity at the thermodynamic limit , occurs for @xmath130 , which is compatible with the quantum phase diagram in ref .",
    "a further transition would be expected to occur near @xmath131 .",
    "this critical point is not apparent from @xmath3 , at least for chains up to @xmath132 spins .",
    "indeed , this second critical point is usually harder to characterize ( see , e.g. , characterization with entanglement in ref .",
    "@xcite and with global qd in the upper insets of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , where pronunciation is subtle ) .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a multipartite witness for nonclassical states based on their disturbance under local measurements .",
    "this witness provides a sufficient condition for nonclassicality that is in agreement with a nonvanishing global qd . as an illustration , we derived the necessary conditions for classicality in terms of correlation functions for @xmath0-symmetric density operators and apply the witness for both the xy and ashkin - teller chains . remarkably , the witness detects the factorized ground state of the xy chain as its unique classical state ( for finite value of @xmath96 and @xmath105 ) as the ssb was taken into account .",
    "then , in this example , @xmath3 turns out to be not only sufficient but also necessary for nonclassicality .",
    "moreover , the witness was also shown to be able to identify second - order quantum phase transitions through a nonanalyticity in the first derivative of @xmath3 for both xy and ashkin - teller chains .",
    "even though classicality is rare in many - body microscopic systems  @xcite , it is rather useful , as a resource to both quantum information and condensed matter applications , to characterize the existence of nonclassical correlation through simple and direct procedures . in particular , the typicality of states with vanishing genuine @xmath133-partite correlations would be a possible application of our results .",
    "the witness @xmath3 may constitute a helpful tool for such kind of characterization .",
