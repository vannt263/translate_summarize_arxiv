[ fig : n56 ] and correctly predicts the order of magnitude of the escape rate .",
    "the most striking deviation from this general feature are the deep minima , which are located at the positions of the lowest order periodic orbits @xcite . considering a sequence of holes shrinking to a @xmath8-periodic point of the open doubling map , ref .",
    "@xcite shows rigorously that the escape rate is to first order given by @xmath9 observing this estimation in fig .",
    "[ fig : n56 ] we see that it provides an improvement over the naive estimation of eq .   with @xmath10 , and",
    "correctly captures some of the fluctuations in @xmath0 for finite size holes .",
    "( color online ) the escape rate @xmath11 of the open doubling map is plotted as a function of position for holes of size @xmath2 and @xmath3 centered at @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the true values are indicated by the black full curve , the first order approximation of eq .   by the blue squares , while the red dots correspond to the second order approximations calculated in eqs .   and .",
    "the width of each tower produced by the black full curve equals the size of the holes .",
    "the horizontal green line indicates the naive estimate of eq .  .",

    "we could expect that periodic orbits typically reduce the escape rate and therefore @xmath17 would be smaller than @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we will show that for the doubling map and for a large class of fully chaotic markov systems the opposite is true and @xmath18 we will show that inequality can be obtained through an asymptotic expansion to second order in hole size @xmath19 of an exact periodic orbit formula ( see eq . below ) . as seen in fig .",

    "we extend these results to other uniformly hyperbolic systems admitting a finite markov partition including the two dimensional baker map . in sec .",
    "[ sec.exception ] we discuss the case of skewed maps and show how the inequality can be generalized or even broken . finally , in sec .  [ sec.conclusions ] we conclude and discuss the generality of our results , possible extensions to non - markov holes and applications to other research areas such as leaky dynamical networks .",
    "we consider the function @xmath21 describing the density of representative points in phase space @xmath22 at time step @xmath23 which evolves under the action of a deterministic closed map @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath21 can be understood best in the language of operators such that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the perron - frobenius operator associated with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus , the normalized invariant density @xmath28 of @xmath27 is the eigenfunction related to the largest ( in modulus ) eigenvalue of @xmath26 . in ulam s method",
    "@xcite , @xmath26 is approximated by an @xmath29 _ transfer matrix _",
    "@xmath30 with elements corresponding to the transition probabilities between the @xmath31-partitioned phase space .",
    "there has been much work in recent years involving the convergence rates of ulam s method @xcite as @xmath32 as it can be used as a basis for rigorous computations @xcite . for piecewise linear maps admitting a finite markov partition such as",
    "the maps considered here , the leading eigenfunction is piecewise constant , and so the treatment using a finite matrix is exact @xcite .",
    "thus , such maps are called markov maps .    in general , a closed map can be opened by choosing any subset of its phase space @xmath22 as a hole through which trajectories can escape never to return .",
    "for markov maps , it is natural to consider the @xmath33 element of the markov partition as the hole @xmath34 . here , we denote @xmath35 as the open map corresponding to @xmath27 . at each iterate @xmath36 of @xmath35 , a proportion of mass @xmath37",
    "may be lost to @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "typically , in strongly chaotic maps ( e.g. with exponential decay of correlations ) , the proportion of mass remaining in the system decays exponentially with @xmath23 such that the escape rate @xmath40 is well defined . here , @xmath41 is called the survival probability .",
    "the leading eigenfunction of the open perron - frobenius operator @xmath42 associated with @xmath35 is now the _ conditionally _ invariant density @xmath43 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) such that @xmath44 , and the escape rate can be obtained from the leading eigenvalue @xmath45 of @xmath42 through the relation @xmath46 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for markov maps ,",
    "@xmath43 is again piecewise constant and so one looks at the leading eigenvalue of the finite matrix @xmath47 , where the subscript @xmath48 $ ] characterizes the position of @xmath38 and is simply a zero - valued @xmath49 column .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath30 and @xmath50 are non - negative and hence by the perron - frobenius theorem have a real positive eigenvalue ( the perron root ) which is greater or equal in absolute value than all other eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , they are sparse and hence one can utilize preconditioned iterative solvers for fast computations .    for the greater part of this paper we will use the one dimensional doubling map @xmath51 ( mod @xmath52 ) as our paradigm example and later generalize the results to other systems .",
    "we choose the doubling map as it is uniformly expanding and has invariant density @xmath53 on the unit interval , thus making it amenable to analysis with the methods we employ .",
    "in particular , there is a close correspondence between the binary representation of a point @xmath54 , and the symbolic dynamics for the partition @xmath55 \\}$ ] , modulo minor details to do with dyadic rationals ( i.e. fractions with denominator a power of @xmath56 ) , a zero measure set .",
    "hence , with the partition @xmath57 where @xmath582^{-n}$ ] for @xmath59 and @xmath60 $ ] , one can consider the open doubling map @xmath35 with a markov hole @xmath61 of size @xmath62 with respect to the relevant invariant measure of the closed map @xmath27 ( in this case lebesgue ) .",
    "the leading eigenfunction of the corresponding @xmath63 transfer matrix @xmath50 is piecewise constant on these intervals and so the leading eigenvalue can be calculated exactly as the root of a finite polynomial , or numerically to arbitrary precision .",
    "it originally came as a surprise when the escape rate of uniformly hyperbolic systems was shown to be strongly dependent on the position of @xmath38 , allowing for the possibility of escape through some holes to be as fast as through holes which are twice as big @xcite .",
    "similar results were also observed in two dimensional billiard models @xcite ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this striking observation ( amongst others ) was originally proved in ref .",
    "@xcite for finite size holes in a large class of hyperbolic maps , later generalized and applied to the context of metastability in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that of diffusion in ref .",
    "significantly , for the open doubling map eq .   suggests that the local escape rate for each hole is @xmath64 , and since the number of aperiodic points ( i.e. irrational numbers ) is of full measure , almost every point in @xmath65 $ ] has a local escape rate equal to @xmath52 @xcite . indeed , eq .   which neglects the many local maxima where @xmath20 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : n56 ] ) would wrongfully suggest that the @xmath66 limit is approached from below since every finite sized hole contains a periodic orbit of finite period .",
    "it was however noted in @xcite that @xmath20 can occur when the shortest periodic orbit contained in a finite sized hole @xmath38 is maximal among all other possible holes of equal size .",
    "based on this observation , we will show here that for many holes and indeed for the average @xmath17 , the @xmath66 limit is in fact approached from above .    a commonly used and very useful estimate for @xmath11 is given by @xmath7 as in eq .",
    ", which is what ref .",
    "@xcite refers to as the `` naive '' estimate since it is equivalent to a binomial estimate for recurrence times in a purely random process and also to the escape rate in the presence of strong noise @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a connection can also be made with random maps .",
    "we briefly recall that a random map is a discrete time process in which one of @xmath31 maps is selected at random and applied separately at each time step @xcite .",
    "thus , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can define an average transfer matrix for open markov maps as @xmath67 , with probability weights @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding average escape rate is calculated from the leading eigenvalue of @xmath69 . for the open doubling map ( where @xmath70 ) , if all but one @xmath68 are equal to zero , then we are in the situation described previously with the escape rate being strongly position dependent .",
    "if however all transfer matrices are equally probable to occur then all @xmath71 , and @xmath72 where @xmath30 is the transfer matrix for the closed system .",
    "this case corresponds to _ partial _ leakage ( reflection coefficient equals to @xmath73 ) uniform in the phase space and so the escape rate  @xmath7 equals that of eq .",
    "with @xmath2 since @xmath30 is measure preserving and so has largest eigenvalue equal to @xmath52 .",
    "we are interested in the following natural question : _ if a markov hole is chosen at random , what escape rate should one expect ? _ or equivalently , _ what is the average of the curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n56 ] ? _",
    "we thus define this average for a markov map with @xmath31 possible hole positions as @xmath74 for the doubling map , all @xmath75 and therefore @xmath17 is just an arithmetic mean . in the limit of large @xmath23",
    "we have that @xmath17 converges to the size of the hole in agreement with both eqs .   and .",
    "it is the intention of this paper however to show that for a large class of markov maps this limit is actually approached from above rather than below .",
    "we do this by first deriving an exact periodic orbit formula for markov maps ( sec .",
    "[ ssec.pof ] ) which we then asymptotically expand to second order in hole size ( sec .",
    "[ ssec.sha ] ) .",
    "we then take the arithmetic mean of all @xmath15 escape rates and obtain an asymptotic expansion of @xmath17 ( sec .",
    "[ ssec.exp ] ) leading to the inequality for @xmath76 .",
    "thus the escape rate is typically faster than the expected naive estimate @xmath7 .",
    "as discussed above , the leading eigenvalue @xmath77 for the open doubling map is given by the solution of a polynomial equation , the characteristic equation of the transfer matrix @xmath78 . to make progress we need an explicit expression for this polynomial . while this has been discussed in a number of contexts , the form in which we express",
    "this , a new periodic orbit formula , is of interest in its own right .",
    "historically , this problem has been considered from the point of view of the waiting time distribution for finding a given fixed sequence @xmath79 of @xmath23 symbols in a sequence @xmath80 built drawing an independent identically distributed random variable , which has practical applications in computer search algorithms and dna sequence analysis . while similar expressions were stated as early as 1966  @xcite ,",
    "the most convenient starting point is thm 2.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite which gives ( using our notation ) the following recursion relation for the probability @xmath81 of stopping after exactly @xmath82 symbols : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is one if the first and last @xmath85 symbols of @xmath79 are identical , otherwise zero .",
    "since @xmath80 is constructed from independent random events ( e.g. a toss of coin ) , we expect @xmath86 to decay exponentially for large @xmath87 and therefore we assume that @xmath88 for any power @xmath89 .",
    "this assumption also reflects the exponentially decaying survival probability of strongly chaotic maps ( cf .",
    "where the mixing property of the dynamics causes the system to ` forget ' its initial state and therefore @xmath90 decays as a poisson process .",
    "moreover , since the @xmath86 are probabilities they sum to one .",
    "thus , by the use of the formula for a geometric series , the first two terms on the rhs become @xmath91 substituting this into eq .",
    ", writing @xmath92 in last sum on the rhs of eq .   and relabeling @xmath93 as @xmath94 , dividing everything by @xmath95 and then taking the limit @xmath96 we arrive at an exact formula @xmath97    we now connect this problem to the characteristic equation of the transfer matrix @xmath78 ( not restricted to the @xmath50 of the doubling map ) .",
    "first we notice that for each hole indexed by @xmath98 , there is a fixed point of the map @xmath99 .",
    "we then interpret the symbolic sequence @xmath100 of the periodic orbit associated to this fixed point as the symbolic sequence of the hole @xmath38 .",
    "significantly , in the case of the doubling map , @xmath100 is precisely the @xmath23-digit binary representation of the hole index @xmath16 .",
    "next we notice that @xmath101 used above indicates exactly the number ( zero or one ) of periodic points of length @xmath94 in the interval @xmath102 .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ eq.total ] ) can be written as @xmath103    for the doubling map with markov holes @xmath38 , all of size @xmath2 , eq .",
    "is exactly equal to the characteristic equation of @xmath50 multiplied by @xmath104 , and can be rearranged and expressed as @xmath105 where @xmath106 $ ] is the set of periods @xmath107 for periodic points in @xmath38 .",
    "we shall use this expression in the next subsection in order to obtain improved asymptotics in hole size formulas for the escape rate .",
    "a more compact and perhaps elegant version of expression can be obtained by noting that each period @xmath108 has exactly @xmath109 periodic points in the interval @xmath38 irrespective of the value of @xmath16 .",
    "thus we have a geometric series @xmath110 which converges for @xmath111 and has an analytic continuation at all complex @xmath112 .",
    "we combine eq . with the finite sum of short periodic orbits in eq . to construct a function @xmath113 which can likewise be uniquely defined for all @xmath112 by analytic continuation .",
    "thus we come to our first main result : _ for the doubling map with a markov hole @xmath38 , we have that @xmath114 .",
    "_    note that eq .",
    "differs from other periodic expansions in the literature  @xcite in that it enumerates periodic points in the hole rather than periodic orbits that avoid it ( see also  @xcite ) , the sum is over all periodic points at all periods , and it is always divergent ( i.e. requires analytic continuation for its definition ) . as with similar number - theoretic and dynamical zeta functions ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it has the paradoxical property that the ( correctly interpreted ) sum of a positive divergent series is zero .",
    "the derivation naturally generalizes to markov maps with more than two full branches , including where each branch has a different expansion factor ( i.e. skewed maps ) ; here the factor @xmath115 is replaced by the expansion factor of the relevant periodic orbit .",
    "we emphasize that this periodic orbit formula is exact , and applies to markov holes of all sizes .",
    "we now expand the escape rate in powers of the hole size @xmath19 ; as can be seen from a similar calculation  @xcite this can be useful whether or not the function is smooth .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite we need to allow the coefficients to contain polynomial functions of @xmath116 .",
    "we write @xmath117 , so that the small hole expansion for the corresponding eigenvalue is of the form @xmath118 up to second order such that @xmath119 and @xmath120 . substituting these into eq .",

    "we now make the important observation , that each markov hole may be one of two types .",

    "in particular , the maximal escape rates appear in type b holes and the number of such holes is given by the integer sequence  @xcite @xmath132 which refers to the number of `` bifix - free '' words of length @xmath23 over a two - letter alphabet and increases like @xmath133 .",

    "we have shown however that the sheer number of holes with @xmath267 , in contrast to the much fewer but much more pronounced holes with @xmath268 , is what effectively causes the inequality @xmath269 , with equality only in the limit @xmath270 .",

    "we have also performed numerical simulations in the chaotic diamond billiard , which is beyond the class of systems investigated here as there is no finite markov partition of the phase space .",
