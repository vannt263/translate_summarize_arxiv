    "the method for calculating masses and wave functions of heavy quarkonia that is reported here stems from the program of a weak - coupling expansion for hamiltonians in light - front ( lf ) qcd@xcite .",
    "the lf form of dynamics was discovered by dirac@xcite and continues to excite imagination of physicists@xcite .",
    "many authors have rediscovered lf dynamics . a famous example concerns application to hard exclusive processes@xcite .",
    "review articles provide other references concerning lf formalism@xcite .",
    "one reason of the great interest is that the field quantization on the front hyperplane leads to 7 kinematical generators of the poincar group , instead of only 6 kinematical generators in the standard form ( 3 momentum and 3 angular momentum operators ) .",
    "another reason is that the vacuum problem in the lf formulation of quantum field theory appears intriguingly different from the standard version .",
    "the same two reasons propelled also the development of the renormalization group procedure for effective particles ( rgpep ) that is the basis of the method discussed here@xcite .",
    "but there are two more reasons .",
    "the first is that the lf fock space of free bare particles can be introduced before one constructs the concept of a quantum field operator and builds hamiltonian interaction terms for the bare quanta using such field operators@xcite .",
    "this is useful when one attempts to mathematically define a theory of quarks and gluons that never appear as incoming or outgoing particles in scattering experiments but exist inside hadrons .",
    "proceeding in this order , one can regulate the interaction terms in the lf hamiltonian in a boost - invariant way .",
    "the regularization is accomplished using the relative transverse momenta and fractions of total `` plus '' momentum that the bare particles in interaction are carrying@xcite .",
    "the transverse and `` plus '' momenta are defined with respect to the direction of the front hyperplane , the latter conventionally defined by the condition @xmath0 in a frame of reference in which the front is moving along @xmath1-axis ( @xmath2 ) , extending in the transverse directions of coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "the transverse momenta of the particles are denoted by @xmath4 and their `` plus '' momenta by @xmath5 .",
    "the regulated interaction hamiltonian for bare particles is invariant with respect to boosts along the @xmath1-axis and two additional boost - like transformations that can change transverse momenta to arbitrary values .",
    "it is also invariant with respect to two translations in the @xmath6 directions , translation in the @xmath7 direction , and rotations around the @xmath1-axis ( typically directed along the beam , a dominant momentum transfer , or a suitable combination thereof depending on a scattering experiment , but in a complete theory the choice should not matter ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian has the same structure in a large class of frames of reference ( 7 dimensional ) .",
    "consequently , one does not need to construct hamiltonian counterterms that restore boost symmetry when one tries to quantitatively explain the mechanism by which masses , spins , and other quantum numbers of hadrons are formed .",
    "most attractively , the basic hamiltonian has the same structure in the rest frame of a hadron , where the constituent picture works@xcite , and in the infinite momentum frame , where the parton model works@xcite .",
    "the lf hamiltonian approach raises hopes for conceptual and quantitative explanation of the constituent and parton models in a single and complete formulation of qcd .",
    "the second reason is that one can take advantage of the concept of potentials acting at a distance between relativistic quarks and gluons , a feast not conceivable in the standard approach that is defined using objects distributed on a space - like hyperplane in space - time .",
    "every interaction between two objects located at different points of such a hyperplane corresponds to a dynamical effect spreading faster than light and has to eventually cancel out in observables ( this happens in perturbative qed but it is not clear how it may happen in non - perturbative qcd ) .",
    "therefore , it is common in the standard approach to consider only action and use local lagrangian densities for field variables in a path - integral formula for transition amplitudes .",
    "geometrical ideas such as strings and other nonlocal objects in multidimensional spaces are then used to regulate and explain the interaction terms in the lagrangians . an additional argument for the lagrangian approach",
    "is that it can incorporate variation of the metric in space - time and , hopefully , illuminate the problem of connection between particle dynamics and gravity@xcite .",
    "but if one leaves gravity aside as too weak to be of an immediate concern at the scale of hadronic binding mechanism , it is useful to observe that the lf hamiltonian at @xmath8 can contain potential terms that act between particles separated by arbitrarily large distances and such interactions can obey the rule that dynamical effects do not spread faster than light .",
    "namely , when the bare point - like particles have the same transverse positions , the four - dimensional space - time interval between them is zero no matter how large is their separation in the direction of @xmath7 . in fact , the lf counterpart of the coulomb interaction between two particles 1 and 2 on the lf is proportional to @xmath9 when @xmath10 , and otherwise vanishes .",
    "precisely this type of interaction leads to a model of confinement in a 1 + 1 dimensional theory@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the lf hamiltonians are very singular when transverse distances between charged point - like particles tend to zero , and the singular terms can involve entire functions of the @xmath7 distances between the particles .    both reasons described above indicate that one needs a powerful ultraviolet renormalization technique for hamiltonians in order to develop lf qcd ( note that the wilsonian concept of universality could help in identifying effective hamiltonians irrespectively of many details in setting up the initial bare theory ) .",
    "a new technique has been invented@xcite and adopted in a general scheme of weak coupling expansion in lf qcd@xcite .",
    "more recently , the hamiltonian approach has been redesigned in the form of rgpep@xcite .",
    "the results reported below are obtained using rgpep and an ansatz for a mass - gap for gluons .",
    "since there is not enough room here to thoroughly explain the rgpep in application to heavy quarkonia@xcite in comparison to other approaches , only the main steps are indicated .",
    "the central puzzle is how a systematic treatment of qcd can produce binding of quarks above threshold .",
    "qed describes quantum binding only below the mass threshold .",
    "so , how can binding above the threshold emerge in a relativistic quantum theory ?",
    "one begins from the lagrangian for qcd with one flavor of quarks @xmath11 a canonical lf procedure in gauge @xmath12 produces a hamiltonian with many terms ( constraint equations are solved explicitly)@xcite @xmath13 ^ 2 } + h_{[\\partial a a](\\psi\\psi ) }   \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each of these terms is an integral of the corresponding hamiltonian density over the lf hyperplane with @xmath8 , @xmath14 . for example , @xmath15 the fields at @xmath16 are expanded into creation and annihilation operators for bare quarks and gluons , the measure is @xmath17 = dk^+ d^2k^\\perp /(16 \\pi^3 k^+)$ ] : @xmath18 \\left [ \\chi_c u_{k\\sigma } b_{k\\sigma c } e^{-ikx } + \\chi_c v_{k\\sigma } d^\\dagger_{k\\sigma c } e^{ikx } \\right ] \\",
    ", ,   \\\\ \\label{a }   a^\\mu = \\sum_{\\sigma c } \\int [ k ] \\left [ t^c \\varepsilon^\\mu_{k\\sigma } a_{k\\sigma c } e^{-ikx } + t^c \\varepsilon^{\\mu * } _ { k\\sigma } a^\\dagger_{k\\sigma c } e^{ikx}\\right ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath19 stands for color , @xmath20 for spin .",
    "the bilinear terms in @xmath21 provide kinetic energies for the bare particles and the terms with more than two fields provide interactions that are regulated@xcite as indicated in section [ motivation ] .",
    "the regularization implies appearance of counterterms , @xmath22 , that restore the dynamics that was cut off by the regularization .",
    "the full regulated hamiltonian , @xmath23_{reg}$ ] provides the initial condition for rgpep ( rgpep is also used to determine @xmath22)@xcite .",
    "the main step is to replace the canonical operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , or their hermitean conjugates in eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ a ] ) , commonly denoted by @xmath27 , by unitarily equivalent operators that create or annihilate effective particles corresponding to the renormalization group parameter @xmath28 , @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 . given the initial condition @xmath33_{reg}$ ] , one can systematically evaluate the hamiltonian @xmath34 $ ] in perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath35 is equal to @xmath36 but it is expressed in terms of operators creating and annihilating effective particles of size @xmath37 with respect to strong interactions . since @xmath35 is expressed in terms of the creation and annihilation operators for effective quarks and gluons instead of the bare canonical ones , it contains different interaction terms , including new effective potentials . for @xmath28 on the order of hadronic masses , the effective particles are expected to correspond to the constituent quarks and gluons that are used to describe hadrons in particle tables@xcite . the perturbative procedure for evaluating @xmath35 is safe from genuine infrared singularities because the rgpep generator @xmath38 is designed to exclude the possibility that energy denominators in perturbation theory are significantly smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue equation for quarkonium wave function can be solved numerically and the mass spectrum depends on the choice of the coupling constant @xmath57 and quark mass @xmath69 at some value of @xmath28 .",
    "the breit - fermi terms include three - dimensional @xmath70-functions that are smeared and made finite by the presence of the form factors @xmath49 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath71 , the rgpep evolution with one flavor of quarks in the same hamiltonian scheme@xcite gives @xmath72 at @xmath73 gev .",
    "table [ table ] shows masses of @xmath74 quarkonia obtained for @xmath57 = 0.326 and @xmath69 = 4857 mev at @xmath28 = 3699 mev , adjusted to fit masses of @xmath75(1p ) and @xmath75(2p ) .",
    "the pattern of differences in the 4th column agrees with expectations in the new scheme .",
    "all details concerning this calculation and results for some other quarkonia can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the oscillator frequency corresponding to table [ table ] is @xmath76 = 182 mev .",
    "the bottom line is that the realistic value of @xmath57 is near 1/3 and the new hamiltonian approach to qcd can be further studied in a weak coupling expansion in the case of heavy quarkonia , including many effects in the complex relativistic color dynamics of virtual quarks and gluons .",
