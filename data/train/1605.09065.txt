    "<S> * orthorhombic mote@xmath0 and its isostructural compound wte@xmath0 were recently claimed to belong to a new class ( type ii ) of weyl semi - metals @xcite characterized by a linear touching between hole and electron fermi surfaces in addition to nodal lines@xcite . to validate these predictions , we synthesized high quality single - crystals of @xmath1-mote@xmath0 , finding that its superconducting transition temperature@xcite depends on disorder as quantified by the ratio between the room- and low - temperature resistivities . </S>",
    "<S> similar to wte@xmath0 , its magnetoresistivity does not saturate at high magnetic fields@xcite and can easily surpass @xmath2 % , with the superimposed shubnikov de haas oscillations revealing a non - trivial berry phase of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of the fermi surface , as extracted from the quantum oscillations , is markedly distinct from the calculated one@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a broad anomaly seen in the heat capacity and in the hall - effect indicates that the crystallographic and the electronic structures evolve upon cooling below 100 k , likely explaining the discrepancy between these recent predictions and our experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> *    transition - metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) belonging to the orthorhombic and non - centrosymmetric @xmath4 space group were recently claimed to be characterized by a non - trivial @xmath5 topological invariant based on the parity of their valence bands , making them good candidates for a quantum spin hall insulating ground - state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this state is characterized by helical edge states that are protected by time - reversal symmetry from both localization and elastic backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> hence , these compounds would provide a platform for realizing low dissipation quantum electronics and spintronics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the majority of gapped tmds such as semiconducting mos@xmath0 or wse@xmath0 , crystallize either in a trigonal prismatic coordination or in a triclinic one @xcite as res@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> those crystallizing in the aforementioned orthorhombic phase , e.g. wte@xmath0 , are in fact semi - metals albeit displaying anomalous transport properties such as an enormous non - saturating magnetoresistivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , strain is predicted to open a band gap @xcite in wte@xmath0 which would make it suitable for device development . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , simple exfoliation of its isostructural mote@xmath0 compound into thin atomic layers is claimed to induce a band gap @xcite in absence of strain . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition would contrast with band structure calculation predictions which find that it should remain semi - metallic when exfoliated down to a single atomic layer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the insulating behavior reported for a few atomic layers of wte@xmath0 was ascribed to an increase in disorder due to its chemical instability in the presence of humidity which is claimed to induce anderson localization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , motivated by the scientific relevance and the technological implications of the aforementioned theoretical predictions @xcite we evaluate , through electrical transport and torque magnetometry , the topological nature , the superconducting properties , and the electronic structure at the fermi level of bulk single - crystals of orthorhombic mote@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to contrast our experimental findings to the theoretical expectations and to provide relevant information that would help us predict the physical properties of heterostructures fabricated from single- or few atomic layers of this compound . </S>",
    "<S> an agreement between the calculated geometry of the fermi surface of mote@xmath0 with the one extracted from quantum oscillatory phenomena , would support the existence of weyl nodes in the bulk@xcite , and provide evidence for the existence of related non - trivial topological surface states , e.g. fermi arcs @xcite , in single or few - atomic layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed fermi surface differs considerably from the calculated one , indicating that these predictions should be revisited once the low temperature crystallographic structure of mote@xmath0 is determined .        </S>",
    "<S> very high quality single crystals of monoclinic @xmath6mote@xmath0 were synthesized through a te flux method as described in methods . as illustrated by fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1**a * * , the  as synthesized \" single - crystals display resistivity ratios _ rrr _ = @xmath7 ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 which is between one and two orders of magnitude higher than @xmath10 values currently available in the literature ( see , for example , ref . ) . </S>",
    "<S> although not clearly visible in fig . 1**a * * due to its logarithmic scale , a hysteretic anomaly is observed in the resistivity around @xmath11 k which corresponds to the monoclinic to orthorhombic structural transition which stabilizes what we denominate as the @xmath12mote@xmath0 phase ( also referred to as the @xmath13 phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> these single - crystals were subsequently measured at much lower temperatures in order to determine their superconducting transition temperatures @xmath14 . remarkably , and as seen in fig . 1**b * * , we find that @xmath14 depends on sample quality , increasing considerably as the @xmath10 increases , suggesting that structural disorder suppresses @xmath14 . for these measurements , </S>",
    "<S> particular care was taken to suppress the remanent field of the superconducting magnet since the upper critical fields are rather small , see supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1 . the sample displaying the highest @xmath10 and concomitant @xmath14 was measured in absence of a remanent field . to verify that these differences in @xmath14 are not due to a poor thermal coupling between the sample and the thermometers , @xmath14 was measured twice by increasing and decreasing @xmath15 very slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the observed hysteresis is small relative to @xmath14 indicating that the measured @xmath14s are not an artifact . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the residual resistivities @xmath16 depend on a careful determination of the geometrical factors such as the size of the electrical contacts . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath10 provide a more accurate determination of the single - crystalline quality . in the past , </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of @xmath14 by impurities and structural defects was systematically taken as evidence for unconventional superconductivity @xcite , e.g. triplet superconductivity @xcite in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 1**c * * and 1**d * * display the change in magnetoresistivity @xmath18 as a function of the field @xmath19 for a crystal characterized by @xmath20 when the electrical current flows along the crystalline _ a_-axis and the field is applied either along the _ c_- or the _ b_-axes , respectively . similarly to wte@xmath0 , for both orientations @xmath21 shows no sign of saturation under fields all the way up to 60 t while surpassing @xmath22 % for @xmath23-axis @xcite . for wte@xmath0 such anomalous magnetoresistivity was attributed to compensation between the density of electrons and holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , there are a number of subsequent observations@xcite contradicting this simple scenario such as i ) a non - linear hall response @xcite , ii ) the suppression of the magnetoresistivity at a pressure where the hall response vanishes@xcite ( i.e. at perfect compensation ) and iii ) the observation of a pronounced magnetoresistivity in electrolyte gated samples with a considerably higher density of electrons with respect to that of holes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains unclear if the proposed unconventional electronic structure @xcite would play any role on the giant magnetoresistivity of wte@xmath0 , but its measured fermi surface differs considerably from the calculated one @xcite .    the best samples , i.e. those with @xmath24 , display even more pronounced @xmath25 under just @xmath26 t. the oscillatory component superimposed on the magnetoresistivity corresponds to the shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect resulting from the landau quantization of the electronic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1**e * * shows the oscillatory , or the sdh signal as a function of inverse field @xmath27 for three temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the sdh signal was obtained by fitting the background signal to a polynomial and then by subtracting it . </S>",
    "<S> notice how for this sample and for this orientation the sdh signal is dominated by a single frequency which is convenient for plotting the landau index @xmath28 as a function of @xmath27 as displayed in fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1**f * * , the linear extrapolation of @xmath28 as a function @xmath19 leads to @xmath56 since the factor of @xmath57 ( or @xmath58 ) reflects the fact that the minima in @xmath59 ( maxima in @xmath36 ) correspond to filled landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> as we discuss below , and in contrast to band structure calculations , our study on the fermi surfaces ( fs ) of @xmath12mote@xmath0 based upon quantum oscillatory phenomena indicates that all of its fermi surfaces are three - dimensional in character . </S>",
    "<S> hence , @xmath60 which leads to @xmath61 or @xmath62 , or to non - trivial values . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our study provides evidence for the topological nature of this compound .        </S>",
    "<S> given the enormous , non - saturating magnetoresistance displayed by @xmath12mote@xmath0 , which could be ascribed to nearly perfect electron - hole compensation @xcite as for wte@xmath0 , we proceed by studying its density of electron and holes through hall - effect measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our detailed , two - band analysis of the hall response of @xmath12mote@xmath0 will be published elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hall - effect yields two important observations : i ) two anomalies in its temperature dependence ( measured under @xmath63 t ) , as seen in fig . 2**a * * , the first associated with the monoclinic to orthorhombic transition ( indicated by brown arrow ) and the second yielding a sharp increase in the hall constant below @xmath64 k ( blue arrow ) which ii ) leads to a very sharp increase in the density holes and makes the system almost perfectly compensated below @xmath65 k , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2**b**. in fact , at low temperatures the hall resistivity is basically linear all the way up to @xmath66 9 t indicating that @xmath12mote@xmath0 is better compensated than wte@xmath0 , see e.g. ref . . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp increase in the hall constant at lower @xmath15s is suggestive of an electronic phase - transition akin to the temperature - dependent lifshitz - transition @xcite reported for wte@xmath0 . to evaluate this hypothesis , we performed heat capacity measurements in a @xmath67mote@xmath0 single - crystal . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2**c * * displays the specific heat @xmath45 , normalized by the temperature and as a function of @xmath15 in a logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 displays a broad anomaly around @xmath68 k roughly at the same @xmath15 where one observes a sharp increase in the hall - constant . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation to @xmath69 k yields a sizeable electronic contribution term @xmath70 mj / molk@xmath51 , a surprising value for a semi - metal characterized by a relatively small density of carriers . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , metallic copper yields @xmath71 mj / molk@xmath51 . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , the large @xmath72 suggests a relatively high density of states at the fermi level which is consistent with the observation of superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the broad anomaly can not be reconciled with either a first- or a second - order phase - transition . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it suggests a crossover between two regimes , and since it occurs at temperatures where @xmath49 is dominated by phonons , it indicates the involvement of lattice degrees of freedom or that the crystallographic structure evolves upon cooling below @xmath73 k. the hall - effect , on the other hand , indicates that the electronic structure is deeply affected by the evolution of the lattice upon cooling .    since the hall - effect points towards an evolution of the electronic structure upon cooling below 100 k , it is pertinent to ask if it considerably affects the geometry of the fermi surface , which is the departing point of the predictions in refs . . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3**a * * and 3**b * * display both the de haas van alphen ( dhva , red traces ) and the sdh signals ( black traces ) measured in two distinct single crystals and for two field orientations , respectively along the @xmath35 and the @xmath74axes . as previously indicated , the dhva and sdh signals were obtained after fitting a polynomial and subtracting it from the background magnetic torque and magnetoresistivity traces . </S>",
    "<S> the sdh signal was collected from a crystal displaying a @xmath75 at @xmath76 mk under fields up to 18 t , while the dhva one was obtained from a crystal displaying @xmath77 at @xmath78 mk under fields up to 35 t. both panels also display the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the oscillatory signal . </S>",
    "<S> the onsager relation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the planck constant and @xmath81 is the electron charge , relates the observed frequencies to the extremal cross - sectional areas @xmath82 of the fermi surface . for fields along the @xmath35axis , </S>",
    "<S> one observes two main peaks at @xmath83 t and at @xmath84 t , as well as their first- and second harmonics and perhaps some rather small frequencies which could result from imperfect background subtraction . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the same two dominant frequencies regardless of the interval in @xmath85 used to extract the ffts .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of just two main frequencies is rather surprising since , as we discuss below , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , including the effect of the spin - orbit interaction performed with either the wien2k or the the vasp implementation , predict several pairs of electron - like corrugated cylindrical fermi surfaces ( fs ) along with pairs of smaller three - dimensional electron - like sheets in the first - brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , around the @xmath86point dft predicts at least a pair of four - fold symmetric helix - like large hole sheets . </S>",
    "<S> this complex fermi surface should lead to a quite rich oscillatory signal , contrary to what is seen . </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that the non - observation of all of the predicted fs sheets would be attributable to experimental lack of sensitivity or to poor sample quality which would lead to low carrier mobility . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our analysis of the hall - effect within a two - carrier model , yields electron- and hole - mobilities ranging between @xmath87 and @xmath88 cm@xmath51/vs at low @xmath15s which is consistent with both the small residual resistivities and the large resistivity ratios of the measured crystals . </S>",
    "<S> given that the magnetic torque is particularly sensitive to the anisotropy of the fs , such high mobilities would have allowed us to detect the predicted fss , particularly at the very low @xmath15s used for the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we conclude that the geometry of the fermi surface must differ considerably from the one predicted by dft .    in figs . 3**c * * and 3**d * * we plot the amplitude of the main peaks observed in the fft spectra for fields along the @xmath35axis as a function of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> red lines are fits to the lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) temperature damping factor , i.e. @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 the effective mass in units of the free electron mass , from which we extract the effective masses associated to each frequency . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , for @xmath93axis one obtains @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which contrasts with the respective values obtained for @xmath96axis , namely @xmath97 , see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3**e * * and 3**f**. therefore , @xmath12mote@xmath0 displays a sizeable anisotropy in effective masses . </S>",
    "<S> a similar anisotropy is observed in wte@xmath0 although with a factor of @xmath98 lighter effective masses@xcite . for the sake of completeness , </S>",

    "<S> s2 displays the dhva signal for @xmath99 aligned nearly along the @xmath100axis along with the corresponding fft spectra . for this orientation </S>",
    "<S> we observe again two main frequencies , but by reducing the @xmath85 window to focus on the higher field region , we detect additional frequencies which are characterized by much heavier effective masses , i.e. in the order of @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that @xmath12mote@xmath0 displays a higher anisotropy in effective masses when compared to wte@xmath0 , although these masses are consistent with the sizeable @xmath72 coefficient , suggesting that this system might be characterized by electronic correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> several recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies @xcite claim to find a broad agreement between band structure calculations , predicted geometry of the fermi surface , concomitant existence of weyl type ii points @xcite , and related fermi arcs on the surface states of @xmath12mote@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> several of these experimental and theoretical studies claim that the electronic structure of this compound is particularly sensitive to its precise crystallographic structure . </S>",
    "<S> inter - growth of the @xmath102 phase or the temperature used to collect to @xmath103ray diffraction data , typically around 100 to 230 k , are claimed to have a considerable effect on the calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given the few frequencies observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 it is , therefore , pertinent to ask if the broad anomaly observed in the heat capacity around @xmath104 k affects the structural degrees of freedom , as well as the brillouin zone and the geometry of the fermi surface . to address this question we performed a detailed angular - dependent study of the frequencies extracted from both the sdh and the dhva effects in @xmath12mote@xmath0 in order to compare with the angular dependence of the fs cross - sectional areas predicted by the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to arpes , which is a surface sensitive technique that depends upon momentum matrix elements , the magnitude of the scattering cross sections , as well as the energy and polarization of the incident light , the de haas - van - alphen - effect is a bulk , thermodynamic measurement which relies solely on the purity of the measured single crystals .    </S>",

    "<S> the resulting four - fold symmetric so split hole - like fs around the @xmath86point , labeled as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , are depicted in blue . </S>",
    "<S> dft predicts two sets of so - split electron sheets with  crescent \"- like cross sections at either side of the @xmath86point as well as other two sets of so - split surfaces around the @xmath103point having elliptical cross - sections . </S>",
    "<S> we will label each sub - set of so - split electron fss as the @xmath107 and @xmath108 surfaces , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the corrugation of the @xmath107 and @xmath108 surfaces leads to two extremal cross - sectional areas , i.e.  neck \" and  belly \" orbits . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , dft predicts additional sets of small , closed so - split electron like fss with diamond- and ellipsoidal - like geometries , which we label as the @xmath109 and @xmath110 surfaces , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4**b * * plots the extreme fs cross - sectional areas that would be observed by quantum oscillatory phenomena when the field is rotated within the @xmath111 and @xmath112 planes . in this plot </S>",

    "<S> @xmath113 refers to angles between the @xmath35 and the @xmath74axis , where @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath115axis , while @xmath116 corresponds to angles between the @xmath35 and the @xmath100axis , again relative to the @xmath35axis . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , all closed electron orbits , namely @xmath109 and @xmath110 , should yield frequencies well below 100 t , while the open ones that is @xmath107 and @xmath108 , should yield frequencies ranging from 200 to 400 t for angles close to the @xmath117-axis . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath107 and @xmath108 are open fs sheets , for angles beyond @xmath118 their related orbits diverge as one approaches either the @xmath74 or the @xmath100axis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath105 and @xmath106 should yield frequencies in excess of 1 kt for @xmath119axis , which decrease to values ranging between 0.5 and 0.85 kt for fields along the other two axes . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4**c * * displays the fft spectra of the dhva signal ( see the oscillatory signal in the supplementary fig . </S>",
    "<S> s6 ) as a function of the cyclotron frequency @xmath31 . as previously discussed , for @xmath115axis the fft spectra is dominated by a double peak structure centred around 250 t which is in the range of frequencies predicted for the orbits on the @xmath107 and @xmath108 surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> one also detects its first and second harmonics and an additional small frequency around 30 t which is close to the frequencies predicted for the small electron - like ellipsoids on the @xmath109 and @xmath110 surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the field is rotated towards either the @xmath74 or the @xmath100axis , it splits into multiple peak structures yielding finite frequencies along both axes . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates unambiguously that the related fermi surfaces are closed , or three - dimensional in character , in sharp contrast to the dft calculations . </S>",

    "<S> the geometry of the observed fs sheets of @xmath12mote@xmath0 can not , on the other hand , be described by ellipsoids . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , quantum oscillatory phenomena indicates that one should be careful concerning the claims of a broad agreement between the calculations and the arpes measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively ascribe the discrepancy between calculated and experimentally detected fermi surfaces to the evolution of the crystallographic structure of @xmath12mote@xmath0 upon cooling below 100 k as indicated by the heat capacity . </S>",
    "<S> the correct determination of its low temperature crystallographic and concomitant electronic structures is of paramount importance for correctly describing its topological properties . </S>",
