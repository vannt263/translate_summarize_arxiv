    "the experimental progress in controlling quantum optical and atomic systems , which has been achieved over the last few years , prompted ideas for new realizations of strongly correlated many body systems , such as ultracold gases of atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite or light - matter systems.@xcite the latter consist of photons , which interact with atoms or atomiclike structures .",
    "normally , the interaction between photons and atoms is very weak , since the interaction time is small .",
    "however , a strong interaction can be achieved when photons are confined within optical cavities . in this case",
    ", the coupling between photons and atoms leads to an effective repulsion between photons , which means that it costs energy to add additional photons to the cavity .",
    "the arrangement of such cavities on a lattice , see fig.[fig : intcav ] , allows the photons to `` hop '' between neighboring sites , provided the cavities are coupled .",
    "quantum mechanically the coupling of adjacent cavities means that their photonic wave functions overlap . due to the strong interaction between photons and atoms , and the introduction of a lattice of coupled cavities , a strongly correlated phase emerges where photons are present .",
    "the light - matter models share some basic properties with the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model , @xcite such as the quantum phase transition from a mott phase , where particles are localized on the lattice sites , to a superfluid phase , where particles are delocalized on the whole lattice . @xcite yet the physics of the light - matter models is far richer because two distinct particles , namely , photons and atomiclike excitations , are present .",
    "a major advantage of these man - made realizations of strongly correlated many - body systems is that they can be tailored to correspond to a many - body model , whose parameters can be directly controlled in the experiment .",
    "furthermore local quantities , such as the particle density at a specific lattice site , can be addressed individually due to the mesoscopic scale of the cavities and both lattice size and geometry can be controlled in the fabrication process .",
    "an experimental realization of these light - matter systems is still missing but there are several promising approaches , such as photonic crystal cavities or toroidal and disk - shaped cavities .",
    "@xcite if light - matter systems can be realized , they will undoubtedly provide fascinating insight in the physics of strongly correlated many - body systems .",
    "the realizations might be used as quantum simulators for other quantum mechanical problems or even more intriguing for quantum information processing applications.@xcite    recently , there has been a lot of research activity in the field of light - matter systems .",
    "most of the work has been devoted to investigate the quantum phase transition from the mott to the superfluid phase .",
    "some basic characteristics of the quantum phase transition have been evaluated from small systems of a few cavities by means of exact diagonalization.@xcite results are available at mean - field level @xcite as well or more accurately from analytical strong coupling perturbation theory calculations,@xcite and from simulations based on the density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) , the variational cluster approach@xcite and quantum monte carlo.@xcite spectral properties of light - matter systems have been investigated in refs .",

    ", we study in detail the spectral properties of a one - dimensional light - matter system .",
    "in particular , we evaluate both photonic as well as atomic - excitation spectral functions .",
    "the investigation of both spectral functions allows us to characterize the polariton excitations in light - matter models .",
    "in addition to the spectral functions , we present densities of states , momentum distributions and spatial correlation functions . for completeness",
    "we also show the first two lobes delimiting the mott transition .",

    "from the great variety of possible theoretical descriptions of light - matter systems @xcite we concentrate on the simplest one , which consists of an array of cavities each of which contains a two - level system.@xcite the physics of the @xmath0-th cavity can be described by the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian , @xcite which for @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the resonance frequency of the cavity , i.e. , the frequency of the confined photons , @xmath4 is the energy spacing of the two - level system , and @xmath5 is the atom - field coupling constant .",
    "the operator @xmath6 creates a photon with frequency @xmath3 , whereas @xmath7 annihilates one .",
    "the two - level system can be mathematically described by pauli spin algebra .",
    "thus , we identify the ground state of the two - level system with @xmath8 and the excited state with @xmath9 . with",
    "that the atomic raising operator is defined as @xmath10 and the atomic lowering operator as @xmath11 , respectively . in order to obtain the jc hamiltonian",
    "the rotating wave approximation , which is justified for @xmath12,@xcite has been assumed .",
    "the deviation between the resonance frequency and the energy spacing of the two - level system , @xmath13 , is termed detuning . for the jc hamiltonian the particle number",
    "@xmath14 is a conserved quantity , as @xmath15 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the rotating wave approximation.@xcite    the full model consists of an array of @xmath16 cavities , which form a lattice and hence we refer to this model as the jaynes - cummings lattice ( jcl ) model . due to the coupling of the cavities",
    ", photons are allowed to hop between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "this leads to the jcl hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hopping strength and @xmath19 the chemical potential , which controls the total particle number @xmath20 of the system .",
    "the first sum with the angle brackets around the summation indices is restricted to nearest - neighbor sites . in the case of the jcl model ,",
    "the particle number of a specific cavity @xmath21 is not conserved anymore . however , the total particle number @xmath22 is a conserved quantity . in summary ,",
    "the jcl hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath23 from eq.([eq : spe : jclrewritten ] ) and from the fact that we consider the coupling strength @xmath5 as unit of energy , it follows that the physics only depends on three independent parameters , namely the hopping strength @xmath18 , the detuning @xmath24 and the modified chemical potential @xmath25 . in order to fulfill the condition for the rotating wave approximation the resonance frequency @xmath3 has to be large in comparison with the detuning @xmath24 , which can be always satisfied theoretically as solely the difference between the chemical potential and the resonance frequency appears in the grand - canonical hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "in order to investigate the properties of the jcl model , we use the variational cluster approach @xcite ( vca ) , which has been formulated for bosonic systems in ref .  .",
    "previous work on the jcl model within vca was carried out in ref .  .",
    "the basic concept of vca is that the grand potential @xmath27 is expressed as a functional of the self - energy @xmath28 and that dyson s equation for the exact green s function @xmath29 is recovered at the stationary point of the self - energy functional @xmath30$].@xcite in order to evaluate @xmath30 $ ] , the self - energy @xmath28 of the investigated system is approximated by the self - energy of an exactly solvable , so - called reference , system . in practice",
    ", this means that the self - energy @xmath28 becomes a function of the set @xmath31 of single - particle parameters of the reference system , i.e. , @xmath32 . for bosonic systems",
    "the approximated grand potential reads@xcite @xmath33 where primed quantities correspond to the reference system and @xmath34 is the noninteracting green s function .",
    "the stationary condition on @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 this condition can be evaluated numerically by varying some or all of the single - particle parameters . in order to guarantee that a given physical quantity ( such as the number of particles ) is thermodynamically consistent , it is necessary that @xmath27 is stationary with respect to the associated coupling constant ( here the chemical potential).@xcite therefore , varying @xmath3 ensures that the total number of photons is thermodynamically consistent . on the other hand , it would be advisable for a conserved quantity , i.e. , @xmath20 to be consistent as well .",
    "otherwise uncommon situations could occur .",
    "for example , as we show below , the total particle density @xmath37 , evaluated as a trace of the green s functions is not integer in the mott phase .",
    "this effect becomes stronger close to the tip of the mott lobe , see fig.[fig : comparison ] .",
    "the noninteger particle density , occurring when @xmath19 is not taken as a variational parameter , clearly introduces an uncertainty in the determination of the phase boundary .    in principle , however , there is a formal difficulty in taking @xmath19 as a variational parameter .",
    "the problem is related to the coupling of @xmath19 with atomic excitations , which , in contrast to photons , can not be seen as noninteracting particles .",
    "this is , in general , not allowed within vca , whereby the reference system can differ from the physical one by a single - particle hamiltonian only .",
    "the solution is readily overcome by observing that the two - level atomic system can be mapped onto a hard - core boson model . in this way , @xmath19 couples to the total number of `` atomic '' bosons plus photons , i.e. , a noninteracting hamiltonian .",
    "the hard - core constraint simply becomes a local ( in principle infinite ) interaction , which is common to the reference and to the physical system .",
    "the mapping of the two - level excitations onto hard - core bosons is mathematically achieved by the following replacements @xmath38 this is valid provided one excludes states with double occupation of @xmath39 particles _ even as intermediate states_.@xcite with this mapping the jcl hamiltonian reads @xmath40 where we have formally implemented the hard - core constraint by introducing an infinite interaction for @xmath39 particles . in the restricted hilbert space of zero or one hard - core boson per lattice site , the matrix elements of the two representations are identical . in principle , states with higher occupation number @xmath41 have to be considered in the bosonic version as well .",
    "however , the occupation of such states would cost infinite energy and , therefore , they do not influence the energies obtained from the hilbert space sector with occupation numbers @xmath42.@xcite we have checked this aspect numerically for very large @xmath43 .",
    "it can also be verified easily when the sector of the hilbert space with @xmath44 is included perturbatively .",
    "these considerations can be straightforwardly extended to light - matter models with more than one atom or atomiclike structure ( with two relevant levels ) per cavity . in this case , one introduces a boson species for each atom and the hard - core constraint is enforced for each boson species .    in our calculation",
    "we take both parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the reference system as variational parameters ( @xmath19 is just a linear combination ) , which ensures thermodynamic consistency for the particle number of both species , and , consequently , of the total particle number .",
    "we show below , that varying both parameters instead of just @xmath3 provides an improvement in the accuracy of the phase boundaries for a given cluster size , see tab.[tab : spe : quality ] .",
    "the present formulation of the vca can not address the superfluid phase , and is , thus , restricted to the mott phase.@xcite outside of the mott lobes , peaks with negative ( positive ) spectral weight appear in the positive ( negative ) @xmath45 region , signaling the instability towards the superfluid phase .",
    "a treatment of the superfluid phase requires a nambu green s function treatment analogous to the fermionic case .",
    "the boundary of the mott phase could be , in principle , determined by this criterion .",
    "however , it is simpler ( and , of course , equivalent ) to identify it , for a given @xmath18 , as the region between the ground - state energies of the @xmath46 and @xmath47-particle states , which can be directly inferred from the single - particle spectral function .",
    "in vca , the reference system is chosen to be a decomposition of the total system into identical clusters , which means that the total lattice of @xmath16 sites is divided into clusters of size @xmath48 .",
    "mathematically this can be described by introducing a superlattice , such that the original lattice is recovered when a cluster is attached to each lattice site of the superlattice .",
    "the reference system defined on a cluster is solved by means of the band lanczos method .",
    "@xcite the initial vector of the iterative band lanczos method for the single - particle excitation term of the cluster green s function contains @xmath49 elements and is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the @xmath52 particle ground state . for the single - hole excitation term the initial vector of the band lanczos method",
    "is obtained by replacing the creation operators in eq.([eq : init ] ) by annihilation operators .    to evaluate the grand potential and the single - particle green s function of the original system we use the bosonic @xmath53-matrix formalism.@xcite this formalism yields the green s function @xmath54 in a mixed representation , partly in real space and partly in reciprocal space , see app .",
    "[ app : c ] .",
    "the matrix @xmath54 is of size @xmath55 and @xmath56 belongs to the first brillouin zone of the superlattice . due to the specific order of the creation operators in the initial vector of the band lanczos method we are able to extract the green s function for photons @xmath57 and the green s function for two - level excitations @xmath58 from @xmath59 in the following way @xmath60 where @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the application of the periodization prescription proposed in ref .",
    "( green s function periodization ) yields the fully @xmath62 dependent green s functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 . from that we are able to evaluate the single - particle spectral function @xmath65 the density of states @xmath66 and the momentum distribution @xmath67 where @xmath68 can be either @xmath69 for photons or @xmath70 for two - level excitations .",
    "we use the @xmath53-matrix formalism to evaluate the momentum distribution , since this approach yields particularly accurate results.@xcite furthermore we calculate the spatial correlation functions @xmath71 which just depend on the distance between two cavities @xmath0 and @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 . notice that the poles of the hard - core boson green s function coincide with the poles of the two - level excitation green s function as the energies of both representations are identical .",
    "however , the hard - core boson green s function exhibits additional poles located at energies of the order @xmath74 .",
    "the additional poles which have finite weight result from the fact that excitations such as @xmath75 are in principal allowed but cost infinite energy , whereas the corresponding excitation @xmath76 is strictly forbidden .",
    "therefore , the single - particle correlation functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 differ only by contributions from frequencies of the order @xmath74 . yet",
    "it should be mentioned that the single - hole correlations function of hard - core bosons is not affected by these considerations as @xmath79 is always equivalent to @xmath80 .",
    "this also implies that the spectral weight of the poles with negative energy are identical for both representations and that the particle density of the two - level system is equal to the particle density of the hard - core bosons . in the following",
    ", we will always speak loosely about two - level excitation green s functions but we have to keep in mind that there are differences in the single - particle spectral weight of the hard - core boson and two - level excitation green s functions at infinite energies .",
    "in the next step , we want to investigate the polaritonic properties of the jcl model , which arise due to the coupling between the photons and the two - level excitations .    adding a particle or hole to the many - body ground state",
    "may result in quasiparticle or collective excitations which are built up by the @xmath81-particle eigenstates of the many - body system entering the green s function .",
    "these many - body eigenstates for the infinite system can be extracted within the vca framework from the vca green s function . as shown in app .",
    "[ app : c ] , they are linear combinations of the particle and hole excitations of the cluster green s function weighted by the eigenvector matrix @xmath82 , defined in app .",
    "[ app : c ] .",
    "our goal is to describe the eigenvectors of the ( @xmath83)-particle hilbert space , which form the quasiparticle excitations of the green s function by polaritonic quasiparticles added to the exact @xmath52 particle groundstate @xmath51 . to this end",
    ", we introduce the polariton creation operators @xmath84 for particle excitations and @xmath85 for hole excitations as appropriate linear combinations of photons and two - level excitations    @xmath86    [ eq : polcreationops ]    it should be stressed that the hole creation operator is not the adjoint of the particle creation operator or its annihilation counterpart , which it would be in the case of noninteracting particles .",
    "as we will see , the coefficients or weights of the linear combinations @xmath87 and @xmath88 depend on the wave vector @xmath62 , the quasiparticle band @xmath89 , and additionally on the filling @xmath90 , which is not explicitly written in eq.([eq : polcreationops ] ) , since the filling dependence is not important for the present discussions .",
    "the normalized polariton quasiparticle states are defined by applying the polaritonic operators on the exact @xmath52 particle ground state @xmath51 yielding    [ eq : xxx1 ] @xmath91 [ eq : polwavefu ]    respectively .",

    "the overlap matrix for the hole excitations is given by @xmath96 where the static correlation functions are evaluated in the @xmath52 particle ground state @xmath51 .",

    "the situation is different , as we need to evaluate @xmath99 the term @xmath100 of the two - level system can not be directly evaluated in the hard - core boson model . using the commutator property",

    "the optimality criterion in this case is clearly the overlap of the exact eigenvector with the approximate ( normalized ) vector given in eqs.([eq : xxx1 ] ) and ( [ eq : xxx2 ] ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 denote the components of the two - dimensional vectors , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 , see app .",

    "as the eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the overlap squared @xmath119 , the deviation of the eigenvalue from one is a measure of the quality of the polariton approximation .",
    "it also points out that the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue determines the optimal polariton coefficients .",

    "quasiparticle weight_. in general , the quasiparticle peak is a superposition of several exact many - body eigenstates .",

    "the energies of the states @xmath352 are used , as the phase diagram is evaluated for the ground state .",
    "the comparison of the energies yields @xmath353 for the location of the phase boundary at zero hopping .",
    "in this appendix we evaluate the results of first - order degenerate perturbation theory for the single - particle and single - hole excitation bands of the jcl model . to apply first - order degenerate perturbation theory",
    "the matrix elements of the perturbation @xmath354 , where @xmath355 is the hopping matrix , have to be evaluated with respect to the degenerate states @xmath356 and @xmath357 , see eq.([eq : psidegenerate ] ) . as",
    "the hopping term @xmath358 does not change the total particle number and does not effect the excitation @xmath89 , the following two matrices have to be evaluated ; one for single - particle excitations @xmath359 and one for single - hole excitations @xmath360 plugging eq.([eq : psi1 ] ) in eq.([eq : mp ] ) yields @xmath361 due to the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of sectors with different particle number , the conditions @xmath362 and @xmath363 hold , which reduce the matrix elements to @xmath364 in the second step , we dropped the site index as the expectation value does not depend on the specific lattice site .",
    "the corrected matrix elements are thus the old ones with renormalized hopping strength @xmath365 analogously , one obtains @xmath366 for the matrix elements defined in eq.([eq : mh ] ) . from that the renormalized hopping strength for single - hole excitations is evaluated as @xmath367 the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath368 are the first - order corrections and thus the corrected energies @xmath369 of the one - dimensional jcl model are given by    @xmath370    respectively , where @xmath371 is a wave vector of the first brillouin zone . within first - order degenerate perturbation",
    "theory we obtain @xmath372 for the single - particle excitation band and @xmath373 for the singe - hole excitation band .",
    "in this appendix , we want to analyze the polaritonic feature in the single - site limit for zero detuning .    in the single - site limit",
    "it is exactly possible to construct a polariton operator which , applied to the many - body eigenstate @xmath286 , generates the eigenstates @xmath285 .",
    "the polaritonic weights follow from @xmath374 here , we explicitly include the filling @xmath90 as index .",
    "so the relative weights are @xmath375 for the upper band ( @xmath273 ) and @xmath376 for the lower band ( @xmath377 ) .",
    "this means that in the lower band the weights have opposite sign and the polaritons are of predominant photonic character , while the opposite applies to the upper band .",
    "the modulus of relative weight is just the inverse , i.e. , @xmath378 .",
    "next , we study the hole case for @xmath98 @xmath379 which is positive for both bands @xmath274 .",
    "again we have the reciprocal property @xmath380 and the lower band has predominantly photonic character , while the opposite is the case in the upper band .",
    "now we want to scrutinize the generalized eigenvalue problem of the green s function .",
    "the single - site green s function reads @xmath381 where we introduced the operators @xmath382 and @xmath383 . for the single - particle term",
    "we obtain @xmath384 with the definition @xmath385 the integrated spectral density for the particle part can be expressed as @xmath386 the overlap matrix @xmath387 is readily obtained by the spectral theorem @xmath388 and the generalized eigenvalue problem for the polariton weights according to eq.([eq : gen_ev ] ) reads @xmath389 the eigenvalues are zero and one . for the polariton weights we are interested in the latter .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is simply given by the vector orthogonal to @xmath390 @xmath391 with that one obtains for the ratio of the weights @xmath392 which is in agreement with the exact result in eq.([eq : appyy ] ) .",
    "now we address the hole case , again for @xmath98 , @xmath393 we proceed as in the particle case with the definition of @xmath394 .",
    "the remaining steps are the same as before and we end up with @xmath395 which is also in agreement with the exact result , see eq.([eq : appyy2 ] ) .",
    "so we see that the determination of the polaritonic weight via the generalized eigenvalue problem is reasonable . in the single - site limit",
    ", the exact many - body eigenstates @xmath285 can be generated correctly by suitable polariton operators acting on the state @xmath286 .",
    "the operators are , however , not universal , they depend on @xmath90 and in the lattice case even on @xmath62 . on top of that , the polariton creation operator for holes is not the adjoint of the corresponding polariton creation operator of the particle type , or in other words its annihilation operator",
