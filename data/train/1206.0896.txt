    "dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) techniques are attracting increasing interest due to their proven ability of improving the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments by several orders of magnitude , not only in the solid state @xcite but also in solution @xcite . although the disruptive potential of dnp is nowadays well known and accepted , the articulated physical scenario underlying these complex phenomena is still puzzling the scientific community .    in the solid state ,",
    "three different dnp regimes can be specified according to the resonance frequency @xmath0 of the nuclei to be polarized , the width @xmath1 of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) line of the free radicals used as polarization source and the magnitude of dipolar coupling between those radicals @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 the main mechanism for nuclei to polarize , known as solid effect ( se ) , proceeds via microwave ( mw ) assisted forbidden transitions involving simultaneous flip - flops or flip - flips of one electron and one nucleus in mutual dipolar interaction .",
    "the se model has been extensively described in @xcite and the role played by spin diffusion was discussed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , an exact quantum mechanical treatment of the se based on the density matrix approach has been proposed by hovav et al .",
    "@xcite and by karabanov and collaborators @xcite .    on the other side , when @xmath4 , nuclei can flip between different zeeman levels within an energy conserving three particle mechanism involving a simultaneous flip - flop of two electron spins ( referred as @xmath5 process hereafter )",
    ". such process , driven by electron - electron and electron - nucleus time dependent dipolar interactions , does not involve forbidden transitions and it is thus in general more effective than se . as far as the typical interaction time @xmath6 between different paramagnetic centres",
    "is long compared to the electron spin lattice relaxation time @xmath7 ( _ i.e. _ the unpaired electrons are - on average - relatively far from each other ) , the polarization mechanism is referred as cross effect ( ce ) and was first analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the ce model has been successfully exploited to describe dnp with bi - radicals @xcite , _ i.e. _ polarization procedures where the polarizing agents are tailored molecules carrying two unpaired electrons having resonance frequencies differing exactly by @xmath0 .",
    "similarly to se , also the ce model has been rigorously computed by @xmath8 @xmath9 quantum mechanical techniques @xcite .    however , the novel applications which in the last decade have renewed the attention on dnp due to their potential impact on biosciences @xcite , are based on samples which generally fall in none of the two models previously described .",
    "the nuclei of interest for this kind of applications ( typically @xmath10c or @xmath11n ) have a low - gyromagnetic ratio @xmath12 and , as a consequence , a resonance frequency @xmath0 significantly smaller than the width of the typical radicals used as polarizing agent ( trityls or nitroxides ) .",
    "moreover , the concentration of these radicals , usually above 10 mm in the solution to polarize , leads to non negligible electron spin - spin interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ to the condition @xmath13 that define the thermal mixing ( tm ) regime . under tm assumptions ,",
    "when a transition is saturated by an external , frequency selective , microwave field , the whole electron spin distribution reacts through energy conserving flip - flops ( spectral diffusion ) and evolves towards a new steady state different from boltzman equilibrium .",
    "hence , via the previously introduced @xmath5 processes , the nuclear zeeman populations are also perturbed and , depending on the frequency of the saturated electron transition , possibly result in depleting or enhancing the population of the ground state and thus in an enhanced nuclear magnetic order . at high temperature , where a linear expansion of the density matrix can be used ,",
    "the evolution of the electron and nuclear polarizations is accounted by a set of rate equations formulated by provotorov @xcite . at the typical temperatures ( about 1 k ) where most of the dnp experiments aimed to obtain substantial nuclear polarization values ( @xmath14 0.1 ) are performed , however , a linear expansion of the density matrix is not allowed and consequently the provotorov approach does not apply . fortunately in these conditions ,",
    "the electron resonance lines of the free radicals used as polarizing agents are normally inhomogeneously broadened and can likely be depicted as the convolution of several individual packets of given resonance frequency , mutually connected by the electron - electron dipolar interaction @xcite .",
    "hyperpolarization via tm at low temperature has been first discussed by borghini , who also calculated the steady state solution for the electron and nuclear polarization after imposing certain constrains to the model @xcite .",
    "the same - steady state - result has been achieved by abragam and goldman @xcite using a slightly different mathematical procedure .",
    "the borghini prediction has the merit of reproducing , at least qualitatively , many observations obtained in dnp experiments at low temperature @xcite .",
    "it has , at the same time , several limitations , the major of them listed below .",
    "* it provides a picture of the steady state polarization without contributing in any way to the understanding of the time evolution of nuclear spin order towards equilibrium . *",
    "it is obtained by assuming an _ a priori _ analytical form for the electron spin polarization . *",
    "it is derived under strong saturation conditions and in the limit of perfect contact between the electron and the nuclear reservoirs ; the latter hypothesis consists in assuming highly effective @xmath5 processes .    as a consequence of the constrains ii ) and iii ) , the model leads to a final steady state nuclear polarization which substantially depends only on the lattice temperature , the magnetic field in which the dnp phenomenon takes place and the width of the electron resonance line .",
    "the sample specific parameters like electron and nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rates and the relative concentration of the two spin species play only a secondary role .    in this work",
    "we aim to overcome these three limitations by introducing a dynamic analysis of the low temperature tm model ( described in detail in section [ mandm ] ) based on a set of rate equations presented in section [ rateequationsapproach ] which spontaneously provide the time evolution laws of the electron and nuclear polarizations without any _ a priori _ assumption on their functional form .",
    "the results obtained by numerically solving the rate equations are reported in section [ numericalresults ] and discussed in section [ discussionandconclusion ] , with particular emphasis on the modifications occurring in the steady state and in the dynamic parameters in the presence of nuclear leakage and finite electron - nucleus exchange .",
    "the technical arguments underlying the derivation of the rate equations set are given in appendix [ detailedbalance ] and [ rateeqderivation ] , while in appendix [ borghirel ] , for convenience of the reader , the derivation of the borghini equation for the steady state as proposed by abragam and goldman @xcite is briefly recalled .",
    "a system made up of @xmath15 nuclear spins @xmath16 with larmor frequency @xmath0 and @xmath17 electron spins @xmath18 with mean larmor frequency @xmath19 is considered ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "typically @xmath19 is about three orders of magnitude higher than @xmath0 .",
    "since all terms in the nuclear hamiltonian with the exception of the zeeman one are small in comparison to the other energy scales considered , nuclei are assumed to resonate all at the same frequency .",
    "the first assumption of the model is that the main contribution to the esr line shape is the spread of @xmath21-factors ( inhomogeneous broadening of the i type ) , that reflects the different orientation of the unpaired magnetic moments with respect to the external magnetic field due to single ion anisotropy .",
    "the practical relevance of this assumption is confirmed , for instance , by the experimental evidence obtained from the widely used trityl radical family @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneously broadened lines are conveniently decomposed in a sequence of narrow individual spin packets of frequency @xmath22 , width @xmath23 and relative weight @xmath24 ( see  [ figureesr ] ) such that : @xmath25 valid for any esr line .",

    "the @xmath5 process , being promoted by dipolar interactions , involves only nuclei which are sufficiently close to paramagnetic centres .",
    "thanks to nuclear spin diffusion , the local information is then spread throughout the entire system . a model which takes into account both these aspects ( local dipolar interaction and spatial diffusion ) would be very cumbersome to treat , because of the @xmath15 degrees of freedom . in the present work we adopt a mean field approach where all possible terns comprising a nucleus and two electrons flip with a characteristic time @xmath43 which does not depend on the mutual distances between the three particles .",
    "setting low values of @xmath44 the model mimics the fast spin diffusion limit , while setting high values of @xmath44 the model mimics the slow spin diffusion limit .    _ electron spin - lattice relaxation . _ the process , shown in  [ figuretransitions ] , panel d , accounts for the contact between the electron system and the lattice which leads @xmath45 towards the electron thermal equilibrium polarization @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the temperature of the lattice .",

    "in fact , if a finite @xmath145 is considered in eq.([borghinirelation ] ) , a loss of @xmath87 is obtained , that however , with @xmath145 generally being longer than @xmath185 s @xcite , can hardly exceed @xmath103 - @xmath186 ( cfr .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",
    "a severe reduction of @xmath87 is obtained instead by means of the equation set ( [ rateeq ] ) , introducing a finite contact between nuclei and electrons in presence of a small leakage ( see  [ figure5 ] ) .",
    "it is worth to notice that in absence of leakage , _",
    "i.e. _ when nuclei are isolated by the lattice , the final polarization is not affected by the efficiency of the contact between electron and nuclear systems .",
    "besides providing a more flexible scenario for @xmath87 , the proposed mathematical framework allows the computation of polarization and relaxation times .",
    "two regimes have been identified .",
    "when the contact between nuclei and electrons is highly efficient , the bottleneck of the spin dynamics is @xmath7 and , by setting the parameters of the simulation according the experimental conditions used in @xcite one obtains @xmath187 s and @xmath188 s , as effectively measured in @xcite . it is interesting to observe that , in this fast exchange limit",
    ", an estimation of the order of magnitude of @xmath93 and @xmath97 can be heuristically derived as follows . during polarization , the nuclear system transfers energy to electrons , which are cooled by the lattice . in a time @xmath7",
    ", the lattice can absorb an energy proportional at most to @xmath17 , so that @xmath189 s , with @xmath105 . during relaxation ,",
    "the effective number of electrons that can absorb energy from the nuclear system , proportional to @xmath190 , collapses to @xmath191 due to the high electron polarization @xmath192 at 3.35 t and 1.2 k , thus explaining the factor @xmath193 observed both in simulations and experiments .",
    "on decreasing the effectiveness of the contact between nuclear and electron spins , a different regime is established , where the @xmath5 process becomes the rate determining step and both @xmath93 and @xmath97 become longer .",
    "this provides a possible explanation of why @xmath93 can range between very different values in samples with the same ratio @xmath194 polarized in analogous conditions . by way of example",
    ", one can compare the @xmath195-@xmath10c@xmath196$]-pyruvic acid samples doped with 15 mm of trityl radical studied in @xcite , where @xmath197 and @xmath198 s with the @xmath195-@xmath10c@xmath196$]-butyric acid sample mixed with @xmath199 in volume of dmso and doped with 10 mm trityl radical analyzed in @xcite , having a much longer @xmath200 s while the ratio @xmath201 remains almost unchanged .    in conclusion",
    ", we propose a novel approach based on rate equations for studying the dependency of dynamic nuclear polarization in the low temperature thermal mixing regime ( @xmath202 ) from the microscopic transitions involving electron and nuclear spins .",
    "this approach allows the recovery of the whole build - up curve and , in the limit of perfect contact between nuclei and electrons and infinite microwave power , leads to the same final nuclear polarization predicted by borghini .",
    "in addition , by tuning the efficiency of the exchange interaction between nuclei and electrons , different values of @xmath87 are reached , providing an interpretation key for those experimental observations of @xmath87 which are not simply accounted for by leakage terms depending only by spin concentration and spin - lattice relaxation times .",
    "the rate equation approach can be easily extended to more complex experimental systems . a second nuclear reservoir which also participates in tm could _",
    "e.g. _ be included to interpret the dynamic experimental data measured in nitroxyl doped samples ( where both @xmath10c and @xmath203h larmor frequencies do not exceed the esr line width @xcite ) or , similarly , in trityl doped samples containing @xmath10c and @xmath204y nuclei , both in contact with the electron reservoir @xcite .",
    "finally the versatility of the approach proposed here would easily allow to introduce new dissipative processes violating the precise assumptions and conservation principles the borghini prediction is based on and that could possibly be useful to justify the many unexplained observations of low temperature dnp , _ e.g. _ the reduction of @xmath87 on increasing @xmath17 @xcite .",
