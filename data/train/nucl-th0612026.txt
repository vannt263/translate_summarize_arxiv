    "in a series of recent articles @xcite we have developed a novel approach to nuclear density functional theory which emphasizes the relationship between aspects of low - energy , non - perturbative qcd and the nuclear many - body dynamics .",
    "a relativistic nuclear energy density functional has been formulated , starting from two basic features which establish the link with low - energy qcd and its symmetry - breaking pattern : ( a ) strong scalar and vector fields related to in - medium changes of qcd vacuum condensates ; ( b ) long- and intermediate - range interactions generated by one - and two - pion exchange , derived from in - medium chiral perturbation theory , with explicit inclusion of @xmath0 excitations and in combination with three - nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .    the resulting nuclear matter energy density functional  @xcite is mapped  @xcite onto the exchange - correlation energy density functional of a covariant point - coupling model for finite nuclei , including second order gradient corrections . in this approach",
    "the nuclear ground state is determined by the self - consistent solution of the relativistic generalizations of the linear single - nucleon kohn - sham equations .",
    "the construction of the density functional involves an expansion of nucleon self - energies in powers of the fermi momentum up to and including terms of order @xmath1 . in comparison with purely phenomenological mean - field models , the built - in qcd constraints and the explicit treatment of pion exchange",
    "restrict the freedom in adjusting parameters and functional forms of the density - dependent couplings .",
    "this approach to nuclear dynamics has been tested in an analysis of ground - state properties of a broad range of spherical and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the results have been compared with experimental data on binding energies , charge radii , neutron radii and deformation parameters for several isotopic chains .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the results for nuclear ground - state properties are at the same level of quantitative comparison with data as the best phenomenological relativistic mean - field models .    in this work",
    "the low - energy qcd - constrained nuclear density functional framework will be extended to the description of excited states and , in particular , to spin - isospin collective excitations .",
    "starting from the relativistic point - coupling hartree - bogoliubov model of ref .",
    "@xcite , we formulate the proton - neutron ( quasiparticle ) random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) .",
    "this is then applied in an analysis of isobaric analog states and gamow - teller resonances in doubly - closed and open - shell nuclei .",
    "our aim is to study the role of chiral pion - nucleon dynamics in charge - exchange modes .",
    "the results will be compared with available data , and with qrpa calculations performed using one of the modern phenomenological relativistic density - dependent effective interactions based on the meson - exchange representation of effective nuclear forces .",
    "the matrix equations of the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) for an effective lagrangian with explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings have been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , and for nucleon - nucleon point - coupling effective lagrangians in ref .",
    "the relativistic qrpa for collective excitations in open - shell nuclei has been formulated in ref .",

    "the extension to spin and isospin excitations ( pn - qrpa ) has been described in ref .",
    "our implementation of the pn - qrpa is identical to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the important difference that it is now based on the point - coupling effective lagrangian with density - dependent couplings determined by chiral pion - nucleon dynamics  @xcite , rather than on phenomenological meson - exchange effective interactions .",
    "here we only collect the essential expressions and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for technical details of the relativistic qrpa .",
    "we consider transitions between the @xmath2 ground state of a spherical even - even parent nucleus and a state with angular momentum and parity @xmath3 of the odd - odd daughter nucleus .",
    "the spin - isospin dependent coupling terms are generated by the following interaction parts of the lagrangian density : @xmath4 the first term @xmath5 collects the isovector parts of the nuclear density functional of ref .",

    "@xcite . the same approach , without further adjustment , will also be used for the proton - neutron particle - hole ( @xmath8 ) residual interaction .",

    "the four landau - migdal parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 which characterize the four spin - isospin channels of the isotropic ( @xmath20 ) part of the n - n quasiparticle interaction , have been calculated using in - medium chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",
    "this calculation includes contributions from @xmath21-exchange , iterated @xmath21-exchange and @xmath14-exchange with virtual @xmath0-isobar excitations .",
    "the resulting dependence on the fermi momentum @xmath22 is converted into density dependence using the relation for symmetric nuclear matter : @xmath23 .",
    "in general , the explicit density dependence of the couplings introduces additional rearrangement terms in the residual two - body interaction of the rrpa @xcite .",
    "however , since these terms include the corresponding isoscalar ground - state densities , it is easy to see that they are absent in the charge - exchange channels , and the residual two - body interaction reads : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the @xmath26 matrix representation of the spin operator . we note that there is no double counting of the one - pion contribution , because the hartree diagram does not contribute to the isotropic part of the quasi - nucleon interaction in the long wavelength limit , i.e. to @xmath27 @xcite .",
