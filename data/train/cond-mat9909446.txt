    "since the interpretation of transport measurements in these regards is often hampered by the presence of defects and by the importance of electron - lattice interactions , high - energy spectroscopies which directly probe the electronic degrees of freedom are often used for preliminary estimations of model parameters . in these estimations",

    "the renormalization of model parameters in the final state can produce a significant uncertainty in estimated values of these parameters in the ground state .",
    "in this situation , x - ray scattering techniques become very attractive because the scattering process is charge - neutral .    by now , it has been proven that at some core - thresholds of electron - correlated systems x - ray emission spectroscopy with monochromatic photon excitation can be considered as an analog of these techniques so that the excitation - radiative deexcitation channel can be treated as resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) process .",
    "final states probed via such a channel are related to eigenvalues of the ground state hamiltonian .",

    "= 7.0 cm    according to the many - body picture , an energy of a photon , scattered on a certain low - energy excitation , should change by the same amount as a change in an excitation energy of the primary beam ( see a decay route of core excitation @xmath14 versus that of @xmath15 ) so that inelastic scattering structures have constant energy losses and follow the elastic peak on the emitted - photon energy scale . in the single - particle view",
    ", energy positions of specific inelastic - scattering structures with respect to the elastic peak which are defined by the momentum conservation rule may vary only within the energy range covered by the occupied part of the valence band . in fig .",
    "1a , this is reflected in the situation when , for core excitation @xmath14 with the higher energy , the radiative decay results in a transition with the lower energy than those for @xmath15 , respectively . in spite of simplifications made here , the outlined differences can be used to test the validity of one or another model for a system in question .    as an example , we use data from ref .",

    "this indicates the importance of electron correlation effects in uo@xmath17 .",
    "although , the information provided by the rixs technique is similar to that obtained from optical absorption or low - energy electron - energy - loss ( eels ) spectroscopies , there are some advantages in using this method :    1 .",

    "rich multiplets can be partly hidden under intense inter - band transitions .",
    "for instance , @xmath2-@xmath2 excitations of mno with energies of around 5 ev and higher can hardly be observed in optical and eels spectra @xcite for that reason .",
    "whereas , rixs do not have this disadvantage as can be seen from the analysis of the data in figs .",

    "mn @xmath39 ( @xmath40 transitions ) x - ray fluorescence spectra of single - crystal mno ( 100 ) , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , can be ordered by assigning the peaks to one of three categories : the recombination ( elastic ) peak , the resonating loss structures due to @xmath2-@xmath2 excitations and charge transfer transitions ( i.  e. rixs structures ) , and the normal @xmath41 x - ray emission lines which appear at constant energies of emitted photons .",
    "the electronic recombination peak is at the same energy as the excitation energy , except for the possibility of phonon losses .",
    "[ h ]    = 7.5 cm    the relative intensity of the recombination peak decreases with increasing excitation energy .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of the spin ordering of the excited states .",
    "the lowest @xmath42 intermediate states would have the highest possible spin ( also sextets ) . if these states decay , they are likely to end up again as a sextet , the @xmath43 ground state , contributing to the recombination line .",
    "but at higher energies in the @xmath44 absorption multiplet one finds quartets and doublets ( spin is not conserved because of the large    [ h ]    = 8.0 cm    @xmath45 spin - orbit interaction ) .",
    "these higher - lying quartets are less likely to recombine into the sextet ground state , which explains the relatively weak recombination line .",
    "this general ordering of the spin states in the intermediate state is not only true within the @xmath44 region , but also over the whole spectrum , as explained by thole and van der laan @xcite . within the @xmath46 region ,",

    "[ fig3]@xmath47 ) than on the first maximum ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]@xmath3 ) .",
    "another qualititative explanation for the trends in the intensity of the elastic peak is that if the absorption is relatively weak , the optical matrix element from the excited state back to the ground state is also small , and the core hole is more likely to decay to an excited final state .",

    "the radial parts of the 3@xmath2 - 3@xmath2 and 2@xmath38 - 3@xmath2 coulomb and exchange multipole interactions ( so - called slater integrals ) were scaled down to 80% of their hartree - fock values to account for intra - atomic configuration interaction and hybridization effects .",

    "are often disregarded in the interpretation of experimental data by applying a pure atomic approximation ( mainly for high - energy spectroscopies ) or by using a first order crystal - field theory where the crystal field interaction is assumed to act only within the separate @xmath1 manifolds .",
    "this is partly due to complications in extracting information about the ground state @xmath1-mixing directly from the data .",
    "for example , the estimation of the @xmath1-mixing degree in high - order crystal - field theory by adjusting the crystal - field parameters from the fit of optical absorption or low - energy electron - energy - loss spectra @xcite may result in a large uncertainty originating from difficulties calculating the intensities of dipole - forbidden transitions . in turn",
    ", the possible influence of the weak metal - ligand hybridization is difficult to analyze quantitatively in the absence of so - called charge - transfer satellites in high - energy spectroscopic data .    in this situation , the use of alternate spectroscopic means to obtain ground - state @xmath1-mixing information is essential .",
    "recently , finazzi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that this mixing can be studied by taking advantage of dichroic properties of rare - earth @xmath0 x - ray absorption .",

    "similar to optical absorption and eels with respect to probing the optical scale excitations , rixs at the same time provides an additional level of the transition selectivity due to the element specificity and dipole selection rules .",
    "in contrast to systems with the strong metal - ligand hybridization where the charge - transfer process leads to an appearance of intense lines in rixs spectra as a result of inter - ionic excitations , @xmath1-mixing in systems with weak hybridization effects is expected to manifest itself in an intensity gain of some intra - ionic ( @xmath3-@xmath3 ) transitions which are disallowed for the pure hund - rule ground state .",
    "in other words , transitions with @xmath110 other than 0 , @xmath1111 , and @xmath1112 are probed in the resonant excitation - deexcitation process .",

    "a discussion about the rixs potential to probe the ground - state @xmath1-mixing is based on analysis of data obtained at the dy @xmath112 threshold of dyf@xmath17 at room temperature .",
    "measurements at the @xmath112 threshold of rare - earths provide naturally higher resolution than those at the @xmath0 threshold , thus allowing one to study elementary excitations in greater detail ( see e.  g. ref .",

    "two distinct groups of pronounced inelastic - scattering peaks are observed in these spectra . the first group is distinguished by small energy losses on the tail of the elastic line , whereas the second is characterized by energy losses more than 2.5 ev . when the excitation energy approaches the main broad maximum of the dy @xmath112 absorption edge , the first group still possesses significant intensity while the structures of the second group become relatively faint .",
    "regarding the energy scale on which the spectral variations occur , the observed transitions can be attributed to intra - ionic @xmath3-@xmath3 excitations . the energy gap between two groups of inelastic x - ray scattering structures reflects the separation between sextets and quartets of trivalent dy @xcite which can be reached due to the excitation - deexcitation process .",
    "indeed , the overall spectral shapes and their behavior with varying excitation energies are reasonably well reproduced by atomic multiplet calculations for the dy@xmath113 ion @xcite .",
    "the results of calculations show that the dominant elastic peak in all of the rixs spectra of dyf@xmath17 is to large extent a consequence of strong interference effects in the intermediate state of the coherent second - order optical process .",
    "the states constituting the main 4@xmath2 absorption edge have a lifetime broadening of about 2 ev largely because of the @xmath114 coster - kronig decay .",
    "however , a close inspection of experimental rixs spectra shows that there are some spectral structures which are not revealed in calculations within the pure atomic approximation .",

    "the excitation energy was taken to be the same as that for experimental spectrum @xmath115 ( since the intensity of extra - structures is higher for excitation energies at the main absorption edge ) and the core - hole lifetime broadening was set to 2.0 ev . according to these calculations , the spectral weight at an energy loss of about 1.17 ev ( transitions to @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) should constitute 56 % and 217 % of that at 1.0 ev ( transitions to @xmath118 ) for @xmath116 and @xmath117 as initial states , respectively .",
    "although , accounting for weak but finite dy @xmath125-f @xmath45 hybridization may give rise to some changes in calculated relative intensities in both cases , it is clear that an admixture of the @xmath124 component in the ground state results in a stronger effect than that for the @xmath123 component .",
    "since the degree of @xmath1-mixing in dyf@xmath17 is relatively low , the @xmath124 contribution to the ground states is expected to be comparable with the @xmath123 contribution in order to explain the noticeable weight of `` forbidden '' transitions in the inelastic scattering spectra in fig .",

    "[ fig16 ] shows the 1.0 - 2.2 ev energy - loss region of the spectra calculated using a pure atomic approximation and crystal field multiplet theory .",
    "it is clear that switching on the crystal field gives rise to additional transitions .",
    "the calculated intensities are low to fully account for the observed spectral weight in experimental data at the corresponding energy loss .",
    "this suggests that inter - atomic coupling is also important for the description of the inelastic - scattering profile in the energy loss range between 1.0 and 2.0 ev and that the appearance of additional structures is rather a combined effect of the crystal - field interaction and dy @xmath125-f @xmath45 hybridization .",
    "however , the calculations which would take into account both the crystal field and f @xmath86dy @xmath125 charge transfer excitations are complicated by a huge number of multiplets and require large computational resources . at present , they are out of the scope of the paper .",
    "the existance of @xmath1-mixing in the intermediate state raises a question about how strongly the inelastic - scattering intensity at energy losses between 1.0 ev and 2.0 ev is related to @xmath1-mixing in the ground state of dyf@xmath17 . to estimate this , crystal - field multiplet calculations with",

[ fig16 ] ) shows no significant changes in the inelastic - scattering intensities of `` forbidden '' structures on switching off @xmath1-mixing in the core - excited state .",
    "one of the main reasons for that is a large core - hole lifetime broadening . as a whole ,",

    "<S> in some cases , the data are compared with the results of crystal - field multiplet and anderson impurity model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> advantages of this technigue are pointed out , such as an ability to probe an extended multiplet structure of the ground state configuration , which is not fully accessible by other spectroscopies , an extreme sensitivity of spectral profiles to the chemical state of the element in question and to the crystal - field strength , and a great potential in probing the ground state character ( for example , ground state @xmath1-mixing in rare - earths ) due to the technique s elemental selectivity and strict selection rules . </S>",
    "<S> issues are addressed , such as a possible deviations from the linear dispersion of inelastic scattering structures , corresponding to charge - transfer excitations , with varying excitation energies and an estimation of values for model parameters , involved in the description of charge - transfer processes .    </S>",
