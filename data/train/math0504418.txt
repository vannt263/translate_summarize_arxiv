    "scholl then defined projectors such that the realizations of the associated chow motives are these parabolic cohomology groups .",

    "getzler has initiated the study of the cohomology @xmath21 of the moduli space of smooth @xmath0-pointed curves of genus  @xmath17 as a representation of @xmath9 . through the theory of modular operads , as developed by getzler and kapranov , the @xmath9-equivariant euler characteristics of the cohomology of the spaces @xmath19 are expressed in the @xmath9-equivariant euler characteristics of the cohomology of the spaces @xmath22 .",
    "the action of @xmath9 is crucial here .",
    "another central idea of getzler is to express the @xmath9-equivariant euler characteristic of @xmath21 in terms of the euler characteristics of the cohomology of irreducible symplectic local systems on @xmath23 .",
    "since these local systems are pulled back from the moduli space @xmath24 of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension  @xmath17 , this provides a connection with genus  @xmath17 siegel modular forms .    in genus  @xmath1 , this connection is given by eichler - shimura theory . in higher genus , despite the very important work of faltings and chai , much less is known .",
    "van der geer and the second author have obtained an explicit conjectural formula for the motivic euler characteristics of these local systems in genus  @xmath25 .",
