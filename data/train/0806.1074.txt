    "<S> the ordering temperature of a quasi - one - dimensional system , consisting of weakly interacting quantum spin-1/2 chains with antiferromagnetic spin - frustrating couplings ( or zig - zag ladder ) is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that a quantum critical point between two phases of the one - dimensional subsystem plays a crucial role . if the one - dimensional subsystem is in the antiferromagnetic - like phase in the ground state , similar to the phase of a spin chain without frustration , weak couplings yield magnetic ordering of the nel type . for intra - chain spin - frustrating interactions larger than the critical one ( at which the quantum phase transition takes place ) , the quasi - one - dimensional spin system manifests a spiral magnetic incommensurate ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results of our quantum theory are compared with the quasi - classical approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated features of magnetic ordering are expected to be generic for weakly coupled quantum spin chains with gapless excitations and spin - frustrating nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the interest in quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) quantum spin systems has grown considerably during the last decades . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic feature of quasi-1d magnets is the strong spin - spin interaction along one space direction , much stronger than the couplings along all other directions . </S>",
    "<S> the interest is motivated , on the one hand , by the progress in preparation of substances with well defined 1d subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> another reason for studying quasi-1d spin systems is the possibility to compare experimental data with results of non - perturbative theories for 1d models . </S>",
    "<S> also , such systems often manifest quantum phase transitions that take place in the ground state , and which are governed by other parameters than the temperature , like external magnetic field , pressure , concentration of impurities ( internal pressure ) , etc . from the experimental viewpoint , quasi-1d spin-1/2 systems differ from other magnets due to special features in the behavior of their characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat of quasi-1d spin systems with dominant nearest neighbor ( nn ) interactions reveal maxima ( in a small external magnetic field at temperatures of the order of the exchange coupling constant along the distinguished direction ) . @xcite for spin systems , which 1d subsystems have a gapless spectrum of low - lying excitations at temperatures , much lower than the temperature of the maximum of the @xmath0-dependence of the susceptibility , the latter and the specific heat often manifest peculiarities , characteristic for phase transitions to low - temperature magnetically ordered states at critical temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> also , a great attention has been recently given to spin systems with a spin frustration . </S>",
    "<S> for most of antiferromagnetic ( af ) systems the ground state corresponds to nel - like configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the standard quasi - classical description of af systems uses quantization of small deviations of vectors of magnetizations ( magnetic order parameters ) of af sublattices from their steady - state configuration . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a description of af systems can be used for bipartite magnetic structures . for af systems with a spin frustration </S>",
    "<S> the competing interactions produce a very high degeneracy of such steady - state configurations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in most cases it is hopeless to use the approximation of magnetic sublattices . from the theoretical viewpoint </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes even worse in quasi-1d spin systems with a spin frustration . </S>",
    "<S> for those systems quantum fluctuations are enhanced due to peculiarities in the 1d density of states . </S>",
    "<S> this is why , according to the famous mermin - wagner theorem , @xcite 1d spin systems with short - range interactions can not have any magnetic ordering even at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , approximate methods of theoretical physics often produce significant errors in the description of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is necessary to study them non - perturbatively , better exactly , which is , fortunately , possible for few cases for 1d quantum spin systems . </S>",
    "<S> probably one of the simplest and most known examples of a quantum spin system with a spin frustration is the heisenberg spin-@xmath2 chain with af nearest neighbor ( nn ) and af next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of such a model can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the couplings between nn and nnn , respectively ( here we consider only the case with an even number of spins @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is equivalent to a zig - zag spin ladder with obvious re - notation of indices . </S>",
    "<S> the system with the hamiltonian ( [ hnnn ] ) is , obviously , spin - frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> several limiting cases are known exactly . </S>",
    "<S> namely , for @xmath7 ( or for @xmath8 ) the hamiltonian ( [ hnnn ] ) is reduced to the hamiltonian of one ( or two decoupled ) heisenberg af spin-@xmath2 chain(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state for those cases is a non - degenerate singlet , without long - range orderings , and the low - energy excitations are gapless spinons . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the other limiting case , for which the ground state is known exactly , is the so - called majumdar - ghosh point , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in that case the hamiltonian of the zig - zag spin ladder can be re - written as @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is given by two degenerate singlets of the resonance valence bond type , without long - range ordering , and the low - lying excitations are gapped . for other values of the coupling constants it is , unfortunately , impossible , to obtain exact answers . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , an approximate bosonization description and numerical calculations suggest that there is no long - range magnetic ordering in the system , and that for @xmath11 a spin gap is opened for the low - lying excitations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a quasi - classical approximation of the model yields the following . if one replaces the spin operators by classical vectors , two steady - state configurations are possible . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the period 2 commensurate and collinear af nel configuration , stable for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the second one , stable for @xmath13 , is a noncollinear incommensurate spiral magnetic structure with the pitch angle @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> such a description implies a long - range magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> this means that it might be approximately valid for , e.g. , a quasi-1d spin system , consisting of weakly coupled 1d spin chains with nn and nnn af interactions , at temperatures , lower than the ordering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , for quasi-1d spin systems with a spin gap @xmath15 for low - energy excitations of their 1d subsystems , a weak inter - chain coupling , as a rule , does not produce a magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( this is plausible at least for spin systems with isotropic exchange interactions : the exponential decay of the long - range spin - spin correlation function @xmath16 with a finite coherence length @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fermi velocity of the low - lying spin excitations , conflicts with the magnetic order requiring asymptotically nondecaying spin - spin correlation functions . )    on the other hand , it is clear that spin frustration in a 1d subsystem has to yield features in transitions to possible magnetically ordered state for a quasi-1d system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as follows from ref .   </S>",
    "<S> ( see also ref .  ) despite the fact that for most of studied compounds exchange constants satisfy the condition @xmath11 , the spin gap was not confirmed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> to describe such experimental situations ( i.e.  quasi-1d af spin systems with spin frustration of intra - chain interactions without spin gap and with a weak inter - chain coupling ) , we consider another model , the hamiltonian of which consists of @xmath19 with multi - spin interaction . such a model is known to have gapless low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> those multi - spin interactions do not change the spin frustration property from the classical viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the advantage of the proposed model is the exact integrability : the model permits an exact solution by means of the bethe s ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> we do not state here , naturally , that the model describes all features of the materials of current experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , many properties of the model are similar to what was observed in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> at least , for this model the low - lying excitations are gapless . </S>",
    "<S> hence , from this viewpoint , they qualitatively agree with the data of experiments , unlike the model with the hamiltonian @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> multiple spin exchange interactions are often present in oxides of transition metals , where a direct exchange between magnetic ions is complimented by a superexchange between magnetic ions via nonmagnetic ones . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite models with multi - spin interactions are believed to be closer to real quasi-1d magnets compared to standard ones with only nn spin couplings . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> multi - spin exchange models were introduced by thouless already in 1965 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite later similar models were used to study some cuprates @xcite and spin ladders . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the consistent explanation of several experiments @xcite by means of inelastic neutron scattering , optical conductivity and nuclear magnetic resonance one needs to account for relatively large values of nnn spin - spin interactions and multi - spin interactions between four neighboring sites of the spin ladder ( the so - called ring exchange ) . </S>",
    "<S> similar four - spin interactions were used recently in the theory of 2d quantum spin systems , where they regulate the quantum phase transition between the nel - like ground state and the resonance valence bond solid one . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the hamiltonian of the 1d subsystem of the quasi-1d model , studied in our work , has the form @xmath20 the model is also spin - frustrated . </S>",
    "<S> the classical counterpart of the model ( if one replaces the spin operators by classical vectors ) reveals a long - range magnetic ordering with a nel steady - state configuration , or with a spiral magnetic structure , where the four - spin ring exchange renormalizes the spiral pitch angle as @xmath21 . however , quantum properties of the model with the hamiltonian @xmath22 differ from the one with @xmath19 in a much more drastic way than of their classical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen from the exact solution ( the exactly solvable model was introduced in ref .  ) , which is known for the parametrization of coupling constants @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 for any @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( in what follows we shall consider @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . for @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> the model describes the heisenberg spin-@xmath2 af chain . as one </S>",
    "<S> can see from exact results , the high degeneracy of low - energy states , caused by the spin frustration of nn and nnn interactions , is removed by adding the ring exchange , which is also spin - frustrated . according to the exactly known properties , the ground state of the model eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h2 ] ) depends on the values of the coupling constant @xmath27 and an external magnetic field @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for large values of @xmath31 the model is in the spin - saturated ( ferromagnetic ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase has a trivial long - range magnetic order and gapped low - lying excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it is divided from other phases by the line of the second order quantum phase transition . for low values of @xmath27 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath31 the model is in the phase , which behavior is similar in properties to the phase of the heisenberg spin-@xmath2 af chain in a weak magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite notice that the model is in this phase for @xmath32 even at @xmath33 . at @xmath34 a second order </S>",
    "<S> quantum phase transition takes place . for @xmath35 and @xmath33 the model reveals an incommensurate ordering with nonzero spontaneous magnetization . for nonzero values of @xmath36 and large enough values of @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> the model is in the incommensurate magnetic phase with nonzero weak magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the degeneracy in the direction of the spontaneous magnetization can be removed , if one first puts the system into an external magnetic field , and , then , removes the field . </S>",
    "<S> these two phases are divided from each other by the line of the second order quantum phase transition ( quantum critical point ) .     of the one - dimensional integrable spin model . </S>",
    "<S> at the lines @xmath37 and @xmath38 second order quantum phase transitions to the ferromagnetic ( spin - saturated ) phase , and the ferrimagnetic spiral one , respectively , take place . </S>",
    "<S> in the point @xmath33 , @xmath39 the second order quantum phase transition takes place . at the line @xmath33 for @xmath40 the first order phase transition takes place.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the ground state phase diagram of the one - dimensional integrable model . </S>",
    "<S> the mentioned quantum phase transitions can be observed in the temperature behavior of thermodynamic characteristics of the model , like the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat , that were also calculated exactly . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the goal of our present study is to find how the weak coupling between frustrated spin chains can produce magnetic orderings , and what are specific features of such orderings .    according to the above </S>",
    "<S> , one can suppose two different types of low - temperature magnetic ordering in the quasi-1d system under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> for the first one , the nel ordering , one can write the magnetization of the @xmath41-th site , e.g. , as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the unit vectors in the @xmath27- or @xmath44 directions , @xmath45 is the average magnetization , and @xmath46 is the staggered magnetization in the direction , perpendicular to the external field . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is the 3d generalization of the ground state incommensurate phase of the 1d subsystem , the spiral incommensurate state with the magnetization of the @xmath41-th site , written as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the modulated component of the @xmath44-projection of the magnetization around the average magnetization @xmath45 , and @xmath49 is the wave vector of the 1d modulated structure .    as usually , we study the weak inter - chain coupling @xmath50 in the mean field approximation . in that approximation in the nel phase </S>",
    "<S> we can write the mean field hamiltonian of the 1d subsystem as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath44 is the coordination number . </S>",
    "<S> for the spiral phase the mean field hamiltonian is @xmath53 where @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> renormalization group - like approach @xcite implies that both @xmath55 and @xmath56 are relevant perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> they generate spin gaps @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , for low - energy excitations . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 is the correlation function exponent , see below , which determines the asymptotical behavior of the spin - spin correlation functions of the 1d subsystem in the conformal limit . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the order parameters @xmath46 and @xmath48 ( or @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) have to be determined self - consistently . in the mean field approximation </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding self - consistency equations can be written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the magnetization per site of the 1d subsystem in the effective field @xmath62 and @xmath63 at the temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> then the transition temperature to the ordered state has to be determined from the equation @xmath64 the non - uniform susceptibilities of the 1d subsystem at low temperature can be found as @xmath65\\rangle_{t } \\ , \\label{sus}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the wave vector , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 denotes the thermal average at the temperature @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> asymptotics of the correlation functions for an integrable spin chain can be obtained in the conformal field theory limit . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the model with the hamiltonian @xmath22 it was done in ref .  , </S>",
    "<S> and we can write for the ground state correlation functions @xmath69^{\\theta_z } } + \\dots \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\langle s^x_n s^x_0 \\rangle \\approx ( -1)^n { c \\over [ n^2-(vt)^2]^{\\theta_{\\perp } } } +   \\dots \\ , \\label{corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the fermi velocity of low - energy excitations , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the dressed charge of low - lying excitations , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are nonuniversal constants . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we see , that the symmetry of the ground state is lower than the symmetry of the hamiltonian , caused by the ordering , i.e. for our model one deals with the manifestation of the goldstone theorem . </S>",

    "<S> the fermi velocity and the critical exponent @xmath59 ( or the dressed charge @xmath72 ) can be calculated using the bethe ansatz results . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite then , the question to be answered is : which ordering temperature , @xmath81 or @xmath82 , is higher for the quasi-1d spin chain with the spin frustration ?    in what follows we limit ourselves with the case @xmath33 for simplicity . in this situation </S>",
    "<S> the effective fermi velocity can be written as @xmath83 . </S>",

    "<S> we see that the critical temperature does not depend on @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( obviously , any nonzero magnetic field @xmath89 , or an inclusion of a magnetic anisotropy will change this result ) . to get the @xmath26- and @xmath27-dependences even for @xmath33 and for the magnetically isotropic case </S>",

    "<S> @xcite it is easy to see that for most of the values of @xmath26 , @xmath50 and @xmath27 the temperature of the transition to the spiral incommensurate state for @xmath35 is higher than the nel temperature .     and @xmath97 , which shows how close the quantum critical point @xmath98 is.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in fig .  2 we plotted @xmath81 ( lower surface ) and @xmath82 ( upper surface ) , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 as functions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that @xmath103 is a function of @xmath105 also , but , unfortunately , one can not find this dependence analytically . </S>",
    "<S> notice that for @xmath106 ( @xmath86 , @xmath39 ) both critical temperatures coincide . </S>",
    "<S> the nel temperature can be larger than the temperature of the transition to the spiral incommensurate phase only in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition @xmath107 for @xmath59 being very large ( close to 2 , which seems to be an over - estimation , cf . </S>",

    "<S> hence , we can conclude that for a quasi-1d system , consisting of weakly coupled spin-1/2 chains with af spin - frustrating nn and nnn interactions and with the four - spin ring exchange , the low - temperature ordering depends on the behavior of 1d subsystems . for small values of the nnn interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the quasi-1d system undergoes a transition to the magnetically ordered af nel state . on the other hand , if the exchange constant of the nnn interactions exceeds the critical value , at which a quantum phase transition to the incommensurate state with the weak spontaneous magnetization takes place , a weak coupling between 1d subsystems produces the transition to the magnetically ordered incommensurate spiral state . </S>",

    "<S> we expect that an inter - chain ferromagnetic interaction , @xcite for @xmath84 has to produce the af low - temperature ordering of a special type . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we expect low temperature ordered phase , which consists of ferromagnetic planes with alternating magnetizations of planes . on the other hand , for @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> , a ferromagnetic inter - chain interaction is expected to produce ferrimagnetic low - temperature ordering with a nonzero spontaneous total magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us consider what happens , if one studies the situation with only nn and nnn couplings , without the ring exchange . in that case , for @xmath115 </S>",
    "<S> the quasi-1d system undergoes a phase transition to the nel state , due to weak couplings between chains . for @xmath116 , </S>",
    "<S> a spin gap is opened for low - lying excitations of the 1d subsystem , and the ordering temperature goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this case seems to contradict known experiments , in which magnetic ordering was observed even for @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , we can conclude , that for some real compounds with the properties of quasi-1d spin systems with spin - frustrating interactions in their 1d subsystems some additional spin - spin interactions , like the ring exchange , studied in this paper , probably exist , which close the spin gap and give rise to magnetic orderings at low temperature .    in summary , the ordering temperature of a quasi - one - dimensional system , consisting of weakly interacting quantum spin-1/2 chains with antiferromagnetic spin - frustrating couplings ( or zig - zag spin ladder ) </S>",

    "<S> our results show that the quantum critical point between the two phases of the 1d - subsystem plays an important role . if the one - dimensional subsystem is in the ground state in an antiferromagnetic - like phase , similar to the phase of a spin chain without frustration , weak couplings yield a magnetic ordering of the nel type . on the other hand , for intra - chain spin - frustrating interactions larger than the critical one ( at which the quantum phase transition takes place ) , an incommensurate spiral magnetic ordering of the quasi - one - dimensional spin system takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results of the quantum theory are compared with the quasi - classical approximations . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the calculated features of the magnetic ordering are generic for weakly coupled quantum spin chains with gapless excitations and with spin - frustrating nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions . </S>",
    "<S> while up to now we do not know quasi - one - dimensional systems with nn af spin interactions and large af nnn ones in the spiral phase at low temperatures ( cf . ref .  , </S>",
