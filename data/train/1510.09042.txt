    "the study of ultracold atoms in optical lattices by now has become a major branch of atomic physics  @xcite . in particular , increasing effort is currently being devoted to exert a controlling influence on atoms in optical lattices by subjecting them to a time - periodic external force  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in this fast - growing area have addressed the realization and application of artificial tunable gauge potentials  @xcite , the realization of the hofstadter hamiltonian  @xcite , the observation of effective ferromagnetic domains  @xcite , the realization of the topological haldane model  @xcite , and the creation of a roton - maxon dispersion for a bose - einstein condensate in a shaken optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "these activities indicate that ultracold atoms in periodically driven optical lattices have a high potential for simulating a wide variety of condensed - matter systems and even models of high - energy physics , thereby offering new approaches to long - standing open questions .",
    "the theoretical tool heavily used in this emerging new field is the floquet formalism .",
    "while this is well familiar to researchers working with atoms and molecules in strong laser fields , it does not belong to the traditional training of a cold - atoms physicist .",
    "this has led to a palpable knowledge gap : the ph.d .",
    "student or postdoctoral researcher performing experiments with driven optical lattices requires an easily accessible , sharply focused introduction which should acquaint her or him with the prospects and pitfalls of the general concepts , giving advice how to perform one s own numerical simulations , and thus helping to obtain fresh ideas for specifically targeted further measurements .    the present tutorial article is intended to meet just this demand .",
    "in contrast to excellent recent review articles  @xcite which give a fairly general overview , and explain certain approximation schemes , it is essentially a manual on how to compute , and interprete , the quasienergy band structure of a driven one - dimensional cosine lattice . once the novice has mastered this , it will be found an easy task to adapt these methods to other situations of interest , such as more complicated lattice geometries , or different forms of driving . besides , driven optical cosine lattices are likely to serve as _ the _ workhorses for floquet engineering for years to come , so that the exclusive concentration on this one particular system appears to be well justified .",
    "the material is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s_2 ] we briefly review the calculation of the energy bands of a stationary cosine lattice , in a form that will be taken up again in sec .  [ s_4 ] . before , sec .",
    "[ s_3 ] offers a primer on the floquet theory of periodically time - dependent quantum systems ; this could be read independently of the other parts of this paper .",
    "there we consider a deceptively simple model , the driven particle in a box .",
    "this allows us to introduce and discuss on an elementary level several facets of the floquet picture which also govern , to a higher degree of sophistication , the physics of cold atoms in driven optical lattices . in sec .",
    "[ s_4 ] these tools are combined , and applied to the determination of the spatio - temporal bloch waves which form the backbones of the dynamics in time - periodically driven optical lattices .",
    "we explain the central elements required for numerical computations , and discuss the results of some selected example calculations , hoping that these may inspire the reader to explore still further parameter regimes .",
    "a short outlook given in sec .  [ s_5 ] concludes this tutorial .    a word on referencing : there exists such a wealth of papers on diverse aspects of the floquet formalism that it is impossible to do justice to all of them .",
    "the selection of references made here naturally carries a strong personal bias , and i have to apologize to all colleagues who do not find their works properly cited . but given the availability of modern databases , a mere compilation of who did what might perhaps be found less useful than a certain pre - selection which provides a firm , definite view on the floquet picture .",
    "let us consider a single quantum particle of mass  @xmath1 moving on a one - dimensional cosine lattice oriented along the @xmath2-axis , as described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 here @xmath4 denotes the lattice depth ; in the particular case of an optical lattice @xmath5 is the wave number of the lattice - generating laser radiation .",
    "our first goal is to solve the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath6 and thereby to determine the band structure of this lattice ; this problem has been treated in great detail by slater in the earlier days of solid - state physics  @xcite . to this end",
    "we introduce the dimensionless coordinate @xmath7 , so that the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eve ] ) takes the form @xmath8 here we have sloppily but conveniently written @xmath9 instead of the mathematically correct @xmath10 .",
    "this step allows us to identify the quantity @xmath11 as the relevant energy scale of the problem ; in case of an optical lattice this equals the familiar single - photon recoil energy of the particle  @xcite . dividing , we obtain @xmath12 this is precisely the standard form of the mathieu equation  @xcite , @xmath13 \\varphi(z ) = 0 \\ ; , \\label{eq : mat}\\ ] ] with parameters @xmath14 therefore , the famous stability chart of the mathieu equation , which also determines the parameters of stable ion motion in a paul trap  @xcite , gives essential information on the states of a particle in an optical lattice .",
    "namely , according to the bloch theorem  @xcite the solutions to the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eve ] ) are bloch waves characterized by a wave number  @xmath15 , @xmath16 in bloch s own words , these are `` de broglie waves which are modulated in the rhythm of the lattice structure ''  @xcite , since the functions @xmath17 inherit the periodicity of the lattice potential : @xmath18 in terms of the scaled coordinate  @xmath19 this implies that we are looking for @xmath20-periodic solutions @xmath21 to the mathieu equation  ( [ eq : mat ] ) when considering a band edge @xmath22 .",
    "the opposite edges , where @xmath23 , then give rise to solutions which change sign after one period , @xmath24 , and hence are @xmath25-periodic .",
    "now it is well known that for a given value of the mathieu parameter  @xmath26 , that is , for a given lattice depth , these desired periodic solutions exist only if the other parameter @xmath27 adopts one of the discrete so - called characteristic values @xmath28 , which produce even mathieu functions , or @xmath29 , which belong to odd functions ; while even indices  @xmath30 designate @xmath20-periodic functions , odd indices refer to @xmath25-periodic ones  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a plot of these characteristic values , such as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_1 ] , immediately allows one to read off the width of the energy bands : for @xmath31 , the ( energetically ) lower edge of the @xmath32th band is given by @xmath33 while its upper edge is @xmath34 note that the state with @xmath22 alternates between the lower and the upper edge from band to band .    in order to compute the full dispersion relations @xmath35 of the cosine lattice we insert the bloch ansatz  ( [ eq : bla ] ) into the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : eve ] ) ,",
    "employing the momentum operator @xmath36 thus obtaining @xmath37 this form of the eigenvalue problem is not practical , because here the eigenfunctions consist of both the plane - wave factors @xmath38 and the bloch functions @xmath17 , while one has to impose the periodic boundary condition  ( [ eq : pbc ] ) on the latter only .",
    "therefore , in the spirit of the @xmath39-approach to band structures  @xcite one multiplies this eq .",
    "( [ eq : npr ] ) from the left by @xmath40 and utilizes the identity @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\     & = &      p + \\hbar k \\ ; , \\label{eq : bch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] arriving at @xmath42 multiplying out the squared momenta , this gives @xmath43 this modified eigenvalue equation for the bloch functions alone is much easier to deal with than its antecessor  ( [ eq : npr ] ) , because one now can expand the eigenfunctions with respect to a suitable basis which already incorporates the periodic boundary conditions , then represent all operators in this basis , and diagonalize the resulting matrices numerically .",
    "specifically , upon return to the dimensionless coordinate @xmath7 and division by @xmath44 we have @xmath45 requiring @xmath20-periodic solutions @xmath46 in order to satisfy these boundary conditions we simply choose the basis @xmath47 of normalized @xmath20-periodic trigonometric functions , so that @xmath48 and @xmath49z\\big )       & ; \\ ; \\mu = 1,3,5,\\ldots    \\\\      \\displaystyle      \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\cos ( \\mu z )       & ; \\ ; \\mu = 2,4,6,\\ldots \\ ; .\\\\      \\end{array }      \\right .",

    "( [ eq : evp ] ) , and diagonalize , making sure that the matrix size is chosen sufficiently large so that the desired eigenvalues are converged to the accuracy specified .    in fig",
    ".  [ f_2 ] we show the dispersion relations @xmath35 for the lowest three bands @xmath55 of an optical cosine lattice with depth @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively ; these two examples will be taken up again in sec .",
    "[ s_4 ] for illustrating the engineering options offered by a time - periodic force .",
    "since the lattice period is @xmath58 , the first brillouin zone @xmath59 here ranges from @xmath60 to @xmath61 in @xmath15-space ; if necessary , the dispersion relations outside this interval are obtained by periodic continuation , @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we now put together some elements which are required for the description of quantum systems possessing a discrete translational invariance in time rather than in space . in essence , these go back to the work of the french mathematician achille marie gaston floquet ( 1847 - 1920 ) on linear differential equations with periodic coefficients  @xcite , as does bloch s analysis of the quantum mechanics of electrons in crystal lattices  @xcite .",
    "but there are some peculiarities of time - periodic quantum systems which , although they are known in principle  @xcite , appear to be rarely appreciated , so that this condensed summary may be found useful .",
    "since there are no principal differences between single - particle and many - body systems on this level , we keep this account fairly general .",
    "thus , we consider a quantum system defined on a hilbert space @xmath63 and governed by a hamiltonian which is periodic in time with period  @xmath64 , @xmath65 and we aim at exploring the consequences of this periodicity for the solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath66 here we employ the abstract bra - ket notation for quantum states , so that , for instance , @xmath67 . instead of solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : sgl ] ) for one particular inital condition we desire a characterization of _ all _ its solutions , so that we have to construct the unitary time - evolution operator @xmath68 which effectuates the propagation of any initial state @xmath69 in time  @xcite , @xmath70 this operator @xmath68 itself obeys the schrdinger - like equation @xmath71 with the initial condition @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the identity operator on @xmath63 . for any hamiltonian @xmath74",
    "the time - evolution operator has the physically transparent semigroup property @xmath75 but in the particular case of a periodically time - dependent hamiltonian  ( [ eq : pth ] ) one has even more :    if the hamiltonian @xmath76 is periodic in time with period  @xmath64 , the associated time - evolution operator @xmath68 obeys the identity @xmath77    this says that knowledge of @xmath68 for @xmath78 suffices to construct @xmath68 for all times  @xmath79 .",
    "although this statement may appear `` somewhat obvious '' , it still needs to be proven .",
    "fortunately , this is not difficult : consider the composite operator @xmath80 then , obviously , one has both @xmath81 and @xmath82 thus , @xmath68 and @xmath83 obey the same differential equation with the same initial condition , and therefore coincide , which proves the assertion .",
    "@xmath84    in the following we restrict ourselves temporarily to systems with a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath63 ; this restriction eliminates certain technical subtleties which will be discussed later with the help of a simple example .",
    "just as the translation operator by a lattice vector plays a prominent role in solid - state physics , it is intuitively clear that the one - cycle evolution operator @xmath85 , which is also known as monodromy operator in the mathematical literature  @xcite , must be of particular importance here .",
    "we write this one - cyle evolution operator as an exponential in the suggestive form @xmath86 where the operator  @xmath87 is hermitian , possessing real eigenvalues : this makes sure that @xmath88 is unitary , so that all its eigenvalues lie on the unit circle . with the help of this exponential",
    "we now define a further unitary operator : @xmath89 then one deduces @xmath90 where the basic assertion  ( [ eq : btm ] ) has been used in the first step , and the definition  ( [ eq : dfp ] ) in the second .",
    "thus , we can formulate a second important insight :    under the propositions specified above , the time - evolution operator @xmath68 of a @xmath64-periodically time - dependent quantum system has the form @xmath91 where the unitary operator @xmath92 is @xmath64-periodic , and the operator  @xmath87 is hermitian .",

    ", we then find @xmath101 in the last step made here we have _ defined _ the floquet functions @xmath102 which , as a consequence of the identity  ( [ eq : ppp ] ) , are @xmath64-periodic : @xmath103 for the sake of definite nomenclature we will refer to the states @xmath104 as _ floquet states _ ; note that these states , in contrast to the @xmath64-periodic floquet functions @xmath105 , are solutions to the time - dependent schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) . since the normalized eigenfunctions @xmath106 of @xmath85 form a complete set , and",
    "@xmath107 is unitary , so do the floquet functions  ( [ eq : flf ] ) at each instant  @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we can formulate the content of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tev ] ) as follows :    under the propositions specified above , any solution @xmath109 to the time - dependent schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : sgl ] ) with a @xmath64-periodic hamiltonian @xmath74 can be expanded with respect to the floquet states , @xmath110 where the coefficients @xmath111 do _ not _ depend on time .",
    "@xmath84    the last half - sentence is of central importance for countless applications of this floquet picture : since the periodic time - dependence is already incorporated into the basis , the expansion coefficients remain constant .",
    "this implies that one can assign occupation probabilities @xmath112 to the floquet states which are preserved despite the action of the time - periodic influence , so that several concepts and techniques used for time - independent quantum systems can be carried over to periodically time - dependent ones .",
    "indeed , the phase factors @xmath113 showing up in this expansion  ( [ eq : fex ] ) resemble the factors @xmath114 which accompany the time - evolution of energy eigenstates with energies  @xmath115 if their hamiltonian does not depend on time : the quantities @xmath116 look as if they were energies , and therefore are aptly named _ quasienergies _ ; this designation appears to have been coined in 1966 almost simultaneously by the eminent soviet physicists yakov borisovich zeldovich",
    "@xcite and vladimir ivanovich ritus  @xcite .      in a formal sense",
    ", it seems tempting to interprete the preceding considerations as follows : perform the unitary transformation @xmath117 so that @xmath118 where the overdot means differentiation with respect to  @xmath108",

    "( [ eq : utr ] ) readily yields @xmath121 so that the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ufg ] ) cancels the first term on the right - hand side , leaving us with @xmath122 this looks interesting : the time - independent operator @xmath87 here plays the role of the hamiltonian for the transformed states @xmath123 .",
    "thus , if the transformation  ( [ eq : utr ] ) corresponds to a change of the frame of reference , it works such that the dynamics , as seen from the new reference frame , are governed by a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , this is the guiding principle behind the construction of the floquet solutions to certain _",
    "integrable _ periodically time - dependent problems , such as a two - level system in a circularly polarized classical radiation field  @xcite : in that paradigmatically important example , which will also play a central role for understanding the particular optical - lattice engineering outlined in chap .",
    "[ subsec45 ] , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the usual pauli matrices  @xcite , and @xmath126 denotes the frequency of a transition between the two states of the undriven system @xmath127 .",

    "when viewed from the co - rotating frame , the circularly polarized field must appear as a time - independent one .",
    "indeed , working out the transformation @xmath136 allows one to identify the desired time - independent operator @xmath137 which , upon diagonalization , yields the quasienergies @xmath138 with the generalized rabi frequency @xmath139 moreover , transforming the eigenstates of @xmath140 back to the laboratory frame provides the floquet states of the system  ( [ eq : tlc ] ) .",
    "these results are also useful in an approximate sense when the driving field is linearly polarized , rather than circularly , so that the hamiltonian reads @xmath141 now the linearly polarized field may be regarded as a superposition of two circularly polarized components with opposite sense of rotation .",
    "if one transforms to a frame co - rotating with one of these components , that component appears stationary , whereas the other , counter - rotating component acquires twice its original frequency .",
    "formally this is expressed as @xmath142 where the transformation @xmath107 again is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptl ] ) .",
    "if one now neglects the double - frequency counter - rotating component , hoping that its effects will average out , quasienergies and floquet states of the linearly forced two - level system  ( [ eq : tll ] ) again are provided by the operator  ( [ eq : ogc ] ) .",
    "this is the famous _ rotaing - wave approximation _ ( rwa ) , which obviously constitutes a particular high - frequency approximation  @xcite .    to give another example of an integrable periodically time - dependent system which can be solved by means of a transformation  ( [ eq : utr ] ) we mention the linearly forced harmonic oscillator : here",
    "the floquet states are found by transforming to a reference frame attached to an oscillating periodic solution to the corresponding classical equation of motion  @xcite .",
    "but in general , the remarkable equation  ( [ eq : seg ] ) appears to good to be true .",
    "so where is the catch ?    a first piece of the answer already appears when taking the limit of the quasienergies  ( [ eq : tlq ] ) for vanishing driving amplitude , @xmath143 : then these quasienergies do _ not _ reduce to the energy eigenvalues @xmath144 of the undriven two - level system .",
    "instead , one has to distinguish two cases : if @xmath145 , so that the driving frequency is detuned to the red side of the transition , one finds @xmath146 on the other hand , if the driving frequency is blue - detuned , meaning @xmath147 , one has @xmath148 in either case , what does the additional `` @xmath149 '' mean ?    as the alert reader will have noted when following the general reasoning in the previous chap .",
    "[ subsec31 ] , the _ floquet multipliers _ @xmath150",
    "are well defined , being the eigenvalues of the one - cycle evolution operator @xmath85 .",
    "however , these quantities are just complex numbers on the unit circle which have been parametrized in this particular manner to enforce the suggestive form  ( [ eq : fst ] ) of the fundamental floquet solutions , but they do not uniquely determine the quasienergies @xmath116 : the complex logarithm , which is needed to extract these quasienergies from the floquet multipliers , is multi - valued . since @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is an arbitrary integer , the floquet multipliers thus fix the quasienergies only up to an integer multiple of @xmath153 . introducing the angular frequency @xmath154 a quasienergy , labeled by the state index  @xmath32 ,",

    ", where @xmath156 has to be selected by some suitable convention ; according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : qec ] ) , the quasienergy representative labeled @xmath157 then differs from that @xmath116 by @xmath158 .",
    "for instance , @xmath116 might be that representative which falls into the _ first quasienergy brillouin zone _ @xmath159 , but sometimes other choices are more useful , as in the example discussed in the following chap .",
    "[ subsec33 ] .",
    "this notion of a quasienergy brillouin zone emphasizes the solid - state analogy : just as a quasimomentum of a particle in a periodic potential @xmath160 is determined only up to @xmath161 times an integer multiple of the reciprocal lattice `` vector '' @xmath162 , a quasienergy of a system governed by a @xmath64-periodic hamiltonian @xmath76 is determined only up to an integer multiple of the `` photon '' energy @xmath163 .",
    "hence , the previous result  ( [ eq : tlq ] ) for the quasienergies of a driven two - level system should be written more carefully as @xmath164 thus resolving the question posed after inspecting the limits  ( [ eq : li1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : li2 ] ) .",

    "what is more , in many cases it is not even desirable to single out one particular representative of a quasienergy class  ( [ eq : qec ] ) , because it is precisely the `` @xmath166-indeterminacy '' which allows for a physically most transparent description of multiphoton transitions induced by a periodic drive .      in order to illustrate this important fact , and thereby to prepare the discussion of the physics occurring in driven optical lattices",
    ", we now undertake a small digression and consider the seemingly simple model of a `` periodically driven particle in a box ''  @xcite , which also prompts us to address some practical issues relevant for numerical computation : a particle of mass  @xmath1 is supposed to move on the @xmath2-axis between hard walls located at @xmath167 , as modeled by the unpertubed hamiltonian @xmath168 with the archetypal `` box '' potential @xmath169 which forces the particle s wave function to vanish at @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , the particle is subjected to a sinusoidal force with angular frequency @xmath129 and amplitude @xmath170 , conforming to the total hamiltonian @xmath171 for demonstration purposes we fix the driving frequency such that it is red - detuned by @xmath172 from the dipole - allowed transition between the unperturbed box ground state with energy  @xmath173 , and the first excited state with energy @xmath174 : @xmath175 since the model lives in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath63 , it is actually _ not _ fully covered by the mathematical assertions formulated in chap .",
    "[ subsec31 ] .",

    "we therefore truncate the hilbert space , retaining only the subspace spanned by the @xmath181 lowest energy eigenstates  @xmath176 of the unperturbed operator  ( [ eq : upo ] ) , and then have to deal with a system of @xmath181 complex coupled ordinary differential equations which can be integrated numerically by standard routines . in order to calculate the truncated time - evolution matrix @xmath85",
    "one takes each of the unperturbed box eigenstates as initial condition , @xmath182 , and computes the states @xmath183 resulting after one period , collecting these state vectors as columns of the monodromy matrix .",
    "finally , diagonalizing this matrix yields the finite - subspace approximations to the floquet multipliers @xmath150 as its eigenvalues , and the expansion coefficients of the approximate floquet functions @xmath184 as components of its eigenvectors .",
    "having computed the quasienergy spectrum for suitably chosen @xmath181 , one faces a problem of visualization : if we were to plot all the @xmath181 quasienergies obtained from the diagonalization , reduced to the fundamental brillouin zone , there would be so many data points that one might not be able to recognize the important features , in particular so in cases where @xmath181 is truly large .",
    "in addition , quasienergies resulting from high - lying states close to the `` truncation border '' might not be converged , and therefore should be left out .",
    "but it is not possible to identitify quasienergies of such `` high - lying '' floquet states by their magnitude , because there exists no `` quasienergy ordering '' within the brillouin zone .",
    "a useful ordering scheme can be established by considering the squared overlaps @xmath185 of the eigenvectors @xmath106 of the monodromy matrix with the basis states @xmath186 : if one assigns to each state @xmath187 the index @xmath188 which maximizes that overlap , and then orders the floquet states and their quasienergies with respect to these indices , one obtains at least a good pre - selection of the desired `` low - lying '' states .    in fig .",
    "[ f_3 ] we display a quasienergy spectrum of the driven particle in the box  ( [ eq : pib ] ) which has been computed in this manner with @xmath189 for scaled driving strengths @xmath190 , having plotted only quasienergies originating from the 20 lowest box states .",
    "the reader who is not already familiar with this kind of plot should dwell a moment to absorb its content : because the driving frequency  ( [ eq : rlf ] ) is slightly red - detuned from the transition between the box eigenstates @xmath191 and @xmath192 , these two coupled states constitute a two - level system for sufficiently low driving amplitudes .",
    "thus , the quasienergies originating from these two states should conform to eq .",

    "it might also be worthwhile to point out that the quantum stability problem still remains virtually unexplored for periodically forced systems comprising many interacting particles : in view of the tremendous density of states resulting from folding their unperturbed energy spectra into the brillouin zone , it might be hard to find generic driven many - body systems that are truly stable in the sense of refs .",

    "@xmath325 here amounts to the energy of about four `` photons '' , the driven lowest energy band remains reasonably well isolated from the higher ones at least for low driving amplitudes . in this case",
    "one can resort to a single - band approximation : provided the lattice is so deep that the lowest wannier state localized in one of the lattice wells has appreciable overlap with its nearest neighbors only  @xcite , the unperturbed lowest energy band acquires a cosine form , @xmath335 where  @xmath252 is the lattice constant . in the case of optical cosine",
    "lattices the relative error of this approximation still is on the order of 7% when @xmath56 , and drops to 2% when @xmath57  @xcite .",
    "when an isolated cosine band  ( [ eq : icb ] ) is driven by a sinusoidal force  ( [ eq : sif ] ) the calculation of the resulting quasienergy band becomes elementary , giving  @xcite @xmath336 here @xmath337 is the bessel function of order zero . starting from @xmath338 this function oscillates with increasing real argument  @xmath19 , with an amplitude decreasing as @xmath339 ; its first two zeros are located at @xmath340 and @xmath341  @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the assumptions underlying the single - band expression  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) , a driven energy band in an optical lattice is not isolated , but subject to interband transitions .",
    "hence , the quasienergy band emerging from the lowest energy band incorporates these transitions by acquiring admixtures from higher energy bands . even if the energy gap @xmath325 amounts to the energy of several `` photons '' , so that , perturbatively speaking , it can only be bridged by higher - order multiphoton transitions , this hybridization is non - negligible when the scaled driving amplitude  @xmath331 becomes nonperturbatively strong .",
    "this is precisely what is seen in fig .",
    "[ f_7 ] : for @xmath345 multiphoton resonances still play a minor role , so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : iqb ] ) describes the exact numerical data reasonably well in this interval , in the `` coarse graining '' sense put forward in chap .",
    "[ subsec35 ] .",
    "in particular , an approximate band collapse is observed at @xmath333 , quite close to the predicted value  ( [ eq : cp1 ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath346 the resonances become so strong that the band is almost completely disrupted , so that coarse graining becomes impossible and a second band collapse can not be realized .",
    "the increasing importance of multiphoton resonances with increasing  @xmath331 becomes particularly evident in fig .",
    "[ f_8 ] , where we have visualized the quasienergy dispersion relation of the quasienergy band emerging from the ground - state energy band ; again these plots have been produced by selecting the `` lowest '' three quasienergies for each value of the reduced wave number  @xmath54 . in the upper panel of fig .  [ f_8 ] we have @xmath347 ; here the cosine band  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) is well preserved .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that the coarse graining philosophy is implied already here : lots of ( in fact , infinitely many ) non - resolved anticrossings are tacitly swept under the carpet . in the middle panel",
    "we have @xmath348 , corresponding to the smallest band width found in fig .",
    "evidently the quasienergy band is `` essentially '' flat , but it is already visibly affected by quite a number of narrow resonances .",
    "when @xmath349 the ideal band  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) would be maximally inverted , because the bessel function takes on its largest negative value here .",
    "but , as seen in the lower panel of fig",
    ".  [ f_8 ] , the actual quasienergy band then hybridizes strongly , developing wide anticrossings which render a single - band description useless .",
    "in experimental terms , the widths of these anticrossings quantify the strength of the coupling of the system s wave function to higher states , assuming that it had initially been prepared in the lowest band , and thus determine the time scales associated with heating : while a weakly interacting bose gas in a driven optical lattice remains shielded against heating in the coarse - graining regime for hundreds or thousands of driving cycles  @xcite , it would heat up much faster , and be lost from the lattice , when the resonances start to make themselves felt .",
    "hence , one of the appealing prospects offered by driven optical lattices is that one can easily reach the realm of nonperturbatively strong driving , which would not be accessible in an equally clean manner with laser - driven electrons in crystal lattice potentials , say . the scaled driving amplitude  ( [ eq : bet ] ) is related to the shaking amplitude  @xmath295 entering into the laboratory - frame hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hsh ] ) through @xmath350 so that values of @xmath331 on the order of unity can be reached when  @xmath295 is comparable to the lattice constant  @xmath252 . in this sense , driven optical lattices filled with ultracold atoms may serve as `` strong field simulators '' , allowing one to probe multiphoton transitions in a periodic potential without encountering the many competing charge - induced effects that would mask them in solid - state samples interacting with laser fields of equivalent strengths  @xcite .      if , however , one desires to come closer to the single - band ideal  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) than in the previous example , and to engineer practically flat or perfectly inverted cosine bands , the `` degree of isolation '' of the ground - state energy band has to be enhanced .",
    "this can be achieved , for instance , by increasing the lattice depth , which amounts to an enlargement of the gap @xmath325 , while keeping the driving frequency at its previous value . following that strategy , fig .",
    "[ f_9 ] depicts the `` lowest '' quasienergy band for @xmath57 and @xmath326 . according to table  [ t_1 ]",
    "this implies @xmath351 , so that now more than seven `` photons '' are required to bridge the gap , whereas it had been about four in fig .",
    "consequently one now obtains a quasienergy band which remains more or less intact even up to @xmath352 , with two collapse points at the predicted positions  ( [ eq : cp1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cp2 ] ) .",
    "the validity of eq .",

    "[ f_10 ] : the cosine band starts to narrow when @xmath347 ( upper panel ) , becomes perfectly flat  at least on the scale of fig .",
    "[ f_10 ] ; coarse graining still is implied here !  when @xmath353 ( middle panel ) , and is maximally inverted when @xmath349 ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe how the attempted flattening of a second band at @xmath353 is thwarted by an aligned sequence of broad resonances .",
    "the feasibility of close - to - perfect band inversion in real optical lattices has a noteworthy consequence : a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate occupies the state with @xmath23 when the band is inverted  @xcite , instead of the usual ground state @xmath22 of an undriven cosine band  ( [ eq : icb ] ) .",
    "it also deserves to be mentioned that first indications for band narrowing in periodically driven optical lattices loaded with cold , but non - condensed atoms had been observed in pioneering experiments as early as 1998  @xcite , but the bessel function could not be mapped out cleanly beyond the first collapse point until a decade later through experiments with driven bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .",
    "thus , for carefully selected parameters the quasienergy band which emerges in a sinusoidally driven optical lattice from its lowest energy band is well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : iqb ] ) .",
    "this observation creates a link to the subject of dynamic localization : it had been theoretically discussed already in 1986 that a charged particle moving under the influence of an oscillating electric field on a defect - free single - band tight - binding lattice with equal couplings between neighboring sites remains `` dynamically '' localized when the parameter @xmath238 equals a zero of the bessel function @xmath354 , with @xmath170 denoting the product of the particle s charge and the amplitude of the electric field  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of quasienergy bands  @xcite allows one to understand this remarkable phenomenon within the established concepts of solid - state physics : if one builds an arbitrary wave packet  ( [ eq : wpa ] ) from the spatio - temporal bloch waves which form a quasienergy band  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) and follows its evolution in time , the componets of this packet generally will dephase , so that the packet generally will delocalize , except for those parameters for which the band is dispersionless , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath355 equals a zero of @xmath354",
    ". then all floquet components of the wave packet acquire precisely the same phase factor after each driving cycle , so that the packet reproduces itself perpetually .",
    "hence , dynamic localization results from prohibited dephasing  @xcite .    since the width of an ideal cosine band",
    "is determined by the hopping matrix elements between neighboring sites , the appearance of the bessel function  @xmath354 in the quasienergy band  ( [ eq : iqb ] ) may be interpreted as an effective renormalization of these hopping matrix elements caused by the oscillating force .",
    "this view leads to a number of further applications .",
    "for instance , a tight - binding chain with quasiperiodically varying on - site energies exhibits a metal - insulator transition at a certain critical ratio of the quasiperiodic perturbation strength and the hopping strength  @xcite .",
    "since the driving - induced renormalization of the hopping strength allows one to tune this ratio by applying an oscillating force , one encounters a new mechanism for switching from one phase to the other : the magnitude of the driving amplitude decides whether the system is in the `` metallic '' or in the `` insulating '' phase ; this engineering option can be explored with ultracold atoms in driven bichromatic optical lattices  @xcite . by the same token",
    ", the average extension of anderson - localized states in a randomly perturbed lattice is determined by the ratio of the typical strength of the random on - site perturbation and the hopping strength ; accordingly , the degree of anderson localization can be controlled by an external oscillating force  @xcite .",
    "of particular significance is the recognition that the concept of hopping - strength renormalization survives the presence of interparticle interaction in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "namely , the prototypal quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator undergone by a gas of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice  @xcite is governed by the ratio of the on - site interaction strength and the nearest - neighbor hopping strength .",

    "in contrast , quasienergy band formation can also involve `` vertical '' hybridization when different wannier states localized at the _ same _ site are efficiently coupled by the oscillating force , as is achieved by choosing a matching frequency .",

    "in such cases the quasienergy bands @xmath268 , considered for all instantaneous driving strengths , form `` quasienergy surfaces '' on which the system s wave function can evolve in an effectively adiabatic manner as long as it does not encounter large avoided crossings , whereas it undergoes landau - zener - like transitions at such anticrossings , similar to the pulsed particle in a box examined in fig .  [ f_4 ] . but with pulsed optical lattices such anticrossings would couple quasienergy surfaces only in the vicinity of certain wave numbers , as illustrated by fig .",
    "therefore , one could exploit such anticrossings with driven optical lattices for selectively manipulating only certain components of given wave packets , leaving others unaffected  @xcite .",
    "such pulse experiments could be given a further level of sophistication if they were combined with the feedback - techniques of optimal control , as they are used in chemical physics in order to design specific laser pulses for the coherent control of molecular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in this manner , one could iteratively adapt the pulses properties such that they result , for instance , in the preparation of particularly interesting target states which may not be accessible by more conventional means : instead of `` teaching lasers to control molecules ''  @xcite , one then teaches optical lattices to control bose - einstein condensates .",
    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices so far have created an immensely fruitful link between experimental atomic physics and the physics of condensed - matter systems  @xcite .",
    "it stands to reason that the further investigation of ultracold atoms in time - dependent optical lattices , driven either periodically or by pulses , will add a new dimension to this field .",
    "i would like to express my gratitude to all colleagues and collaborators who have taught me many of the subjects collected here , with particular thanks to heinz - peter breuer , klaus drese , andr eckardt , and stefan arlinghaus .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through grant no .",
    "ho 1771/6 - 2 .",
    "the most time - consuming step in the numerical computation of floquet states and their quasienergies is the determination of the monodromy matrix . by exploiting the symmetries of the quasienergy operator for a sinusoidally driven optical cosine lattice ,",
    "the numerical effort is reduced by a factor of two .",
    "let @xmath383 denote the scaled hamiltonian appearing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : num ] ) , multiplied by @xmath384 , so that the scaled quasienergy eigenvalue equation for the driven lattice takes the form @xmath385 with one period of the dimensionless time @xmath227 having the length @xmath25 .",
    "the quasienergy operator here remains invariant under the combined operation @xmath386 which implies @xmath387 for each floquet eigenfunction .",
    "in particular , this gives the identities @xmath388 now the time - evolution operator for the first quarter cycle , ranging from @xmath372 to @xmath389 , is written as @xmath390 where @xmath391 abbreviate the accompanying phases . using the notation @xmath392 for the trigonometric basis functions  ( [ eq : ba0 ] ) and ( [ eq : bar ] ) , one thus has the matrix elements @xmath393 next , the evolution operator for the second quarter cycle reads @xmath394 where the symmetries  ( [ eq : sym ] ) have been used .",
    "observing now that the basis functions  ( [ eq : tbf ] ) have ( ordinary ) parity @xmath395 , this gives @xmath396 thus , having computed the evolution matrix for the first quarter cyle one deduces its continuation for the second quarter cycle by symmetry ; a corresponding identity connects @xmath397 and @xmath398 .",
