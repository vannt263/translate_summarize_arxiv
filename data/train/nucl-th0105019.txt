    "in the last years one of the main interests in nuclear physics has been focused on the study of halo nuclei , _",
    "i.e. _ , weakly bound and spatially extended systems where one or two particles ( generally neutrons ) have a high probability of being at distances larger than the typical nuclear radii ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a general review on these nuclei ) .",
    "the ability to produce secondary beams of halo nuclei opened new possibilities of investigating their structure .",
    "two basic experimental probes involving high energy reactions have been developed to study halo structure .",
    "the first one is to measure the momentum distributions of the fragments coming out after a collision with light stable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the second probe treats the analysis of coulomb break - up cross section when the nuclei are incident on highly charged targets  @xcite .",
    "the first type of reactions has been treated in detail in a series of publications by the group of aarhus  @xcite .",
    "here , the simplest approach to understand halo nuclei fragmentation reactions involves the instantaneous removal of one of the particles from the few - body halo system . within this approach ,",
    "known as `` sudden approximation '' , one assumes that the binding system is removed without disturbing the motion of the constituent particles .",
    "this approximation is only justified for reaction times much shorter than the characteristic time for the motion of the particles within the few - body system .",
    "the sudden approximation has been extensively applied to the study of three - body halo nuclei , and in particular to the borromean systems , _ i.e. _ , three - body systems where all two - particle subsystems are unbound  @xcite .",
    "final interaction between the two non - disturbed spectators seems to play a crucial role in order to explain the narrow neutron momentum distributions measured .",
    "the participant - target interaction was first described considering only absorption .",
    "further improvements have been included recently , treating the interaction between the target and each of the halo particles by means of a phenomenological optical potential  @xcite .",
    "the total cross section is then obtained by adding the contributions from all the participants in the halo nucleus .",
    "processes where two or three halo particles interact simultaneously with the target are neglected .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the model is only accurate for the outer part of the wave function  @xcite .",
    "this means that those geometric configurations where more than one halo particle get close to the target during the collision should be excluded .",
    "this shadowing effect has been treated in previous works under different approaches . in the analysis of the aarhus group",
    "the shadowing is accounted for by excluding the participant wave function inside spheres around the two spectators  @xcite .",
    "the second type of probe to study the structure of halo nuclei is by means of coulomb elastic break - up reactions with a projectile , composed by a core and valence neutrons , incident on highly charged targets .",
    "the surrey group has studied in detail elastic scattering of halo nuclei from target within the `` adiabatic '' approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , the intrinsic motion is very slow compared to the scattering motion  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interaction between the projectile and the target is described considering only the interaction between the core and the target .",
    "this requirement is relevant to coulomb dominated processes when the core is charged and the valence particle is neutral . in the case that strong interactions dominate , the above requirement is most likely to be valid when the number of core nucleons greatly exceeds the number of valence nucleons  @xcite . within these approximations ,",
    "the elastic differential cross section factorizes into two terms , the cross section for a point - like projectile scattered by the target , and a form factor that contains the effects of the projectile structure .",
    "the range of validity of the adiabatic approximation is also discussed in  @xcite concluding that for a pure strong interaction the adiabatic approach is justified for a given projectile ",
    "target system at sufficiently high energy . on the contrary , in the case",
    "in which the coulomb interaction dominates the validity of the `` adiabatic '' approach is questionable at forward scattering angles .",
    "apart from the approaches mentioned , several other models have been proposed in the literature , starting from the pioneering work of bang and pearson  @xcite , including eikonal  @xcite , semi - classical  @xcite , and mixed approaches to describe direct and sequential break - up  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we develop the formalism of the uncorrelated scattering approximation ( usa ) . here",
    "the basic assumption is to neglect the correlation between the fragments in the region where the interaction with the target is strong . in this situation the orbital angular momenta and kinetic energies of the fragments",
    "are conserved during the collision process , and this leads to an analytic expression for the s - matrix of the composite system in terms of the s - matrices of the fragments . in section 3 we present a preliminary application of the developed approach to the case of elastic and break - up deuteron scattering on @xmath0ni . in section 4",
    "the conclusions are presented .",
    "in this section we introduce a new approach to describe the scattering of a weakly bound nucleus by a heavy target .",
    "as it will be shown later , the s - matrices to the bound and break - up states of the composite system are given in terms of the ground state wave function and the s - matrices corresponding to the interaction of the fragments with the target .",
    "the interaction of a composite particle with the target can be expressed as the sum of two terms .",
    "on one side , an average force acting on the centre of mass of the projectile , which makes the projectile to scatter but does not excite or break it . on the other side , tidal forces that make the projectile rotate ,",
    "excite or break up .",
    "then , when a composite particle scatters from a target there are two opposite effects : i ) the interaction between the fragments tending to keep the fragments bound , and ii ) the tidal forces tending to break the system . in order to simplify our discussion",
    ", we assume that the mass of the target is much larger than the masses of the fragments . the hamiltonian can be written then as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this model",
    ", the interaction between projectile and target can be written as the sum of a folding potential , @xmath4 , which does not affect the internal structure of the projectile , and a tidal potential , @xmath5 , which tends to break the projectile .",
    "the function @xmath6 describes the intrinsic ground state of the projectile .",
    "note that for large distances @xmath7 , the tidal forces , coming from the gradient of @xmath8 , are negligible compared to the force between the fragments , coming from the gradient of @xmath9 , that tend to keep them bound .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to ignore the tidal forces for large distances .    on the contrary , for small distances @xmath7",
    ", tidal forces can be large . in this case a reasonable approach is to ignore the force between the fragments , substituting the potential @xmath9 by a suitable constant @xmath10 . for very tightly bound systems",
    ", tidal forces may not be strong enough to overcome the force between the fragments for any distance @xmath7 .",
    "for these systems , scattering will be predominantly elastic and governed by the folding potential .",
    "however , for weakly bound systems there will be a critical distance @xmath11 below which tidal forces overcome the force between the fragments .",
    "the distance @xmath11 can be associated to an angular momentum @xmath12 , so that @xmath11 is the turning point of the wave - function , fulfilling @xmath13 note that for @xmath14 , tidal forces are not very important because the turning point is beyond @xmath11 . on the contrary , for @xmath15 tidal forces will be important , and the correlation between the fragments may be neglected .",
    "let us consider the situation in which tidal forces can be neglected .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian @xmath16 , approximated by @xmath17 , can be decomposed as follows , @xmath18 the eigenstates of @xmath17 for a total energy @xmath19 can be expanded in terms of products of eigenstates of the internal hamiltonian @xmath20 corresponding to energies @xmath21 , times eigenstates of @xmath22 corresponding to energies @xmath23 .",
    "we make use of a discrete and finite basis of @xmath24 normalizable states of the relative motion of the fragments .",
    "these basis states include the bound states of the projectile and the resonant states of the continuum .",
    "diagonalizing the internal hamiltonian @xmath20 in this basis , one obtains the eigenstates @xmath25 with internal energies @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the energy of the relative motion of the projectile and target in the asymptotic region is @xmath26 .",
    "the states that correspond to energies @xmath27 do not contribute to the wave function asymptotically and , therefore , we restrict our basis space to @xmath28 . the states @xmath25",
    "are characterized by a given angular momentum @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath30 @xmath31 in coordinate and momentum space , respectively .    for the purpose of defining scattering magnitudes , let us consider the hamiltonians free from the interaction with the target @xmath32 , where @xmath33",
    ". the regular solutions of @xmath32 are characterized by a total energy @xmath19 , orbital angular momentum @xmath34 , internal angular momentum of the fragments @xmath35 , total angular momentum @xmath36 and internal energy @xmath21 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents a regular wave function of the free hamiltonian that is just proportional to a bessel function @xmath39 , whereas @xmath40 is the channel wave function in which the internal state with angular momentum @xmath35 is coupled to the relative angular momentum @xmath34 to produce the total angular momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the momentum associated to the relative motion is given by @xmath42 .",
    "if one constructs wave packets out of this wave function , one will have incoming waves for @xmath43 , and outgoing waves for @xmath44 .",
    "the scattering in @xmath45 is such that the incoming waves will be unmodified , while the outgoing waves will be affected by the s - matrix due to the folding potential @xmath46 , which will be diagonal in the channel basis .",
    "let us now neglect the correlation between the projectile fragments .",
    "then , the interaction @xmath9 is replaced by a constant @xmath10 .",
    "the total hamiltonian can be written in terms of two non - interacting hamiltonians @xmath47 the eigenstates of @xmath48 corresponding to an energy @xmath19 can be expanded in terms of the product of eigenstates of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 .",
    "given the adequate boundary conditions , it is straightforward to solve the scattering problem for the hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian free from interactions with the target @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 . a solution of this hamiltonian is given by the product of regular wave functions in the co - ordinates @xmath54 and @xmath55 , characterized by angular momenta @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and energies @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 , the wave function is given by the product of incoming wave functions , while for @xmath61 it is given by the product of outgoing wave functions .",
    "cross terms containing the product of an incoming wave on one co - ordinate and an outgoing wave on the other are cancelled for @xmath62 . then",
    ", if we switch on the interactions @xmath63 , the incoming part is unaffected , while the outgoing part gets multiplied by the product of the elastic s - matrices generated by each potential .",
    "this means that the three - body s - matrix for the hamiltonian @xmath48 is diagonal in the basis characterized by the linear momenta and angular momenta of each fragment , and is given by the product of the s - matrices of each fragment @xmath64 .",
    "a basic point in order to deal with the matching is to realize that the wave functions of @xmath52 can be characterized by the hyper - angular momentum @xmath65 . in a basis of hyper - spherical harmonics ,",
    "the wave functions obtained in the absence of interactions can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , that is proportional to the bessel function @xmath68 , is a regular solution of free three - body problem in terms of the hyper - radius @xmath69 , given by @xmath70 , and the hyper - momentum @xmath71 , given by @xmath72 .",
    "the wave function @xmath73 can be written in terms of the hyper - angle @xmath74 that defines the ratio of @xmath75 to @xmath71 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath76 . explicitly , @xmath77 with @xmath78 a function given in terms of the jacobi polynomials ( see appendix ) .",
    "the hyper - angular momentum @xmath65 provides an upper bound for @xmath34 and @xmath36 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath79 .",
    "thus , if we take a value of @xmath65 given by @xmath80 , we can argue that for @xmath81 tidal forces are less important than the forces between the fragments . on the contrary , when @xmath82 the forces between the fragments will be small compared to the tidal forces .",
    "the relative importance of tidal forces compared to the forces between the fragments depends obviously on the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . however , within the usa approach , such relative importance between both types of forces is basically determined by the value of @xmath65 .",
    "the uncorrelated scattering approximation ( usa ) uses the expansion of the scattering wave function in terms of the hyper - angular momentum @xmath65 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian @xmath16 is approximated by @xmath45 for the components of the wave function such that @xmath81 .",
    "thus , tidal forces are ignored and the scattering is governed by the folding potential .",
    "this means that no excitation or break - up of the projectile occurs in these components . on the contrary , for @xmath82",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 is approximated by @xmath48 .",
    "then , the correlation between the particles is ignored .",
    "it is very important to realize that the usa formulates different approximations for @xmath16 in terms of the value of @xmath65 , and not in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath48 ( @xmath45 ) is the approximate expression of @xmath16 for any @xmath7 , provided that @xmath82 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "it is important to formulate the usa to ensure that the interaction does not couple states with @xmath82 to states with @xmath81 . in order to do that ,",
    "let @xmath85 be the projector on the states with @xmath82 and @xmath86 the projector on the rest of states .",
    "the full hamiltonians @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath87 .",
    "the usa implies that the term @xmath88 is approximated by @xmath89 , while @xmath90 is approximated by @xmath91 .",
    "this ensures that the time evolution of a state @xmath92 is given by the sum of the evolution of @xmath93 and that of @xmath94 , which remain mutually orthogonal .",
    "we can now study what our approximation implies regarding the s - matrix .",
    "we start with a regular solution of @xmath16 and then we construct a wave packet . for @xmath43 the wave packet will be characterized by an incoming wave function times an internal state given by the ket @xmath95 .",
    "the wave - packet for @xmath44 will be a product of outgoing waves times a combination of states @xmath96 , multiplied by certain coefficients , which are the matrix elements of the s - matrix operator between the states @xmath97 and @xmath92 .",
    "then , @xmath98 within the usa model , the hamiltonian @xmath16 is replaced by @xmath45 when referred to states with @xmath81 .",
    "this implies that the operator @xmath99 can be approximated by @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a c - number given by the elastic s - matrix for the calculation involving the folding potential . for @xmath82",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 can be substituted for @xmath48 , implying that the operator @xmath102 can be approximated by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the s - matrix for the hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
    "as we will see in next section , @xmath104 can be expressed in terms of the product of s - matrices of the two particles @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and it remains in the space of states with @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 . finally ,",
    "we can write @xmath108 where @xmath109 . therefore , within the uncorrelated scattering approximation , the s - matrix is given by the sum of two terms : the s - matrix coming from the folding model , which contributes only to the elastic scattering , and a correction term that affects only to the components with @xmath110 , and which contains all the excitation and break - up effects .",
    "this term is given by the difference between the s - matrices of the two uncorrelated fragments and the s - matrix from the folding model .",
    "let us proceed now to describe the boundary conditions .",
    "consider a regular solution of @xmath32 , characterized by a total energy @xmath19 , orbital angular momentum @xmath34 , internal angular momentum of the fragments @xmath35 , total angular momentum @xmath36 and internal energy @xmath21 : @xmath111 can be written explicitly as @xmath112 the channel wave function @xmath40 can be projected with the operator @xmath85 , extracting the components with @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath113^{1/2 }   f^{li}_k(\\alpha(p))^ *   \\tilde \\phi_n(p).\\ ] ]    thus , the asymptotic regular wave function , projected by @xmath85 and written as an eigenstate of @xmath52 , becomes @xmath114 using the raynal - revai transformation  @xcite , the incident wave function can be expressed in terms of the angular momenta associated to the coordinates @xmath83 , @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "the state @xmath117 is a regular solution of @xmath118 for specific values of @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath65 @xmath121 the angular momenta @xmath119 and @xmath120 are separately conserved in the scattering process due to @xmath48 .",
    "however , the hyper - angular momentum @xmath65 , which is a good quantum number for @xmath118 , is no longer conserved by @xmath48 .",
    "thus , one can proceed by using a new basis that keeps @xmath119 and @xmath120 as quantum numbers , but replaces @xmath65 with other quantum number which is conserved by @xmath48 .",
    "note that this hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hbar ] ) conserves the energy , and hence the asymptotic momentum of each particle separately . in the appendix",
    "we show how to transform the states characterized by the values of @xmath65 up to @xmath122 into states that have , approximately , a defined value of the momentum of each particle .",
    "this transformation is achieved in terms of the momentum localized states ( mls ) @xmath123 .",
    "these states depend on the momenta @xmath124 and @xmath125 which are strongly peaked around the values @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "the energies are given by @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the relation between the localized states and the original states is given by means of an orthogonal transformation , @xmath130 , coincides with the number of states with definite @xmath65 , @xmath131 + 1 $ ] .",
    "the coefficients of the transformation are analytic expressions given in the appendix . then , we can write @xmath132 corresponds to a regular wave function in which the two particles @xmath105 and @xmath106 have linear momenta with narrow distributions around @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and angular momenta @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "if we define @xmath135 which is a coefficient that depends on the bound wave functions and on analytic transformation coefficients , we can write finally , latexmath:[\\[\\label{wasymf } p|\\psi_{niljm_j}^{(0)}(e)\\rangle = \\sum_{l_a l_b } \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{n_\\ell } \\langle\\ell l_a l_b|nli\\rangle_j     transformation relates the asymptotic states that define the boundary condition of the scattering problem , with the states for which each particle has a well defined angular and linear momentum . from this expression",
    ", we can construct the incoming and outgoing waves just by making the adequate wave - packets . for @xmath43 , eq .",
    "( [ wasymf ] ) relates the incoming parts of @xmath137 and @xmath138 , while for @xmath44 , it relates the outgoing parts .      within the uncorrelated scattering approximation , the two particles scatter independently inside the interaction region where the full hamiltonian , projected on values @xmath110 , @xmath139 , is replaced by @xmath89 .",
    "the s - matrix is simply expressed in a basis of momentum localized states @xmath138 .",
    "a wave packet of these states at @xmath43 evolves according to @xmath89 to give for @xmath44 , the product of the s - matrices @xmath140 times the wave - packet .",
    "note that in writing this expression , one substitutes the narrow energy distributions of @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the mls state for their central values @xmath141 .    the matrix elements of @xmath142 in the channel basis @xmath143 can be evaluated considering the transformation ( [ wasymf ] ) , @xmath144 with @xmath145 .    in order to evaluate the matrix elements for @xmath146",
    "one should note that the operator @xmath101 is a function of the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 and the energy of relative motion @xmath147 .",
    "it conserves the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 and the internal angular momentum @xmath35 , and is independent on @xmath65",
    ". moreover , the operator @xmath85 conserves @xmath34 and @xmath35 and projects on @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath148 that can be also expressed in the form , @xmath149 where we have used orthogonality properties .",
    "then , the final expression for the s - matrix in the uncorrelated scattering model results @xmath150 with @xmath151 this expression is valid for elastic scattering , inelastic scattering to bound states and break - up to resonant states in the continuum .",
    "we also notice that the expression ( [ eq : s_usa ] ) can be interpreted as the matrix element of the operator @xmath152 , with @xmath153 , between the initial and final internal states .      in the previous section we have derived expressions for the s - matrix elements corresponding to final states , bound or resonant , that can be represented by normalizable wave functions .",
    "they are given in terms of the matrix elements of the operator @xmath154 that is naturally described in the mls basis @xmath155 , in which this operator is diagonal .",
    "thus , only the overlap between the wave function of the final state and the states in the mls basis is required to be known .",
    "the same procedure could be applied to calculate break - up to non - resonant continuum states .",
    "provided that the corresponding wave functions are known in momentum representation , the overlap can be obtained .    in this section",
    "we do not calculate the expressions for the break - up to specific states in the continuum as they should depend on the detailed continuum states wave functions considered .",
    "instead , we derive closed expressions for the non - resonant break - up cross sections , integrated over all the possible values of the energies of the fragments , but characterized by a certain angular momentum of the fragments @xmath156 and of the relative motion @xmath157 .    making use of the completeness relation for the internal eigenstates , it is possible to derive a closed expression for the partial breakup cross section leading from the initial bound state @xmath143 to all the final non - resonant continuum states characterized by the set of angular momenta @xmath158 .",
    "we denote this cross section by @xmath159 .",
    "the details of the derivation are given in @xcite and will be published elsewhere . in this situation the final expression for the partial breakup cross section within the usa is given by    @xmath160    where @xmath161 is the asymptotic incident momentum of the projectile .",
    "this expression has a simple interpretation .",
    "the first term is the cross section induced by the operator @xmath154 to all the states labeled by the angular momenta @xmath162 , that include the contribution of the bound and resonant states , which are explicitly subtracted by the second term .",
    "the summation with respect to @xmath65 is extended to all the values between @xmath163 and @xmath122 .",
    "it is also possible to obtain a compact expression for the breakup cross section corresponding to a total angular momentum @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "this is achieved upon summation of @xmath166 on the angular momenta @xmath157 and @xmath156 and taking into account the completeness property of the states @xmath167 .",
    "this leads to the close expression    @xmath168    then , within the usa , the non - resonant breakup cross section for a given total angular momentum is calculated as the dispersion of the operator @xmath154 in the ground state of the projectile , subtracting the contribution of the other bound and resonant states .",
    "in this section we apply the uncorrelated scattering approximation to the analysis of elastic and breakup scattering of @xmath171 by @xmath172ni . though the usa is expected to work better for more loosely bound projectiles such as @xmath173b or @xmath174be , for which the correlations between the fragments are weaker than for the deuteron , we start studying the case of the deuteron because this is a much better known system for which numerous calculations and experimental data already exist .",
    "the reaction @xmath171 + @xmath172ni has been extensively studied by the kyushu group by means of continuum discretized coupled channel calculations ( cdcc ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been used as a test case of the adiabatic approximation @xcite and the glauber multiple - scattering theory @xcite .",
    "all these approaches predict an important effect of the coupling to the breakup channels that results in a significant departure of their predictions compared to the folding model calculation .",
    "this is a characteristic phenomenon of reactions involving halo nuclei .",
    "therefore , some of the conclusions arising from the analysis of reactions with deuterons can be also extended to the case of exotic nuclei .",
    "we first analyze the elastic scattering data at 80 mev . as already mentioned , the calculation of the elastic @xmath175-matrix elements within the usa requires the following ingredients :    \\i ) the internal wave function of the deuteron . within the usa this wave function enters in both the folding potential and the coefficients @xmath176 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_usa ] ) .",
    "we adopt in this work a simple model of the deuteron which results from the assumption that the proton - neutron potential is separable in momentum space @xcite . in this model the s - wave component of the deuteron ground state is described in momentum space by the simple analytic expression    @xmath177    where @xmath178 is related to the range of the proton - neutron interaction , @xmath179 is the binding energy of the deuteron ( @xmath180 mev ) and @xmath181 is a normalization constant .",
    "we neglect the small d - wave component of the ground state wave function and the proton and neutron intrinsic spins .",
    "\\ii ) the second ingredient of the usa refers to the two - body @xmath175 matrices for the constituents . in the case of the deuteron , the proton - target and neutron - target @xmath182-matrices ( @xmath183 )",
    "are required for values of the angular momenta in the interval @xmath184 , and values of the energies determined by the momentum localized states , which lie in the range @xmath185 .",
    "these @xmath175 matrices have been calculated by means of optical potentials as it is done in the cdcc , adiabatic and glauber calculations . in these formalisms",
    "the proton and neutron optical potentials are evaluated at half of the incident deuteron energy and so , the energy dependence of the optical potential parameters is neglected .",
    "this approximation is based on the assumption that the proton and neutron move approximately with the same velocity of the deuteron center of mass , and the dispersion around this value is small . those configurations for which one of the fragments carry the whole available energy must be highly suppressed . within the usa",
    "this fact is explicitly included in the coefficients , @xmath186 , that can be physically regarded as the amplitude probability of having the constituents of the projectile with angular momenta @xmath187 and @xmath188 , and energies @xmath189 and @xmath190 within a state characterized by the relative angular momentum @xmath191 , internal momentum @xmath192 and total angular momentum @xmath164 . in fact , these coefficients favour those configurations for which each one of the particles carries half of the incident angular momentum and half of the available energy , according to a classical picture .",
    "it is important to note that , within the usa , the energy dependence of the optical potential is naturally taken into account by solving the proton - target and neutron - target schrdinger equations at definite scattering energies .",
    "in particular , we perform the calculations with the optical potentials of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the usa also requires the introduction of two parameters , the average potential , @xmath193 , and the cut - off hyper angular momentum , @xmath194 .",
    "these parameters have a clear physical interpretation and so they could be set to some reasonable values , or otherwise fitted to improve the agreement with exact calculations .",
    "nevertheless , we keep in mind that our purpose in developing the model is to apply it to weakly bound systems for which @xmath194 must be large and @xmath193 small .",
    "then , we have adopted the simplest approach .",
    "we take @xmath194 large enough to achieve convergence for the s - matrix elements .",
    "this means that the correlations between the fragments can be neglected even at large distances . for the average potential",
    "we take @xmath193=0 .",
    "several test calculations have revealed a weak dependence on this parameter .",
    "hence its choice does not affect significantly the results .    the calculated angular distribution of the elastic differential cross section , divided by the rutherford cross section , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dni_e80_elxsec ] .",
    "experimental data are represented by circles .",
    "the dotted line refers to the folding calculation , which clearly overestimates the cross section at intermediate angles .",

    "fig : dni_e80_xsecbuj ] by the thick solid line , shows a fairly good agreement with the cdcc calculation ( dashed line ) @xcite .",
    "apart from the agreement in the overall magnitude , the angular momentum dependence is also accurately reproduced , including the surface - peak nature of the elastic breakup process .    from the results for the partial breakup cross section ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it is clear that the usa predicts an important contribution to the breakup coming from continuum states with internal angular momenta @xmath196 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the convergence of the cdcc calculation for this reaction with respect to the cut - off internal angular momentum .",
    "their calculations reveal a small contribution to the breakup cross section coming from breakup channels with @xmath196 . for example , within the model space @xmath156=0,1,2,4,6 , for which a good convergence of the solution is achieved , the breakup cross section associated to @xmath164=17 is 17.27 mb , whereas the usa predicts a value of 22 mb . we interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the basic approximation involved in the usa , _",
    "i.e. , _ to neglect the correlations between the constituents in the scattering process . in this sense ,",
    "our treatment is opposite to the adiabatic approximation , in which the internal coordinate is assumed to be frozen during the collision , keeping the constituents strongly correlated , and thus avoiding the breakup to high angular momentum states .",
    "this effect could also explain the discrepancy encountered for the differential elastic cross section . in order to provide a numerical assessment of this hypothesis",
    "we have performed a new calculation for the elastic cross section in which the contribution of the continuum channels with @xmath197 has been excluded in an effective way .",
    "we recall that the elastic s - matrix in the usa is given by the sum of two terms , the first one coming from the folding potential and the latter , @xmath154 , which describes dynamic polarization effects due to the coupling to breakup channels .",
    "therefore , this second term arises from the effect of the tidal forces .",
    "however , the tidal potential @xmath198 has vanishing diagonal matrix elements on the ground state of the projectile .",
    "thus , the contribution of break - up states with angular momenta @xmath199 to the elastic matrix elements of @xmath154 ( up to lowest order in the tidal forces ) depends on second order coupling through the expression @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a propagator and the sum extends to the breakup states . in the particular case in which off - shell dependence is removed from the the breakup states involved in the propagator , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq39 ] ) is proportional to the square of the distorted wave integral of the tidal potential .",
    "to lowest order , this term is simply proportional to the break - up cross section .",
    "a restriction in the number of breakup states considered will produce a reduction in the elastic matrix elements of @xmath154 .",
    "the results presented in fig .  2 show that the usa calculation including @xmath202 break - up is correct , whereas the calculation of break - up to larger angular momentum is overestimated .",
    "thus , making use of the proportionality between elastic matrix elements of @xmath203 and the break - up cross section , we get @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the restricted breakup cross section and @xmath206 its associated elastic s - matrix contribution .",
    "the corresponding elastic differential cross section resulting from this prescription , which we call `` restricted '' usa calculation , is represented by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dni_e80_elxsec ] .",
    "the result is in very good agreement with the experimental data , supporting the hypothesis that the strong coupling to high spin breakup states within usa is responsible for the reduction in the elastic cross sections .",
    "if this coupling to high spin states @xmath207 is excluded from the calculation , and the elastic matrix elements are modified accordingly , then both the elastic differential cross sections and the partial break - up are well described .",
    "an interesting question is to assess the validity of the usa at low energies where other models , which are successfully applied to the high energy regime , fail to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this is the case of the sudden approximation and , in particular the glauber model , that can be regarded as a high energy approximation to the adiabatic treatment . to this end",
    "we have applied the usa to the reaction @xmath171 + @xmath172ni at 21.6 and 56 mev , for which experimental data are available @xcite .",
    "we use the same wave function for the deuteron ground state as in the previous calculations .",
    "the perey optical model parameterization  @xcite for protons and neutrons has been selected .",
    "the angular distribution of the elastic differential cross section is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : dni_e56_elxsec ] and [ fig : dni_e22_elxsec ] where we compare the experimental data with the usa result ( thin solid line ) , the usa result considering break - up with @xmath208 ( thick solid line ) , the cdcc calculation ( dashed line ) and the folding model ( dotted line ) .",
    "the results obtained for 56 mev , shown in fig .  [ fig : dni_e56_elxsec ] , are qualitatively similar to the ones for 80 mev ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the full usa calculation displays a too large reduction in the elastic cross section with respect to the folding model prediction .",
    "however , the `` restricted '' usa calculation , which considers only the effect of break - up to @xmath208 , reproduces accurately the experimental data .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dni_e22_elxsec ] we present the results for 21.6 mev .",
    "here there is a fairly good agreement between the full usa calculation and the experiment up to 100 degrees .",
    "it is noticeable that the angular region between 50 and 100 degrees is even better described by the usa model than by the cdcc approach .",
    "the `` restricted '' usa calculation improves the agreement with the experimental data .",
    "these results indicate that the usa is adequate to calculate deuteron break - up cross sections to states with @xmath209 , which are the most important break - up components , although it overestimates the break - up cross sections to deuteron states with @xmath210 . as far as elastic scattering",
    "is concerned , the full usa calculation gives in general , a too strong reduction in the cross sections .",
    "however , the `` restricted '' usa calculation , which takes effectively into account only the effect of coupling to @xmath209 break - up states , reproduces satisfactorily deuteron elastic scattering data at all the energies considered .",
    "although more detailed tests should be required in order to delimit the range of validity of the usa , these preliminary results suggest that the model can be used as an alternative tool to analyze experimental data of halo nuclei at relatively low energies , around and above the coulomb barrier .",
    "we have developed a new approach , called the uncorrelated scattering approximation ( usa ) , applicable to the scattering of weakly bound nuclei .",
    "our first requirement is that the target is very heavy compared with the fragments of the projectile .",
    "although this assumption is not essential to the model it simplifies importantly the general formalism .",
    "the usa arises from the fact that the three - body hamiltonian corresponding to a composite projectile can be written as a sum of two non - interacting two - body hamiltonians in two limit cases : i ) when the tidal forces are neglected , and ii ) when the forces between the fragments of the projectile are neglected . in the first case ,",
    "the projectile remains in its ground state , the interaction with the target is given by the folding potential and the s - matrix is given by the solution of the corresponding two - body scattering problem @xmath211 . in the second case ,",
    "the particles scatter independently .",
    "this means that if the initial wave function is given by the product of incident waves of the particles , the wave function in the final state is characterized by a product of outgoing waves , multiplied by the corresponding s - matrices , @xmath212 .",
    "thus , within the usa one neglects tidal forces in the scattering region corresponding to large separations , whereas in the scattering region , corresponding to small separations , the forces between the fragments of the projectile are ignored .",
    "the regions of large and small separations are defined in terms of the hyper angular momentum @xmath65 .",
    "large separations correspond to @xmath81 , and small separations to @xmath82 , with @xmath122 defined such that its turning point corresponds to a distance @xmath11 for which tidal forces and the forces between the fragments are comparable . for @xmath81 the forces between the fragments dominate , while for @xmath110 tidal forces are more important .",
    "thus , @xmath122 is a parameter of the usa model .",
    "the other parameter , @xmath10 , is a constant that substitutes the interaction between the fragments when @xmath213 .",
    "the proper boundary conditions for the region @xmath82 requires the projection of the initial state in a discrete basis of states which are strongly localized for certain values of the relative momentum of the fragments .",
    "these momentum localized states can be transformed analytically to states which have definite values of the hyper - angular momentum @xmath65 .",
    "then , the raynal - revai coefficients are used to transform the initial states , given in terms of the projectile - target angular momentum @xmath34 and the internal angular momentum @xmath35 , to states that depend directly on the angular momentum of the fragments with the target , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "finally , a certain combination of @xmath65-values is done in order to obtain states with strongly localized values of the kinetic energy of each fragment .",
    "this procedure allows to write the s - matrix of the projectile in terms of the product @xmath212 of the s - matrices of the fragments , evaluated at certain values of the energy and angular momentum of the fragments with respect to the target .",
    "then , the formalism can be applied directly to describe scattering to bound and resonant break - up states , as well as to direct break - up states .",
    "the main advantage of the usa is that it allows to express the s - matrix of the composite system in terms of the wave function of the bound states and the scattering s - matrices of the fragments with the target .",
    "these s - matrices can be easily obtained from calculations that fit the cross sections of scattering experiments of the fragments with the target . in this sense , the fragment - target interaction is treated to all orders , and the only assumption one makes on the reaction dynamics is to neglect the correlation between the fragments .",
    "thus , the usa approach presents some advantages compared with previous treatments .",
    "effects of absorption or `` shadowing '' , which are included by means of @xmath214 profile functions in some spectator models @xcite , appear naturally here , as occurs in glauber approaches @xcite , because the s - matrices @xmath215 and @xmath216 of the fragments include the effects of absorption for low @xmath119 and @xmath120 values . compared with semi - classical approaches @xcite , the usa does not make use of the concept of classical trajectories for the relative motion . compared with glauber analyses @xcite , the usa justifies the expression of the three - body s - matrix in terms of the product of the s - matrices of the fragments from very general considerations , that do not require to make use of the eikonal assumption of forward scattering , or straight line trajectories . also , our expressions depend on the s - matrices of the fragments evaluated at integer orbital angular momenta , while previous glauber - type approaches rely on evaluating by interpolation the s - matrices of the fragments as a function of real impact parameters , which would correspond to non - integer l - values .",
    "finally , the usa also differs from glauber - type approaches , and other approaches based on the adiabatic approximation , for which the velocity of all the fragments with respect to the target is equal to the projectile velocity , and so the energies of the fragments are fixed quantities proportional to the masses . in the usa , the relative energy of the fragments with respect to the target , @xmath217 , @xmath218 can take different values , reflecting the fact that in the incident projectile the fragments have a certain momentum distribution . as the usa does not make use of the eikonal approximation , which is essentially a forward - scattering approach",
    ", we consider that it can be useful when applied to scattering of weakly bound halo nuclei at low scattering energies , comparable to the coulomb barrier .    apart from the theoretical formulation of the usa",
    ", we have also presented a preliminary application of the approach to the reaction @xmath219+@xmath0ni at 21.6 and 80 mev .",
    "the parameter @xmath122 is set to a large value , and @xmath10 is taken as zero .",
    "this corresponds to neglect completely the effect of proton - neutron correlation in the scattering .",
    "concerning elastic scattering at 80 mev , the usa gives rise to a depletion of the cross sections at intermediate angles with respect to the folding model prediction .",
    "the experimental data and the cdcc calculations also show this depletion , although not so large as in the usa model .",
    "the break - up cross sections at 80 mev to @xmath220 and @xmath221 states in the usa approach is consistent with the cdcc calculation .",
    "however , break - up cross sections to @xmath222 states , which are sizeable in the usa , are strongly suppressed in the cdcc calculations . when the usa calculation of the elastic scattering is modified to exclude effectively the coupling to @xmath222 states ,",
    "the experimental differential cross sections and cdcc calculations are very well reproduced . using the same procedure for the elastic cross sections at 21.6 and 56 mev ,",
    "the experimental data are also accurately reproduced .",
    "our interpretation of these results for deuteron scattering is that the proton - neutron correlations , which are neglected in the usa calculation , play a significant role .",
    "these correlations show up in the evaluation of break - up cross sections to @xmath222 states . within the usa model , the proton and neutron scatter independently from the target , and so , after the scattering they have a certain probability to end up in a state with large relative angular momentum . however , in reality the proton and neutron remain correlated , and this correlation suppresses large @xmath199 break - up components in the wave function .",
    "once these components are excluded , both elastic and break - up cross sections are well reproduced by the usa calculation .",
    "we expect that , for the scattering of halo nuclei at energies around the coulomb barrier , the effect of the correlations between the fragments will be less important than in the case of deuteron .",
    "thus , the uncorrelated usa calculation will be more reliable and we may expect to see more clearly the features of the usa calculations .",
    "these include an important decrease of the elastic cross section with respect to the folding model prediction , and sizeable contributions to break - up with large angular momentum between the fragments .",
