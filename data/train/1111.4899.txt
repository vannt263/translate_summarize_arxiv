    "could some features of experimental systems as dissimilar at a microscopic level as superconductors , magnets , ferroelectrics , fluids , paper , or two - dimensional electron gases , be described by the same equations at a macroscopic level ?",
    "all those systems may actually display emergent structures such as _ interfaces _",
    "( e.g. ferroelectric @xcite or ferromagnetic @xcite domain walls , contact line in wetting experiments @xcite or propagating cracks in paper and thin materials @xcite ) or _ periodic systems _ ( typically vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , classical @xcite or quantum @xcite wigner crystals , or electronic crystals displaying charge or spin density waves @xcite ) .",
    "one can either describe them using _ ab initio _ predictions combined to a landau approach , where two phases compete with each other at their common boundary ( the complexity of a numerical approach increasing considerably with the system size ) , or rather take a radically opposite point of view by skipping the specific microphysics and focusing exclusively on the boundary , defined by the shift of the order parameter .",
    "such an emergent structure can then be described as a fluctuating manifold or periodic system supported by a disordered underlying medium , in the generic framework of _ disordered elastic systems _ ( des ) .",
    "thereafter we recall briefly the basic features of des by giving first a short recipe of a des model based on two competing physical ingredients : elasticity and disorder , blurred by thermal and/or quantum fluctuations",
    ". then we list the main observables of interest in order to probe the disorder - induced metastability present in those systems , and to address the two main questions which arise regarding their resulting glassy properties : what can we learn by the study of its statics _ versus _ its dynamics , first via the characterization of its geometrical fluctuations and secondly via its response to an external force ?    indeed , from the 1970s and larkin s work @xcite , we know that there could not exist a perfectly ordered solid in presence of disorder , so how does the addition of disorder change the nature of a pure system ? finally we focus on a particular low - dimensional des and study the static geometrical fluctuations of a one - dimensional interface , via an analysis of the interplay between thermal fluctuations and a finite width of the interface in its roughness .",
    "those short notes are not meant to be exhaustive , but rather to give a pedagogical and somehow practical introduction to the field , aimed at theoreticians but also at experimentalists who might be interested in des modeling .",
    "we focus essentially on the case of _ interfaces _ , but most concepts can be extended to _ periodic systems _ , and more details and references can be found for example starting from the existing reviews @xcite .",
    "in the generic framework of des , very few physical ingredients are required in a minimal version of such a model .",
    "thereafter we briefly sketch their concrete implementation for interfaces , but those considerations remain valid for periodic systems @xcite .      first of all one has to identify the _ dimensionality _ of the system ( @xmath2 being the internal dimension of the system , @xmath3 the number of its transverse components , and @xmath4 the dimension of its embedding physical space ) and whether it is a _ manifold _ ( @xmath5 with @xmath6 for interfaces ) or a _",
    "periodic system_.    for example , a 1d interface and a single vortex are manifolds respectively with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , whereas an abrikosov vortex lattice and a 3d wigner crystal are periodic systems with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "note that the dimensionality and the class of des might actually change with respect to some parameters of the system , as it can been addressed experimentally e.g. for ferromagnetic domain walls ( 1d to 2d interfaces crossover ) @xcite or for vortices in superconductors ( vortex lattice to individual vortices ) .",
    "the description of the physical space embedding the des can then be split in two sets of coordinates : @xmath12 denotes the _ internal _ coordinates of the system ( e.g. the position along a polymer or a given point in a lattice ) , and @xmath13 its _ transverse _ coordinates .    for an analytical treatment of interfaces",
    "we typically assume that they live in an _",
    "infinite _ and _ continuous _ physical space so @xmath14 is taken as @xmath15 . however , a physical or numerical realization of such a system is always supported by a _ microscopically discrete _ sublattice of parameter @xmath16 , ultimately the crystal in a solid , and moreover lives in a _ finite _ box of typical size @xmath17 with boundary conditions which have to be defined ( possibly periodic or free ) .",
    "so in the comparison between analytical predictions and experimental or numerical results , corrections due to finite size effects and to the translation from the discrete to the continuous limits are _ a priori _ expected .",
    "once the disorder is averaged out , a translational space - invariance is recovered , suggesting a description in fourier space @xmath18 with an ultra - violet @xmath16 and an infra - red @xmath19 cutoffs , which are always present in physical des . however , from an analytical point of view , they are either irrelevant and thus skipped , or they are conveniently reintroduced in order to cure non - physical divergences in computations .      in the absence of disorder",
    ", an elastic system tends to minimize its distortions , thus would typically be flat for an interface or characterized by a single reciprocal vector for periodic systems .",
    "a given configuration of a des is characterized by a _ univalued displacement field _",
    "@xmath21 with respect to such an equilibrium configuration ( e.g. flat or periodic ) of the pure system as illustrated in fig.[fig - def - uz - dm1 ] .",
    "the definition of this reference configuration is actually crucial but potentially tricky in experiments , in particular in certain cases where the equilibrium configuration is not a straight line .",
    "for example , how to define unambiguously the center and the mean radius of a ` dotted ' ferromagnetic domain if it is far from being perfectly circular ?     for a 1d interface ( @xmath22 ) superimposed over its surrounding smooth random potential @xmath23 ( in a weak disorder limit ) .",
    "@xmath24 is univalued only in the absence of bubbles or overhangs for interfaces.,width=302 ]    defects such as overhangs and bubbles for interfaces , or topological defects in periodic systems are still missing in the above des description , since they hinder the definition of a univalued displacement field @xmath24 , at the core of the concrete implementation of statistical averages both thermal and over disorder .",
    "the elastic energetic cost of distortions ( @xmath25 ) is given by the elastic hamiltonian @xmath26}}$ ] .",

    "nevertheless the elasticity can also be effectively _ long - ranged _ , as it is the case e.g. for contact lines in wetting experiments because of the fluid surface tension @xcite .",
    "the effective energy per fourier mode is then @xmath33 with @xmath34 , or the elastic hamiltonian can include phenomenological additional terms as e.g. for the description of the out - of - equilibrium depinning regime ( cf .",
    "section [ section - dynamics ] ) @xcite .",
    "the ` disorder ' accounts for the effects of the inhomogeneities inherent to any real physical medium , and it is defined as a stochastic variable @xmath23 with a given statistical distribution @xmath35}}$ ] and the _ ad hoc _ disorder average ( denoted @xmath36 for an observable @xmath37 ) . it adds a random part to the des hamiltonian @xmath38 with the disorder hamiltonian @xmath39 }   = \\int_{\\mathcal{d}_z } d^d z \\cdot v(\\vec{z},\\vec{u}_z )   \\label{equa - hdis}\\ ] ]    first , if this stochastic variable has a dynamics much slower than the dynamics of the des , the disorder is _ quenched _ ( as e.g. atomic terraces on thin epitaxial films ) otherwise it is _ annealed _ ( as e.g. itinerant oxygen vacancies in superconductors ) .",
    "that distinction essentially imposes the sequence of disorder and thermal averaging of observables in computations .",
    "secondly , disorder can either be dominated by a few individual pinning centers in the _ strong disorder _",
    "limit , or by many weak impurities in the _ weak disorder _ limit . in the latter case ,",
    "the collective behavior of the impurities conspire ( by the central limit theorem ) to give rise to a smooth random potential @xmath23 , as illustrated in fig.[fig - def - uz - dm1 ] , with a gaussian distribution @xmath35}}$ ] .",
    "note however that this ` weak disorder ' limit can be realized in experimental des only because the disorder can actually vary on characteristic lengthscales which are much smaller than the lengthscales of interest of the des description such as the lattice spacing of periodic systems ( as e.g. for the 3d macroscopic wigner crystal in colloids @xcite ) .",

    "if this correlator decreases sufficiently fast , then the disorder is short - ranged or _",
    "random - bond _ ( rb : the interface couples only locally to the surrounding disorder ) , else it is long - ranged or _ random - field _ ( rf : the system is sensitive to the disorder in all the physical space ) . in the section [ section-1dinterface ]",
    "we examine specifically what are the consequences of a finite rb disorder correlation length @xmath45 on the static properties of a 1d interface .",
    "of course in an experimental system all types of disorder could be present , but the dominant disorder defines its universality class .      at last , the internal structure of physical des can be crucially relevant for its properties , and it is actually already partially encoded in the disorder correlator and its correlation lengths @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the implications of an _ internal degree of freedom _ , as e.g. the phase shift in nel _ versus _ bloch domain walls , are challenging theoretically , but such an additional physical ingredient in des modelling might be needed to account for the physics of experimental systems , as it has been recently addressed in the context of spintronics nanowires @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two basic questions that can be addressed regarding des and their experimental realizations : how do they look like and how do they respond when one pulls on them . by comparing the theoretical and numerical predictions of generic des to measurements on experimental setups ,",
    "it is possible on one hand to test the adequacy of a des modelling , and on the other hand to identify the universality class of dimensionality , elasticity and disorder of a particular physical realization , and then to extrapolate to its other possible disorder - conditioned features .    from an analytical point of view",
    ", the competition between elasticity , disorder and thermal / quantum fluctuations is treated via two statistical averages of an observable @xmath37 , respectively the thermal / quantum average @xmath48 and the disorder average @xmath36 .",
    "the two underlying assumptions to this procedure are the _ ergodicity _ and a _ self - averaging disorder _ , which imply essentially that the computed quantity @xmath49 should match the measurement of the observable @xmath37 on an equilibrated and sufficiently large experimental sample ( here with quenched disorder ) .",
    "thereafter we discuss briefly the statics and the dynamics of des , and then we mention the main methods used to tackle them . for short pedagogical reviews on the subject and further references ,",
    "see @xcite .      in statics",
    "the main information that can be accessed experimentally is the configuration of the system , described by the displacement field @xmath24 defined with respect to a given reference configuration ( which is somehow arbitrarily chosen ) as in fig.[fig - def - uz - dm1 ] .",
    "the geometrical fluctuations of @xmath24 can be quantitatively characterized by the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the relative displacements @xmath50 at a given lengthscale @xmath51 .",
    "assuming rightfully a translational invariance after disorder - averaging , this pdf @xmath52 can fairly enough be approximated by a widening gaussian @xcite as illustrated in fig.[fig - relative - displacements ] , and its main feature is thus its variance , namely the _ roughness function _",
    "@xmath53 or its corresponding _ structure factor _",
    "@xmath54 : @xmath55 } s(\\vec{q})\\ ] ] those quantities are thus the mere two - points correlation functions of @xmath24 and its fourier transform , for which we are hopefully well - equipped for an analytical treatment . moreover , if the system displays a scale invariance on a whole range of lengthscales , it is expected to behave logarithmically or rather as a power law @xmath56 or @xmath57 defining the _ roughness exponent _ @xmath58 .     for a 1d interface and their translational - invariant pdf @xmath52 after the disorder average . if @xmath52 is gaussian , its main feature is its variance @xmath59 , namely the interface roughness as a function of the lengthscale.,width=302 ]    for periodic systems , the displacement field is again defined with respect to a reference ` equilibrium ' configuration , this time a lattice of reciprocal vector @xmath60",
    ". the analogous quantity to the roughness is then the _ translational order correlation function _",
    "@xmath61 defined as : @xmath62 and its fourier transform the structure factor @xmath63 .",
    "if the theory is close to a gaussian as in @xcite , it is actually simply related to the roughness since we have then @xmath64}}$ ] .    in practice , in order to measure the roughness and its related quantities , one has first to take a picture ( a ` snapshot ' ) of the system , then chose a reference configuration ( typically flat for an interface or a perfect lattice for periodic systems ) and define the corresponding displacement field @xmath20 , and finally compute the appropriate functions @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 . in a logarithmic representation ,",
    "the roughness usually exhibits a power - law ( or logarithmic ) behavior @xmath68 up to a certain lengthscale above which it saturates ; the main focus then is on the value(s ) of the corresponding roughness exponent(s ) @xmath69 , as a signature of dominant physics at a given lengthscale range depending on the universality class to which the system belongs .",
    "there are however other important features also at our disposal to probe the disorder - conditioned properties of the system , such as the power - laws prefactors and their possible temperature - dependence e.g. @xmath70 ( with the _ thorn _ exponent ) , the crossover lengthscales including the saturation lengthscale itself and last but not least the possible non - gaussianity of the pdf @xmath71 ( that could then be due to finite - statistics artefacts or to a physical origin ) @xcite .",
    "the special case of a 1d interface with a short - ranged elasticity and a rb disorder is discussed at length in the section [ section-1dinterface ] .",
    "such an analysis is of course also possible in order to study the dynamical geometrical fluctuations of the system , but that requires a time - resolved measurement technique , and the possibility to take an actual snapshot of the system , which is not always the case ( e.g. for surface - scanning techniques such as the scanning tunnelling microscopy or atomic force microscopy ) .",
    "the knowledge of the statics of a disordered system is not a sufficient criterion to decide on its glassiness , since it may look quasi - ordered despite the disorder ( as e.g. periodic des displaying power - law decaying bragg peaks ) . because of its disorder - induced metastability",
    ", it may moreover be difficult to even discriminate equilibrium from out - of - equilibrium configurations , so it is necessary to study specifically the dynamics of the system .",
    "the characterization of the response of a disordered system under an external force is fundamental for applications , and is thus widely studied in experimental setups . applying an external force on a des , such as an external magnetic field on a ferromagnetic domain wall or an electrical current on a vortex lattice in a type - ii superconductor ,",
    "it is indeed possible to set those systems into motion , which is highly non - trivial since they are after all emergent structures defined by a shift of the order parameter .",
    "for example , an external magnetic field favors a given magnetization direction , makes the favored ferromagnetic domains grow and thus displace the boundaries between the different phases , thus the domain walls effectively move .",
    "ideally we would like to have access to the whole time - resolved displacement field @xmath72 , as in numerical simulations but also in experiments such as e.g. the imaging of the imbibition line of a fluid on a disordered substrate @xcite , of a crack front along an heterogeneous weak plane @xcite by ultra - fast ccd camera , or of avalanches in ferromagnetic thin films @xcite .",
    "the quantities of interest , beyond the displacement field itself @xmath72 , are usually the position of its center of mass @xmath73 , its velocity @xmath74 and the fluctuations of the velocity @xmath75 itself . however , for a complete characterization , the geometrical fluctuations around the center of mass @xmath76 should also be addressed , with the pdf of the _ ad hoc _ dynamical relative displacements at fixed time @xmath77 and its corresponding variance @xmath78 , structure factor @xmath79 or higher moments similarly to the statics .     as a function of a constant external force @xmath80 .",

    "the picture is superficially similar to that of a critical phenomenon , with the steady - state velocity @xmath84 as an order parameter , the driving force @xmath80 as the controlling parameter and the disorder - dependent critical force @xmath85 .",
    "below @xmath85 the des might relax from a given configuration with a transient velocity @xmath86 @xcite , but then it is stuck so @xmath87 .",
    "above @xmath85 it acquires a finite steady - state velocity @xmath88 through the disordered energy landscape , which actually takes off with a critical _ depinning _ exponent @xmath89 . with a finite temperature ,",
    "there are thus three regimes of interest for the thermal effects on the dynamics : first the _ depinning _ regime at @xmath90 with a possible thermal - rounding power law @xmath91 @xcite ; secondly the _ large velocity _ regime at @xmath92 where @xmath93 which defines the friction coefficient @xmath94 of the des , and the possible characterization of the nature of this moving phase via its dynamical geometrical fluctuations ; and finally the _ creep _ regime at @xmath95 where thermal fluctuations allow the system to explore the disordered energy landscape and overcome some of its barriers .    if there was only one characteristic energy barrier @xmath96 , the response of the system to a very small driving force would be linear @xmath97 ( ` thermally assisted flux flow ' ) .",

    "however the content of the typical energy @xmath105 and depinning force @xmath85 is still an open question .",
    "the single - crossover scenario predicts @xmath106 the typical energy barrier at the lengthscale @xmath99 and @xmath107 the depinning force of a larkin domain , with @xmath108 the width of the interface , but this prediction has not been reproduced yet in numerics even for the 1d interface .      in statics , a given configuration with a displacement field @xmath109 is weighted by a boltzmann weight @xmath110}/t } } $ ] ( with the boltzmann constant @xmath111 so that the temperature @xmath82 has actually the units of an energy ) , whereas in dynamics the hamiltonian @xmath112}}$ ] is replaced by a martin - siggia - rose action constructed from a langevin equation for the time - evolution of the displacement field @xmath72 .",
    "the statistical averages @xmath113 for the observables @xmath37 listed in the previous sections are then computed analytically with respect to those statistical weights .",
    "pure scaling arguments on the statistical averages of observables , via the scaling of the hamiltonian , of the disorder distribution , of the langevin equation or of the action , can yield very powerful predictions yet they have to be interpreted carefully , and can often provide a rather _ a posteriori _ short explanation of otherwise painfully computed results .",
    "for example , the flory or imry - ma ` mean - field ' argument provides a value @xmath114 quite close to the exact physical roughness exponent @xmath58 .",
    "the two main analytical tools used on des are on one hand the _ functional renormalization group _ ( frg ) where the whole disorder correlator evolves under the renormalization procedure @xcite , and on the other hand the _ gaussian variational method _ ( gvm ) as introduced by mzard and parisi on des , and involving _ replica _ to treat the disorder @xcite .",
    "numerically there are in particular very efficient algorithm in 1d in order to address the dynamics and the static of the 1d interface , starting from a _ langevin equation _ both at zero @xcite and at small but finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in this section , we focus on the particular case of the 1d interface in quenched rb disorder , as an illustration of a des modelling , of the computation and interpretation of the static roughness function via gvm and scaling arguments , and of the link to the quasistatic creep regime .",
    "the study of the 1d interface is at the crossroad between a fundamental interest in the peculiarities of low - dimensional systems , several mappings on related statistical - physics problems in the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class ( including the 1 + 1 directed polymer ( dp ) ) @xcite , and experimental realizations of effective 1d interfaces such as ferroic or ferromagnetic domain walls ( dw ) in thin films .",
    "a first example of such experiments are dws in ferroelectric thin films of pb(zr@xmath115ti@xmath116)o@xmath117 which display out - of - plane polarized domains , written and probed by atomic - force - microscopy technique @xcite .",
    "this imaging technique probes by definition the surface of the film , which is however sufficiently thin ( typically 50 - 60 nanometers ) so that the measured dws are effective 1d interfaces convoluted on the whole thickness of the film . a second example , which is believed to be a prototype of the des model presented thereafter , are ferromagnetic dws in ultrathin films of pt / co / pt ( just a few atomic layers ) with out - of - plane magnetization domains @xcite .",
    "the internal structure of those dws have not been accessed , since their typical width ( respectively a few unit crystal cells and @xmath118 nm ) is still below the resolution ( respectively nanometric and micrometric ) , along with their transverse geometrical fluctuations at comparable small lengthscales . however , even though their static roughness can not be observed at sufficiently small lengthscales yet , it could have indirect consequences on their quasistatic dynamics . indeed , in order to obtain the phenomenological creep formula ( cf .",
    "section [ section - dynamics ] ) , the main assumption is that there is a _ single _ characteristic lengthscale in the statics ( the larkin length @xmath99 ) which coincides with the typical size of avalanches in the quasistatic dynamics .",
    "the scaling prediction for the creep exponent worked surprisingly well in ferromagnetic dws @xcite for the roughness and creep exponents @xmath58 and @xmath119 ( cf .",

    "the main consequence of the interplay between a finite @xmath134 and a finite @xmath135 on the 1d interface geometrical fluctuations is the existence of two regimes in temperature for its static roughness .",
    "those two regimes are separated by the single characteristic temperature @xmath136 which naturally involves all the scales at stake in the des model .",
    "physically this can actually be understood by a comparison between the microscopic width @xmath108 and an effective width @xmath137 due to thermal fluctuations . at high temperature ( @xmath138 )",
    "the thermal fluctuations erase the existence of the microscopic width ( @xmath139 ) , so with the only two remaining scales @xmath140 one can define a single characteristic lengthscale @xmath141 , presumably the unique crossover between two roughness regimes ( purely thermal at small - lengthscales and dominated by disorder at large lengthscales ) . on the contrary , at low temperature ( @xmath142 ) @xmath143 so the microscopic width matters and there is a whole intermediate roughness regime which leads to the definition of at least two characteristic crossover lengthscales @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the latter marking the entrance in the asymptotic random - manifold regime dominated by disorder .",

    "in order to go beyond those scaling predictions and to have an explicit roughness function @xmath170 connecting all the lengthscales at @xmath135 and @xmath134 , we have computed it in full details in the reference @xcite in a gaussian variational method ( gvm ) , compatible with the fairly gaussian distribution @xmath171 observed in numerics @xcite .",

    "we first used the so - called ` replica trick ' , well - known in the study of spin glasses @xcite , in order to average first over the disorder and so to transform the random part @xmath173 in the full hamiltonian of one interface ( @xmath174 ) , into an effective non - random coupling between @xmath175 copies of the interface ( @xmath176 ) , in the overall peculiar limit of @xmath177 .",

    "this leads to the following roughness function as a function of the lengthscale @xmath184 , illustrated in fig.[fig-4b - prb2010 ] : @xmath185 all the @xmath108-dependence is actually contained in the full - rsb cutoff @xmath186 since @xmath187 . at low temperature",

    "so the gvm predicts on one hand the flory exponent @xmath195 instead of the exact rm roughness exponent @xmath196 ; and on the other hand temperature - independent fluctuations at large lengthscales in contradiction with the high-@xmath82 scaling argument ( except if we assume temperature - dependent microscopic parameters @xmath197 ) .",
    "an alternative to this gvm computation on a full des model is to use the exact mapping of the 1d interface on the 1 + 1 directed polymer @xcite , in order to construct an effective ` toy model ' _ containing additional physical ingredients in a controlled way at a fixed lengthscale _ , and only then to perform the gvm approximation for the roughness .    assuming",
    "as always that there is no overhangs nor bubbles , a segment of length @xmath184 of the 1d interface @xmath198 can be seen as a directed polymer with one extremity fixed at the origin @xmath199 , growing in ` time ' along a trajectory @xmath200 , until a time @xmath201 identified with the lengthscale @xmath184 . with the translations @xmath202 and @xmath203 , the geometrical fluctuations of the 1d interface at a given lengthscale @xmath184 are mapped to the dp s endpoint fluctuations at a fixed time @xmath201 , @xmath204 and so their variance define the same roughness function : @xmath205 in the absence of disorder , the polymer draws a brownian random walk and the probability distribution of its endpoint is a pure gaussian given by @xmath206 where the pseudo - free energy @xmath207 is the corresponding term to the elastic hamiltonian . the rb disorder explored by the dp translates into an effective free energy @xmath208 such that @xmath209 , and defined as an integrated random phase @xmath210 in a ` random - field ' effective formulation : @xmath211 as the corresponding term of the disorder hamiltonian , we assumed that at fixed @xmath201 this effective disorder is gaussian , i.e. @xmath212}}$ ] and @xmath213}}$ ] are fully defined by their mean value and their two - point correlator .",

    "the large arrows show the displacements of the curves with an increasing temperature @xmath82 , coupled with a gradation from blue to red curves.,width=302 ]    this second gvm procedure is actually carried out _ at fixed ` time ' @xmath201 _ , so a priori with ` time'-dependent effective parameters @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "we can nevertheless assume that first the disorder correlation length for the dp is essentially the same as for the microscopic random potential i.e. @xmath227 , and secondly that @xmath218 is given by the constant @xmath224 as in , compatible with the high - temperatures ( or zero - width ) scaling argument .",
    "this last choice becomes however clearly unphysical in the limit @xmath228 , and in fact a similar scaling argument on the dp toy model suggests that at low temperatures the effective strength of disorder should saturate at @xmath229 in order to recover the low - temperatures ( or finite - width ) predictions , both for @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "a numerical and analytical study of the dp toy model is currently under preparation @xcite .    with the exact ` high - temperature ' result @xmath224 ,",
    "all the @xmath232-dependence is contained in the full - rsb cutoff @xmath233 as in , and with the two opposite limits @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) and @xmath236 ( @xmath237 ) we recover consistently the high-@xmath82 scaling predictions @xmath238 as in .",
    "this second gvm computation on the dp toy model actually gives the same qualitative predictions as for the full 1d - interface model ( high- _ versus _",
    "low-@xmath82 regimes , intermediate roughness regime at low-@xmath82 ) , but it yields by construction of the model the correct asymptotic roughness exponent @xmath239 and also with @xmath224 a non - zero _ thorn _ exponent @xmath240 since @xmath241 , compatible with the high-@xmath82 scaling argument .",
    "a physical benchmark for the roughness is the larkin length @xmath243 , which is the lengthscale marking the beginning of the rm asymptotic regime ( @xmath244 ) and encoded in the gvm approach into the maximum value of the self - energy @xmath180}(v_c ) \\equiv cr_0^{-2}}$ ] .",
    "this length along the _ internal _ direction of the interface has actually been physically defined by larkin @xcite as _ the lengthscale at which the typical relative displacement corresponds to the effective width @xmath242 of the interface : _",
    "@xmath245 .    plotting this quantity as a function of temperature in a @xmath246 representation ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig - larkin - xieff ] ) , for both gvm computations , we can clearly observe the existence of the two temperature regimes , by the comparison of the microscopic length @xmath108 and a thermal width @xmath247 as discussed qualitatively with scaling arguments in the section [ section - scaling ] .     of the 1d interface or dp toy model , as a function of temperature .",
    "it is defined with respect to the roughness at the beginning of the random - manifold asymptotic regime , i.e. at the larkin length @xmath99.,width=302 ]    those two regimes connect when @xmath248 defining up to a numerical constant the characteristic temperature @xmath136 .",
    "this result establishes that _ the two limits @xmath249 and @xmath228 can not be innocently exchanged _ , as underlined by the existence of the two opposite frg regimes of zero - temperature fixed - point @xcite _ versus _ high - temperature @xcite .",
    "the larkin length @xmath99 is typically below the resolution of the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric dws experiments mentioned before , and a temperature - dependence study of the ( asymptotic ) roughness and its  exponent has not been carried out on such 1d experimental interfaces yet .",
    "nevertheless the existence of a low - temperature regime with a physically finite width @xmath250 might be relevant even for those experiments , since a crude estimation of @xmath147 for ferromagnetic dws @xcite suggests that it could actually be of the order of magnitude of room temperature @xcite . as for the phenomenological creep formula discussed previously in the section [ section - dynamics ] , the whole scaling argument relating the roughness and creep exponents @xmath58 and @xmath119 , which worked so well for ferromagnetic dws in @xcite , essentially relies on a comparison of the typical scales at a single characteristic lengthscale @xmath99 : a so - called ` larkin domain ' encounters a typical energy barrier @xmath251 and it takes a typical minimal force @xmath252 to move it . plugging",
    "boldly our scaling for @xmath253 and @xmath254 in those expressions , we obtain in the high-@xmath82 regime that @xmath255 whereas @xmath256 and at low-@xmath82 both those quantities saturate to constants at @xmath147 .",
    "however , neither of those predictions are compatible with the affine behavior for @xmath257 observed numerically in @xcite , but at least now we know that this discrepancy might be linked to the appearance at low-@xmath82 of a whole crossover roughness regime at intermediate lengthscales , thus jeopardising _ a priori _ any argument based on a single characteristic lengthscale .",
    "we have briefly presented in these notes the physics of disordered elastic systems .",
    "there are many physical realizations of des , both interfaces or periodic systems . in order to probe the disorder - induced glassy properties of a des",
    ", one can study simultaneously its statics via its geometrical fluctuations ( roughness and pdf of the relative displacements as a function of the lengthscale ) and its dynamics via its response to an external force ( creep , depinning , avalanches , ... ) .",
    "different characteristic scales are at stake , and their competition is encoded at the core of the des formulation  the elastic energy @xmath29 , the disorder amplitude @xmath4 , the disorder correlation length @xmath108 and the temperature @xmath82  and mirrored in the lengthscales dependence of observables such as the static roughness or the size distribution of avalanches .    in the low - dimensional case of a 1d interface , an additional physical ingredient _ a priori _ as innocent as the existence of a finite width @xmath108 turns out to be crucial for the low - temperature properties in statics and _ a fortiori _ also in the quasistatic dynamics , as emphasized in the frg ` zero - temperature ' fixed point of the renormalization approach .",
    "we have shown how a combination of scaling arguments and concrete gvm computations on a pure static observable such as the roughness can already yield non - trivial elements to a coherent picture of the physics at stake .",
