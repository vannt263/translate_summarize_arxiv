    "many methods have been devised to improve upon the convergence of this expansion . among them",
    "is _ screened perturbation theory _ ( spt ) , which was first introduced in thermal field theory by karsch , patks and petreczky @xcite .",
    "spt constitutes a reorganisation of the perturbative series so that one resums selected diagrams from all orders of perturbation theory . in the following , we will indeed see that using spt improves the convergence significantly .",

    "the lagrangian density for a massless @xmath0-theory is @xmath8 where @xmath7 is the coupling constant .",

    "we now take @xmath13 to be of order @xmath1 and expand systematically in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "this defines a reorganisation of the perturbative series , in which the expansion is about an ideal gas of _ massive _ particles .",

    "we calculate the free energy in a double power expansion .",
    "that is , first we do a loop expansion in powers of @xmath1 , and thereafter we expand each diagram in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "the inclusion of the mass term in the interaction yields an additional feynman rule not present in the original theory , namely @xmath14{feynrule_mass } = \\frac{1}{2 } m_1 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this is called a _ mass insertion_. the free energy can then be written as a series of vacuum diagrams , @xmath15{loop0a } }              + \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=16mm]{loop1a } }              + \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=8mm]{loop1b } }              + \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=24mm]{loop2a } }              + \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=8mm]{loop2b } }              + \\raisebox{-3mm}{\\includegraphics[width=16mm]{loop2c } }              + \\cdots,\\ ] ] which we truncate at four loops .",

    "the former arises from the nonzero matsubara frequencies , whereas the latter comes from the thermal mass @xmath3 .",
    "we isolate the contribution from the zeroth matsubara mode , as it only contains the soft scale .",

    "finally , the results are truncated at @xmath5 .",
    "the pressure of the original theory is obtained in the limit where the two masses are equal , and is defined as @xmath21 the parameter @xmath3 in screened perturbation theory is completely arbitrary , and if we were able to include _ all _ loop orders , the result would indeed be independent of @xmath3 . to complete the calculation",
    "we must instead find a prescription for @xmath3 which is physically meaningful .",
    "the simplest choice is the tadpole , @xmath22{tadpole0a } }          =              \\frac{1}{2 } g^2 t \\sum_{p_0 }              \\int_p \\frac{1}{p^2 + m^2}.          \\label{eq : tadpole}\\ ] ] in the weak - coupling limit the propagator in the loop is massless , and eq .",

    "there are no exact numerical data available for comparison with our result at four loops , but experience with lower loop orders indicates that this is indeed a good approximation .",
