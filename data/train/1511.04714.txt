    "we hope this theorem will lead to simplifications and new results .",
    "the character - theoretic consequence of this theorem is that , for groups with disconnected center , the jordan decomposition shares many of the properties of that for the connected case ( commutation with deligne - lusztig induction for example ) . in type @xmath55 ,",
    "the jordan decomposition of characters links all series to unipotent series of smaller groups : even in that case , the good behaviour of those correspondences was known only when @xmath56 is large ( bonnaf @xcite for @xmath57 and cabanes @xcite for @xmath58 ) .",
    "one of the two key steps in @xcite was the proof that the category of perfect complexes for @xmath37 is generated by the complexes @xmath59 , where @xmath60 runs over borel subgroups of @xmath0 with an @xmath1-stable maximal torus .",
    "we show here a more precise result of generation of the derived category of @xmath37 .",

    "the set @xmath61 generates @xmath66 ( as a thick subcategory ) if and only if all elementary abelian @xmath2-subgroups of @xmath9 are contained in tori .",
    "this , in turn , requires an extension of the results of brou - michel @xcite on the compatibility between deligne - lusztig series of characters and the brauer morphism , to disconnected groups .",
    "we are able to achieve this by refining our result on the generation of the category of perfect complexes to a generation of the category of @xmath2-permutation modules whose vertices are contained in tori ( the crucial case is that of connected groups ) .",
    "such a result allows us to obtain a generating result for the full derived category , under the assumption that all elementary abelian @xmath2-subgroups are contained in tori .",

    "for instance , if @xmath82 , then the assumption of theorem  [ thd ] is satisfied .",

    "this result shows that when @xmath47 , the @xmath41-bimodule @xmath42 is independent of @xmath12 , a question left open in @xcite .",
    "we deduce that the bimodule is stable under the action of @xmath83 . using an embedding in a group with connected center , we show that the obstruction for extending the action of @xmath16 to @xmath52 does vanish .",
    "* remark. * theorem 1.3 is used in @xcite to construct equivalences of categories between tamely ramified blocks of @xmath84-adic general linear groups .",
    "roughly speaking , the main idea of @xcite is to `` glue '' the bimodules giving the morita equivalences of @xcite along a suitable building .",
    "the gluing process crucially uses the independence of the bimodules on the choice of parabolic subgroups .",
    "we begin in  [ se : generation ] with the study of generation of the category of perfect complexes , then we move to complexes of @xmath2-permutation modules and finally we derive our result on the derived category .",

    "brou and michel proved a commutation formula between generalized decomposition maps and deligne - lusztig induction .",
    "we need to extend the compatibility between brauer and deligne - lusztig theory to disconnected groups , and check that the local blocks obtained from a series satisfying @xmath85 also satisfy a similar assumption @xmath86 .    from  [ se : comparing ]",
    "onwards , the group @xmath0 is assumed to be connected",
    ". sections  [ se : comparing ] and  [ sec : proof ] are devoted to the study of the dependence of the deligne - lusztig induction with respect to the parabolic subgroup .",
    "the first section is devoted to the particular case of varieties associated with borel subgroups ( and generalizations involving sequences of elements ) .",
    "it is convenient there to work with a reference maximal torus .",
    "this is the crucial case , from which the general one is deduced in the latter section , where we go back to levi subgroups that do not necessarily contain that fixed maximal torus .",
    "the final section ",
    "[ se : jordan ] is devoted to the jordan decomposition .",
    "we start by providing an extension of the action of @xmath52 on the cohomology bimodule by proving that the cocycle obstruction would survive in a similar setting for a group with connected center , where the action does exist .",
