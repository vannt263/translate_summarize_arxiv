    "the lattice qcd simulations have been shown to be a powerful tool to study the properties of hadrons from first principle .",
    "in particular , ground state hadron masses in the quenched approximation agree with the experimental values in 10% accuracy @xcite .",
    "furthermore unquenching of the dynamical quarks tends to improve the agreement @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , studies of the excited hadrons are still in an exploratory stage in spite of their physical importance .",
    "( for a brief review , see @xcite and references therein . )    in this paper , from the quenched lattice qcd simulations with wilson fermions , we study excited nucleons with a special focus on the spectrum in the positive - parity channel @xmath0 ( the roper resonance ) and that in the negative - parity channel @xmath1 .    the fact that the mass of the @xmath0 is smaller than that of the @xmath1 has been a long standing puzzle : indeed , phenomenological quark models predict that @xmath5 because @xmath6 while @xmath7 and @xmath8 or @xmath9  @xcite . as possible resolutions of this puzzle ,",
    "exotic descriptions of the @xmath2 state and/or the @xmath3 state have been proposed such as the chiral quartet scheme  @xcite and the pentaquark picture  @xcite as well as the quark model with the effective flavor - spin interaction  @xcite .    in principle , the lattice qcd simulation ought to give the final answer to this problem .",
    "however , definite conclusions have not been drawn yet even in the quenched lattice qcd studies because of several technical reasons : first of all , one needs to make appropriate projection and isolation of the excited states to differentiate the @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states .",
    "furthermore , lattice artifact due to finite lattice volume becomes severer for the excited states than the ground state  .    to overcome these problems , ( i )",
    "we adopt a technique to combine the quark propagators with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions in time for precise parity projection @xcite , ( ii ) we employ the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite for extracting the excited mass spectra , and ( iii ) we utilize a larger spatial size ( @xmath11 fm ) with the lattice spacing @xmath12 fm ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that @xmath2 and @xmath3 states are nearly degenerate within statistical errors in the wide range of the quark mass ( @xmath14 gev ) .",
    "we found that , after the chiral extrapolation with an empirical  curve fit \" formula , the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states are consistent with the approximate degeneracy observed in experiment . also , we found a firm evidence of high - lying bound states composed of wilson doublers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : numerical_methods ] , we provide a brief introduction to the parity projection and mem . after summarizing our simulation parameters in section [ sec : simulation_parameters ] ,",
    "we discuss the numerical results obtained from the mem analysis of the spectral function in section [ sec : nstr_and_roper ] .",
    "the bound states of wilson doublers which appear as high energy peaks in the spectral function are discussed in section  [ sec : bound_state_of_doublers ] .",

    "the nucleon is described by the trilinear quark composite operator given by @xmath15u_c(x ) , \\label{eq : conv - n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is composed of a local scalar - diquark operator and a spectator - like quark field .",
    "this local composite operator couples to both positive and negative parity states  . the asymptotic form of the zero - momentum nucleon correlation , @xmath16 , may be expressed in finite temporal extent , @xmath17 , as @xmath18   \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\    + b\\left[\\lambda_{- }   a_{+ } \\mathrm{e}^{-m_+(t - t ) }             -\\lambda_{+ } a_{- } \\mathrm{e}^{-m_-(t - t)}\\right ] \\label{eq : gt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 .",

    "the second and forth terms on the right hand side of eq.([eq : gt ] ) appear since the nucleon is a composite particle . due to the presence of the third and forth terms corresponding to the primal reflections from the time boundary ,",
    "the naive projection @xmath22 is insufficient to extract a contribution of the desired parity state .  .",
    "] a solution to this problem is to realize the free - boundary situation ( @xmath23 ) , which can be achieved by using a linear combination of the quark propagators with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions in time  @xcite .",
    "the linear combination in the quark level automatically fulfills the linear combination in the hadronic level and then manages the free - boundary situation up to the first wrap - round effect  @xcite . adopting this procedure , one can project out the desired parity state by @xmath24 accurately without the contamination from the opposite parity state .",

    ", the prior knowledge is introduced in the entropic form , while in ccf , it is introduced in the gaussian form @xcite .    in refs.@xcite (",
    "the first three works in table [ table : comparison_other_group ] ) , degeneracy between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states has not been observed within the range of the quark masses where simulations are performed . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite and the present work ( the last two works in table  [ table : comparison_other_group ] ) , an approximate degeneracy of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3",
    "are seen within the statistical errors , although it is not yet clear where and how the level switching between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states really takes place as a function of the quark mass in our study .",
    "one of the major differences between the first three works and the last two works is the spatial lattice size .    as we have discussed in section [ sec : nstr_and_roper ] and will be reported in detail in a separate publication @xcite , our simulation with a smaller lattice ( @xmath68fm ) show that there is a sizable upward shift especially in the @xmath2 channel for @xmath69 and @xmath70 gev .",
    "this lattice artifact increases the @xmath71 difference even for rather heavy quarks and may partly explain the reason why degeneracy have not seen in first three works .",
    "in this article , we have studied the mass spectra of excited nucleons in the quenched lattice qcd simulations .",
    "we have focused our attention on the level ordering between @xmath0 ( the nucleon excited state in the positive - parity channel ) and @xmath1 ( the nucleon excited state in the negative - parity channel ) which has been a long standing puzzle .",
    "indeed , it is difficult to be explained by phenomenological quark models in which the roper resonance @xmath2 has much higher mass than the @xmath3 .    to attach the problem with a firm footing , we have utilized a technique to combine quark propagators with periodic and anti - periodic boundary conditions in time to eliminate the contamination of the opposite parity states in the baryonic correlator up to the first wrap - round effect .",
    "also , we have used the maximum entropy method ( mem ) to reconstruct the spectral function which contains not only the information of the ground state but also that of the excited states .",
    "since the finite size effect is shown to be severe for excited nucleons @xcite , we have taken a large lattice size ( @xmath72 fm with @xmath13 ) .    with all the above",
    ", we have extracted the masses of the @xmath10 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 states for @xmath4 gev , which are summarized in fig.[fig : switching ] .",
    "our results show that the masses of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states are approximately degenerate within statistical errors for wide range of quark masses , although the central value of the @xmath2 is slightly higher than the @xmath3 .",
    "this tendency is valid also at the physical point after making chiral extrapolation with a curve fit , eq.([eqn : expt ] ) .",
    "the latter result is in contrast to the predictions of the phenomenological quark models but is consistent with similar finding in ref .",
    "@xcite which employs different lattice action and different way of data analysis .",
    "whether level switching between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 states takes place at certain quark mass is an open question left for future studies .",
    "we have also studied the high - lying peaks of the spf by carrying out simulations on a coarse lattice ( @xmath73 ) with approximately the same lattice volume . from the analysis of the @xmath51-dependence and the quark - mass dependence of these peaks",
    ", we found a firm evidence that the high - lying peaks correspond to the bound states composed of two wilson doublers and one normal quark .",
    "there are various directions to be explored in future studies : to increase the statistics to pin down the precise location of the level switching ; to generalize the mem to treat the negative spf originating from the ghost @xmath74 state ; to make systematic studies of the other excited baryons and mesons .",
    "the nucleon excited states at finite temperature are also interesting to be studied in connection with realization of chiral symmetry in baryons  @xcite",
    ". the mem analysis also may be helpful to disentangle the pentaquark signal from a tower of the @xmath75 scattering states  @xcite .",
