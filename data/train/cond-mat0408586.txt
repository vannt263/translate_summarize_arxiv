    "a two - band model for superfluidity was introduced by suhl et al .",
    "@xcite in 1959 soon after the bcs theory in order to allow for the possibility of multiple band crossing through the fermi surface .",
    "suhl et al .",
    "@xcite observed that a larger number of energy bands crossing the fermi surface could increase the overall electron state density and lead to the onset of additional interactions .",
    "since then , this model has been used to describe high temperature superconductivity in copper oxides and more recently it has been used in connection to @xmath2  @xcite .    in the seminal work by leggett  @xcite , the existence of collective phase modes in two - band superfluids has been predicted in both neutral and charged systems . within the weak coupling ( bcs )",
    "limit , leggett showed that if @xmath1-wave interactions are attractive in both bands , an undamped long - wavelength _ exciton _ ( finite frequency ) mode , as well as an undamped long - wavelength _ phonon _ ( goldstone ) mode may exist .",
    "these modes were further studied theoretically  @xcite in the bcs limit , however , there was no experimental evidence of their existence until manifestations of two - gap behaviour  @xcite were found in @xmath3 .",
    "however , it has not been possible to study the evolution of collective spectra from weak ( bcs ) to strong coupling ( bec ) limit until very recently .",
    "advances in experiments with neutral fermi gases enabled the tunning and control of two - particle interactions between atoms in different hyperfine states by using feshbach resonances  @xcite .",
    "this kind of control is not fully present in standard fermionic condensed matter systems , and has hindered the development of experiments that could probe systematically the effects of strong correlations as a function of coupling or density of fermions .",
    "it was thought theoretically for many years that a weakly coupled ( bcs ) superfluid could evolve smoothly into the limit of tightly bound pairs which undergo bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "it was not until recently that the first experimental evidence that hyperfine states of @xmath4 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath5 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) can form weakly and tightly bound atom pairs ( cooper pairs ) , when the magnetic field is swept through an @xmath1-wave feshbach resonance .",
    "considering these recent findings in condensed matter systems and advances in atomic physics experiments , we expand leggett s calculation of collective modes in neutral two - band ( @xmath1-wave ) superfluids to all couplings by following a similar one - band approach @xcite .",
    "these collective modes for two - band @xmath1-wave systems are undamped in the low - frequency and low - momentum limits , provided that the two - quasiparticle threshold is not reached .",
    "we present results of the evolution of the finite frequency and goldstone s modes from weak coupling ( bcs ) and to strong coupling ( bec ) limits , and discuss briefly the possibility of observing these modes in experiments involving multi - component ultracold atomic fermi gases .",
    "while it is still a matter of debate that extentions of eagles  @xcite , leggett s  @xcite , and nozieres and schmitt - rink s  @xcite ( nsr ) suggestions are good quantitative description of the crossover phenomena , the evolution of collective modes can serve as a test of these ideas .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : effective - action - method ] , we discuss the effective action and the saddle point approximation for a two - band continuum hamiltonian with attractive interactions in the @xmath1-wave channel and a josephson interband coupling term .",
    "we analyse the effects of gaussian fluctuations in section  [ sec : gaussian - fluctuations ] , and derive effective amplitude and phase actions , from which the in - phase ( goldstone ) and out - of - phase ( finite frequency ) collective mode spectra are calculated in section  [ sec : collective - modes ] .",
    "the evolution of these modes is analysed as a function of interaction strengths from the bcs to the bec limit both analytically and numerical in section  [ sec : analytical - results ] . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our conclusions and propose that ultra - cold fermi atoms can be used to test our results regarding the evolution of the finite frequency and goldstone modes in two - band superfluids .",
    "finally , in appendix a , we present details of the matrix elements involved in the phase and amplitude effective actions , while in appendix b , we show the long wavelength expansion coefficients needed to evaluate the phase modes .",
    "a hamiltonian for multi - band ( or multi - component ) superfluids with singlet pairing can be written as @xmath6 where the indices @xmath7 and @xmath8 label different bands ( or components ) , @xmath9 labels the spins ( or pseudo - spins ) , and @xmath10 labels the momentum .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 is the fermion creation operator , @xmath12 is the density operator , and @xmath13 is the pair creation operator . here , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) is the kinetic energy of fermions .",
    "the reference energies are @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ bands ] ) ; @xmath19 is the effective mass for the @xmath20 band . furthermore , the terms @xmath21 and @xmath22 correspond to the coulomb and pairing interaction matrix elements , respectively . since in this paper",
    "we are interested only in the neutral case , we will ignore coulomb interactions , and consider only the pairing term .",
    "this choice is more appropriate to ultracold atomic fermi gases , while the inclusion of coulomb terms is more appropriate in the case of superconductors .",
    "the discussion of the charged case is postponed to a future manuscript . for the neutral case",
    ", we take @xmath23 to be separable , and we consider in general a two - band system with distinct intraband interactions @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and interband interactions @xmath26 and @xmath27 . notice that the off - diagonal terms @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 play the role of josephson coupling terms . for the purpose of this paper",

    "the tensor @xmath42 associated with the bosonic pairing fields @xmath43 can be written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 . performing an integration over the fermionic part ( @xmath46 $ ] ) leads to @xmath47 . \\label{}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the inverse nambu matrix is @xmath48 \\delta_{p , p ' } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "we choose an approximation scheme where the field @xmath51 is written as a sum of a @xmath52-independent ( stationary ) part and a @xmath52-dependent contribution @xmath53 we first write the inverse nambu matrix in terms of two matrices : @xmath54 the first one is the saddle point inverse nambu matrix given by @xmath55 and the second one is the fluctuation matrix @xmath56 used in the expansion of the natural logarithm of @xmath57 within this approximation , we expand the action to second order in the fluctuation field @xmath58 .",
    "this procedure produces an effective action of the form @xmath59 , where @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the effective saddle point action , and @xmath61 is the gaussian correction to it .",
    "the notation @xmath62 in the @xmath63 matrices is understood as the momentum labels @xmath64 .",
    "an important comment about @xmath65 is in order .",
    "writing @xmath66 in terms of its amplitude and phase @xmath67 the first term of @xmath65 becomes the sum of two contributions : the standard band - diagonal terms @xmath68 , and the band - off - diagonal @xmath69 corresponding to the josephson coupling between bands .",
    "since @xmath70 , with @xmath71 and all @xmath72 , the saddle point thermodynamic potential @xmath73 , has its quadratic term of the form @xmath74 which shows explicity the josephson energy . for the case chosen , where all @xmath22 are negative , the in - phase @xmath75 is the only stable solution .",
    "however , if @xmath26 were positive , another stable solution would appear where @xmath76 .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath77-phase solution , which we will not discuss here .    from the stationary condition @xmath78 we obtain the order parameter equations @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the quasiparticle energy spectrum .",
    "note that the order parameter @xmath81 is a separable function of temperature @xmath82 and momentum @xmath10 .    in this manuscript , we focus on @xmath1-wave superfluids , and thus consider only the zero angular momentum channel of the interaction @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , instead of taking @xmath84 ( independent of @xmath85 ) which would cause ultraviolet divergences ( logarithmic in two dimensions and linear in three dimensions ) in the integrations over momentum for the order parameter equation , we take @xmath86 as the corresponding symmetry factor in two dimensions ( 2d ) , and @xmath87 as the corresponding symmetry factor in three dimensions ( 3d ) . here",
    "@xmath88 , where @xmath89 plays the role of the interaction range in real space , sets the scale at large momenta , and it is necessary to produce the physically correct behaviour of a generic interaction at short wavelengths . in the case of 2d , @xmath90 for small @xmath10 and @xmath91 , while @xmath92 for large @xmath10 and @xmath91 , when a generic real potential is used  @xcite .",
    "there is no ultraviolet divergence in our theory since the momentum integrations always produce finite results .",
    "this choice of interactions has the advantage of making unnecessary the introduction of the @xmath82-matrix approximation to renormalize the order parameter equation , and redefine the interaction amplitude in terms of the two - body binding energy  @xcite . in the case of 3d , @xmath90 for small @xmath10 and @xmath91 , while @xmath93 for large @xmath10 and @xmath94 , when a generic real potential is used  @xcite .",

    "@xcite @xmath96 .",
    "either choice ( ours or nsr s ) produces qualitatively similar results as it will be later discussed .",

    "the inclusion of fluctuations are very important for the number equation near the critical temperature of the system , and in this case the saddle point thermodynamic potential needs to be corrected to @xmath100 , where @xmath101 should be calculated at least at the gaussian level . in this manuscript , however , we limit ourselves to fluctuation effects at low temperatures , as discussed next .",

    "notice that the new fields @xmath151 , and @xmath152 can be regarded essentially as the amplitude and phase fields respectively , when @xmath153 is small .",
    "this change of basis can be described by the following unitary transformation @xmath154 since we are considering the case where the saddle point order parameters @xmath155 and @xmath156 are in phase the fluctuation matrix in the rotated basis then reads @xmath157 where @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 with the @xmath161 dependence being implicit .",
    "the rotated matrix @xmath162 is as complex as the un - rotated matrix @xmath163 , and the real advantage of working in the rotated basis involving fields @xmath164 and @xmath165 is that the interpretation in terms of amplitude and phase fields is straight - forward .",
    "for instance , by inspection , notice that the _ phase _ fluctuation fields @xmath166 and @xmath167 corresponding to different condensates that are coupled by interband elements @xmath168 .",
    "the same applies to _ amplitude _ fluctuation fields @xmath169 and @xmath170 . when the interaction @xmath171 , the matrix element @xmath172 vanishes , the matrix @xmath173 becomes block diagonal and the two bands are decoupled . in this case",
    "the one - band results previously obtained are recovered for each independent band  @xcite .",
    "next , we focus on phase - phase and amplitude - amplitude collective modes .",
    "the easiest way to get the amplitude - amplitude collective modes is to integrate out the phase fields to obtain an amplitude - only effective action @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "the amplitude - amplitude fluctuation matrix has the form @xmath176 where @xmath177 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the amplitude - amplitude collective modes is obtained from the condition @xmath178 . in this paper , however , we are mostly interested in the phase - phase collective modes .",

    "the phase - phase fluctuation matrix has the form @xmath181 with @xmath182 .",
    "again , the dispersion relation for the phase - phase collective modes is obtained from the condition @xmath183 corresponding to poles of the phase - phase correlation matrix @xmath184 . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss both analytical results for the phase - phase modes in bcs and bec limits , as well as numerical results and the crossover regime .",
    "we note in passing that at finite temperatures , for continuum @xmath1-wave systems , the @xmath129 terms are well behaved in the long - wavelength and low frequency limit , while the @xmath130 terms do not in general allow for a simple expansion in the same limit due to the presence of landau damping ( see appendix a ) . however ,",
    "at zero temperature , the @xmath130 terms vanish , and a well defined expansion is possible at low frequencies provided that the collective modes can not decay into the two - quasiparticle continuum .",
    "thus , the collective mode dispersion @xmath185 must satisfy the following condition @xmath186 to obtain the long wavelength dispersions for the collective modes at @xmath187 , we expand the matrix elements of @xmath188 ( eq .  ( [ eqn : fluctuation - matrix ] ) ) in the amplitude - phase representation to second order in @xmath189 and fourth order in @xmath137 to get @xmath190 where expansion coefficients are given in appendix b. as it will become clear in section  [ sec : analytical - results ] , the @xmath191 order terms in the expansion are not necessary to calculate the collective mode frequencies @xmath192 accurately to order @xmath193 .    the expressions of the coefficients found in appendix b are valid for values of the interaction range parameter @xmath194 that satisfy the diluteness condition ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "however , in order to make analytical progress in the calculation of collective modes to be discussed next , we take the limit @xmath196 , since all the momentum integrals are convergent .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation encountered with the order parameter equation , where we used @xmath197 in order to ensure convergence of our numerical calculations for @xmath198 and @xmath199 as will be seen in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will focus only on the long - wavelength ( small @xmath200 ) limit phase - phase modes determined by the condition @xmath183 .",
    "we begin our discussion with the trivial case when @xmath201 ( where @xmath171 but @xmath24 and @xmath25 can have any negative value ) which corresponds to two uncoupled bands . in this case , the phase - phase fluctuation matrix @xmath202 becomes block diagonal , and we find two goldstone modes satisfying the relation @xmath203 where the square of the speed of sound @xmath204 in @xmath20 band is given by @xmath205 in the limit @xmath206 , the corresponding eigenvectors are given by @xmath207 for the first band , and @xmath208 for the second band , respectively .",
    "these results are identical to the known results in the one - band case  @xcite .    however , in the non - trivial case when @xmath209 , which corresponds to a finite jopephson coupling @xmath26 between bands , we find two modes . in order to determine the collective mode spectra @xmath210 accurately to order",
    "@xmath211 it is sufficient to rewrite the determinant condition in the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 are non - trivial and extremely complicated functions of the expansion coefficients @xmath214 given in appendix b. the exact dependence can be obtained via a symbolic manipulation program , but we will not quote these general results here or in appendices , as they are not particularly illuminating . instead , we will present simple limits , where their behavior can be easily understood .",
    "in this non - trivial case of @xmath209 , we find two collective modes .",
    "the first mode is the goldstone mode satisfying the relation @xmath215 where the square of the speed of sound @xmath216 is given by @xmath217 in the limit @xmath206 , the eigenvector of the goldstone mode is given by @xmath218 which is valid for all values of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 couplings .",

    "the precise meaning of the _ smallest expansion parameter _",
    "@xmath219 will be clear in sub - sections a and b , where we discuss analytically the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "the eigenvector in the small @xmath172 limit is exactly the same as in the case of general @xmath172 , since @xmath225 is independent of the value of @xmath172 .",

    ", the coefficients simplify to @xmath232 in the limit of @xmath233 , @xmath206 , and small @xmath172 , the eigenvector expression simplifies to @xmath234 and it becomes transparent that this mode is associated with _ out - of - phase _ fluctuations of the phases of the order parameters around their saddle point values , since @xmath235 are positive definite .    before discussing the collective modes in the analytically tractable weak and strong coupling limits ,",
    "notice that a finite @xmath236 goldstone mode is only possible when @xmath237 , and that a finite @xmath236 finite frequency mode is only possible when @xmath238 .",
    "if these conditions are violated the modes are non - existent .",
    "furthermore , caution should be exercised by recalling that the small @xmath137 approximation used in the expansion of general fluctuation matrix ( @xmath188 ) elements breaks down when the frequency @xmath137 of any of the collective modes moves up into the continuum of two - quasiparticle states .",
    "therefore , our results are strictly valid only for @xmath239 which corresponds to @xmath240 in the weak coupling ( bcs ) limit , and to @xmath241 in the strong coupling ( bec ) limit . with these conditions in mind , we discuss next the weak and strong coupling limits .",

    "analytic calculations are particularly simple in this case since all integrals for the coefficients needed to calculate the collective mode dispersions are peaked near the fermi surface ( see appendix b ) . in addition , we make use of the nearly perfect particle - hole symmetry , which forces integrals to vanish , when their integrands are odd under the transformation @xmath246 . for instance , the coefficients that couple phase and amplitude modes within a given band ( @xmath247 and @xmath248 ) vanish .",

    "<S> we use the functional integral approach to study low energy collective excitations in a continuum model of neutral two - band superfluids at @xmath0 for all couplings with a separable pairing interaction . in the long wavelength and low frequency limit , </S>",
    "<S> we recover leggett s analytical results in weak coupling ( bcs ) for @xmath1-wave pairing , and further obtain analytical results in strong coupling ( bec ) for both two and three dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse numerically the behavior of the out - of - phase _ exciton _ ( finite frequency ) mode and the in - phase _ phonon _ ( goldstone ) mode from weak to strong coupling limits , including the crossover region . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of goldstone and finite frequency modes from weak to strong coupling may be accessible experimentally in the superfluid phase of neutral fermi atomic gases , and could serve as a test of the validity of the theoretical analysis and approximations proposed here .    </S>",
