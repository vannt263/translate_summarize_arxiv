    "in making decisions regarding appropriate protection policy against radioactive contamination after nuclear accidents ( such as the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant : fdnpp accident ) , obtaining the individual dose distribution is crucial .",
    "the icrp recommends  @xcite the responsible bodies to characterize the individual dose distribution of the exposed population , and to take appropriate and optimized actions based on the alara principle .",
    "the external doses in the first four months of the great east japan earthquake were estimated within the framework of the basic health survey conducted by the fukushima prefectural government , based on population movement and activities extracted from the questionnaire distributed to fukushima residents  @xcite .",
    "after the summer of 2011 , many fukushima municipalities started individual external dose monitoring for members of the public living in existing exposure situations , although such large - scale measurements of the general public have not been considered mandatory in the conventional radiation protection schemes .",
    "these municipal dose measurement programs were not initiated nor supervised by the japanese central government , and thus they were not standardized in terms of the target group , dosimeter possession instructions , distribution / collection methods , and the format of data dissemination .",
    "the information available to both the residents and administration in the affected areas is therefore rather fragmented .",
    "this has made it difficult for citizens to grasp the overall picture of the external exposures even though data have been published by each municipality ( e.g. , fukushima city  @xcite ) and by academic sectors  @xcite .",
    "as such , the collected data have not been well utilized for the benefit of the affected communities .",
    "date city is located about 5060 km northwest of fdnpp . unlike iitate village , which is adjacent to date city and from which the entire population was ordered to evacuate in april 2011 ( called the `` deliberate evacuation area '' @xcite )",
    ", no evacuation order was issued to date residents , except for a limited number ( 128 ) of households for which the japanese government estimated that the exposure to the residents would exceed 20msv within the first year after the accident ( called the `` specific spots recommended for evacuation '' @xcite ) . among the municipalities in which all the residents continue to live after the fdnpp accident , date city has the largest gradient of contamination levels within the city borders .    in date city ,",
    "residents voluntarily started and actively participated in radiation protection measures immediately after the accident , e.g. , ambient dose measurements and school decontamination .",
    "the city office also endorsed and supported those activities from early on  @xcite .",
    "the mayor of date city ordered the launch of a project to monitor the individual doses of residents , as well as the ambient dose rate throughout the city , with an emphasis on gathering information which could be used to prioritize decontamination based on the contamination levels .",
    "for the measurement of individual external doses , date city distributed individual dosimeters ( radio - photoluminescence ( rpl ) glass dosimeters : glass badge^^ ) to kindergarten- , elementary- and junior high school - children in august 2011 .",
    "the target group was subsequently enlarged as the production capacity of the supplier increased , and the measurements are still ongoing .",
    "it is very notable that date city distributed the glass badges to all citizens ( @xmath0 in all ) for one year , from july 2012 to june 2013  @xcite , foreseeing that the actual dose data would become required when communicating to the citizens .",
    "the results published by date city were further analyzed by the iaea  @xcite .",
    "no other external dose measurement program of comparable scale has been done in fukushima , making date city s data the most comprehensive set of actual measurements of individual doses carried out after the fdnpp accident .",
    "in addition to the external doses , date city also started to measure the internal doses of citizens in october 2011 , which still continue .",
    "the decontamination of public facilities and roads was started in the fall of 2011 , and that of residences was started in the fall of 2012 ( to be discussed further in the following section ) . in march 2015 , date city announced the completion of its decontamination program .",
    "the present authors made use of the large - scale individual dose monitoring data provided by date city covering the period from 5 to 52 months after the fdnpp accident , analyzed the relationship of the individual doses to the results of airborne surveys conducted by the japanese government  @xcite , the effect of decontamination on the individual doses , and the relationship between the external and internal doses .",
    "these results will be published in a series of three papers .",
    "the purpose of this paper , the first in the series , is to establish a method for estimating individual external doses based on the available ambient dose rate survey data , such as the airborne surveys .",
    "date city mayor s office entrusted the data to the authors , one of whom ( mm ) is a date municipal government advisor .",
    "the geocoded household addresses of the glass - badge monitoring participants were pseudo - anonymized by rounding both longitude and latitude coordinates to 1/100 degrees prior to data analyses .",

    "date city is endowed with a rich natural environment and fertile arable land .",
    "the population in 2010 ( prior to the disaster ) was about 67,000 , and the number of households was about 20,000 , most of which were unevenly distributed in the flat land towards the northwest of the city .",

    "based on this map , date city made a decontamination plan ( first edition ) in october 2011 , which stated that decontamination method would be optimized according to the contamination level  @xcite .    in the date city decontamination implementation plan ( 2nd edition ) published in august 2012 , a zoning scheme was introduced .",

    "however , residents living in contaminated areas receive radiation close to the rotational irradiation geometry , as the radioactive cesium released in the fdnpp accident now exists almost uniformly in the environment . even in this case",

    "after large - scale radioactive contamination events such as the fdnpp accident , it should be expected that the response capacity of local governments will be overstretched . in the case of fukushima",

    "nomura et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the results of the glass badge measurements conducted continuously for school children in minamisoma city , and reported that there is no statistically significant difference in the personal doses between the group who reported in the questionnaire that they wore the badge properly , versus the group who said they did not . in the study of naito et al .",
    "@xcite , participants were given strict instructions regarding the usage of the dosimeter , which were duly observed , and they each carried a gps receiver together with the electronic dosimeter which recorded hourly doses .",
    "the hourly dose was compared with the ambient dose rate estimated by combining the gps information and the airborne monitoring database .",
    "the coefficient deduced from this well - controlled academic research targeting a small number of participants is extremely close to that derived in the current study , based on a municipality - driven long - term monitoring program involving tens of thousands of residents .",
    "we have shown that the personal doses measured using glass badges in date city are proportional to the ambient dose rates at the residences of the participants estimated from aircraft monitoring . as a result ,",
    "the authors conclude that it is possible to predict the external exposure dose received by each individual based on the aircraft monitoring data .",
