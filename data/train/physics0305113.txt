    "in this letter , we consider the hydration state of ho@xmath0(aq ) from the perspective of the quasi - chemical theory .",
    "then we draw upon earlier calculations on h@xmath2(aq ) @xcite , li@xmath2(aq ) @xcite , and na@xmath2(aq ) @xcite and demonstrate that the predicted hydration state provides a satisfactory description of the pair hydration free energies for hoh , lioh , and naoh .",
    "the involvement of ho@xmath0(aq ) in the speciation of be@xmath3(aq ) has been studied recently by the same methods @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath2(aq ) and ho@xmath0(aq ) ions are undoubtedly the most important ions in aqueous phase chemistry , and particularly biological chemistry .",
    "this is due largely to the fact that they are intrinsic to the aqueous media and common extrinsic occupants of those phases encounter these species .",
    "the be@xmath3(aq ) example noted above provides a specific motivation for the present work .",
    "beryllium is an technologically important metal , but inhaled beryllium dust is toxic and causes chronic beryllium disease in a subset of exposed individuals .",
    "this disease eventually leads to lung failure and is presently incurable .",
    "it is well - established that the ho@xmath0 ions can cross - link be@xmath3 ions @xcite .",
    "these colloidal beryllium - hydroxide clusters might ultimately trigger chronic beryllium disease .",
    "understanding the hydration state of ho@xmath0(aq ) is also a key to understanding its anomalously high diffusivity @xcite . indeed both h@xmath2 and ho@xmath0 are thought to diffuse by a proton / hole - hopping mechanism , and this has implications that extend from biological transport of these ions to the transport mechanisms in the polyelectrolyte membranes @xcite involved in some fuel cell designs .",
    "in the quasi - chemical approach @xcite , the region around the solute of interest is partitioned into inner and outer shell domains . for the case of ho@xmath0 ,",
    "the inner shell comprises the water molecules directly coordinated with the ion .",
    "this domain can be treated treated quantum mechanically , while the outer shell contributions can be assessed using classical force - fields or dielectric continuum models .",
    "the theory permits a variational check of the inner - outer partition @xcite , but this aspect has not been pursued here . in the present study outer shell contributions have been evaluated with a dielectric continuum model and the trends confirmed by molecular dynamics calculations using classical interatomic potentials .",
    "the inner shell reactions are : @xmath4}_n{}^- \\label{rxn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the free energy change for these reactions were calculated using the gaussian programs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1_n{}^-}$ ] ( n = 0@xmath54 ) clusters were geometry optimized in the gas phase using the b3lyp hybrid density functional@xcite and the 6 - 31+g(d , p ) basis set .",
    "frequency calculations confirmed a true minimum , and the zero point energies were computed at the same level of theory .",
    "single point energies were calculated with the 6 - 311+g(2d , p ) and the aug - cc - pvtz basis sets , although most of our results pertain to the former basis .    for estimating the outer shell contribution , the chelpg method @xcite was used to obtain partial atomic charges",
    ". then with the radii set developed by stefanovich et al.@xcite , surface tessera were generated @xcite , and the hydration free energies of the clusters were calculated using a dielectric continuum model @xcite . with this information and the binding free energies for the chemical reactions , a primitive quasi - chemical approximation to the excess chemical potential of ho@xmath0(aq ) in water is : @xmath6 where @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "@xmath8 is the equilibrium constant for the reaction eq .",
    "[ rxn ] in an ideal gas state , @xmath9 is the hydration number of the most probable inner shell cluster , and @xmath10 .",
    "the density factor @xmath11 appearing in eq .  [ eq : regrouped ] reflects the actual density of liquid water and its effect is included by a replacement contribution of @xmath12 = @xmath13 , where @xmath14gm/@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "( a detailed discussion on standard states and this replacement contribution can be found in grabowski et al .",
    "note eq .",
    "[ eq : regrouped ] is a simplification of the broader theory , and approximations enter at that stage . but all these approximations are available for scrutiny and improvement @xcite .    in table",

    "the greater stability of @xmath1_3{}^-}$ ] is independent of the level of theory ; calculations with the much larger aug - cc - pvtz basis give the same trends . clearly ( fig .",
    "[ fg : hoqca ] ) including the @xmath1_4{}^-}$ ] contribution to the sum does not appreciably alter the final excess chemical potential of ho@xmath0(aq ) : the whole effect is due accurately to the @xmath1_3{}^-}$ ] quasi - component .",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the agreement shown in table  [ tb : pair ] is excellent .",
    "the minor discrepancies are attributable to neglect of a variety of secondary effects : anharmonicity of the quasi - component structures , packing effects , and dispersion interactions .",
    "an assumption that @xmath1_4{}^-}$ ] was the dominant form would have predicted these hydration free energies to be significantly more positive than the experimental results .",
