    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is a convenient semiphenomenological quark model for the description of the low energy meson physics @xcite . within this model",
    "the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sbcs ) is realized in a simple and transparent way , and the low energy theorems are fulfilled .",
    "unfortunately , the ordinary njl model fails to prevent hadrons from decaying into free quarks , which makes the realistic description of hadron properties on their mass shell questionable .",
    "the exact solution of this problem seems to be a very difficult task .",
    "however , different methods have been proposed for its solution @xcite . in the present work",
    "we discuss a new approach which is close to that suggested in @xcite where an infrared ( ir ) cut - off has been used for the construction of a quark propagator without poles . in our approach ,",
    "the quark propagator is of the usual form ( with quasiparticle pole ) but due to the ir cut - off the pole does not lie within the integration interval for the quark loops .",
    "this method of taking into account the phenomenon of confinement is based on the idea of combining the njl and bag models @xcite .",
    "thus , together with the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off , which is necessary for the elimination of the uv divergences , we introduce the ir cut - off and thereby devide the momentum space into three domains . in fig .  [ domains ] these domains",
    "are represented in the coordinate space .",
    "the first domain corresponds to short distances ( large momenta ) , where quarks are not confined and the chiral symmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "this domain is excluded by the uv cut - off @xmath2 .",
    "the second domain corresponds to long distances ( ir region ) and here we have the confinement of quarks .",
    "we truncate this region from the integration over the internal momenta in quark loops , following thereby the idea of the bag model . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a new parameter @xmath3 .",
    "finally , there remains only the third domain @xmath4 where sbcs takes place , the quark condensate exists and the quark loops have no imaginary parts . in other words , quark - antiquark thresholds do not appear when calculating quark loops even if the mass of the decaying meson exceeds the effective mass of the free quark - antiquark state",
    ". therefore we can use quark propagators with constant , momentum independent , masses ( constituent masses ) .",
    "the first attempt to construct a njl model of this type has been made in @xcite where only the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons were considered .",
    "now we suggest a more general version of this model where the scalar , pseudoscalar and vector mesons can be described and the possibility of @xmath5-transitions is taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we give the effective chiral quark lagrangian and the gap equation describing sbcs .",
    "the pion mass formula is also obtained and it is shown that the pion is a goldstone boson in the chiral limit . in sec .",
    "3 the scalar meson ( @xmath0 ) is considered , and it is demonstrated that the quark loop with two @xmath0-meson legs does not have the imaginary part if we use the ir cut - off .",
    "the model parameters are fitted in sec .",
    "we consider the decay @xmath6 through the triangle quark loop where the quark - antiquark threshold does not appear when the ir cut - off is applied . in sec .  5",
    "the @xmath0-meson mass and the decay @xmath7 are estimated . in the last section",
    "we discuss the obtained results and give a short plan of applying this model for the investigation of the behavior of the mesons in a hot and dense medium in the vicinity of critical point .",
    "the values of the model parameters , the @xmath0-meson mass and the @xmath8 decay width are given in table i for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "let us consider an su(2)@xmath9su(2 ) njl model defined by the lagrangian @xmath10\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{g_2}{2}\\left [ ( \\bar q\\gamma_\\mu\\vec\\tau q)^2 + ( \\bar q\\gamma_5\\gamma_\\mu\\vec\\tau q)^2\\right ] \\label{lq}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after the bosonization of the four - fermion model ( [ lq ] ) one obtains its equivalent representation in terms of the scalar ( @xmath0 ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath11 ) , vector ( @xmath12 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath13 ) mesons @xmath14\\right\\}~.    \\label{lag2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the scalar fields @xmath0 and @xmath15 are connected by the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the current quark mass , @xmath18 is the constituent quark mass ; and the vacuum expectation of @xmath0 vanishes : @xmath19 .",
    "then , from the condition @xmath20 one obtains the gap equation on @xmath3 can be neglected since : 1 ) the value of the integral is defined by the uv cut - off @xmath2 and 2 ) @xmath21 does not depend on external momenta and , therefore , has not the imaginary part .",
    "hence , there is no need for an ir cut - off . ]",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the quark condensate .",
    "@xmath24 is obtained from the @xmath25-divergent integral @xmath26 by applying the 3-dimensional uv ( @xmath27 ) and ir ( @xmath28 ) cut - offs @xmath29 \\bigg|_{\\lambda / m}^{\\lambda / m}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the number of colors .",
    "now let us consider the free part of the lagrangian ( [ lmes ] ) for pion fields in the quark one - loop approximation ( see fig .",
    "[ qloop ] ) , where @xmath32 is the polarization operator of the pion . ]",

    "we can see that this pion mass formula is in accordance with the goldstone theorem since for @xmath47 the pion mass vanishes and it becomes a goldstone boson .",
    "the free part of the lagangian ( [ lag2 ] ) for the @xmath0-meson in the one - loop approximation ( see fig .

    "therefore , if we apply the ir cut - off @xmath56 then @xmath57 and the integral is real , which means the absence of the quark - antiquark threshold , or confinement .",
    "in this model we have five parameters : the constituent quark mass @xmath18 , the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) four - quark coupling constant @xmath58 , the vector ( axial - vector ) four - quark coupling constant @xmath59 , the 3-momentum uv cut - off parameter @xmath2 and the 3-momentum ir cut - off parameter @xmath3 .",
    "since we will use for the determination of these parameters only the four pion and @xmath1 meson observables @xcite : @xmath60 mev , @xmath61 mev , @xmath62 mev and @xmath63 , the ir cut - off @xmath3 is an arbitrary parameter of our model which is to satisfy the condition ( [ lambdacond ] ) .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the extension of the njl model for the light nonstrange meson sector of qcd , where the interaction of @xmath92- and @xmath93-quarks is represented by four - fermion vertices and the phenomenon of quark confinement is taken into account .",
    "this extension of the njl model describes the properties of the @xmath94 , @xmath1 and @xmath0-mesons in good agreement with the experiment and with the low - energy theorems .",
    "the model parameters are obtained by fitting the model so that it reproduces the experimental values of the pion and @xmath1-meson masses , the pion decay constant @xmath95 and the @xmath1-meson decay constant @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , it was shown that for the @xmath94- , @xmath1- and @xmath0-mesons the non - physical quark - antiquark thresholds do not appear if the ir cut - off is applied .",
    "the prediction of the @xmath0-meson mass and its decay width for different values of ir cut - off is given in table i together with the model parameters . from this table and",
    "the experimental data @xcite one can conclude that the parameter @xmath3 is allowed to have values within the interval @xmath97 .",
    "the value of the current quark mass turned out to be too low because in our model the quark condensate is greater than its conventional value @xmath98 .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ mpi ] ) .    insofar as the njl model is a semiphenomenological model based on the effective chiral four - quark interacion motivated by qcd on the phenomenological level , the introduction of quark confinement in our model by means of an ir cut - off ( without considering the gluon exchanges , instanton interactions etc . ) is in the spirit of this model",
    ".    an interesting application of our model is the description of meson properties in a hot and dense medium .",
    "the standard njl model has been already used for this purpose @xcite , where the temperature dependence of the masses of quarks and mesons and of the yukawa coupling constants was found .",
    "the ir cut - off @xmath3 is expressed through the constituent quark mass @xmath18 ( or the quark condensate @xmath99 ) , which decreases when the temperature @xmath100 and chemical potential @xmath101 increase .",
    "therefore , the ir cut - off will also decrease with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this will at length result in the deconfinement of quarks near the critical point .",
    "the temperature at which deconfinement takes place can be found from the condition ( see also eq .  ( [ i d ] ) ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the lowest energy of the quark in the quark loop .",
    "then , for the pion , the temperature of deconfinement follows from the condition ( [ deconfcond ] ) @xmath106 in the vicinity of the critical point , the constituent quark mass decreases with @xmath102 very quickly , and the pion mass slowly increases ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , when the constituent quark mass is as light as 4050 mev , the decay of pion into free quarks becomes possible .",
    "for the @xmath0-meson we obtain a lower value of @xmath107 : @xmath108    the decay channel @xmath8 is closed when @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigwidth ] ) ) and then @xmath110    note that , first of all , the quark deconfinement occurs for the @xmath1-meson , where we have the lowest @xmath107 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ deconfcond ] ) and @xcite ) @xmath111    thus , we have the following picture . at low @xmath102 and",
    "@xmath103 the @xmath0-meson is unstable since it has a large decay width ( [ sigwidth ] ) into two pions .",
    "the pion is stable since electroweak decay channels can be neglected here in comparison to the strong ones .",
    "the @xmath1-meson takes an intermediate position between @xmath0 and @xmath94 , having the @xmath112 strong decay width 150 mev . with @xmath102 increasing",
    ", there opens an additional decay channel : @xmath113 . at higher @xmath102",
    ", there exists an interval in the temperature scale where the decays of @xmath0 both into @xmath114 and into @xmath115 are forbidden , and the @xmath0-meson turns out to be a stable particle .",
    "next , when @xmath116 the @xmath0-meson is allowed to decay into a @xmath115 pair and only the pion remains to be stable . finally , near the critical point , when @xmath117 , all the particles decay into free quarks .",
    "the whole process of deconfinement is reflected in the following sequence of inequalities @xmath118 where we have four different temperatures separating different phases .",
    "therefore , one can see that the transition of the hadron matter to the quark - gluon plasma occurs not abruptly but in a smooth manner .    in our further work",
    "we are going to make a more careful investigation of these processes , which can play an important rle for the explanation and prediction of signals coming from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions and witnessing the chiral symmetry restoration and the quark deconfinement in hadron matter at the transition to the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "of particular interest is the study of quark substructure effects on @xmath1 meson properties which is possible within the present model since their modifications at the suspected qcd phase transition are cruical for understanding , e.g. , the low - mass dilepton enhancement as observed by the ceres collaboration @xcite .",
