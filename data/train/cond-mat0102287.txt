    "the use of photons for the controlled removal of matter , i.e. , laser ablation,@xcite has given rise to a large number of applications for materials processing and growth ; in microelectronics , examples include surface micromachining , surface cleaning , and the pulsed laser deposition ( pld)@xcite of thin films , which allows a wide variety of materials to be grown.@xcite in spite of this , a complete picture of the mechanisms underlying ablation for a broad range of pulse durations and wavelengths , and for such diverse materials as metals , polymers and semiconductors , is still lacking .",
    "the great complexity of phenomena involved in laser ablation , determined by the coupling of the laser pulse with the optical , elastic and thermal properties of the material , has been an obstacle in understanding . on a mesoscopic scale , the processes brought about by ultrashort  femtosecond  pulses have seldom been addressed.@xcite on the other hand , evidence of a competition between photomechanical@xcite and photothermal@xcite mechanisms has begun to emerge in the light - induced removal of matter with picosecond and nanosecond pulses . in the _ stress confinement _",
    "regime,@xcite ejection of matter proceeds from photomechanical effects : energy is deposited in the material in a time shorter than that needed for the generation of acoustic waves , and ablation is induced by the relaxation of the pressure gradient that builds up within the absorbing volume . in the _ thermal confinement _",
    "regime,@xcite energy is supplied to the irradiated volume at a rate faster than that at which it can be pumped out by thermal diffusion .",
    "consequently , the material is rapidly brought near its critical point as matter removal is driven by photothermal effects:@xcite the metastable superheated liquid undergoes a prompt transition to a gaseous phase consisting , to a large extent , of molten micron - sized droplets .",
    "this mechanism is known as explosive boiling or phase explosion;@xcite other photothermal processes include vaporization and normal boiling ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "finally , there have been repeated reports@xcite of a fourth process known as subsurface superheating ( sssh ) . in this scenario ,",
    "heating of the material causes evaporation as a result of which a steep temperature gradient develops beneath the surface .",
    "matter removal then takes place in a manner similar to a phase explosion following the relaxation of the pressure build - up in the bulk .",
    "it is not clear whether this mechanism is real as conflicting views can be found in the literature.@xcite    while it is generally assumed that the laser sputtering of metal surfaces involves phase explosion mechanisms ( see , e.g. , ref . ) , both photomechanical and photothermal effects have been shown to be operative in organic solids.@xcite in semiconductor materials such as silicon , however , understanding of matter removal processes induced by picosecond pulses has yet to come . in the present study",
    ", we give evidence of a sssh effect in the laser ablation of silicon .",
    "this is achieved by carrying out detailed molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations of the interaction of a picosecond laser pulse with a si(100 ) substrate , explicitly accounting for carrier - phonon scattering and carrier diffusion .",
    "it is assumed that the thermal annealing model ( tam)@xcite is valid so that thermal processes only are operative . in our computer code , ` madtam ' , we use the stillinger - weber ( sw)@xcite potential to model the atomic interactions ; preliminary results from an earlier version of our model can be found in refs . and .",
    "anticipating our results , we find that , below the ( predicted ) threshold fluence for ablation , @xmath1 , the solid restores internal equilibrium by the generation of pressure waves . above @xmath1 , our simulations reveal that matter removal is triggered by sssh effects : intense heating of the material leads to the thermal confinement of the laser - deposited energy and a steep temperature gradient beneath the surface .",
    "interestingly , the latter is not caused by the evaporation of atoms from the outer surface but , rather , originates from the process of carrier diffusion into the bulk . as a result",
    ", a strong pressure gradient builds up @xmath3 below the surface as the material is overheated up to a temperature corresponding to the critical point of silicon .",
    "ablation is subsequently initiated by the relaxation of the pressure gradient : large pieces  several atomic layer thick  of molten material are expelled from the surface , a consequence of the nucleation of voids in the bulk . before discussing these results , however , we give a detailed description of our model .",
    "the processing of silicon surfaces with femtosecond laser pulses involves ultrafast , non - thermal , phenomena which can not be accounted for by the sw potential . for this reason ,",
    "we remain within the picosecond regime where thermal mechanisms are involved ; this is discussed in sec .  [ preliminary ] . a description of the computational method , i.e. , molecular dynamics , follows in sec .",
    "[ md ] . finally , the generation of electron - hole ( _ e - h _ ) pairs by photons , as well as their relaxation through carrier - phonon scattering and carrier diffusion , depicted in fig .  [ cartoon ] , are detailed in sec .",

    "various computational techniques allow the interaction of light with matter to be simulated.@xcite among them , md appears to be a most suitable approach for addressing the numerous , complex processes involved in the laser ablation and desorption of matter : no hypotheses are needed to account for the various phenomena and atomic motion can be followed , in real time , provided that the interactions between the atoms are correctly modeled.@xcite however , because laser ablation involves large length and time scales , and thus a great computational effort , attempts involving classical md are scarce.@xcite in order to extend the range of md simulations , zhigilei _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a breathing - sphere model appropriate to the study of matter removal in organic solids.@xcite in this work , the phase explosion due to overheating and the laser - induced pressure build - up were identified as the key processes responsible for ablation in the regimes of thermal and stress confinements , respectively.@xcite    another md study of laser ablation was performed by herrmann _ et al._,@xcite who examined the interaction of femtosecond laser pulses with silicon ; a truncated version of the sw potential was used to account for the rupture of interatomic bonds following the absorption of photons .",
    "the predicted values of the threshold fluence for ablation thus obtained were at least an order of magnitude higher than those observed experimentally.@xcite this discrepancy is likely due to the inability of the sw potential to describe the non - thermal mechanisms involved in the interaction of femtosecond pulses with silicon .",
    "indeed , it is generally agreed@xcite that there exists , for silicon , a critical carrier density @xmath4 separating two distinct regimes :    \\(i ) with picosecond and nanosecond pulses , carrier densities remain below the critical value and the relaxation is thermal , i.e. , the carriers relax by transferring their kinetic energy to the lattice by the spontaneous emission of optical phonons in a characteristic time of @xmath5 . in this context , structural modifications such as melting and ablation are observed on a @xmath6 time scale .",
    "this model , known as tam , is suitable for laser pulses down to approximately 10  ps.@xcite    \\(ii ) with femtosecond pulses , on the other hand , the number of free carriers may exceed @xmath7 and ultrafast melting proceeds within @xmath5 by the collapse of the lattice.@xcite because melting occurs before the carriers have time to relax through the emission of optical phonons , the relaxation is non - thermal .",
    "this model , first proposed by van  vechten _",
    "et al._,@xcite is known as the plasma annealing model ( pam).@xcite    furthermore , if the light intensity at the surface exceeds @xmath8 , the generation of a high number of energetic carriers through a two - photon absorption mechanism leads to the complete ionization of the material by avalanche ionization and/or field ionization : a very dense ( @xmath9 ) and hot ( @xmath10 ) @xmath11-@xmath12 gas is generated near the surface.@xcite one then speaks of a solid - to - plasma transition as the material is carried away by the expanding plasma .    here , because we make use of the sw potential , it is assumed that thermal processes only are operative ; this restricts us to 10  ps or longer pulses .",
    "care is taken to avoid carrier densities in excess of @xmath7 ; in this context , the intensity remains well below @xmath13 .",
    "the md technique has been discussed extensively in the literature ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .",
    "briefly , the set of @xmath14 newton equations of motion , where @xmath15 is the number of atoms in the system , are solved from the knowledge of the interatomic forces .",
    "if @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the position , velocity and acceleration of the @xmath19th atom , respectively , the time evolution of the system is obtained by integrating , at discrete time steps , the following differential equations : @xmath20_{\\textbf{r}=\\textbf{r}_{i}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given a set of initial positions and velocities \\{@xmath21,@xmath22}. in the above equations , @xmath23 is the mass of the @xmath19th atom and @xmath24 the interatomic potential .",
    "thermodynamic quantities such as temperature and pressure can then be computed in a straightforward manner.@xcite    all calculations were performed using the program ` g`rof , a general - purpose md code for bulk and surfaces developed by one of the authors ( ljl ) .",
    "the original form of the sw potential was used to compute the forces between the silicon atoms.@xcite the equations of motion were solved using the velocity verlet algorithm.@xcite the md time step was set to @xmath25 for all simulations .",
    "simulations are carried out for a supercell with approximate dimensions @xmath26 ( containing a total of 31680 atoms ) representing a small volume of a si(100 ) target located at the center of the laser pulse .    in order to recreate the thermal and structural constraints of a macroscopic crystal ,",
    "the supercell is first repeated in the lateral ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) directions using periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the thermal constraint is imposed by coupling a few monolayers of atoms at the bottom of the supercell to a heat reservoir ; this is done by renormalizing the velocities to an appropriate maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) distribution .",
    "these atoms also serve to minimize the reflection of pressure waves at the bottom of the supercell .",
    "this latter phenomenon affects the results by , in some cases , adding an artificial contribution to ablation . though other techniques were proposed to attenuate such pressure waves,@xcite the method described above gives satisfactory results",
    "additionally , a few monolayers of atoms attached to their equilibrium positions are placed beneath the heat reservoir in order to mimic a semi - infinite crystal .",
    "the crystal is assumed to be initially perfect .",
    "the simulation of a 10  ps laser pulse , gaussian in time as well as in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 directions and of macroscopic width , is accomplished assuming that any spatial variation of the irradiance can be neglected .",
    "this is valid because the laser spot diameter is assumed to be much larger than the region under study .",
    "the irradiance is thus , in effect , spatially constant over the infinite @xmath27-@xmath28 plane by virtue of the pbc .",
    "the relatively large number of photons contained in a pulse , typically a few tens of thousands , ensures a uniform spatial distribution of the energy at the surface .",
    "the temporal gaussian distribution is simulated by the successive arrival of planes of photons spanning the entire surface of the supercell , the number of which being determined by the instantaneous irradiance ; they are separated in time by intervals ranging from @xmath29 to typically @xmath30 .",
    "the absorption of light in silicon proceeds by the excitation of valence electrons via intraband and interband transitions , the frequency of which depends on several parameters , such as the density of free carriers and the wavelength and intensity of the laser pulse .",
    "the absorption of photons of energy @xmath31 larger than the bandgap @xmath32 can induce three types of optical transitions : ( i ) an interband transition following the absorption of a single photon by a valence - band electron ; a bond is broken and the electron is promoted to the conduction band , leaving a hole behind . the newly created pair shares an energy @xmath33 , each carrier receiving an initial kinetic energy determined by the set of selection rules .",
    "( ii ) a nonlinear , two- ( or more ) photon , interband transition , occurring when @xmath34 photons are simultaneously absorbed .",
    "if @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the silicon work function,@xcite the electron can be photoemitted ; the condition @xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 when @xmath39 , thus ensures that no photoemission takes place .",
    "( iii ) an intraband transition , or free - carrier absorption , according to which the photon is absorbed by an electron already in the conduction band .",
    "following their creation , the carriers , because of momentum and energy conservation rules , occupy thin energy shells and a small volume of * k * space . in a characteristic time @xmath40 of typically a few tens of fs ,",
    "the hole and electron subsystems achieve , through electron - hole scattering , a quasi - equilibrium state described by a fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution at a common electronic temperature @xmath41 which is higher than the lattice temperature @xmath42 .",
    "thus , after @xmath43 , the carriers and the lattice constitute two decoupled subsystems , most of the energy remaining stored within the former ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "if @xmath45 represents the conduction band carrier density , the balance equation for @xmath11-@xmath12 pairs can be written as@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the current density , @xmath48 the carrier generation rate resulting from the absorption of photons , and @xmath49 the net recombination rate given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 the auger recombination coefficient and @xmath52 the impact ionization coefficient .",
    "the carrier generation rate @xmath48 is the sum of one- and two - photon processes , @xmath53 , and can be written as @xmath54 @xmath55 being the intensity of the laser at depth @xmath56 below the surface , @xmath57 the reflection coefficient at the surface , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 the one - photon and two - photon interband absorption coefficients , respectively .",
    "the absorption proceeds according to the beer - lambert law @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the free - carrier absorption cross - section .",
    "it is instructive to compare the two - photon to one - photon carrier generation rates , that is the ratio @xmath62 if we choose @xmath63 , each photon carries an energy @xmath64 , larger than the bandgap of silicon at 300  k , @xmath65.@xcite for si at 300  k , @xmath66,@xcite @xmath67,@xcite and @xmath68.@xcite for an irradiance as high as @xmath69 , a value at least an order of magnitude higher than the ones considered in this work , eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) gives @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , it has been shown@xcite that free - carrier absorption is negligible at short wavelengths , typically below 1000  nm .",
    "therefore , the one - photon interband transition is the dominant mechanism for absorption in the present case and all other processes are ignored ; as noted above , this allows the photoemission of electrons to be neglected .    in practice , upon arrival at the surface , the @xmath27-@xmath28 position of a photon is determined at random following a uniform probability distribution and reflected , again at random , according to@xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 . upon melting of the surface ( see sec .",

    "the silicon atom closest to the absorption site , and which possesses at least one valence electron , is then excited , i.e. , its number of valence electrons is decremented by one .",
    "an @xmath11-@xmath12 pair is created with an initial position given by the @xmath79 coordinates of the excited atom .",
    "the relatively large absorption coefficient at @xmath63 , combined with a depth of 60  nm for the simulation box , ensures that more than 99% of the energy is absorbed within the supercell .",
    "the determination of the exact initial kinetic energy of each carrier requires the knowledge of the allowed optical transitions .",
    "however , because very fast carrier - carrier scattering leads to a fd distribution at temperature @xmath41 within a few tens of fs , it is reasonable to assume the gas to be in a state of an instantaneous quasi - equilibrium .",
    "further , because @xmath41 is relatively large , typically a few thousand degrees , the fd distribution is well approximated by a mb distribution .",
    "thus , as an electron is promoted to the conduction band , its initial kinetic energy is calculated according to a mb distribution at the current temperature @xmath41 .",
    "the problem of determining the set of optical transitions as well as the carrier density and temperature - dependent chemical potential , required to characterize a fd distribution , can thus be avoided . using a box - muller transformation,@xcite a mb distribution at @xmath41",
    "is obtained by calculating the electron initial kinetic energy , @xmath80 , according to @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are random numbers taken from a uniform distribution .",
    "the hole thus receives an initial kinetic energy equal to ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "a number of microscopic mechanisms allow the system to restore equilibrium following irradiation by a laser pulse ; these are carrier - phonon scattering , carrier diffusion , impact ionization and auger recombination .",
    "impact ionization is the process through which an @xmath11-@xmath12 pair is created when an energetic electron collides with a valence electron : the former transfers part of its kinetic energy to the latter which is promoted to the conduction band . because impact ionization most likely originates from the generation of highly - energetic carriers through two - photon interband transitions ( negligible here",

    "the important relaxation mechanisms , in the present context , are carrier - phonon scattering and carrier diffusion , which we explicitly take into account .",
    "if the carrier density @xmath45 remains below the critical value@xcite @xmath4 , relaxation is thermal,@xcite i.e. , the carriers relax by transferring their kinetic energy to the lattice by the spontaneous emission of ( mainly ) optical phonons in a characteristic time @xmath91 ( also known as the carrier - phonon energy relaxation time @xmath92 ) .",
    "the population of optical phonons thus increases for approximately 1  ps , after which the latter relax by emitting acoustic phonons in a characteristic time @xmath93 .",
    "eventually , the energy is redistributed among all the vibrational modes of the lattice and a state of quasi - equilibrium is reached , characterized by a bose - einstein distribution at temperature @xmath42 .",
    "the further evolution of the system can then be described through thermal processes only as @xmath94 , but @xmath42 is still higher than its initial value .",
    "there are several types of carrier - phonon scattering processes .",
    "it is possible to identify the most important ones , as well as their associated mean scattering rates .",

    "the probabilities thus obtained are listed in table  [ tab : prob ] and were calculated using the corresponding values for @xmath100.@xcite as one can see , nearly 70% of phonons that scatter with electrons are optical . for holes ,",
    "however , the main mechanism is optical deformation potential scattering@xcite and we thus assume the holes to scatter only with optical phonons of 62.6  mev.@xcite moreover , the energy of the carrier determines whether scattering involves the absorption or the emission of a phonon . in si ,",
    "phonon emission is largely dominant for carrier energies exceeding @xmath102 , while phonon absorption dominates below @xmath103.@xcite    to determine the rate at which the energy is transferred from the electronic to the ionic degrees of freedom , the mean carrier - phonon scattering rate as a function of carrier energy , @xmath104 , is also needed .",
    "this quantity was calculated in si at room temperature using the full band - structure of the material by fischetti  _ _ et al.__@xcite a fit to their data was embedded in our computer model ; variations with temperature were ignored .    because of screening effects , however , the observed carrier - phonon scattering rate decreases for carrier densities @xmath105 , as recently observed by sjodin _",

    "finally , the probability of an electron suffering a collision with a phonon was assumed to be drude - like : the probability , @xmath110 , that a carrier has scattered with a phonon after a time @xmath111 , where @xmath111 is the elapsed time since the last scattering event , is thus @xmath112 in practice , we proceed as follows : after being generated , a carrier is given an initial position and kinetic energy as described in sec .",
