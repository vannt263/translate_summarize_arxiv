    ", we prove the existence and uniqueness of the unitarization of rota  baxter algebras .",
    "baxter algebra ( also known as a baxter algebra ) is an associative algebra @xmath2 with a linear endomorphism @xmath3 satisfying the * rota  baxter relation * : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is a fixed element in the base ring and is sometimes denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the relation was introduced by the mathematician glen e.  baxter  @xcite in his probability study , and was popularized mainly by the work of g .-",
    "rota  @xcite and his school .",
    "note that the rota ",
    "baxter relation  ( ) is defined even if the binary operation is not associative .",
    "in fact , such a relation for lie algebras was introduced independently by belavin and drinfeld  @xcite , and semenov - tian - shansky  @xcite in the 1980s , under the disguise of @xmath7-matrices , of the ( modified ) classical yang  baxter equation , named after the physicists chen - ning yang and rodney baxter .",
    "recently , there have been several interesting developments of rota ",
    "baxter algebras in theoretical physics and mathematics , including quantum field theory  @xcite , associative yang ",
    "baxter equations  @xcite , shuffle products  @xcite , operads  @xcite , hopf algebras  @xcite , combinatorics  @xcite and number theory  @xcite .",
    "the most prominent of these is the work of connes and kreimer in their hopf algebraic approach to renormalization theory in perturbative quantum field theory  @xcite , continued in  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to give an explicit construction of free _ noncommutative _ rota  baxter algebras in terms of rooted trees . to help put this study in perspective , we briefly review the interesting development of the _ commutative _ case .",
    "cartier  @xcite pointed out over thirty years ago  the existence of free ( rota)baxter algebras follows from well - known arguments in universal algebra but remains quite immaterial as long as the corresponding word problem is not solved in an explicit way as rota was the first to do . \"",
    "both rota s aforementioned construction  @xcite and the construction of cartier himself   dealt with free commutative rota ",
    "baxter algebras .",
    "later , a third construction was obtained by the second named author and keigher  @xcite as a generalization of shuffle product algebras .",
    "these constructions of free commutative rota ",
    "baxter algebras have important implications .",
    "for example , rota  @xcite applied his construction to give a proof of the celebrated spitzer identity  @xcite by relating it to waring s identity , another basic formula in combinatorics .",
    "the product in cartier s paper  @xcite is readily seen to be the same as the one by ehrenborg  @xcite for monomial quasi - symmetric functions and more recently by bradley  @xcite to explicitly describe stuffles and @xmath8-stuffles for multiple zeta values .",
    "furthermore , the mixable shuffle product in the construction of  @xcite appeared also in the work of goncharov  @xcite to study motivic shuffle relations and the work of hazewinkle  @xcite on overlapping shuffles . in  @xcite",
    ", the mixable shuffle product is shown to be the same as hoffman s quasi - shuffle product  @xcite which has played a fundamental role in the study of algebraic relations among multiple zeta values .",
    "there is also a description  @xcite of quasi - shuffles in terms of piecewise linear paths ( delannoy paths ) .",
    "our consideration of the noncommutative case has motivations beyond a simple pursuit of generalization . in the algebraic framework of connes and kreimer  @xcite for renormalization in quantum field theory ,",
    "a regularized feynman rule is viewed and studied as an algebra homomorphism from their hopf algebra of feynman diagrams to a rota ",
    "baxter algebra associated to the renormalization scheme .",
    "the renormalization and counter term for the feynman rule are derived from the algebraic birkhoff decomposition . in  @xcite , the algebraic birkhoff decomposition and the renormalization",
    "are shown to follow from the atkinson decomposition and the spitzer s identity in a noncommutative rota  baxter algebra . since the rota - baxter algebra varies with the choice of a quantum field theory and renormalization scheme , it is desirable to investigate universal or free rota - baxter algebras .    in a more theoretical context ,",
    "there have been quite strong interests lately in possible noncommutative generalizations of shuffles and quasi - shuffles ( that is , mixable shuffles ) . from the connection of these shuffles with free commutative rota ",
    "baxter algebras mentioned above , such noncommutative generalizations should be related to free noncommutative rota ",
    "baxter algebras .",
    "indeed one such generalization is the hopf algebra of planar rooted trees of loday and ronco  @xcite and we have shown in  @xcite that this algebra canonically embeds into a free noncommutative rota ",
    "baxter algebra .",
    "the tree construction of free rota ",
    "baxter algebras obtained in this paper make this embedding a even more natural tree - to - tree embedding .",
    "in fact , such an embedding has been our motivation to achieve a tree interpretation of free rota  baxter algebras .",
    "it is also our hope that our explicit constructions of the free rota ",
    "baxter algebras here will lead to further studies of rota ",
    "baxter algebras .",
    "indeed , some of such studies  @xcite have already been carried out concurrently with the writing of this paper . to compare with these and other related papers  @xcite",
    ", we note that there are different types of free rota  baxter algebras obtained from the adjoint functors of the forgetful functors from the category of unitary rota ",
    "baxter algebras to the categories of sets , modules , and algebras .",
    "they give rise to free rota ",
    "baxter algebras generated by ( or on ) a set , a module or an algebra .",
    "further , by replacing unitary algebras by nonunitary algebras , we get more forgetful functors and their adjoint functors .",
    "we summarize these categories and forgetful functors in the following diagram .",

    "baxter algebra is more significant then for an associative algebra , because of the involvement of the rota  baxter operator .",
    "in fact , it is with the help of our constructions of unitary and nonunitary free rota  baxter algebras that we prove the existence of unitarization of rota  baxter algebras . in @xcite",
    "the first construction of free rota ",
    "baxter algebras on another algebra were obtained in terms of bracketed words ( called rota ",
    "baxter words ) . in the present paper we consider free rota ",
    "baxter algebras on a module and on a set in terms of rooted trees and forests . in  @xcite , free rota ",
    "baxter algebras are also constructed in terms of decorated rooted trees .",
    "it considers the singleton generating set while we consider any generating set .",
    "the forms of the types of trees and decorations in the two papers are different with  @xcite using rooted tree with numerical decorations on the vertices and angles while us using rooted forests with angles decorated by the generating set or module .",
    "also in  @xcite the rota ",
    "baxter algebras are constructed on the decorated trees while in our paper rota ",
    "baxter algebras are defined on forests without decoration and then are extended to forests with decorations .",
    "another related paper is  @xcite where enumeration , generating functions and algorithms of bracketed words in free rota ",
    "baxter algebras were studied .",

    "the number of edges in a path connecting two vertices in a rooted tree is called the * length * of the path .",
    "the * depth * @xmath23 ( or * height * ) of a rooted tree @xmath24 is the length of the longest path from its root to its leafs . a * planar rooted tree * is a rooted tree with a fixed embedding into the plane .",
