    "in this paper we present a new , more comprehensive model for the evolution of hot gas in massive ellipticals and dominant ellipticals in galaxy groups . for the first time",
    "we combine gas produced by stellar mass loss with additional gas that flows into the galaxy regarded as a perturbation in the hubble flow .",
    "the radial distribution of gas density and temperature in bright ellipticals determined by recent x - ray observations can be understood only by combining these two sources of gas , stellar and cosmic .",
    "traditionally , it has been assumed that most or all of the hot gas observed in ellipticals arises as a result of mass loss from the aging stellar population , but recent observations with the rosat satellite indicate a more complicated origin for the gas .",
    "davis & white ( 1996 ) showed that the temperature of the hot gas is generally @xmath3 times hotter than the equivalent temperature of the stars @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the gas is in virial equilibrium in a deeper , and therefore larger , potential than the stars .",
    "even more relevant , x - ray images from rosat have revealed very extended regions of x - ray emission surrounding many massive ellipticals , extending far beyond the optical image .",
    "mathews and brighenti ( 1998 ) have shown that the emission from these extended regions can dominate the overall x - ray luminosity .",
    "this realization resolves a long - standing puzzle for elliptical galaxies : the enormous variation in x - ray luminosity @xmath2 in ellipticals having similar optical luminosity .",
    "however , the total mass of hot gas in the outer regions of many of these galaxies is too large to be understood in terms of stellar mass loss alone . in brighenti & mathews ( 1998 )",
    "we showed that agreement with the observed hot gas density and temperature profiles is greatly improved by assuming that a large mass of `` circumgalactic '' gas existed around the galaxy at early times .",
    "much of the gas that filled the galaxy at the time of galaxy formation is still present today .",
    "this raises the possibility that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies can reveal , like growth rings in a tree , the sequence of events that occurred long ago during the epoch of galaxy formation .    in this paper",
    "we extend this idea to consider the continuous inflow of gas into the galactic halo over the hubble time .",
    "this type of flow is a natural consequence of the large perturbation in the hubble flow that formed the galaxy and the small group in which it may reside .",
    "our approach in constructing these models is to adopt the simplest or most plausible procedure .",
    "we assume for example that the evolution of the dark matter can be described by the normal self - similar flow in a perturbed flat universe , but as the central stationary dark halo grows in size , it adapts to a shape dictated by more detailed n - body calculations .",
    "the baryonic gaseous component flows in with the dark matter but eventually shocks and compresses to the virial temperature @xmath5 k of the dark halo . from the very beginning , as x - ray energy is radiated away , cold gas condenses at the center of the flow . when a sufficient mass of baryons has accumulated , we form the stellar distribution of the elliptical in a single event . in this way we circumvent the complex dynamical and merging processes that occurred during the formation of the big elliptical . at the same instant",
    "when the galaxy forms the remaining gas near the galaxy is heated by type ii supernovae and the galactic stars continue to evolve as a single burst thereafter . in spite of the simplicity of this model , the subsequent evolution of the gas , both that expelled from the stars and gas continuously flowing in toward the perturbation ,",
    "is treated in a self - consistent , reasonably realistic manner .",
    "this is confirmed by the agreement of our results with current x - ray observations .",
    "it is gratifying that we can match so well the observed mass and entropy distribution in large ellipticals with our models and still conform to global cosmological and astrophysical constraints set by the conservation of baryonic mass , dark mass and supernova energy .    in this study",
    "we are concerned with establishing the global properties of hot gas in ellipticals as a consequence of gas dynamical evolution from the earliest times .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid unnecessary detail , we shall not discuss here the detailed metal abundance in the gas nor shall we consider the important effects of galactic rotation .",
    "although our results are generally applicable to all massive ellipticals and the group environment they inhabit , as a rigorous test of the general success of our models it is useful to use parameters specific to a particular well - observed galaxy ; for this purpose we have chosen ngc 4472 , the central dominant elliptical in a subcluster in the virgo cluster .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness variation in massive ellipticals can be inverted to determine the spatial variation of electron density with physical radius .",
    "the radial plasma temperature profile can be similarly determined from variations in the apparent x - ray spectrum viewed in projection .",
    "since the hot interstellar gas is in near hydrostatic equilibrium , the total gravitating mass @xmath6 can be found from the temperature and density profiles . at present",
    "the best galaxies for this purpose are those relatively nearby and luminous ellipticals that have been imaged by both _ einstein _",
    "hri and _ rosat _ hri & pspc : ngc 4472 , 4649 , and 4636 ( brighenti & mathews 1997b ) . of these we chose ngc 4472 for comparison with our gas dynamical models since the x - ray data for ngc 4472 exists over the largest range , @xmath7 to @xmath8 effective radii where @xmath9 kpc at a distance of 17 mpc .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) showed that the hot gas in ngc 4472 is at rest in the _ stellar _ potential in the range @xmath10 @xmath11 where the total mass ( assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ) is identical to the stellar mass predicted from the dynamical mass to light ratio based on a two - integral stellar distribution function ( van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "this excellent agreement indicates that gas pressure alone is sufficient to support the hot gas ; no additional pressure ( magnetic , cosmic rays , turbulence , etc . ) is needed nor indicated in @xmath10 @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , beyond a radius of @xmath123.5 @xmath11 the x - ray image of ngc 4472 becomes asymmetric probably as a result of an environmental ram pressure interaction or an interaction with the dwarf irregular galaxy ugc 7636 ( irwin & sarazin 1996 ; irwin , frayer , & sarazin 1997 ) .",
    "however , the azimuthally averaged x - ray surface brightness used by these authors to determine the average density profile is globally representative of luminous ellipticals .",
    "ngc 4472 is a prototypical bright elliptical that exhibits all of the characteristics of these massive galaxies .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 shows the gas density ( trinchieri , fabbiano & canizares 1986 ; irwin & sarazin 1996 ) and temperature ( irwin and sarazin 1996 ) profiles in ngc 4472 together with analytic fits as described by brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) .",
    "the corresponding total mass @xmath6 is shown in the lower panel of figure 1 together with best fitting stellar and dark halo mass distributions .",
    "the stellar mass is described with a de vaucouleurs profile with effective radius @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the stellar luminosity is @xmath13 @xmath14 corresponding to a total stellar mass @xmath15 @xmath16 using a mass to light ratio of @xmath17 ( van der marel 1991 ) .",
    "the dark halo in ngc 4472 dominates the total mass for @xmath18 .",
    "as shown in figure 1 a dark halo described by the navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) density profile ( nfw halo ) using a total halo mass @xmath19 @xmath16 fits the dark matter distribution quite well at large radii .",
    "[ a reservation about the applicability of the nfw profile to ngc 4472 expressed by brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) is now seen to be in error . ] the density distribution in an nfw halo is described by @xmath20 ^ 2 } \\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the current mean density of the universe , @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the current virial radius of the halo where the density is @xmath24 .",
    "the concentration parameter , @xmath25 , is based on figure 8 of nfw .",
    "all galactic parameters are scaled to our adopted distance to ngc 4472 , @xmath26 mpc .",
    "the agreement of the mass distribution of ngc 4472 with an nfw halo plus a de vaucouleurs core is good but not perfect , particularly at the transition region near @xmath27 kpc .",
    "the shape of the inner part of galaxy - sized dark halos is controversial , e.g. kravtsov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) predict a flatter density profile within the nfw characteristic radius @xmath28 ; such a halo would improve the fit to the total mass in figure 1 .",
    "however , any mass profile determined by n - body calculations in the absence of baryons will be centrally steepened and redistributed somewhat by the dissipative inward migration of the baryon component .",
    "nevertheless , in the calculations described here we shall adopt the combined de vaucouleurs and nfw mass distribution for ngc 4472 . the relatively small discrepancy apparent in figure 1",
    "has essentially no significant influence on our gas dynamical models .",
    "we have taken published profiles of the electron density @xmath0 directly from the literature although trinchieri , fabbiano & canizares ( 1986 ) and irwin & sarazin ( 1996 ) have made different assumptions about @xmath1 and the metallicity variation @xmath29 in the gas .",
    "since the indicated gas density depends on @xmath1 and @xmath29 as they influence the cooling rate , @xmath30 , the `` observed '' values of the gas density in figure 1 could change somewhat when more definitive information on @xmath1 and @xmath29 becomes available .",
    "for simplicity in estimating the growth of the dark halo in ngc 4472 , we assume a critical @xmath31 universe and a current age @xmath32 gyrs corresponding to @xmath33 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 . the self - similar flow of dark matter toward an overdensity perturbation in a critical universe ( bertschinger 1985 ) consists of two regions : a smooth outer flow in which the hubble flow reverses at a turnaround radius @xmath35 and an inner flow consisting of an ensemble of caustics or density cusps produced by orbital wrapping of the collisionless dark fluid as it oscillates about the center of the perturbation . as infalling dark matter accumulates in the dark halo , its mass is added to the outer part , leaving the central mass distribution essentially undisturbed .",
    "although newly arrived shells of dark matter pass through the central regions of the previously existing dark halo , they move very rapidly there and do not contribute appreciably to the time - averaged density except near the outermost caustic .",
    "averaging over the caustic peaks , the total dark mass density in bertschinger s similarity solution varies as @xmath36 , but this is much too centrally peaked when compared to typical n - body simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "we resolve this difficulty by assuming that an nfw halo forms as a stationary core at the center of an outer smooth flow described by bertschinger s similarity solution .",
    "the outer flow must be attached to the stationary nfw halo so as to conserve total dark mass at all times . in terms of the similarity variable",
    "@xmath37 the outer solution can be fit quite precisely with @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this analytic fit to the smooth outer flow onto a point mass is exact at @xmath42 , 1 and @xmath43 .",
    "the current virial radius @xmath23 within the self - similar dark halo corresponds to an overdensity of @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the current total cosmic density and @xmath47 @xmath16 is taken to be the current virial mass . in the self - similar solution the approximately stationary halo confronts the secondary inflow at the radius of the outermost caustic @xmath48 at time @xmath49 .",
    "the current turnaround radius @xmath50 can be found by insisting that the outer self - similar solution meet the nfw halo at radius @xmath51 where the interior masses of the two mass distributions must agree : @xmath52 where @xmath53 describes the nfw mass profile . with our chosen parameters ,",
    "the current turnaround radius is @xmath54 cm . by similarity arguments ,",
    "the turnaround radius at earlier times is @xmath55 .",
    "finally , the radius @xmath56 at which the nfw halo meets the secondary inflow is found by solving @xmath57 ^ 3 \\rho_{h}(t )   { \\cal m}[r_{c}(t)/r_{ta}(t ) ] = m_n { f[r_{c}(t)/r_s ] \\over f(c ) } \\ ] ] for @xmath58 , keeping @xmath28 constant .",
    "although @xmath59 is unvarying with time in the similarity solution , we have relaxed this condition in the expression above to achieve a fit to the nfw halo .",
    "the total mass distribution in the stationary halo and the external flow are illustrated at several times in figure 2 .",
    "within the context of the @xmath31 cosmology the baryonic contribution to the total density @xmath60 is constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis to a narrow range , @xmath61 ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) . for a given value of @xmath60 the mass distribution in figure 2 , multiplied by @xmath62 , represents the varying potential of dark matter .",
    "provided the temperature of the baryonic gas is much less than the virial temperature of the dark halo , @xmath63 k , cosmic gas will flow inward toward the galaxy precisely following the dark matter until the gas encounters a shock front . within this accretion shock the mass distribution of the baryonic component",
    "is determined by gas dynamics and the assumed model for star formation .",
    "interior to the outward facing shock the cosmic gas is heated to @xmath64 k , similar to the virial temperature of the dark halo .",
    "after a few gyrs a large mass of gas will have collected and radiatively cooled within the dark matter halo ; it is natural to assume that this gas forms the old stellar system observed today . in our very simple model for star formation",
    "we assume that all the stars in ngc 4472 form as a single burst at time @xmath65 . one possible choice of @xmath65 would be to assume that stars form from the cooled gas as as soon as a mass of cold gas equals the current stellar mass of ngc 4472 . however , dynamic considerations suggest that the de vaucouleurs stellar profile results from the merging of stellar systems that must have formed prior to the merging events , so stars are likely to have predated ngc 4472 .",
    "furthermore , gas cools more efficiently and can form stars somewhat sooner in an earlier generation of small galaxies in which the dark matter and cooling gas are more concentrated than in ngc 4472 . for these reasons",
    "we regard the time of star formation @xmath65 as a variable parameter in our models ; if the total mass of radiatively cooled gas is less than the mass @xmath66 of ngc 4472 at time @xmath65 , some of the hot gas is used to make up the deficiency since it could have cooled by this time in smaller pre - galactic stellar systems . at the time of star formation",
    "the gas density is reduced by a factor @xmath67/m_g(r_{sh})$ ] where @xmath68 is the total ( all of the cold and perhaps some hot ) gas mass within the shock radius @xmath69 just before @xmath65 .",
    "experience has shown that this artificial mass rearrangement at @xmath65 results in a relatively short - lived gas dynamical transient .    soon after time",
    "@xmath65 massive stars ( @xmath70 @xmath16 ) begin to produce snii explosions which heat the remaining gas considerably .",
    "we deposit this snii energy instantaneously at time @xmath65 by increasing the specific thermal energy density @xmath71 by an appropriate amount everywhere within the shock radius at @xmath65 .",
    "the possibility that some snii events predated the physical formation of ngc 4472 will not be considered here . the combined energy of the snii explosions is sufficiently large to drive an outflow from the galaxy and the associated galaxy group , creating a second outward moving shock that moves out beyond the accretion shock described above .",
    "as soon as stars form they begin to lose mass by normal stellar evolution .",
    "most of this stellar mass loss occurs at early times shortly after @xmath65 . unlike more realistic , rotating galaxies in which radiatively cooled gas forms into disks of size @xmath72 ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ; 1997a ) , in the purely spherical models discussed here cold gas can only form at the very center . from @xmath65 until the present time enough cold gas can form at the center of the galaxy to influence the gravitational potential there , causing the gas temperature within @xmath11 to rise considerably above values observed .",
    "we avoid this possibility here by assuming that the total mass of gas that cools after time @xmath65 also forms into stars distributed at all radii within the stellar galaxy .",
    "the mass of stars that is assumed to form in this diffuse manner after time @xmath65 is much less than the current stellar mass of ngc 4472 and can be ignored in evaluating the global galactic potential . therefore to implement this assumption",
    ", we simply ignore the self gravity of the cooled gas at the galactic center .",
    "we also ignore the relatively small snii contribution resulting from this type of additional star formation .",
    "although our model for star formation is obviously _ ad hoc _ and oversimplified , we believe that the subsequent dynamics of the hot gas , which is our main interest here , is modeled reasonably well .",
    "the standard gas dynamics equations that describe the evolution of hot interstellar gas in ellipticals are the usual conservation equations with additional source and sink terms : @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the specific thermal energy ; @xmath77 is the molecular weight and @xmath78 the proton mass .",
    "@xmath79 is the total mass of stars , dark matter and hot gas within radius @xmath80 .",
    "all three equations involve source terms describing the rate @xmath81 ( gm s@xmath34 @xmath82 ) that gas is ejected from evolving stars and supernovae , i.e. @xmath83 . to estimate @xmath84 we assume a single burst of star formation with a power law initial mass function ( imf ) between lower and upper mass limits @xmath85 and @xmath86 . using the procedure described by mathews ( 1989 )",

    "@xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xmath16 we find @xmath91 s@xmath34 and @xmath92 varies slowly with time ( @xmath93 0.83 , 0.97 , 1.11 , 1.34 at 0.001 , 0.1 , 1 , 11 gyrs respectively ) .    in the thermal energy equation",
    "@xmath94 is the optically thin radiative cooling coefficient which is a function of temperature and metallicity ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "thermal energy lost from the gas by radiation is largely restored by the gravitational compression of the gas as it flows deeper into the galaxy .",
    "radiative cooling eventually dominates in the densest parts of the flow . in the computed models we allow the gas to cool to @xmath95 k. in addition we assume that the interstellar gas is heated by the dissipation of the orbital energy of mass - losing stars and by supernovae .",
    "the mean gas injection energy is @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "the stellar temperature @xmath98 is found by solving the jeans equation for a de vaucouleurs profile with additional dark matter beyond @xmath11 .",
    "type ia supernova heating is assumed to be distributed smoothly in the gas ; we ignore the buoyancy of gas locally heated by supernovae that may transport energy and metals to larger galactic radii .",
    "the heating by supernovae is described by multiplying the specific mass loss rate of supernovae @xmath99 by the characteristic temperature of the ejected mass @xmath100 , @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the reduced hubble constant and we adopt @xmath105 ergs as the typical energy released in both type ia and type ii supernovae .",
    "the type ia supernova rate is represented in snu units , the number of supernovae in 100 years expected from stars of total luminosity @xmath106 .",
    "the dependence @xmath107 derives from the mass to light ratio for ellipticals given by van der marel ( 1991 ) , @xmath108 in solar units .",
    "the equations are solved in one dimensional spherical symmetry using an appropriately modified version of the eulerian code zeus .",
    "spatial zones increase logarithmically and extend far out beyond the turnaround radius where the cosmic gas is supersonically receding from the galaxy .",
    "therefore we can assume `` outflow '' boundary conditions at the outermost spherical zone , confident that no disturbance at the boundary can propagate back into the galactic flow .",
    "for our purposes here it is not necessary to consider the detailed thermal physics of the intergalactic gas ; we simply assume that the temperature of this gas is isothermal at @xmath109 k until it passes through the accretion shock .",
    "although the intergalactic temperature is expected to be greater than this ( due to photoelectric heating by quasar radiation for example ) , the value of the intergalactic gas temperature makes no difference in our calculations as long as it is small compared to the virial temperature of the dark halo of ngc 4472 , i.e. @xmath110 k.",
    "supernovae in ellipticals today are infrequent and are all of type ia .",
    "cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find a current rate of @xmath111 in snu units .",
    "the frequency of snia in the past is currently unknown although it seems reasonable to assume that it has been decreasing over cosmic time , @xmath112 ciotti et al .",
    "( 1991 ) recognized that the relative rates of stellar mass ejection ( @xmath113 ) and type ia supernova ( @xmath114 ) determine the gas dynamical history of hot interstellar gas in ellipticals .",
    "for example if @xmath115 then galactic winds may occur at early times but if @xmath116 winds may occur at late times .",
    "however , in the presence of large amounts of additional cosmic gas flowing into the galaxy , galactic winds driven by type ia supernovae will tend to be suppressed .",
    "we assume here that @xmath117 and snu@xmath118 = 0.03 so type ia supernovae are unable to generate winds by themselves .    however , the enormous energy released by supernovae of type ii produced by massive stars at very early times can drive an outflow from the galaxy even in the presence of secondary infall . with a single burst ,",
    "power law imf described by @xmath119 the number of snii per unit stellar mass formed is @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the total initial mass of stars .",
    "all stars greater than eight solar masses ( @xmath122 ) are assumed to become snii .",
    "for the salpeter imf discussed above ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) we find @xmath123 snii per @xmath16 .",
    "the specific supernova number @xmath124 is sensitive both to the imf slope and the mass limits ; for example @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath124 is uncertain by a factor of at least 2 or 3 . if @xmath123 , the total amount of snii energy produced during the single burst formation of ngc 4472 ( @xmath129 @xmath16 ) is @xmath130 ergs assuming @xmath105 ergs per supernova .",
    "an additional uncertainty is the efficiency @xmath131 of communicating this snii energy to the hot interstellar gas ; if massive stars form near cold , dusty gas clouds a considerably fraction of snii energy could be radiated away by dust and dense gas . in galaxy formation simulations",
    "it is assumed that @xmath132 of the supernova energy is returned to the interstellar gas ( e.g. kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ) , but in general @xmath131 must be regarded as an adjustable parameter .",
    "our objective is to solve the gas dynamical equations from the earliest times to the present ( @xmath32 gyrs ) and identify model parameters that result in gas density and temperature profiles similar to those observed today . while the number of uncertain parameters is formidable ",
    "@xmath133 , @xmath60 , @xmath65 , @xmath49 , imf , @xmath94 , snii energy , @xmath131 , etc .",
    " there are also robust constraints set by cosmological density variations and the global conservation of dark mass , baryonic mass and energy .",
    "we begin by describing the results of our `` standard '' model . the standard model is not chosen for its perfect agreement with @xmath0 and @xmath1 observed in ngc 4472 , although that agreement is quite satisfactory , but because the parameters and procedures used in the standard model are the most plausible and least controversial . in our standard model",
    "we assume @xmath134 and form the galaxy at time @xmath135 gyrs .",
    "a salpeter imf is used with @xmath89 and @xmath90 for which @xmath136 s@xmath34 is an approximate , time - averaged value of the stellar mass loss rate and @xmath137 is the current age of the stars .",
    "the imf also determines the specific energy generated by snii explosions , @xmath138 snii per @xmath16 , and we assume that this energy is fully converted to the hot gas , @xmath139 . clearly the important parameter for any model is @xmath140 .",
    "the current rate of type ia supernovae is @xmath141 and it has decreased with time as @xmath142 with @xmath117 . in the standard model",
    "the radiative cooling was varied with radius to simulate an increasing gas metallicity closer to the center of the galaxy , @xmath143 where @xmath144 $ ] with @xmath145 kpc .",
    "such a variation is consistent with the expected radial variation of gaseous metallicity and the metal - dependent cooling coefficients described by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "the function @xmath146 is designed to match a radial abundance variation similar to that observed in the hot interstellar gas in ngc 4472 ( forman et al .",
    "1993 ; matsushita 1997 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we compare the computed gas density @xmath147 and temperature @xmath148 for the standard model with observations of ngc 4472 .",
    "the fit to the observed temperature is excellent and the the density agreement is acceptable , within a factor of 2 of the observed values over a range of 100 in radius .",
    "recall that the `` observed '' density variation is also somewhat uncertain as discussed earlier .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the gas density observed beyond 10 kpc is higher than that of the standard model while the reverse is true within 10 kpc .",
    "we have found that the first of these problems can be corrected while the second is more difficult .",
    "figure 4 shows in more detail the spatial variation of gas density , temperature , pressure and velocity over the full range of our calculations at three times including @xmath49 .",
    "it is remarkable how little the central flow profiles have changed since @xmath149 gyrs .",
    "the fraction of the gas density within 100 kpc due to stellar mass loss decreases slowly with @xmath84 . while new gas continues to flow into the galaxy at later times , this gas accumulates largely in the outer regions which grow in size while the solution within @xmath150 kpc remains in a quasi - steady state .",
    "notice that there are two shocks . at time @xmath49 the main accretion shock is at @xmath151 and it is preceded by a second , smaller shock at @xmath152 . beyond this outer shock , at the turnaround radius , @xmath153 , the perturbed hubble flow velocity vanishes . the influence of the outer shock can be clearly seen in all flow variables .",
    "this outer shock begins at time @xmath65 when the snii energy is released ; as it moves outward it creates a transient baryonic outflow that pushes some gas far out into the galactic halo and beyond . at later times",
    "radiative losses just behind the outer shock are significant .",
    "the small increase in gas density before entering this outer shock is an expected feature of the perturbed hubble flow .",
    "this calculation was performed with an intergalactic gas temperature of @xmath95 k , but the flow pattern within the outer shock was unchanged when the calculation was repeated with intergalactic temperature increased to @xmath154 k.    the radial variation of the local baryonic fraction at time @xmath49 is shown in figure 5 for the standard solution ; the hot gaseous contribution to the baryon fraction is shown by the dashed line .",
    "interior to @xmath155 kpc most of the baryons are stellar , but the gaseous contribution becomes significant at 1 mpc and dominant beyond 10 mpc .",
    "the most interesting feature in this plot is the large baryonic minimum centered at @xmath156 kpc  this feature is a relic of the gaseous evacuation created by the release of snii energy .",
    "baryons formerly in this region were pushed outward , forming a region of baryonic overdensity ( @xmath157 ) just beyond a radius of 2.5 mpc .",
    "clearly such a large radius is irrelevant for ngc 4472 since it would enclose the entire virgo cluster .",
    "however , the baryonic depletion is real and the rapid spatial variation of @xmath158 in the outer galactic halo must be considered in interpreting observed values of the baryon fraction .",
    "for example , _ rosat _ observations in ngc 4472 extend only to radius @xmath159 kpc where the local baryon fraction is seen to be very steeply declining in figure 5 .",
    "clearly , measurements of the baryon fraction at such galactic radii could easily be greater _ or less _ than the true cosmic value ( @xmath160 for our standard model ) .",
    "we show in figure 6 the time variation of the mass of hot gas , cooled gas and stars in the standard model . at time @xmath135 gyrs all of the cold gas and some of the hot gas is consumed to form the single burst of stars in ngc 4472 .",
    "thereafter the stellar mass is assumed to be constant , @xmath161 ; we have ignored the small ( @xmath162 percent ) decrease in @xmath66 expected from stellar mass loss since time @xmath49 .",
    "although hot gas ( @xmath163 k ) continues to increase within the main accretion shock , the amount of hot gas within 150 kpc is constant for @xmath164 gyrs , suggesting a quasi - steady state in this part of the flow .",
    "cold gas continues to form after time @xmath65 reaching a final mass @xmath165 @xmath16 at the end of the calculation . while @xmath166 is comparable to the total mass of hot gas within 150 kpc , it is only @xmath167 percent of the current stellar mass .",
    "unlike our earlier models in which we assumed that all of the hot interstellar gas is generated by stellar mass loss , the additional supply of cosmic gas at later times in the standard solution also results in more cold gas overall .",
    "in computing the gravitational potential we have ignored the mass of cold gas , assuming that some or all of it contributed to later generations of stars , formed throughout a significant volume of the galaxy .",
    "however , it is interesting to relax this assumption and include the gravity of cold gas which , in our idealized non - rotating models , forms a concentrated point mass at the very center of the galaxy .",
    "this variant of the standard model is shown in figure 7 .",
    "compared to figure 3 , the density profile in figure 7 is slightly improved within a few kpc , but gas within about 5 kpc of the galactic core in figure 7 becomes heated as it compresses in the point mass potential established by the cold gas . this type of central heating , with temperatures extending to @xmath168 k , has not been observed .",
    "we have examined the convective stability of this core of hot gas and find that it is stable apart from a small rather insignificant region @xmath169 pc from the very center .",
    "however , the massive , compact cloud of cold gas that creates the central potential would also increase the central stellar velocity dispersion in a manner similar to that of a central massive black hole .",
    "but the total mass of cooled gas in this model , @xmath165 @xmath16 , is about 15 times more massive than the largest known central black hole in elliptical galaxies , @xmath170 @xmath16 for m87 ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "_ we conclude that all the interstellar gas that cools since @xmath65 can not reside within 2 or 3 kpc of the galactic center since its gravity would unrealistically heat both the stars and hot gas . _",
    "we therefore propose that this cooled gas goes into a stellar subsystem or disk of dimension @xmath171 kpc where its gravitational influence is greatly lessened .",
    "this assumption is consistent with our neglect of the gravity of the cold gas and , since @xmath172 , the additional contribution of the cold gas mass to stars is relatively insignificant .",
    "the stellar mass within 1 kpc @xmath173 @xmath16 is comparable to @xmath166 , but the stellar mass within 3 kpc is considerably larger , @xmath174 @xmath16 .",
    "only about half of the cold gas mass was available to form additional stars several gyrs after @xmath65 , more recently cooled gas must be accommodated in another way if there is to be no optical evidence for recent star formation .",
    "disks are attractive , but we recognize that the formation of disks in rotating ellipticals ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ; 1997a ) is accompanied by centrally flattened x - ray images that have not yet been observed .",
    "options for the final disposition of cold gas will be clarified in the future when we include galactic rotation in models such as those described here .    to illustrate the critical importance of additional circumgalactic gas in determining the global properties of hot gas in ellipticals , we show in figure 8 the density and temperature variations at time @xmath49 for the standard model when",
    "the dark halo within 150 kpc is non - varying and the only source of interstellar gas is stellar mass loss .",
    "the dramatic inadequacy of this model is seen in the density plot where the mass of hot gas is far too low in the outer galaxy . but the gas temperature is also too low .",
    "the central gas temperature in this model is consistent with observed temperatures only at the very center where the observed temperature is nearly equal to the stellar virial temperature @xmath175 k.    it is important to emphasize that the low temperature in this model can not be brought into agreement with the observations by increasing the current and past rate of type ia ( or type ii ) supernovae .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , increasing the snia rate also increases the interstellar iron abundance far above observed values ( e.g. loewenstein & mathews 1991 ) .",
    "second , brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) found that the gas temperature profile at @xmath49 is surprisingly insensitive to increases in the snia rate until that rate becomes large enough to drive a galactic wind . when a wind develops the gas temperature rises far too much and the gas density falls very far below observed values at every galactic radius .",
    "we could find no value of snu@xmath176 that corrected the obvious temperature discrepancies like that shown in figure 8 .",
    "davis and white ( 1996 ) found that gas temperatures in all bright ellipticals exceed the stellar virial temperature @xmath4 by factors of @xmath121.5 , as we find in figure 3 .",
    "we conclude that the long term accumulation of cosmic gas in the dark halo  that naturally results in both densities and temperatures similar to those observed  is essential to understand the nature of hot gas in ellipticals today .",
    "we now briefly discuss additional models in which some of the parameters are varied from those used in the standard model ; unless otherwise indicated the parameters are the same as those used in the standard model .      within the restrictions imposed by primordial nucleosynthesis , @xmath177 is tightly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , we find that our models are sensitive to these small changes in @xmath60 .",
    "for example figure 9 shows the density and temperature profiles at @xmath32 gyrs for @xmath178 and 0.06 . the overall agreement with the observed density and temperature profiles",
    "is noticeably degraded compared to the @xmath134 standard model described earlier .",
    "evidently the amount of cosmically inflowing gas that enters the galaxy has a profound influence on its x - ray appearance .",
    "the inflow of gas at the outer edge of the galaxy , some of which may have previously flowed out of the galaxy during the release of snii energy , also strongly influences the metallicity of hot gas deep inside the galaxy .",
    "interstellar gas within the stellar galaxy is a blend of gas that has come from stellar mass loss and from cosmic inflow ; its net metallicity is also a blend . to illustrate the contribution from these two sources of gas and its dependence on @xmath60",
    ", we show in figure 10 the fraction of gas at time @xmath49 that has come from stellar mass loss within the galaxy since time @xmath65 when the snii energy was released . in the @xmath178 solution",
    "almost all of the gas within the galaxy must have about the same average metallicity as the stars .",
    "in fact some of the gas lost from the stars in this model since @xmath65 has moved out beyond the stellar system which extends only to 100 kpc .",
    "by contrast , only 0.7 and 0.3 of the gas at @xmath9 kpc has come from post-@xmath65 stellar mass loss for @xmath134 or 0.06 respectively .",
    "the blending of two sources of interstellar gas , having different metallicities , complicates further the current controversy regarding the apparent discrepancy of the gaseous iron abundance with that in the stars , @xmath179 ( arimoto et al .",
    "1997 ; renzini 1998 ) .",
    "our @xmath178 model may be inconsistent with this inequality .",
    "the discrepancies seen in figure 9 must not be taken too seriously since some of the misalignment with observations can be removed by adjusting the total snii energy ( @xmath124 ) released and the epoch @xmath65 of galaxy formation .",
    "for example , when @xmath180 the excess gas density in figure 9 can be expelled from the galaxy by increasing the total snii energy released at time @xmath65 by @xmath181 . alternatively ,",
    "if the snii energy is left unchanged , the @xmath180 model can be improved by forming the stars at an earlier time , @xmath182 gyr , since there is just enough baryonic gas available at that early time to construct the stellar galaxy of mass @xmath66 .",
    "conversely , the @xmath178 solution in figure 9 can be improved by lowering the snii energy by @xmath181 and by assuming @xmath183 gyrs .",
    "several models adjusted in this manner are shown in figure 11 .",
    "as @xmath65 is increased the mass of gas within the accretion shock is greater so the post - snii temperature is lower ; this follows since we suppose that the snii energy is deposited within the shock radius at @xmath65 . in all our models",
    "we have assumed complete efficiency in converting snii energy to the hot gas , @xmath139 , so we have probably somewhat overestimated the snii heating .",
    "each model depends on the product @xmath184 so if @xmath185 then @xmath124 would need to be increased by @xmath186 for identical results .    in principle",
    "the degeneracy in the choice of the parameters @xmath60 , @xmath124 and @xmath65 can be partially removed by considering in detail the enrichment by elements produced in snii events .",
    "we shall not attempt this here , but simply note that to compensate a relatively small , @xmath187 change in @xmath60 requires a factor of @xmath188 change in the snii energy or in the mass available to be heated .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that successful models are possible if @xmath60 is much greater or less than the bounds set by nucleosynthesis .    finally , we have computed models in which snii heating is ignored altogether . in such models the gas density at @xmath49 greatly exceeds ( by factors of 2 - 5 ) the observed gas density at all galactic radii . the amount of cold gas at time @xmath49 is also unacceptably large , @xmath189 @xmath16 .",
    "we conclude that snii heating plays a critical role in establishing the amount of hot gas observed today in massive elliptical galaxies .      in our standard model",
    "we allow for a modest negative gradient in the gas metallicity by increasing @xmath94 toward the center of the galaxy .",
    "when compared to models with spatially constant @xmath190 , the @xmath191 assumption slightly improves the fit to the observed gas density for @xmath192 kpc .",
    "there is an inconsistency with this approach since the observed densities have been determined assuming uniform metallicity .",
    "however , the sensitivity of our models to reasonable variations of @xmath190 is not large .",
    "we have also explored the hypothesis advanced by tucker & david ( 1997 ) , binney & tabor ( 1995 ) , and ciotti & ostriker ( 1997 ) that an additional heating process is present in the hot gas that reduces the total amount of cold gas that forms over a hubble time .",
    "however , we have not succeeded in finding a heating source term for the thermal energy equation that significantly improved our models .",
    "if a small amount of heating due to some spatially distributed source is present , it is either rather ineffective or , when increased , generates outward propagating waves or shocks that result in peculiar density and temperature profiles and unsatisfactory x - ray surface brightness distributions .",
    "the limiting version of such models are those in which there is no radiative cooling at all , as if heating and cooling were in perfect balance , as some have suggested . when the standard model is recalculated with @xmath193 , for example , we find that the gas density in @xmath194 kpc rises as @xmath195 , completely diverging from the observations ; the gas temperature is too low by @xmath196 in this same region . in general",
    "therefore , we find that additional sources of distributed heating can introduce undesirable side effects that tend to degrade the agreement with observations .      the deviation between our theoretical models and the observed gas density is almost always in the sense that the model profile is too centrally peaked .",
    "this type of deviation has been noticed for many years and has led to the hypothesis of distributed mass `` dropout '' in which hot gas is assumed to disappear from the flow according to some radial dropout function that can be varied to obtain agreement with observations ( e.g. fabian & nulsen 1977 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "originally it was hoped that the mass dropout could be understood as some type of thermal instability resulting from an inhomogeneous flow .",
    "unfortunately , detailed hydrodynamical calculations have shown that thermal instabilities are disrupted by a variety of gas dynamical instabilities before an appreciable amount of cold gas forms ; see brighenti & mathews ( 1998 ) for a more detailed discussion of dropout and additional references .    nevertheless , in view of the popularity of mass dropout models we illustrate in figure 12 the density and temperature structure at time @xmath49 in the standard model when an additional sink term @xmath197 is included on the right side of the continuity equation .",
    "the model in figure 12 is based on @xmath198 and the dropout time is given by the local radiative cooling time @xmath199 ( sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "the dense , cooling regions that are dropping out contribute substantially to the total emission , reducing the apparent gas temperature @xmath200 below that of the the undisturbed ambient gas @xmath201 ; both temperatures are shown in figure 12 .",
    "however , almost the same density profile can be found if the stellar mass ejection rate @xmath202 is uniformly lowered . for comparison , a model based on lowering @xmath202 by 0.5 at all times",
    "is shown with dotted lines in figure 12 .    a decrease in @xmath84",
    "can be understood from two astrophysical arguments .",
    "first it is possible to reduce @xmath202 by altering the ( power law ) imf parameters @xmath203 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . unfortunately the stellar mass to light ratio also changes .",
    "for example , for values of @xmath203 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 that reduce @xmath204 by 2 , the mass to light ratio @xmath205 must increase by @xmath188 for any choice of the three adjustable imf parameters .",
    "such a large stellar @xmath205 is inconsistent with the value determined by van der marel ( 1991 ) and with the excellent fit to the x - ray data for ngc 4472 using his @xmath205 ( brighenti & mathews 1997b ) .",
    "second , @xmath202 can be `` virtually '' lowered if some of the gas ejected from evolving stars ( having a normal imf ) never enters the hot gas phase .",
    "this idea was discussed by mathews ( 1990 ) but discarded because of the many hydrodynamic instabilities that can disrupt stellar ejecta , increase its surface area and promote dissipative and conductive heating by the hot gas environment .",
    "however , if these difficulties can be avoided , the results in figure 12 suggests that observations of ngc 4472 may be consistent with this second type of `` dropout '' .",
    "for many years x - ray astronomers have noted that the x - ray luminosities of ellipticals @xmath2 span a huge range for galaxies of similar optical luminosity @xmath206 ( eskridge , fabbiano & kim 1995 ) . in spite of much effort , no intrinsic property of elliptical galaxies had been found that correlated with this scatter ( e.g. white & sarazin 1991 ) . however , in a recent paper ( mathews & brighenti 1998 ) we showed that @xmath207 correlates significantly with the physical size of the x - ray source , @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the radius that contains half of the x - ray luminosity in projection .",
    "the discovery of this correlation was not accidental , but was inspired by the hypothesis that halo gas and dark matter could be tidally traded among massive early type galaxies in small groups .",
    "such a tidal exchange of halo material would result in large , tidally dominant and centrally located ellipticals having huge , extensive halos and secondary donor ( giant ) ellipticals with more modest , tidally truncated dark matter and hot gas halos .",
    "because of the short dynamical time scales in galaxy groups , many authors have noted that groups are ideal for both the production of ellipticals by mergers and for promoting tidal warfare among the component galaxies ( merritt 1985 ; bode et al .",
    "1994 ; garciagomez et al .",
    "1996 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "1997 ; dubinski 1997 ) .",
    "it was this hypothesis that led us to seek the correlation between @xmath207 and @xmath210 .",
    "we can now test this hypothesis by truncating the dark matter and hot gas halos in the models described in this paper .",
    "although we can not describe fully realistic tidal effects with our spherically symmetric models , tidal truncations can be approximately simulated simply by removing all dark matter and hot gas beyond a truncation radius @xmath211 at some time @xmath212 in the past . for this purpose",
    "we begin not with a model that describes ngc 4472 at time @xmath49 , but with an elliptical with somewhat higher @xmath2 and containing more hot gas .",
    "this can be accomplished simply by lowering the snii energy below that of our standard model . immediately after the truncation , hot gas just within",
    "@xmath211 flows outward and a rarefaction wave passes into the interstellar gas at the sound speed . after a sound crossing time from @xmath211 to the center of galaxy , @xmath213 gyr ,",
    "a new cooling flow equilibrium is established .    in figure 13",
    "we show as dashed lines the final density and temperature profiles at time @xmath49 for the standard model but modified with @xmath214 .",
    "as expected , this model is overdense relative to ngc 4472 at large radii .",
    "also shown with solid lines are the current profiles of a model that was truncated at @xmath215 gyrs at radius @xmath216 kpc but is otherwise identical to the first model .",
    "the outer density profile of ngc 4472 is nicely fit by the truncated model and agreement with observed gas temperatures is satisfactory .",
    "_ since the size of the observed x - ray image of ngc 4472 , @xmath217 , is average for x - ray bright ellipticals of similar @xmath206 , it is very likely that ngc 4472 suffered such a truncation in its past .",
    "_ this truncation could have been accomplished by nearby group galaxies which may not be as massive as 4472 .",
    "we find that the final @xmath0 and @xmath1 profiles are rather insensitive to the exact time when the truncation occurred .",
    "finally , in figure 14 we show the trajectory in the ( @xmath218)-plane caused by truncations of this @xmath214 model at five different radii @xmath211 , all at time @xmath215 gyrs .",
    "data for the observed galaxies is provided in table 1 of mathews & brighenti ( 1998 ) .",
    "the large @xmath219 at the right in figure 14 shows the final location of the untruncated , gas - rich galaxy shown in figure 13 .",
    "the position of each small @xmath219 on the left shows the final locus of the truncated models . note",
    "that models truncated at @xmath220 and ( particularly ) 400 kpc lie rather close to the observed locus of ngc 4472 , as one would expect from figure 13 . _ as models of gas - rich ellipticals are truncated at different radii , they move precisely along the correlation among observed ellipticals . _",
    "this most encouraging result strongly supports our hypothesis that the spread in the ( @xmath218)-plane is generated by tidal exchanges of halo material in small groups .",
    "we have not considered here the detailed metal enrichment of the hot gas expected from type ia and ii supernovae ; this will be the subject of a future study .",
    "clearly , accurate observations and theoretical predictions of the radial variation of the abundance of iron , silicon and other elements in the hot gas will provide important additional constraints on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies . in the absence of this detailed information",
    ", it is interesting to compare the total amount of iron produced by snii in ngc 4472 with the iron present in the stellar system today . according to trager ( 1997 )",
    "the ratio of iron to @xmath221 elements is less than solar in most bright ellipticals , suggesting that the mean stellar iron abundance in ngc 4472 is about @xmath222 .",
    "the total mass of stellar iron in ngc 4472 is then @xmath223 @xmath16 where 1.4 is the ratio of total to hydrogen mass . if @xmath224 @xmath16 of iron is produced in each snii event ( gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1998 ) , then type ii supernovae should produce a total iron mass of @xmath225 @xmath16 , comparable but somewhat larger than the mass of iron observed in stars today .",
    "evidently the iron - producing capability of the salpeter imf is sufficient to account for all the iron in stars .",
    "in making this estimate we have assumed that the iron enrichment due to type ia supernovae goes primarily into the hot gas phase rather than into stars ; the total amount of iron in the hot gas within @xmath226 kpc is rather small , @xmath227 @xmath16 .    in general",
    "the density profiles in our most successful models resemble power laws throughout most of the observed galaxy while the observed @xmath0 suggests a double power law with a flatter slope within @xmath8 kpc . as a result",
    "our models predict a steeper gas gradient within the central @xmath8 kpc than is observed .",
    "it is this small deviation that the `` dropout '' hypothesis was designed to correct .",
    "while future observations will clarify this curious systematic deviation , it is possible that new physical effects become important in @xmath192 kpc .",
    "we have already noted that a small , but realistic galactic rotation could flatten the azimuthally - averaged gas density profile in this region .",
    "another possibility within @xmath121 kpc is the growth of magnetic pressure toward the galactic center .",
    "brighenti & mathews ( 1997b ) have shown that the total mass predicted from hydrostatic models is systematically lower than the known stellar mass within the central kiloparsec in each of the three bright ellipticals studied with _ einstein _",
    "this deviation can be understood if the gas pressure is assisted by an additional component of non - thermal pressure .",
    "the required magnetic field is large  we estimated @xmath228 gauss for ngc 4636  but not unexpected .",
    "mathews & brighenti ( 1997 ) showed that fields of this magnitude are a natural outcome of the ejection of fields by mass - losing stars .",
    "fields ejected in stellar envelopes are amplified by turbulent dynamo action in the interstellar medium and by the natural intensification that accompanies the inward flow of interstellar gas in which the magnetic pressure increases more rapidly than the gas pressure .",
    "the importance of magnetic or other non - thermal pressure components in the interstellar cores of ellipticals will be clarified when axaf observations become available .",
    "we have described here the overall evolution of massive elliptical galaxies with particular attention to the hot interstellar gas . although the stellar systems in giant ellipticals are thought to be very old , the mixing of the stellar orbits masks many details of the dynamical and enrichment processes that occurred during the time of galaxy formation .",
    "the metallicity gradient in the stars provides some clue to these early events but its interpretation is far from obvious .",
    "in contrast , the hot interstellar gas in ellipticals today does retain a large amount of information about star formation and metal enrichment events that occurred during the earliest phases of galaxy evolution .",
    "interstellar gas in ellipticals can help us solve one of the thorniest problems in modern studies of galaxy formation : the importance of `` feedback '' snii energy on the gas . among the major feedback uncertainties are : the total amount of supernova energy involved , its efficiency in heating the gas , and the time that snii enrichment occurred relative to the dynamical formation of the galaxies . regarding this last point , it is currently unclear if some fraction of the metals in the hot gas were made and ejected from an earlier generation of low mass galaxies before the formation of galaxy groups , or if all the metals were made during the formation of group galaxies that merged soon thereafter to create the ellipticals observed today .",
    "we believe that studies of the creation and evolution of hot gas in large ellipticals provide a unique insight into the feedback problem and may help us unravel some of these complex events that occurred so long ago .",
    "many lines of astronomical evidence indicate that the formation sites of most massive ellipticals are small groups of galaxies that are very old .",
    "dynamical studies of the evolution of galaxies in elliptical - forming groups indicate that ellipticals formed early in the dynamical evolution of these groups when mergers and tidal interactions were most likely ; if so , both the elliptical galaxy and the hot interstellar gas surrounding it are very old .",
    "remarkably , the hot gas we see today still contains a record of these past events .",
    "since snii enrichment is accompanied by an increase in entropy due to heating of the gas , enrichment and gas dynamics are closely linked .    in this study",
    "we have described the first comprehensive theoretical description of the evolution of hot gas in massive ellipticals that is fully consistent with important cosmological constraints .",
    "the goal of our calculations is not merely to explain the total mass and energy in the interstellar medium , but to account for the detailed radial dependence of these quantities throughout the observable range . in spite of the simplicity of our galaxy - forming model and our choice of a currently unfashionable flat cosmology",
    ", we have been remarkably successful in explaining x - ray observations of bright ellipticals in a cosmological context that conserves baryonic and dark mass , allows for all energy sources involved , and includes the detailed interaction of gas with mass - losing stars .",
    "\\(2 ) low interstellar gas temperatures in models without cosmic inflow can not be heated to the observed values by current and past type ia supernovae ; if this is attempted , strong galactic winds develop that are incompatible with observation .",
    "\\(3 ) excellent agreement with observed hot gas mass and thermal energy distributions ",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1  can be achieved by the addition of cosmic gas from secondary infall .",
    "this gas shocks and compresses to the virial temperature of the galactic halo , accounting for the hot gas temperatures observed in all massive ellipticals . as this gas flows deeper into the galaxy , it mixes with somewhat cooler gas expelled from the stars , resulting in positive gas temperature gradients ( @xmath229 ) in @xmath230 as observed in most or all bright ellipticals ( see fig . 1 of brighenti & mathews 1997b ) .",
    "\\(4 ) within the framework of a flat cosmology , we can account for observed gas density and temperature profiles only for a rather narrow range in baryon mass , @xmath231 , the same range that is consistent with primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "\\(6 ) however , our successful fits to observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 are degenerate in some of the parameters . for example , increasing @xmath60 is approximately equivalent to ( i ) decreasing the snii energy ( @xmath124 ) or its efficiency in heating the gas ( @xmath131 ) or ( ii ) increasing the time @xmath65 that the bulk of galactic stars formed so that more gas ( within the accretion shock ) needs to be heated by snii .",
    "both ( i ) and ( ii ) reduce the energy per gram delivered to the gas by snii explosions .",
    "this degeneracy is due in part to the simple , single burst assumption we have made in forming stars and our assumption that snii energy is deposited within the shock radius at time @xmath65 .",
    "more complex models that consider the details of metal enrichment and other options for the spatial distribution of snii energy may remove some or all of this degeneracy .",
    "\\(7 ) the current fraction of mass in baryons is expected to have a large minimum surrounding large ellipticals and their associated groups .",
    "this minimum results from an outward displacement of baryons that occurred when the energy of type ii supernovae was released . as a result ,",
    "observational measurements of @xmath158 within large galactic radii can either overestimate or underestimate the true cosmic value of this ratio .",
    "\\(8 ) since the epoch of star formation the amount of gas that has cooled is comparable to the total mass of hot gas observed today .",
    "this gas can not all cool within the central few kiloparsecs since its mass would unrealistically heat both the gas and stars there .",
    "however , even a tiny galactic rotation is sufficient to avoid this central concentration of cooled gas .",
    "\\(9 ) finally , when a relatively gas - rich version of one of our models is tidally truncated at some time in the past , the x - ray luminosity @xmath2 and the effective radius for x - ray emission @xmath209 both decrease .",
    "the vector due to truncation in the ( @xmath218)-plane lies almost exactly along the correlation discovered by mathews & brighenti ( 1998 ) .",
    "this give additional support to the notion , described by mathews & brighenti ( 1998 ) , that the enormous spread in @xmath2 for fixed galactic @xmath206 is due in some large measure to the tidal exchange of halo gas and dark matter among galaxies within groups of galaxies .",

    "<S> hot interstellar gas in elliptical galaxies has two sources : mass lost from evolving stars and a much older component that accompanied galaxy formation or arrived subsequently by secondary cosmic infall toward the galaxy group containing the elliptical . </S>",
    "<S> we present here an approximate but comprehensive study of the dynamical evolution of the hot gas in massive elliptical galaxies born into a simple flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> baryonic and dark matter are both conserved . </S>",
    "<S> we use ngc 4472 as a prototypical massive elliptical having a well - observed hot interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for star formation in a simple single burst using a salpeter imf but treat the gas dynamics in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy has a de vaucouleurs stellar core and a navarro - frenk - white dark halo surrounded by inflowing cosmic matter .    using rather standard assumptions and parameters , we are able to successfully reproduce the gas density and temperature distributions  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 and @xmath1  in the hot interstellar gas determined by recent x - ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> our model is sensitive to the baryon fraction of the universe , the type ii supernova energy released per unit stellar mass , and the time of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> but there is some degeneracy ; as each of these parameters is varied , the effect on model fits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 is similar . nevertheless , secondary inflow of cosmic gas is essential for successful fits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> some gas is expelled from the stellar galactic core at early times when the type ii supernova energy was released . as a result , the present day baryonic fraction has a deep minimum in the outer galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> interstellar gas that cooled since the time of maximum star formation can not have all collected at the galactic center but must be spatially dispersed ; otherwise both gas temperatures and stellar dispersions in the galactic center would be larger than those observed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , when relatively gas - rich , x - ray luminous models are spatially truncated at early times , simulating tidal events that may have occurred during galaxy group dynamics , the current locus of truncated models lies just along the @xmath2 , x - ray size correlation among well - observed ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> this is another striking confirmation of our model of elliptical evolution .    </S>",
