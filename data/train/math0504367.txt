    "in 1989 , rota formulated the following conjecture , which remains open .",
    "[ conj : rota ] let @xmath1 be a matroid of rank  @xmath0 on @xmath2 elements that is a disjoint union of @xmath0 bases @xmath3 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath4 grid  @xmath5 containing each element of  @xmath1 exactly once , such that for every  @xmath6 , the elements of  @xmath7 appear in the @xmath6th row of  @xmath5 , and such that every column of  @xmath5 is a basis of  @xmath1 .    partial results towards this conjecture may be found in @xcite . now consider the following conjecture .",
    "[ conj : fixed ] let @xmath1 be a matroid of rank  @xmath0 on @xmath8 elements that is a disjoint union of @xmath9 bases .",
    "let @xmath10 be disjoint independent sets of  @xmath1 , with @xmath11 for all  @xmath6 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath12 grid  @xmath5 containing each element of  @xmath1 exactly once , such that for every  @xmath6 , the elements of  @xmath13 appear in the @xmath6th row of  @xmath5 , and such that every column of  @xmath5 is a basis of  @xmath1 .    the main purpose of the present note is to make the following observation .",
    "[ thm : main ] conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] implies conjecture  [ conj : rota ] .    our proof is inspired by the proof of theorem  4 in  @xcite",
    ".    * proof . * since conjecture  [ conj : rota ] is known if @xmath14 , we may assume that @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath1 be given as in the hypothesis of conjecture  [ conj : rota ] .",
    "transversal _ to be a subset  @xmath16 that contains exactly one element from each  @xmath7 .",
    "double partition _ of  @xmath1 to be a pair @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a partition of  @xmath1 into @xmath0 pairwise disjoint bases  @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a partition of  @xmath1 into @xmath0 pairwise disjoint transversals .",
    "given a double partition @xmath21 , define @xmath22 observe that if @xmath23 then necessarily @xmath24 for all  @xmath6 , and then rota s basis conjecture follows  just let the @xmath25 entry of  @xmath5 be @xmath26 .",
    "so let @xmath17 be an arbitrary double partition with @xmath27 .",
    "we show how to construct a double partition @xmath28 with @xmath29 ; the proof is then complete , by infinite descent , since by hypothesis there exists at least one double partition . since @xmath27 , there exist @xmath19 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . since @xmath15 , there also exists  @xmath33 such that @xmath6 , @xmath34 , and  @xmath33 are all distinct . it will simplify notation to assume that @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ; no generality is lost , and it will be convenient to be able to reuse the index variables @xmath6 and  @xmath34 below .",
    "let @xmath38 , let @xmath39 , and let @xmath40 ( i.e. , @xmath1 restricted to the ground set  @xmath41 ) .    for each @xmath6 , let @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath13 is an independent subset of the matroid  @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath13 are pairwise disjoint because the @xmath7 are pairwise disjoint",
    ". therefore we may apply conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] to obtain an @xmath12 grid  @xmath45 whose columns @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and  @xmath48 are disjoint bases of  @xmath43 ( and therefore are bases of  @xmath1 ) and whose @xmath6th row contains the elements of  @xmath13 .    to construct the desired double partition @xmath28 , let @xmath49 except with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and  @xmath52 replaced with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 respectively . similarly , let @xmath53 except with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and  @xmath56 replaced with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and  @xmath59 , which are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath60 be any @xmath12 grid whose @xmath6th row contains the elements of @xmath61 in some order , and whose @xmath25 entry agrees with that of  @xmath45 whenever that entry is in  @xmath13 .",
    "clearly @xmath60 exists ( though it may not be unique ) .",
    "let @xmath62 be the @xmath34th column of  @xmath60 , for @xmath63 .",
    "it is easily verified that what we have done is to regroup the elements of  @xmath43 into three new bases and to regroup the elements of  @xmath64 into three new transversals in such a way that the contribution to  @xmath65 from intersections of the new bases with the new transversals is reduced to zero , and such that the total of the other contributions to  @xmath66 is unchanged .",
    "thus the overall value of  @xmath66 is reduced , as required .",
    "careful inspection of the above proof shows that it is easily adapted to prove a stronger statement than theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the statement obtained by replacing ` 3 ' with ` @xmath33 ' throughout conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] .",
    "then the above argument , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", yields the following result .",
    "[ thm : stronger ] for any @xmath68 , @xmath67 implies @xmath69 .    in particular ,",
    "proving @xmath67 for any fixed  @xmath33 would prove rota s basis conjecture ( in fact a stronger statement , namely @xmath70 ) for all @xmath0 greater than or equal to that fixed  @xmath33 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask why we have formulated conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] as @xmath71 rather than as  @xmath72 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath72 is false .",
    "the simplest counterexample is a well - known stumbling block that is partly responsible for the fact that there is no known general `` matroid union intersection theorem , '' i.e. , a criterion for determining the minimum number of common independent sets that a set with two matroid structures on it can be partitioned into .",
    "namely , take @xmath73 , the graphic matroid of the complete graph on four vertices , and let the @xmath13 be the three pairs of non - incident edges of  @xmath74 .",
    "another counterexample arises from a matroid that oxley  @xcite calls  @xmath75 .",
    "representing  @xmath75 by vectors in euclidean 4-space , we can for example let @xmath76 it may be possible to construct other examples from non - base - orderable matroids such as those in  @xcite .    despite these counterexamples to  @xmath72 , we believe that conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] is plausible . using a database of matroids with nine elements kindly supplied by gordon royle  @xcite , we have computationally verified conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] for the case @xmath77 .    in an earlier version of this paper",
    ", the formulation of conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] did not require the @xmath13 to be independent .",
    "a counterexample to that version of the conjecture was found by colin mcdiarmid .",
    "take the complete graph on the vertex set @xmath78 , and create an extra copy of the three edges incident to vertex  @xmath79 .",
    "call the edges @xmath80 , and let @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "more generally , as pointed out by an anonymous referee , if @xmath33 is odd , then a wheel with @xmath84 copies of each of its @xmath33 spokes yields a counterexample to @xmath67 if the @xmath13 are not required to be independent .    in closing",
    ", we speculate that conjecture  [ conj : fixed ] might be provable using the following strategy . first , develop a modified version of @xmath72 that says that the conclusion holds provided certain `` obstructions '' ( such as @xmath73 and  @xmath75 ) are absent .",
    "then use rado s theorem ( 12.2.2 of  @xcite ) , or a suitable strengthening of it , to construct a first column of  @xmath5 in such a way that the remaining @xmath85 elements are obstruction - free . applying the modified version of  @xmath72",
    "would then yield the desired result .",
    "the analysis of obstructions should hopefully be tractable since there are only 3 columns to consider .",
    "i wish to thank jonathan farley , patrick brosnan , and james oxley for useful discussions , and a referee for correcting an error in my counterexample based on  @xmath75 ."
