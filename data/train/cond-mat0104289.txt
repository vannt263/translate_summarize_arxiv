    "metal - insulator transition of electronic systems due to randomness was predicted by anderson in 1958 .",
    "@xcite let @xmath2 be a quantity which controls the conductivity , such as impurity density or electron density .",
    "then the system undergoes a transition from a conductor to an insulator at @xmath3 , the critical value of @xmath2 ( in the following we assume that the system is metallic for @xmath4 ) .",
    "one of the main interests on this subject is the critical behavior of the transition , namely , how the conductivity @xmath5 depends on @xmath2 near the critical point . in spite of an amount of theoretical studies , little progress has been made about this problem , until the appearance of the renormalization group ( or scaling ) theory developed by wegner  @xcite and by abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite .    the scaling hypothesis by abrahams et al",
    ". leads to the renormalization group equation  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the conductance of a system of size @xmath8 .",
    "the renormalization group theory predicts that the transition is continuous in three - dimension : @xmath5 vanishes continuously at @xmath3 . the critical index ( or exponent ) @xmath9 of the transition",
    "is defined by the equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a constant which is dependent on the microscopic structure of the system , while @xmath9 is believed to be universal and dependent only on the universality class , i.e. , the fundamental symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "below we will treat the orthogonal class , in which the hamiltonian is composed of the kinetic energy and the impurity potential , without spin - orbit coupling nor magnetic field .",
    "the critical index @xmath9 is given in terms of the @xmath0-function @xmath12 : @xmath13 where the prime on @xmath12 indicates the derivative , and @xmath14 is the fixed point value of @xmath15 , satisfying @xmath16    elaborate calculations of the @xmath0-function have been done by wegner  @xcite and hikami ,  @xcite and their results lead to @xmath17 .",
    "this problem was investigated also by numerical methods .",
    "kramer and mackinnon developed a method to estimate @xmath9 from numerical data , and they obtained a value considerably larger than unity .",
    "@xcite calculations with high accuracy have been performed recently by slevin and ohtsuki , and they found that  @xcite @xmath18    thus the discrepancy between the analytic and the numerical methods is significant . at present , as long as the accuracy of the results are concerned , the analytic methods seem less reliable than the numerical methods .",
    "however , it is still important to pursue better analytic methods , because there are some aspects of which the better understandings are obtained only by analytic methods .    in this paper",
    "we propose an analytic theory based on an idea different from those of existing theories .",
    "we will find it well reproduces the results of numerical studies .",
    "in this section we briefly review the method applied so far to calculate @xmath0-function , for it is the starting point of the present theory , too .",
    "the details of the calculations are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite to be specific , we consider an electron gas system with randomly distributed impurities .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 s are the positions of the impurities , which are assume to be distributed uniformly with the average density @xmath21 , independently of each other .",
    "so far the @xmath0-function was calculated in the form of the power series in @xmath22 .",
    "the term of @xmath22 arises from the lowest order interference effect of electron wave scattered by impurities . without the interference correction ,",
    "the conductivity is given by boltzmann ( classical ) conductivity @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron density , and @xmath25 is the electron scattering time by impurities given by @xmath26 @xmath27 being the density of states at the fermi level .    in thermal green s function formalism ,",
    "@xcite the interference correction to the boltzmann conductivity comes from the term corresponding to the feymann graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    "the solid lines and the dotted lines indicate the one electron green s functions and the impurity potential , respectively ; the wavy line indicates the cooperon propagator .",
    "@xmath28{figure1.epsf}\\ ] ]    up to this order , the conductivity of an infinitely large system is given by @xmath29\\ , , \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the diffusion coefficient defined by @xmath31 @xmath32 being the fermi velocity , and the integral is to be done in the region @xmath33 .",
    "the conductance @xmath7 is defined in terms of the conductivity @xmath34 of the system of size @xmath8 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant of dimension of resistance to make @xmath7 dimensionless , to be determined later .",
    "we postulate that @xmath34 is given by the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) in which the integral is cut off at @xmath37 , @xmath38 being a numerical constant of order 1 ( we consider the region @xmath39 ) .",
    "then we obtain @xmath40\\ , , \\label{gl}\\ ] ] and @xmath0-function is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) : @xmath41 where we have taken @xmath36 so that @xmath42 as is seen from eqs .",
    "( [ nu ] ) and ( [ gc ] ) , the ambiguity of @xmath36 within a numerical factor does not affect the value of @xmath9 , and we find that @xmath43    calculations of @xmath0-function up to the order @xmath44 were done by wegner  @xcite and hikami ,  @xcite .",
    "their @xmath0-functions lead to @xmath45 , and the deviation from the numerical value becomes even larger .",
    "the inclusion of the higher order seems very difficult .",
    "moreover , it is not certain if the @xmath22 expansion is a proper expansion",
    ". thus we have to investigate the problem from a different point of view .",
    "self - consistent treatments of anderson transition were developed by vollhardt and woelfle ,  @xcite and by the present author .",
    "@xcite although those theories contributed to the deeper understanding of the problem , they give @xmath46 like the renormalization group theory with the @xmath0-function ( [ beta2 ] ) .",
    "those theories are based on the requirement of the consistency between @xmath47 and @xmath30 in the integrand ( cooperon propagator ) in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) for @xmath48 . in this paper",
    "we require the consistency including the @xmath8 dependence of these quantities .    in this sense eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) is not self - consistent , for @xmath34 depends on @xmath8 while @xmath30 is a constant .",
    "the diffusion coefficient must be independent of @xmath49 for small @xmath49 , but it can depend on @xmath49 for large @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we assume that the diffusion coefficient behave like @xmath50 for large @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the case when @xmath51 is large in some sense .",
    "then , assuming that the cooperon propagator is proportional to @xmath52 , and putting it into eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) we find that @xmath53 if we neglect the terms independent of @xmath8 .",
    "we identify @xmath51 with @xmath49 , and from the self - consistency requirement we find that @xmath54 and that the diffusion coefficient should behave like @xmath55 for large @xmath49 .",
    "scaling arguments predict a different @xmath49 dependence for large @xmath49 ,  @xcite and this problem will be discussed in the last section .",
    "thus , among various possibilities , we assume a simple form for the cooperon propagator : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a numerical constant to be determined self - consistently , and @xmath58 the combination of @xmath49 with @xmath59 is based on the scaling assumption that a length should be scaled by @xmath59 .    then , by replacing the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) with the expression ( [ difp ] ) , we obtain @xmath60\\ , .",
    "\\label{dl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in comparing it with the denominator of the expression ( [ difp ] ) , we neglect the last two terms in the square bracket .",
    "in fact , we will see that the terms independent of @xmath8 does not affect the renormalization group equation .",
    "moreover , we have to compare them in the regions @xmath61 and the @xmath8 dependence of the logarithmic term is weaker than that of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , identifying @xmath51 with @xmath49 , the self - consistency requirement gives @xmath63",
    "we will derive a renormalization group equation from eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) . here",
    "we define @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a numerical constant , and we easily find that this is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ defgl ] )",
    ". then we obtain @xmath66 and @xmath67\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath68 .",
    "we assume that the anderson transition is described by renormalization group equation .",
    "then , the right hand side of this equation have to be a universal function only of @xmath7 . from eqs .",
    "( [ lam0 ] ) , ( [ gl2 ] ) and ( [ defgl2 ] ) , we find that @xmath69 is @xmath7 without the interference correction .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to identify @xmath69 with exact @xmath7 . with this replacement , the @xmath0-function",
    "is obtained : @xmath70 where we have chosen @xmath65 so that @xmath71 .",
    "the critical index @xmath9 is obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ nu ] ) and  ( [ gc ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ beta3 ] ) we easily find that @xmath72 this value of @xmath9 agrees with that of numerical studies ,  @xcite i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "on the basis of a self - consistent consideration , we have derived a renormalization group equation for anderson transition .",
    "it gives a critical index very close to those by numerical studies .",
    "we have not intended to derive an exact result , and such a good agreement is not the most important result of the present theory .",
    "it should be noted , however , that so far the analytic methods have never given a critical index comparable with those by numerical methods , within the author s knowledge , except for the rather phenomenological theory by shapiro .",
    "@xcite    as regards the one parameter scaling , the recent numerical study by ohtsuki and slevin revealed that the critical index is little dependent on the definition of @xmath7 , i.e. , what kind of averaged conductance we take for it .",
    "@xcite this result is very important because it indicates that a simple one parameter renormalization group theory is reliable .",
    "a crucial assumption in this theory is the form of the cooperon propagator given by eq .",
    "( [ difp ] ) . as was mentioned in sec .",
    "[ self ] , scaling arguments predict that the diffusion coefficient @xmath74 should depend on @xmath49 like @xmath75 with @xmath76 at the critical point , or for such @xmath49 that @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the coherence length defined by eq .",
    "( [ defgl2 ] ) . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ gl2 ] ) we find that @xmath79 , and as regards the critical behavior of the transition , the relevant values of @xmath15 are @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the relevant region of @xmath49 is @xmath81 , and the assumption @xmath82 in this region the does not contradict to the scaling arguments .",
    "since the @xmath0-function ( [ beta3 ] ) can not be obtained by the expansion in @xmath22 , probably it is impossible to derive the @xmath55 term in the expression ( [ difp ] ) by perturbational approaches .",
    "the @xmath0-function , however , reduces to eq .",
    "( [ beta2 ] ) for @xmath83 , and it might be the reason why the @xmath22 expansion seems to work for first order . for small @xmath15 , on the other hand , the @xmath0-function ( [ beta3 ] ) does not reduce to an expected form @xmath84 , but , it does not invalidate the present results , for , as was mentioned above , the important region of @xmath15 is @xmath85 .    in this context , the weak localization theory , which was very successful in explaining the magnetoresistance in fully metallic regions  @xcite , is not affected by the introduction of @xmath55 term into the cooperon propagator , for the relevant scale of @xmath49 in that theory is @xmath86 , @xmath87 being the magnetic flux density , and is much smaller than @xmath88 .    as for the experiments ,",
    "many of them suggest that @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite however , recent careful analyses by itoh et al .",
    "indicate a possibility of @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite from a theoretical point of view , it is important to clarify the roles of electron - electron interaction .",
