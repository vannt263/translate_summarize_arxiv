    "located at a distance of 700 pc @xcite , cepheus a east is one of the nearest high - mass star formation regions . for this reason , cepheus a east like orion ,",
    "is considered an ideal laboratory for the study of the physical processes related with the formation of the massive stars .",
    "this region has a total bolometric luminosity of about 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath7 l@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "half of this luminosity is attributed to the hw2 object , the brightest radio continuum source in the field , which is considered to be a b0.5 spectral type protostar @xcite .",
    "cepheus a east contains a massive bipolar molecular outflow aligned primarily east - west @xcite , but with additional components aligned northeast - southwest @xcite .",
    "the central 2@xmath0 region contains high velocity as well as more compact extremely high velocity @xmath4co components with radial velocities ranging from @xmath950 to @xmath1070 km s@xmath11 relative to the co centroid @xcite .",
    "the axis of the extremely high velocity outflow is rotated roughly 40@xmath6 clockwise relative to the high velocity outflow on the plane of the sky .",
    "the smaller spatial extent together with the higher velocity suggests that the extremely high velocity flow traces a younger outflow component . at low velocities ,",
    "there are additional blueshifted and redshifted components centered on hw2 that are oriented northeast - southwest .",
    "this outflow complex also contains several herbig - haro objects , including the extremely bright hh 168 or ggd 37 located about 100@xmath3 due west of hw2 , and several fainter bow shocks located to the east @xcite .",
    "fainter hh objects ( hh 169 and 174 ) are located in the eastern lobe @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported several distinct soft x - ray sources within the ggd 37 flow , one near the west , and one at the far end of the flow .",
    "they concluded that ggd 37 has a luminosity in x - rays of l@xmath12 = 3 @xmath1 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath11 , and inferred a shock velocity of 620 km s@xmath11 for this object .",
    "the complexity of the outflows , their multiple orientations and velocities , and the unclear morphology of some of the shock features make cepheus a east challenging to interpret @xcite .",
    "however , the study of the kinematics , and morphology of the outflows ejected from the high - mass protostars located in cepheus a east will allow us to understand better how the massive stars form in a clustered region .",
    "recent sensitive near - infrared h@xmath5 line observations , and thermal infrared observations of this nearby massive star - forming region indicate that the massive young stellar object hw2 drives a pulsed , precessing jet that has changed its orientation by about 45@xmath6 in roughly 10@xmath7 years @xcite .",
    "this outflow thus appears to be responsible for most of the outflowing activity observed in cepheus a. the precessing outflow is possibly feed by the massive and large dusty disk located in hw2 @xcite , and is associated with a bright and powerful radio thermal jet @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the close passages of an intermediate mass companion through or near the circumstellar disk result in periods of enhanced accretion and mass loss , as well as forced precession of the disk .",
    "however , the presence of faint hh objects and molecular outflows with different orientations close to the hw2 object and towards the hh 168 object suggest that this precessing - jet model may not be the only mechanism working at this region to produce the outflowing activity .    at the moment",
    ", there have been only a few successful attempts to study the kinematics of this region after the pioneering single dish @xmath4co single dish observations made by @xcite .",
    "some examples include the extremely high angular resolution vlbi studies of water masers @xcite which sample the kinematics only sparsely , due to the maser s high selectivity , the proper motions measured in the radio jets present in this region @xcite , and the large scale sio and hco@xmath14 maps from @xcite .    in the innermost parts of cepheus a east",
    "there are multiple compact radio sources revealed mainly by sensitive very large array ( vla ) observations .",
    "for example , hw3 c / d are radio sources associated with a cluster of h@xmath5o masers located at the core of this region .",
    "they are located 5@xmath3 south of hw2 and close to the western end of a nearly continuous chain of radio sources along the southern rim of the cepheus a east radio source complex .",
    "@xcite suggested that the bulk of the cepheus a s luminosity ( @xmath2 10@xmath7 l@xmath8 ) likely arises from the radio sources hw2 and hw3 c / d that are associated with bright h@xmath5o masers .",
    "however , no submillimeter continuum emission has been detected from hw3d , leading @xcite conclude that hw3c is most likely to harbor the second most luminous and massive yso in the cepheus a east core . in this interpretation , radio source 3d may trace part of an elongated thermal jet from hw3c .    in this paper , we present high angular resolution ( sub)millimeter continuum and line observations of the region cepheus a east made with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "this is the first @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) and submillimeter continuum study of cepheus a east that contains a high angular resolution ( @xmath2 3@xmath3 ) together with a large scale mapping ( 3@xmath0 @xmath1 12@xmath0 ) . in section 2",

    "after concatenated the two data sets the resulting rms noise for the line images was around 150 mjy beam@xmath11 for each velocity channel ( 2 km s@xmath11 ) and 15 mjy for the continuum at an angular resolution of @xmath21 @xmath1 @xmath22 with a p.a .",

    ", we take as compact emission , @xmath4co molecular structures with sizes of about two or three synthesized beams .    in figures 1 and 2 ,",
    "we have distinguished the molecular material ejected by hw2 and hw3c / d with blue and red open circles for hw2 and blue and red crosses for hw3c / d .",
    "we are able to do this because of the different orientations of the molecular outflows .",
    "for example , the redshifted and blueshifted emission for the outflow from hw2 is mostly located in the west and east , respectively .",
    "the outflow powered by hw3c approximately has its redshifted side in the northeast and its blueshifted side in the west .    in figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "we show @xmath4co moment zero maps using a limited velocity window , trying therefore to reveal young molecular gas ( or gas that is closer to the exciting sources as compared to the most eastern gas ) associated with hw2 and hw3 .",
    "both maps show bipolar collimated outflows emanating from each of these sources .",
    "the molecular outflows appear to emanate from the compact submillimeter and radio sources associated with hw2 , hw3d , and hw3c . at very small scales",
    "( about 2000 au ) and in the middle of the flows , it is found the compact radio emission reported by @xcite . the radio emission associated with hw2",
    "is related to a powerful radio thermal jet with tangential velocities of about 500 @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the radio emission associated with hw3c / d , on the other hand , is still unknown .",
    "however , their spectral indices and morphologies are consistent with possible thermal jets with different orientations @xcite .",
    "no clear proper motions of the ionized gas are observed toward these sources @xcite .",
    "here , we assume that these sources are in fact extended thermal jets , however , more observations are still needed to confirm this hypothesis .        for the case of hw2",
    ", the redshifted emission is found in the southwest while blueshifted emission is in the northeast . for hw3c ,",
    "the redshifted emission is found to the east while blueshifted emission is in the west ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "there is some redshifted emission located in northeast of hw2/3 region ( figure 1 ) , maybe this is part of this bipolar outflow powered by hw3c . for hw3d , we think that the redshifted emission found to the southeast ( towards hw7 ) is related with this object , but there is no evidence from our observations of blueshifted emission towards the northwest , probably because the blueshifted outflowing material goes directly outside of the molecular cloud as it seems to be case in some others molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "this picture is consistent with the se - nw outflow traced by the water proper motions , and the orientation of the thermal jet reported by @xcite in hw3d .",
    "the small changes observed in the orientation of the different outflows found in cepheus a east can be explained by the outflows undergoing deflections , possibly due to the high density molecular cloud .",
    "a process for the deflection of an outflow has been proposed and modeled by @xcite . however ,",
    "again many more observations and theoretical studies are still needed to confirm this proposition .",
    "the@xmath4co emission arising from these outflows is also associated with h@xmath5 and radio emission located far from the energizing sources ( _ e.g. _ the zone close to hw7 and hw6 ) .",
    "this radio emission is probably produced by strong shocks in dense zones @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the outflows reported here are in agreement with the position of the multiple outflows emanating from this region proposed by @xcite , see their figure 7 .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted a value of @xmath35 = 0.1 @xmath36 g@xmath11 @xcite and assumed optically thin , isothermal dust emission , a distance to cepheus a east of 700 pc @xcite and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , with a dust temperature of 50 k for the extended millimeter object associated with hw 2/3 , deriving a dust mass of 5 solar masses . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the emission from the ionized jets is negligible because its emission depends on frequency as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the mass and linear sizes ( @xmath2 2000 au ) suggest that this dusty source ( shown in figure 1 ) is likely a large envelope surrounding the compact objects hw2 and hw3 .    for the case of the submillimeter compact sources , we found masses of about 0.5 m@xmath8 .",
    "we assumed a dust temperature of 100 k , and a dust opacity of @xmath38 = 0.15 @xmath36 g@xmath11 .",
    "the mass and linear size ( @xmath2 350 au ) of hw2 are consistent with the values obtained for the circumstellar disk reported by @xcite .",
    "however , the circumstellar disk could be not only forming a single massive star @xcite . for the case of hw3c",
    ", we suggested that the dusty object mapped here and shown in figure 3 is also a circumstellar disk that powers the east - west bipolar outflow shown in figure 4 . a more compressive discussion about this hypothesis will give in a future paper ( curiel et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we found strong and compact molecular @xmath4co line emission associated with the pulsed and precessing outflow reported by @xcite .",
    "the redshifted emission is found to the west while the blueshifted is found to the east .",
    "the blueshifted emission is mostly distributed in compact condensations that follow well the h@xmath5 emission .",
    "very close to hw2 well defined jet - like structures are observed .",
    "the redshifted emission , on the other hand , is distributed regularly forming arcs with different orientations and sizes .",
    "most of the molecular arcs are formed on the tips of the h@xmath5 bow shocks .",
    "we found @xmath4co blueshifted and redshifted emission at distances up to 1 pc away from hw2 .",
    "we do not detect @xmath4co emission from the most eastern h@xmath5 bow shock ( hh 174 ) . from our data",
    "it is not clear whether the object hh 174 was ejected from hw2 as suggested by @xcite , or maybe this was produced by hw3c / d long time ago .",
    "most of @xmath4co emission detected by @xcite and @xcite using single dishes , seems to be extended and was likely resolved out in our high resolution maps .    from our @xmath4co map , presented in figure 1 ,",
    "it is not easy to see the eastern ejections formed at different angles of the precessing outflow driving by hw2 and reported by @xcite .",
    "this is only clear near hw2 .",
    "the emission is mostly concentrated in small groups dispersed across the h@xmath5 bow shocks . in figure 5 , we show a part of the velocity cube obtained here trying to illustrate how we get the physical information of each compact condensation present in our sma data .",
    "if we plot the position angle _ vs. _ the projected distance with respect to the position of hw2 of each @xmath4co condensation found in our spectral channel cube ( see figure 6 ) , one can distinguish groups of condensations separated approximately every 10@xmath6 .",
    "this result is in very good agreement with that reported by cunningham et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and that is shown in our figure 1 . in a first approximation ,",
    "the condensations with small position angles are close to hw2 , while the condensations with large angles are far from hw2 .",
    "this is also the case for the west side of the outflow ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "for example , condensations that have pas between 40@xmath6 to 60@xmath6 are located in a range of 10@xmath3 to 20@xmath3 from hw2 ( very close of this object ) , in the other hand , condensations with pas about 93@xmath6 are far from hw2 , about 250@xmath3 . however , there are some condensations that show a large spread of distances in a small range of angles .",
    "these condensations have an average angle of 85@xmath6 and are associated with a single ejection from hw2 .",
    "the small differences between both diagrams ( figures 5 and 6 ) are probably due to inhomogeneities of the molecular cloud .",
    "the @xmath4co spots are additionally color - coded to their respective radial velocities .",

    "co condensations in different groups of position angles .",
    "the average velocity and position values show their respective error bars .",

    "co(2 - 1 ) structures from hw2 : radial velocity as a function of on - the - sky distance from the position of hw2 .",
    "note that velocities between @xmath1013 and 0 km s@xmath11 could not be investigated because of interferometric contamination with the extended molecular gas . .",
    "]    in figure 7 , we show a similar digram to that made in figure 6 , but now plotting the average position angles _ vs. _ the average radial velocities of the @xmath4co compact condensations . these average radial velocities are obtained averaging the radial velocities of each condensation that are inside of the dashed box presented in figure 6 . in this way , for one average angle in the dashed box",
    ", we have a average radial velocity .",
    "this plot reveals that the recent ejections of the outflow in average have small position angles and small radial velocities , suggesting that the outflow is thus approaching to the plane of the sky at present .",
    "the past ejections in average have large position angles and large radial velocities indicating that the outflow in the near past was probably located perpendicular to the plane of the sky .",
    "however , the condensations with the largest radial velocities also show low radial velocities .",
    "this suggests that maybe long time ago the outflow was ejecting material close to the plane of the sky as it is doing now .",
    "our plots revealed only five ejections separated by about 10@xmath6 , one more than @xcite . as mentioned earlier , from our data",
    "it is not clear that the object hh 174 was ejected from hw2 .",
    "we found very high velocity molecular gas associated with hw2 that is not presented in our figures 5 and 6 , but either this is presented in our moment zero map ( figure 1 ) .",
    "for example , in our figure 5 , this emission represents a single multicolor point in the _ ( 0,0 ) _ position that does not contribute to our findings .",
    "perhaps this high velocity material is part of very new ejections of hw2 with high velocity .",
    "the present size and orientation of the molecular outflow is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the present orientation of the outflow coincides very well with that of the powerful thermal jet @xcite .    in figure 8",
    ", we show the kinematics of the molecular gas associated with the precessing outflow powered by hw2 .",
    "this position - velocity diagram reveals that the kinematics of the multiple flows is very different of that observed in the explosive outflow in orion bn / kl and dr21 @xcite .",
    "the molecular condensations from the precessing outflow mostly stay around some place with respect to a range of velocities and show large velocity gradients , contrary to the hubble law observed in the molecular filaments arising from orion bn / kl or dr21 , see figures 2 of @xcite . in the case of orion bn / kl and dr21 , the molecular condensations move in position when the velocity change , following a linear correlation between velocity and position . in conclusion , we suggest that an energetic explosive event as the one occurred in orion bn / kl does not explain the kinematics of the multiple molecular outflows found here .",
    "the kinematics of the molecular ejections observed in the cepa hw2/3 region is better explained by the presence of a precesing outflow .    from figure 8",
    ", it is clear that the @xmath4co line emission with the largest redshifted line widths are located close to hw2 and from figure 2 one can see that the it coincides with a high density ammonia core .",
    "we have marked this region with a circle in figure 2 .",
    "we think that this high density region might be blocking part of the redshifted side of the molecular outflow creating a  shocked zone  .",
    "this `` shocked zone '' could explain why it is not observed the redshifted bow shocks with similar position angles as the blueshifted bow shocks if both sides come from the same precessing bipolar outflow .",
    "we refer again to the readers see @xcite for the physical values of this ammonia condensation .",
    "our observations revealed the presence of two east - west low - velocity bipolar outflows that are emanating from hw3c / d .",
    "the innermost parts of the outflows appear to be traced by elongated ionized thermal jets reported by @xcite ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the outflow powered by hw3d appears to be creating the zone called hw7 located to the southeast and forming some more eastern hh objects far from hw3 .",
    "the proper motions of hw7 are complex , however , @xcite suggested that they are being produced by a source to its northwest , perhaps by hw3 .",
    "this is in good agreement to what we propose here based on our @xmath4co observations . on the other hand",
    ", the blueshifted side of the outflow powered by hw3c goes to the west and seems to connect with the optical / x - ray object , know as the hh 168 or gdd 37 @xcite .",
    "hh 168 is also blueshifted @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility that the radio objects w1 - 4 @xcite are also energized by the blueshifted side of the outflow from hw3c , however , their radial velocities are still unknown .",
    "these objects show westward proper motions in the range of 120 to 280 @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite proposed that these radio objects are energized by hw3 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the object hw3d harbors an internal massive young star that powers a nw - se water maser outflow and the thermal radio jet .",
    "this source could be energizing the object hw7 and perhaps the most eastern hh objects as mentioned before .",
    "however , we do not find any submillimeter continuum emission associated with this source .",
    "perhaps this source is associated with a lower mass young stellar object and more sensitive millimeter observations are needed to reveal the dust emission associated to this protostar .",
    "we have observed the cepheus a east region using the submillimeter array .",
    "we made ( sub)millimeter line and continuum observations in a mosaicing mode of this massive star forming region .",
    "our mosaic covers a total area of about 3@xmath0 @xmath1 12@xmath0 , centered in the hw 2/3 region .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    * we report compact and high velocity @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) emission associated with the multiple east - west h@xmath5 bow shocks present in cepheus a east . blueshifted and redshifted gas emission is found towards the east as well as to the west from hw2 .",
    "receding @xmath4co features show radial velocities up to 65 @xmath34 while the approaching 12co line emission has velocities down to @xmath1055 @xmath34 .",
    "* the @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) observations suggest the presence of three large - scale east - west outflows , likely powered at small scales by the radio sources associated with the young massive protostars hw2 , hw3c and hw3d . *",
    "we confirm the precession associated with the molecular outflow powered by hw2 .",
    "our data reveal five periodic ejections of material separated approximately every 10@xmath6 .",
    "there is some evidence that this outflow had an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the sky on the past . *",
    "an energetic explosive event as the one that occurred in orion bn / kl or dr21 does not explain the kinematics of the multiple molecular outflows found here . * in our entire field ,",
    "the continuum observations only revealed a strong millimeter source associated with the hw 2/3 region .",
    "we resolved this extended dusty object in only two compact sources associated with hw2 and hw3c .",
    "these compact objects are tracing the circumstellar disks associated with these objects . * the bright optical / x - ray hh 168 object might be produced by strong shocks with the molecular cloud and arising from the outflow energized by hw3c .    in conclusion",
    ", the bipolar flows arising from hw2 and hw3c / d might explain the whole outflow activity observed in cepheus a east . however , many more observations at different wavelengths are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "in particular , future observations using other molecular species may reveal more outflows in this high - mass forming region .",
