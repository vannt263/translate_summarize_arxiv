    "the density is homogeneous and given by @xmath16 , whereas closer to the hall bar edges , the density profile increases due to the action of the side gates . in order to simplify the analysis we approximate the induced density by a step function which gives rise to two parallel conducting channels : two thin regions of width @xmath17 and density @xmath18 along the two edges of the hall bar , where the side gates have a strong influence , and a broad channel of width @xmath19 and density @xmath20 in the center of the hall bar , being only slightly influenced by an applied side gate voltage [ fig .",

    "this gives the following expression for the conductivity : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the relative width of region 1 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the relative average lever arms of the side gates in region 1 and 2 .",

    "the minimum conductivity value in graphene at the charge neutrality point has been widely discussed .",

    "an applied side gate voltage increases this value , until it almost reaches @xmath36 in the case of @xmath37 .",
    "this shows that it is possible to increase the minimum value of conductivity by creating a density gradient along the width of the conductor .",
    "besides having all side gates at the same potential , many other , more complicated configurations are possible with four side gate electrodes . here",
    "we focus on the situation where the in - plane gates are biased such that a p - n - like configuration along the hall bar arises . the same voltage is applied to side gates on opposite sides of the hall bar . for both pairs",

    "as extracted from the maximum in the magnetoresistance or the zero of the hall effect coincide only at @xmath21  v. the magnetoresistance predominately probes the area between the voltage probes .",
    "the hall signal , on the other hand , mainly depends on the density in the hall cross .",
    "the application of a side gate voltage , which has a pronounced effect along the edges of the hall bar provokes a stronger shift in @xmath12 of the longitudinal resistance than in the hall resistance .",
    "for large enough side gate voltages , plateaus in @xmath46 no longer correspond to minima in @xmath47 .",

    "finally , a sufficiently high side gate voltage destroys the plateaus in the hall resistance .",
    "our range of side gate voltages is not large enough , such that different quantum hall states were to exist along the hall bar edge and in the weakly gated region of the hall cross .",
    "[ fig:8t](c ) compares the back gate voltage position of the charge neutrality point @xmath11 measured in longitudinal and hall resistance with the shift predicted by the model described above .",
    "the resistance curves are averaged over 1v in back gate voltage , and the charge neutrality point position is then determined by searching the maximum , or the zero point respectively , of the smoothed @xmath47 and @xmath46 traces . the solid line indicates the result of the model .",
    "the slope of the line is obtained by averaging the relative lever arms of both channels weighted by their widths : @xmath48 .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the back gate voltage position of the charge neutrality point as extracted from the maximum of the magnetoresistance which is also thought to probe the entire sample .",
    "the shift of the charge neutrality point following an analysis of the hall resistance is rather small , in tune with the expectation that the side gates have little influence on the density in the hall cross itself .",
    "deviations from this behavior in both quantities for large side gate voltages are probably related to the electric field extending into the region of the voltage probes .",
    "in summary , we have shown magnetotransport measurements on a single layer graphene hall bar with additional graphene side gates . the effect of a voltage applied to all side gates in the absence of a magnetic field can be explained by a model taking into account two parallel conductors , being differently influenced by the side gates .",
    "the obtained average penetration depth of the side gate created field into the flake is @xmath49  nm .",
    "this makes side gates good candidates for the local tuning of nanostructures such as quantum point contacts and quantum dots . in the quantum hall regime",
