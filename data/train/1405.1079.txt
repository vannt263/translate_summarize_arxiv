    "local models are certain projective schemes defined over a discrete valuation ring  . when is the completion of the ring of integers of the reflex field of a shimura variety at a prime ideal , and one has a model of the shimura variety over  , the local model is supposed to govern the tale - local structure of the shimura model .",
    "this allows one to reduce questions of a local nature , such as flatness or cohen  macaulayness , to the local model , which in practice should be easier to study than the shimura model itself .",

    "they showed that their construction gives tale - local models of integral models of shimura varieties in most ( tame ) pel cases where the level subgroup at the residual characteristic @xmath0 of is a parahoric subgroup which can be described as the stabilizer of a lattice chain . in this setting , rapoport and zink @xcite had previously defined natural integral shimura models and local models in terms of explicit moduli problems based on the moduli problem of abelian varieties describing the shimura variety , but the resulting schemes are not always flat , as was first observed by pappas @xcite . in the cases where pappas and zhu showed that their construction gives local models of shimura varieties , they did so by showing that it coincides with the flat closure of the generic fiber in the rapoport  zink local model . when the rapoport  zink local model is not already flat , it remains an interesting problem to obtain a moduli description of this flat closure : the pappas ",
    "zhu schemes are themselves defined via flat closure of the generic fiber , which does not impart a ready moduli interpretation .",

    "relatedly , richarz s smoothness result and theorem [ st : main_thm ] also imply that a certain moduli problem of abelian schemes ( which is an integral model for a unitary shimura variety ) is smooth ; we make this explicit in [ ss : sh ] .",
    "while the condition defining @xmath36 can be formulated for any @xmath15 and any signature , outside of counterexample [ ceg ] , we do not know the extent to which the inclusion @xmath42 fails to be an equality . indeed pappas and rapoport have obtained a good deal of computational evidence for the flatness of @xmath32 in low rank cases , and we do not know of any counterexamples to the flatness of @xmath32 when @xmath11 is even .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in [ s : mod_prob ] we review the definition of the naive , wedge , and spin local models , and we formulate our refined condition . in [ s : special_case ] we explain counterexample [ ceg ] and reduce the proof of theorem [ st : main_thm ] to proposition [ st : x_1=0 ] , whose proof occupies [ s : proof ] . in [ s : remarks ] we collect various remarks .",
    "we show that the condition defining @xmath36 implies the kottwitz condition in [ ss : kottwitz ] , and in [ ss : wedge_power_analogs ] we formulate some analogous conditions for other wedge powers .",

    "we conclude the paper in [ ss : pel_setting ] by explaining how to formulate these conditions in the general pel setting , where they again imply the kottwitz condition and automatically hold on the flat closure of the generic fiber in the naive local model .",
    "to be clear , the conditions we formulate in [ ss : pel_setting ] will not suffice to characterize the flat closure in general , since for example they do not account for the spin condition in the ramified unitary setting .",
