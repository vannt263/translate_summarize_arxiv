    "the most numerous morphological type of galaxy among the 34 members of the local group are the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . at present",
    "there are 18 dsph galaxies known within d = 1 mpc ( van den bergh 1999 , karachentsev & karachentseva 1999 , whiting et al .",
    "four of these were only discovered within the last two years .",
    "some dsphs are seen in the direction of nearby groups ( m81 , centaurus  a ) , but only for two dsph systems , bk5n and f8d1 , membership in the m81 group was confirmed by direct distance measurements based on their resolved stellar populations ( caldwell et al.1998 ) .",
    "the local group dsph galaxies show well - established relationships between their global parameters such as absolute magnitude , central surface brightness and metal abundance . however , it is still unknown whether these relationships are the same for dwarf galaxies in different environments . in this paper",
    "we describe the structural parameters and the properties of the stellar populations of a dsph galaxy in the region of the nearby , loose sculptor group that is not in the immediate vicinity of a more massive galaxy .",
    "this dsph galaxy is eso  410-g005 ( lauberts 1982 ) , also known as fg  11 ( feitzinger & galinski 1985 ) , am  0013 - 322 ( arp & madore 1987 ) , pgc  1038 ( paturel et al .",
    "1989 ) , and kk  003 ( karachentseva & karachentsev 1998 ) .",
    "eso  410-g005 was classified as dwarf elliptical ( de ) by feitzinger & galinski ( 1985 ) , who nevertheless noted its knotty structure .",
    "karachentseva & karachentsev ( 1998 ) considered eso  410-g005 to be a sph / irr due to the presence of knots on its eastern side .",
    "miller ( 1996 ) imaged it in the h@xmath4 line and did not find any emission .",

    "( 1982 ) , maia et al .  ( 1993 ) , ct et al .  ( 1997 ) , and huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not detect eso  410-g005 in the hi 21 cm line .",
    "huchtmeier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found an upper flux limit @xmath10 mjy , which indicates a low amount of gas as typical for dsph galaxies . a digital sky survey image of eso  410-g005 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the galaxy has a slightly granulated appearance in the image with a total dimension of @xmath11 .",
    "in order to study the stellar populations of eso  410-g005 and to measure its distance , we imaged this dwarf galaxy with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "the data were obtained on 1999 august 23 with exposure times of 600  s in the f606w and f814w filters .",
    "these data were taken as part of an _ hst _ snapshot survey ( program go  8192 , pi : seitzer ) of nearby dwarf galaxy candidates from the list of karachentseva & karachentsev ( 1998 ) . fig .",
    "2 shows an image of eso  410-g005 ( both filters combined ) .",
    "the galaxy was centered on the wf3 chip . after removing cosmic ray",
    "hits we measured instrumental magnitudes using the midas implementation of the daophot crowded - field photometry program ( stetson et al .",
    "the standard daophot ii / allstar procedure was used for automatic star finding and then measure stellar magnitudes by fitting a point- spread function ( psf ) in each filter for each wf chip .",
    "the psf photometry was made for about 6200 stars in both filters with an aperture radius of 1.5 pixels .",
    "the f606w and f814w instrumental magnitudes were first transformed to the holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) 0@xmath125 aperture magnitudes by determining the aperture correction that need to be applied to the psf magnitudes .",
    "typically 10  50 of the brightest , most isolated stars spread across each wf image were used .",
    "we found the mean aperture corrections to be in the range of 0.43  0.46 mag ( f606w ) and 0.49  0.52 mag ( f814w ) .",
    "we then used equations 1a , 1b , and 3 from whitmore et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to correct the magnitudes for the charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) loss , which depends on the x- and y- positions , the background counts , the brightness of the stars and the time of the observations . for our data with typical background counts of  65 e ( f606w ) and 35 e ( f814w )",
    "the mean cte correction makes a star brighter by 0.11 mag and bluer by 0.02 mag relative to the uncorrected magnitudes .",
    "finally , the f606w and f814w instrumental magnitudes were converted to the standard @xmath13 system following the `` synthetic '' transformations of holtzman et al .",
    "we used the parameters of transformations from their table 10 taking into account different relations for blue and red stars separately . because we used the non - standard @xmath14 filter f606w instead of f555w ,",
    "the resulting @xmath15 and especially @xmath14 magnitudes may contain systematic errors .",
    "however , when comparing our \\{f606w , f814w } photometry of other snapshot targets with ground - based @xmath13 photometry we find that the transformation uncertainties , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are within 0.1 mag for stars with colors of @xmath18 .",
    "finally , objects with goodness of fit parameters @xmath19sharp@xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath19chi@xmath21 2 , and @xmath22 mag were excluded .",
    "the resulting color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in @xmath15 , @xmath23 for @xmath242500 stars are presented in fig .",
    "the first panel of fig .  3 represents a cmd for the central wf3 field , which covers the main body of eso  410-g005 .",
    "the next panel shows the cmd for the neighboring regions in the southern half of wf2 and the eastern half of wf4 ( the `` medium '' field ) , and the last panel contains stars found in the remaining outer halves of wf2 and wf4 . in the central field",
    "the number of stars increases abruptly at @xmath25 , which we interpret as the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) .",
    "the same feature is seen also in the medium field , which corresponds to the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "no bright blue stars with @xmath26 are present in the medium field .",
    "this allows us to estimate a lower limit for the most recent star formation episode . using the bertelli et al.(1994 ) isochrones and adopting the distance and",
    "mean abundance from the next sections for eso  410-g005 , the absence of bright blue stars indicates that no star formation has occurred in the galaxy halo for the last 300  myr .",
    "a significant number of red stars with @xmath27 is evident in the central field .",
    "these are probably upper asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars indicating the presence of an intermediate - age population ( @xmath28 gyr ) .",
    "one can also see many faint , bluish stars with @xmath29 in the central field .",
    "these stars may be indicative of a young population in the core of eso  410-g005 .",
    "centrally concentrated intermediate - age populations and in some cases young populations have been found in a number of other dsphs as well ( see grebel 1999 for a review )",
    ". however , the blue wing of the cmd and the candidate agb stars may instead be artifacts of crowding in the central part of the galaxy ( e.g. , grillmair et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to check the significance of stellar crowding we carried out simulations in which we added artificial stars in the central ( @xmath30 pixels ) part of the galaxy using the addstar routine",
    "for each pair of @xmath15 magnitude and @xmath23 color listed in the left side of table 1 we inserted one hundred randomly distributed artificial `` stars '' , and then applied the same daophot detection and photometry algorithms as before .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  4 and table 1 .",
    "we can conclude from these simulations that at @xmath31 the detection rate has dropped to 50% .",
    "the scatter of colors for the detected stars increases towards faint magnitudes , following roughly the rgb ridge line .",
    "a noticeable fraction of artificial stars is situated above the trgb , but a few of the simulated stars have colors bluer than @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the effect of stellar blending in the central galaxy region may partially be responsible for the presence of stars with @xmath33 mag in the cmd of eso  410-g005 .",
    "the results in table 1 indicate also that the position of the trgb shifts to a brighter (  0.10 mag ) and bluer (  0.04 mag ) magnitude due to stellar crowding .",
    "the same effect has been shown by madore & freedman ( 1995 ) .",
    "thus , in transforming the wf3 photometry to the standard @xmath13 system we applied a zero point shift of @xmath34 mag and @xmath35 in the sense of fainter magnitudes and redder colors , which reduced a slight difference between the trgb positions in the central and the medium parts of eso 410-g005 .",
    "according to da costa  & armandroff ( 1990 ) , the trgb can be assumed to be at @xmath36 for metal - poor systems .",
    "we find the apparent magnitude of the trgb of eso  410-g005 to be @xmath37 .",
    "the one - sigma error here is determined roughly by estimating a scatter in position of the sharp rise in the @xmath15-band luminosity function of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "5 ) under different manner of binning . with a galactic extinction along the line of sight toward eso  410-g005 of @xmath38 ( schlegel et al .  1998 ) this yields a distance modulus of @xmath39 or @xmath40 mpc .",
    "the quoted errors include uncertainties of the synthetic transformation ( @xmath240.10 ) and crowding effects ( @xmath240.10 ) .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "3a are globular cluster fiducials from da costa  & armandroff ( 1990 ) , which were reddened and shifted to the galaxy s distance .",
    "the fiducials cover a range of [ fe / h ] values ( from left to right ) : @xmath41 dex ( m15 ) , @xmath42 dex ( m2 ) , and @xmath43 dex ( ngc1851 ) .",
    "with knowledge of the distance modulus of eso  410-g005 we can estimate its mean metallicity from the mean color of the red giant branch ( rgb ) measured at an absolute magnitude @xmath44 , as described by da costa  & armandroff ( 1990 ) .",
    "based on a gaussian fit to the color distribution of the giant stars in the range @xmath45 we derive a mean dereddened color of the rgb stars of @xmath46 .",
    "the reddening towards eso  410-g005 is @xmath47 .",
    "following lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) this yields a mean metallicity @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath48 = ( @xmath49 ) dex .",
    "however , this uncertainty must be considered an intrinsic error .",
    "further error sources come from the effect of stellar crowding ( @xmath240.04 ) and an uncertainty of the transformation zeropoint for the @xmath14 magnitudes , and hence the @xmath50 colors ( @xmath240.10 ) . added in quadrature",
    "they give a total uncertainty @xmath51 or @xmath52[fe / h ] = 0.4 dex .",
    "the radial distribution of the surface brightness in the @xmath14 band averaged over azimuth is shown in the right panel of fig .  6 .",
    "the left panel reproduces the radial variation of the @xmath50 color also averaged in azimuth . in a distance interval",
    "@xmath53 the surface brightness profile is well approximated by an exponential fit with a scale length @xmath54 .",
    "the observed central surface brightness is @xmath7  mag  arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "the mean galaxy color becomes slightly redder towards the periphery of the galaxy .",
    "this may be caused by a radial age gradient in eso  410-g005 ( see section [ sect_cmd ] ) .",
    "the galaxy s total color index , @xmath55 , is determined as the difference of integral magnitudes in each band within a radius of 35@xmath56 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the result by miller ( 1994 ) of @xmath57 from ground - based ccd photometry .",
    "furthermore , miller ( 1994 ) found @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and lauberts  & valentijn ( 1989 ) measured @xmath60 inside the standard 25 mag arcsec@xmath8 isophote . with the distance and extinction estimates from section [ sect_dist ] , we can derive the integrated absolute magnitude of eso  410-g005 : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "a summary of the basic parameters of eso  410-g005 is given in table 2 .",
    "the data in the first six lines are from nasa s extragalactic database",
    "the total @xmath63 and @xmath14 magnitudes were adopted from miller ( 1994 ) , while the other listed parameters , except for the extinction value , are from this paper .",
    "the symmetric shape of the galaxy , its smooth surface brightness profile , the reddish total colors , the lack of an appreciable amount of neutral hydrogen , and the absence of a significant young population favor the classification of eso  410-g005 as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "the integrated absolute magnitude of eso  410-g005 and its standard linear diameter , 0.72 kpc , correspond to the parameters typical for spheroidal companions of the milky way and m31 . as seen from fig .",
    "7 , the derived parameters of eso  410-g005 follow the general relationships between central surface brightness , @xmath64 , absolute magnitude , and the mean metallicity defined by local group dwarfs ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 , grebel  & guhathakurta 1999 ) .",
    "we searched for globular clusters in eso  410-g005 but found no candidates within the appropriate range of colors and magnitudes defined by milky way globulars ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "this null result is not surprising given the expected value of the specific frequency of globular clusters in low - luminosity dsph and de galaxies ( harris  & van den bergh 1981 ; miller et al .",
    "1998 ) .    on the eastern side of eso  410-g005",
    "there is a group of diffuse , extended objects ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "these objects are the `` knots '' that had been detected earlier from the ground ( section [ sect_intro ] ) .",
    "integral magnitudes for them as well as their colors , central surface brightnesses and half - light radii are given in table 3 .",
    "two of the brightest objects have faint external features resembling tidal tails ( fig .",
    "judging from their morphology and color these objects seem to be members of a group of background galaxies .",
    "eso  410-g005 is located in the direction of the loose group of galaxies in sculptor , very close to the supergalactic equator ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "several multiple galaxy systems situated at different distances overlap with each other along the line of sight in this complicated region ( jerjen et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the wide vicinity of eso  410-g005",
    "there are 12 galaxies with distance estimates @xmath66 mpc or with radial velocities @xmath67 km s@xmath68 , where @xmath69 is measured relative to the barycenter of the local group ( karachentsev  & makarov 1996 ) .",
    "these galaxies are listed in table 4 , which is an updated version of table 5 from jerjen et al .",
    "the sky distribution of these galaxies is shown in fig .",
    "large and small filled squares correspond to luminous and dwarf late - type galaxies , respectively , and open squares indicate four dsph galaxies .",
    "the two bright spiral galaxies ngc55 and ngc300 are both at the near side of the elongated sculptor group . it has been suggested that ngc55 and ngc300 form a bound pair ( graham 1982 , pritchet et al .  1987 , whiting 1999 ) .",
    "the distance of ngc55 is poorly known .",
    "distance estimates for ngc55 range from 1.34 mpc based on carbon stars ( pritchet et al .",
    "1987 ) to 1.66 mpc from the tully - fisher relation ( puche  & carignan 1988 ) .",
    "davidge ( 1998 ) finds ngc55 and ngc300 to be at a @xmath70 larger distance modulus than the lmc , i.e. , at @xmath71 mpc .",
    "the distance to ngc300 was measured via cepheids ( freedman et al .",
    "1992 : ( @xmath72 ) mpc ) and via the planetary nebulae luminosity function ( soffner et al .  1996 : ( @xmath73 ) mpc ) . in projection eso",
    "410-g005 is closest to ngc55 ( see table 3 and fig .  8 ; ngc7793 is much more distant ) .",
    "the dwarfs eso  410-g005 as well as pgc  1641 and possibly pgc  621 may be remote companions of the bright galaxy pair .",
    "eso  410-g005 has a linear projected separation of ( @xmath74 ) kpc from ngc55 ( assuming that ngc55 is at the same distance as eso  410-g005 ) .",
    "the deprojected distance of eso  410-g005 ranges from 340 kpc to 615 kpc , depending on whether puche  & carignan s ( 1988 ) or pritchet et al.s ( 1987 ) distance to ngc55 is considered .",
    "the formal errors of these values are @xmath75 and @xmath76 kpc when taking the uncertainties in the galactocentric distance determinations to ngc55 and eso  410-g005 into account",
    ". however , eso  410-g005 can not be closer to ngc55 than its linear projected separation , which gives a lower limit to their true separation within the sculptor group .",
    "the linear projected separation between eso  410-g005 and ngc300 is @xmath77 kpc if both galaxies were at the distance of eso  410-g005 . the deprojected distance between these two objects is ( @xmath5 ) kpc when we adopt the cepheid distance for ngc300 . as before the linear separation gives a better lower limit to their true separation .",
    "ngc55 has a 56 times lower luminosity and mass than m31 or the milky way , and ngc300 is slightly more luminous than ngc55 .",
    "all dsph companions of the two large local group spirals are concentrated within a radius of 300 kpc .",
    "there is only one case of an isolated dsph in the local group known , namely tucana .",
    "( the recently discovered dsph cetus is close to both wlm and ic1613 ) . considering the lower mass of ngc55 relative to m31 or the milky way",
    ", eso  410-g005 seems to be located between ngc300 and ngc55 and may be a relatively isolated dsph within the sculptor group . a more accurate distance determination for ngc55 is required to determine its location with respect to eso  410-g005 .",
    "based on @xmath78 images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ we have resolved the dwarf spheroidal galaxy eso  410-g005 into stars .",
    "knotty structures in this galaxy visible in ground - based images are identified as a probable distant background cluster of galaxies .",
    "the cmd for @xmath242500 stars shows the presence of a red giant branch with @xmath79 , which yields a true distance modulus of @xmath80 or @xmath81 mpc .",
    "the galaxy s global parameters , namely the absolute magnitude of @xmath82 , the standard linear diameter of @xmath83 = 0.72 kpc , the central surface brightness of @xmath84 mag arcsec@xmath8 , and the mean metal abundance @xmath2[fe / h]@xmath48 = @xmath85 dex are within the range of properties observed for dsph companions of the milky way and m31 .",
    "in addition to rgb stars , the cmd for the central part of eso  410-g005 shows a considerable number of brighter red stars ( candidate upper agb stars ) and also some blue stars .",
    "there are two possible explanations of what these objects are : blends of fainter stars due to crowding , or members of a centrally concentrated intermediate - age population .",
    "the radial variation of the integrated color of eso  410-g005 seems to be an independent line of evidence in support a younger population in the center .",
    "eso  410-g005 appears to lie between the closest sculptor group spirals ngc55 and ngc300 .",
    "the projected distance between eso  410-g005 and the moderately massive spiral ngc55 is 230 kpc ( assuming that ngc55 were at the same distance as eso  410-g005 ) , and 330 kpc if ngc300 were at the same distance as eso  410-g005 . the deprojected separation between eso  410-g005 and ngc55 ranges from 340 to 615 kpc depending on the adopted distance of ngc55 .",
    "when ngc300 s cepheid distance is adopted then its deprojected distance from eso  410-g005 is ( @xmath5 ) kpc . all these deprojected distances are larger than the largest separations between the dsph companions of m31 and the milky way in the local group , and ngc55 and ngc300 are less massive than the dominant local group spirals .",
    "eso  410-g005 may therefore be a relatively isolated dsph within the sculptor group .",
