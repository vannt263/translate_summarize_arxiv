    "the measurement of the successive harmonics of azimuthal correlations in a heavy ion collision @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the impact parameter direction , is of paramount importance , since it yields information on the medium created in the collision . in particular ,",
    "a novel behaviour has been predicted for the first harmonic @xmath2 , the so - called _ directed flow _ , at ultrarelativistic energies @xcite .    however , the analysis of directed flow at these energies is highly nontrivial , because @xmath2 is very small .",
    "thus , methods based on an analysis of two - particle azimuthal correlations  @xcite are likely to be biased by `` nonflow '' two - particle correlations : quantum ( hbt ) correlations between identical particles and correlations due to global momentum conservation have been shown to be important at sps  @xcite , while correlations due to minijets may be large at rhic @xcite . on the other hand , methods relying on four - particle correlations @xcite , which are free from this bias , are plagued by a lack of statistics due to the smallness of @xmath2 , although they give good results for the analysis of elliptic flow @xmath3 ( see sec .",
    "[ s : elliptic ] ) . to remedy these shortcomings , we proposed a new method of @xmath2 analysis @xcite , based on the measurement of a _",
    "mixed _ three - particle correlation , which involves both @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the azimuths of three particles belonging to the same event , and the average runs over triplets of particles emitted in the collision , and over events .",
    "once @xmath3 has been obtained from a separate analysis , this equation yields @xmath8 , thus @xmath2 .    here",
    ", we apply this method to na49 data on pb - pb collisions at 158 @xmath9gev .",
    "results obtained using the `` standard '' flow analysis are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our method , the first step in the analysis is the measurement of a reference @xmath3 .",
    "then , an equation analogous to eq .  [ principe ] yields an estimate of the _ integrated _",
    "@xmath2 , i.e. , its average value over some phase space region . finally , restricting @xmath10 in eq .",
    "[ principe ] to a small @xmath11 bin allows one to obtain more detailed , _ differential _ measurements of @xmath2 as a function of transverse momentum or rapidity .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our method of analysis of directed flow @xmath2 requires the preliminary knowledge of an estimate of the elliptic flow @xmath3 , integrated over some phase space region .",
    "of course , this estimate must be obtained by analysing the same sample of events from which one wants to extract @xmath2 .    in practice ,",
    "the average over phase space is a _ weighted _ average : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the chosen weight . in order to reduce statistical fluctuations",
    ", @xmath13 must be larger for particles with stronger elliptic flow .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is obtained using the cumulant method described in ref .",
    "@xcite : one can extract estimates of @xmath14 from cumulants of multi- ( 2- , 4- , 6-  ) particle correlations . while two - particle methods are equivalent to the standard flow analysis , higher orders are essentially free from nonflow effects .",
    "they were first used in analysing data obtained by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2(b ) ] , we present application of the method to na49 data , and show the dimensionless quantity @xmath15 as a function of centrality for charged particles , where we have used @xmath16 .",
    "we display estimates using cumulants of two- , four- , six- , and even eight - particle correlations @xcite , as well as the corresponding quantity for charged pions obtained from the `` standard '' subevent method @xcite .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the four- , six- , and eight - particle estimates all agree : this supports the idea that they are indeed free from nonflow effects , and correspond to a genuine collective motion in the direction of the impact parameter .",
    "moreover , these multiparticle estimates show a slight discrepancy with the two - particle values , as expected if nonflow correlations are sizable @xcite",
    ". please note that the statistical uncertainties on high order cumulants remain reasonably small , especially for midcentral collisions . in the following",
    ", our reference elliptic flow value will preferably be the estimate from the four - particle cumulant , which is a priori the most reliable since it is free from nonflow correlations and has a smaller statistical error than higher order estimates .",
    "the next step in the analysis is to determine the average value of directed flow over some phase space region . as in the case of elliptic flow",
    ", we perform a weighted average @xmath17 where stronger weight is given to particles with stronger directed flow . in the na49 analysis , we used a rapidity dependent weight @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the centre - of - mass rapidity .",
    "this weighted average is obtained from the following three - particle correlation : @xmath20 where @xmath13 is the same as in sec .",
    "[ s : elliptic ] . using the value of @xmath14 obtained in sec .",
    "[ s : elliptic ] , we thus derive @xmath21 , up to a global sign .    in practice , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ c3&flow ] is constructed using a generating function formalism detailed in ref .",
    "this procedure is a very efficient way to sum over all possible triplets of particles , and also to remove automatically the effects of slight detector anisotropies .",
    "the method was applied to na49 data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v1(b ) ] , we present as a function of centrality the dimensionless quantity @xmath22 , analogous to eq .",
    "[ dimensionless ] , together with two- and four - particle estimates obtained with the method of ref .",
    "it is worth noting that the statistical uncertainty on the three - particle estimate is barely larger than that on the two - particle value , while the systematic error due to nonflow correlations ( not included in the plot ) is a priori much smaller .     of charged particles as a function of centrality ( central left , peripheral right ) . ]     of charged particles as a function of centrality",
    "( central left , peripheral right ) . ]",
    "finally , we want to obtain detailed measurements of @xmath2 , as a function of @xmath23 or @xmath24 and for each particle type .",
    "to derive @xmath25 , we use a three - particle correlation analogous to eq .",
    "[ c3&flow ] , where the particle labeled @xmath26 is restricted to a narrow @xmath11 bin : @xmath27 with the previously derived @xmath28 and @xmath29 , this equation yields @xmath25 .",
    "we illustrate this method on the differential flow of charged pions in midcentral collisions , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : v1(pt ) ] and [ fig : v1(y ) ] together with two two - particle estimates , either uncorrected or corrected for the effect of momentum conservation  @xcite .    at high @xmath23 , @xmath2 from three - particle correlations",
    "is consistent with the two - particle value corrected for momentum conservation , but significantly lower than the uncorrected one .",
    "this shows that correlations from momentum conservation , which are large , are automatically removed in our method .",
    "this is also reflected by the behaviour at midrapidity , where @xmath2 vanishes , as it should by symmetry , while the uncorrected two - particle estimate does not .",
    "the three - particle estimate also vanishes more smoothly at @xmath30 than two - particle estimates which may be biased by hbt correlations  @xcite .     of charged pions as a function of @xmath31 for midcentral collisions .",
