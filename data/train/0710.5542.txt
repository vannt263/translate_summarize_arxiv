    "the closest star to the solar system , alpha centauri , is a triple system , so is polaris and hd 188753 .",
    "triple stars and black holes are common in globular clusters  @xcite , and galactic disks . triple black hole mergers can be formed in galaxy merger  @xcite and a triple quasar , representing a triple supermassive black hole system has been recently discovered  @xcite .",
    "full numerical simulations of black holes made possible only in the last couple of years have already produced numerous astrophysically interesting results , among them , the orbital hangup and respect of the cosmic censorship hypothesis for spinning black holes  @xcite , precession and spin - flips  @xcite , and the discovery  @xcite of large recoil velocities in highly - spinning black hole mergers up to @xmath3 km / s  @xcite .",
    "the 2005 breakthroughs in numerical relativity  @xcite , not only provided a solution to the long standing two - body problem in general relativity , but it also proved applicable to the black hole - neutron star binaries  @xcite and recently to the three ( and @xmath0 ) - black holes systems  @xcite",
    ".    in general , the solution of three - body problem in newtonian gravity can be chaotic .",
    "there are however , periodic orbits in the problem of three equal masses on a plane",
    ". one of the most surprising solution is a figure - eight orbit .",
    "the three bodies chase each other forever around a fixed eight - shaped curve .",
    "this was found first by moore  @xcite and discussed with the proof of the existence in ref .",
    "heggie  @xcite also estimates the probability for such systems to occur in a galaxy .    because of effects such as the perihelion shift , it was unclear if the figure - eight orbits would exist in a low post - newtonian expansion , even if it consist of only conservative terms .",
    "imai , chiba and asada succeeded in obtaining the figure - eight solution in a first post - newtonian order approximation by finding the general relativistic corrections to the newtonian initial conditions . in ref .",
    "@xcite they also estimated the periodic gravitational waves from this system .    in ref .",
    "@xcite was used the euler - lagrange equations of motion in an approximation to first post - newtonian order . in our paper",
    "we instead assume the hamiltonian formulation to derive the equations of motion .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( with typos corrected in our appendix ) .",
    "we derive the equations of motion in this formalism , which are different from those used in ref .",
    "@xcite and have the virtue of explicitly satisfying the constants of motion of the problem , and thus being more amenable to numerical integration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : eom ] , we summarize the equations of motion to be solved numerically in order to obtain the figure - eight orbits . the starting point is the three - body hamiltonian in the first post - newtonian approximation . in section  [ sec:1pn ] , we discuss the initial conditions for the figure - eight solutions .",
    "we study the scaling relation between the orbital radius and the linear momenta . from this analysis",
    ", we can estimate when general relativistic effects are important . in section  [ sec:2pn ] , we extend our calculation to the second post - newtonian order and in section  [ sec : dis ] , we summarize the results of this paper and discuss some remaining problems .",
    "the 2pn three - body hamiltonian is explicitly given in the appendix . throughout this paper",
    ", we use units in which @xmath4 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the newtonian configuration that leads to orbital braid figures can also be obtained within the lagrangian approach , in the first post - newtonian approximation , by finding the appropriate corrections to the initial data  @xcite .    here",
    "we will consider the hamiltonian formulation since it generates equations of motion that conserve the energy , linear and angular momenta .",
    "this is crucial to reach high accuracy in the numerical integrations , which is needed to keep good track of the orbital motion , that in the three body problem might be chaotic .",
    "the hamiltonian ( @xmath5 ) for the three body problem in the second post - newtonian approximation is given next .",
    "note that since gravitational radiation only enters at @xmath6-order and higher , the current analysis applies to conservative systems .",
    "the newtonian hamiltonian is given by @xmath7 and to the first post - newtonian order by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 run over @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we have used the notations ; @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the dot ( @xmath17 ) means the inner product .",
    "the hamiltonian for the second post - newtonian order is given in the appendix .",
    "we then obtain the canonical equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "explicitly , the equation of motion for the first post - newtonian order , are given for the particle 1 by @xmath22 where to obtain the equation of motion for the particle 2 ( and 3 ) , we change the subscripts as @xmath23 ( and @xmath24 ) , respectively .",
    "we solved the above equations numerically for three body problems using a 10 digits precision implemented in _ maple _ 10 with typical runs of a few seconds on a laptop .",
    "since we use the canonical momentum in the calculation , the hamiltonian @xmath25 , the total linear momentum @xmath26 and angular momentum @xmath27 are conserved quantities .",
    "these represent useful checks of the accuracy of the numerical runs .",
    "in the newtonian case , a figure - eight motion can be obtained from the following initial conditions  @xcite , i.e. , the positions @xmath28 and linear momenta @xmath29 : @xmath30 here , we set @xmath31 . for the above initial condition ,",
    "the total linear momentum and angular momentum are zero .    at the 1pn order",
    ", we also impose the total linear momentum @xmath32 and the total angular momentum @xmath33 . by these conditions ,",
    "we find that each linear momentum is given by the relations @xmath34 therefore , when we give the positions of the three particles , and it is necessary then only to search numerically for @xmath35 . in order to obtain , @xmath35 ,",
    "we make some iterative computations until the figure - eight is reproduced for a few orbits .    in figures  [ fig : h_ica ] and [ fig : h_h ] we show the relative error of the hamiltonian conservation : @xmath36 figure  [ fig : h_ica ] is estimated by using the orbit calculated in @xcite and we observe that they lead to violations of the order of @xmath37 . while , figure  [ fig : h_h ] is derived by using the canonical equations derived in our paper and they display errors of the order of @xmath38 , growing linearly in time due to the propagation of numerical errors triggered by initial roundoff .    next we will discuss the scaling behavior of @xmath39 when we change the initial separation as @xmath40 , and hence the size of the orbit . note that @xmath41 in the newtonian limit as can be easily derived from the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hn ] ) or the equations of motion  ( [ eq : eom1pn ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab : results ] , we summarize our numerical findings for the @xmath42 initial conditions for @xmath43 from 1 to 100 . we note that @xmath35 with @xmath44 is different from the value which are derived from the initial velocity of @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath45 in the table is the inclination angle of the principal axes .",
    "the principal axes of the 1pn figure - eight motion are not along the x and y axes  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] , the figure - eight rescaled orbits with @xmath46 and @xmath47 are shown . here , in order to display the general relativistic effects , we have used the coordinates : @xmath48 .",
    "we have chosen here the x - axis as the principal axis .",
    "we observe that the superposition of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 is suggestive that at those scales the general relativistic effects are very small while for @xmath51 they are dominant , but remainder gauge effects may also mask this effect because the orbits are not gauge invariant .",
    "a cleaner analysis can be made directly looking at the initial linear momenta scaling .",
    ".the initial conditions and inclination angle . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we summarize the results by showing the difference between the newtonian , first and second post - newtonian results in figure  [ fig : n12 ] .",
    "the second post - newtonian effect is small but clearly not negligible for @xmath44 .",
    "in this paper we have used the figure - eight orbits as a theoretical lab to test the properties of the low post - newtonian expansions of general relativity .",
    "we have found that those closed orbits exists for three ( and presumably @xmath0 ) bodies . we have provided an improved first - post - newtonian order formalism for deriving the equations of motion that satisfy the hamiltonian ( the linear and angular momenta ) constraint to round - off error .",
    "the subsequent numerical evolution is well behaved during for more than @xmath52 .",
    "we have also extended this analysis to the @xmath53 corrections , still giving a conservative system of equations . in the process of finding the figure - eight solutions by trial of different initial momenta we also showed ( numerically ) the stability of the orbit against small perturbations .",
    "this method is particularly useful to determine , dynamically ( as an alternative to determine them through families of initial data  @xcite ) , initial orbital parameters for subsequent full numerical evolution  @xcite , when the holes are close enough that general relativistic effects can no longer be ignored .",
    "note that our method fully takes into account the three - body post - newtonian interactions unlike other simulations that approximate the problem in successive two - body problems  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the scaling fits  ( [ eq:2pnfit ] ) give a practical way to determine when relativistic or newtonian approaches are appropriate .",
    "for @xmath44 we have that the ratio of the first coefficient , @xmath54 ( newtonian ) to the second coefficient @xmath55 first - post - newtonian is nearly @xmath56 and the second coefficient to the third one @xmath57 ( dominated by second - post - newtonian ) is also approximately @xmath56 .",
    "this indicates that post - newtonian corrections are important . for @xmath44",
    "the distance between the initial bodies is @xmath58 , what indicates that for nearly @xmath59 with @xmath60 the total mass of the system has strong post - newtonian effects . for @xmath61 newtonian gravity should describe the system accurately , while for @xmath62 general relativistic effects should be very important , eventually leading to the total collapse of the system .",
    "it is interesting to remark here that most of the @xmath0-body codes use some sort of regularization of the newtonian gravity for very close encounters @xcite , instead the natural way to regularize these close encounters @xcite is given by the general theory of relativity , and as we show here , the post - newtonian corrections are already non - negligible at separations of the order of @xmath1 . in any case , for most of the astrophysical encounters this is way too short distance , but it can obviously be reached in systems involving black holes and neutron stars .",

    "in this appendix , we give explicitly the hamiltonian for the three body problem at second post - newtonian order in the adm gauge since there are some typos in the summation of  @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion used in our paper can be derived straightforwardly from this hamiltonian , but are too cumbersome to write down here ."
