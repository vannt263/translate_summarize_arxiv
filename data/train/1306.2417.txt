    "there have been significant recent interests on the optical force in photonic nano - structures @xcite , such as coupled waveguides system @xcite , coupled resonator - waveguide systems @xcite , or coupled resonators systems @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "the optical force is strong enough to change the static mechanical configurations of photonic nanostructures @xcite .",
    "as one set of examples we note the demonstrations of the bending of optical waveguides , either by the optical force between two parallel waveguides @xcite , or the force between a resonator and a feeding waveguide @xcite .",
    "another example is the change in the separation between two coupled resonators due to the optical force between them @xcite .",
    "these changes in mechanical configurations can be used to optically tune the systems frequency response @xcite , to corral the resonators into an optical equilibrium @xcite , as a basis for a non - volatile optical memory @xcite , or to couple light with mechanical modes @xcite .    in",
    "most of aforementioned systems , at each operating point , the optical force is non - vanishing , i.e. it is either attractive or repulsive but never zero .",
    "the equilibrium points of structures are set by the balance between the force due to the optical fields , and the forces that are purely mechanical in origin @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to explore whether it is possible to achieve an equilibrium just by using the optical force alone .",
    "we refer to such an equilibrium that arises purely by using optical force alone as an `` optical equilibrium '' for the rest of the paper .",
    "@xcite has shown that it is indeed possible to achieve such a pure optical equlibrium between two resonators ; for a given operating frequency , the optical force has an equilibrium point ; the optical force is repulsive for a small separation between the two resonators , and attractive for a large separation . ref .",
    "@xcite has further demonstrated the importance of such a pure optical equilibrium for creating optical circuits that are self - tuned and self - stablized .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the possibility of creating an optical equilibrium in the waveguide - resonator system .",
    "we analytically and numerically study the lateral force in the system of a resonator side - coupled to a feeding waveguide ( example in fig .",
    "we find that an optical equilibrium can not occur if the resonator supports only a single resonance in the vicinity of the operating frequency . instead , in order to have an equilibrium , the system has to be have at least two resonances that overlap in frequency .",
    "we provide detailed discussion of the requirements of these resonances in order to create an optical equlibrium in the waveguide - resonator systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze a waveguide - resonator system where the resonator supports a single resonance , and show analytically that no optical equilibrium can occur .",
    "we then verify this analysis with numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "iii , we proceed to two - resonance systems and explain intuitively how to achieve an optical equilibrium in these systems .",
    "we also provide simulation results of two - resonance systems which confirm our intuitive arguments .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",
    "in this section , we first review the theory of the waveguide - resonator force in a single - resonance system by deriving an analytic expression for the optical force as a function of the couplings and the resonance frequency .",
    "then , we study the existence of the optical equilibrium by studying how force changes as a function of the distance between the resonator and the waveguide .    to describe the system in fig .",
    "1a we consider the model as depicted in fig .",
    "1b . in this model ,",
    "the resonator has a single resonance at the resonance frequency of @xmath0 .",
    "the light , at a frequency @xmath1 , enters the system through the waveguide , which couples to the resonator with a coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "the light can exit from the resonator to the output port of the waveguide .",
    "the light can also dissipate through any loss mechanism such as material loss or radiation loss , with the loss rate @xmath3 .",
    "we will focus on the optical force between the input waveguide and the resonator . by using the coupled - mode theory for a travelling - wave resonance @xcite , the field enhancement factor @xmath4 ( the ratio between the resonator and input field ) and the transmission coefficient @xmath5 ( the ratio between the output and input field )",
    "are found to be @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the round trip time in the resonator , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are arbitrary phase factors depending on the positions along the waveguide where the fields are measured .    in order to find the optical force @xmath11 between the input waveguide and the resonator in this system , we use the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the power at each exit channel , @xmath14 is the output phase at that channel , and @xmath15 is the relevant distance . note that the sign is opposite from ref .",
    "@xcite because we use the @xmath16 convention . in our case",
    ", we consider the lateral force between the resonator and the waveguide , hence @xmath15 is the distance between the resonator and the input waveguide , with @xmath17 being a repulsive force . in our case , there are two exit channels : the output port of the waveguide , and the loss ; therefore , eq . [ rakicheqn ] becomes @xmath18 using eq .",
    "[ a ] and [ t ] and defining the transmission @xmath19 , we can write @xmath20 where on the last equation , we assume the loss has the same phase as the resonator field . by evaluating eq .",
    "[ sumf ] , we obtain @xmath21 where @xmath22 the results here are the same as ref . 13 but the derivation here is different .    at a given frequency @xmath1 ,",
    "a stable equilibrium occurs if there exists a resonator - waveguide separation @xmath23 such that 1 ) the lateral force is @xmath24 at @xmath23 , 2 ) the force is attractive for @xmath25 , and 3 ) the force is repulsive for @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , to study the possibility for a stable optical equilibrium , we need to study how the sign of force changes in @xmath15 at a fixed frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we will show analytically that in fact , at a fixed @xmath1 , the force can not change sign as @xmath15 varies . as a result , neither a stable nor unstable equilibrium point can be obtained from a single resonance .    to understand how the force changes with @xmath15",
    ", we need to know how @xmath2 and @xmath0 explicitly vary with @xmath15 . because the resonator and the waveguide couple evanescently , we expect @xmath2 and @xmath0 to vary with @xmath15 as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the decaying constant .",
    "@xmath29 is a positive constant .",
    "@xmath30 is the resonance frequency in the absence of the waveguide .",
    "@xmath31 is a constant that can be positive , zero , or negative , depending on the resonance s type , mode , or polarization .",
    ". [ gammae ] and [ omega0 ] will be verified numerically in the next section .    from eq .",
    "[ gammae ] and [ omega0 ] , we get @xmath32 we see that @xmath33 , hence the first term of eq .",
    "[ force ] , which is antisymmetric with respect to the resonant frequency , shows an attractive force on the lower - frequency side and a repulsive force on the higher - frequency side",
    ". however , @xmath34 can be either positive or negative , so the second term of eq .",
    "[ force ] , which is symmetric around the resonant frequency , is repulsive if @xmath35 and attractive if @xmath36 . as a result",
    ", the total force has a lineshape that is asymmetric , with the dominant sign of force depending on the sign on @xmath34 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 where we assume an over - coupling regime ( @xmath37 ) to achieve a large resonance contribution to the optical force @xcite .",
    "note that the force peaks at neither @xmath0 nor @xmath30 .    at each waveguide - resonator separation @xmath15",
    ", we now solve for the frequency @xmath38 where the force vanishes .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ force ] and [ gammae]-[gom ] , and after a few lines of algebra , we obtain a remarkable result : @xmath39 in another word , independent of the waveguide - resonator separation , the force always vanishes at the frequency @xmath40 , which is the resonance frequency of the resonator in the absence of the waveguide .",
    "moreover , since @xmath38 is independent of @xmath15 , at each frequency , the force never changes sign as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , one can not achieve an optical equilibrium in this system .",
    "also , while the results here are derived for a travelling - wave single mode resonator , we note that the form of the force spectrum , i.e. eq . [ force ] , and the dependency of various resonance parameters on @xmath15 , i.e. eqs . [ gammae]-[omega0 ] , apply to single - mode standing - wave resonator as well .",
    "therefore , the main conclusion here , that one can not achieve an optical equilibrium in the waveguide - resonator lateral force using a single - mode resonator , should in general hold .      as a concrete example to support the theory in the previous section , we consider a system comprising a racetrack - shaped ring resonator side - coupled to a waveguide as shown in fig .",
    "the waveguide and the resonator are made of silicon with permittivity @xmath41 and are surrounded by air with @xmath42 .",
    "both the waveguide and the ring has a width of 0.2 @xmath43 m . the radius of the semi - circular part of the resonator is @xmath44 m and the straight section is @xmath45 m long .",
    "the separation @xmath15 between the resonator and the waveguide will be varied in the range of @xmath46 m - @xmath47 m .",
    "the operating optical frequency corresponds to a free space wavelength near @xmath48 m . we normalize the frequency to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the light speed in vacuum , and @xmath51 m .",
    "hence a free space wavelength of @xmath52 m corresponds to an angular frequency of @xmath53 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider a 2d system in tm mode ( out - of - plane electric field and in - plane magnetic field ) .",
    "the simulation of this system is done using finite - element frequency - domain method with a commercial software comsol @xcite , and the optical force is calculated by integrating maxwell s stress tensor .",
    "first , we verify that coupled mode theory indeed applies by plotting the transmission @xmath54 as a function of frequency @xmath1 for several @xmath15 in fig .",
    "we can see that the transmission spectrum has a symmetric dip as expected .",
    "we can also deduce that @xmath34 is negative for this system because the resonance frequency decreases as @xmath15 increases .",
    "we then fit our parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 from the transmission spectrum using eq .",
    "[ t ] for each value of @xmath15 .",
    "we plot these parameters with respect to @xmath15 in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath3 is constant in @xmath15 , and @xmath2 and @xmath55 decay exponentially with approximately the same decay constant ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively ) , which verify eq . [ gammae ] and [ omega0 ] .",
    "we also found @xmath58 .",
    "next , we verify the theoretical formula for the force spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ force ] ) by examining the numerically computed force spectra as shown in fig .",
    "3c . in this plot ,",
    "the force per unit input power @xmath11 is normalized to the unit of @xmath59 .",
    "we can see that the force spectra are indeed asymmetric , with a small attractive force on the lower - frequency side and a large repulsive force on the higher - frequency side , as expected from eq .",
    "[ force ] and the sign of @xmath34 .",
    "also , while the frequency where the maximum force occurs shifts significantly as @xmath15 varies , we see that the force zero @xmath38 does not change as @xmath15 changes , as expected from our theory .    to further emphasize that an optical equilibrium can not be achieved with a single resonance , we plot the sign of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "we can see that at large waveguide - resonator separation @xmath15 where the single - resonance condition is well - satisfied , the frequency @xmath38 where the force vanishes indeed does not change as @xmath15 varies , and has the value of @xmath30 as calculated above . as a result , no equilibrium exists . at smaller",
    "@xmath15 , however , @xmath60 changes slightly as @xmath15 changes .",
    "this occurs because at low @xmath15 , the linewidth of the resonance is sufficiently large such that there is additional contribution from the adjacent resonances , and as a result our assumption of having a single resonance no longer applies . even in these cases where @xmath38 does vary as a function of d ,",
    "this deviation in @xmath38 is much smaller than the linewidth at those @xmath15 , and also smaller than the change in @xmath0 as @xmath15 changes , because the adjacent resonances are far away in frequencies .",
    "the analysis here therefore indicates that in order to achieve optical equilibrium in the waveguide - resonator system , one needs the resonator to support at least two resonances that are in close proximity to each other in frequency .",
    "building upon the understanding of the force behavior of a single resonance , in this section we will present an intuitive understanding of how an optical equilibrium can be created in two - resonance system .",
    "guided by this intuition , we then design structures that indeed achieve optical equilibrium in waveguide - resonator systems .      to construct a stable optical equilbrium , in fig .",
    "4a , consider a resonator system supporting two resonances , both with @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the two resonances are close to each other in frequency . for each resonance , the frequency @xmath38 where the force vanishes for each resonance does not vary as @xmath15 changes , and",
    "the force is attractive for @xmath62 and repulsive for @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , by assuming that the total force is the sum of the contributions from the two resonances , we see that the optical equilibrium can only occur at the frequencies between @xmath38 s of the two resonances ( shaded region in fig .",
    "4 ) , where the contributions from the two resonances are in opposite directions . next , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , a @xmath35 resonance , which has an asymmetric lineshape in its force spectrum , has a repulsive side with a larger peak amplitude , and an attractive side with a smaller peak amplitude .",
    "also , as @xmath15 increases , this repulsive peak narrows significantly , while the attractive peak changes less significantly in its width . with the arrangement in fig .",
    "4a , the force between the two @xmath38 s is a sum of the contributions of the repulsive side of the lower frequency resonance , and the attractive side of the higher frequency resonance .",
    "therefore , the way each resonance varies with @xmath15 as described above can lead to a change in the sign of force .",
    "the total force should change from repulsive to attractive as @xmath15 increases , creating a stable optical equlibrium . with a similar argument",
    ", we can see that a system with two @xmath64 resonances , as shown in fig .",
    "4b , results in an unstable optical equilibrium .",
    "guided by the intuition above , in the remaining parts of this section , we provide two concrete examples that exhibit a stable optical equilibrium .      in the first example , we modify the ring resonator in sec .",
    "ii by adding a small circular bump ( radius of @xmath65 m ) at the top of the resonator as shown in fig .",
    "the ring resonator in sec .",
    "ii supports a pair of degenerate travelling - wave resonances .",
    "an incident wave in the waveguide from one side couples only to one of these two travelling wave resonances , and as a result the system can be described as a single - mode resonator . in the presence of the bump , the two travelling wave resonances in the ring couple to each other to form two standing wave resonances , with intensity patterns shown in fig . 5a and fig .",
    "we see that one of the standing wave resonances have an intensity node , while the other has an intensity anti - node , at the position of the bump .",
    "both resonances now couple to the waveguide , as can be seen in the transmission spectra for a range of waveguide - resonator separation @xmath15 at fig .",
    "5c . all these spectra exhibit two resonance dips .",
    "since both resonances shift to smaller frequencies as @xmath15 increases , we deduce that @xmath35 for both resonances .",
    "therefore , the resonances in this system have the characteristics of what is required in fig . 4a .",
    "the force spectra for this system , for @xmath66 m , and @xmath67 m , were shown in fig .",
    "5d . we see that around the frequency @xmath68 ( marked with the vertical line ) , the system indeed exhibit a stable optical equilibrium , with the force changes from repulsive to attractive , at a fixed frequency , as @xmath15 increases .",
    "to emphasize this fact , we plot the force as a function of @xmath15 at the frequency @xmath69 in fig .",
    "this clearly shows a stable optical equilbrium at @xmath70 m ; at this frequency , as @xmath15 moves away from @xmath23 , the optical force always points towards @xmath71 .",
    "we also plot the sign of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "5f , which shows that there exists a stable optical equilibrium over the frequency range of @xmath72 to @xmath73 ( shown as the bracket in the figure ) .    in comparing fig .",
    "5c and 5d , we see that in this system , at @xmath69 , at smaller @xmath15 , the repulsive force contribution from the lower - frequency resonance dominates over the attractive force contribution of the higher - frequency resonance . on the other hand , as @xmath15 increases",
    ", the contribution from the lower - frequency resonance decays faster than the higher - frequency resonance . as a result ,",
    "the force changes from repulsive to attractive as @xmath15 increases , creating a stable optical equilibrium . in this case , the fast decay of the contribution of the lower - frequency resonance comes not only from the fact that it has @xmath74 and therefore has a fast - narrowing repulsive peak as indicated in fig .",
    "4a , but also that in this case , the lower - frequency resonance enters under - coupling regime ( where force is small @xcite ) at smaller @xmath15 than the higher - frequency resonance .",
    "this fact can be deduced from the plot of @xmath75 in fig .",
    "5c because in an under - coupling regime , the dip in @xmath75 spectrum becomes shallower as @xmath15 increases .      in this example",
    ", we use a thick ring resonator ( an inner radius of @xmath76 m and an outer radius of @xmath77 m ) .",
    "this resonator can support two families of travelling - wave modes , with the intensity patterns shown in fig .",
    "the first - order modes ( fig .",
    "6a ) have no intensity node inside the ring .",
    "the second - order modes ( fig .",
    "6b ) have an intensity node inside the ring . by studying the force lineshape of each mode (",
    "not plotted ) , we found that the first - order modes have @xmath78 while the second - order modes have @xmath61 .",
    "the positions of these two families of modes in frequency are shown in fig .",
    "6c , where the ratio of the energy inside the ring to input power ( @xmath79 ) , in the unit of @xmath80 , is plotted as a function of frequency at @xmath81 m .",
    "we can see that in the two frequency ranges of @xmath82 to @xmath83 and @xmath84 to @xmath85 , there are two modes , one from each of the two families , that overlap in frequency .",
    "based on the arguments above we will therefore seek to find an optical equilibrium in these ranges .",
    "moreover , the relative positions in frequency of the two modes are different in each range ; in the first range , the second - order mode is at a higher frequency , but in the second range , the first - order mode is at a higher frequency .",
    "therefore , these two ranges of frequency provide an interesting contrast of how different resonances affect the creation of an optical equilibrium .",
    "first , we consider the frequency range of @xmath84 to @xmath85 , where the second - order mode is at lower frequency than the first - order mode as shown in fig .",
    "7a . in this system ,",
    "the @xmath74 resonance has the lineshape that is very asymmetric with a very high repulsive peak ; therefore , the contribution from this repulsive peak near @xmath86 decreases significantly as @xmath15 increases .",
    "this drop in the repulsive force , combining with the contribution from the attractive side in the lineshape of the high - frequency first - order mode , creates a stable optical equilibrium .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "7a where , near @xmath69 , the force changes from repulsive to attractive as @xmath15 increases .",
    "the plot of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "7b also shows a stable optical equilibrium occurring in the frequency range shown by the bracket .",
    "next , we consider the frequency range of @xmath82 to @xmath83 , where the second - order mode is at higher frequency than the first - order mode ( fig . 8) . in this case",
    ", the @xmath74 resonance ( second - order mode ) is at higher frequency .",
    "because the strong repulsive contribution of this resonance does not lie between the two resonances , this system lacks the large swing in the force that is required for the change in the sign of force . as a result",
    ", an optical equilibrium does not occur in this system .",
    "this is shown in fig . 8a and 8b , where no change in the sign of force is observed .",
    "in summary , we studied the optical equilibrium in the lateral optical force in resonator - waveguide system .",
    "we proved analytically and numerically that an optical equilibrium can not occur in a single - resonance system .",
    "we also provide an intuitive picture , supported by numerical simulations , on the conditions for creating optical equilibrium in two - resonance systems .",
    "we believe our work will be useful in the development of self - tuned and robust optical circuits based on optomechanics .",
