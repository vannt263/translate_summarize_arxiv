    "<S> graphene plasmons @xcite ( gps ) are especially interesting due to their ultra - strong confinement , that may lead to a strong enhancement of light - matter interaction@xcite . due to current limitations of the mobility of charge carriers in graphene samples , plasmon propagation lengths are not large compared to the free space wavelength @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they can still be large compared to the graphene plasmon wavelength @xmath3 which can be as small as @xmath4 . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> interesting resonant effects occur in graphene structures of deep subwavelength scales . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , resonant enhancement of absorption due to excitation of gps has recently been proposed@xcite and demonstrated@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , resonant plasmonic effects have been measured in arrays of ribbons in an ample range of ribbons widths@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> often , as evident in these works , the analysis of the resonant absorption peaks has been based on the comparison with the dispersion relation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) gps via the relation @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the `` active '' part of the graphene ribbon ( i.e. the region having a sufficiently high concentration of charge carriers ) . </S>",
    "<S> this simple relation between the modes inside the ribbon and 2d gps corresponds to a fabry - perot cavity with ideally - reflecting walls and is justified by the high value of the gp reflection coefficient at a graphene edge@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an interpretation is however only valid when the phase shift of the gp reflected from the ribbon termination is @xmath0 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show an effect that has been neglected up to now : the influence of the phase picked up by a gp upon reflection at a graphene edge . </S>",

    "<S> the different contributions to the magnetic field are represented in fig 2(a ) , clearly showing that , beyond a transition region at very small distances to the edge , the incident and reflected wave have the same period and virtually the same amplitude , but present a phase shift .    to characterize this phase shift </S>",
    "<S> we define the auxiliary function @xmath15 through the reflected field @xmath16 : @xmath17    defined in this way , @xmath15 is just a re - parametrization of the phase of the reflected field but , at sufficiently long distances from the edge , it converges to the phase pick up by the gp upon the reflection at the edge , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> fig 2(b ) shows the computed @xmath15 for several wavelengths , both for free standing graphene and for graphene on a sio@xmath8 substrate . </S>",
    "<S> two regions are apparent in this figure . </S>",
    "<S> first , at small distances to the edge ( smaller than @xmath19 nm ) , @xmath15 varies spatially , due to the excitation of deeply evanescent modes generated by the termination . </S>",

    "<S> the field is expanded in vacuum ( @xmath23 ) in its eigenstates , thus having the form : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are expansion coefficients , @xmath27 stay for @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively ( the magnetic field for a gp is antisymmetric with respect to the graphene position ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wave vector components are @xmath30 ( with @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , with @xmath35 to satisfy the radiation conditions . </S>",

    "<S> the unknown coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath26 are obtained by imposing continuity of the magnetic fields and the @xmath37-component of the electric field along the plane @xmath13 ( see the supplementary information for the details ) . the final result for the reflection coefficient is @xmath38 where @xmath39 this integral can be computed numerically ( the results can be found in the suppl . mat . ) , but an excellent analytical approximation can be found for the case with large values of @xmath40 ( which is the case of interest , due to strong confinement of the gp ) . noticing that the main contribution to the integral originates from @xmath41 , we can approximate @xmath42 , and obtain @xmath43 , yielding a reflection phase @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this analytical result coincides with the phase extracted from full - wave calculations with @xmath45% error , which is consistent with the neglected contributions from the highly confined modes in the graphene region that lead to the formation of the quasi cylindrical wave close to the edge .    in order to get a better description of experimentally observed samples , </S>",

    "<S> in this case the reflection coefficient corresponds to the reflection from the whole inhomogeneous region , not only from the abrupt termination @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> however , taking into account that gps can follow adiabatically variations in conductivity in length scales even smaller than the gp wavelength@xcite , we can hypothesize that the gp scattering can then be split into 3 `` events '' : ( i ) gp propagating through the inhomogeneity to the edge ; ( ii ) reflection of the gp from the edge with the reflection coefficient @xmath47 ; ( iii ) backward propagation of the reflected gp @xmath36 through the inhomogeneous region . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the full reflection coefficient is simply the product of the reflection coefficient for the edge @xmath47 and phase due to the propagation of the gp along the inhomogeneity region ( see details in suppl . </S>",

    "<S> both @xmath22 ( continuous curves ) and @xmath52 ( `` corrected '' phase , discontinuous curves ) are rendered . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters used for graphene are the same as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    in order to check the validity of this approximation , we have carried out simulations for the two different conductivity profiles , rendered in the inset to fig 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these profiles present a @xmath53-like dependency for @xmath51 ( see details in the suppl . mat . ) since similar behaviour of the fermi level was found in electrostatically doped graphene ribbons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig 3(a ) shows that the argument of the reflection coefficient is very different for both profiles ( rendered by the continuous curves ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when corrected by the optical phase picked up by propagation in the non - uniform region this argument converges to approximately @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> notice that , for the considered ratio between period and ribbon width , the ribbon - ribbon interaction affects mainly the lowest frequency resonance ( @xmath56 ) @xcite and provides a slight red shift ( around a few percent ) of the resonance peak compared to the value predicted by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> calculations show that already for slightly larger inter - ribbon distance ( @xmath71 ) eq .   </S>",
    "<S> provides a virtually exact value for the resonance spectra ( see suppl . mat . ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions.- _ we have shown that when plasmon in graphene is reflected from an abrupt termination , the phase of the reflected plasmon is largely independent on dielectric environment , wavelength and local doping provided that the gp is strongly confined . the reflection phase has a nontrivial value of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we reached our results using three different methods ( finite elements calculation , quasi - analytical model and a fully analytical approximation ) . taking this phase into account </S>",
    "<S> is essential to design and analyze optical properties of graphene resonators ( ribbons , discs , etc . ) . by appropriately remapping of the modes inside a single graphene ribbon </S>",
    "<S> , we have successfully fit the experimentally observed resonances in periodic arrays of graphene ribbons . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be also further extended to other two - dimensional systems supporting plasmons ( like very thin metal films , topological insulators , transition polaritonic layers , etc . ) , where phase of the reflection coefficient is normally , and perhaps incorrectly , assumed to be @xmath0 .    _ </S>",
