    "the analytic hierarchy process ( ahp ) is a method for ranking alternatives in multi - criteria decision making problems .",
    "developed by saaty @xcite , it consists of a three layer hierarchical structure : the overall goal is at the top ; the criteria are in the next level ; and the alternatives are in the bottom level .",
    "the ahp has been used in many different areas including manufacturing systems , finance , politics , education , business and industry ; for more details on the method , see the monographs by saaty - vargas and vaidya - kumar  @xcite .",
    "the essence of the ahp can be described as follows . given @xmath0 alternatives we construct a _ pairwise comparison matrix _ ( _ pc_-matrix ) , @xmath1 for each criterion , in which @xmath2 indicates the strength of alternative @xmath3 relative to alternative @xmath4 for that criterion .",

    "sr_-matrix @xmath8 is constructed , the next step in the ahp is to derive a vector @xmath9 of positive weights , which can be used to rank the alternatives , with @xmath10 quantifying the weight of alternative @xmath3 .",
    "as observed by elsner and van  den  driessche  @xcite , the ideal situation is where @xmath11 , in which case the _ sr_-matrix is _",
    "transitive_. in practice , this will rarely be the case and it is necessary to approximate @xmath8 with a transitive matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath13 for some positive weight vector @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is then how to construct @xmath12 given @xmath8 .",
    "several approaches have been proposed including saaty s suggestion to take @xmath15 to be the perron vector of @xmath8 , or the approach of farkas et al .",
    "@xcite , which chooses @xmath15 to minimise the euclidean error @xmath16 . elsner and van  den",
    "driessche  @xcite suggested selecting @xmath15 to be the max algebraic eigenvector of @xmath8 .",

    "sr_-matrix @xmath8 with a transitive matrix @xmath12 will in general produce different rankings of the alternatives .",

    "this work naturally raises the question of how to treat multiple criteria within the max - algebraic framework .",
    "we address this question here by considering the multi - criteria ahp as a multi - objective optimisation problem , in which we have an objective function of the form ( [ eq : errf ] ) for each criterion ( and associated _",

    "the advantage of this approach is that the weight vector can be interpreted in terms of the maximal relative error functions ( [ eq : errf ] ) associated with the _ sr_-matrices given as data for the problem .",
    "the optimisation problems we consider are the following .",
    "first , we investigate the existence of a single _ transitive _ matrix with a minimum distance to all matrices in the set simultaneously .",
