    ",  @xcite provides a fantastic testing ground for quantum many - body physics .",
    "@xcite meanwhile , the transition has also been observed in one- and two - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "@xcite ultracold atoms in optical lattices are described by the bose - hubbard model ,  @xcite which incorporates two competing trends in an elementary manner : while the repulsive interaction between the atoms tends to localize the particles at individual sites of the lattice potential , tunneling between neighboring sites favors delocalization , and tends to suppress phase fluctuations .",
    "the bose - hubbard model and its descendants have been intensively studied within the last years .",
    "important techniques for monitoring its ground - state properties and the phase diagram include the mean - field approach ,  @xcite strong - coupling expansions ,  @xcite methods using the density matrix renormalization group  ( dmrg ) ,  @xcite and , more recently , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we apply a recently suggested process chain approach  @xcite to the @xmath1-dimensional homogeneous bose - hubbard model , in order to investigate the properties of its ground state in the mott insulator phase for any integer filling factor @xmath2 , as well as the phase diagram for @xmath3 , by means of a high - order expansion in the tunneling parameter . to achieve this ,",
    "we have turned kato s representation of the perturbation series  @xcite into a numerically executable algorithm which handles symbolic diagrams as inputs .",
    "order by order , each observable then is represented by a set of such diagrams , equipped with appropriate weight factors .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the bose - hubbard model is briefly recapitulated .",
    "our zeroth - order hamiltonian contains the local on - site interaction only , while the tunneling term will be treated perturbatively .",
    "section  [ sec : kato ] introduces kato s formulation of the perturbation series , and explains the required elements of the diagrammatic process chain approach .",
    "@xcite as an instructive example for this technique , we outline in some detail how to calculate the fourth - order energy correction induced by the tunneling term .",
    "we also discuss how fully correlated ground - state expectation values are accessible via the perturbational approach . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present results for the ground - state energy , correlation functions , and occupation number fluctuations , as obtained for homogeneous hypercubic lattices with dimensionality @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the required diagrams are developed , and a phenomenological scaling is suggested , which makes the data almost independent of the filling factor  @xmath7 .",
    "results typically are calculated up to tenth order in the tunneling parameter . for @xmath4 and",
    "unit filling we obtain perfect agreement with the results of the high - order symbolic perturbative expansion of damski and zakrzewski .",
    "@xcite we follow their instructive work to some extent in spirit , opening up the regimes of higher  @xmath1 for any  @xmath7 .",
    "the mott insulator - to - superfluid phase transition is then discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] within the framework of the process chain approach .",
    "the phase boundary is determined by invoking the method of the effective potential which provides a convenient indicator for the transition point ;  @xcite this leads to a computational scheme which again can be expressed in terms of diagrams .",
    "@xcite that scheme is worked out exactly in the case of infinite lattice dimensionality  @xmath1 , and then reproduces the well - known mean - field result . for @xmath8 our data , obtained by numerically evaluating the diagrams up to some order  @xmath9 ,",
    "lend themselves to a simple extrapolation procedure for @xmath10 .",
    "critical parameters are computed in this manner for @xmath11 and @xmath12 and any filling factor  @xmath7 ; for @xmath13 , they compare quite favorably to recent high - precision qmc data .  @xcite the last part of this sec .",
    "[ sec : phase ] details how the mean - field prediction is approached with increasing dimensionality of the system .",
    "we close the paper with some concluding remarks and a short outlook in sec  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices are fairly well described by a single - band bose - hubbard model .",
    "_ ultracold _ in this context means that the thermal de broglie wavelength is at least equal to the lattice constant , i.e. , to half the wavelength of the laser radiation generating the lattice .",
    "the assumptions underlying this model , requiring that the thermal and the interaction energies be smaller than the gap between the lowest and the first excited bloch band , are fulfilled if the lattice is sufficiently deep . denoting the interaction energy of a pair of particles occupying the same lattice site by @xmath14 , the chemical potential at site @xmath15 by @xmath16 , and the hopping matrix element connecting well  @xmath15 and well  @xmath17 by @xmath18 , the model takes the form",
    "@xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for site @xmath15 , and @xmath22 is the corresponding number operator",
    ". the chemical potential @xmath16 can incorporate an arbitrary confining potential , and then depends on the lattice site . by choosing appropriate hopping elements @xmath18",
    ", longer - range or anisotropic hopping can be modeled . in this study",
    "we stick to the paradigmatically simple case with site - independent chemical potential @xmath23 and isotropic nearest - neighbor hopping of positive strength  @xmath24 on a hypercubic lattice . utilizing the interaction energy  @xmath14 as the energy scale of reference",
    ", the dimensionless hamiltonian then reads as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is site - diagonal , and @xmath27 describes tunneling between adjacent sites , with @xmath28 indicating that the sum is restricted to nearest neighbors .",
    "one can easily oversee two limiting cases : if the lattice is very deep , tunneling even between neighboring wells is inhibited , because the tunneling parameter  @xmath29 vanishes exponentially with increasing lattice depth .",
    "@xcite the sites then decouple and the hamiltonian becomes local ; one only needs to consider @xmath30 . minimizing the on - site energy @xmath31 of a system with @xmath32 leads to the site - occupancies  @xcite @xmath33",
    "thus , as long as the chemical potential @xmath34 falls between @xmath35 and @xmath7 , each site is occupied by an integer number @xmath36 of atoms , where @xmath37 is the total number of particles , and @xmath38 the number of lattice sites . denoting the vacuum state by @xmath39",
    ", the @xmath30 ground state then is given by the product state @xmath40 for integer @xmath34 the ground state is @xmath41-fold degenerate .",
    "the parameter regime @xmath42 gives rise to insulating phases , because the system remains incompressible for small , but non - zero tunneling strength . a small change of the chemical potential  @xmath23 then does not lead to a change of the occupation number : @xmath43 .",
    "the opposite limiting case appears when the interaction between the particles can be neglected in comparison with the kinetic energy , @xmath44 .",
    "the ground state then becomes an ideal bose - einstein condensate with all particles occupying the zero - quasimomentum state of the lowest band : @xmath45 observe that this is an eigenstate of @xmath46 .",
    "nonetheless , in what follows we use the site - diagonal hamiltonian  @xmath30 and the fock state  ( [ eq : groundstatemi ] ) as the starting point for our perturbative analysis .",
    "for calculating corrections to the ground - state energy , and further ground - state expectation values , we resort to the representation of the perturbation series given by kato .",
    "@xcite its distinct advantage lies in the fact that it yields closed expressions for the perturbative corrections in any order , in contrast to the more familiar recursive formulation of the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series .",
    "@xcite    the ground state @xmath47 of the hamiltonian  @xmath30 is a product of local fock states with @xmath7 particles sitting at each site .",
    "when this system is subjected to some perturbation  @xmath48 , not necessarily given by @xmath46 , the @xmath49th - order correction to its energy is given by the trace  @xcite @xmath50 \\ ; , \\label{eq : kato_energy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all possible sequences @xmath51 of @xmath52 non - negative integers which obey the condition @xmath53 the operators @xmath54 linking the individual perturbation events  @xmath48 are given by @xmath55 with the energies @xmath56 $ ] and @xmath57 $ ] of the unperturbed @xmath30 eigenstates @xmath47 and @xmath58 , respectively . because these fock states form an orthonormal basis , one easily derives @xmath59 to see how eq .",
    "( [ eq : kato_energy ] ) works , let us consider the energy correction in second order , i.e. , for @xmath60 .",
    "the partition problem  ( [ eq : kato_condition ] ) then has the solutions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "accordingly , one finds @xmath64       \\nonumber \\\\      & = & { \\rm tr } \\left[s^0 v s^1 v s^0\\right ]       \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\langle \\mathbf{m}|    v s^1 v |\\mathbf{m } \\rangle       \\nonumber \\\\          & = & \\sum\\limits_{i\\neq \\mathbf{m } }        \\frac{\\langle \\mathbf{m}| v |i \\rangle \\langle i| v |\\mathbf{m } \\rangle }           { e_{\\mathbf{m}}^{(0 ) } - e_i^{(0 ) } } \\ ; . \\label{eq : e_2nd }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the second step , cyclic interchangeability of operators under a trace has been used , together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : s_rel ] ) .",
    "the final expression  ( [ eq : e_2nd ] ) coincides exactly with the familiar textbook result provided by the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , as it should .    due to the restriction  ( [ eq : kato_condition ] ) , in any order",
    "@xmath49 at least two superscripts  @xmath65 are equal to zero , so that the trace  ( [ eq : kato_energy ] ) can always be rewritten as a sum of matrix elements of the standard form @xmath66 .",
    "such elements will be called _",
    "kato terms_. we regard each kato term as a sum over _ process chains _  @xcite leading from @xmath67 back to @xmath67 , with the individual processes corresponding to non - zero matrix elements @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , when calculating energy corrections we identify each process with a term of @xmath46 , setting @xmath69 each kato term now can be viewed as a sum over certain chains of tunneling processes on the lattice .",
    "because these kato terms represent expectation values with respect to the state @xmath67 , each chain has to start and to end in the state @xmath67 .",
    "thus , only closed loops of tunneling processes contribute to the energy correction .",
    "a simple example may illustrate this fact : consider the energy correction in second order , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_2nd ] ) .",
    "one then has two tunneling processes , which could take place anywhere on the lattice . but",
    "only process chains for which initial and final state both coincide with @xmath67 give a contribution .",
    "this requires to tunnel back and forth , thus producing the only closed loop with two individual tunneling processes , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_e_simple ] . such closed loops of tunneling processes will be denoted as _",
    "paths _ in the following .",
    "the respective _ sequence _ of the individual processes , i.e. , their ordering , is quite important for the evaluation of the matrix elements , as will become evident soon .",
    "the particular perturbation  ( [ eq : v_tun ] ) gives no contributions in odd orders , because no closed loops can be formed with an odd number of tunneling processes on a cubic lattice . in fourth order",
    ", the general kato terms are @xmath70 the first term requires that the initial state @xmath67 be recovered after the first process ( numbered from right to left ) , because @xmath71 occurs . with the perturbation  ( [ eq : v_tun ] ) this is impossible .",
    "hence , when treating perturbations that vanish in first order , like the tunneling events  ( [ eq : v_tun ] ) , one can further reduce the number of kato terms . to the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_4th ] ) only chains revisiting @xmath72 after two processes contribute , while evaluating the fourth term requires to take into account all those permutations of the processes forming the closed loop which do not feature the state @xmath67 as an intermediate state . with four tunneling processes one can form lots of closed loops on the lattice , but as the system is homogeneous , paths which are topologically identical contribute in the same way .",
    "we subsume those topologically identical paths under a _",
    "diagram_. examples of topologically identical paths are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : paths_topological_identical ] . according to the linked cluster theorem ,  @xcite disconnected diagrams",
    "do not contribute .",
    "with every diagram we associate a _ weight factor _ which incorporates , on the one hand , the subsummation of topologically identical paths and , on the other , an additional factor of @xmath73 for a diagram visiting @xmath74 lattice sites , as each of these @xmath74  sites can be the `` origin '' of the diagram .    thus , when calculating energy corrections the number  @xmath9 of tunneling processes agrees with the respective order  @xmath49 of the perturbation series , and the overall program for determining these corrections on a hypercubic lattice to a given order  @xmath9 consists of the following steps :    * generate the kato terms provided by the perturbation series  ( [ eq : kato_energy ] ) in @xmath9th order .",
    "this step is independent of the particular problem under study : once the kato terms are known , they can be used for all kinds of perturbative calculations .",
    "group these terms together as far as possible , taking into account that odd orders never contribute , as there are no closed loops with an odd number of tunneling processes .",
    "* create all paths representing a closed loop with @xmath9 tunneling processes .",
    "subsume topologically identical paths to diagrams , and append the correct weight factors .",
    "* for each diagram , go through all permutations of the individual processes ; for each particular sequence thus obtained , determine those kato terms which match it .",
    "compute the corresponding matrix elements , including the respective energy denominators .",
    "sum up the contributions of all sequences and all diagrams .    in high orders",
    "this procedure becomes more and more cumbersome , as the order  @xmath9 enters factorially , and both the number of diagrams and the number of kato terms grows roughly exponentially with  @xmath9 .",
    "table  [ tab : e_dias_kato ] demonstrates this for dimensionalities @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "nonetheless , a considerable advantage offered by this scheme consists in the fact that its implementation on a computer is straightforward , while a representation of the entire hilbert space is not necessary .",
    "the strategy of determining the contributions to the perturbation series from all possible paths on the lattice then allows us to treat filling factors and dimensionalities which are difficult to reach by other approaches . in order to clarify the above steps",
    ", we give an explicit example .",
    ".number of diagrams required by the energy correction for lattice dimensionality  @xmath1 , and number of kato terms , vs.  the order  @xmath9 .",
    "if the perturbation vanishes to first order , one is left with the reduced number of kato terms .",
    "this number is further diminished in case of the energy correction ( last column ) , because an even number of tunneling processes has to appear between two projection operators  @xmath75 .",
    "[ tab : e_dias_kato ] [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the method of the effective potential outlined in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : mfl ] crucially requires that the coefficient of @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effpot ] ) , and hence @xmath76 , be positive . for evaluating @xmath76 within the process chain approach",
    ", we have to construct diagrams containing exactly two annihilation and two creation processes .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath29 ( fourth order of the perturbation series ) , one gets one diagram with two creations and two annihilations at the same site ( @xmath78 ) , leading to @xmath79 permutations . similar to eq .",
