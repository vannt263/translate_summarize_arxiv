    "the possible existence of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase of highly excited hadronic matter is one of the most intriguing questions of high energy physics discussed since almost three decades up to now .",
    "this novel state of matter has been also predicted in lattice qcd calculations ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) and the critical temperature @xmath1 for the ordinary hadronic matter - qgp phase transition has been obtained in the range of 150 - 270 mev depending on the number of active quark flavors ( this corresponds to the broad range of the critical energy densities @xmath2 gev/@xmath3 ) . since estimates of the na50 collaboration for",
    "the energy density obtained in the central rapidity region ( crr ) give the value of 3.5 gev/@xmath3 for the most central pb - pb data point , it has been argued that the conditions for the existence of the qgp are met in pb - pb collisions at cern sps @xcite .",
    "the main argument for the qgp creation during pb - pb collisions at the cern sps was the observation of the anomalous suppression of @xmath0 relative yield .",
    "@xmath0 suppression as a signal for the qgp formation was originally proposed by matsui and satz @xcite .",
    "the idea is based on the modification of the quark forces in plasma due to color screening which would entail a dissociation of @xmath4 bound states , including the prominent @xmath0 at high temperature , observable as a significant depletion of the dilepton spectrum around the quarkonium invariant mass .",
    "the key point of the na50 collaboration paper @xcite was the figure , denoted as fig.6 there , where experimental data for pb - pb collision values of @xmath5 ( the ratio of the @xmath0 to the drell - yan production cross - section times the branching ratio of the @xmath0 into a muon pair ) were presented together with some conventional predictions . here , `` conventional '' meant that @xmath0 suppression was due to @xmath0 absorption in ordinary hadronic matter .",
    "since all those conventional curves saturated at high transverse energy @xmath6 , but the experimental data fell from @xmath7 90 gev much lower and this behavior could be reproduced on the base of @xmath0 disintegration in the qgp @xcite , this was argued to be circumstantial evidence for qgp formation in most central pb - pb collisions . in general , the immediate reservation about such reasoning was that besides those already known ( see e.g. @xcite and references [ 12 - 15 ] in @xcite ) , other possible models formulated in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom could not be ruled out as long as the @xmath0 absorption rates in dense hadronic matter are largely unknown . within a few years",
    "the na50 collaboration has updated their @xmath0 results @xcite , using the nuclear absorption systematics obtained from precise @xmath8 results .",
    "it appeared that also these data could be explained with a hadronic comover absorption model @xcite , without the necessity to invoke qgp formation .",
    "the question , however , arises whether the inputs used in these models are consistent with accessible theoretical or experimental information .    in the present contribution ,",
    "we present a systematic step towards and general description of @xmath0 absorption in the framework of a statistical analysis which can provide a baseline in the search for non - hadronic explanations of anomalous @xmath0 suppression .",
    "the main features of the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite are    1 .",
    "a multi - component non - interacting hadron gas appears in the crr instead of the qgp .",
    "all hadrons from the lowest up to @xmath9 baryon ( with their non - zero masses ) are taken into account as constituents of the matter ; 2 .",
    "the gas expands longitudinally and transversely ; 3 .",
    "@xmath0 suppression is the result of inelastic scattering on constituents of the gas and on nucleons of colliding ions .",
    "both `` traditional '' sources of @xmath0 suppression , namely absorption in the nuclear matter and in the hadron gas in the crr , are considered simultaneously .",
    "the model has the following parameters : the initial time @xmath10 , the @xmath0-baryon cross section @xmath11 , the initial baryon number density @xmath12 , @xmath13 in the expression @xmath14 and the freeze - out temperature @xmath15 .",
    "but the last quantity disappears effectively in the final estimations because the `` natural '' freeze - out is enforced by the transverse expansion when the rarefaction wave reaches the collision axis .",
    "for a given a - b collision @xmath16 is fixed at the moment of the maximal overlap of the nuclei ( for more details see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . as the nuclei pass each other charmonium states",
    "are produced as the result of gluon fusion .",
    "after half of the time the nuclei need to cross each other ( @xmath17 0.5 fm ) , matter appears in the crr .",
    "it is assumed that the matter thermalizes almost immediately and the moment of thermalization , @xmath10 , is estimated to about 1 fm / c @xcite .",
    "then the matter begins its expansion and cooling and after reaching the freeze - out temperature , @xmath15 , it ceases as a thermodynamical system .",
    "the moment when the temperature has decreased to @xmath15 is denoted as @xmath18 .",
    "since the matter under consideration is a gas of hadronic resonances , no phase transition takes place during cooling .    for the description of the evolution of the matter",
    ", relativistic hydrodynamics is employed .",
    "the longitudinal component of the solution of the hydrodynamic equations ( the exact analytic solution for an ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case ) reads ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a local proper time , @xmath21 is the component of the fluid velocity parallel to the collision axis and @xmath22 and @xmath12 are the initial densities of the entropy and the baryon number , respectively . for @xmath23 and the uniform initial temperature distribution with a sharp edge at the border established by the nuclear surfaces ,",
    "the full solution of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamic equations is known @xcite .",
    "the evolution derived is decomposed into the longitudinal expansion inside a slice bordered by the front of the rarefaction wave and the transverse expansion which is superimposed outside the wave . since small but nevertheless non - zero baryon number densities are considered here , the above - mentioned description of the evolution has to be treated as an assumption in the presented model .",
    "the rarefaction wave moves radially inward with the sound velocity @xmath24 ( see sect .  [ soundv ] ) .",
    "for an ideal multicomponent hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium , consisting of @xmath25 species ( here , mesons are considered up to @xmath26 and baryons up to @xmath9 ) , energy density @xmath27 , baryon number density @xmath28 , strangeness density @xmath29 and entropy density @xmath30 are given by ( @xmath31 always )    [ eqstate ] @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mass , baryon number , strangeness , chemical potential , spin and a statistical factor of species @xmath43 , respectively ( an antiparticle is treated as a different species ) .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath44 defines that of the overall baryon number , @xmath45 and that of strangeness , @xmath46 .    to obtain the time dependence of temperature",
    ", baryon number and strangeness chemical potentials one has to solve the equations ( [ barnumb ] ) - ( [ entropy ] ) numerically with @xmath30 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 given as time dependent quantities . for @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "the expressions ( [ bjork ] ) are taken and @xmath49 since the overall strangeness equals zero during the whole evolution , see sect .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "in the hadron gas the sound velocity squared is given by the standard expression    @xmath50    since the experimental data for heavy - ion collisions suggest that the baryon number density is non - zero in the crr at ags and sps energies @xcite , we calculate the above derivative for various values of @xmath28 @xcite .    to estimate initial baryon number density @xmath12 we can use experimental results for s - s @xcite or au - au @xcite collisions . in the first approximation",
    "we can assume that the baryon multiplicity per unit rapidity in the crr is proportional to the number of participating nucleons .",
    "for s - s collisions we have @xmath51 @xcite and 64 participating nucleons .",
    "for central collisions of lead nuclei we can estimate the number of participating nucleons as @xmath52 , so we have @xmath53 .",
    "having taken the initial volume in the crr equal to @xmath54 fm , we arrive at @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "this is some underestimation because for s - s collisions the beam energy was at 200 gev / nucleon , whereas for pb - pb at 158 gev / nucleon . from the au - au data extrapolation",
    "one can estimate @xmath57 @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "these values are for central collisions .",
    "so , we estimate ( [ speeds ] ) for @xmath58 @xmath56 and additionally , to investigate the dependence on @xmath28 much carefully , for @xmath59 @xmath56 . the results of the numerical evaluation of ( [ speeds ] ) are presented in fig.[fig.1 . ] . for comparison , we show also curves for @xmath23 and for a pure massive pion gas . these curves are taken from @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the `` physical region '' we consider between 100 and 200 mev on the temperature axis .",
    "this is because the critical temperature for the possible qgp - hadronic matter transition is of the order of 200 mev @xcite and the freeze - out temperature should not be lower than 100 mev @xcite . at low temperatures we can see a completely different behaviour of the cases with @xmath23 and @xmath60 .",
    "we think that this is caused by the fact that for @xmath60 the gas density can not reach zero when @xmath61 , whereas for @xmath23 it can . for",
    "the higher temperatures all curves excluding the pion case behave qualitatively in the same way . from @xmath62",

    "in sect .  [ hadgas ] we have explained how to obtain the time dependence of the temperature of the longitudinally expanding hadron gas .",
    "this dependence proved to be very well approximated by the expression @xcite    @xmath70    the above approximation is valid in the temperature range @xmath71 $ ] , where @xmath72 mev , @xmath73 and @xmath74 mev .",
    "we started from @xmath75 equal to 227.2 mev ( for @xmath76 @xmath56 ) , 229.3 mev ( for @xmath77 @xmath56 ) and 229.7 mev ( for @xmath78 @xmath56 ) .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath79 gev/@xmath3 ( the initial energy density in the crr has been estimated by na50 @xcite to @xmath80 gev/@xmath3 ) .",
    "then we took several decreasing values of @xmath81 .",
    "for every @xmath75 chosen we repeat the procedure of obtaining the approximation ( [ cooling ] ) , i.e. the coefficient @xmath82 of the power law .",
    "we can formulate the following conclusion : in the `` physical region '' of temperature and for realistic baryon number densities , the longitudinal expansion given by ( [ bjork ] ) results in the cooling of the hadron gas described by ( [ cooling ] ) with @xmath83 , namely :    @xmath84    where @xmath75 belongs to the `` physical region '' .",
    "note that @xmath85 is the exact expression for a baryonfree gas with the sound velocity constant ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath86 in ( [ coolapp ] ) is constant depending only on the initial temperature @xmath75 from which the cooling starts .",
    "the approximation ( [ coolapp ] ) will be used to simplify the evaluation of the @xmath0 survival factors in the next sections .",
    "it should be added that for the excluded volume hadron gas model the above - mentioned conclusion is no longer valid .",
    "we perfprmed the appropriate simulations , but approximations of @xmath87 by a power law turned out to be rather inaccurate and yielded a coefficient @xmath82 which was by a factor two smaller than the squared velocity of sound .",
    "as it has been already mentioned in sect .  [ timetable ] , charmonium states are produced in the beginning of the collision , when nuclei overlap . for simplicity , it is assumed that the production of @xmath88 states takes place at @xmath16 . to describe @xmath0 absorption quantitatively , the idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is generalized here to the case of the multi - component massive gas . since in the crr longitudinal momenta of particles",
    "are much lower than transverse ones ( in the c.m.s .",
    "frame of nuclei ) , the @xmath0 longitudinal momentum is put to zero . additionally , only the plane @xmath89 is under consideration . for the simplicity of the model",
    ", it is assumed that all charmonium states are completely formed and can be absorbed by constituents of the surrounding medium from the moment of their creation by inelastic scattering through interactions of the type @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes a hadron , @xmath92 is a charm meson and @xmath93 stands for a particle which is necessary to conserve the charge , baryon number or strangeness .",
    "since pb - pb collisions are the most relevant case for the problem of qgp search ( see remarks in sect .  [ intro ] ) , the further considerations are done for this case .",
    "it is assumed that the hadron gas , which appears in the space between the nuclei after they have crossed each other , also has the shape of the overlap area of the colliding nuclei ( @xmath94 ) at @xmath10 in the @xmath89 plane .",

    "therefore , one could argue that the na50 pb - pb data do not provide evidence for the production of _ deconfined _ matter in the central rapidity region of a pb - pb collision .",
    "it is an interesting task for forthcoming work to use those energy dependent , non - universal cross sections of the quark exchange model in the calculation of charmonium dissociation in the mchg model .",
    "we expect that the outcome of such a calculation will leave room for the discussion of in - medium modification ( increase ) of dissociation rates by changes in the spectrum ( broadening ) of the final state open charm hadrons which determine ( effectively lower ) the reaction thresholds .",
    "examples have been given for the @xmath161 gas @xcite and for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "a heuristic extension of the mchg to include spectral broadening due to the mott dissociation of hadrons ( mott - hagedorn resonance gas ) has been given in @xcite , but deserves a microscopic foundation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hadronic absorption cross sections of the @xmath0 need to be determined to a higher accuracy before the anomalous @xmath0 suppression could be interpreted as a good signal for qgp formation in central heavy - ion collisions .",
