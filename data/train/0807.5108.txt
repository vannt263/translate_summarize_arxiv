    "circinus x-1 is one of the most exotic x - ray binary systems .",
    "the detection of type i x - ray bursts @xcite and twin khz quasi - periodic oscillations in the x - ray power spectra @xcite strongly suggests that the compact object in the system is a neutron star .",
    "the nature of the companion star is more debatable : some evidence is pointing towards a low - mass object @xcite , while other towards a high - mass one @xcite .",
    "if the companion star is a supergiant , as recent evidence seems to suggest @xcite , then this is at odds with the low magnetic field that must be present in the system ( as inferred from type i x - ray bursts observations , for instance ) .",
    "thus circinus x-1 appears to be a very exotic system , harbouring a young neutron star with a low magnetic field .",
    "neutron star x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are classified according to their x - ray spectral and timing properties as z and atoll sources .",
    "the z class comprises seven objects accreting near the eddington limit .",
    "all of them have been detected in the radio band and show variable emission at cm wavelengths .",
    "the atoll type form the largest class of neutron star xrbs and have x - ray properties similar to black hole xrbs . due to their systematic lower radio fluxes , one order of magnitude less radio loud than z sources , only five of them",
    "have been detected in the radio band .",
    "the behaviour of circinus x-1 is puzzling , exhibiting similarities with z sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , but at times showing characteristics reminiscent of atoll sources @xcite .",
    "the orbit of the binary system probably has a relatively high eccentricity ( e @xmath4 0.4 - 0.9 ) that produces variations in the accretion rate on the compact object @xcite .",
    "this offers an explanation for the periodic flares ( p@xmath416.6 d ) observed in x - ray @xcite , infrared @xcite and radio @xcite , which are interpreted as enhanced accretion near the periastron passage .",
    "circinus x-1 is associated with an arcmin scale synchrotron nebula @xcite which is probably powered by the jet originating close to the binary system @xcite . the jet is observed in radio at arcmin as well as arcsec scales and was recently detected in x - ray band by chandra ( @xcite ; soleri et al . 2008 ) .",
    "observations at cm wavelengths offered evidence for the presence of a relativistic outflow aligned very close to the line of sight @xcite . however , x - ray @xcite and optical @xcite spectroscopy seem to favour a significantly higher angle between the jet axis and the line of sight .",
    "besides the flux modulation at the orbital period , circinus x-1 also exhibits ` secular ' changes , documented in x - ray and radio .",
    "the asm / rxte ( all sky monitor / rossi x - ray timing explorer ) light curve ( 2 - 10 kev ) shows that after a quasi - constant x - ray output , the flux decreased starting from 2000 up to now by one order of magnitude ( fig . 1 , left , bottom panel ) .",
    "the picture is even more dramatic in radio . in the 1970s-1980s",
    "the radio flares reached up to 1 jy ( e.g. @xcite ) , then they were detected at mjy level only @xcite , until recently when a relatively increased radio activity from circinus x-1 was noticed @xcite .",
    "this offered the opportunity to obtain new vlbi ( very large baseline interferometry ) observations of the system within the framework of the first southern e - vlbi ( electronic vlbi ) experiment @xcite , after almost 25 years since the last successful vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "circinus x-1 complex is very close to the supernova remnant snr g321.9 - 0.3 on the plane of the sky .",
    "optical observations @xcite ruled out the possibility that the two objects are physically associated as it was assumed for a long time @xcite .",
    "we have observed the x - ray binary circinus x-1 during a time interval of almost 10 years , between 1996 and 2006 , simultaneously at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . as primary calibrators we used pks j0825 - 5010 ( pks b0823 - 500 ) for epochs 15 and 37 ( see table 1 ) and pks j1939 - 6342 ( pks b1934 - 638 ) for the rest .",
    "pmn j1524 - 5903 ( b1520 - 58 ) was used as secondary calibrator for the entire data set .",
    "its positional uncertainty is , according to the atca calibrator catalog , between 100 and 250 mas . throughout the paper we assumed conservatively the above upper limit as the systematic error in our determinations of positions .",
    "standard calibration techniques were applied using the software miriad @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out at different spatial resolutions , although very similar ( see the array configuration column in table 1 and the atca website ) . to aid an homogeneous analysis , in obtaining the final radio images we have used the same restoring beams ( size and orientation ) for the entire data set at each of the two observed frequencies , for each weighting scheme , natural and uniform .",
    "the size of these beams is in general less than 5 percent different than the sizes of the default synthesized beams .",
    "the exceptions are the observations from epoch 14 when the difference was up to 40 percents ( array configuration 1.5d ) and most of the observations from 1996 july for which the default synthesized beams were very elongated due to the short observational runs . because of this limitation the radio images from the 1996 july epochs 3 - 7 , 9 and 10 are very likely to contain artifacts .",
    "however , we note that the calibration process was successful and the _ uv _ data should not be significantly affected .",
    "the only special case is epoch 10 , for which the phase - referencing calibration was only partially successful , but we are including it in the analysis for completeness .",
    "the flux density within a run varied sometimes by up to 30 percent . in general the variations were smooth over the duration of the observing sessions and tests made by selecting only parts of the data showed that the maps are not affected significantly by this behaviour .",
    "however , when a radio flare happened during an observational run the flux density changed by almost a factor 2 on timescales of hours . in these few cases artifacts could be present in the radio maps ( see section 3 , paragraph 4 ) .    as mentioned in the previous section",
    ", circinus x-1 periodically flares at radio wavelengths .",
    "we used the ephemeris derived from the onset times of 21 well observed such outbursts spanning the past 28 years @xcite to illustrate in fig .",
    "2 the orbital phase coverage of our observations . during the 10 years of data",
    "we have swept the entire orbit of the system , even though more often than not only once for a given orbital phase , and gaps in the coverage are present ."
