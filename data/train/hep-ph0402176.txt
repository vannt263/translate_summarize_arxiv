    "remarkably , the recent kamland @xcite , sno @xcite and k2k @xcite experiments have added so much to the results obtained from earlier solar neutrino , atmospheric neutrino and accelerator experiments @xcite that our knowledge about the neutrino masses and presumed lepton mixing matrix is almost as great as our knowledge of the corresponding quantities in the quark sector . still there is an uncertainty about the interpretation due to the results of the lsnd experiment @xcite . however , this experiment will be checked soon by the miniboone collaboration so one can wait for confirmation before considering whether there is really a problem with the usual picture of three massive neutrinos . in any event , there is a strong presumption that this knowledge will play an important role in going beyond the standard model of electroweak interactions .",
    "one detail is , of course , lacking compared to the quark case . since the neutrino oscillation experiments measure only the differences of the neutrino squared masses , the neutrino masses themselves are not known . according to the latest analysis @xcite the best fit to these differences is : @xmath1    now , there is a simple _ complementary _",
    "ansatz for the 3 x 3 neutrino mass matrix , @xmath2 which , with some assumptions , enables one to obtain the neutrino masses themselves from eq .",
    "( [ massdifferences ] ) ; it requires : @xmath3 it should be remarked that @xmath2 is to be regarded as the prediagonal neutrino mass matrix .",
    "furthermore , in the relation @xmath4 which evidently results if the neutrino mass matrix is taken to be real symmetric , the individual masses may be either positive or negative . the negative masses can be converted to positive ones by adding appropriate factors of @xmath5 in the diagonalizing matrix .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) was motivated in @xcite from the grand unified model , so(10 ) @xcite and in @xcite by noting that it would hold if @xmath2 is the commutator of two other matrices , as may occur in certain models .",
    "if cp violation is neglected there are essentially two possible solutions of the ansatz : either @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same sign and are approximately equal to each other and to @xmath8 or else @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the opposite sign and are approximately equal to each other in magnitude but much larger than the magnitude of @xmath9 .    in the present paper",
    "we will take the point of view that the ansatz , eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , is motivated from so(10 ) . however , the analysis is of course not dependent on the motivation .",
    "the so(10 ) motivation arises from the observation that eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) is , although it seems at first different , essentially the same as the characteristic prediction of grand unification : @xmath10 relating the mass of the b quark with the mass of the the tau lepton ( @xmath11 takes account of the running of masses from the grand unification scale to the low energy hadronic scale of about @xmath12 @xcite ) .",
    "note that in so@xmath13 the neutrino mass matrix takes the form : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively the mass matrices of the light neutrinos , heavy neutrinos and heavy - light mixing ( or  dirac matrix \" ) . to start with",
    ", @xmath2 is an arbitrary symmetric matrix .",
    "if it is real we have cp invariance .",
    "generally the second , seesaw @xcite term is considered to dominate . however , as explained in @xcite , the present model is based on the assumption that the first term dominates . that might not be unreasonable since a rough order of magnitude estimate for the second term would be @xmath18 or about @xmath19 ev . ( the quantity @xmath20 includes a factor @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus the second term could be negligible if neutrino masses are appreciably greater than this value .",
    "in @xcite the complementary ansatz was mainly studied for the case of real @xmath2",
    ". here we will be primarily interested in the more general complex case which allows for non zero cp violation .",
    "furthermore , the input squared mass differences were not taken to be very similar to those in eq.([massdifferences ] ) but were based on a least squares fit @xcite of many different experiments _ including _ lsnd . here",
    "we shall adopt the more conventional values given in eq.([massdifferences ] ) . a related analysis of eq . ( [ ansatz ] )",
    "was recently made in @xcite .    for an understanding of the interesting leptogenesis mechanism @xcite of baryogenesis it is important to also study the properties of the heavy neutrinos which appear there . in the present so(10 )",
    "motivated framework this task turns out to be remarkably simple ; the heavy neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath22 where c is a numerical constant .",
    "this means that the eigenvalues of @xmath16 , to be denoted as @xmath23 are simple multiples of the light neutrino masses @xmath24 .",
    "in addition the unitary matrix , @xmath25 which brings @xmath2 to diagonal form via @xmath26 also diagonalizes @xmath16 .",
    "in other words the heavy neutrinos are clones of the light neutrinos in this picture .",
    "the result follows from the choice of higgs fields in so(10 ) .",
    "trilinear yukawa terms which supply fermion masses can contain higgs fields in the 10 , 120 and 126 dimensional representations . to get the result",
    "just mentioned we need to require that there is only one  126 \" representation present , although any number of  10 \" s and  120 \" s are allowed .",
    "of course we are also assuming the second term in eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) to be negligible for the purpose of generating the light neutrino masses .    in section",
    "ii , we give our conventions for the lepton mixing matrix , including one conventional and two majorana type cp violation phases . an approximate equation relating the complementary ansatz to the parameters of the mixing matrix and the physical light neutrino masses",
    "is written down .",
    "the solutions for the neutrino masses in the cp conserving case , based on the results of neutrino oscillation experiments , are reviewed . in section iii ,",
    "the ansatz equation is solved on the assumption that only the conventional cp phase , @xmath27 is non zero .",
    "it is found that the only solutions correspond to maximal phase , @xmath28 and neutrino masses close to the ones obtained in the cp conserving case . in section",
    "iv we investigate the more complicated but very interesting case when only the two majorana cp violation phases are non zero .",
    "in this case there is a family ( modulo a discrete ambiguity ) of solutions .",
    "we choose the mass of the third light neutrino , @xmath9 as our free parameter and calculate the remaining neutrino masses and the majorana phases as functions of @xmath9 .",
    "the model gives a lower bound for @xmath9 and the cosmology criterion on the sum of neutrino masses effectively yields an upper bound .",
    "the results for the full range are scanned numerically and a simple analytic interpretation of the pattern is presented .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay parameter , @xmath29 is also calculated for each value of @xmath9 . in section v we make a rough estimate of the baryon to photon ratio based on the leptogenesis mechanism . in order to do this",
    "it is necessary to make some statements on the masses and mixings of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "our motivation for the original ansatz suggests a  clone \" model in which the heavy neutrinos have the same mass ratios and mixing matrix as the light ones .",
    "the only new parameter besides @xmath9 is the overall mass scale , which however is constrained by the original motivation to be somewhat on the large side .",
    "then it is relatively easy to calculate the lepton asymmetry parameters , @xmath30 for the heavy neutrino decays as functions of mainly @xmath9 .",
    "we combine these quantities in a semi - quantitative way with criteria from previous treatments of the boltzmann evolution equations for the decaying neutrinos .",
    "it is found that that the most plausible scenarios for leptogenesis involve small cp violating majorana phases and light neutrino masses close to the ones predicted for the cp conserving cases .. finally section vi contains a brief discussion and a brief summary .",
    "here we will obtain an approximate equation which will be useful for relating the complementary ansatz to experimental information on neutrino squared mass differences and mixing angles in the general case where cp violation is allowed .",
    "the notation is the same as in section iii of @xcite which contains more details . for convenience",
    ", we will use what seems to be the most common convention for the part of the leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath31 , which is measured in the usual neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "this part can be constructed as a product of elementary transformations in the ( 12 ) , ( 23 ) and ( 13 ) subspaces .",
    "for example in the ( 12 ) subspace one has : @xmath32 \\label{onetwotransf}\\ ] ] with clear generalization to the ( 23 ) and ( 13 ) transformations",
    ".    then the usual convention corresponds to the choice : @xmath33 with three mixing angles and the cp violation phase @xmath27 .",
    "multiplying out yields : @xmath34 \\label{usualconvention}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 .",
    "since the neutrinos are of majorana type in this model , there are expected also to be physical cp violating effects due to the majorana phases .",
    "these may be introduced via a unimodular diagonal matrix of phases , @xmath36    the full lepton mixing matrix is then expressed as , @xmath37 which has three mixing angles and three independent cp violating phases .",
    "we shall use this form in what follows . as an aside , though",
    ", we remark that the full matrix could also be written @xcite in an unconventional , but more symmetrical , way as : @xmath38    as a final preliminary we need the leptonic w interaction term : @xmath39 where u is defined in eq.([diagonalize ] ) and @xmath40 is a unitary matrix which is needed to diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix . at this point",
    "we shall make the common approximation that @xmath41 can be replaced by essentially the unit matrix .",
    "this is certainly not perfect but it seems reasonable for a start .",
    "then @xmath25 may be replaced by @xmath42 , for which some elements are already well known .",
    "this enables us to present the ansatz in the form : @xmath43 where eqs .",
    "( [ diagonalize ] ) and ( [ fullmixingmatrix ] ) were used . with the parameterized mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( [ usualconvention ] ) the ansatz reads :    @xmath44   + \\nonumber\\\\ m_2e^{2i\\tau_2 } \\left [ 1 -2i(s_{12}s_{13})^2sin{\\delta}e^{-i\\delta } \\right ] \\nonumber + \\\\ m_3e^{2i\\tau_3 } \\left [ 1 + 2i(s_{13})^2sin{\\delta}e^{i\\delta } \\right ] = 0 .",
    "\\label{paramansatz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this equation we can choose the diagonal masses @xmath24 to be real positive",
    ". however it will be a little more convenient in the cp conserving case to allow some of them to be negative as well as positive .",
    "we shall , for definiteness , mainly use the following best fit values @xcite for the mixing angles :    @xmath45    it should be remarked that the precise value of @xmath46 is not well known , in contrast to the other two",
    ".    equation ( [ paramansatz ] ) contains three unknown masses and three unknown cp phases .",
    "it can be written as two real equations and augmented by two equations for two neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "thus there are four equations for six unknowns . by assuming some special simplifications we can make the analysis tractable .    for orientation let us first review the case when the theory is cp conserving so that all the three independent cp phases vanish .",
    "then we will have 3 equations for 3 unknowns .",
    "the ansatz now reads @xmath4 .",
    "define : @xmath47 it can be deduced @xcite from the experimental data that a is positive while the sign of b is not yet known .",
    "their magnitudes are given in eq .",
    "( [ massdifferences ] ) .",
    "thus there are two separate cases to be considered .",
    "first consider both a and b positive .",
    "then solving as in @xcite gives the type i solution :    @xmath48    next consider the type ii solution where b is negative ; it gives :    @xmath49    here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are still almost degenerate but differ in sign .",
    "however @xmath9 is now relatively small compared to the others .",
    "a fully predictive simple case would correspond to keeping @xmath27 as the only cp violation phase .",
    "then the real part of the ansatz equation , ( [ paramansatz ] ) reads    @xmath50    while the imaginary part yields @xmath51 note that the @xmath52 s are being taken real here , although they will be allowed to be either positive or negative .",
    "a negative @xmath52 is not a source of cp violation even though it corresponds to a majorana phase @xmath53 of @xmath54 when the masses are taken positive @xcite .",
    "now eqs.([aandb ] ) , ( [ realpart ] ) and ( [ imagpart ] ) constitute 4 equations for the three @xmath52 s and @xmath27 .",
    "however it turns out that , except for the special case when @xmath55 , there is no consistent solution of this set of four equations for four unknowns . to see this , first consider solving simultaneously the three equations ( [ aandb ] ) and ( [ imagpart ] ) when the special case does not hold . the numerical solution is seen to require @xmath56 and is found to be ( with @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 we must now check to see if this is consistent with the remaining eq .",
    "( [ realpart ] ) .",
    "that leads to the requirement : @xmath59 which , given the numerical value of @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ exptmixingangles ] ) clearly leads to the contradiction @xmath61 .",
    "this contradiction will persist even if the upper bound ( about 0.044 ) rather than the best fit for @xmath60 is used .",
    "the result is also not changed if the signs of all the @xmath52 s are reversed .",
    "thus the only possibility for pure @xmath27 type cp violation in the present scheme is the special case where @xmath62",
    ". then we must solve simultaneously the three equations consisting of eq .",
    "( [ realpart ] ) in which this substitution has been made for @xmath63 as well as eqs .",
    "( [ aandb ] ) .",
    "this results in the equation for , say @xmath7 , @xmath64 where @xmath65 has been arbitrarily taken positive .",
    "knowing @xmath7 , the other two masses may of course be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ aandb ] ) .",
    "taking , for definiteness , the mixing angle from eq .",
    "( [ exptmixingangles ] ) , one finds essentially two different solutions .",
    "these are quite similar to the type i and type ii solutions given above in the cp conserving case .",
    "the type i solution , with @xmath66 is @xmath67 the type ii solution , with @xmath56 , reads @xmath68 the very close similarity between the cp conserving solutions and the solutions with @xmath62 is understandable due to the small value of @xmath60 .",
    "since , as we have just seen , there is only one particular allowed value for the conventional cp phase , @xmath27 if it is considered as the only source of cp violation in the present scheme , it is of great interest to investigate the majorana phases . clearly , it seems sensible to study these phases with the simplification of putting @xmath27 to zero . from eqs .",
    "( [ onetwotransf ] ) and ( [ threeomegas ] ) it is seen that the same effect is accomplished by setting @xmath69 .",
    "then the ansatz equation ( [ paramansatz ] ) takes the form @xmath70 for our present case it is convenient to take all three @xmath52 s to be real and positive ( note that a phase angle @xmath71 corresponds to what was taken as a shorthand to be a negative value of @xmath52 ) .",
    "together , eq . ( [ majtypeviol ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ aandb ] ) comprise four real equations for five unknowns ( three masses and two independent @xmath53 s ) .",
    "to proceed we shall thus assume a value for @xmath9 so that we have four equations for four unknowns .",
    "in addition there is the two fold ambiguity due to the unknown sign of b. finally we shall allow @xmath9 to vary to obtain a global picture of the situation .    now , once we have assumed a value for @xmath9 , we can immediately find @xmath6 and @xmath7 from eqs .",
    "( [ aandb ] ) . furthermore , eq . ( [ majtypeviol ] ) can be pictured in the complex plane as a triangle formed from vectors with lengths @xmath52 , having angles @xmath72 as measured from the positive horizontal axis .",
    "then let @xmath73 be the interior angle opposite side @xmath52 as illustrated by the choice of triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the problem reduces to one from elementary plane geometry .",
    "given the three sides ( @xmath52 ) , of a triangle , find the three interior angles ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we may start for example , by using the law of cosines to get @xmath74 and continue similarly to get the others . finally the parameters @xmath53 which appear in the actual parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ majoranaphases ] ) are found from fig .",
    "1 as @xmath75 in particular , the quantities @xmath76&=&-sin(\\mu_1+\\mu_2 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ sin[2(\\tau_1-\\tau_3)]&=&sin\\mu_2 , \\nonumber\\\\ sin[2(\\tau_2-\\tau_3)]&=&-sin\\mu_1 , \\label{usefulsines}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] will turn out to be of interest .",
    "actually , given the three interior angles @xmath73 of a triangle we do not get a unique choice of phase differences @xmath77 .",
    "while a rotation in the plane of the triangle will not change these phase differences , it is straightforward to see that the reflection of the triangle about any line in the plane will reverse the signs of all the phase differences .",
    "thus there is another solution in which an extra minus sign appears on each right hand side of ( [ usefulsines ] ) .",
    "now let us discuss the solutions of the complementary ansatz equation for various assumed values of @xmath9 . in table",
    "[ trianglesampler ] the three real positive masses as well as the corresponding values of the two independent internal angles @xmath78 of the triangle are listed .",
    "of course , @xmath79 .",
    "the solution with @xmath66 ( type i with @xmath80 ) will be listed when it exists as well as the type ii solution ( @xmath56 or @xmath81 ) .",
    "let us start with large values of @xmath9 and go down . just from the ansatz",
    "there is no upper bound on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "however there is a recent cosmology bound @xcite which requires , @xmath82 thus values of @xmath9 greater than about 0.3 ev are physically disfavored .",
    "table [ trianglesampler ] shows that at this value both type i and type ii solutions exist and correspond to almost equilateral triangles .",
    "this is true also for higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "notice that since the triangles are close to being equilateral , they have large interior angles and hence ( see for example eq .",
    "( [ usefulsines ] ) ) large cp phases .",
    "the picture remains very similar down to around @xmath83 but as one gets closer to the value , roughly @xmath84 , where the real type i solution of eq .",
    "( [ typeone ] ) exists , there is a marked change .",
    "it is seen that the interior angles of the type i solution become small as it prepares to go to the degenerate triangle corresponding to the real solution .",
    "we may get as small cp phases as we like by tuning close to the real solution ; this is illustrated in table [ trianglesampler ] for a particular value of @xmath9 .",
    "if one further lowers @xmath9 , it is found that the type i solution no longer exists . on the other hand",
    "the type ii solution persists and does not change much until @xmath9 approaches the small value of roughly 0.00068 ev . there are no solutions for @xmath9 smaller than this value .",
    "we can also tune @xmath9 as illustrated in the table to get as small cp phases as we like for the type ii case .",
    "it should be remarked that the precise numbers in table [ trianglesampler ] are based on the assumption that the best fit numbers given in eq .",
    "( [ massdifferences ] ) are exact and hence are meaningful to the accuracy given only in the sense of comparing the various solutions with each other , not with experiment .",
    ".panorama of solutions as @xmath9 is lowered from about the highest value which is experimentally reasonable to the lowest value imposed by the model . in the type i solutions @xmath9 is the largest mass while in the type ii solutions @xmath9 is the smallest mass .",
    "for each value of @xmath9 , the values of the model predictions for @xmath6 and @xmath7 as well as the internal angles @xmath85 and @xmath86 are given .",
    "the model prediction for the neutrinoless double beta decay quantity @xmath29 is next shown .",
    "finally , the last column shows the estimated lepton asymmetries due to the decays of the heavy neutrinos .",
    "note that the reversed sign of lepton asymmetry is also possible , as discussed in the text . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is straightforward to give an analytic interpretation of the pattern of solutions just observed .",
    "first note that cp violation corresponds to a non degenerate triangle .",
    "note also that the orientation of the triangle in the complex plane is just obtained by imposing the unimodularity condition for @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ majoranaphases ] ) .",
    "hence the internal angles , @xmath73 are really the intrinsic carriers of cp violation .",
    "the determinant of whether one has cp violation is the non vanishing of the quantity : @xmath88^{1/2 } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "m&=&\\frac{1}{2 } ( m_1+m_2+m_3 ) , \\label{arealaw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which just expresses the area , @xmath89 of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides .",
    "this area may be rewritten in the convenient form : @xmath90[m_3 ^ 2-(m_1-m_2)^2 ] \\right)^{1/2}. \\label{secondarea}\\ ] ] now we may see that the vanishing of the first factor corresponds to the type i real solution while the vanishing of the second factor corresponds to the type ii real solution .",
    "furthermore , for a solution to exist , the argument of the square root should be positive . with the second factor , that establishes the minimum allowed value of @xmath9 while with the first factor , that establishes the minimum value of @xmath9 which allows a type i solution .",
    "an important test of the model is the experimental bound on neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "this implies @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 using the parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ usualconvention ] ) and approximating @xmath93 ( which is reasonable in the present model since @xmath9 is never much larger than @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) , this can be written simply as : @xmath94^{1/2}. \\label{ndbd3}\\ ] ] here eqs .",
    "( [ thethreetaus ] ) were also used .",
    "reading @xmath95 from ( [ exptmixingangles ] ) then enables us to calculate @xmath29 for each line of table i. it is seen that @xmath29 decreases smoothly with decreasing @xmath9 for each of the type i and type ii solutions .",
    "all the values of @xmath9 listed are consistent with the present bound .",
    "it is interesting that an improvement of the experimental bound by an order of magnitude @xcite would provide a good test of the model .",
    "when one adopts the so(10 ) motivation for the present ansatz , it turns out that the resulting model predicts in a simple way the properties of the heavy neutrinos which are intrinsically contained in the so(10 ) theory . this feature may be used in connection with the leptogenesis mechanism @xcite of baryogenesis . according to this mechanism , the cp violating and lepton number violating decays of the heavy neutrinos at a high temperature ( corresponding to the grand unification scale ) in the very early universe",
    "establish a lepton asymmetry .",
    "as the universe cools further , the ( b+l ) violating but ( b - l ) conserving `` sphaleron '' interaction @xcite converts this into a baryon asymmetry which may be compared with the observed ratio of baryons to photons in the universe .",
    "there are many interesting discussions of this mechanism in the literature @xcite . here",
    ", we will estimate the dependence on neutrino masses and cp phases of the predicted baryon asymmetry in the present model .",
    "the starting point of this discussion is the yukawa term of the lagrangian density which describes the tree level decay of a heavy majorana neutrino , @xmath96 ( where the subscript denotes a 3-valued generation index ) to a higgs doublet member , @xmath97 plus the appropriate member of the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath98 then the yukawa term reads : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the matrix of yukawa coupling constants .",
    "we can simplify this expression , which is supposed to contain the fermion fields in prediagonal bases , in several ways .",

    "as mentioned in section i , if the so(10 ) model contains only a single `` 126 '' higgs type field ( although any number of  10 \" s and  120 \" s are allowed ) and also if the first ( non see - saw ) term in eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) is dominant , the prediagonal mass matrices for the light and heavy neutrinos must be proportional to each other and the diagonalizing matrix @xmath25 must be the same one which appears in eq .",

    "an experimental measurement of non - zero @xmath46 would , practically speaking , rule out this case as a candidate for leptogenesis .",
    "in this paper , we investigated an ansatz which correlates information about the four quantities in the light neutrino sector which are not yet known from experiment ; namely , the absolute mass of any particular neutrino , the  conventional \" cp violation phase and the two majorana phases . of course , with input from analyses of neutrino oscillation experiments , the masses of the other two neutrinos can be found , up to a discrete ambiguity , if the mass of one is specified .",
    "the results of the present paper can be used for calculating many quantities of experimental interest like the neutrinoless double beta decay amplitude factor @xmath183 ( presented in section iv ) and various lepton number violating decays .",
    "the ansatz is not completely predictive , unless some assumptions are made .",
    "we first reviewed the case of assumed cp conservation ( where just the three neutrino masses are obtained).then we showed that if only the  conventional \" cp violation phase is assumed to be non - zero , its value is fixed by the ansatz to be maximal .",
    "a possibly more interesting case appears if we assume that only the two majorana phases are non - zero .",
    "this enables us to scan the limited allowed range of assumed neutrino mass , @xmath9 ( say ) and find the other two neutrino masses as well as the two majorana phases for each value of @xmath9 .",
    "the result seems to cut through a  cross section \" of interesting possibilities which are described in a simple way .",
    "the still more complicated case without setting any of the three cp phases to zero gives a two parameter family of solutions and will be treated elsewhere .",
    "another ( common ) assumption we made for a first analysis is that the measured lepton mixing matrix is dominated by the neutrino factor .",
    "this is consistent with the finding in recent years that the mixing in the neutrino sector is apparently much larger than the mixing in the quark sector ( which in models is usually relatively small and similar to that of the charged lepton factor ) .",
    "it seems relevant to discuss briefly the status of the motivations for the complementary ansatz we are using .",
    "one motivation , based on a loop mechanism for generating neutrino masses was discussed recently by he and zee @xcite .",
    "our motivation @xcite was based on the grand unification group so(10 ) .",
    "this group is well known to have the elegant feature that it accomodates one generation of elementary fermions as well as an extra ( now desired ) neutrino field in its fundamental spinor irreducible representation .",
    "naturally , there are many possibilities for doing a detailed calculation using this group",
    ". one may ask whether it should be regarded as being derived from a superstring theory , whether it should be supersymmetric , whether the symmetry breakdown should be dynamical , whether the symmetry breakdown should be induced by higgs fields and if so what kind and how many , etc ?",
    "we focus , in our motivation , on the conventional possibility of using higgs fields since it seems almost kinematical now ( although since no higgs field has yet been seen one should keep an open mind ) .",
    "of course , there have been many interesting treatments along these lines @xcite .",
    "our ansatz is suggested by a relation involving only the neutrino mass matrix which might be true ( or at least approximately correct ) in a large number of models . in so(10 ) , tree level masses from a renormalizable lagrangian can be obtained by using any number of higgs mesons belonging to the 10 , 120 and 126 dimensional representations . however , examining the form of the predicted mass matrices shows that the following fairly general relation @xcite holds : @xmath184 for any number of 10 s and 120 s but only a single 126 present . here",
    "@xmath185 and @xmath186 are respectively the prediagonal mass matrices of the charge -1/3 quarks and charge -1 leptons while @xmath187 , as previously mentioned .",
    "@xmath15 , which arises from the 126 higgs field yukawa couplings , is the non seesaw part of the light neutrino mass matrix which appears in eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) .",
    "taking traces cancels the contributions ( antisymmetric matrices ) of any 120 higgs multiplets to the left hand side .",
    "then , assuming the transformations which bring @xmath185 and @xmath186 to diagonal form to be roughly close to the identity we observe that the left hand side is approximately equal to @xmath188 , which is about zero .",
    "in fact this is a characteristic prediction of grand unification . in turn the right hand side",
    "gives us the starting ansatz when it is assumed that the non seesaw term dominates in eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) . of course",
    ", if this domination is to hold the masses of the heavy neutrinos should not be too low .",
    "the present paper is in effect exploring the range of possibilities which exist when these assumptions are made in so(10 ) models .",
    "an interesting question is whether this kind of limit or the pure seesaw limit gives a better description of nature , even if both terms are actually required .",
    "we remark that so(10 ) also gives another similar relation , @xmath189 when only one 126 higgs field exists . here",
    "@xmath190 and @xmath17 respectively denote the prediagonal charge 2/3 quark mass matrix and the prediagonal neutrino  dirac \" matrix connecting the heavy and light neutrino fields .",
    "an intriguing way to learn more about cp violation in the lepton sector is the study of the leptogenesis mechanism of baryogenesis .",
    "we saw that the treatment of this process simplifies when one adopts the present so(10 ) motivation .",
    "then the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath2 and @xmath15 are approximately equal and proportional ( due to the assumption of only one 126 field in the theory ) to the heavy neutrino mass matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the only free parameter for the heavy neutrinos is their overall mass scale and this should not be too small to preserve non seesaw dominance .",
    "we showed in section v that it is easy to estimate the lepton asymmetry parameters @xmath30 for a  panorama \" of values of the independent variable @xmath9 since they are actually independent of the overall heavy neutrino mass scale .",
    "as far as the resulting baryon to photon ratio , @xmath152 ( parameterized in eq .",
    "( [ etaformula ] ) ) is concerned , the typical values of the @xmath30 give @xmath152 much greater than the experimental one for suppression factors @xmath160 of order unity .",
    "we observed that if the suppression factors are not too small one can therefore always choose a value of @xmath9 close enough to one of the two essentially different cp conserving solutions so that the majorana phases are small enough to get experimental agreement for @xmath152 . using estimates of the suppression factors taken from other earlier studies , we noted that this conclusion seems reasonable .",
    "of course the study of the suppression factors by solving the boltzmann evolution equations is an important topic which involves many subtleties and would repay further work in the present model .",
    "finally , the posible indication of very small cp phases might suggest a model in which the cp violation in the lepton sector has a separate identifiable source .",

    "<S> if cp violation is neglected this enables one to use the existing data on squared mass differences to estimate ( up to a discrete ambiguity ) the neutrino masses themselves . if it is assumed that only the conventional cp phase is present , the ansatz enables us to estimate this phase in addition to all three masses . </S>",
    "<S> if it is assumed that only the two majorana cp phases are present , the ansatz enables us to present a one parameter family of solutions for the masses and phases . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to obtain a simple  global \" view of lepton number violation effects . furthermore using an so(10 ) motivation for the ansatz suggests an amusing toy ( clone ) model in which the heavy neutrinos have the same mixing pattern and mass ratios as the light ones . in this case only their overall mass scale is not known ( although it is constrained by the initial motivation ) . using this toy model we make a rough estimate of the magnitude of the baryon to photon ratio induced by the leptogenesis mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> solutions close to the cp conserving cases seem to be favored . </S>"
