    "wave turbulence is expected to occur in the ir regime .",
    "recent developments presented in refs .",
    "@xcite allow one to set up a unifying description of scaling , both in the ultraviolet ( uv ) regime , where the wave - kinetic and quantum boltzmann equations apply , and in the ir limit .",

    "new scaling laws were found by analysing non - perturbative kadanoff - baym dynamic equations , as in the uv , with respect to nonthermal stationary power - law solutions  @xcite .",
    "these solutions were termed nonthermal fixed points .",
    "analogous predictions for dilute bose gases were given in @xcite , proposing what was termed strong matter - wave turbulence in the regime of long - range excitations .",
    "in @xcite , it was then shown that these nonthermal fixed points can also be understood , in two and three dimensions , in terms of vortex excitations of the superfluid : in the infrared limit of large wave numbers the incompressible , superfluid component of the gas dominates , and the predicted ir power laws appear due to the algebraic radial decay of the flow - velocity around the vortex cores . as a consequence , within a window in momentum space , which is limited by the inverse mean distance between different vortices and the inverse core size , the single - particle occupation number spectrum shows the power law predicted in @xcite .",
    "before we discuss this in more detail let us first turn back to the soliton spectra derived in the previous section .",
    "assuming an equal number of solitons traveling with positive and negative velocities , @xmath99 , i.e. , assuming @xmath100 , the single - particle spectrum ( [ eq : spectrumthingreysolitongasranddir ] ) is characterised by a maximum of two scales .",
    "consider the case @xmath101 .",
    "for momenta greater than the reduced soliton density but smaller than the reduced inverse healing length , @xmath92 , with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , the momentum distribution exhibits a power - law behaviour , @xmath31 .",
    "this reflects , first , the random position of the kink - like phase jump across the center of the soliton , and second , that these momenta can not resolve the spatial width of the kink . in other words , looking within a spatial window of size between @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the appearance of a single sharp solitonic phase jump inside the window",
    "is observed in a random manner .",
    "hence , for any of these window sizes , the system looks identical , it appears self - similar .",
    "this self - similarity is at the base of the scaling momentum distribution .",
    "already for a single soliton , the momentum distribution does not know anything about the position of the kink ( this information appears as a phase in the momentum - space bose field which is irrelevant for @xmath86 ) , and thus the single - soliton distribution is self - similar , too .    for black solitons ,",
    "the self - similar scaling region is limited by the scales @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "below @xmath106 , the distribution is constant because too low wave numbers can not resolve the kink - structure .",
    "this corresponds to the first - order coherence function decaying exponentially in space , with the decay scale set by the soliton distance @xmath108 , @xmath109 above @xmath107 , the momentum spectrum resolves the finite width of the soliton density dip which results in an exponential suppression of the mode occupations .",
    "we recall that also in equilibrium , at sufficiently high temperatures where quasiparticle mode occupations are large , @xmath110 , the first - order coherence function decays exponentially , @xmath111 $ ] , where the scale is set by the coherence length @xmath112 .",
    "hence , the corresponding momentum spectrum has the same shape @xmath113 as for a set of random thin solitons .",
    "we emphasise , however , that the transition scale @xmath106 above which scaling @xmath114 sets in ( see , e.g.  ( [ eq : spectrumthinblacksolitongas ] ) ) can be made larger than for a thermal ensemble by increasing the soliton density @xmath49 above the inverse thermal coherence length @xmath115 .",
    "this allows to identify non - equilibrium soliton vs.  thermal scaling in experiment .",
    "we finally compare the universal and non - universal aspects of the soliton momentum spectra found here with the corresponding spectra in @xmath116 and @xmath117 dimensions . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , the universal exponent @xmath118 , @xmath119 , found for the particle spectra @xmath120 during the dynamical relaxation of an initially strongly quenched gas reflected the appearance of vortices in two and vortex lines in three dimensions . in two dimensions ,",
    "this can be seen in an easy way looking at the flow velocity field @xmath121 at the distance @xmath122 from the core of a singly quantised vortex , where @xmath123 is the local tangential unit vector and @xmath11 the phase angle of the complex bose field .",
    "the @xmath122-dependence implies a @xmath124 scaling of @xmath125 and thus a @xmath126 scaling of the kinetic energy @xmath127 , i.e. , @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "similar arguments lead to @xmath129 for the radial momentum distribution in the presence of a vortex line in three dimensions @xcite . extending these arguments , the scaling @xmath130 was shown to appear for ensembles of randomly positioned vortices / vortex lines in a range of momenta @xmath131 between the inverse of the inter - vortex distance @xmath132 and the inverse of the healing length @xmath133 which is a measure for the core width .    as pointed out above , the power - law spectrum @xmath130 , in turn , had been predicted by use of nonperturbative field - theory methods in @xcite where it resulted for a strong - wave - turbulence cascade in the ir , characterising the scaling behaviour at a nonthermal fixed point .",
    "this cascade was shown in @xcite to be caused by particles being transported towards the ir where they build up high mode occupations and thus coherence in the sample , see also @xcite .",
    "note that in the picture of the evolving bose field this momentum - space transport corresponds to the mutual annihilation of vortices and anti - vortices in the system which results in an increase of the inter - vortex distance and thus of the range over which phase coherence is established .",
    "having recalled all this , we note that there is a discrepancy between the predicted scaling @xmath134 , which was found consistent with the vortex picture for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and the scaling @xmath114 obtained here for the solitons in @xmath135 . to gain more insight into this issue we consider the spatial decay of the phase coherence for a system in two dimensions over distances considerably larger than the intervortex spacing . in analogy to the soliton ensembles discussed in sect",
    "[ sec : rsm ] , we consider randomly positioned and well - separated vortices .",
    "one finds that the decay of the phase coherence follows the same exponential law , @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the one - dimensional uniform vortex density along the straight line through @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "fourier transforming ( [ eq : phasecohdecay ] ) with respect to @xmath140 results in a momentum spectrum @xmath141 which scales as @xmath142 for momenta considerably larger than the inverse vortex distance @xmath143 .",
    "analogously , one finds @xmath144 for vortex line tangles in three dimensions .",
    "we use the subscript ` c ' to distinguish these spectra from the @xmath86 discussed above .",
    "the apparent contradiction between the respective scalings of @xmath86 and @xmath145 whose exponents differ by @xmath26 , is resolved by observing the following : while the exponential decay ( [ eq : phasecohdecay ] ) is valid over large distances @xmath146 , it is the algebraic dependence of the flow field @xmath147 as a function of distance from the vortex core which matters on length scales below the inter - vortex distance , causing the steeper power law @xmath130 at momenta @xmath148 .",
    "hence , we find an important qualitative difference between the physical properties underlying the universal scaling @xmath31 in one dimension and the scalings @xmath130 in @xmath116 and @xmath117 dimensions : while black solitons in one dimensions are at rest and no particle flow can occur , in higher dimensions , transverse flow circling around the vortex cores gives rise to an additional contribution to the kinetic energy .",
    "as far as this transverse flow dominates over a possible additional longitudinal flow component for which @xmath149 , see @xcite , this comparison also holds when allowing for grey solitons , which are moving opposite to the ( longitudinal ) particle flow across the soliton dip .    in summary , there is a principal difference between the scalings of the momentum spectra in one- and in higher dimensions , giving rise to a deviation of the scaling @xmath114 in @xmath135 from the field - theory prediction @xmath150 which , in turn , is valid in @xmath116 and @xmath117 dimensions . to recover this discrepancy within a field - theory approach to strong wave turbulence",
    "is beyond the scope of this article .      in our dynamical simulations we will consider soliton formation in a harmonic trapping potential rather than in a homogeneous system ,",
    "see sect .",
