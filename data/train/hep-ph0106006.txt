    "consider a dispersion relation ( dr ) for a ( generic ) normalized nucleon form factor ( ff ) @xmath5 with a subtraction at @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xmath8 for @xmath9 ( the lowest mesonic threshold , @xmath10 for even and @xmath11 for odd g parity @xmath12 channels ) , the phase @xmath13 of the ff defined as @xmath14 is given by the principal value integral @xmath15 so in principle the method is very simple : ( i ) use space - like data on the left side of eq.(1 ) and solve the integral equation to find @xmath16 for @xmath9 .",
    "( ii ) having determined the modulus @xmath16 , use eq.(2 ) to compute the phase @xmath13 .",
    "the above procedure has been unsuccessful in the past as it is an `` ill - posed '' mathematical problem@xcite .",
    "the result depends on the input data in an unstable way and an impossible accuracy is needed before one arrives to a stable unique solution .",
    "figure 1 : pion space - like ff computed via dr without ( grid band ) and with ( light band ) subtraction , compared with pion ff space - like data and square route of proton space - like ff data fit ( dark band ) .",
    "figure 2 : pion ff computed via dr from time - like data .",
    "figure 3 : phases of proton ( light band ) and pion ( dark band ) ff computed via dr .",
    "figure 4 : phase of pion ff ( dark band ) compared with the half of nucleon isovector ff ( light band ) .",
    "figure 5 : proton magnetic ff computed via dr .",
    "figure 6 : neutron magnetic ff computed via dr .",
    "figure 7 : imaginary part of the nucleon magnetic isovector ff computed via dr compared with expectation from unitarity relation .",
    "figure 8 : imaginary part of the nucleon isoscalar ff computed via dr .",
    "a successful method@xcite has been developed by splitting the time - like region into 2 parts :    \\(i ) : is the unknown unphysical region @xmath17 $ ] for which the ff is to be determined .",
    "\\(ii ) : consists of the physically accessible time - like region @xmath18 , for which data exist and quite accurate asymptotic estimates are available .    with the above breakup ,",
    "the unknown part of the integral equation is reduced to the ( small ) region i , which is amenable to a finite matrix analysis with some technical refinements described below in brief ( the details of the developed procedure may be found in references @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "an integral equation of the first kind , linear in the unknown @xmath19 , can be derived @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a `` known '' quantity since it can be calculated directly from experimental data in the time - like region with some recipe to extrapolate them to very high @xmath22 values .    to avoid instabilities usually met in solving first kind integrals such as eq.(3 ) , we impose a regularization scheme with smoothness :    @xmath23   @xmath24 is calculated using time - like data through a rational , smooth function with the expected asymptotic behavior .",
    "the subtraction at @xmath25 helps in diminishing the impact which the asymptotic behavior has on the results .",
    "@xmath23   there is a steep spike near the @xmath12 threshold . to avoid any ensuing instabilities ,",
    "the upper limit of the unphysical region has been raised to @xmath26 where @xmath27 and continuity is imposed there .",
    "a new dr is constructed for the region ( @xmath28)@xcite .",
    "+ @xmath23 our regularization consists in requiring the local curvature of the ff in the unphysical region , @xmath29 to be limited . instead of the second derivative of @xmath19 , as is standard@xcite , we employ the second derivative of @xmath30 for this purpose .",
    "the reason is that fluctuations in @xmath30 are important only when @xmath30 is large , while @xmath19 fluctuations would be large also when @xmath30 is small .",
    "+ @xmath23 eq.(3 ) is then linearized by transforming the integrals into sums over @xmath31 suitable sub intervals in @xmath32 , with their widths increasing with @xmath32 .",
    "this introduces further smoothness , by effectively integrating over any structure with a narrower half width .",
    "@xmath23  the minimize the integral @xmath33 @xmath34 ^ 2 , \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] where @xmath35|$ ] is calculated in the middle of the @xmath36 th sub interval .",
    "@xmath37 , with @xmath38 , correspond to the experimental points available in he space - like region .",
    "@xmath23  finally , we have @xmath39 the `` dumping parameter '' @xmath40 has to be chosen by trial and error : if it is set too large , it will not respond to sharp structures , while unstable solutions will result if it is set too low .",
    "@xmath23  the uncertainties in the solution of eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , due to experimental errors , were estimated by simulating new space- and time - like data according to the quoted errors and then solving the dr for each simulated set .",
    "to test the entire procedure and also to get a suitable range for the parameter @xmath40 , we computed the space - like pion ff using time - like data . in the time - like region , this ff is known up to the @xmath41 mass and at higher @xmath42 , it was extrapolated using first order qcd@xcite . in fig.(1 ) , comparison is made with the measured ( low @xmath42 ) space - like data .",
    "( higher space like @xmath42 data points are through extrapolations from pion electroproduction data and thus may have systematic errors ) .",
    "we have also made other tests[3,4 ] obtaining good agreement with the @xmath43 peak , the @xmath43 width and also a dip at @xmath44 for @xmath45 fig.(2 ) .",
    "the phase of the pion ff approaches just above @xmath46 to its expected asymptotic value of @xmath47 degrees fig.(3,4 ) .",
    "below we summarize some salient features of our findings :    @xmath23  for the first time , resonant structures have been generated from `` smooth '' inputs fig.(5,6,7,8 ) .",
    "the method is stable and reliable .",
    "@xmath23  the combined ( @xmath48 ) peaks and the @xmath1 are generated at the right mass .",
    "however , the @xmath43 peak is much broader .",
    "earlier analyses@xcite had also found a similar discrepancy .",
    "@xmath23  no @xmath3 signal is visible thus signaling a very small @xmath49 content in the nucleon .",
    "@xmath23  phases for the nucleon are consistent with expectations : @xmath50 within the error bands fig.(3 ) .",
    "@xmath23  there is an interference pattern near threshold ( @xmath51 ) which may be related to baryonium fig.(5,6 ) .",
    "@xmath23  @xmath52 changes sign once and @xmath53 appears to change sign twice and various superconvergence sum rules are all obeyed by our ff s fig.(7,8 ) . by way of comparison , our analysis strongly indicates that @xmath54 does not change sign . neglecting logaritmic factors ( which we can not resolve ) , this would suggest ( for power law behavior ) that @xmath55",
    "nucleon time - like magnetic ff have been obtained in an almost model independent way by means of dr for @xmath56 , using a regularization method in conjunction with space and time - like data .",
    "resonances have been found consistent with the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
    "however , a very large @xmath43 width is obtained - as in previous dr analyses .",
    "further work is in progress to understand the sources of discrepancies as well as the relationship of our results with other dr analyses@xcite .",
