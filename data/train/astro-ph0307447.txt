    "in astrophysical fluid dynamics , studies in accretion processes occupy a position of prominence . of such processes , critical ( transonic )",
    "flows  flows which are regular through a critical point  are of great importance  @xcite .",
    "a classic example of such a flow , in the stationary spherically symmetric situation , is the bondi flow  @xcite .",
    "what is striking about the bondi solution is that while it is virtually impossible to numerically generate it in the stationary limit of the hydrodynamic flow , it is easy to lock on to the bondi solution when the temporal evolution of the flow is followed .",
    "this dynamic and non - perturbative selection mechanism of the transonic solution is in very favourable agreement with bondi s conjecture that it is the criterion of minimum energy that will make the transonic solution the favoured one  @xcite .",
    "the appeal of the spherically symmetric flow , however , is somewhat pedagogic , limited as it is by its not accounting for the fact that in a reasonably realistic situation , the infalling matter would be in possession of angular momentum  and hence the process of infall should lead to the formation of what is known as an accretion disc . a well understood and quite regularly invoked model of such a system is the inviscid and thin accretion disc  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we show how such a physical system  studied in its stationary limit  gives rise to saddle point like behaviour for at least one of the critical points of the flow .",
    "the adverse implications regarding the realizability of a solution passing through such a point is then addressed by considering the system in a real non - linear time evolution .",
    "a simplified mathematical analog of such a situation shows that the evolution indeed selects the critical ( transonic ) solution .",
    "finally , we discuss that in the vicinity of the critical point , the resulting perturbation equation arising out of a linear stability analysis of the stationary solutions , quite closely resembles the metric of an acoustic black hole , and that is probably the signal that trajectories pass through the critical point in a unidirectional fashion .",
    "the flow system to be considered is an axisymmetric thin disc of a compressible astrophysical fluid , with a thickness @xmath0  @xcite . in the vertical direction",
    "the flow is considered to be in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the governing equations for the flow should therefore be the equation of continuity and the equations for momentum balance in both the radial and the azimuthal directions . it is customary to write the stationary flow equations in the following notation  @xcite .    * equation of continuity : @xmath1 * radial momentum balance equation : @xmath2 * angular momentum balance equation : @xmath3    in the above , @xmath4 is the radial velocity , @xmath5 is the radial distance , @xmath6 is the angular velocity , @xmath7 is the keplarian angular velocity defined as @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the velocity of sound defined as @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the effective viscosity of shakura and sunyaev  @xcite .",
    "it is a standard practice to make use of a general polytropic equation of state @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants , with @xmath14 being the polytropic exponent  @xcite , whose admissible range @xmath15 is restricted by the isothermal limit and the adiabatic limit respectively .",
    "the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium along a direction perpendicular to the thin disc , allows for the use of the approximation @xmath16 , where @xmath17  @xcite . in that case",
    "( 1 ) leads to @xmath18 where @xmath19 . combining eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and  ( 4 ) yields , @xmath20\\ ] ] and a first integral of eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant of integration .",
    "we now consider the inviscid limit of eq .",
    "( 6 ) by setting @xmath23 .",
    "this , somewhat simplifying , prescription has found regular favour in accretion literature  @xcite , and it gives the condition @xmath24 , where @xmath22 , which can be physically identified as the specific angular momentum of the flow , now becomes a constant of the motion .",
    "such a constraint allows us to fix the critical points of the flow . at such points both the numerator and the denominator in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) vanish simultaneously  @xcite , and this will deliver the critical point conditions as @xmath25 with the subscripted label @xmath26 indicating critical ( fixed ) point values",
    ". we should be able to find @xmath27 and @xmath28 from eqs .",
    "the second relation above , which is actually a quadratic in @xmath28 , leads us to @xmath29\\ ] ] and this gives the two critical points at radii @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with @xmath32 . to fix",
    "the critical point coordinates @xmath33 , we need to look at the integral of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , which reads as @xmath34 in which the constant of integration has been determined with the help of the boundary condition that for very great radial distances , the speed of sound approaches a constant  ambient \" value @xmath35 , while @xmath36 . in this expression",
    "we use the condition @xmath37 and the value of @xmath28 from eq .",
    "( 8) , to fix @xmath38 in terms of the constants of the system .",
    "this will in turn fix the critical point coordinates @xmath33 .",
    "to have any understanding of the nature of the critical points of the inviscid and thin disc being studied here , we need to cast the equation giving the stationary solutions of the disc system , along the lines of a dynamical system . to do that we appeal to eq .",
    "( 5 ) and parametrize it in the form @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ { \\frac{dr}{d \\tau } } & = & r\\left[v^2-{\\frac{2{c_s}^2}{\\gamma + 1 } } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is to be noted that the parametrization has been carried out in an arbitrary mathematical parameter space @xmath40 , and in such a space the two equations above represent a dynamical system . to analyse the nature of the fixed points , we expand and linearize about the fixed point coordinates @xmath41 in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) , and in terms of the perturbed quantities we obtain a set of linear equations given by @xmath42 \\nonumber \\\\ { \\frac{d}{d \\tau}}\\left({\\delta}r \\right ) & = & { r_c}\\left[{\\frac{2 \\gamma}{\\gamma + 1 } } { \\delta}v^2 + 5{\\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma + 1}}{v_c}^2{\\delta}r \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] use of solutions of the form @xmath43 would deliver the eigenvalues @xmath44  growth rates of @xmath45 and @xmath46  as @xmath47\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and the local keplerian angular momentum is @xmath49 .",
    "it is now quite evident that if @xmath28 is the outer fixed point @xmath50 , then @xmath51 is positive and the fixed point is saddle type , while if @xmath28 is the inner point @xmath52 , then @xmath51 is negative and the fixed point is centre type .",
    "we show the trajectories in fig.1 , in which the arrows indicate the direction of flows .",
    "the fixed point @xmath53 at @xmath31 is the saddle . in a manner of speaking",
    ", it may be dubbed the  sonic point \" because one of the two trajectories passing through it is transonic , rising from subsonic values far from it to supersonic values when @xmath54 .",
    "this trajectory is shown as the heavy solid curve , and is the accretion flow .",
    "the heavy dashed curve is the wind .",
    "the above demonstration that the fixed point @xmath53 is a saddle has adverse implications regarding the realizability of the transonic trajectory passing through it .",
    "conventional wisdom about the nature of saddle type points  @xcite gives us to believe that if we go directly to the static limit of the dynamic evolution , then the transonic trajectory would not be realizable .",
    "however , it is generally believed that transonic trajectories do occur in astrophysical systems such as the one being studied here  @xcite .",
    "our contention is that it is the temporal evolution of such a system that selects the transonic trajectory .",
    "this selection mechanism is purely non - perturbative as opposed to the perturbative technique of a linear stability analysis of all physically feasible stationary inflow solutions .",
    "the latter method offers us no clue as to the choice of the system for any particular solution , since all stationary solutions have been found to be stable under the influence of a linearized perturbation  considered both as a travelling wave and a standing wave  @xcite .    as an aside",
    "it may also be mentioned here that the nature of the outer fixed point @xmath53 in fig.1 , has a bearing on the possible range of values that the constant specific angular momentum @xmath22 may be allowed . for solutions passing through the outer critical point",
    ", it can be well recognized that the flow would be sub - keplerian  @xcite . in that case",
    ", it may be concluded that the condition @xmath55 would hold good .",
    "in addition to that , from eq .",
    "( 12 ) , the saddle type behaviour of the point @xmath53 would also imply that there would be another upper bound on @xmath22 , given by @xmath56 .",
    "for the admissible range of the polytropic index @xmath14 , the possible range for @xmath57 would be @xmath58 .",
    "this would then imply that the latter bound on @xmath22 would be more restrictive , as compared to the former .",
    "it is interesting that this essentially physical conclusion could be drawn from modelling the disc as a dynamical system in a mathematical parameter space .",
    "in the previous section we contended that the temporal evolution of the disc system selects a critical solution that passes through the outer critical point . to understand how this comes about",
    ", we consider a simplified mathematical example , since it is well known that the equations of a compressible flow can not be exactly integrated .",
    "the model system that we introduce , describes the dynamics of @xmath59 as @xmath60 whose static limit yields @xmath61 and which , viewed as dynamical system , is seen as @xmath62    in the @xmath63 space , the fixed points @xmath64 are to be found at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . as in the preceding section ,",
    "a linear stability analysis of the fixed points in @xmath40 space gives the eigenvalues @xmath44 by @xmath67 .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath65 is a saddle point while @xmath66 is a centre type point .",
    "the integral curves are @xmath68 and the trajectories passing through the saddle point are the ones with @xmath69 .",
    "the different possible trajectories are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the separatrices are shown as the heavy solid curve and the heavy dashed curve .",
    "the similarity between figs.1 & 2 is obvious . we now explore the dynamics .    to obtain a solution to eq .",
    "( 13 ) , we need to apply the method of characteristics  @xcite .",
    "this involves writing @xmath70 the task is to find two constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 from the above set and the general solution of eq .",
    "( 13 ) would be given by @xmath73 , where the function @xmath74 is to be determined from the initial conditions .",
    "it is easy to see that one of the constants of integration is clearly the @xmath26 of eq .",
    "hence , we write @xmath75 and from the first part of eq .  ( 17 ) , we can write @xmath76 which solves the problem in principle . to put this in a usable form",
    ", we need to carry out the integration of eq .  (",
    "18 ) . this can not be done exactly . for small @xmath77 ( the most important region , since it is near the saddle ) , we can drop the @xmath78 term to a good approximation .",
    "further , we choose only the positive sign in the right hand side of eq .  ( 18 ) by the physical argument that we would wish to evolve the system through a positive range of @xmath79 ( time ) values . integration of eq .  ( 18 ) will then lead us to the result @xmath80 which will then make the solution of eq .",
    "( 13 ) look like @xmath81e^{-{\\sqrt 3}t}\\right)\\ ] ]    we wish to study the evolution of the system from the initial condition @xmath82 for all @xmath77 at @xmath83 . for small @xmath77 ,",
    "dropping the @xmath78 term again , allows us to determine the form of the function @xmath74 as @xmath84 .",
    "the solution , consequently , becomes @xmath85 ^ 2 e^{-2{\\sqrt{3}}t}\\ ] ] and as @xmath86 , we select the separatrices given by @xmath87 a result whose remarkable feature is worth stressing .",
    "the evolution started far away from the separatrix .",
    "in fact , it started as @xmath82 for all @xmath77 at @xmath83 .",
    "the evolution proceeded through a myriad of stationary states ( all arguably stable under a linear stability analysis ) and then locked on to the separatrix .",
    "our claim is that this dynamic mechanism selects the velocity profile in the practical situation as well , and this is entirely in consonance with a similar and well established selection mechanism for the spherically symmetric flow  @xcite .",
    "in a previous section we discussed that linear stability analysis of the stationary inflow solutions offers no direct clue as to the preference of the disc system for a particular stationary solution .",
    "however , in a somewhat indirect approach to this issue we could make use of a linear stability analysis to have a feel for the special feature of the critical solution . a very convenient way of carrying out the linear stability analysis is in terms of the variable @xmath88  @xcite . in terms of this variable ,",
    "the perturbation equation for @xmath89 reads @xmath90=0\\ ] ] in which @xmath91 is the perturbation on the steady solution of @xmath89 , and the subscripted label @xmath92 indicates steady state values wherever in use  @xcite .    in a spacetime with metric @xmath93 ,",
    "the wave equation for a scalar variable is  @xcite @xmath94 ignoring the angle variables , and using the notation that @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath79 and @xmath96 corresponds to @xmath5 , we have the identification @xmath97 the effective covariant components are @xmath98 in which @xmath99 .    the differential distance in the metric space has the form @xmath100\\ ] ] and this is to be compared with the painlev - gullstrand form of @xmath101 for a rotating black hole of mass @xmath102 @xmath103    we now note from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that at the sonic point , @xmath104 $ ] , and hence in the vicinity of the sonic point the metric implied by the linear stability analysis of the stationary solution appears quite close in form to the metric of a rotating black hole .",
    "the unidirectional nature of trajectories near a black hole suggests that trajectories go through the sonic point , which is equivalent to saying that transonic trajectories will be chosen .    in concluding we would also like to comment on the nature of the possible critical point(s ) when we consider the more likely case of a disc with a mechanism for the outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "it is possible with the help of eq .",
    "( 6 ) to expand and linearize about the critical point value of the angular velocity @xmath6 , but without any knowledge of an exact dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath5 , there would be no way of fixing the critical point(s ) .",
    "however it can be conceived that as an extension of the inviscid case , there may be multiple parameter - dependent critical points  @xcite and in that event at least one of them may be saddle type , with all its associated difficulties within the stationary framework itself . in that event , once again the selection mechanism has to be time evolutionary in nature .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
