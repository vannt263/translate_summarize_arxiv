    "thermodynamic quantities such as the specific heat become non - analytic at a critical point associated with a second order phase transition . for a finite ( or confined ) system with a finite dimension such as a film characterized by a length @xmath0 , close enough to the critical point such that the correlation length becomes comparable or larger than @xmath0 , such thermodynamic quantities are significantly altered ;",
    "the reason is that the degrees of freedom of the system are correlated to each other over the entire system .",
    "examples of such confined systems are ( a ) a film of thickness @xmath0 where the system is confined in one spatial dimension , ( b ) a bar - like geometry with cross - section @xmath1 and infinite length ( such a pore or a wire ) where the system is confined in its two spatial dimensions or ( c ) a cubic geometry of size @xmath2 where the system is finite in all three dimensions . for any thermodymamic observable",
    "we can define a system specific dimensionless quantity , a scaling function@xcite ; for example , in the case of the specific heat near the critical point and for sufficiently large @xmath0 we may define the following scaling function : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the reduced temperature and @xmath5 is the specific heat for the case of the system confined within a finite length @xmath0 . for a given case of confining geometry and",
    "given the condition which the order parameter satisfies at the boundaries of the system , as @xmath0 approaches infinity and @xmath6 , the scaling function depends only on the value of the combination @xmath7 , namely on the length @xmath0 in units of the correlation length @xmath8 . a dimensionless function such as @xmath9 defined by eq .",
    "[ scal1 ] can be thought of as a universal scaling function for the specific heat for a well - defined confining geometry .",
    "in other words , the scaling function does not depend on the microscopic details , but only depends on the nature of the universality class of the system , the confining geometry and the boundary conditions which are felt by the order parameter .    in this limit ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) the scaling function is different for the three different cases mentioned previously for the following reason : for a fixed value of @xmath12 and for any large value of @xmath0 there is always a sufficiently small value of @xmath13 satisfying the condition where the correlation length is much larger than @xmath0 . however , in this limit the case ( a ) is the case of a 2d plane , the case ( b ) is the case of a 1d line and the case ( c ) is the zero - dimensional case .",
    "thus the value @xmath9 for sufficiently small values of @xmath14 should be very different for these three geometries .",
    "though earlier experiments on superfluid helium films of finite thickness @xcite seemed to confirm the validity of the finite - size - scaling(fss ) , there were later experiments@xcite where it was shown that the superfluid density of thick helium films does not satisfy fss when the expected values of critical exponents were used .",
    "similarly , in measurements of the specific heat of helium in finite geometries , other than the expected values for the critical exponents were found @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments in microgravity environment@xcite as well as earth bound experiments@xcite are consistent with scaling and they have determined the specific heat scaling function for the parallel plate ( film ) geometry ( case ( a ) ) and they are in reasonable agreement with the scaling function as was predicted by monte carlo simulations@xcite and renormalization group techniques@xcite .",
    "while the specific heat scaling function for case ( b ) confinement has been theoretically determined@xcite and it was found to be significantly suppressed relative to the case ( a ) there are so - far no experimental data to compare .",
    "more recently , the specific heat scaling function for the case ( c ) has been experimentally determined@xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present the results of our monte carlo simulations to determine the specific heat scaling function for cubes with open boundary conditions ( bc ) in all three directions ( confining case ( c ) ) . in this case",
    "the scaling function characterizes the zero - dimensional to three - dimensional transition .",
    "our results for the scaling function are compared to the very recently obtained experimental results for specific heat scaling function in the case of cubic confinement@xcite .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement with no free parameters .",
    "in addition , we present results for the specific heat scaling function for the parallel plate geometry on lattices of size @xmath15 with @xmath16 where we have applied periodic bc along the @xmath17-directions and open bc along the film - thickness direction of size @xmath0 .",
    "the latter case was carried out in order to compare the results for _ dirichlet bc _ ( on the top and bottom of the film ) obtained earlier@xcite . in refs",
    "@xcite it was found that while the results with periodic bc along the film - thickness direction were very different from those obtained with dirichlet bc , the results obtained with dirichlet bc fit the experimental results with no free parameter . in this paper",
    "we find that the scaling function obtained with open bc along the finite dimension is close to that obtained with dirichlet and also fits reasonably well the experimental results obtained by the so - called confined helium experiment@xcite ( chex ) .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of the scaling behavior of the specific heat of @xmath18 in a cubic and in a film geometry at temperatures close to the critical temperature @xmath19 .",
    "the superfluid transition of liquid @xmath18 belongs to the universality class of the three - dimensional @xmath20 model , thus , we are going to use this model to compute the specific heat at temperatures near @xmath19 using the cluster monte - carlo method @xcite . the @xmath20 model on a lattice",
    "is defined as @xmath21 where the summation is over all nearest neighbors , @xmath22 is a two - component vector which is constrained to be on the unit circle and @xmath23 sets the energy scale .",

    "open ( free ) boundary conditions were applied in all directions , namely the spins on the surface of the cube are free to take any value .",
    "these spins interact only with the 5 nearest neighbors , one in the interior and 4 on the surface of the cube and there is one missing neighbor .",
    "we have also calculated the specific heat scaling function @xmath38 ( to be defined in the following section ) for the case of the parallel plate geometry @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) using periodic boundary conditions along the long directions of the film and open bc along the thickness direction @xmath0 . for this case",
    "we need to take the limit @xmath41 first ; in ref .  @xcite it was found that using @xmath42 was large enough , in the sense that systematic errors due to the finite - size effects from the fact that @xmath17 are not infinite are smaller than the statistical errors for realistic computational time scales .",
    "the present simulations for films were done on lattices @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we used the monte carlo method and in particular wolff s cluster algorithm@xcite .",
    "we carried out of the order of 30,000 mc steps for thermalization to obtain equilibrium configurations .",
    "we made of the order of 10,000 - 50,000 measurements allowing 500 mc steps between successive measurements to obtain statistically uncorrelated configurations .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to present a calculation of the specific heat scaling function for the case of cubic confinement and open bc . in this calculation",
    "we have used open bc in all three directions of the cube . we found that using open bc the results for the specific heat scaling were very close to those obtained with dirichlet bc .",
    "this will be demonstrated in the next section where we compare the previously published results@xcite for films with dirichlet bc and results reported in this paper for films with open bc .",

    "@xcite periodic bc along the @xmath17-directions and staggered ( dirichlet ) bc or periodic along the film - thickness direction of size @xmath0 were applied .",
    "it was found that while the calculated scaling function for the parallel - plate geometry using periodic bc along all three directions was very different from that obtained with dirichlet bc along the top and bottom of the plate and periodic bc along the other two long directions , the latter scaling function fits the experimental results with no free parameter .",
    "this was explained on the basis that physically the order parameter along the film thickness vanishes at the boundaries of the film and therefore dirichlet bc are more appropriate .    in this paper",
    "we have used open bc along the top and the bottom of the plate , instead of dirichlet , and periodic bc along the two long directions of the plate . since the film terminates on the top and on the bottom surface , for the pseudospins which belong to these two surfaces ( in language of the @xmath20 model )",

    "therefore , even if we use open ( free ) boundary conditions this termination acts as `` a zero order parameter constraint '' beyond the top and the bottom of the plate .",
