    "recent observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) at both optical and near - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that the very centers of late - type spiral galaxies are often occupied by a photometrically distinct , luminous , and compact ( with a few parsec diameter ) stellar cluster .",
    "most of the nuclear star clusters studied in detail appear to have experienced recent star formation .",
    "for example , m33 @xcite , ngc4449 @xcite , as well as ngc247 and ngc2403 @xcite all have nuclear clusters with a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that is dominated by a young ( @xmath9 ) stellar population . clearly , these galaxies must recently have experienced significant inflow of molecular gas into their central few parsec in order to trigger the formation of these young clusters .",
    "there is mounting evidence that large - scale bars can efficiently move large quantities of molecular gas down to the inner kiloparsec @xcite .",
    "however , the exact mechanism which can transport gas from a few hundred parsec down to a few parsec is still under debate .",
    "ic  342 is a prime example of a late - type spiral galaxy with a young luminous nuclear cluster which formed in a short - lived burst about @xmath10 ago @xcite . for this paper ,",
    "we adopt the distance of @xmath11 derived by @xcite which makes ic342 the closest late - type galaxy with strong nuclear star formation .",
    "it thus offers a unique opportunity to study the related gas dynamics on scales of a few parsec ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the central region of ic  342 has been mapped in the past in several molecular transitions on scales of a few arcseconds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these maps show that the molecular gas is located in two spiral arms which show strong streaming motions .",
    "the spiral arms join to form a ring of about @xmath13 diameter which is the site of massive star formation @xcite . in this letter , we present a high resolution , high sensitivity @xmath1  map which for the first time resolves the molecular gas kinematics _ inside _ the starburst ring .",
    "the center of ic  342 was observed in the @xmath1  line in january 2002 with the six - element owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter interferometer .",
    "obtained in the l and h configurations with baselines between 15 and @xmath14 , the data have a spatial resolution of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with robust weighting .",
    "the noise per @xmath17 wide channel is @xmath18 per beam in the combined data of both tracks . for the intensity map",
    ", we used only emission that is @xmath19 above the noise floor and evident in at least two adjacent channels .",
    "similarly , we used a @xmath20 blanking for the velocity field to emphasize the small - scale velocity structure . nevertheless , our data recover most of the co flux in the region mapped , as the peak integrated intensity of our data convolved to @xmath21 resolution is about 90% of the value of @xmath22 measured with the iram 30 m single dish telescope @xcite .",
    "the absolute astrometry of the ovro observations are tied to the vla quasar reference frame , which are known to @xmath23",
    ". however , the positional uncertainty in the observations is limited by atmospheric refraction at 230 ghz and is @xmath24 .    for comparison to the co data , we retrieved _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "v - band ( f555w ) and @xmath25  ( + continuum , f658n ) maps from the newly available wfpc2 associations archive . in order to register the hst images and the co maps , we aligned the eastern co spiral arm to the prominent dust lane seen in both hst images .",
    "incidentally , this also aligned the central co peak with the nuclear star cluster .",
    "the alignment required a nominal shift of @xmath26 to the west and @xmath27 to the north .",
    "potential discrepancies of this magnitude between hst and radio coordinate systems are not uncommon ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* co distribution and geometry : * the intensity map in figure  [ fig : co ] partly resolves the structure of the two well - known molecular spiral arms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two arms have quite different morphologies : the eastern arm forms a continuous spiral which is barely resolved with our data . a second",
    ", weaker component about @xmath28 east of the main arm is also apparent in the map .",
    "the western arm , on the other hand , has two main components : a southern part pointing toward the nucleus , and a northern part ( north of @xmath29 ) which seems to form another spiral .",
    "the western arm is about @xmath28 wide and has a sharp inner edge , but becomes more diffuse toward larger radii .",
    "the mean gas density within the spiral arms is @xmath30 , assuming an intrinsic line ratio of @xmath31/@xmath32= 1 and the standard galactic conversion factor of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "these values translate into an average gas surface densities of @xmath34 ( including a 36% contribution from he ) , with peak values about twice as high .",
    "the map reveals somewhat weaker emission inside the central trough that has been identified for the first time .",
    "because this emission component has a disk - like morphology and appears centered on the nuclear star cluster ( see below ) , we refer to it as the _ nuclear disk _ for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the disk has a major axis diameter of @xmath3 and a gas mass of @xmath35 , with a mean gas density about half of that in the spiral arms .",
    "the disk appears connected to both spiral arms via two faint co `` bridges '' @xmath36 north and south of the nucleus .",
    "+   + * co kinematics : * the overall motion of the molecular gas is from southwest to northeast , in agreement with the position angle of the kinematic major axis of @xmath37 determined from hi data @xcite .",
    "the arms of the gas spiral show strong streaming motions , and are interpreted as gas lanes along the leading side of a weak stellar bar @xcite . on smaller scales , the co velocity field within the spiral arms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) does not appear well ordered since the line emission consists of multiple components .",
    "the high spatial and spectral resolution of the ovro data allows us to identify non - circular gas motions close to the center of ic  342 .",
    "the molecular gas is moving along a position angle of @xmath38 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : co ] and [ fig : renzo ] ) which is offset by @xmath39 from the kinematic major axis of the galaxy disk .",
    "this is the first time that non - circular motions within @xmath16 of the nucleus have been detected in ic  342 , their nature is discussed further in section [ sec : feed ] . within the spatial resolution of our observations ,",
    "the central co peak coincides with the dynamical center as well as the nuclear star cluster , and the systemic velocity we measure is @xmath40 .",
    "this value is @xmath41 higher than inferred from lower resolution co(1 - 0 ) data ( @xmath42 * ? ? ?",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the non - circular nature of the nuclear co kinematics which only becomes more apparent at high angular resolution .",
    "+   + * comparison to optical morphology : * the distribution of the molecular gas differs from that of the stellar inventory as demonstrated by the comparison of the hst images to the co distribution ( fig . [",
    "fig : hst ] ) .",
    "the co spiral arms outline the bright central emission region that is evident in both the h@xmath43 emission and the v - band continuum .",
    "both the line emission and the optical continuum are brighter east of the nucleus where the co emission is confined to the prominent dust lane .",
    "in addition , optical light fills the gap between the two eastern gas lanes . on the other hand , west of the nucleus where the co spiral is much wider",
    ", there is a lack of h@xmath43 emission and optical continuum .",
    "this asymmetry in the extinction pattern together with the velocity field suggests that the western side is the near side of ic  342 .",
    "a prominent h@xmath43 knot lies on the boundary ( -@xmath44;-@xmath45 ) between the two parts of the western gas spiral , it coincides with region  1 studied by @xcite and is the site of intense star formation . within the nuclear disk ,",
    "the peak of the molecular gas ( which is close to the dynamical center , see ",
    "[ sec : data ] ) coincides roughly with the nuclear star cluster .",
    "two other star clusters north and south of the nucleus fall into regions inside the spiral arms which are almost devoid of molecular line emission .",
    "the hst v - band image shows two fine dust lanes of @xmath46 width about @xmath45 north and south of the nucleus which extend in east - west direction ( best seen in fig . [",
    "fig : renzo ] ) .",
    "the two co bridges that connect the nuclear disk to the spiral arms appear to coincide with these dust lanes , although the lower spatial resolution of the co map makes this identification somewhat tentative .",
    "* what drives the gas inflow ? * the overall shape and kinematics of the co spiral arms are reminiscent of models for gas flows in a weakly barred potential ( e.g. athanassoula 1992 ) .",
    "although no stellar bar is obvious in the optical data , ellipse fits to deep wide - field ccd images show evidence for a bar with @xmath47 length and a position angle of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "since the western side is the near side ( see   [ sec : data ] ) , the sense of rotation is counter - clockwise , and therefore the gas spiral arms are on the leading side of this large - scale bar . @xcite",
    "interpret the displacement of the optical and dynamical position angles and the warped outer hi disk as signs of a recent mild interaction .",
    "this interaction might have triggered the formation of the oval distortion which in turn might be responsible for the pile - up of molecular gas in the central kiloparsec of ic342 .",
    "the molecular gas morphology of ic  342 is quite similar to the one observed in the center of our own galaxy where a @xmath49 wide molecular disk or torus is surrounded by a molecular ring with a radius of @xmath50 ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "also , the bar length of @xmath51 in ic  342 is comparable to the @xmath52 observed in our galaxy . the filamentary structure of the dust / gas lanes and the h@xmath43 emission in ic  342 ( similar filaments are also observed in the inner @xmath53 of our galaxy ) might be explained by self - gravitating gas ( see fig . 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the coincidence of the co disk s central velocity with systemic velocity favors a scenario in which the gas lies within the disk , as opposed to being situated above the plane .",
    "the in - plane picture is supported by the good agreement between the gas distribution and the dust morphology .",
    "+ in the following we will discuss three plausible interpretations of the co morphology .",
    "first , the nuclear co disk could be tilted relative to the large stellar disk .",
    "the axis ratio of the nuclear disk of @xmath54 translates into an inclination of @xmath55 along a position angle of @xmath56 .",
    "the two co peaks about @xmath57 north and south of the center are separated in velocity by @xmath58 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : renzo ] ) . assuming solid body rotation and that these two peaks fall on the kinematic major axis of the nuclear disk ,",
    "the resulting dynamical mass is @xmath59 .",
    "the derived mass is significantly smaller than the mass estimated for either the nuclear molecular gas disk or the nuclear stellar cluster ( @xmath60 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) making this an unlikely scenario .",
    "a second alternative is that the nuclear co emission originates in a virialized cloud , rather than a rotating disk . for a cloud size of about @xmath61 and a co line width ( fwhm ) of @xmath62 ,",
    "the virialized mass is @xmath63 .",
    "however , the observed rotation ( see fig . [",
    "fig : renzo ] ) within the nuclear disk argues against a single virialized cloud . in a third scenario ,",
    "the observed non - circular motion are due to radial motions of material moving toward the center similar to what is observed in the central region of our galaxy @xcite . since the first two scenarios seem unlikely",
    ", we conclude that streaming motions are the most plausible explanation for the non - circular motions observed in the co kinematics . a possible cause for",
    "such streaming motion could be the large - scale stellar bar .",
    "this scenario should be investigated further by dynamical modeling . +   + * feeding the nuclear star cluster : * the nuclear star cluster in ic342 has a mass of @xmath60 and experienced a major burst of star formation @xmath64 ago @xcite .",
    "the population of stars produced in this event dominates the sed of the cluster , and thus makes it difficult to quantify the contribution from possible older generation(s ) of stars . as discussed in @xcite , up to 90% of the cluster mass",
    "could have been produced in a burst that occurred @xmath65 before the most recent one .",
    "while this number is definitely an upper limit because the described scenario lies at the extreme end of possible star formation histories , it is reasonable to assume that previous nuclear starburst events have indeed occurred . for the moment",
    ", we will assume that the most recent burst produced 30% of the cluster mass , i.e. about @xmath66 .",
    "assuming a star formation efficiency of 20% @xcite , about @xmath67 of molecular gas are needed in order to produce such a starburst event .",
    "this is 50 times more than the present - day mass of the nuclear co disk ( @xmath68@xmath69 ) . in",
    "what follows , we use our co observations to constrain the inflow rate of molecular gas and to estimate how long it might take before another such starburst event can occur . + a lower limit can be calculated by assuming that it took the full @xmath10 since the last starburst for the nuclear co disk to form . in this case , the inflow rate is @xmath70 or about 3 gyr are needed before a new starburst event could occur .",
    "we derive an upper limit by taking the observed gas surface density of @xmath71 together with the width of the two dust lanes seen in the v - band image ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this yields an estimate of the gas inflow rate onto the nuclear disk of @xmath72 .",
    "the inflow velocity of the gas , @xmath73 can be estimated by comparing the observed circular velocity in the nuclear disk ( @xmath74 at a radius of @xmath57 or @xmath75 ) to the maximum expected circular velocity around the nuclear star cluster ( assuming solid body rotation ) , @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that radial motions of up to @xmath77 can be present in the molecular gas next to the nuclear cluster , depending on the exact shape of the gravitational potential .",
    "these rough estimates result in an inflow rate of @xmath78 .",
    "such an inflow rate would accumulate about @xmath67 of molecular gas in the nucleus within @xmath79 .",
    "these two estimates probably bracket the actual inflow rate , but a number of uncertainties remain .",
    "for one , the @xmath80  mass in the center of ic  342 might be overestimated by a factor of 4 - 5 due to the use of a galactic conversion factor , as discussed in @xcite . in addition",
    ", the non - circular motions can be overestimated due to the unknown shape of the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "nevertheless , the inflow rates discussed here are not unreasonable to support repetitive nuclear starbursts in ic342 . for example",
    ", an accumulation of @xmath81 is sufficient to support a starburst duty cycle of about @xmath82 .",
    "the duty cycle might even be shorter if the star formation efficiency is higher than the 20% assumed here .",
    "indeed , efficiencies up to 50% have been inferred for giant molecular clouds in the spiral arms of ic  342 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the inflow rate is likely to vary over time with lower inflow rates in the past , and could increase in the future as more mass is accumulated at the center . for example , assuming a constant rate of @xmath83 ( our lower limit ) over a hubble time ( @xmath84 ) results in a mass accumulation of @xmath85 which is larger than the dynamical mass of @xmath86 derived for the central 120pc @xcite . +",
    "our analysis of new high - resolution maps of the @xmath1  emission in the center of ic342 has revealed the following main results .",
    "we detect molecular gas coinciding with the nuclear stellar cluster .",
    "this , and the presence of streaming motions close to the nucleus , suggests that gaseous matter is currently accumulating at the nucleus of ic342 .",
    "these findings provide support for in - situ formation of nuclear clusters and repetitive nuclear starbursts .",
    "rough estimates of gas inflow rates suggest that massive ( @xmath87 ) nuclear starbursts in ic342 can be supported with duty cycles between a few hundred myrs and 1 gyrs .",
