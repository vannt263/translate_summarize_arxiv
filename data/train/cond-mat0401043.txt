    "the interplay of quantum mechanical interference and electron - electron interaction in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has attracted a lot of experimental and theoretical interest in recent years.@xcite experimentally the ground state properties of a qd can be probed by coulomb blockade ( cb ) measurements at near - zero temperature , in which the conductance through the dot is blocked except at particular gate voltages , causing the conductance as a function of gate voltage to be a series of sharp peaks . in particular , the spacing between neighboring peaks is related to the second difference of the ground state energy with respect to electron number @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which is often called the addition energy .",
    "the ground state spin of the dot can be inferred from the motion of the peak position in a magnetic field.@xcite except in small dots with high geometrical symmetry,@xcite whose ground state properties show shell structure following hund s rules , most experimental qds are asymmetric due to either the irregular shape of the confining gate or impurity disorder , and the number of electrons is usually several hundred.@xcite the properties of qds show apparently random but reproducible fluctuations as some external parameters such as the chemical potential , the shape of the confining potential , external magnetic field and so on , vary . in this case , only statistical properties are of physical significance .",
    "while the statistical behavior of peak height fluctuations can be well described by a non - interacting random matrix theory ( rmt ) model,@xcite a similar model , the constant interaction ( ci ) plus rmt , fails dramatically in describing the peak spacing distribution .",
    "the importance of e - e interaction was well recognized , but different theoretical approaches differ quantitatively or even qualitatively in many aspects of e - e interactions effects . the numerical studies for small dots@xcite yield a gaussian - like peak spacing distribution without any even / odd pairing effect , which agrees with experimental results on much larger dots .",
    "on the other hand , the statistical approaches for large dots@xcite predict a much more pronounced even / odd effect at zero temperature that is absent in experimental results.@xcite    besides conductance peak spacings , another quantity that has attracted a lot of interest is the ground state spin in the cb regime . the occurrence of non - minimal ground state spin has been suggested as an explanation for the absence of a bi - modal distribution in conductance peak spacings,@xcite and for the kinks in the parametric motion of the peaks.@xcite a recent experimental study on the change in cb peak position as a function of magnetic filed by folk , et al.@xcite found that three out of five even-@xmath4 states had @xmath5 . as in the case of peak spacing distributions ,",
    "previous theoretical studies on ground state spin distributions in qds gave very different results : simulations on small tight - binding lattice models with random site energies predict a dominant fraction of high spin ground states,@xcite but results from ks - sdft studies of small disordered parabolic quantum dots@xcite showed that the probability of high - spin ground states never exceeds @xmath6 even in the strong interaction regime .    despite intensive efforts to understand the role of e - e interaction in qd systems , there are still many questions that require further investigation .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the following issues : ( 1 ) the first one is concerned with the evolution of statistical properties of qds as the interaction strength increases .",
    "the e - e interaction strength is usually characterized by the wigner - seitz radius @xmath7 , which is defined in 2d as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron density and @xmath10 is bohr radius.@xcite previous theoretical studies gave different answers to this question , indicating the necessity of further theoretical exploration . in the meantime , this issue has attracted the experimental interest , and some relevant experiments are underway .",
    "( 2 ) the second issue to be explored is the effect of confining potential .",
    "previous theoretical studies were based on abstract statistical assumptions , chaotic model external potentials , or gaussian impurities .",
    "none of them have considered the realistic confining potential imposed in actual experiments . though it is usually assumed that the statistical properties of qds are of universal significance",
    ", the validity of that is still to be verified . (",
    "3 ) the third issue that is worthy of further elaboration is how statistical properties of qds evolve as the size of a qd system , mainly the electron number , increases , which is important not only in solving the puzzling discrepancy between numerical small - dot calculations and semi - analytic large - dot statistical analysis , but also in understanding the fundamental question in mesoscopic physics of how macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic physics via the mesoscopic regime .    in our previous study,@xcite",
    "we reported a kohn - sham spin density functional theory ( ks - sdft ) study of spin and conductance peak spacing distributions in 2d isolated quantum dots in a classically chaotic quartic oscillator potential with electron number @xmath2 up to 200 at @xmath11 .",
    "we found that for large electron number and asymmetric external potential , the peak spacing distribution is mainly gaussian - like and there is no observable even / odd effects .",
    "we also found enhanced probability of high spin ground state implying stronger interaction effects than expected from rpa approaches . in this paper , we extend the previous study in two directions : ( 1 ) similar calculations are done for weaker ( @xmath12 ) interactions to investigate how statistical properties of quantum dots evolve as the interaction strength varies .",
    "( 2 ) we extended previous studies in isolated qds , in which electrons are confined by an analytic chaotic potential without explicit consideration of the coupling with external gate , to qd systems in which the confining potential is calculated by solving the electrostatic poisson equation with realistic boundary conditions . in the latter case , with more controllable parameters available , we are able to study statistical properties of qds as a function of both e - e interaction strength ( @xmath7 ) and electron number ( @xmath2 ) in a more systematic way .",

    "we see a striking agreement between tlm - ed and ks - sdft results , which is indeed remarkable considering the extreme simplicity of our two - level model compared to ks - sdft .",
    "both tlm - hf and ed reproduce correctly the saturation of spin distribution at @xmath146 . to explore possible mechanisms for the saturation , fig . [",
    "fig : tlm - rs](b ) plots the mean values of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and the off - diagonal term @xmath145 , ( the other off - diagonal term , @xmath147 , is close to @xmath145 , and is therefore not plotted here ) as a function of @xmath7 . it is clearly shown that off - diagonal terms are an order of magnitude smaller than the coulomb and exchange terms , indicating that the off - diagonal terms are negligible in terms of their contribution to the spin distribution .",
    "this is verified by the general agreement between tlm - hf and tlm - ed . on the other hand ,",
    "[ fig : tlm - rs](b ) shows that though @xmath148 and @xmath149 do saturate at high @xmath7 , @xmath150 does not .",
    "this indicates that considering mean values of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 alone can not explain the saturation in the spin distribution .",
    "we also use the tlm to interpret the effect of finite size on the spin distributions , and the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlm - ne ] .",
    "the simple two - level model also grasps most of the physics : the probability of the triplet ground state calculated from both tlm - ed and hf increases as @xmath2 increases , but saturates at large @xmath2 , in agreement with the ks results .",
    "we note that the difference between different @xmath2 ranges is mainly due to wave functions rather than eigenvalues ( which are always random - matrix like for our system ) ; for a @xmath2-electron system , the wave functions involved in the tlm are @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "our tlm results show clearly that the @xmath2-dependence of the spin distributions comes mainly from the changing statistics of the wave functions .",
    "this is more directly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlm - ne](b ) , where mean values of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 are plotted .",
    "we note that the @xmath2-dependence of wave - function statistics is usually neglected in most statistical theories of quantum dots , where the large @xmath2 limit is usually taken.@xcite since many experimental data were obtained with @xmath2 less than 200 , our studies show clearly the necessity of considering finite @xmath2 effects in interpreting those data .",
    "in this paper , we use kohn - sham spin density functional theory to study electron - electron interaction effects in quantum dots . in particular , we calculated conductance peak spacing and ground state spin distributions in an isolated quantum dot with classically chaotic quartic external potential and in a realistic quantum dot with explicit consideration of the coupling between the dot and the external confining gate . in the former case , as an extension of our previous study , we investigated how the statistical properties evolve when the e - e interaction strength increases from the weak ( @xmath73 ) to moderate regimes ( @xmath153 ) for @xmath154-@xmath155 . in the case of the realistic quantum dots , we first made a direct comparison between isolated and realistic quantum dots , and found that in spite of the difference in the boundary conditions , their statistical properties are qualitatively similar .",
    "we further investigated spin and peak spacing distributions in strong interaction regimes with @xmath156 up to 4.0 and their dependence on the electron number @xmath2 .",
    "the even / odd effect in peak spacing distributions vanishes as @xmath156 increases and becomes weaker as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we close with two comments on our results .",
    "first , our study , as well as other theoretical investigations , have made it quite clear that the lack of even / odd pairing in experimental peak spacing distributions is due to the e - e interaction , and the ci - rmt model is therefore not valid for the description of mesoscopic fluctuations in coulomb blockade peak spacings . in theoretical condensed matter physics",
    ", it is well accepted that the e - e interaction at @xmath11 can be accurately described by many - body perturbation theory , most notably the rpa model",
    ". however , the results obtained from the rpa model combined with a rmt description of single particle properties disagree significantly from those obtained with numerical approaches . understanding the sources for such discrepancies will deepen our general physical picture of quantum dots .",
    "second , our results were obtained under the local spin density approximation within ks - sdft , whose validity , though well established in 3d bulk material systems through decades of experience , is not necessarily well justified for 2d large quantum dots with irregular confining potential and/or in the strong interaction regime . in the small dots for @xmath2 up to about 30 , it is still computationally feasible to check the validity of lsda by comparing with more accurate quantum monte carlo modeling , but not for the large - dot regime ( @xmath157 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistical quantities investigated above are experimentally accessible .",
    "comparing future experimental data with lsda predictions will provide a unique chance to check lsda in real systems ."
