    "in 1964 , the first bell inequality was exploited @xcite . based on local hidden variable model ( lhvm )",
    ", bell inequalities can always give upper bounds on certain quantities .",
    "in quantum mechanics , if a higher value is obtained than these bounds , it is commonly referred to as a quantum violation .",
    "although it has unsatisfactory aspect of applying only to a statistical measurement procedure , the bell inequalities are still of great importance in investigating quantum entanglement @xcite .    inspired by bell s paper , then , clauser , horne , shimony , and holt ( chsh ) @xcite derived a correlation inequality , which involves a bipartite correlation function ( average over many runs of experiment ) for two alternative dichotomic observables .",
    "it has been pointed out that @xcite any pure entangled state of two particles violates the correlation chsh inequality .",
    "later , the studies of bell inequalities are expanded to three - body systems @xcite . for @xmath0-partite quantum system ,",
    "there are several fruitful bell inequalities such as mermin - ardehali - belinski - klyshko ( mabk ) inequalities @xcite , or the more general werner - wolf - ukowski - brukner ( wwzb ) inequalities @xcite , and other type inequalities @xcite . by far ,",
    "bell inequalities are an important tool to investigate the possible connection between nonlocality and entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , with the increase of the parties more and more items ( @xmath1 for wwzb inequalities , for example ) will be a drawback in practice and it is still an important task to seek some optimal bell inequalities .    in this paper , we present a method to construct the scalable bell inequalities for multiqubit systems . based on chsh inequality , we establish a set of bell inequalities , where the number of terms grows exponentially with half of number of particles . in the structure of the present inequalities ,",
    "the standard chsh bell inequality can be obtained for @xmath2 and , as an example , compact mermin - type inequalities are proposed .",
    "consider an @xmath0-qubit system , where each of the parties is allowed to choose independently between two dichotomic observables @xmath3 , @xmath4 for the @xmath5-th observer , @xmath6 , and each outcome can either take value @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "now , we first review a well known bell - type inequality for bipartite systems , chsh inequality @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . obviously , based on absolute lhvm ,",
    "there exist two possible outcomes : @xmath11 and @xmath12 , or @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in terms of the particular relevance ,",
    "then , we provide an efficient algorithm for generating the scalable bell inequalities for multiqubit systems .    in this architecture , elementary units of the present inequalities are paired partitions of chsh polynomial .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath0 is even the polynomials read @xmath15,\\ ] ] for odd @xmath0 we get @xmath16.\\ ] ] actually , for odd @xmath0 , the products can be viewed as considerable generalization by multiplying a pair of trivial polynomials @xmath3 and @xmath4 on any one of the observers @xmath5 , letting @xmath17 , for example . from the relationship between two partitions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , algebraically , we have @xmath20 . in a local classical model , letting @xmath21 denote mean value of @xmath22 , one can show that inequalities @xmath23 holds .",
    "we now investigate quantum violations of the present bell inequalities . as quantum counterpart of the bell",
    "polynomial , bell operator @xmath22 should satisfy inequality @xmath24 where density operator @xmath25 is used to character an @xmath0-partite quantum system .",
    "a quantum violation of one of the inequalities refer to the result of the left hand side of expression ( [ bleq1 ] ) larger than 1 . in generally , quantum mechanically",
    ", one expresses the observables as @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath6 , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 are unit vectors and @xmath30 denotes a vector of pauli matrices .",
    "consider @xmath0-qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath31 notice that it is an eigenstate of operator @xmath32 with eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "as is well known , ghz states maximally violate mermin inequalities @xcite .",
    "the mermin inequalities have @xmath33 terms and bound the values of quantum violation @xmath34 for odd @xmath0 , and @xmath35 for even @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that the present inequalities involve a series of compact mermin - type inequalities . in detail , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , taking the experimental setting @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , we have @xmath43=\\sqrt{2}$ ] . for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we take @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath46 and obtain @xmath43=2 $ ] . for @xmath47 ,",
    "taking @xmath48 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , also , we get @xmath43=2 $ ] . in a word , under the optimal",
    "setting we show that the compact mermin - type inequalities , which have @xmath49 terms for odd @xmath0 and @xmath50 for even @xmath0 , are maximally violated by @xmath0-qubit ghz states with a certain constant visibility @xmath51 or 2 .    as an example",
    ", we now use the present inequalities to test the quantum nonlocality of @xmath0-qubit generalized ghz ( gghz ) states @xmath52 under the specified setting , as already mentioned , one can obtain @xmath53=\\sqrt{2}\\sin{2\\alpha}\\ ] ] for @xmath36 , and @xmath54=2\\sin{2\\alpha}\\ ] ] for the others .",
    "that is , for @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 for @xmath36 ) the present inequalities are violated .",
    "compared with the threshold @xmath57 described in @xcite , we can find that the decrease of items of correlation functions is sometimes at the cost of detecting precision .",
    "next , we analyze the relationship between quantum nonlocality and entanglement for gghz states . for simplicity ,",
    "we here focus on the situation of @xmath58 .",
    "particularly , we recast the four - qubit bell polynomial as @xmath59 and thus the expression ( [ 2sinalpha ] ) holds . on the other hand , consider the four - tangle of four - qubit gghz state @xmath60 where the four - tangle @xmath61 quantifies four - partite entanglement @xcite .",
    "then , we can recover the entanglement - nonlocality relationship @xmath62=2\\sqrt{\\tau}.\\ ] ] by the way , we also note that , for generalized slice - state @xcite @xmath63 the relationship ( [ equation - b - tau ] ) hold . in fig.[picture - b - tau ] , we show the numerical results of quantum nonlocality versus entanglement for the four - qubit gghz states .",
    "the green line is the threshold above which the inequalities are violated .",
    "it has been shown that ( see blue line ) , for @xmath64 , the quantum violation of the present inequality occurs and varies with four - tangle .",
    "also , we plot a relationship between entanglement and the maximum expectation value of a generalized svetlichny operator for four - qubit gghz states @xcite denoted by the red line , where the generalized svetlichny inequality is only violated with @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in a sense , the present inequality is more sensitive to detecting the four - qubit gghz states .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown a fruitful method for constructing a series of correlation bell inequalities for multipartite qubit systems . in the architectures of these bell inequalities , paired",
    "partitions of chsh inequality are exploited . under the optimal",
    "setting we have reported a set of compact mermin - type inequalities and discussed the maximal quantum violations . using the present inequalities , we have studied quantum nonlocality of @xmath0-qubit gghz states .",
    "also , we have obtained a useful relationship between quantum nonlocality and four - partite entanglement for four - qubit gghz states . moreover ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that the total numbers of correlation functions of the present inequalities have been greatly reduced , growing exponentially with half of number of qubits .",
    "together with there are only two dichotomic observables per site , this make it convenient to design a scalable scheme for testing the quantum formalism against the lhvm in experiments .",
