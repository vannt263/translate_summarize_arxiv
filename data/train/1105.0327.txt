    "in the seminal paper @xcite arnold showed that the incompressible euler equations can be seen as geodesic equations on the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms with respect to the @xmath16-metric .",
    "this interpretation was extended to other pdes used in hydrodynamics , some of which are : burgers equation as the geodesic equation for @xmath17 with the @xmath16-metric , camassa - holm equation for @xmath17 with the @xmath18-metric or kdv for the virasoro - bott group with the @xmath16-metric in @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown by wunsch @xcite that the modified constantin - lax - majda equation ( mclm ) is the geodesic equation on the homogeneous space @xmath19 with respect to the homogeneous @xmath20-metric .",
    "the geometric interpretation was used by ebin and marsden in @xcite to show the well - posedness of the euler equations .",
    "these techniques were expanded and applied to other equations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of a pde as the geodesic equation on an infinite dimensional manifold opens up a variety of geometrical questions , which may be asked about the manifold .",
    "what is the curvature of this manifold ?",
    "do geodesics have conjugate points ?",
    "do there exist totally geodesic submanifolds ?",
    "the question we want to concentrate upon in this paper , that of geodesic distance , has a very simple answer in finite dimensions but shows more nuances in infinite dimensions .",
    "the geodesic distance between two points is defined as the infimum of the pathlength over all paths connecting the two points . in finite dimensions , because of the local invertibility of the exponential map , this distance is always positive and the topology of the resulting metric space is the same as the manifold topology .",
    "however , in infinite dimensions , this does not always hold : the induced geodesic distance for weak riemannian metrics on infinite dimensional manifolds may vanish .",
    "this surprising fact was first noticed for the @xmath16-metric on shape space @xmath21 in @xcite .",
    "here @xmath21 denotes the orbifold of all immersions @xmath22 of @xmath23 into @xmath24 modulo reparametrizations . in @xcite",

    "in particular , since burgers equation is related to the geodesic equation of the right invariant @xmath16-metric on @xmath27 , it implies that solutions of burgers equation are critical points of the length functional , but they are not length - minimizing .",
    "a similar result was shown for the kdv equation in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand it was shown in @xcite that for sobolev - type metrics on the diffeomorphism group of order one or higher the induced geodesic distance is positive .",
    "this naturally leads to the question whether one can determine the sobolev order where this change of behavior occurs .",

    "in this section we give definitions for sobolev norms of fractional orders and state the properties , which we will need later to prove the vanishing geodesic distance results .",

    "an equivalent norm is given by @xmath50 the fact that both norms are equivalent is based on the inequality @xmath51 holding for some constant @xmath52 . for @xmath53",
