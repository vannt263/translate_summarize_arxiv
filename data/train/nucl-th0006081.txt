    "a particular interest has been devoted during the last decade to the quantum algebra @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "they have the following commutation relations : @xmath5~=~\\pm~l_\\pm,\\ ] ] @xmath6~=~\\left[2~l_0\\right],\\ ] ] where the quantity in square brackets is defined as @xmath7~=~{q^n - q^{-n}\\over q - q^{-1}}.\\ ] ] in the most general case the deformation parameter @xmath0 is an arbitrary complex number and the physicist considers it as a phenomenological parameter @xcite . when @xmath8 , the quantum algebra @xmath2 , which defines a @xmath0-analogue of the angular momentum , reduces to the lie algebra @xmath9 of the ordinary angular momentum .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate @xmath0-analogues of dynamical systems and to look for new effects when @xmath10 .",
    "this has been first achieved for the harmonic oscillator by using algebraic methods , as e.g. in refs .",
    "taking , for example , @xmath11 with @xmath12 a real , positive quantity , one can find that the distance between subsequent levels of the @xmath0-harmonic oscillator decreases when the excitation increases .",
    "this is a desired property in describing rotational bands of deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "however the accidental degeneracy of the harmonic oscillator persists in this treatment .",
    "another , more appealing way to introduce @xmath0-analogues of simple dynamical systems , is through deriving a @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation . in this vein",
    "several attempts have been made for the harmonic oscillator , as for example in refs.@xcite , for an attractive coulomb potential @xcite or for both potentials @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to the removal of the accidental degeneracy whenever it exists .    here",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite where a @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation has been derived for a general central potential and the exact solution for the particular cases of the coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials have been obtained . the crucial starting point in ref .",
    "@xcite was the search for a hermitian realization of the position , momentum and angular momentum operators , all behaving as _ vectors _ with respect to @xmath2 algebra .",
    "this allowed the construction of an angular momentum operator entering the expression of the hamiltonian .",
    "its components are different from the generators of the @xmath2 algebra . in the case of central potentials ( spinless particles )",
    "the eigenfunctions of the @xmath0-deformed angular momentum have been derived as @xmath0-deformed spherical harmonics and then closed expressions for the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation have obtained as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this study is devoted to the derivation of a @xmath0-deformed spin - orbit coupling , consistent with the approach of ref .",
    "there an angular momentum @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) has been defined as a @xmath0-_vector _ with respect to the @xmath2 algebra ( [ def1])-([def2 ] ) . by analogy , here we introduce a spin operator @xmath15 which is a @xmath0-_vector _ in the algebra of @xmath16 analogue to ( [ def1])-([def2 ] ) .",
    "next a hermitian spin operator @xmath17 is constructed as a @xmath0-_vector _ in the coproduct algebra of the total angular momentum @xmath18 by using a unitary version of the universal @xmath19 matrix .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is defined as a @xmath0-scalar hermitian operator in the space of @xmath18 and its matrix elements are calculated exactly for the representations @xmath1 .    in previous applications of the @xmath0-deformed algebras to physical systems , as for example ref .",
    "@xcite , the spin - orbit coupling is derived in a different way , based on a boson realization of the @xmath20 algebra @xcite . there",
    "the spin operator does not form a vector in the coproduct algebra . accordingly",
    "the eigenvalues of the spin - orbit operator are different from ours .    in the next section",
    "we summarize the findings of ref . @xcite . in section",
    "iii a @xmath0-analogue of the spin - orbit coupling is derived . in section",
    "iv we calculate numerically the spectra of the @xmath0-harmonic oscillator and the @xmath0-coulomb potentials without and with a spin - orbit contribution .",
    "physical implications are discussed .",
    "we stress that we do not aim at a particular fit of the deformation parameter to describe some particular system but at modelling physical systems through @xmath2 algebra .",
    "the last section is devoted to some closing remarks .",
    "in this section we follow closely ref .",
    "the hamiltonian entering the @xmath0-deformed schrdinger equation is @xmath21 here and in the following we shall take @xmath22 the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian are @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the normalized @xmath0-spherical harmonics ( 56 ) and ( 57 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , depending of the deformation parameter @xmath0 and @xmath25 .",
    "they are related to @xmath0-hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath26 satisfies the following radial equation @xmath27 + v_0(r)\\right\\ } r^lu_l(r ) = e_{n\\ell}~r^lu_l(r)~,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the non - negative solution of @xmath29}{\\left[2\\right ] } \\frac{\\left[2 \\ell + 2\\right]}{\\left[2\\right ] } + c_{\\ell}^2 - c_{\\ell}~,\\ ] ] with @xmath30}~.\\ ] ] it then follows that for the coulomb potential @xmath31 the eigenvalue is @xmath32 and for the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath33 the eigenvalue is @xmath34 @xmath35 being in both cases the radial quantum number .    the spectrum is degenerate with respect to the magnetic quantum number @xmath36 but the accidental degeneracy typical for the undeformed equation is removed both for the coulomb and the harmonic oscillator potentials when @xmath10 .    from eq .",
    "( [ cl ] ) it follows that for @xmath37 one has @xmath38 .",
    "thus for @xmath37 the only non - negative solution of ( [ llplus1 ] ) is @xmath39 , for all deformations . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath37 levels are independent of the deformation parameter both for the harmonic oscillator and the coulomb potentials .",
    "the centrifugal barrier disappears and taking @xmath40 one reobtains the free particle case , as for undeformed equations .    for @xmath41",
    "it is useful to distinguish between two different types of deformation parameter :    @xmath42    in this case one can easily prove that @xmath43 so that eq .",
    "( [ llplus1 ] ) has real solutions .",
    "therefore to each non - zero @xmath44 corresponds a positive @xmath28 which is no more an integer .",
    "we found it interesting to use real @xmath0 for the coulomb potential , as shown in sec .",
    "the other case is : @xmath45 in this case for small values of @xmath12 one can find numerically that real positive values of @xmath28 exist .",
    "this case is applicable to the harmonic oscillator potential , because it leads to interesting analogies of its spectrum with a known case in nuclear physics , as discussed in sec .",
    "now the hamiltonian ( 4 ) contains a potential of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the central potential from the previous section , @xmath48 the spin - orbit operator and @xmath49 a function which vanishes when @xmath50 . in atomic or nuclear physics the spin - orbit operator is the ordinary scalar product between the spin and angular momentum . in the deformed case considered here we aim at introducing a similar definition .",
    "however there are inherent differences due to the more complex nature of the q - deformed vector operators , as explained below .",
    "by analogy to the q - angular momentum @xmath51 one can define a spin operator @xmath16 through relations similar to ( 1 - 3 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath51 and @xmath16 satisfy the hermiticity relations @xmath52 however the situation is different from the @xmath9 case because neither @xmath51 nor @xmath16 form a vector with respect to their @xmath2 algebra . in a @xmath2 algebra a q - vector of components @xmath53 , is defined through the relations @xcite @xmath54}v_{i\\pm1}\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ l_0,v_i]=iv_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where one takes @xmath55 = 0 whenever it appears .",

    "the generators @xmath62 of this algebra are defined as @xmath63 @xmath64 one can directly prove that they satisfy commutation relations of type ( [ def1 ] ) and ( [ def2 ] ) .",
    "one can also prove that @xmath56 are the components of a vector in the coproduct algebra which means that they satisfy relations analogous to ( [ r4 ] ) with @xmath62 instead of @xmath65 .",

    "however , instead of @xmath15 one can introduce another vector @xmath66 satisfying relations of type ( [ r4 ] ) with @xmath62 instead of @xmath65 .",
    "this can be achieved by using the universal @xmath19 matrix .",
    "in fact we need both the @xmath19 matrix and its conjugate @xcite .",

    "one can make use of the unitary matrix @xmath81 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a normalization factor",
    ". with the help of @xmath81 one can define the vector @xmath84 the components of which are hermitian operators , i.e. satisfy the relation @xmath85 now we can define a hermitian spin - orbit operator as @xmath86 where the scalar product between the @xmath0-vectors @xmath87 and @xmath88 is defined as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath89 with an implied summation over @xmath79 . using ( [ r15 ] )",
    "one can rewrite ( [ r18 ] ) as @xmath90 let us consider the first term in the right hand side of ( [ r19 ] ) where @xmath81 is replaced by its definition ( [ r17 ] ) @xmath91 here we look for example at the term @xmath92 which can be rewritten by inserting the identity @xmath93 in front of @xmath94 and also using the property @xmath95 this gives @xmath96 in a similar way the other term of ( [ r22 ] ) becomes @xmath97 where we have used @xmath98 and @xmath99 thus @xmath100.\\ ] ] one can see that in the above relation the vectors @xmath101 and @xmath88 are next to each other as it should be in a @xmath0-scalar product . for the second term of ( [ r19 ] ) we have @xmath102 or using @xmath103 in the manner explained above , we get @xmath104.\\ ] ]",

    "for example in the case of @xmath110 we have @xmath111 where after the second equality sign alternative forms of eqs .",

    "we can obtain the expectation value of @xmath48 for states of total angular momentum @xmath112 by calculating the expectation values of the scalars ( [ scalars ] ) .",
    "the simplest way is to use the state of maximum weight with @xmath113 . for @xmath114",

    "in fig . 1 we represent the eigenvalues ( [ coul ] ) of the coulomb potential as a function of @xmath12 ( real ) , when @xmath136 ( eq . ( [ qreal ] ) ) .",
    "one can see that every @xmath137 increases with @xmath12 when @xmath41 , the reason being that one has @xmath138 when one chooses @xmath0 to be real .",

    "in fact as long as @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the charge and @xmath49 the fine structure constant the expansion of the eigenvalues of the herbst equation coincides with that of the klein - gordon equation @xcite . thus the results shown in fig .",
    "1 suggest that the splitting found for @xmath10 can simulate relativistic kinematic effect .    in fig .",
    "2 the eigenvalues ( [ ho ] ) of the harmonic oscillator potential are plotted as a function of @xmath12 , where @xmath12 and the deformation parameter are related by eq .",

    "this choice is based on the fact that it implies @xmath144 so that in the interval @xmath145 the @xmath0-deformed spectrum satisfies inequalities as @xmath146 which correspond to a potential the form of which is between a harmonic oscillator and a square well potential . in nuclear physics",

    "we therefore see that the energies increase with increasing @xmath157 for fixed @xmath44 and increasing @xmath35 or @xmath44 for fixed @xmath157 .",
    "such a pattern corresponds to solutions of the dirac equation for a coulomb potential plus a perturbation which removes the two - fold degeneracy of the eigenvalues for a coulomb field . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that for a dirac particle moving in a purely attractive potential the level sequence is @xmath158 @xmath159 which is here the case when @xmath160 for the first and when @xmath161 for both rows of inequalities respectively .",
    "such sequences are expected for alkaline atoms .    in a similar way we add the spin - orbit coupling ( [ eplus ] ) and ( [ eminus ] ) to @xmath162 of eq .",

    "4 is similar to that of the neutron single particle spectrum ( see e.g. figs . 2 - 30 of ref .",
