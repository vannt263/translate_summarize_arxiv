    "for the simulation of the propagation of a monochromatic laser beam in a medium where the local refractive index is nearby a constant , it is classical to use the paraxial approximation of the maxwell equations .",
    "this approximation takes into account diffraction and refraction phenomena ; it is intensively used for decades in optics and in a lot of models related to laser - plasma interaction in inertial confinement fusion experiments ( cf @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the bibliography of these references ) .",
    "let us first recall briefly the outlines of this approximation . denote by @xmath0 the laser wave - length , it is in the order of 1 @xmath1 and is very small compared to the characteristic length of the simulation domain ( which is in the order of some @xmath2 for the inertial confinement plasmas ) . according to laws of optics ,",
    "the laser electromagnetic field may be modeled by the solution @xmath3 of the following helmholtz equation ( which comes from the time envelope of the full maxwell equations ) : @xmath4where we have denoted : @xmath5so @xmath6 is a complex function , its real part @xmath7 corresponds to a conveniently scaled absorption coefficient and its imaginary part @xmath8 to the variation of the refractive index ( @xmath9 is equal to the square of the refractive index @xmath10 up to a multiplicative constant ) .",
    "we assume also that the light propagates according a fixed direction defined by the unit vector @xmath11 after making the classical wkb expansion : @xmath12equation ( [ base ] ) may read as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the laplace operator with respect to the transverse variable : @xmath15,\\quad \\mathbf{1}\\hbox { being the unit   diagonal   tensor.}\\]]assuming that @xmath16 is slowly varying with respect to the longitudinal variable , we can neglect the right hand side of the previous equation .",
    "therefore @xmath16 satisfies the classical paraxial equation for wave propagation : @xmath17    for this kind of model , it is usual to handle a simulation box which is a parallelepiped and the laser beam is assumed to enter into the simulation box on a plane boundary denoted by @xmath18 let us denote @xmath19 the outward normal vector to the incoming boundary @xmath18 classically , the crucial assumption is that the laser beam enters into the simulation domain with a very small incidence angle , that is to say the vector @xmath20 is almost equal to @xmath21 .",
    "then , in such a framework , ( [ bbb ] ) is a classical linear schrdinger equation , the operator @xmath22 plays the part of time derivative and the boundary condition on @xmath23 which reads @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is a given function defined on @xmath23 ) plays the part of the initial condition . on the other hand ,",
    "artificial absorbing boundary conditions are to be imposed on the faces of the simulation domain parallel to the vector @xmath26 ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical methods are always implemented on an orthogonal mesh and are based on a splitting with respect to the main spatial variable between the diffraction part @xmath27 and refraction part @xmath28 see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example .",
    "we address in this paper a different case where the incidence angle of @xmath20 with @xmath21 is large ; these simulations are called tilted frame simulations .",
    "this kind of simulations is of particular interest if one has to deal with the crossing between two beams ( in the high energy laser devices , a large number of beams are focused on the target , therefore beam crossing may be taken into account , see @xcite for a survey on related laser propagation problems ) ; an example of such simulations in a very simplified case may be found on figure [ beau ] .",
    "this tilted frame model has been considered some years ago by physicists for dealing with beam crossing problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "simulations in a tilted frame are also necessary for dealing with special situations .",
    "for instance for the propagation of a beam in a domain where the profile of the refractive index @xmath10 is such that @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 constant smaller than 1 ) in a first subdomain @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 $ ] depends on a one - dimension variable @xmath34 and @xmath35 is small with respect to @xmath36 ) in a second juxtaposed subdomain @xmath37 , one must handle the paraxial equation ( [ bbb ] ) in subdomain @xmath31 and the helmholtz equation ( [ base ] ) in subdomain @xmath37 .",
    "for the numerical solution of ( [ base ] ) , one has to solve a huge linear system ( corresponding to the discretization of the equation on a very fine grid ) and for handling this huge linear system , it is necessary that the variable @xmath34 corresponds to one of the main direction of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore the full simulation on @xmath38 has to be performed in a box such that the corresponding normal vector @xmath19 must be parallel to @xmath39 ( see @xcite for details for this kind of simulations ) .    in the case of a large incidence angle",
    ", the crude expansion @xmath40 leads to difficulties and to overcome these difficulties , it has been proposed in @xcite to replace the transverse laplacian by a pseudodifferential operator , but with this approximation , @xmath41 is not slowly varying with respect to the spatial coordinates therefore it is necessary to handle very fine mesh -at least 10 cells per wave length- to get accurate results .",
    "one can also refer to the works in the spirit of @xcite in the acoustic framework but the application to the optics problems seems to be difficult .",
    "here we consider the expansion @xmath42 with @xmath16 slowly varying with respect to @xmath43 so we have to deal with the tilted frame laplace operator @xmath14 and one has to supplement the equation ( [ bbb ] ) with a right incoming boundary condition on @xmath23 .",
    "for the statement of this boundary condition , one assumes that a fixed plane wave @xmath44 enters into the domain where @xmath25 is a given function of the variable which is orthogonal to @xmath11 now , for the helmholtz problem , the boundary condition is classical and may be written as @xmath45 then using ( [ aaa ] ) and an asymptotic expansion with respect to the small parameter @xmath46 , the corresponding boundary condition for equation ( [ bbb ] ) may read in a natural way as : @xmath47    where @xmath48 denotes the gradient orthogonal to @xmath11 see @xcite for a justification of the paraxial approximation in the special case we are dealing with .",
    "if one sets @xmath49 in 3d and @xmath50 in 2d , the entrance boundary @xmath23 corresponds in this paper to @xmath51 . in the sequel",
    "we consider a 2d problem but most of the ideas of this work may be extended to the 3d case .",
    "equation ( [ bbb ] ) may be recast as : @xmath52and up to our knowledge , the numerical solution of this kind of equations is novel ; the main difficulty is to handle correctly the tilted laplace operator @xmath53 . for the mathematical analysis of the problem ,",
    "one key result is the following ( cf .",
    "proposition 2 ) . on the half - space @xmath54",
    "if the coefficient @xmath55 is a positive real constant , after taking the fourier transform with respect to the @xmath56 variable , the problem  ( [ bbb])([cbord ] ) is equivalent to an ordinary differential equation with respect to the @xmath57 variable and it is possible to exhibit an analytical solution .",
    "this analytical formula is the convenient tool for numerical treatment of the diffraction part of ( [ bbb ] ) in the general case where @xmath55 is not constant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ section - demi-2 ] , after setting classical energy estimates for problem  ( [ bbb ] ) supplemented by ( [ cbord ] ) , we prove the above mentioned theoretical result .",
    "section  [ section - num ] is devoted to the description of the numerical scheme for solving problem ( [ bbb])([cbord ] ) ; it is based on a splitting method with respect to the spatial variable @xmath57 using fast fourier transforms on a first step ( for the diffraction part ) and a standard finite difference method on a second step ( for the advection and refraction part ) .    in section [ sec : tilted ] , we give the numerical results on the initial problem and for a model where the coefficient @xmath8 in ( [ bbb ] ) is replaced by @xmath58 corresponding to the autofocusing which occurs in the laser - plasma interaction ( see @xcite for instance ) . from a physical point of view , this term represents a variation of the plasma electronic density caused by the ponderomotrice force of the laser . in the last section we consider a more general model where the stationary problem ( [ bbb ] ) is replaced by a time dependent one which is coupled to a hydrodynamic system for a suitable modeling of the plasma behavior",
    "for reasons which will appear in the sequel , we assume in this section that @xmath59 we first study the problem where the simulation domain is the half - space : @xmath60 assuming that @xmath61 is a bounded function , we consider the following problem : @xmath62      let us first state the following classical estimate .    [ energie - demi ]    [ energie - demi - theo ] let @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath64 is a solution to problem ( [ bbbb ] ) ( [ ce0 ] ) , it is unique .",
    "moreover , we have the following stability estimate , with a constant @xmath65 independent of @xmath66 @xmath61 : @xmath67    let us denote @xmath68 .",
    "doing the scalar product of equation ( [ bbb ] ) with @xmath16 and taking its imaginary part , we get : @xmath69 according to the boundary condition ( [ ce0 ] ) we check that : @xmath70 then we get : @xmath71 according to ( [ sec ] ) , if @xmath72 we see that @xmath73)([ce0 ] ) .    to obtain the stability inequality",
    ", we first see that equation ( [ sec ] ) implies : @xmath74 using this estimate , equation ( [ sec ] ) leads to : @xmath75    by the same technique we get also the following estimate : @xmath76 which says that the absorbing energy plus the the outgoing energy is equal to the incoming energy .",
    "we now assume that @xmath77 and @xmath7 is constant for getting an analytical form of the solution to problem  ( [ bbb])([cbord ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath78 and @xmath79 the function defined by : @xmath80 the problem may read as : @xmath81 in the sequel , the fourier variables related to @xmath57 and @xmath56 respectively are @xmath82 and @xmath83 the fourier transform in @xmath57 and @xmath56 are denoted by @xmath84 and @xmath85 , moreover @xmath86 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath87 .    here and in the sequel , @xmath88 denotes the principal determination of the square root ( its real part is positive ) .",

    "let us define @xmath105 as the polynomial which characterizes the differential operator of the equation , that is to say : @xmath106 writing @xmath107 , the fourier transform in @xmath56 of the equation in @xmath99 reads : @xmath108 polynomial @xmath109 may be factorized as : @xmath110 where we define @xmath111 thus : @xmath112@xmath113 we now show that there is a unique acceptable solution for this ordinary differential equation .",

    "6 .   for the definition of the boundary layer @xmath324 given by ( [ eq : defb ] ) , we take @xmath325 and @xmath326    all our figures represent the laser energy @xmath258 .    to be easier to read , our examples are variations with respect to the case defined by the previous numerical values of the coefficients and computed with a cfl number @xmath327 equal to 1 ( see figure [ fig1-ref ] ) . with these assumptions , the scheme converges very well as the discretization step decreases ( see table [ tab : conv : ord1 ] ) .",
    "due to the @xmath179 coefficient , focusing occurs : the beam focuses and reaches a maximum , then decreases .",
    "notice that it may even focus several times for larger values of @xmath328 all our comparisons are made with this reference case , denoted @xmath329 in the fully converged situation ( with mesh size @xmath330 corresponding to @xmath331 points on a domain length @xmath332 )      * convergence of the first order scheme *",

    "a limit value of @xmath127 is experienced , above which no focusing phenomenon ( for the nonlinear equation ) is observed . in our reference case for instance ,",
    "the limit is around @xmath336 see figure [ fig : ep : lfoc ] , but this limit depends of course on all parameters , especially @xmath179 and @xmath337    from a physical point of view , all our asymptotic analysis is built on the assumption @xmath338 else , our equation is no more a valid approximation of the envelope of helmholtz equation , given by ( [ base ] ) .",
    "hence , we have to assume @xmath339 larger values are meaningless .",
    "@xmath335 * variation of @xmath328 *    the parameter @xmath179 represents a nonlinear effect , and induces autofocusing and filamentation of the beam .",
    "the larger it is , the more accurate the focusing phenomenon becomes , as illustrated in figure [ fig : alpha : max ]",
    ".    it could be interesting to evaluate the value of @xmath179 for which a focusing phenomenon appears : in our reference case , it is for @xmath340 . on the other hand , one may check that if @xmath179 is large enough , several focusing points appear and a breaking of the beam occurs ( see figure [ fig : alpha : increase : ray ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon depends of course also on the absorption coefficient @xmath128 and on the diffusion coefficient @xmath341      we wish to check now that there is no artificial damping due to the numerical scheme ; in other words , that in the second stage the decrease of the @xmath342 norm of the solution has the right value . using the notations of section [ subsec : scheme : prop ]",
    ", this right value is given by the equality : @xmath343 going back to equation ( [ eq : step2 ] ) , we can write it under the form ( assuming no artificial boundary layer : @xmath344 ) @xmath345 where we set @xmath346 and @xmath347 since the characteristic value of the coefficient @xmath348 is @xmath349 ( or smaller ) and , in the worst case , the characteristic value of @xmath61 is in the order of @xmath350 so that we can choose @xmath351 to have @xmath233 small , we see that @xmath352 which is very close to the right value @xmath353 the only damping may then come from the fact that @xmath354 may be significantly smaller than @xmath355 due to a large difference between @xmath356 and @xmath357 to check this numerically , we test the case @xmath358 figure [ fig : nonu : energy ] shows that even in a difficult case with a large @xmath359 the global energy @xmath360 is conserved .",
    "we have also performed computations for the two - ray model which is described above at section [ subsubsec:2ray ] using two functions @xmath361 and @xmath362 ; an illustration is given by figure [ fig:2rays ] .",
    "the interaction between the rays is only given by the nonlinear term @xmath363 with @xmath364 as above .",
    "to analyse its exact influence , one can compare the result given by the previous model with the two - ray interaction and the result given by a simple superposition of two independant rays ( obtained with the one - ray model ) .",
    "one may see then that the energy becomes larger with the two - ray interaction : on the case of figure [ fig:2rays ] for instance , @xmath365 instead of @xmath366 if the rays do not interact .",
    "we now address a model where a tilted paraxial equation is coupled with a hydrodynamic model in order to study filamentation . under the hypothesis of a small incidence angle , this model has been extensively used by physicists for a long time and it is also addressed in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite for example and the references therein ( for a derivation of this model , see @xcite for example ) .      *",
    "modeling of the plasma . *    by taking the critical density ( depending only on the laser wave length ) as a reference density , one defines a non - dimension electron density @xmath367 ; so the plasma may be characterized only by this quantity , the plasma velocity @xmath368 and the electron density @xmath369 .",
    "then , the simplest model is the following one .",
    "the pressure @xmath370 is assumed to be a smooth function of the density @xmath371 and of the electron temperature @xmath372 ( which is assumed to be a very smooth fixed function of the position @xmath373 ) , for example @xmath374 may be the sum of two terms equal to @xmath375 and @xmath376 up to multiplicative constants . then one considers the following barotropic euler system : @xmath377    the term @xmath378 corresponds to a ponderomotive force due to a laser pressure ( the coefficient @xmath379 is a constant depending only on the ion species ) .    *",
    "modeling of the laser beam . *",
    "the laser field @xmath380 is a solution to the following frequency wave equation ( which is of schrdinger type ) : @xmath381 where the real coefficient @xmath382 is related to the absorption of the laser intensity by the plasma and @xmath383 the light speed .",
    "assume that the mean value of the plasma density is quite constant and denoted @xmath384 , so we set : @xmath385 where @xmath386 is small with respect to @xmath387 then one can make the paraxial approximation ; that is to say the laser beam is now characterized by the space and time envelope of the electric field @xmath388 and we set : @xmath389 therefore , if one sets @xmath390 by the same procedure as mentioned in the introduction , one checks that @xmath391 satisfies : @xmath392    it is necessary to supplement equation ( [ parax ] ) with the same boundary condition as in the model of section 1 ( and with an initial condition ) .",
    "* numerical method . *    we consider a mesh of finite difference type as above .",
    "the numerical treatment of the barotropic euler system ( [ moli])([molii ] ) is a classical one , we have chosen a _",
    "lagrange - euler _ method , see @xcite for details . to deal with ( [ parax ] ) , according to the large value of the speed of light , one must perform a time inplicit discretization .",
    "so at each time step , one solves firstly the euler system with a ponderomotive force evaluated with the previous value of @xmath393 secondly , using the obtained values of @xmath371 and of @xmath394 one has to solve ( [ parax ] ) ; if @xmath395 and @xmath16 denote the values of the field @xmath391 at the beginning and the end of time step , one searches @xmath16 solution to : @xmath396 where we have set : @xmath397 that is exactly the equation studied in section 3 , but a right hand side term has been added .",
    "so the numerical method is the same as described above ; the only modification is the adding of the right hand side term in the transport stage .",
    "notice that the index of refraction @xmath398 is equal to @xmath399    > from a practical point of view , the numerical method for ( [ parax ] ) has been implemented in a parallel way in the _ hera _ plateform for plasma hydrodynamics in 2d and in 3d ; the parallel solver and the domain decomposition techniques are the same as the ones detailed in @xcite .      recall that from a practical point of view , in the transverse profile of a laser beam , one distinguishes a lot of small hot spots , called _",
    "speckles _ , whose intensity is very large compared to the mean intensity of the beam .",
    "the shape of each individual speckle is a gaussian function whose width is about a few micrometers .",
    "we present here the results of a 2d numerical simulation .",
    "one addresses a simulation box which is 600 @xmath61 m long and 300 @xmath61 m wide , the laser propagates with an incidence angle of @xmath400 the incoming boundary condition @xmath401 is independent of time and mimics a laser beam whose width is equal to @xmath402 with five speckles ; each speckle is modeled by a centered gaussian function @xmath403 and is characterized by a random phase @xmath404 , that is to say @xmath405 where the @xmath406 are random and the @xmath407 are close to each other .",
    "the plasma has an initial density equal to @xmath408 and the temperature is equal to @xmath409 kelvin .",
    "the mesh consists of 4 millions of cells and the time step is in the order of 0.1 picosecond ( it is determined at each time step by the courant - friedrichs - levy condition related to the sound speed of the plasma ) .",
    "the initial value of the laser intensity is zero , the plasma is progressively grabed by the ponderomotive force and on figure [ beau ] , we have plotted the laser intensity at different times . at the first snapshot ( at time @xmath410 ps ) , the plasma is not grabed enough , so the value of @xmath61 is small ; the autofocusing effect is very low but not negligible : instead of five different speckles at the incoming boundary one notices only four speckels at the rear side ( one of the four has a larger intensity ) and a little spreading of the beam may be observed . at the second snapshot ,",
    "the position of the four speckles has changed and the plasma is more grabed - since the energy density is larger in one speckle . on the two last snapshots , we may check that the spreading of the beam at the rear side of the simulation box becomes larger when the time increases .",

    "a mathematical analysis has lead to an analytical form of the solution of the tilted paraxial equation in the simple case where the refraction index and the absorption coefficients are constant .",
    "afterwards , we proposed a numerical method for solving the initial problem which uses the previous analytical form .",
    "the scheme has the property to yield a classical scheme when incidence angle becomes zero and the equation reduces to the classical paraxial one .",
    "the numerical method is illustrated by some results on toy problems .",
    "we have also given extensions of this model , which have enlarged the capability of our plateform _ hera _ for laser propagation in a plasma ( see @xcite and @xcite for examples of simulations performed with _",
    "this numerical method may be also extended in the case where the unit vector @xmath411 depends slowly on the one - dimension spatial variable @xmath412 , for instance if one has to deal with an equation of the following type @xmath413 the paraxial equation in a tilted frame may be also considered in a first region where the plasma density is slowly varying with respect to the spatial variable and coupled with another model in a neighbor region where the plasma density is strongly varying : in that region the laser is no more characterized by the time - space envelope of the fast oscillating electric field but by the wave equation ( [ wave ] ) ( see @xcite , for results obtained in _ hera _ with this model ) . for simulating such a physical tilted beam , a classical paraxial model without accounting for the incidence angle would lead to search a the solution which would be highly oscillating with respect to the space variable and therefore to increase dramatically the mesh size to get accurate results ."
