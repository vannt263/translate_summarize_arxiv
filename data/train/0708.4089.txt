    "the decay @xmath0 is dominated by the @xmath14 transition and can provide the important information associated with the charge higgs in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the @xmath15 lepton in the final state provide additional observables sensitive to the physics beyond sm , as well as the @xmath15 polarization , which can not be accessed in other semileptonic decays .",
    "however , the neutrinos in the final states and the low efficiencies from @xmath15 reconstruction make the search to be very challenging .",
    "the sm predict a @xmath16 branching fraction of 1.4%  @xcite , while there are several experimental results provided by the lep experiments ; the averaged @xmath17 semi - inclusive branching fraction is @xmath18%  @xcite .",
    "the flavor - changing neutral - current process @xmath1 is sensitive to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the sm branching fractions are estimated to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 decays  @xcite , respectively , and are expected to be much lower for other modes . theoretical calculation of the decay amplitudes for these decays is particularly reliable , because of the absence of long - distance interactions that affect charged - lepton channels @xmath23 .",
    "new physics such as susy particles or a possible fourth generation could potentially contribute to the penguin loop or box diagram and enhance the amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite also discusses the possibility of discovering light dark matter in @xmath24 transitions with large missing momentum . due to the challenge of cleanly detecting rare modes with two final - state neutrinos ,",
    "only a few studies of @xmath25 have been carried out to date  @xcite .    in this report , we present the first observation of the decay @xmath0 and the search for the decays @xmath1 ( @xmath2 stands for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ) using a 492 fb@xmath35 data sample recorded at the @xmath36 resonance , corresponding to @xmath37 @xmath38-meson pairs . throughout this report , the inclusion of charge conjugate decays is implied unless otherwise stated .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer located at the kekb collider  @xcite , and is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we select charged tracks that are associated with the interaction point ( ip ) .",
    "the electrons candidates are selected using the information from particle identification systems .",
    "the four momenta of electron candidates are corrected for bremsstrahlung radiation by adding photons within a 50 mrad cone along the track direction .",
    "the @xmath31 candidates are reconstructed from pairs of photon with the invariant mass in the range 118 mev/@xmath39 and 150 mev/@xmath39 .",
    "minimum energies of 60120 mev are required for the photon canidates from @xmath31 decays , according to different polar angles .",
    "photons that are not included in @xmath40 reconstruction and exceed a polar - angle dependent energy threshold ( 100200 mev ) are included in the tag - side @xmath38-meson ( @xmath41 ) reconstruction .",
    "reconstruction of the @xmath41 strongly suppresses the combinatorial and continuum backgrounds and provides kinematical constraints on the signal meson ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we take the advantage of the clean signature , supported by the @xmath43 meson at the signal side .",
    "the @xmath41 meson is reconstructed using all the particles that remain after selecting candidates for @xmath42 decay daughters .",
    "the @xmath43 mesons are reconstructed through the following decay chain : @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath15 leptons are reconstructed in @xmath47 and @xmath48 decays , while the @xmath49 mode is excluded due to the inefficient muon identification in the relevant momentum range . for @xmath50 decays ,",
    "only @xmath45 mode is used in order to avoid the higher combinatorial background .",
    "once a @xmath51 candidate is reconstructed and a charged track expected from @xmath52 is selected , the remaining particles measured by the detector are used to reconstruct the @xmath41 .",
    "two kinematical variables , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , are used to identify the @xmath41 candidates , where @xmath55 is the beam energy .",
    "the momentum ( @xmath56 ) and energy ( @xmath57 ) of the @xmath41 meson is calculated by a summation over all particles that are not assigned to @xmath42 .",
    "the signal candidates are required to satisfiy @xmath58 gev/@xmath39 and @xmath59 gev at least . to improve the purity of the selected @xmath41 candidates ,",
    "several additional requirements are imposed , such as zero total event charge , no additional leptons in the event , zero bayron number .",
    "the residual energy in the ecl should be smaller than 0.35 gev and number of neutral particles ( @xmath31 and @xmath60 ) included for the tag side should be less then 5 .",
    "the @xmath41 reconstruction algorithm is varified using the control sample , @xmath61 , and is found to be consistent with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "the dominated background source is from the semileptonic @xmath62 decays for @xmath63 mode , and combinatorial background from hadonic @xmath38 decays for @xmath50 decays .",
    "further background suppression is achieved with the following variables : the missing energy @xmath64 , visible energy of the event , the square of missing mass @xmath65 , and the effective mass of @xmath66 system @xmath67 .",
    "the most effective variable @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 , which is closely related to the missing mass but does not depend on @xmath41 reconstruction .",
    "we extract the signal yields by maximum likelihood fits to the @xmath70 distributions .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xmath71~,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the probability density function ( pdf ) for signal and combinatorial background events , and @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 denote the yields for signal , pecking background , and combinatorial background , respectively .",
    "the signal distribution is described using a crystal ball lineshape function  @xcite , and the background part is parameterized using the argus - function  @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath74 and @xmath76 are float parameters in the fit , while the @xmath75 is fixed to the value obtained from mc simulation , and fixed to zero for @xmath50 decays .",
    "the fit results are included in table  [ tab : dtaunu ] , and the distributions of @xmath70 and @xmath77 from data with fit results superimposed are shown in figure  [ fig : dtaunu ] .",
