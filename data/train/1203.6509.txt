    "the left - hand side of is a _ character _ , a fundamental object in the _ representation theory_. in this section we will briefly review this theory .      roughly speaking",
    ", the subject of the representation theory is the investigation of the ways in which a given abstract group can be realized concretely as a group of matrices .",
    "before we give a formal definition let us have a look on a simple example .",
    "the _ symmetric group _",
    "@xmath3 is the group of permutations of the set @xmath4 .",
    "if we label the vertices of an equilateral triangle by the elements of this set ( figure [ fig : triangle ] ) , any element of @xmath3 gives rise to a symmetry of the triangle , thus to an isometry of the plane .",
    "if the coordinate system is chosen properly , these isometries are linear and thus described by @xmath5 matrices .",
    "we can say ( abusing a bit the terminology ) that we represented the symmetric group @xmath3 as certain @xmath5 matrices .    formally , a _ representation _ of a group @xmath6 is a homomorphism @xmath7 which to the elements of the group associates invertible matrices .",
    "the above example was too simple ; we will now present a less obvious one .",
    "it is possible to inscribe a cube into the regular dodecahedron in such a way that each vertex of the cube is also a vertex of the dodecahedron ( figure [ fig : dodecahedron ] ) . for a fixed dodecahedron",
    "there are five such cubes .",
    "thus to any rotation of the dodecahedron corresponds a permutation of the cubes .",
    "this permutation is even or , in other words , belongs to the _ alternating group _ @xmath8 and this correspondence is bijective .",
    "we can revert the optics : to any element of the alternating group @xmath8 we associate the corresponding rotation of the dodecahedron .",
    "if the coordinate system is chosen properly , this rotation is a linear isometry . in this way we constructed an interesting representation of the alternating group @xmath8 .",
    "as we already mentioned , the representation theory studies the ways a given abstract group can be represented concretely as a group of matrices . in this way we can use the power of linear algebra in order to study problems from the group theory .",
    "another motivation comes from harmonic analysis .",
    "one of the most powerful tools for analysis and probability on the real line @xmath9 is the fourier transform .",
    "if we would like to replace the real line @xmath9 by the finite cyclic group @xmath10 one should simply use the discrete fourier transform instead .",
    "it is less obvious how to define the fourier transform on a _ non - commutative _ finite group @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that representations of the group @xmath6 are the right tool to define such an analogue .",
    "if we view a representation @xmath11 as a matrix - valued function , its values depend on the choice of the coordinate system in the vector space . sometimes it would be preferable to have some quantities which do not depend on such choices .",
    "one of such quantities is the _ trace _ of a matrix .",
    "this motivates the study of the _ character _ of @xmath12 @xmath13 which is a scalar - valued function on the group @xmath6 .",
    "a significant part of the representation theory is devoted to investigation of such characters . at first sight",
    "it might appear that changing the focus from representations to characters might cause some loss of information because a matrix contains much more data than just its trace .",
    "surprisingly , it is not the case as almost all natural questions of the representation theory can be reformulated in the language of characters .",
    "the left - hand side of our guiding formula is such a character ( up to some normalizing factors which will be discussed later ) .",
    "the right - hand side of our favorite equality describes the _ shape _ of a _ young diagram_. this section is devoted to this concept .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are representations of the same group @xmath6 , we can define a new representation of @xmath6 , called _ direct sum _",
    "@xmath16 which is given by the block matrices @xmath17 representations which can be written ( possibly after change of the coordinate system ) as direct sums of smaller representations are called _ reducible _ and are less interesting .",
    "our attention will concentrate on representations for which such a decomposition is not possible ; they are called _",
    "irreducible representations _ and play a fundamental role in the representation theory ( for example they are used in the construction of the non - commutative fourier transform ) .",
    "the corresponding characters are called _ irreducible characters _ and they are in the focus of this article .      there is a bijection between irreducible representations of the symmetric group @xmath0 and _ young diagrams _ with @xmath1 boxes .",
    "the latter are collections of boxes which are nicely aligned to the left and to the bottom ( figure [ fig : younga ] ) . for a young diagram @xmath18",
    "we will denote the corresponding irreducible representation by @xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately , the details of this bijection are technically involved . in order to give the flavor of this difficulty we mention only that one of the irreducible representations of the symmetric group @xmath20 is closely related to the not - so - trivial representation of its subgroup @xmath21 which we discussed in section [ subsec : dodecahedron ] .",
    "_ what can we say about the irreducible representations of the symmetric groups when the corresponding young diagrams tend infinity , having a fixed ` macroscopic shape ' ? _ in order to make this question more concrete , we will use the notion of _",
    "dilation_. if @xmath22 is a positive integer and @xmath18 is a young diagram we will denote by @xmath23 the _ dilated young diagram _ , obtained from @xmath18 by replacing each box by a @xmath24 grid of boxes ( figure [ fig : youngb ] ) .",
    "if we disregard the size , such a dilated young diagram has the same _ shape _ as the original diagram ( compare figures [ fig : younga ] and [ fig : youngb ] ) .",
    "our original question can be therefore reformulated as investigation of the dilated young diagrams @xmath23 , where @xmath18 is fixed and @xmath25 .      for this kind of asymptotic problems",
    "we need the right tools : functions on the set of young diagrams which would depend _ ` nicely ' _ on the shape of the young diagram .",
    "for example we could require from such a nice function @xmath26 that it depends only on the shape of the young diagram and not on its size : @xmath27 .",
    "this requirement is too strong ; it would not be a big problem if we allow a simple dependence of @xmath26 on the the size of the young diagram : @xmath28 for some exponent @xmath29 .",
    "if this is the case we say that @xmath26 is _ homogeneous _ of degree @xmath29 .",
    "our favorite formula gives a relationship between the irreducible characters of the symmetric groups and the shape of the young diagram . in this section",
    "we will investigate this kind of relationships .",

    "for example , the dimension of the irreducible representation @xmath19 is equal to the number of _ young tableaux _ filling @xmath18 .",
    "a young tableau is a filling of the boxes of the young diagram @xmath18 with numbers @xmath130 ( where @xmath1 is the number of boxes of @xmath18 ) in such a way that each number is used exactly once and the numbers increase from left to right and from bottom to top ( figure [ fig : tableau ] ) .",
    "investigation of algorithms with a similar flavor is a one of important branches of combinatorics .",
    "in particular , irreducible characters of the symmetric groups @xmath131 can be calculated using such a combinatorial algorithm , the _ murnaghan - nakayama rule _ which is a signed sum over , roughly speaking , young tableaux filling @xmath18 with some additional properties ( related to the conjugacy class of the permutation @xmath132 ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is a common feature of such combinatorial algorithms that they quickly become cumbersome when the number of the boxes of the young diagram tends to infinity .",
    "for this reason they are not very suitable for the investigation of the asymptotics problems .",
    "in particular , murnaghan - nakayama rule does not give too much insight into our favorite question  the answer to which is given by our guiding equality  about the relationship between the characters and the shape of the young diagram . in order to overcome these difficulties",
    "we will have to find a better normalization of the characters as well as find a good way of describing the shape of a young diagram .",
    "the left - hand side of our favorite equality is the _ normalized character_. in this section we will present the details of this quantity .",
    "the usual way of studying the characters of the symmetric groups is to fix the young diagram @xmath18 and to view @xmath133 as a function of the permutation @xmath132 .",
    "it was a brilliant idea of kerov and olshanski to do the opposite and to study the _ dual combinatorics _ of representations of the symmetric groups , see below .    for a fixed integer @xmath134",
    "we will denote by @xmath135=(1,2,\\dots , k)\\in { \\mathfrak{s}(k)}$ ] the full cycle ; we will investigate the characters evaluated on the permutation @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath18 be a young diagram with @xmath1 boxes ; we are interested in the character @xmath136).\\ ] ] it might seem that this quantity does not make much sense since @xmath135 $ ] belongs to @xmath137 while @xmath19 is a representation of a different group , namely @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath138 we can consider an embedding @xmath139 and regard @xmath135 $ ] as an element of @xmath0 simply by adding additional fixpoints .",
    "it turns out that the ` right ' way to define the _ normalized character _ on a cycle of length @xmath29 is as follows : @xmath140)}{\\operatorname{tr}\\rho^\\lambda(e)},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the number of boxes of @xmath18 .",
    "as we already mentioned , we will view the normalized character @xmath141 as a function on the set of young diagrams and _ we impose no restrictions on the number of boxes of the young diagrams_.    the normalization factor in the above definition is equal to zero if @xmath142 ; in this way the right - hand side is equal to zero and we do not have to worry that @xmath143)$ ] is not well - defined in this case .",
    "the denominator @xmath144 , the character on the group unit , is equal just to the dimension of the representation @xmath19 and there are some effective methods of calculating it .",
    "this means that the normalized characters @xmath141 contain essentially the same information as the usual characters @xmath133 thus they are just as interesting .",
    "on the other hand the normalized characters @xmath141 have some advantages over the usual characters @xmath133 , for example @xmath145 is a polynomial function of the lengths of the rows of the young diagram @xmath146 .",
    "the right - hand side of our favorite formula concerns the shape of the young diagram .",
    "the question is : _ how to choose parameters which would describe the shape of the young diagram in the best way ? _ the answer comes from voiculescu s _ free probability _ theory .",
    "voiculescu initiated a highly non - commutative probability theory called _",
    "free probability_. one of its highlights is related to _",
    "random matrices_. we consider the following concrete problem .",
    "let @xmath147 be an @xmath148 random matrix , selected uniformly from the manifold of all hermitian matrices with prescribed eigenvalues @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 ; _ what can we say about the eigenvalues of the @xmath151 upper - left corner _",
    "@xmath152 in the limit as @xmath153 and @xmath154 converges to some limit , a kind of law of large numbers occurs and these eigenvalues with high probability concentrate around some limit distribution depending only on the distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath149 of the big matrix . as an illustration",
    ", we present the results of a computer experiment for a large matrix @xmath155 with eigenvalues @xmath156 ( each with some high multiplicity which will be discussed later ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of the corner matrix @xmath157 are shown as ` plus ' markers on the @xmath158-axis on figure [ figure : law - of - large ] .",
    "some of these eigenvalues are degenerate and coincide with the three eigenvalues of the original matrix ( thick markers ) .",
    "the remaining eigenvalues occupy two intervals : one around @xmath159 and one around @xmath109 , the empirical density of these eigenvalues turns out to be quite close to the asymptotic value for @xmath153 .",

    "the fact that our random matrix @xmath155 has a large symmetry implies that this corner entry @xmath163 contains essentially all information about @xmath155 which is necessary for asymptotic problems .",
    "the free cumulants @xmath164 of the random matrix @xmath155 ( with @xmath165 ) are defined as suitably normalized coefficients in the expansion @xmath166 the normalization was chosen in such a way that the free cumulants converge to finite values as @xmath153 .",
    "free cumulants contain the same information as the eigenvalues of the matrix but they are much more convenient for asymptotic problems .",
    "for example , the solution to the our problem of the eigenvalues of the corner @xmath157 is given by @xmath167 which is a direct consequence of the above definition of free cumulants .",
    "it was observed by biane that to an irreducible representation @xmath19 of a symmetric group one can associate a certain large matrix @xmath168 which contains all information about @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix are nicely related to the shape of the young diagram : the @xmath158-coordinates ( defined as @xmath169 ) of the concave corners of the young diagram ( indicated by the diagonal gray lines on figure [ fig : younga ] ) are the eigenvalues of this matrix .",
    "for example , the matrix @xmath168 associated to the young diagram from figure [ fig : younga ] has eigenvalues : @xmath170 , @xmath161 , @xmath32 ( each with some high multiplicity ) . in particular , the eigenvalues of @xmath171 and of @xmath172",
    "are related to each other by a simple scaling by factor @xmath22 ; compare figures [ fig : younga ] and [ fig : youngb ] .",
    "biane defined the free cumulants of the young diagram @xmath18 @xmath173 as free cumulants of the corresponding matrix @xmath168 .",
    "the free cumulant @xmath174 is a homogeneous function of degree @xmath29 on the set of young diagrams : @xmath175 in other words free cumulants are examples of the ` nice ' functions which we were looking for in section [ subsec : homogeneous ] . from our perspective we can forget that free cumulants of young diagrams have this long and interesting history related to random matrices and simply treat them as convenient parameters describing the shape of the young diagram and which can be calculated efficiently .",

    "homogeneity of free cumulants implies that @xmath183 in the limit @xmath25 only the top - degree part really matters , therefore we can informally write @xmath184 .",
    "it was shown by biane that it is a general phenomenon : the value of the ( normalized ) irreducible character on the cycle @xmath135 $ ] is ( asymptotically , for large young diagrams ) given by the free cumulant @xmath185 of the young diagram : @xmath186 the left - hand side is the quantity which we wanted to understand because it is so fundamental for the representation theory ; the right - hand side can be efficiently calculated from the shape of the young diagram .",
    "this is a beautiful result and we will present one of its applications below .      let us randomly select a young tableau filling prescribed young diagram @xmath18 with @xmath1 boxes and let us remove boxes with numbers bigger than some prescribed threshold @xmath187 ( figure [ fig : tableau ] ) .",
    "_ what can we say about the shape of the resulting smaller young diagram @xmath188 ? _ the results of computer experiments ( figure [ figure : law - of - large ] ) suggest that with high probability these new young diagrams asymptotically concentrate around some smooth limiting shapes .",
    "this problem can be reformulated in the language of the representation theory : @xmath19 is a representation of @xmath0 ; we consider its restriction @xmath189 to the subgroup @xmath190 .",
    "this restriction is usually a reducible representation ; we decompose it into irreducible components and randomly select one of them , say @xmath191 .",
    "the distribution of the resulting random young diagram @xmath188 has the same distribution as in the original problem .    for large young diagrams @xmath18 and",

    "this is illustrated on figure [ figure : law - of - large ] : the diagonal lines indicate the @xmath158-coordinates of the concave corners of the young diagram @xmath188 drawn with a thick line while the ` plus ' markers indicate eigenvalues of a corner of a large random matrix @xmath155 with the same eigenvalues as @xmath168 .",
    "the parallelism between and implies that ( asymptotically ) the density of the eigenvalues of the corner matrix @xmath157 should match the density of eigenvalues of @xmath194 and thus the @xmath158-coordinates of the concave corners of the diagram @xmath188 .",

    "an embedding is a function which maps white vertices to columns of @xmath18 , black vertices to rows of @xmath18 , edges to boxes of @xmath18 .",
    "we also require that an embedding preserves the incidence , i.e.  a vertex @xmath208 and an incident edge @xmath209 should be mapped to a row or column @xmath210 which contains the box @xmath211 .",
    "stanley s formula is a perfect tool for studying asymptotics of characters of symmetric groups in various scalings .",
    "it was also the tool which was essential in the proof of kerov positivity conjecture ( which will be discussed below ) .",
    "the function @xmath212 is homogeneous which explains why stanley s formula is a perfect tool for our purposes .",
    "the degree of this homogeneous function @xmath213 is directly related to the _ genus _ of the surface on which map @xmath206 is drawn .",
    "thus the _ planar maps _ ( which can be drawn on the sphere , genus equal to zero ) have maximal possible degree and asymptotically have the biggest contribution .",
    "this kind of _ genus expansion _ where to combinatorial summands one can associate a surface which determines the asymptotics is very common in the asymptotic representation theory as well as in the random matrix theory .",
    "genus expansion and , in particular , the special role of planar maps explains why combinatorics of free cumulants ( originally formulated by speicher in terms of _ non - crossing partitions _ which are set partitions that can be drawn on a sphere ) is so useful .",
    "the coefficient standing at monomial @xmath214 in kerov polynomial @xmath141 turns out to be the number of maps with @xmath29 edges with black vertices decorated by @xmath215 ( figure [ fig : map - kerov ] ) such that the following _ transportation problem _ has a solution .",
    "we imagine that each white vertex is a factory producing a unit of some liquid , each black vertex decorated by @xmath216 is a consumer demanding @xmath217 units of this liquid and the edges of the map are one - way pipes which can transport the liquid only from white to black vertices .",
    "we require that it is possible to arrange the amount of the liquid in each pipe in such a way that _ each pipe transports a strictly positive amount_. the map on figure [ fig : map - kerov ] fulfills this condition .",
    "the fact that we require a _ strictly _ positive solution is quite unusual for such transportation problems and has some interesting consequences .",
    "firstly , the classical criterion ( given by _ hall s marriage theorem _ ) for checking whether such a transportation problem has a solution has to be changed .",
    "secondly , this _ strict positivity _",
    "requirement restricts the maps which could contribute to the coefficients of kerov polynomials , namely such a map can not contain a disconnecting edge except for edges leading to white leaves ( figure [ fig : map - kerov ] ) .",
    "this is quite a strong restriction ; for example the number of such maps with a fixed genus grows only polynomially with the size of the map while the number of all maps with fixed genus grows exponentially .",
    "this implies that the coefficients of kerov polynomials for @xmath141 corresponding to fixed genus grow relatively slowly ( polynomially ) with @xmath29 .",
    "it should be compared with analogues of kerov polynomials in which instead of free cumulants we use some other quantities describing the shape of the young diagram ; in the latter case the growth of the integer coefficients with @xmath29 is usually exponential .",
    "this is an indication that kerov polynomials contain relatively small amount of information , they have small complexity and thus free cumulants are _ the right _ quantities for studying asymptotics of characters .      the definition of the normalized characters can be easily adapted to more complicated conjugacy classes ; for example we denote by @xmath218 the normalized character on a pair of cycles of lengths @xmath29 and @xmath219 .",
    "following our guide we can write an analogue of kerov polynomials , for example @xmath220 as one can see , the analogue of kerov s positivity conjecture does not hold true . this is an indication that _ characters @xmath221 are not the right quantities_.    it turns out that it is much better to study a kind of _ covariance _ @xmath222 which measures how the character on two disjoint cycles differs from the product of the characters on each cycle separately .",
    "one can consider the corresponding kerov polynomials , for example @xmath223 apart from the global change of the sign all coefficients are again non - negative integers which is an indication that _ such a covariance is the right quantity_. indeed , the combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of kerov polynomials from section [ subsec : kerov - interpretation ] holds true after some simple adjustments , including the requirement that we consider only _ connected _ maps ( for unicellular maps this was automatic ) .    a degree of a function @xmath224 on young diagrams is defined as the degree of the polynomial @xmath225 .",
    "the _ connectivity _ requirement in the combinatorial interpretation of kerov polynomials influences the topology of the maps which we count ; hence the degree of the covariance @xmath226 is smaller than the degrees of individual summands @xmath227 and @xmath221 which will have interesting consequences .    if the number of cycles is bigger , instead of covariance one should consider a _ cumulant _ @xmath228 which measures in a more refined way how much the character @xmath229 differs from products of characters with simpler cycle structure .",
    "all the above mentioned results hold true also in this more general setup .",
    "the fact that the degree of the cumulant @xmath228 is much smaller than the sum of degrees of the individual factors implies that ( if proper normalization is chosen ) @xmath230 regarded in a rather abstract way as random variables are asymptotically gaussian .",
    "more specifically , this implies that a generalization of _ kerov s central limit theorem _ holds true : for a wide class of reducible representations of the symmetric groups if we randomly select an irreducible component @xmath191 ( like in section [ subsec : biane ] ) , the fluctuations of the shape of @xmath188 will be asymptotically gaussian .",
    "this is yet another application of kerov polynomials and their combinatorics .",
    "as a rule , open problems are much more interesting than the solved ones . fortunately , there are still several mysteries concerning kerov polynomials and related objects .",
    "we will review some of these open problems .",
    "just like kerov s conjecture , they are also related to positivity , thus they hint at some unexpected hidden combinatorial structures and we hope that investigation of them will be as profitable as the investigation of kerov conjecture was .",
    "goulden - rattan polynomials express _ the difference _",
    "@xmath231 as a polynomial in @xmath232 ( where @xmath233 are some quantities , related to free cumulants , describing the shape of a young diagram ) .",
    "for example @xmath234 these polynomials are less complicated then the corresponding kerov polynomials ( i.e. , contain a smaller number of summands ) , which suggests that @xmath235 are better , _ more fundamental _ , for understanding the deviation from the approximation @xmath236 . furthermore , the coefficients of these polynomials seem to be positive rational numbers with relatively small denominators",
    ". it would be more difficult to find a combinatorial interpretation of positive numbers which are not integers , nevertheless this possibility is very tempting .",
    "lassalle observed that just like normalized characters describe the dual combinatorics of representations of symmetric groups , it is possible to consider the dual combinatorics of _ jack polynomials_. in this way one can obtain a quite natural deformation of the characters of the symmetric group with an additional parameter @xmath237 .",
    "also in this more general case it is possible to find kerov polynomials , for example @xmath238 as the reader can see , the coefficients of these more general kerov polynomials also seem to be non - negative integers .",
