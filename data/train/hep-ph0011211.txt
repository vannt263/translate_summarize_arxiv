    "the phase structure of qcd at non - zero temperature and baryon density is important for the physics of neutron stars and heavy ion collisions .",
    "the approximate phase structure for qcd with different numbers of quark flavors has been mapped out in various mean field and perturbative approximations @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the phase structure for two masless quark flavors ( up and down ) already reveals a rich sturcture .",
    "in addition to the well known chiral symmetry broken and restored phases , recent investigations have revealed the possibility of a color superconducting phase at low temperatures and relatively high densities .",
    "the transition to the superconducting phase as we increase @xmath5 at zero temperature is first order . on the other hand , in the chiral condensation regime at zero chemical potential , the phase transition as we increase the temperature to the unbroken mode",
    "is second order .",
    "this suggests that there is a regime at intermediate chemical potentials where the chiral phase transition is first order . along the line separating the broken and unbroken chiral phases",
    "there is a tricritical point .",
    "one of the most pressing experimental questions is to what extent experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider rhic can explore this rich phase structure and what would be the experimental consequences of having a quark - gluon plasma rather than a hadronic plasma following a collision of heavy ions .",
    "since the production and evolution of the quark - gluon plasma in a heavy ion collision might be a nonequilibrium process , one needs to understand the evolution of an expanding , possibly out of equilibrium , plasma .",
    "we have considered a toy model , which has several properties in common with two flavor massless qcd to explore these nonequilibrium evolutions .",
    "the model we have found @xcite is a @xmath6 dimensional model of self interacting fermions , that has , in the leading order in large - n ( loln ) approximation a phase diagram with properties similar to that of massless two flavor qcd such as a tricritical point as well as a superconducting phase transition as one increases @xmath5 at low temperature . since an ultrarelativistic collision leads to an essentially one dimensional expansion at early times , it is hoped that the rate of expansion in our toy model will be similar to that found in qcd so that the rate the system undergoes the phase transition will be similar to what would be found in a a more realistic @xmath7 dimensional expansion . since this model has asymptotic freedom , the coupling constants run logarithmically in loln which is a feature shared with qcd . in this paper",
    "we will confine ourselves for studying the dynamics near the tricritical point in our toy model which for that case reduces to the gross - neveu model .",
    "one of the questions important for rhic is whether there are unambiguous experimental signatures resulting from a change in the nature of the phase transition as a function of the chemical potential ( baryon density ) . in our toy model , the change is the difference from a first order to second order transition .",
    "in actuality this change might be the change from a first order transition to a crossover phenomena .",
    "our approach is to directly determine the time evolution of the plasma starting from an initial point on the phase diagram above the chiral phase transition and watch the evolution through the phase transition . from the time evolving fermion mode functions one can calculate many physical quantities such as the current current correlation function which determines the dilepton rate as well as various particle correlation functions such as that for the pion . in this paper",
    "we determine single particle distributions functions as well as the composite particle pion correlation function to try to find the difference in experimentally measurable quantities when a plasma evolutions traversing say a first rather than a second order phase transition . for the purpose of studying the chiral phase transition",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to just a sector of our toy model in which it reduces to the well known gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite .",
    "this simpler model allows us to study evolutions on both sides of a tricritical point .",
    "the exact phase structure of the gross - neveu model in dimensions @xmath8 at finite temperature and chemical potential has been the subject of several recent investigations @xcite . using both renormalization group methods , dimensional reduction methods as well as strong coupling expansions",
    ", it is thought that the line of chiral phase transitions in all these dimensions is either second order or weakly first order , which is the same situation as pertains in the leading order in large - n calculation .",
    "what is missing in the leading order",
    "large - n is real scatterings that could lead to rethermalization .",
    "therefore , the findings of our simulations that the distributions of fermions and antifermions goes far out of equilibrium following the transition , might easily be modified by a more realistic simulation .",
    "the calculations presented here must be thought of as presenting the first field theory simulations at finite chemical potential of an evolution through a chiral phase transition with a realistic expansion rate for the plasma appropriate to a heavy ion collision .",
    "future studies will remedy some of the shortcomings of this toy model , in that inhomogeneous plasmas will be studied as well as @xmath9 resummation methods will be used in future simulations which will still be based , however on gross - neveu like models albeit in @xmath7 dimensions as well as in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "the approach we take here is to directly solve the evolution equations of a quantum plasma in leading order in large - n .",
    "a complementary approach is to study critical slowing near the critical point using ideas from universality and dynamical critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "our interest is more in having a complete space time picture of an evolving quark plasma and our hope is that once we resum the loln approximation using dyson equations and consider the @xmath7 dimensional version of this model that we will be able to address issues of critical slowing down .",
    "the calculations presented here in the toy model already exhibit the effects of how having small rather than zero quark masses at high temperatures change the time period of the transition .",
    "they also demonstrate how one can calculate all spatial correlation functions as well as the time evolution of the temperature and chemical potential , and how a hydrodynamic approach can be quite accurate before the phase transiton .",
    "following a relativistic heavy ion collision , the ensuing plasma expands and cools traversing the chiral phase transition . in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions @xcite , as well as in parton cascade models and",
    "other event genarator approaches @xcite , one finds that it is a reasonable approximation to treat the initial phase of the expansion as a 1 + 1 dimensional boost invariant expansion along the beam ( @xmath10 ) axis . in this approximation ,",
    "the fluid velocity scales as @xmath11 . in terms of the variables",
    "fluid rapidity @xmath12 and fluid proper time @xmath13 , physical quantities such as @xmath14 become independent of @xmath15 , as discussed in refs . @xcite .",
    "such an approach was used in our field theory calculations of the production and evolution of disoriented chiral condensates in the o(4 ) @xmath1 model in ref.@xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid for particles produced in the central rapidity region . to study more peripheral collisions a full inhomogenous calculation",
    "must be performed .",
    "this latter study has just started and will be the subject of a future paper .",
    "these kinematical considerations translate into the expansion being homogeneous in the fluid rapdity @xmath15 , which allows us to convert what would be a set of partial differential equations for the mode functions to a much simpler set of ordinary differential equations in the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the loln approximation we will use in obtaining the field equations has been been discussed earlier by ourselves and others in @xcite and applied to the problem of disoriented chiral condensates in @xcite . extending the boost invariant simulation to @xmath7 dimensions so that transverse distributions can be studies is relatively simple .    in solving the time evolution equations for the quantum fields ,",
    "the initial conditions for the fields are specified at @xmath16 , that is , on a hyperbola of constant proper time .",
    "the @xmath2 evolving energy density and pressure are obtained from the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor . to discuss the production of particles we introduce the concept of an adiabatic number operator which is an adiabatic invariant of the loln hamiltonian .",
    "although our equations will be valid for arbitrary initial conditions , to study the regime around the tricritical point we will assume that at some initial proper time the system can be described by a fermi - dirac distribution with given @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the comoving frame . in our simulations we will also choose the initial conditions on our mode functions to agree with the lowest order wkb approximation result . by choosing this initial condition on the mode functions",

    "the phase diagram at finite chemical potential and temperature shares features with that of massless 2-flavor qcd .",
    "we found that if we start in the unbroken symmetry phase , the system remains in equilibrium until the phase transition and then goes rapidly out of equilibrium as the phase transition is traversed .",
    "the effects of the phase transition are greatest when we traverse a first order phase transition and are most noticable in the anti - fermion distribution function .",
    "if these effects survive hard scatterings then this should have an effect on the distribution of dileptons , just as the overpopulation of soft pions during dcc production effected the distruibution of dileptons as discussed by us earlier @xcite .",

    "hard scatterings are ignored in this approximation , the competition between the expansion of the plasma and the competing process for re - equilbration could not be studied here . also by restricting our simulations to inhomogeneities which are boost invariant , we were not able to look at bubble nucleation .",
    "in future investigations we will attempt to remedy the shortcomings just mentioned .",
    "we will perform mean field simulations for inhomogeneous initial conditions which we discussed before @xcite and which have already been undertaken in scalar field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "there are also now two different approaches for going beyond @xmath9 based on schwinger dyson equations which we hope we can implement to study whether rethermalization can occur for the type of expansion expected following a heavy ion collision .",
    "these approaches are based on different approximations for the generating functional for the 2-pi irreducible graphs @xcite @xcite and should allow us to study the question of rethermalization .",
    "we also want to extend our simulation to a more realistic o(4 ) 4-fermi model in @xmath7 dimensions so that we can directly study the effect of the phase transition on pion correlation functions .",
