    "in recent years the spin - dependent shockley  read  hall recombination attracts a considerable attention since it allows one to obtain anomalously high values of spin polarization of conduction electrons in nonmagnetic semiconductors at room temperature @xcite ( see also the review paper @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this effect is the spin - dependent capture of optically oriented conduction electrons onto deep paramagnetic centers in which case the electrons localized on the centers become dynamically spin - polarized and , acting as a spin filter , block the further recombination of conduction - band electrons with the majority spin orientation .",
    "the spin filter efficiency increases with increasing the pumping which allows one , at high pumping powers , to get the electron polarization close to 100% .",
    "the nonlinear coupling of the spin subsystems of free and localized electrons leads to a number of striking effects in a magnetic field .",
    "particularly , the electron spin depolarization in the magnetic field perpendicular to the exciting beam ( hanle effect , the voigt geometry ) is described by a superposition of two lorentzian contours with widths at half maximum differing by two or three orders : the large spin relaxation time of localized electrons ( @xmath61 ns ) determines the width of the narrow contour ( @xmath6100 g ) whereas the short lifetime of free electrons ( @xmath61ps ) sets the width @xmath625 kg of the wide contour @xcite .",
    "also , it has recently been established @xcite that the magnetic field directed along the exciting beam ( the faraday geometry ) can lead to an increase in the efficiency of spin filter and , as a consequence , to a substantial ( up to twice ) enhancement of the electron polarization and intensity of the edge photoluminescence ( pl ) at low and moderate pumping rates .",
    "this effect is based on the longitudinal - magnetic - field induced suppression of the electron spin depolarization caused by the hyperfine interaction of a localized electron with the nucleus of the paramagnetic center which localizes this electron .",
    "additionally , the experiment shows that the magnetic - field dependences of pl circular polarization and intensity are shifted with respect to zero field by @xmath6100 g @xcite .",
    "this shift changing its sign with the sign reversal of the pump circular polarization has been attributed @xcite to the overhauser field @xmath7 created by the dynamically polarized nucleus of the paramagnetic center and acting back on the localized electron . in refs .",
    "@xcite the analysis of the experimental data obtained at room temperature was performed assuming the regime of strong hyperfine coupling of the electron spin with the nuclear spin of the paramagnetic center on which the electron is localized . by definition , in this regime the hyperfine splitting between the levels with angular momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the nuclear momentum ) exceeds their widths defined by the electron and nuclear reciprocal spin relaxation lifetimes .",
    "the strong coupling regime was proved by the observation of a multiline spectrum of the optically detected electron spin resonance ( epr ) on the ga@xmath11 self - interstitial defects responsible for the spin - dependent recombination in gaasn @xcite .",
    "however , the epr measurements were performed at helium temperature and the results of their analysis were extrapolated to room temperature .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is known @xcite that , in case of the hyperfine coupling of a localized electron with a large number @xmath12 of nuclei of the crystal lattice ( weak coupling of the electron with each particular nucleus ) , the nuclear field can reach a value of @xmath13 t. being added to the external magnetic field , it leads to a radical change in the electron polarization .",
    "the action of nuclear field most clearly manifests itself in the external magnetic field tilted at an angle @xmath0 with respect to the optical pumping direction . in this case the nuclear field @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , a deviation of the external magnetic field from the sample surface plane by only a few degrees can result in the overhauser field of several kilogauss which shifts away the hanle curve by the same value from the zero - field point @xcite .",
    "thus , the asymmetry of hanle curve in a tilted magnetic field can be used for a qualitative determination of the type , strong or weak , of hyperfine coupling at the paramagnetic centers in gaasn at room temperature .    in this work",
    "we have performed room temperature measurements of the pl circular polarization and intensity in gaasn in the magnetic field oriented at different angles to the exciting beam of circularly polarized light .",
    "optical excitation is carried out by a laser radiation normally incident on the sample surface ; the secondary emission is recorded in the backscattering geometry .",
    "it turns out that the narrow contour of the hanle curve associated with the depolarization of localized electrons by the perpendicular component of the external field is not shifted from zero magnetic field even at high , up to 45@xmath15 , deviation angles of the magnetic field from the plane normal to the excitation direction .",
    "this observation allows us to conclude that the hyperfine interaction at the paramagnetic centers in gaasn remains strong , i.e. , at room temperature a localized electron also interacts mainly with the single nucleus of the paramagnetic center .",
    "this result is a direct experimental proof of the strong hyperfine coupling in dilute gaasn alloys at room temperature , in the same conditions where the anomalously large electron spin polarization was registered .    for a theoretical description of the experimental results ,",
    "we apply the model of optical orientation in semiconductors taking into account ( i ) the spin - dependent recombination via deep paramagnetic centers and ( ii ) the hyperfine coupling at the defects and developed earlier for the longitudinal magnetic field and the spin @xmath16=1/2 @xcite .",
    "we have generalized this model to arbitrary angle between the magnetic field and the exciting beam direction in which case the number of equations increases from 11 to 25 as compared to the model in the longitudinal field .",
    "the description becomes more complicated because , at oblique magnetic field , all the spin - density matrix components for the defects with one or two electrons are different from zero .",
    "we have calculated the basic dependencies .",
    "the maxima of computed magnetic - field dependences of the pl circular polarization and intensity are not shifted away from the field zero , in the full agreement with the experimental curves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the experimental conditions and obtained results , section 3 is devoted to a description of the theory for the nuclear spin @xmath16 = 1/2 and the tilted magnetic field , in section 4 we discuss the results of calculation and compare them with the experiment .",
    "we investigated the electron spin polarization in the undoped dilute gaas@xmath17n@xmath18 alloy grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( with a plasma source for nitrogen ) in the form of a 0.1@xmath19m - thick layer on the semi - insulating gaas(001 ) substrate @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization @xmath20 of the free electrons was generated under interband absorption of the circularly polarized light @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 rapidly decrease by tens percent with a half - width at half - maximum @xmath39 g. the remaining intensity is independent of the field , while the polarization slowly decreases with a further increase of the field .",
    "the strong changes in @xmath3 and @xmath4 within the interval of 100 g are consequences of the magnetic depolarization ( hanle effect ) of electrons localized on deep paramagnetic centers @xcite . in a strong transverse field",
    "the localized electrons are unpolarized .",
    "therefore the recombination rate of free photoelectrons and hence the intensity of interband photoluminescence are independent of the field .",
    "a slow reduction of the pl circular polarization occurs due to manifestation of the hanle effect on free electrons characterized by a small spin lifetime . for @xmath40 , in the whole range of fields",

    "the curves @xmath45 and @xmath46 are asymmetric : their minima are shifted relative to the point @xmath47 , and the shift changes its sign under reversal of the excitation circular polarization from @xmath28 to @xmath29 . as shown in refs .",

    "[ fig2 ] these two contours are displayed by dotted and dashed lines . the narrow contour is symmetric with respect to the zero field while , in contrast , the broad one is shifted relative to the point @xmath47 in the same direction as it does in purely longitudinal geometry .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , ( a ) and ( c ) , that with increasing the tilt angle the contribution of the narrow lorentzian increases and that of the broad lorentzian decreases . a big difference between the widths of the narrow and broad contours , as well as the change of their relative contributions with varying the angle @xmath0 , indicates that the shape of curves @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the oblique field is determined by the interplay between the depolarization of localized electrons by the transverse component of the external field @xmath51 and the slowdown of their spin relaxation due to the longitudinal component @xmath52 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the peak of narrow part of the curve @xmath3 or @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] does not shift with decreasing the tilt angle from 90@xmath15 to 45@xmath15 which is particularly evident in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of fig . 1 where the field scale is especially stretched .",

    "the model with the nuclear spin 1/2 is relatively simple and , as will be shown , qualitatively explains the symmetricity of the central peak and confirms the regime of strong hyperfine interaction of the localized electron , thereby excluding the regime of weak interaction . as stated in @xcite , in order to explain the shift of the curves @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the longitudinal field one should consider nuclei with the moment @xmath55 , this task is planned to be addressed elsewhere .    using the kinetic equations for the spin - density matrices for the deep centers with one electron and two electrons , we have derived the set of equations interrelating 25 variables @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) for an arbitrary direction of the field @xmath54 .",

    "the deviation of the magnetic field from the direction of excitation is accompanied by an appearance of a normal lorentzian in the form of a narrow maximum at @xmath169 superimposed on the background of the broad inverted lorentzian . with the increasing inclination of the field the contribution of narrow lorentzian increases and that of the broad one decreases , and at @xmath38",
    "only the narrow lorentzian remains .",
    "in contrast to the hyperfine interaction of an electron bound to a shallow donor with a large number of nuclei of the crystal lattice , in the studied electron - nuclear system the variation of the magnetic - field tilt angle is not followed by an appearance , in the magnetic - field dependence of the electron polarization , of an additional narrow peak shifted with respect to the point @xmath151 .",
    "this result demonstrates that , in the gaasn alloy , the hyperfine interaction of a localized electron with the single nucleus of the paramagnetic center keeps being strong even at room temperature . for a theoretical description of the experiment ,",
    "we have used a model of spin - dependent recombination through deep paramagnetic centers with the nuclear momentum @xmath5 , previously developed by us for the longitudinal field , and generalized it to an arbitrary angle of the magnetic field orientation . since in case of the oblique field all components of the spin - density matrix for the defects with one or two electrons are different from zero , in the modified model , as compared with the theory for the longitudinal field , the number of equations increases from 11 to 25 .",
    "the calculated theoretical dependences @xmath3 , @xmath4 agree with the approximate description of the experimental curves in the form of two lorentzians , a second narrow shifted contour does not appear as well .",
