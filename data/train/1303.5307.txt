    "when introducing the concept of observable quantity in equilibrium thermodynamics , one must keep in mind the fact that the observation itself should be carried out in discrete intervals of time that are widely separated from one another . when standing on a purely mathematical point of view , one of the presently most noted physicists told him that the asymptotics near the turning points can not be considered as semiclassics because the landau criterion for being semiclassical is violated there .",
    "the author , as a mathematician , believed that the asymptotics even in the domain of deep shadow and the `` instantons '' obtained for the imaginary number  @xmath3 can still be considered as the semiclassical asymptotics .",
    "recently , yu .  m.  kagan clearly explained the author that the physicists mean only the case @xmath4 when speaking about the bose ",
    "einstein distribution .",
    "but the author , as a mathematician , believed that this restriction is artificial and considered system ( 1)(4 ) in the general case , without any restrictions on the number @xmath5 of particles at the @xmath6th energy level .",
    "but the natural restriction @xmath7 , @xmath8 , still exists and is taken into account by the author .",
    "einstein condensate also exists but in a small neighborhood of the zeroth energy level ( small compared with  @xmath9 ) rather than at a single point .",
    "the author continues to use the name `` bose  einstein '' for the obtained distribution and the condensate phenomenon .",
    "the general asymptotics is constructed for @xmath10 , and this asymptotics holds for @xmath11 .",
    "] , one must agree that the processes of establishing an equilibrium require infinite time . however , in mathematics there are some concepts which are similar to the notion of `` half - life '' in physics . for example , one can introduce a time interval during which the difference between the current state and the state of equilibrium in the course of relaxation becomes @xmath12 times less .    in approximation theory and in the theory of numerical methods , especially after the well - known paper of mandelshtam and leontovich  @xcite , the following relaxation process was in use : at first , a reacting system is brought to some equilibrium .",
    "then one rapidly changes one of the conditions ( e.g. , the temperature or the pressure ) and traces the evolution of the system towards a new equilibrium ( see , for example , the article `` method  relaxation '' in the great encyclopedia of oil and gas , http://www.ngpedia.ru [ in russian ] ) .",
    "since the observation intervals should be `` equal '' to the relaxation time , they are large enough , and one can refer to the process as the _ multi - step relaxation process _ ( mrp ) . economic and historical processes , and also biological processes in a living organism , belong to phenomena of this kind , and therefore , from time to time , thermodynamic models of these processes arise .",
    "the formation of clusters , according to the scheme suggested below in sec .  3.2 , can serve as an example of a multi - step relaxation process .",
    "the fact that time intervals of observation are discrete is the most important point to be taken into account when speaking about the instruments of observation .",
    "the difference between readings of measuring macro- and microinstruments in thermodynamics is related to the following aspects .",
    "a macroinstrument does not take into account the motions of nuclei , of electrons , and even of atoms within a molecule and regards any molecule as an individual particle .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to imposing rigid constraints on the elements forming the molecule .",
    "that is , we must modify those axioms of mechanics in which we consider all elementary particles and their behavior in the configuration space whose dimension is equal to the tripled number of elementary particles .    \\2",
    ". a macroinstrument measuring density counts the number of particles in a fragment of the volume ; however , it can not trace the movements of particles with different numbers during discrete finite time intervals . at each discrete time moment , this device counts the number of particles in the same fragment ; however , it can not notice what is the exact position of any particle indexed at the previous time moment and whether or not this particle really is within the chosen fragment .",
    "mathematically , this means that the arithmetical law of rearrangement of summands holds .",
    "the sum does not depend on the way in which we have indexed the particles . in this sense ,",
    "the laws of classical mechanics are even modified in a more substantial way .",
    "let us quote from the textbook  @xcite on quantum mechanics , where the authors define the basic property of classical mechanics : `` in classical mechanics , identical particles ( e.g. , electrons ) do not lose their ` personality , ' despite the identity of their physical properties .",
    "specifically , you can imagine that the particles forming a given physical system are ` indexed ' at some time moment and then one can trace the motion of each of the particles along its own trajectory ; then the particles can be identified at any time moment .  in quantum mechanics , it is fundamental that there is no way to trace each of the identical particles separately and thus to distinguish them .",
    "we can say that , in quantum mechanics , identical particles completely lose their individuality '' ( russian p.  252 ) .",
    "a macroinstrument does not keep this basic property either .",
    "mathematically , this means that , to take this property into account , we should impose some new constraints , which are already explicitly nonholonomic , on the mechanics of many particles and , which is especially important , we should take into account the permutability of particles in the definition of density , namely , _ any permutation of particles does not modify the density_.    in thermodynamics , the gas molecule density is measured .",
    "although the gas molecules differ from each other and the boltzman approach to studying the molecules is consistent with the objective reality , the difference between the molecules does not play any role when the molecule density is determined .",
    "if the density is considered in a small fragment of the vessel , which contains approximately a million of particles , then it turns out that the density in this fragment coincides with the average density in the entire vessel up to a thousand of particles ( up to 0.1 % ) and is independent of the particle numeration .",
    "it follows from these considerations that the entropy ( in contrast to the boltzmann ",
    "shannon entropy ) should take into account the permutability of the indices of the particles ( cf .",
    "@xcite , sec .",
    "hence , for an ideal gas @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the average number of particles in each of the @xmath16 states of the @xmath17th group and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are some constants ( see  @xcite , the footnote on p.  184 , and also  @xcite and  @xcite ) , the entropy must be of the form @xmath20 @xmath21.\\tag{4}\\ ] ] in other words , the entropy has exactly the same form as in the bose ",
    "einstein quantum case .",
    "this face is proved for balls and boxes in  @xcite in the footnote in sec .",
    "46 ; also see  @xcite .",
    "we have noted above that a macroinstrument and its measurements force mathematicians to reorganize even the axioms of classical mechanics .",
    "however , mathematicians are forced to do so by entering the corresponding small parameters and passing to the related limits .",
    "a macroinstrument and its measurements still reduce the time spent to perform constructions of this kind . however ,",
    "when one speaks of the axioms of thermodynamics , which is based on laws derived by great physicists who used ancient experiments conducted on earth , it then turns out that the above considerations modify the classical concept of thermodynamics completely .",
    "meanwhile , microinstruments of a molecule is much less than the typical length of the vessel ( provided that the shape of the vessel is given ) '' , i.e. , there are two scales in the problem , which correspond to macro- and microinstruments . ] also play a role in classical thermodynamics ; they enable one to calculate the dimension related to the number of atoms in the molecule .    in the mathematical literature , as a rule , the number of degrees of freedom coincides with the number of independent generalized coordinates .",
    "however , there notions are distinct in the standard thermodynamics , because the volume is three - dimensional , which is established by the macrodevice , whereas the number of degrees of freedom is related to the number of atoms in a molecule and is measured by the microdevice .",
    "let us explain the following experimental fact . in some cases",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom for diatomic and polyatomic molecules is an integer . in our opinion",
    ", this happens because the intramolecular communications ( the distances between the atoms of the molecule ) are very hard , and , when the temperature increases , no new degrees of freedom arise .",
    "generally speaking , the number of degrees of freedom fundamentally depends on the energy of the molecules , and the energy of different molecules of the same gas is different , and , apparently , to the average energy ( the temperature ) there must correspond the average number of degrees of freedom , which is hence must be noninteger .",
    "however , on one hand , tight connections enable one to excite almost all molecules for a sufficiently high ( room ) temperature and , on the other hand , to give the molecules no possibility to excite new degrees of freedom ( e.g. , the vibrational ones ) .",
    "if the connections are not so rigid , then the number of degrees of freedom depends on temperature , and hence on energy , and is not an integer in general .",
    "this is clear from the comparison of the values of the heat capacity @xmath22 with the experiment : for hydrogen sulfide with three atoms , the theory gives 5.96 , and the experiment 6.08 , for carbon dioxide , the experiment gives a greater value @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , and , for carbon disulfide , the vale is almost two times larger , namely , 9.77",
    ". in the case of diatomic molecules , say , for nitrogen , the theory gives 4.967 and the experiment shows 4.93 ; for the chlorine , the value is almost 20% higher , namely , 5.93 , etc .",
    "it turns out that the number of degrees of freedom coincides with the dimension of the generalized bose gas which is regarded as a distribution of a classical gas .",
    "landau and lifshitz notice this fact for the three - dimensional bose gas .",
    "they write that these equations ( @xmath26 ) coincide with the equations of the adiabatic line for an ordinary monatomic gas .",
    "`` however , we stress , '' the authors write further , `` that the exponents in the formulas @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not related now to the ratio of specific heat capacities ( since the relations @xmath29 and @xmath30 fail to hold ) ''  @xcite , p.  187 .",
    "one can show in a quite similar way that , for the five - dimensional and six - dimensional bose gas , the `` poisson adiabatic line '' coincides with the poisson adiabat for the two - atomic and three - atomic molecule ( see  @xcite , sec .",
    "47 , diatomic gas with molecules of different atoms .",
    "rotation of molecules ) . with regard to the above stipulation , as @xmath31",
    ", we obtain precisely both the condition @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath32 coinciding with relations well known in the old thermodynamics .    the three - dimensional case of the bose ",
    "einstein - type distribution can be represented as @xmath33 @xmath34 the bose ",

    "let us now proceed with finding the number of degrees of freedom for for a low temperature that does not exceed the critical one : @xmath43 .",
    "the maxwell  boltzmann equation for the ideal gas is of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 stands for the pressure , @xmath46 for the volume , @xmath47 for the number of particles , and @xmath48 for the temperature .",

    "* example 1 . *",
    "consider the example given by a famous theorem in number theory , namely , the solution of an ancient problem , which has the latin title `` partitio numerorum . ''",
    "this task involves an integer @xmath97 which is decomposed into @xmath47 terms , for example , if @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then @xmath100 which gives two solutions to the problem , @xmath101 .    if @xmath102 and @xmath103 , then the decomposition has only one version , and @xmath104 . if @xmath102 and @xmath105 , then there is also only one version of decomposition , namely , the sum of ones , i.e. , @xmath106 .",
    "obviously , there is a number @xmath107 for a fixed @xmath97 such that the number of versions of the decomposition , @xmath108 , is maximal possible ( this number is not unique in general ) .",
    "the number @xmath109 is referred to as the _ hartley entropy_. at the point at which @xmath110 reaches its maximum , there is a maximum entropy .    let a partition @xmath111 of @xmath97 into @xmath47 summands be given . denote by @xmath112 the number of summands on the right - hand side that are precisely equal to  @xmath17 .",
    "then the total number of summands is @xmath113 , and this number is equal to @xmath47 , since we know that the total number of summands is @xmath47 .",
    "further , the sum of the parts equal to @xmath17 is @xmath114 , since there are @xmath112 summands , and then the sum of all summands can be obtained by summing these expressions over all possible @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath115 , and this sum is equal to @xmath97 .",
    "namely , @xmath116    the very nonuniqueness of the above maximum and an uncertainty concerning the number of the maxima enabled erds to obtain results with accuracy up to @xmath117 only .",
    "thus , the erds theorem holds for the system of two diophantine equations @xmath118 the maximum number of solutions of the system is achieved provided that the following relation holds : @xmath119 and the coefficient @xmath120 is defined by the formula @xmath121 .",
    "if one increases the number  @xmath47 in problem   and keeps the number  @xmath97 constant , then the number of solutions decreases .",
    "if the sums in   are counted from zero rather than from one , i.e. , @xmath122 then the number of solutions does not decrease and remains constant .",
    "let us explain this fact .",
    "the erds ",
    "lehner problem  @xcite is to decompose a number @xmath123 into @xmath124 summands .",
    "the decomposition of the number 5 into two summands has two versions . if we include also 0 , then we obtain three versions , 5 + 0 = 3 + 2 = 4 + 1 .",
    "thus , the inclusion of zero gives the opportunity to say that we decompose the number into @xmath125 summands .",
    "indeed , the expansion of the number 5 into 3 summands includes all previous versions : 5 + 0 + 0 , 3 + 2 + 0 .",
    "and 4 + 1 + 0 and adds new options that do not contain zero .    here",
    "the maximum does not change much  @xcite ; however , the number of options can not decrease , because the zeros enable the maximum to remain constant , and the entropy never decreases ; after reaching the maximum , it becomes constant .",
    "this very remarkable property of entropy enables us to construct a general unbounded probability theory  @xcite . in physics ,",
    "the effect is identical to the so - called phenomenon of bose condensate .",
    "let us pose the following question : what is the difference between arithmetic , together with the problem of `` partitio numerorum , '' and the boltzmann ",
    "shannon statistics ?",
    "if we assume that @xmath126 and @xmath127 are two different versions , then we obtain the boltzmann  shannon statistics .",
    "the number of versions of decomposition , @xmath108 , is growing rapidly .",
    "thus , the `` noncommutativity '' of the addition gives additionally a huge number of versions of decomposition , and the hartley entropy ( which is equal to the logarithm of the number of versions ) coincides with the boltzmann  shannon entropy .",
    "therefore , we have proved that , if we add zero to the family of possible summands and decompose a number @xmath97 into @xmath47 summands , then this is equivalent to solving equations  , i.e. , to imposing relations for the number of particles and for energy . here",
    "the number of zeros increases drastically ; if @xmath98 , then , for @xmath128 , the number of zeros is 22 .",
    "however , the number of ones is also large , although it is twice smaller than the number of zeros .",
    "it is very visible to consider the bose condensate as the number of zeros ; however , this is inaccurate .",
    "the bose condensate occurs in a neighborhood of a point at which the energy vanishes rather than at the point itself",
    ". nevertheless , if one writes @xmath129 ( where @xmath130 stands for the density and the vector @xmath131 is the momentum ) for the bose condensate at rest , then this notation is true , because the density is the limit @xmath132 where @xmath47 stands for the number of particles , @xmath46 for the volume , and @xmath55 for the mass of the particle .",
    "this means that , as @xmath133 , the bell - shaped function near the zero energy is converted to the @xmath134 function .    by an ideal ( or perfect ) liquid we mean a liquid without attraction and without any surface tension",
    "this is a liquid which can exist for a positive pressure only together with a saturated steam .    in this case , the perfect liquid is the result of an optical illusion , and this `` perfect liquid '' is the same ideal gas in the condensate , with another density .",
    "it can be described , as in the case of a consideration of a bose condensate , in the form @xmath129 , where @xmath135 stands for the density of the condensate .",
    "it can not exist without a volume trap , which is similar to the case in which a container with gas has a hole , and there is a vacuum outside the vessel , in which case this liquid , which looks as if it is boiled , is going away together with the gas . the mean speed of the particles inside the liquid is the same as the mean speed of the gas particles .",
    "this corresponds to the condition that the temperature in the system `` liquid  saturated steam '' is the same in the liquid and in the gas .",
    "the liquid in a closed vessel is a fluctuation standing at a fixed place ( @xmath136 ) , or , speaking in a simpler way , this liquid is a `` resting '' bose condensate ( cf .",
    "@xcite , p.204 ) .",
    "small crystals that occur in a supersaturated solution coincide with the bose condensate only if they are not composed of mutually connected particles , and , moreover , if the particles are continuously exchanged with the particles in the solution ; moreover , the small crystals , as solids , are an optical illusion , namely , we simply do not see that the particles of crystals are permanently transposed with particles of the solution .",
    "in other words , this is by no means a crystal , this is a fluctuation ; however , this fluctuation is relatively immobile .",
    "thus , the bose condensate for classical particles represents some `` special density fluctuations ; '' only this , and nothing more .",
    "a.  i.  anselm constructed his theory starting from the eyring formula for free energy .",
    "the liquid structure model accepted by eyring is in fact closer to the strongly compresses gas model  @xcite .",
    "one can talk about the density in a `` special cluster fluctuation '' of a part of our vessel with gas .",
    "if we speak of the density in this cluster only , this means that ( as in the example of a small volume with one million of particles ) one can not speak of the number of particles that are placed in the cluster as if they are frozen and do not move .",
    "this is only an appearance , and all of the particles or a part of them can be replaced in a minute by another ones , and the indexing inside the `` fluctuation '' cluster can change every minute . at the next time step",
    ", this can be the same picture but probably with different particles involved .",
    "we speak about some fragment of the volume .",
    "in fact , the particles that are more concentrated can be spread out over the entire vessel .",
    "however , if there is at least a little gravity of the earth , then the fluctuations with more concentrated particles accumulate near the bottom .",
    "if we consider a vessel with gas in the form of a perfectly reflecting sphere ( see  @xcite@xcite ) , then , due to the repulsive force occurring at the border , fluctuations of this kind are located near the center of the ball .    from the standpoint of our observation , in discrete time intervals at far distances from each other ,",
    "the denser fragment of the volume , i.e. , the bose condensate , is at rest and hence corresponds to a small momentum in the bose ",
    "einstein - type distribution .",
    "mathematically , the mrp model corresponds to this phenomenon .",
    "this property will be called the _ relativity principle for mrp_.",
    "let us repeat once again that the only fact which can be guaranteed by the generalized theory of bose condensate is that there will be a higher density of particles at the bottom .",
    "* example 2 .",
    "* let a gas be contained in a closed vessel at a room temperature , and let the gas be almost satisfying the clausius relation @xmath137 we cool the vessel down to a temperature @xmath138 .",
    "at some temperature @xmath139 , a liquid is formed .",
    "the temperature @xmath140 is referred to as the dew point . according to the standard conception , the fluctuations above the temperature of the dew point are of the order of @xmath141 .",
    "after the formation of liquid , the gas , which is called a saturated steam in the physical literature , also satisfies relation  .",
    "it is quite rarefied . according to the van der waals model",
    ", there are no singularities at the dew point under the gas - liquid passage ( on the so - called binodal ) . according to experimental data ,",

    ", the molecules by themselves placed inside this fluctuational fragment can possibly move with the same velocities as those of the gas molecules and , if it were possible to enumerate them , then the numbers will be changed very quickly . if shall refer to this fluctuation ( of the form of the bose - einstein condensation ) as liquid , then actual molecules of the liquid move in it with the same speeds as the gas molecules ( of the `` saturated vapor '' ) .    to represent this picture in a more visible way ,",
    "imagine a bunting which winds from one roller to the other . between the rollers , under the material , a strong wind blows from a hose .",
    "we see a `` hump '' is formed between the rollers ; however , it can be assumed that we do not see that the bunting moves .    nevertheless , as the density of the bose condensate increases , our macroinstrument can fix the bound of the density and show us that there is a more dense phase and a less dense phase .",
    "hence , only the original macroinstrument can show us the bound of this abstract liquid , i.e. , of the second phase .",
    "first , the bose - condensate at rest , i.e. , the gas compaction , is being formed ( because of the relativity principle for mrp ) , and then there arise quantum forces , i.e. , attraction forces ( see below ) , acting on the `` nearest neighborhoods '' , the more so because the molecules move slower at a low temperature .",
    "if liquid droplets occur below the temperature of the `` dew point , '' then the droplets are spherical , even under the presence of the gravity of the earth ( physicists refer to the very gravity , as a rule , when claiming that the border between gas and liquid is flat ) .",
    "the pressures in the droplet and in the gas ( the saturated vapor ) are different , due to the surface tension",
    ".    therefore , the main rule of the equilibrium `` vapor - liquid , '' namely , the coincidence of the of pressures , really holds at the dew point only if we neglect the surface tension , and thus neglect the attraction of liquid molecules , because these two effects are inseparably linked with each other .",
    "our concept of a new ideal gas is based on the very assumption on the absence of attraction between the molecules .",
    "the picture in which the attraction and the surface tension play no role can be is observed in experiments if the temperature is equal to the temperature @xmath143 of the gas - liquid transition ( i.e. , at a point of the `` binodal '' ) and @xmath143 is still greater than the temperature at which a droplet of critical radius has been already formed .",
    "then , at @xmath142 , the incipient drops spontaneously shrink and occur at another point .",
    "these drops can not live without the surrounding saturated vapor ; one can see these drops but can not feel them .",
    "if the vessel is spherical and the mean free path is comparable to the size of the vessel ( similar to the so - called knudsen criterion ; see   @xcite@xcite , then the probability of such a virtual drop is larger at the center of the vessel .    in this case , if we make the labelling of several molecules by launching few isotopes which can be traced , then these isotopes will pass freely through the liquid to vapor and back , and they will form a a denser structure near the center of the ball , in such a way that , when illuminated by parallel rays , it will provide a shade . however , it is impossible to take this drop from the gas medium .",
    "one can see an ideal liquid but can not feel it .",
    "possibly it is better to refer to it as a `` virtual liquid . ''",
    "this approach is unusual for the majority of physicists .",
    "although everyone knows that , say , when photons are collected at a focus at which their `` density '' is high , then it is impossible to separate the focus from the `` photon medium . ''",
    "a mathematical analog of the quantum bose condensate for a classical gas is a liquid without attraction in which the speeds of the molecules are approximately the same as the speeds of the molecules in the saturated vapor .",
    "the attraction between molecules results in a significant correction provided that the radius of a drop is greater than the critical one ; however , this correction abolishes the conditions of the vapor  liquid equilibrium for the pressure .",
    "therefore , the problem must be divided into two separate problems , namely , 1 ) an ideal gas and a perfect liquid without attraction , and 2 ) the consideration of the attraction for the case in which the decay into two phases has already been carried out and the radius of the drop exceeds the critical value .",
    "we define the temperature from the overcondensate part of the system , i.e. , from the gas until the volume of particles in the condensate is comparatively small , i.e. , until the surface tension is formed and a drop of critical radius size appears .",

    "this means that the entropy increases in the presence of holes .",
    "therefore , to achieve the maximum of the entropy , we must also additionally mix holes into this glass .    in our conception , holes occur for @xmath262 .    in the ideal gas model",
    ", we ignore the attraction , and this means that , when `` stretching '' the liquid , which results in holes , the liquid does not resist ( as the sand , which is incompressible under the compression and does not resist under `` tension ; '' cf .",
    "the appendix to the book  @xcite ) .    once there is no attraction , there is no negative pressure  under the `` tension '' , i.e. , there is no formation of holes .",
    "if @xmath156 , then the plane @xmath161 is positive again , and therefore it is covered by the other sheet .",
    "it can readily be seen that the lines entering the point @xmath153 , @xmath263 ( i.e. , to the point @xmath155 ) are reflected on this second sheet back , along the same line .",
    "this means that it is geometrically convenient to arrange the reflection of vectors on the second sheet by using the matrix @xmath264 , where @xmath265 stands for the two - dimensional identity matrix , i.e. , to flip ( carry out the mirror reflection for ) the sheet @xmath266 to the negative quadrant .",
    "note that this procedure is compliance with the concepts of dirac hole theory , just in the opposite direction , namely , to a hole we assign a negative pressure , i.e. , a negative energy .",
    "now the straight lines can be continued through the origin to the negative quadrant , although the pressure really does not change its sign .",
    "this is only a convenient geometric `` uniformization . ''",
    "note also that , due to absence of attraction , an ideal liquid is completely plastic ; namely , it does not try to return to the original state ( the state before stretching ) . in this sense , the bose condensate for @xmath262 , which leads to this `` kind '' of liquid ,",
    "can also be treated more visually as a glass or an amorphous solid .",
    "this makes it possible to interpret the state of the liquid for @xmath262 more intuitively .",
    "the author has come to the revision of the thermodynamics when studying economics in which money is the very particles , according the correspondence principle derived by irving fisher .",
    "fisher himself did not referred to his observation as the correspondence principle . however , since he was a disciple of gibbs , there is a clear reason for the fact that the relation of the basic law of economics @xmath267 where @xmath268 stands for the amount of goods , @xmath97 for the number of money , @xmath269 for the turnover rate , and @xmath45 for the price of goods , is obviously related to the correspondence of economical and thermodynamical quantities , namely , the volume @xmath46 corresponds to the amount of goods @xmath268 , the number of money @xmath97 to the number of particles @xmath47 , the rate @xmath269 to the temperature @xmath48 .",
    "the price of goods @xmath45 is related to pressure to a lesser extent ; however , it is denoted by the same symbol .    in this correspondence principle , it is natural to correspond holes to debts and acquitting to annihilation .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the locus on which the chemical potential is zero gives the points of maximum entropy .",
    "we refer to these points as the `` new spinodal . '' in economics , this new spinodal means a kind of limit for debts  @xcite .",
    "thus , according to the relations thus obtained , we face a double covering of the plane @xmath270 for @xmath271 and @xmath272 .",
    "the meaning of the second sheet is that , for @xmath272 , the chaotic state of liquid ( as a phenomenon associated with the bose condensate ) increases when the number of holes of the type of frenkel excitons increases , and the holes are placed in the liquid , which is fluctuationally concentrated on a rather slow - moving domain ( _ from the point of view of the device discussed above _ ) , in the form of chaotic nanoholes , then the structure of the liquid becomes chaotically stretched .    here",
    "the holes - excitons can not be indexed by our device , as well as the particles , and we can speak only of the density of holes . as was already said above , it is more convenient to place the second sheet under consideration in the quadrant @xmath273 $ ] , by continuing the straight lines   through the singular point of @xmath153 , @xmath263 to the negative quadrant . in other words , to make a reflection with the help of the matrix @xmath274 , where @xmath275 stands for the identity matrix .",
    "thus , it becomes convenient to speak of `` negative pressure '' , although we neglect the attraction of particles , and hence there can be no negative pressure at all . as a rule",
    ", the pressure , as well as the temperature , is regarded as a positive quantity .",
    "we stretch the liquid , and it becomes plastically frozen up in this stretched state and does not tend to shrink back .",
    "let us explain from the point of view of physics why the extension to the negative square is natural .",
    "we compare the new ideal liquid with sand , which is incompressible under the `` compression '' and `` dost not resist '' under stretching , because there is no attraction between the grains .",
    "* example 3 . *",
    "consider a cylindrical vessel , filled with sand , whose lid is attached to the piston , in the room of the space station .",
    "the increase in the vessel with the piston leads only to a rearrangement of sand and its transformation to a floating `` dust '' in the new volume ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "if we take into account the gravitational attraction between the grains , then the phenomenon of pulling the piston creates a negative pressure , and thus it is natural to pass to the negative quadrant on the @xmath276 diagram , and then to neglect the gravitational attraction .",
    "neglecting the presence of attraction here is just as `` legitimate '' as it is in the theory of vapor - liquid equilibrium , where the condition that the pressures are equal is possible only if we neglect the surface tension .",
    "this also explains a smooth transition ( without a phase discontinuity of the first kind ) of this structure into ice , namely , a frozen glass crystallizes .",
    "mishchenko and the author  @xcite considered the transition to a two - dimensional lagrangian manifold in the four - dimensional phase space , where the pressure @xmath45 and the temperature @xmath48 ( the intensive variables ) play the role of coordinates and the extensive variables ( the volume @xmath46 and the entropy @xmath277 ) play the role of momenta for the lagrangian manifold , where the entropy is the action generating the lagrangian structure .    seemingly , there is no global canonical transformation leading to a change of this kind .",
    "this does not confuse physicists .",
    "for example , in  25 of  @xcite , `` equilibrium of a solid in an external field , '' it is said that `` from the equation @xmath278 represented in the form @xmath279 we see  ''",
    "however , formula   the expression `` represented in the form ''  .",
    "nevertheless , this `` implies '' the following conclusion : `` if the field is absent and both @xmath58 and @xmath48 are constant , then the pressure is automatically also constant . ''",
    "at the same time , the same textbook states that , at a temperature slightly below the `` dew point , ''  when the radius of the drop becomes greater than the critical value , it can be seen that the pressure of the liquid inside the drop differs from the pressure in the saturated vapor",
    ". the external field is absent .",
    "is this still thermodynamics ?",
    "other words are used ; one speaks of a vapor instead of gas and of the process of nucleation instead of the vapor - liquid equilibrium .",
    "and then a patch is immediately put on the same hole , namely , an extra term is added to  .",
    "the old thermodynamics has many patches of this kind .",
    "it turns out that this complex transformation , leading to relation  , can be carried out , as we have seen , only by continuing to the domain of negative energies .",
    "after this , one can justify the maxwell transition by introducing a small dissipation ( viscosity ) .",
    "the introduction of an infinitesimal dissipation enables one to simultaneously solve the problem of critical exponents , without using the scaling hypothesis , on which the method of renormalization group is based .",
    "let us show this .    in thermodynamics , the viscosity is absent .",
    "however , generally speaking , without an infinitesimal dissipation , an equilibrium in thermodynamics should not be attained .",
    "therefore , it is natural to implement the occurrence of this infinitesimal viscosity and then pass to the limit as the viscosity tends to zero",
    ".    the geometric quantization of the lagrangian manifold ( see   @xcite ,  11.4 ) is usually associated with the introduction of the constant @xmath280 .",

    "to these intensive quantities , there correspond related extensive quantities , namely , the entropy @xmath277 , the volume @xmath46 , and the number of particles @xmath47 .",
    "altogether , they form the phase space , where the role of coordinates is played by the intensive quantities and the role of momenta is played by the extensive quantities . in this case , a lagrangian manifold is a three - dimensional submanifold ( of the six - dimensional phase space ) on which there is an action , an analog of the integral @xmath385 , @xmath386 in mechanics .",
    "it is locally independent of the path .",
    "usually a 4-dimensional phase space @xmath387 is considered .",
    "this space corresponds to @xmath388 , @xmath389 , @xmath390 , @xmath391 , @xmath392 : @xmath393 depending on the coordinate plane of the form @xmath394 ; @xmath395 ; @xmath396 ; @xmath397 to which the lagrangian manifold is projected .",
    "the lagrange property means that the number of planes can not coincide ( there are no planes of the form @xmath398 and @xmath399 ) . to every projection there corresponds some potential ( @xmath400 is the thermodynamic potential , etc . ) .",
    "this is an obvious correspondence .",
    "if it were more elaborated , then , on one hand , the transition from the action @xmath401 to the `` action''coordinate @xmath402 would be not `` so obvious '' ( see formulas   ) . on the other hand , it would be natural to use the semiclassical ( wiener  feynman ) quantization of action rather than the scaling hypothesis .",
    "( the quantization of the lagrangian manifold differs from the full quantization of thermodynamics  @xcite in the same way in which the semiclassical bose  sommerfeld geometric quantization differs from the quantization of schrdinger , heisenberg , and feynman .",
    "the term `` dequantization , '' which is well - known in the tropical mathematics  @xcite , means the wiener or tunnel quantization of the lagrangian manifold , and then the passage to the limit as the quantization parameter ( the viscosity ) tends to zero .",
    "the second quantization is always associated with the identity of particles , and , if it is carried out for classical particles , then it is tacitly assumed that the particles are indistinguishable for the observer . instead of an @xmath47-dimensional problem",
    ", we arrive at the three - dimensional picture in which @xmath47 particles are distributed .",
    "the vlasov equation  @xcite is obtained from the second quantization of classical mechanics .",
    "however , the original arguments used by vlasov were actually based on the assumption that the particles can be regarded as identical ones .    in the classical system of hamilton equations for @xmath47 particles , even if the hamiltonian is invariant under any permutation of the particles , the initial conditions need not have this property .",
    "however , the initial conditions of the liouville equation can be regarded as data satisfying the conditions of symmetry .    indeed ,",
    "let @xmath403 are initial conditions for the hamiltonian system whose hamiltonian is invariant under every permutation @xmath404 and also under every permutation @xmath405 .",
    "for example , let @xmath406 substituting the initial conditions into the hamiltonian  , we obtain the energy @xmath407 the energy is conserved along the trajectories of the hamiltonian system .",
    "consider further the liouville equation corresponding to the hamiltonian system @xmath408 where @xmath409 stands for the poisson bracket , with the initial condition @xmath410 where @xmath275 satisfies  .",
    "this equation describes the distribution corresponding to the hamiltonian system with the initial conditions given above .    the liouville equation and the initial conditions are symmetric with respect to any transposition of @xmath411 and @xmath412 and to any transposition of @xmath413 and @xmath414 .",
    "this symmetry is preserved for the solutions . according to the gibbs distribution for the gibbs ensemble",
    ", every distribution can be expressed in terms of energy .",
    "therefore , it is symmetric with respect to any permutation of the particles .",
    "schnberg  @xcite carried out a second quantization of this system in the fock space . in  @xcite",
    ", the vlasov equation was obtained under the assumption that the interaction is small and the number of particles is large .",
    "the bbkki chains are also symmetric with respect to these permutations .",
    "hence , for any distribution in the many - body problem , such a symmetry follows .",
    "thus , we arrive at the invariance with respect to the permutations of the particles , and thus to a `` distribution of bose  einstein type '' for the statistical physics of classical particles . other mathematically rigorous arguments which lead to a `` distribution of bose",
    "einstein type , '' in the form of lemmas and theorems ( see  @xcite ) , and hence also the distributions of classical particles , obey the laws of number theory .    although a modern macroinstrument can not trace the motion of every particle ( because of discreteness of the observation times in relaxationally stepwise process ) , which is possible at the classical level , but it can distinguish between molecules and dimers or clusters .",
    "the clusters consisting of more than two molecules occur in gas much less frequently than dimers .",
    "dimers are observable at all temperatures , and a macroinstrument can calculate their average percentage at a given temperature .",
    "this is an important new phenomenon in experiment , and this phenomenon was not available to the great who formulated the basic laws of thermodynamics .",
    "dimers occur and become immediately split by monomers ( single molecules ) , and they are created and annihilated in different places .",
    "they occur because there are _ quantum _ forces of attraction between molecules ( the dipole - dipole interaction ) .",
    "the dimers are virtual , as the ideal liquid is .",
    "to take into account this important phenomenon ( the creation and annihilation of dimers ) mathematically , one obviously needs to make the `` second '' quantization and introduce the creation and annihilation operators for dimers , i.e. , for pairs .",
    "the author referred to this `` second '' quantization as the `` ultrasecond '' quantization due to the introduction of creation and annihilation operators for pairs . in the special case of the bardeen model ,",
    "this quantization was introduced in essence  @xcite ,  @xcite ; however , since this model is , roughly speaking , exactly solvable , these operators turned out to be hidden in the model in a sense .    in general , the ultrasecond quantization and the asymptotic behaviors associated with it are rather cumbersome and lead to quantum equations involving the planck constant @xmath281 .",
    "the passage to the limit as @xmath415 , and then the passage to the limit as the viscosity tends to zero , are cumbersome , and we present here only a part of this passage , which is related , as in the previous section , with the introduction of an infinitesimal viscosity into the classical scattering problem ( for @xmath416 ) .",
    "this means that we introduce the viscosity and , after manipulations , pass to the limit as the viscosity tends to zero .",
    "this procedure will enable us to find the boyle temperature @xmath1 , and then also the boyle density @xmath417 , i.e. , the so - called zeno line , which is present in the van der waals model and which was first noticed by bachinski in experiments with pure gases .",
    "we shall further obtain the so - called law of corresponding states .",
    "the attraction between the particles occurs in the quantum mechanical consideration of the dipole - dipole interaction . in the standard semiclassical limit ,",
    "if the distance between neutral molecules is fixed ( does not depend on the parameter @xmath281 , i.e. , on a dimensionless parameter proportional to @xmath281 ) , then , as @xmath415 , the attraction disappears . in this sense , the use of an attraction potential in molecular dynamics using the classical newton equations for many particles is at least baseless .",
    "however , if , along with @xmath281 , the problem involves other small and large parameters , then the attraction potential can be kept for some relationships among these parameters under the passage to the limit as @xmath415 .",
    "since the scattering problem has another parameter tending to infinity , for example , the time of scattering is considered in the interval from @xmath418 to @xmath419 , it can happen that , as @xmath420 and @xmath421 simultaneously ( provided that there is a dependence between these parameters ) , an attractive potential of the order of @xmath422 is kept ( as @xmath415 ) , where @xmath423 stands for the distance between the particles .",
    "as we see below , to obtain a `` rough '' thermodynamics leading to the law of corresponding states , it is sufficient to determine the values of the boyle temperature @xmath1 and the boyle density @xmath424 only for mercury . as is known , the mercury isotherms are very close to the van der waals model ( see fig .",
    "14 ) , and hence the lennard ",
    "jones potential model must provide a good description of the following two important facts : 1 ) attraction existence ; 2 ) collision of molecules due to a rapidly increasing repulsive potential .",
    "we present only a typical example of studying the relation between the actual gas and the interaction potential , which corresponds to the case of a small intermolecular distance such that quantum effects must inevitably arise .",
    "but the natural choice of the potential @xmath146 for an actual gas and and the fact that the zeno lines are taken into account give us mercury isotherms in sec .",
    "3.5 .    as an example",
    ", we consider the lennard ",
    "jones potential , noting that , in our fundamental manipulations , the repulsive part of the potential does not play any role .",
    "the only essential quantity is the so - called effective radius @xmath232 , because it determines a one - dimensional elementary length .",
    "as is known , in the radially symmetric case , @xmath425    in the original scattered particles , we prescribe an energy @xmath275 and an impact parameter @xmath426 .",
    "the momentum @xmath97 , as well as the energy @xmath275 , is preserved .",
    "we also know that @xmath427 expressing the energy @xmath275 , we obtain for the attraction @xmath428 in the domain @xmath429 .    in the scattering problem , for the interaction potential , one considers the lennard ",
    "jones potential @xmath430 where @xmath167 stands for the energy at the well depth , @xmath232 for the effective radius , and @xmath431 for the distance between two particles with radius vectors  @xmath432 and  @xmath433 . in the two - particle problem , in the absence of external potential , the problem is reduced to a one - dimensional radially symmetric problem .",
    "in problem  , for different values of @xmath426 , there are other barriers and wells . at the stationary points @xmath434 and @xmath435 , the velocity vanishes , and thus these values can be evaluated by using the potential term only .",
    "we speak now of a pair of particles with the mass center which is caught by the trap ( rather than of a single particle ) .",
    "therefore , the difference @xmath436 is the very energy which is needed to knock out the pair ( dimer ) from the trap .",
    "after formation of a dimer at @xmath41 , one should consider the collision of a dimer with a monomer according to the same scheme , assuming that the pair - dimer ( a @xmath58-particle ) has already been formed .",
    "further , one considers the scattering problem already for the dimer at @xmath437 and a particle of the same mass @xmath55 .",
    "the successive consideration of such a multistep procedure leads to formation of a three - dimensional cluster , and we obtain a temperature significantly lower than  @xmath2 .",
    "it is important that the first step gives an upper bound , and this restriction is natural .    in an experiment , the percentage of dimers in gas can be calculated .",
    "it can be seen how dimers are created and how they are annihilated ( broken by monomers ) .",
    "after this , the average number of these events is calculated .",
    "the higher is the temperature , the higher is the average energy of the monomers , and the smaller is the number of dimers .",
    "the main point is that , under this approach , there are only two values , @xmath435 and @xmath434 , which are kept in the skeleton of the scattering problem ( cf .",
    "the skeleton of the amoeba in the tropical mathematics  @xcite ) . for @xmath438 ,",
    "the well disappears . for the attractive part of the lennard ",

    ", we can see that the average energy of the particles is equal to @xmath440 .",
    "the average energy is the temperature , and @xmath441 .",
    "above this temperature , there is no well . in thermodynamics , for physical reasons , this is the so - called boyle temperature @xmath1 . in our framework , the boyle temperature is defined as the temperature above which the dimers are practically absent .",
    "this is a new approach . according to this conception ,",
    "the boyle temperature for argon ( ar ) is @xmath442 and for krypton ( kr ) it is @xmath443 , while the tables of the experimental work  @xcite give @xmath444 for ar and @xmath445 for kr .",
    "the discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values is of the order of 23% .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath435 must correspond to the deepest well , i.e. , to the maximum value of the difference @xmath446 for all impact parameters @xmath426 .",
    "this difference determines the drop of the energy of a dimer after this dimer was captured by the `` trap , '' and thus determines the energy which a monomer must have to knock out the dimer from the well ( i.e. , for the dimer to collapse ) .",
    "the height of the barrier `` protects '' the created pair whose reduced mass was captured by the trap of `` dimers '' and `` clusters '' from `` shocks '' of monomers .",
    "as the temperature decreases , @xmath447 , the height of the barrier reduces , and , to survive , the clusters must create their own barrier in the form of a microanalog of the surface film .",
    "thus , a `` domain '' must occur , a three - dimensional cluster ( the so - called elementary cluster ) which has at least one particle which is protected by other particles .",

    "the scattering problem is considered for the lennard ",
    "jones potential , and therefore there is an additional parameter of length in the problem , the parameter @xmath232 , which is the effective radius .",

    "if we fix the distance between the particles and assume that the semiclassical parameter @xmath281 tends to zero , then the attractive potential vanishes .",
    "this means that , as @xmath415 , the distance between the particles decreases .",
    "it follows that the attractive potential acts between `` nearest neighbors '' only .",
    "therefore , it is natural to use the expansion of an attraction single - particle potential in powers of the radius @xmath423 up to @xmath452 only .    the `` dressed '' or thermal potential @xmath453 is attracting .",

[ [ the - law - of - preference - of - cluster - formation - over - passage - to - liquid - state ] ] the law of preference of cluster formation over passage to liquid state ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    `` the law of economic profitability '' asserts that at the same temperature @xmath163 , smaller than @xmath2 , gas particles tend to increase the number of degrees of freedom from the initial value @xmath546 up to @xmath238 , which is critical for the given temperature @xmath62 .    in economics , this preference should be understood as the preference of uniting ( associating ) over incurring debts . in thermodynamics",
    "it should be understood as preferring to form clusters over passing to the liquid state .",
    "it is easy to show that the correction to the bose ",
    "einstein distribution related to this law improves the coincidence of our theoretical isotherms with the isotherms coming from the vdw equation to such an extent that they are practically undistinguishable .",
    "the geometric locus of points where the phase transition gas to liquid occurs is known as the _ binodal_.",
    "the geometric locus of points where the tangent to the isotherm is perpendicular to the @xmath45 axis in the @xmath161 diagram is known as the _",
    "spinodal_.      the point @xmath545 which lies on the binodal , and at which three phases coexist : gas , liquid , and solid , is called the triple point .",
    "so this point lies on the binodal , and isotherms for temperatures lower than that point can not be observed experimentally ( see the picture appearing in  @xcite ) .",
    "a good agreement with the latest experimental values for nitrogen takes place for the isotherms from @xmath548 up to the point @xmath549 .",
    "the spinodal is the thick lower line ; it comes from the empirical model devised by the authors of the paper  @xcite .",
    "here we see a significant difference from the van - der - waals model . in the latter ,",
    "the spinodal is a quarter of an ellipse on the @xmath161 diagram which joins the points @xmath543 and @xmath550 .",
    "the tangency point of the isotherm with the spinodal is at the end point of the spinodal and is an accumulation point .",
    "let us define the poisson adiabat for fractional dimension . to do this , consider the limit as @xmath551 , i.e. , the case of the old ideal gas .",
    "we have @xmath552 @xmath553 on the @xmath554 diagram with @xmath64 as @xmath555 , we have @xmath556 therefore , @xmath557 we have calculated the angle at which the the gas isotherm issues from the point @xmath558 whose critical value of the compressibility factor is @xmath559 thus , we have obtained a generalization of the poisson adiabat to the case of a fractional number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the equation of the isotherm for a fixed value of @xmath560 is of the form @xmath561 where @xmath232 is the activity , @xmath562 , while @xmath563 is determined by using the coincidence of the relations @xmath564 with the spinodal constructed above . in this situation @xmath563",
    "is determined uniquely .",
    "the final main equations of the `` critical '' isotherms of a pure gas corresponding to the value @xmath514   will be @xmath573 for the vdw equation to which the ellipse passing through the points @xmath574 and @xmath575 corresponds , the coincidence of the isotherms is so precise that on the plot they are completely undistinguishable .",
    "as v.  s.  vorobiev has shown , if the law of preference stated above is not taken into account , the discrepancy with the experimental data for nitrogen are greater .    since , as @xmath576 , where @xmath577 is the triple point corresponding to a gas with the given value of @xmath514  , the isotherms become denser , it follows that the derivative of the spinodal with respect to @xmath45 on the @xmath0 diagram is zero .",
    "therefore , instead of ending on the line @xmath263 , the quarter of the ellipse terminates at the point @xmath578 with the corresponding value of @xmath579 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this uniquely determines the elliptic spinodal of the gas .",
    "consider a virtual gas whose critical temperature , denoted by @xmath580 , coincides with the temperature of the triple point of the given gas .",
    "let us consider two isotherms : the critical isotherm of the virtual gas and the isotherm of the given gas for @xmath581 .    from relation  , for a fixed @xmath563 with @xmath582",
    ", we can find @xmath544 ( the value of @xmath168 at the triple point ) .",
    "for known values of @xmath583 and @xmath579 , using formula ( 13 ) , we obtain the value of @xmath584 .",
    "thereby we find on the @xmath0 diagram the terminal point of the spinodal   at which the derivative of the quarter of the ellipse vanishes .",
    "we have found this by using the experimental values of the two endpoints of the quarter of the ellipse , which is our gas spinodal .",
    "thus , the positions of the _ critical point _ and the _ triple point _ ( well known from standard tables ) _ entirely determine _ the isotherms of the given gas .      as was already pointed out in the author s papers , it is more natural to pass from momenta  @xmath381 to energies @xmath585 and to generalize the problem of the transition of the energy @xmath586 to the energy @xmath587 , i.e. , to the hamiltonian containing repulsion .      here",
    "integration of the distribution corresponding to the number of particles must be performed with respect to the measure @xmath590 ( integration over angles is omitted ) .",
    "integration of the pressure distribution must be performed with respect to the measure @xmath591 over the three - dimensional volume  @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath592 , in order to determine @xmath563 , we use parastatistics in which @xmath58 varies from minus infinity to plus infinity . in this case",
    "the isotherm issued on the @xmath593 plane from the point @xmath594 comes to the line  @xmath475 for certain positive  @xmath58 .",
    "in the discrete case , for @xmath156 we have the law of reflection @xmath602 since the function @xmath603 is monotone decreasing , it follows that @xmath604 hence for @xmath71 the isochor  @xmath605 coincides with the isochor of the second sheet , corresponding to negative values of  @xmath168 ( i.e. second phase ) for @xmath240 and @xmath606 , so , that @xmath607 and @xmath71 .",

    "the bose condensate occurs and , consequently , for the liquid phase on the spinodal , the quantity @xmath611 remains constant on the liquid isotherm .",
    "this means that the isotherm of the liquid phase that corresponds to a temperature @xmath48 is given by @xmath612    all isotherms of the liquid phase ( including the critical isotherm at @xmath152 ) pass through the origin @xmath153 , @xmath154 and then fall into the negative region ( or to the second sheet ) .",
    "the point @xmath153 corresponds to the parameter @xmath155 , and hence to the continuation to @xmath156 , since , for @xmath71 , the pressure @xmath613 can be extended to @xmath160 .",
    "we shall see below that the value of @xmath49 as @xmath614 is also positive , and therefore the spinodal for @xmath160 gives another sheet on the diagram @xmath161 ( the second one ) ; it is more convenient to take this sheet onto the negative quadrant .    under the assumption that the transition to the liquid phase is not carried out for @xmath615 , we equate the chemical potentials @xmath58 and @xmath162 for the `` liquid '' and `` gaseous '' phase on the isotherm @xmath615 ( this fact is proved below ) .",
    "we can make the normalization of activity @xmath624 at the point @xmath234 , and we can find @xmath625 by matching the liquid and gaseous branches at @xmath234 for the pressure , in order to prevent the phase transition on the critical isotherm at @xmath626 .    in what follows , we normalize the activity for @xmath163 with respect to the value of @xmath233 computed below .",
    "then the chemical potentials ( in thermodynamics , the thermodynamic gibbs potentials for the liquid and gaseous branches ) coincide , and therefore there can be no phase transition `` gas - liquid '' at @xmath152 .",
