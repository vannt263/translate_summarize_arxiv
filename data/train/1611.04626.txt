    "relativistic outflows in the form of bipolar jets are an important means of carrying energy away from many accreting compact objects in astrophysics . such objects range from x - ray binaries of a few solar masses , to the bright central regions with black holes of millions of solar masses in some galaxies , known as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "blazars , an extreme sub - class of the agn family , are oriented such that one of the relativistic jets is pointed almost directly at the observer , resulting in a bright , point - like source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars typically exhibits two peaks in the @xmath1 representation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the lower - energy peak in the sed of blazars is commonly associated with synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons / positrons ( electrons hereafter ) in the jet .",
    "the higher - energy peak could be the result of inverse - compton scattering from the same electrons ( in leptonic models , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or of radiation from hadronic processes , e.g. @xmath2 decay ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , photopion processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or proton synchrotron emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the current instruments are usually unable to measure the broadband sed with the necessary energy coverage and time resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore variability plays a crucial role in distinguishing between these models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "blazars are variable emitters across all wavelengths over a wide range of timescales . on long timescales ( days to months ) , radio observations with high angular resolution",
    "have suggested a connection between knots with distinct polarization angles and outbursts of radio flux , sometimes with an optical and/or gamma - ray counterpart ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "correlated multiwavelength ( mwl ) variability studies are important for investigating the particles and magnetic field in the jets , as well as their spatial structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , in synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models for high - frequency - peaked bl lac objects ( hbls ) , x - ray and very - high - energy ( vhe ; 100  gev - 100  tev ) fluxes are highly correlated and most strongly variable when the electron injection rate changes .",
    "a general correlation between the x - ray and tev fluxes on longer timescales has been observed with no systematic lags .",
    "however , @xcite found `` an intriguing hint '' that the correlation between x - ray and tev fluxes may be different for variability with different timescales .",
    "specifically , the data suggest a roughly quadratic dependence of the vhe flux on the x - ray flux for timescales of hours , but a less steep , close to linear relationship , for timescales of days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on shorter timescales",
    ", blazar variability has been observed in both x - ray and gamma - ray bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "especially interesting are the fast tev flares with doubling times as short as a few minutes , the production mechanisms of which are even less well understood than the variability on longer timescales .",
    "one major obstacle to understanding such flares lies in the practical challenge in organizing simultaneous mwl observations on short timescales .",
    "firstly , it is difficult , if not impossible , to predict when a blazar will flare , due to the stochastic nature of its emission .",
    "secondly , it takes time to coordinate target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations with x - ray satellites and ground - based telescopes in response to a spontaneous flaring event .",
    "thirdly , most of the current x - ray satellites have relatively short orbital periods , and are frequently interrupted by earth occultation and the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passage , while observations from ground - based cherenkov telescopes may be affected by the weather , or precluded by daylight . these gaps in the observations",
    "increase the chances of missing a fast flare and introduce bias into timing analyses ( e.g. cross correlation and power spectrum ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ satellite has a long orbital period ( 48 hr ) , capable of providing observations of @xmath3  hr with no exposure gaps .",
    "it is therefore uniquely well - suited for monitoring and studying sub - hour variability , and is chosen as the primary x - ray instrument in this work .",
    "it is also worth noting that fast automated analyses of multi - wavelength data from tev gamma - ray blazars are done regularly , providing the potential to deploy too observations at short notice if a strong flare is detected from a blazar .",
    "spectral hysteresis and energy - dependent time lags observed in blazars have also provided unique insights into the different timescales associated with particle acceleration and energy loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can then be used to test different blazar models .",
    "however , such studies have been limited to x - ray observations , as a large number of photons are needed to provide a constraining result ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the increased sensitivity of the current generation of cherenkov telescopes , such us veritas and magic , has motivated the search of fast tev gamma - ray variability and hysteresis of blazars in this work .    within the framework of a 6-month long multi - instrument campaign , the magic telescopes observed on 2014 april 25 a vhe gamma - ray flux reaching eight times the flux above 300  gev of the crab nebula ( crab units , c.  u. ) from the tev blazar mrk 421 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is about 16 times brighter than usual .",
    "this triggered a joint too program by _ xmm - newton _",
    ", veritas , and magic .",
    "three , approximately 4-hour long , continuous and simultaneous observations in both x - ray and tev gamma - ray bands were carried out on apr 29 , may 1 , and may 3 , 2014 .",
    "this was the third time in eight years that mrk  421 triggered the joint too program .",
    "compared to the last two triggers in 2006 and 2008 @xcite , the source flux observed by veritas was significantly higher at 1 - 2.5 c.u . in 2014 . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the simultaneous veritas-_xmm - newton _ data obtained from the too observations in 2014 ( listed in table  [ mwlobs ] ) , and complement this study with other contemporaneous mwl observations ( including those of magic ) of mrk  421 .",
