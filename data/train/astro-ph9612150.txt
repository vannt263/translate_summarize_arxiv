    "the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains an enigma , even nearly 30 years after their discovery with the vela satellites in 1967 ( klebesadel et al .",
    "the bursts detected with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( cgro ) show that their positions are completely consistent with isotropy . for the subsample of 1005 grbs in the 3b batse catalogue",
    "the galactic dipole moment is within @xmath5 of the value expected for isotropy , and the observed galactic quadrupole moment deviates only @xmath6 ( briggs et al .",
    "1996 ) from isotropy .",
    "thus , grbs are distributed significantly more isotropic than any known galactic population and most of the galactic models are no longer in agreement with the data ( cf .  e.g.  briggs et al .",
    "1996 , hartmann et al .",
    "a spherical dark matter halo model could still be consistent with the measured burst positions , but requires a core radius larger than necessary to explain the galaxy s rotation curve ( hakkila et al .",
    "1994 ; caldwell & ostriker 1981 ; briggs et al .",
    "1996 ) . extended halo models",
    "have to place the typical batse grb farther away than about 100 kpc in order to obtain the measured isotropy . on the other hand",
    ", the observed bursts must be closer than about 350 kpc , because no excess of bursts is observed in the direction of m31 .",
    "neutron stars born with velocities exceeding the local galactic escape velocity have been proposed to match these requirements ( podsiadlowski 1995 ) , but in order to obtain isotropy of bursts , only a very small fraction of low - velocity neutron stars are allowed to burst in this model .",
    "moreover , a delayed turn - on is necessary to avoid a concentration of bursts to the galactic disk ( see e.g.  li & dermer 1992 ; briggs et al .",
    "1996 ) .    the alternative possibility",
    ", a burst location at cosmological distances , does not require to postulate additional restrictions ( paczyski 1986 ) .",
    "also , the observed inhomogeneity of the bursts radial distribution can be regarded as supportive evidence for this idea .",
    "the number of faint bursts shows a deficit with respect to the power law of slope @xmath7 of a homogeneous distribution in euclidean space ( schmidt et al .",
    "this can be explained naturally if faint bursts are located at high redshift ( paczyski 1991 ; dermer 1992 ; piran 1992 ) .",
    "there have been many attempts to estimate the redshift range of grb sources from their brightness distribution ( e.g. fenimore 1993b ; fenimore & blom 1995 ) .",
    "whereas a redshift of about 0.1 for the nearest bursts seems likely , only a very crude estimate of the redshift of the faintest bursts can be made ( @xmath8 through @xmath9 ) .",
    "apart from the uncertainty in the cosmological parameters , such studies suffer from the unknown evolution function of the burst sources and the corresponding emission rate ( see sect .",
    "4.1 ) as function of redshift ( rutledge et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the realization that gamma - ray measurements alone may be not sufficient to solve the grb mystery has prompted increasing attempts for counterpart searches of grbs at various wavelengths .",
    "two different methods are possible to search for grb counterparts :    * ( 1 ) * because of the typically large errors of burst positions and the huge number of quiescent objects within each grb error box , one method consists of simultaneous observations at other wavelengths ( x - ray , optical , ir , radio ) to search for transient sources during the grb event ( see recent reviews by hartmann 1995 , greiner 1995 ) . as a result of these studies ,",
    "there is solid evidence that gamma - ray bursts do not produce simultaneous optical flashes brighter than about 5@xmath10 mag for an assumed duration of 1 sec ( greiner 1996 ) or simultaneous radio emission stronger than 10@xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 ( cortiglioni 1981 ; inzani 1982 ) .",
    "* ( 2 ) * the second , more statistical approach is the search for positional coincidences of grb locations with comparison samples of any other known class of astronomical object .",
    "various types of catalogued objects , both galactic and extragalactic , were compared with the batse gamma - ray error boxes , but any correlation between these and the bursts was compatible with random expectation .",
    "( i ) webber et al .",
    "( 1995 ) looked for catalogued counterparts of 60 bursts with the smallest error boxes available ( @xmath14 ) and found no position coincidences above random expectation for extragalactic objects ( see , however , sect .",
    "5.2.2 . for our investigation of the latter sample ) .",
    "( ii ) gorosabel ( 1995 ) found no significant correlation between 44 grbs localized by the watch instrument to less than one square degree and objects ( galactic and extragalactic ) listed in 33 different catalogues .",
    "( iii ) extremely rare events in external galaxies , for example merging neutron stars , are one possibility to explain an extragalactic origin of grbs ( eichler 1989 ; paczyski 1991 ) .",
    "under such a hypothesis a correlation between burst positions and the large - scale structure of matter should be expected .",
    "the concentration of nearby galaxies towards the super - galactic plane offers the possibility to search for counterparts up to a redshift of @xmath15 .",
    "hartmann et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found no compelling evidence for a concentration of grbs to the super - galactic plane in the 3b catalogue .",
    "( iv ) with a likelihood method that compares the counts - in - cell distribution of gamma - ray bursts with the one expected from the known large - scale structure of the universe , quashnock ( 1996 ) argued that the nearest bursts originate at a redshift @xmath16 and the farthest ones at @xmath17 .",
    "( v ) however , searches for a correlation between grb and the direction of rich clusters of galaxies ( situated right in the above redshift range ) did not arrive at consistent results ( howard et al .",
    "1993 , nemiroff 1994 , deng et al .",
    "1995 , kolatt & piran 1996 , marani 1996 ) . from a comparison of the angular correlation functions of grbs and that of extragalactic radio sources",
    ", kurt & komberg ( 1995 ) concluded that gamma - ray bursts do not belong to a normal population of galaxies with @xmath18 .",
    "if we assume that grbs are emitted at cosmological distances and keep in mind that no clear correlation was found with either clusters of galaxies or the super - galactic plane then it seems unlikely that any normal constituents of galaxies can cause gamma - ray bursts . the most promising sources with a different nature are quasars and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "they had been suggested as grb sources by prilutski & usov ( 1975 ) shortly after the discovery of grbs ( klebesadel 1973 ) .",
    "both , the number of bursts with relatively small error boxes , and the number of identified agn and quasars are increasing permanently .",
    "webber et al .  (",
    "1995 ) used the 1989 version of the vron - cetty & vron compilation of qsos and agn .",
    "the fact that the number of known quasars and agn has doubled since then has motivated us to check their results with improved statistics .",
    "a further chance to find correlations arises if only a certain subclass of the agn or quasars are counterparts of grb . in that case",
    "the mean distance between the members of the sample will increase and the error of the gamma - ray burst position will play a less important role .",
    "we have therefore not only repeated the work of webber ( 1995 ) with larger samples , but extended the search for correlations to various subclasses of agn .",
    "our paper is arranged as follows . in the first part of sect .",
    "2 the grb sample and the methods used to search for correlations are introduced . in the second part",
    "we provide the samples of agns and quasars as well as different subclasses . our search for correlations between grbs and various subclasses",
    "is given in the first part of sect .",
    "in the second part we study in more detail those subclasses which show a positive correlation .",
    "the final results are described in sect . 4 and we elaborate on the one positive correlation found .",
    "finally , we discuss our results in the light of previous studies in sect . 5 and conclude with some remarks in sect .",
    "the 3b catalogue of grbs ( meegan 1996 ) provides the position of 1122 events , together with a statistical error , @xmath19 , which is defined by the formal covariance matrix from a @xmath20-test on the assumption of normal errors . the circle with this radius centered on the fitted position of the burst corresponds to the 68% confidence ellipse .",
    "this error is based on the poisson uncertainty in the batse measurement of the burst flux by each large area detector and is believed to have a gaussian distribution ( cf .  the description of the 3b catalogue ) .",
    "for many bursts the additional systematic error of 16 is larger than the formal error .",
    "its distribution is not very well known , but may have a more extended tail than a gaussian ( pendleton et al .",
    "combination of both errors results in a total error , @xmath21 , of @xmath22 which is an estimate of the 68% confidence interval for the burst location .    in order to test a given source sample of qso or agn (",
    "_ `` comparison sample '' _ in what follows ) for correlation with grbs we calculate the number of coincidences .",
    "a comparison with the number of correlations obtained for simulated burst positions allows us to estimate the significance of the correlations obtained for the real burst positions . to test for any bias introduced by either the distribution of grb positions or the non - homogeneous distribution of the comparison sample we will use three different methods .",
    "they differ in the way of calculating the number of coincidences and in the way the simulated burst positions are generated and are described in the next paragraphs .",
    "due to the uneven exposure of the sky the burst distribution is not isotropic .",
    "however , since the exposure map is primarily symmetric with respect to the ecliptic ( except the south atlantic anomaly ) , and the quasar distribution is asymmetric with respect to the galactic plane ( due to the search techniques ) , the affect on the coincidence statistics is negligible .",
    "we calculate the number of grbs containing at least one object of a given comparison sample within their 68% confidence interval . to reduce the noise all bursts which have a positional distance @xmath23 to a source in the comparison sample",
    "are counted only once .",
    "until now there are no reports on the presence of any large - scale structure ( like e.g.  dipole or higher moments ) in the grb distribution .",
    "therefore it appears reasonable to use randomly simulated control samples of grbs to obtain the number of chance coincidences , and their distribution .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that there is no ultimate proof for the assumption that randomly distributed positions reproduce the characteristics of the observed grb distribution . to estimate the significance of the correlation we simulate 1000 different sets of randomly distributed grbs and determine the corresponding number of coincidences , @xmath24 .",
    "the number of coincidences expected by chance , @xmath25 , is given by the mean over the 1000 values of @xmath24 .",
    "further , the one thousand values of c represent the distribution for coincidences between the comparison sample and simulated burst sample which ( by definition ) do not show any correlation ( null - hypothesis ) .",
    "this distribution will be used to apply statistics on the coincidences found for the real samples .    since every burst is counted only once",
    ", the maximum possible number of coincidences is equal to the number of grbs used .",
    "this method is justified since any observed burst can have only one counterpart . with this method of counting only once",
    ", the obtained number of coincidences depends both on the number of objects in the comparison sample as well as on their distribution on the sky , in particular their isotropy . in fig .",
    "1 the value @xmath25 is plotted against the size of the various comparison samples of qsos / agns we studied ( see sect . 3 for details ) . clearly , @xmath26 is not a linear function of the size of the comparison sample .",
    "a linear correlation holds for most of the samples with less than approximately 2000 members . for larger samples the @xmath25 values obtained are significantly lower than expected from a linear extrapolation of the smaller samples",
    "however , with the 1000 simulations of the grb positions we establish the distribution of the coincidences for a given sample .",
    "this enables us to obtain the corresponding probability for a real correlation of grbs with the respective comparison sample .",
    "the small - scale structure in the grb locations is more problematic than the large - scale structure .",
    "although no evidence for an autocorrelation in the 3b catalogue has been reported , a possible intrinsic correlation of grb positions can not be excluded at present , given their large positional uncertainties .",
    "rather than testing the 3b catalogue itself for the presence of small - scale structure , we will test our results using a method intrinsically robust against a possible hidden small - scale structure in the grb distribution .",
    "we applied the same method as in the previous section to calculate the number of coincidences .",
    "however , a different method to construct the simulated random positions was introduced to determine the number of chance coincidences .",
    "one thousand control samples were generated by changing the sign of the declination of the measured burst positions and shifting the right ascension 1000 times with a random number in the range between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the random samples constructed in such a way conserve the small - scale structure of the real grb distribution and allow to test its influence on the correlations .      by using the _ shifted grb sample _ we are able to test our results against a possible small - scale structure of the grb position distribution .",
    "because the qso / agn positions provided in the vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) compilation are not distributed homogeneously over the sky , we need a method which is robust against `` clustering '' of objects in the comparison samples .",
    "this is especially important as most of the `` clustering '' is due to the accumulation of objects in several deep small - area searches for agn and qsos . to this end",
    "we counted only bursts with a single qso or agn in their 1@xmath29 error circle . with this method",
    "we exclude every burst with two or more qso / agn counterparts , i.e.  too many to allow a direct comparison with the large error boxes of grbs .",
    "the expected background values and the corresponding expected distribution for an uncorrelated burst sample were obtained again with _ randomly simulated grb samples_.    the statistical errors of the grb positions range from 013 to 3415 . including the systematic error this results in a range from 161 to 3418 for the total error .",
    "the mean total error for all bursts is 52@xmath3041 , and the mean area of the error circles is 138 deg@xmath31 per burst .",
    "therefore , the sum of all 68% confidence error boxes of 3b bursts corresponds to more than three times the whole sky . in order to avoid too many spurious coincidences , we restricted our study to the bursts with small errors . in table 1",
    "we list the characteristics of the different grb samples used here .",
    "as mentioned above , both the statistical and total errors depend on the poisson uncertainty in the batse measurements .",
    "therefore , bursts with higher flux generally show smaller positional errors . in fig .",
    "2 the total error radii for 835 bursts are shown versus the burst flux in the 2050kev energy band . thus , restricting the bursts to those with a smaller error circle also restricts them to a higher flux range .",
    "if we search for positional coincidences of grbs with agns and quasars and thus assume that grbs originate at cosmological distances , then the restricted flux range may correspond to a restricted redshift range .",

    "this catalogue has been compiled from the available literature and provides the position of 11,662 sources drawn from 1662 references . due to several deep small - area searches for agn and qsos the objects in this compilation",
    "are not distributed homogeneously over the sky , but appear `` clustered '' in these areas .",
    "therefore , any test for a positional correlation between grbs and quasars or agn must be robust against observational bias inherent in the analyzed sample .",

    "in addition to the total quasar sample we consider three subsamples .",
    "the first is given by objects characterized by a high optical polarization , @xmath202% , which is mostly interpreted as evidence for synchrotron radiation connected with a doppler - boosted nuclear jet ( e.g.  wills et al .",
    "the other two classes are defined by their radio - loudness .",
    "although the radio energy band is far away from the gamma - ray band discussed here , these subsamples are justified because of the strong correlation found between the source properties in the radio and x - ray region .",
    "already einstein data showed a correlation between radio - loudness and both x - ray luminosity and x - ray spectral index ( wilkes & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "this result was confirmed by rosat measurements based on larger samples ( see e.g. schartel et al .",
    "in particular , the different spectral properties may indicate that the x - ray spectra are dominated by different physical mechanisms which may result in a different behavior at higher energies .",
    "we define the radio - loudness based on the radio - to - optical spectral index ( stocke et al .",
    "1985 ; kellermann et al .",
    "1989 )    @xmath203                      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the spectral fluxes are given in units of jy and v is the object s apparent visual magnitude .",

    "the radio - to - optical index has been k - corrected assuming a spectral index of @xmath204 in the radio range and @xmath205 in the optical regime .",
    "the radio fluxes and the visible magnitudes were taken from vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) . we define radio - loud quasars as those with @xmath206 .",
    "a source is defined to be radio - quiet if either @xmath207 or no radio flux is given in the catalogue .",
    "the vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) compilation provides 225 confirmed , probable or possible bl lac objects . in addition to the total sample and the sample restricted to the optically _ confirmed _ bl lacs we consider three further subsamples .",

    "this latter sample is dominated by bl lac objects which are strong x - ray emitters . for 66 of the 82 objects in this group",
    "the mere designation already indicates that they were discovered during x - ray missions .",
    "the vron - cetty & vron ( 1996 ) compilation lists 2833 agn . by definition of the authors ,",
    "all of them are fainter than absolute magnitude 23 .",
    "this sample includes sources with spectra classified as seyfert 1 , seyfert 2 or liners following the definition of heckman ( 1980 ) .",
    "further 97 sources are classified as probable or possible seyfert galaxies .",
    "the list of agn includes 116 galaxies with a nuclear hii region .",
    "these are now interpreted as a burst of star formation , but were called seyferts in the past and later were reclassified .",
    "therefore , we treat them separate from the seyferts here .",
    "we collect all objects without any morphological type assigned to them by vron - cetty and vron ( 1996 ) into a class we term `` active galaxies '' ( hereinafter ag ) .",
    "these typically consist of galaxies with nuclear radio or x - ray sources .",
    "note that we use the term `` agn '' only for the combined sample of seyfert galaxies and liners .",
    "we also divide the agn into radio - loud and radio - quiet samples , defined by their radio - to - optical index @xmath210 , in the same way as above for the quasars .",
    "in order to test our results if only for internal consistency , we compare the subsamples of qsos and agn defined above with three samples of grbs containing bursts up to a given positional error radius ( see table 1 ) . the results are listed in table 2 . for every comparison we give the expected chance coincidences @xmath25 derived from 1000 randomly simulated grb samples .",
    "further we characterize the distribution of @xmath24 by its standard deviation .",
    "since the distribution of coincidences is not gaussian , we also give the number of coincidences obtained with the real grb samples , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , together with the probability p to measure a lower value than the one obtained .",
    "histograms of the distribution of @xmath24 , i.e.  the number of coincidences for the artificial sets of grbs ( null hypothesis ) , are shown in fig . 3 for all analyzed subclasses .",
    "the expected value of coincidences ( or the mean of the distribution ) , @xmath25 , is shown as dotted line and the obtained value of real coincidences , @xmath211 is indicated by a dashed line .",
    "three classes , the `` active galaxies '' , all quasars and the radio - quiet quasars show coincidences in excess of the expected value at the 90%-level or more . since the radio - loud quasars alone do not show any excess coincidences , we conclude that only radio - quiet quasars may be related to grbs .",
    "all other classes are compatible with the null hypothesis of no relation with grbs .",
    "in particular , the highly - polarized and the radio - loud subsamples show no significant probability of being associated with grbs .",
    "only two classes , active galaxies and radio - quiet quasars show coincidences in excess of random expectation above the 95%-level .",
    "the sample sizes range from 71 to 7146 members and the mean distance to the nearest neighbour within a given sample varies from 04 to @xmath214 ( see table2 ) . in this section we will test whether any excess correlation may be influenced by the size of the comparison sample and/or the distance to the nearest neighbour .",
    "the expected number of chance coincidences was obtained by comparing the positions of the sources with randomly simulated positions of the grbs ( as explained in sect .",
    "2 ) . therefore ,",
    "our results are robust against large - scale structure in the burst locations .",
    "a possible influence of any small - scale structure in the burst locations remains to be checked .",

    "we should note here that a recent deep optical imaging ( vrba 1995 ) has revealed marginal evidence for a quasar excess at the rate of one per high galactic latitude grb error box .",
    "further studies able to distinguish between the different types of agn are certainly needed to clarify this situation .",
    "in addition , there are two probable kinds of quasars which are difficult to detect in optical , photometric searches .",
    "first , there are only a few quasars showing seyfert 2 type spectra .",
    "if the ratio of sy1/sy2 type spectrum quasars were equally large as the ratio of sy1/sy2 galaxies , then a large number of quasars will have been missed in optical studies .",
    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies discovered by iras ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) might be a second possibility to explain bursts lacking optical counterparts .",
    "these are suggested to be young quasars in a dust - enshrouded initial phase .      until quite recently radio - quiet quasars were thought to be associated mainly with spiral galaxies , and radio - loud ones with elliptical galaxies ( see bahcall et al .",
    "1995 for an overview of references to previous , apparently contradicting results ) . however , very recent deep images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ suggest that quasars reside in a wide variety of environments , not confirming the above preconception .",
    "if radio - quiet quasars are indeed equally likely to be associated with both spirals and ellipticals , then their clustering properties are difficult to predict . together with the reasonable assumption that grbs are an extremely rare phenomenon in the life of a galaxy , the lack of autocorrelation among grbs seems more natural .",
    "on the other hand , the production of grbs must be related to some specific property of the quasar , otherwise one would expect also a correlation of grbs with normal spirals , which is not observed . in the next section",
    "it is shown that the detected number of grb and the total number of quasars is in agreement with the emission rate determined in section 4.2 .",
    "because the number of spirals exceeds the number of quasars by a factor of order @xmath456 , our result argues strongly against a relation between grb and normal spirals .      in a friedmann universe with zero cosmological constant",
    "the luminosity distance d@xmath457 is defined as    @xmath458 \\right\\ } , \\ ] ]    whith @xmath459 the hubble constant , @xmath460 the deceleration parameter and @xmath461 the velocity of light .",
    "the comoving volume @xmath462 can be approximated by :    @xmath463    for @xmath464 this correspond to :    @xmath465    assuming @xmath466 mpc@xmath13 km s@xmath13 . from figure 2 in hewett",
    "1993 ) the cumulative space density of quasars @xmath467 for the optimized quasar sample can be estimated .",
    "assuming @xmath468 we get @xmath469 for the redshift range @xmath470 and @xmath471 for the redshift range @xmath472 , respectively .",
    "to derive the total number of quasars we further assumed that @xmath473 holds for redshifts below @xmath474 and that 15% of the quasars are radio - loud . under these assumptions",
    "we can estimate that in total 2.9 10@xmath475 quasars meet the criteria of the optimized quasar sample .",
    "the number of quasars studied , 967 , therefore corresponds to 3.4% of the total sample .",
    "this number has to be compared with the percentage of grbs cross - identified with a radio - quiet qso .",
    "according to table 8 we found counterparts to 12.5 grbs for a total sample of 134 bursts studied , or a detection rate of 9.3%@xmath302.8% .",
    "thus , the expected detection rate is within two sigma of the observed one , a reasonable agreement given the small number statistics .",
    "one should also be aware that there are two biasing effects which increase the rate of optical counterparts .",
    "the first is that more luminous quasars at a similar redshift show a higher probability to be detected in most kinds of surveys .",
    "our finding that more luminous quasars have a higher probability of being a grb counterpart suggest that the basic quasar sample used is already biased towards a higher rate of counterparts .",
    "a further bias towards a higher rate of counterparts is caused by the clustering of radio - quiet quasars ( shanks & boyle 1994 ) .",
    "because the clustering occurs on small scales it does not affect our results given the large error boxes of the grbs .",
    "on the other hand , unknown quasars show a higher probability to be located near to a known quasar in comparison to an arbitrary location on the sky .      merging neutron stars and black holes",
    "are one possibility to explain quasars as counterparts of grbs and are discussed in the first of the following subsections .",
    "there are not many publications explaining grb with emission by the active nucleus itself . because our result strongly suggests such a mechanism we show in a second subsection that the gamma - ray emission of radio - quiet quasars / agn can reach the energy range of grbs .",
    "finally , we discuss the model of leiter ( 1980 ) which may explain the observed correlation .",
    "an interesting scenario to explain grb from agn and quasars was proposed by epstein et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . because compact - star binaries have a higher mass than normal stars they settle to the center of the nuclear stellar cluster ( fraction of a parsec ) before they coalesce .",
    "the binary merging will typically occur in a time span of a second and will accelerate debris to very high velocities reaching almost the speed of light .",
    "the quiescent emission of the quasar nucleus is then up - scattered to the range of gamma - rays by this accelerated hot material ( debris ) , i.e. the spectrum is shifted by @xmath476 in photon energy and the flux is boosted by @xmath477 .",
    "the grb spectra and their light curves are therefore explained by the relative orientation between the observer , the beam direction of the emission of the active nucleus , and the path of the accelerated material .",
    "this scenario predicts that the spectra and variability of the grbs would be correlated with that of the host agn .",
    "already the heao-1 observations ( rothschild et al",
    ".  1983 ) revealed agn to show emission up to the 100kev energy range ( mainly from seyfert 1s ) .",
    "emission up to 100mev was detected from radio - loud quasars and bl lac objects , for which synchrotron emission is the favoured mechanism .",
    "however , no emission above 500kev was detected from radio - quiet agn or qsos with the three cgro instruments batse , comptel and osse ( schnfelder 1994 ) .",
    "it appears that two different mechanisms are at work in the high - energy band depending on the radio - loudness of the objects .",
    "the existence of two mechanisms is supported by the well - established difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos seen in x - rays ( cf e.g.  wilkes & elvis 1987 ; schartel et al .",
    "our result fits into this phenomenological picture , because we found grb counterparts only for radio - quiet quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum energy of photons from grbs reaches up to several gev and thus is significantly higher than the observed steady 500kev emission from radio - quiet agn and qsos .",
    "thus , there is a clear difference in the gamma - ray spectra of grbs and the steady emission of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "possibly , the miso and ariel 5 observations of ngc 4151 ( perotti et al .  1981 ) , a radio - quiet seyfert galaxy , may give some clues the understanding of our results .",
    "the flux above @xmath448500kev from ngc  4151 was found to be variable by a factor of 3 to 10 on a time scale up to 1 year as measured with ariel 5 in december 1976 , and miso in may 1977 and september 1979 . the observed @xmath282-ray fluxes are more than an order of magnitude higher than the limits reported from the osse / comptel monitoring of ngc  4151 ( schnfelder 1994 ) or any previous measurement .",
    "therefore , such a possible gamma - ray high state seems to be extremely rare .",
    "the variability by a factor of 3 to 10 in the @xmath3500kev range on a time scale of less than one year should be compared with a hard x - ray variability of only up to a factor of two ( perotti et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "one model to explain the variability found at the highest measured energies was suggested by leiter ( 1980 ) .",
    "if a massive ( m @xmath478 ) kerr black hole exists in the nucleus of ngc  4151 , then the penrose compton - scattering mechanism can lead to the production of @xmath282-rays with a cutoff at an energy of about 3 mev .",
    "the burst is triggered by sporadic injection of hot plasma caused by turbulence in the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "the resulting @xmath282-ray burst is emitted within an angle of 40 from the equatorial plane of the kerr black hole .",
    "the duration of such an event is given by the size of the target region divided by the speed of light which is located between the event horizon and the ergosphere .",
    "in most unified models it is usually assumed that radio - loud quasars contain a rotating black hole matching the criteria of leiter s simulations .",
    "but for radio - quiet quasars black holes without rotation are generally favoured . however , the accretion of matter through an accretion disk permanently transfers angular momentum to the black hole .",
    "the increasing angular momentum causes an increase of the ergosphere .",
    "finally , the ergosphere is larger than the event horizon creating a very small target region for penrose compton - scattering .",
    "further investigations have strengthened the possibility to produce grbs in hot tori around black holes ( jaroszynski 1996 ) .    if we assume that at least a part of the optical luminosity of the quasar is caused by turbulence in the accretion disk , then the positional coincidence we found between grb and intrinsically _ bright _ quasars can be explained with a higher injection rate of hot plasma and a higher transfer of angular momentum according to leiter s model . since particularly the x - ray emission of quasars",
    "is interpreted as a measure of the activity of the inner part of the accretion disk , a search for positional coincidences between _ x - ray bright _ , radio - quiet quasars and grbs would be most promising .",
    "it is interesting that the model proposed by leiter already predicts a focusing orthogonal to the angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "this may explain our negative result obtained for radio - loud quasars and bl lac objects if we assume that the radio - jet is emitted along the rotation axis .",
    "the aim of our study was to develop a method to handle the large error boxes of grbs and to study the positional coincidences with qsos and agn .",
    "we found the surprising result that the nearest and intrinsically brightest radio - quiet quasars have a probability of @xmath399.7% of being associated to the 134 best localized ( and thus in general brightest and nearest ) grbs of the 3b catalogue . while previous claims of correlations have usually been found spurious in light of improved ( and larger ) data samples , it is not the fact of the mere correlation which is surprising , but rather the high probability we find .",
    "if our results are confirmed in future studies with improved statistics then bright quasars emit @xmath282-ray bursts at an emission rate of @xmath479 bursts per year and quasar for the batse sensitivity limit , based on a comparison of the 134 brightest batse bursts with 967 quasars of an `` optimized quasar '' sample . in order to determine the energy emitted during a burst we consider only the 20 grbs with a single quasar in their error box . for 16 of them",
    "the fluxes are given in the 3b catalog , thus yielding a mean total emission of @xmath480 erg for the 2050kev band , of @xmath481 erg in the 50100kev band , and @xmath482 erg in the 100300kev range , respectively .",
    "an isotropic emission over @xmath483 @xmath484 was assumed and the following parameters were used : h@xmath485=50 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 , and @xmath486 assuming power law spectra with @xmath487 .    the deviation of the cumulative peak flux distribution of grbs from the 3/2 slope should then be used with caution to study the curvature of space - time , because quasars themselves show an intrinsic evolution .",
    "we neither wish to discuss the implications of our results on models , nor to build a theoretical scenario of grb emission from radio - quiet quasars .",
    "however , the brief review of the scenarios proposed by epstein ( 1993 ) and leiter ( 1980 ) shows that there are already theoretical ideas matching our findings , and ( in the case of leiter s scenario ) that phenomena related to neutron stars ( or stellar - sized compact objects ) are not the only possible explanation for grbs .",
    "also , the measurements of ngc  4151 provide evidence for emission from radio - quiet agn and qso in the energy range required for grbs .",
    "this implies that in the epstein ( 1993 ) scenario the boosting during the grb is rather moderate .",
    "thus , our finding of a positive correlation of grbs with radio - quiet agn combined with some previously suggested scenarios of cosmological grbs may provide a new avenue towards understanding the grb puzzle .",
