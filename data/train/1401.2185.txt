    "the power systems are undergoing drastic changes on both the supply side and the demand side . on the supply side , an increasing amount of renewable energy ( e.g. wind energy , solar energy ) is penetrating the power systems .",
    "the adoption of renewable energy reduces the environmental damage caused by conventional energy generation , but also introduces high fluctuation and uncertainty in energy generation on the supply side . to cope with this uncertainty in energy generation , the demand side is deploying various solutions ,",
    "one of which is the use of energy storage @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the optimal demand side management ( dsm ) strategy in the presence of energy storage , and the corresponding optimal economic dispatch strategy .",
    "specifically , we consider a power system consisting of energy generators on the supply side , an independent system operator ( iso ) that operates the system , and multiple aggregators and their customers on the demand side . on the supply side ,",
    "the iso receives energy purchase requests from the aggregators as well as reports of ( parameterized ) energy generation cost functions from the generators , and based on these , dispatches the energy generators and determines the unit energy prices . on the demand side ,",
    "the aggregators are located in different geographical areas and provide energy for residential customers ( e.g. households ) or for commercial customers ( e.g. an office building ) in the neighborhood . in the literature , the term `` dsm '' has been broadly used for different decision problems on the demand side . for example , some papers ( see @xcite@xcite for representative papers ) focus on the interaction between one aggregator and its customers , and refer to dsm as determining the power consumption schedules of the users .",
    "some papers @xcite@xcite focus on how multiple aggregators @xcite@xcite or a single aggregator @xcite@xcite purchases energy from the iso based on the energy consumption requests from their customers .",
    "our paper pertains to the second category of research works .",
    "the key feature that sets apart our paper from most existing works @xcite@xcite is that all the decision makers in the system are _",
    "foresighted_. each aggregator seeks to minimize its _ long - term _ cost , consisting of its operational cost of energy storage and its payment for energy purchase .",
    "in contrast , in most existing works @xcite@xcite , the aggregators are _ myopic _ and seek to minimizing their _ short - term _",
    "( e.g. one - day or even hourly ) cost . in the presence of energy storage ,",
    "foresighted dsm strategies can achieve much lower costs than myopic dsm strategies because the current decisions of the aggregators will affect their future costs .",
    "for example , an aggregator can purchase more energy from the iso than that requested from its customers , and store the unused energy in the energy storage for future use , if it anticipates that the future energy price will be high .",
    "hence , the current purchase from the aggregators will affect how much they will purchase in the future . in this case",
    ", it is optimal for the entities to make _ foresighted _ decisions , taking into account the impact of their current decisions on the future .",
    "since the aggregators deploy foresighted dsm strategies , it is also optimal for the iso to make foresighted economic dispatch , in order to minimize the _ long - term _ total cost of the system , consisting of the long - term cost of energy generation and the aggregators long - term operational cost .",
    "note that although some works @xcite@xcite assume that the aggregator is foresighted , they study the decision problem of a _ single _ aggregator and do not consider the economic dispatch problem of the iso .",
    "when there are multiple aggregators in the system ( which is the case in practice ) , this approach neglects the impact of aggregators decisions on each other , which leads to suboptimal solutions in terms of minimizing the total cost of the system .    when the iso and _ multiple _ aggregators make _ foresighted _ decisions , it is difficult to obtain the optimal foresighted strategies for two reasons",
    ". first , the information is decentralized .",
    "the total cost depends on the generation cost functions ( e.g. the speed of wind for wind energy generation , the amount of sunshine for solar energy generation , and so on ) , the status of the transmission lines ( e.g. the flow capacity of the transmission lines ) , the amount of electricity in the energy storage , and the demand from the customers , all of which may change due to supply and demand uncertainty .",
    "however , none of the entities knows all the above information : the iso knows only the generation cost functions and the status of the transmission lines , and each aggregator knows only the status of its own energy storage and the demand from its own customers .",
    "hence , the dsm strategy needs to be decentralized , such that each entity can make decisions solely based on its locally - available information .",
    "second , the aggregators are coupled in a complicated way that is unknown to them .",
    "specifically , each aggregator s purchase affects the prices , and thus the payments of the other aggregators .",
    "however , the price is determined by the iso based on the generation cost functions and the status of the transmission lines , neither of which is known to any aggregator .",
    "hence , each aggregator does not know how its purchase will influence the price , which makes it difficult for the aggregator to make the optimal decision .    to overcome the difficulty resulting from information decentralization and complicated coupling , we propose a decentralized dsm strategy based on conjectured prices . specifically , each aggregator makes decisions based on its conjectured price , and its local information on the status of its energy storage and the demand from its customers . in other words",
    ", each aggregator summarizes all the unavailable information into its conjectured price .",
    "note , however , that the price is determined based on the generation cost functions and the status of the transmission lines , which is only known to the iso .",
    "hence , the aggregators conjectured prices are determined by the iso .",
    "we propose a simple online algorithm for the iso to update the conjectured prices based on its local information , and prove that by using the algorithm , the iso obtains the optimal conjectured prices under which the aggregators ( foresighted ) best responses minimize the total cost of the system .",
    ".comparisons with related works on demand - side management . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we proposed a methodology to perform optimal foresighted dsm strategies that minimize the long - term total cost of the power system .",
    "we overcame the hurdles of information decentralization and complicated coupling in the system , by decoupling the entities decision problems using conjectured prices .",
    "we proposed an online algorithm for the iso to update the conjectured prices , such that the conjectured prices can converge to the optimal ones , based on which the entities make optimal decisions that minimize the long - term total cost .",
    "we prove that the proposed method can achieve the social optimum , and demonstrate through simulations that the proposed foresighted dsm significantly reduces the total cost compared to the optimal myopic dsm ( up to 60% reduction ) , and the foresighted dsm based on the lyapunov optimization framework ( up to 30% reduction ) .",
    "due to limited space , we give a detailed proof sketch .",
    "the proof consists of three key steps .",
    "first , we prove that by penalizing the constraints @xmath0 into the objective function , the decision problems of different entities can be decentralized .",
    "hence , we can derive optimal decentralized strategies for different entities under given lagrangian multipliers .",
    "then we prove that the update of lagrangian multipliers converges to the optimal ones under which there is no duality gap between the primal problem and the dual problem , due to the convexity assumptions made on the cost functions .",
    "finally , we validate the calculation of the conjectured prices .",
    "first , suppose that there is a central controller that knows everything about the system .",
    "then the optimal strategy to the design problem should result in a value function @xmath1 that satisfies the following bellman equation : for all @xmath2 , we have @xmath3    defining a lagrangian multiplier @xmath4 associated with the constraints @xmath5 , and penalizing the constraints on the objective function , we get the following bellman equation : @xmath6 \\right . \\\\ & & \\left",
    ". + \\delta \\cdot \\sum_{s_0^\\prime,\\bm{s}^\\prime } \\rho(s_0^\\prime,\\bm{s}^\\prime|s_0,\\bm{s},a_0,\\bm{a } ) v^{\\bm{\\lambda}}(s_0^\\prime,\\bm{s}^\\prime ) \\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following lemma , we can prove that can be decomposed .",
    "[ lemma : decompositionvaluefunction ] the optimal value function @xmath7 that solves can be decomposed as @xmath8 for all @xmath9 , where @xmath10 can be computed by entity @xmath11 locally by solving @xmath12 + \\delta \\cdot \\sum_{s_i^\\prime } \\rho_i(s_i^\\prime|s_i , a_i ) v_i^{\\bm{\\lambda}}(s_i^\\prime ) \\right\\ } \\end{array}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can be proved by the independence of different entities states and by the decomposition of the constraints @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , in a dc power flow model , the constraints @xmath0 are linear with respect to the actions @xmath13 . as a result",
    ", we can decompose the constraints as @xmath14 .",
    "we have proved that by penalizing the constraints @xmath0 using lagrangian multiplier @xmath15 , different entities can compute the optimal value function @xmath16 distributively .",
    "due to the convexity assumptions on the cost functions , we can show that the primal problem is convex .",
    "hence , there is no duality gap . in other words , at the optimal lagrangian multipliers @xmath17 , the corresponding value function @xmath18 is equal to the optimal value function @xmath19 of the primal problem .",
    "it is left to show that the update of lagrangian multipliers converge to the optimal ones .",
    "it is a well - known result in dynamic programming that @xmath20 is convex and piecewise linear in @xmath15 , and that the subgradient is @xmath0 .",
    "note that we use the sample mean of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , whose expectation is the true mean value of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . since @xmath0 is linear in @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the subgradient calculated based on the sample mean has the same mean value as the subgradient calculated based on the true mean values . in other words , the update is a stochastic subgradient descent method .",
    "it is well - known that when the stepsize @xmath23 , the stochastic subgradient descent will converge to the optimal @xmath24 .",
