    "in modern nonequilibrium statistical physics , the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) is significant to characterize the foundation of thermodynamic irreversibility  @xcite .",
    "ft has revealed that entropy production is directly related to the probability of the observed trajectory and that of its time - reversal .",
    "the entropy production is measured by observing the microscopic trajectories , which has been experimentally demonstrated in a variety of systems  @xcite .    in many nonequilibrium systems , however , we are not necessarily interested in all of the microscopic transitions .",
    "a prominent example is maxwell s demon , which is a composite system of an engine and a memory .",
    "the memory measures the state of the engine and performs feedback control on the engine .",
    "if we calculate the entropy production with the engine alone , the engine apparently violates the ft and the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , in many experimental situations with complicated artificial  @xcite and biological  @xcite nanomachines , we can not observe all of the transitions .",
    "if we observe only a part of transitions , we can not determine the total amount of entropy production .",
    "in such situations , is it still possible to obtain a universal nonequilibrium relation like ft ?    in this paper , we reveal the universal property of partially - masked nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all possible transitions between microscopic states , and @xmath1 be a subset of @xmath0 .",
    "we call transitions in @xmath1 as _ observed _ , and its complement as _ masked _ ( see fig .",
    "[ f : restrict - jump].(a ) ) .",
    "we then introduce a partial entropy production associated with @xmath1 .",
    "surprisingly , we can show that the integral ft holds for the partial entropy production , which is regarded as a novel generalization of ft .",
    "the concept of the partial entropy production is straightforwardly applicable to quite a broad class of nanomachines in thermal environment , such as autonomous maxwell s demons ( or bipartite sensing systems )  @xcite , molecular motors  @xcite , ion exchangers  @xcite , bacterial chemotaxis  @xcite , and single electron boxes  @xcite . in order to discuss the power of our result ,",
    "we show two applications .",
    "first , we apply it to autonomous demons  @xcite , which reveals the crucial role of mutual information at the level of stochastic trajectories .",
    "our approach reproduces the previous results on non - autonomous maxwell s demons as a special case  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we derive a new kind of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) for a pair of transitions .",
    "a thermodynamic system obeys continuous - time markov jump process for time interval @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the number of states of the system is finite .",
    "the transition ( i.e. , jump ) from state @xmath3 to state @xmath4 is written as @xmath5 , to which we assign transition probability @xmath6 that depends on time @xmath7 in general .",
    "the dynamics of the system is described by the master equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability of @xmath4 at time @xmath7 , and @xmath10 is the probability flux from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the system is attached with a single heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath11 . from the local detailed balance condition ,",
    "the heat absorbed by the system from the bath during transition @xmath5 at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath12    let @xmath13 be a realized trajectory of the dynamics , in which transitions occur @xmath14 times at @xmath15 .",
    "the state during time interval @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in particular , the initial and the final states are denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the total entropy production along trajectory @xmath13 is then given by @xmath22 where the stochastic entropy at time @xmath7 is given by @xmath23 , and its change is given by @xmath24 .",
    "first of all , we define the entropy production associated with a single path of @xmath25 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : single ] ) : @xmath26 the right - hand side ( rhs ) consists of the following two terms .",
    "first , @xmath27 is the heat absorbed by the system during transitions in @xmath28 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 takes @xmath31 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and takes @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "second , @xmath35 is the change in the stochastic entropy induced by the transition @xmath28 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 represents the state at time @xmath7 , and @xmath38 takes @xmath31 if @xmath39 and takes @xmath34 otherwise . the first term on the rhs in eq .",
    "represents the change in the stochastic entropy due to the realized jumps in @xmath28 : @xmath40 the second term on the rhs in eq .   represents the change in the stochastic entropy due to the time evolution of the probability distribution induced by transitions in @xmath28 .",
    "the sum of the second term on the rhs in eq",
    ".   for @xmath3 equals to the time differential of stochastic entropy : @xmath41    we can then show that the sum of the single - path entropy production for all paths recovers the total entropy production : @xmath42 which is a crucial property of the definition  ( [ observable ] ) . by summing up the single - path entropy production over a subset of all paths ,",
    "we define the partial entropy production with a subset @xmath43 ; @xmath44 where @xmath45 from eq .  , we can show that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a complement of @xmath1 .",
    "in general , if @xmath0 is divided into @xmath48 parts @xmath49 , then @xmath50 holds .",
    "therefore , our formalism enables additive decompositions of the total entropy production ; we call this property",
    "_ additivity_.",
    "we here discuss a simple example of the choice of @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ f : restrict - jump].(b ) shows an experimentally - realizable setup of a quantum dot with two electron baths ( the source and the drain )  @xcite . at most",
    "one electron is in the dot .",
    "electrons are provided from these two baths .",
    "in addition , there is a leak of electrons ; an electron sometimes escapes from the dot to the outside environment that is regarded as the third bath .",
    "suppose that we only observe transport of the electrons between the source and the dot .",
    "we set transitions associated with the source to @xmath1 , which is denoted by two bold red arrows in fig .",
    "[ f : restrict - jump].(b ) . note that we can not distinguish the transition associated with the drain from that associated with the leak , and",
    "thus we can not calculate the total entropy production from observed data .",
    "even in such a case , we can calculate the partial entropy production with @xmath1 .    in the above example",
    ", there is no backward process of the leak , and therefore , the total entropy production and the partial entropy production with @xmath47 are not well - defined .",
    "however , the partial entropy production with @xmath1 is still well - defined . in general , in order to define the partial entropy production with @xmath1 , we only assume that , for any @xmath51 with @xmath52 , the backward transition probability is also nonzero @xmath53 .",
    "we stress that it is highly nontrivial whether @xmath54 satisfies the integral ft .",
    "however , we indeed have that for any choice of @xmath1 @xmath55 which is the main result in this paper .",
    "we prove eq .",
    "( [ restrict ] ) as follows .",
    "we define another transition rate @xmath56 as @xmath57 with the modified escape rate @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the original escape rate of @xmath60 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath61 where @xmath62 takes @xmath31 if @xmath63 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "in addition , @xmath64 leads to @xmath65 by using eqs .  , , and , we arrive at our main result @xmath66    since eq .   is valid for any markov jump systems and any choice of @xmath1",
    ", we obtain many relations in specific situations by applying eq .  .",
    "in the following , we show two applications .",
    "one is to bipartite systems , which clarifies how information is used in autonomous measurement and feedback .",
    "the other gives a new fdt for a pair of transitions , in which the empirical measure fluctuation plays as an important role as the current fluctuation .",
    "s : demon    we consider a model of autonomous maxwell s demons , which is a simplification of models discussed in refs .",
    "we call the system autonomous when the transition rates are time - independent .",
    "suppose that a particle is transported between two particle baths : h with high density and l with low density ( see fig .",
    "[ f:4state ] ) . between the baths",
    ", there is a single site where at most a single particle can come in .",
    "let @xmath67 be the number of the particle in the site .",
    "in addition , we consider a wall that plays the role of the demon .",
    "the wall is inserted between the site and one of the baths .",
    "let @xmath68 be the position of the wall corresponding to left or right .",
    "if @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , the wall prohibits the jump of the particle between the site and the bath h ( l ) .",
    "the state of the total system is written as @xmath71 .",
    "correspondingly , we denote @xmath72 .",
    "we assume that the probability of @xmath69 is higher ( lower ) than @xmath73 if @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) . intuitively , the wall measures @xmath76 and then changes its own state depending on the measurement result , which enables the particles to move from l to h against the chemical potential difference .",
    "however , since the time intervals for measurement processes and that for feedback processes are not separated with each other , the previous results for non - autonomous demons  @xcite , in which the mutual information plays a crucial role , can not apply to autonomous cases . in more recent works , the role of the mutual information has been clarified for autonomous demons at the level of ensemble average  @xcite . here , by applying our general result , we will show that the mutual information also plays an important role in autonomous demons at the level of stochastic trajectories , as is the case for non - autonomous demons  @xcite .",
    "we introduce the entropy production associated with @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and the mutual information that quantifies the correlation between @xmath76 and @xmath78 .",
    "the stochastic mutual information between the particle and the wall is given by @xmath79  @xcite , whose ensemble average gives the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "the change in the mutual information associated with the dynamics of the particle is given by @xmath80 here , @xmath81 represents the change in the mutual information induced by jumps in @xmath76 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is kronecker delta . with notation @xmath84",
    ", @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 which represents the change in the mutual information induced by the time evolution of the probability distribution induced by transitions in @xmath76 . to confirm the meaning of @xmath85",
    ", we transform @xmath85 into another representation . by abbreviating @xmath87 to @xmath88 , the mutual information such as @xmath89 can be regarded as a function with three arguments @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .",
    "the time differential of mutual information is then written as @xmath94 it is easy to show that @xmath85 corresponds to the contribution to from the probability flux with @xmath76 : @xmath95 we note that @xmath96 is also rewritten as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is defined as @xmath99 defining @xmath100 in a similar way , we obtain @xmath101 here , the ensemble average of @xmath98 is equal to the dynamic information flow given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now apply eq . to this model .",
    "we set @xmath1 to transitions in @xmath76 ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) .",
    "then , @xmath103 describes the heat absorbed by the particles ( i.e. , @xmath104 ) .",
    "we also obtain @xmath105 and hence @xmath106 .",
    ".   reduces to @xmath107 in which mutual information contributes to ft on an equal footing with the entropy production associated with the particles .",
    "notably , for any bipartite system described as @xmath108 with time - dependent transition rates , eq .   holds with the same derivation . in this sense ,",
    "eq .   includes a previously - obtained ft for non - autonomous demons  @xcite as its particular case ( see appendix  [ app ] ) .",
    "thus , eq .   provides a unified view on autonomous and non - autonomous demons , where mutual information is a resource of the entropy decrease of a subsystem .    using jensen s inequality , eq",
    ".   leads to a second law - like inequality @xmath109 which implies that the entropy production rate of the particles is bounded by the mutual information flow .",
    "this inequality has also been obtained in refs .",
    "note that this inequality does not include any contribution from @xmath85 , because the ensemble average of @xmath85 is equal to zero .",
    "while the ensemble average of @xmath85 vanishes , this term is needed in eq .  .",
    "we explicitly show this point with numerical simulation . set the parameters @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and set the initial state at its stationary state .",
    "we obtain the probability distribution of @xmath115 ( blue ( light gray ) lines ) and that of @xmath116 ( red ( dark gray ) lines ) on @xmath117 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : f - graph].(a ) , the variance of the distribution of @xmath116 is larger than that of @xmath118 . since the tails of the distributions make significant contribution in eq .",
    ", @xmath119 deviates from unity as @xmath120 increases , whereas @xmath121 stays at unity in agreement with eq .  .",
    "by expanding our general result around equilibrium , we derive a new fdt for a pair of transitions .",
    "although the new fdt is general , we here discuss it with a specific example , a simple model of kinesin .",
    "the kinesin conveys an object by consuming the chemical fuel , atp , with five cyclic steps ( see fig .",
    "[ f : kinesin2 ] ) . in this simple model ,",
    "the kinesin is in equilibrium with stall force .",
    "if the applied force is slightly varied from the stall force , the kinesin is in a linearly nonequilibrium steady state with stationary current .",
    "we will show that the stationary current is characterized by the fluctuations in the equilibrium state .",
    "the perturbation on the transition @xmath25 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : kinesin2 ] ) is defined as @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the chemical potential difference coupled to reaction @xmath25 . if the change in the applied force is of order @xmath124",
    ", @xmath125 is also of order @xmath124 .",
    "we then introduce two key quantities .",
    "first , let @xmath126 be the empirical current from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "the ensemble average of the empirical current equals to the probability flux in the steady state with perturbation @xmath124 such that @xmath127 . here , we write @xmath128 as @xmath129 for simplicity .",
    "next , we define the degree of the fluctuation of the empirical measures for @xmath4 and @xmath3 as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the empirical measure at @xmath4 . the quantity @xmath132 indicates how the rate of the empirical measure between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , @xmath133 , differs from its ensemble average , @xmath134 . if the empirical measure is equal to the ensemble average , @xmath132 is equal to 0 .",
    "both the empirical current and the empirical measure are well - studied in the context of large deviation theory  @xcite .    by setting @xmath1 to the transitions @xmath135 , eq .",
    "is written as @xmath136 .",
    "note that @xmath125 and @xmath129 are of order @xmath124 .",
    "hence , the above equality is expanded as @xmath137 from @xmath138 and @xmath139 , eq .",
    "is transformed into @xmath140 where @xmath141 represents the ensemble average in the equilibrium state .",
    "since @xmath142 changes its sign for the time - reversal trajectory , and since in equilibrium a trajectory and its time reversal have the same probability , the cross - term of the rhs , @xmath143 , is equal to @xmath34 . substituting @xmath144 into and taking the equality up to @xmath145 order",
    ", we obtain a new fdt : @xmath146 here , since @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 represent the current fluctuation and the empirical measure fluctuation in the equilibrium state , respectively .",
    "the obtained fdt   connects the nonequilibrium stationary current @xmath129 and the two kinds of equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "in contrast to the usual fdt , the empirical measure fluctuation appears in this fdt .",
    "we note that the fluctuation of @xmath132 is significant in eq .  , while its ensemble average is zero .",
    "in addition , the condition that @xmath129 is real number leads to @xmath150 which implies that both of the current fluctuation and the empirical measure fluctuation can not be large at the same time .",
    "we have derived a novel ft for partially - masked nonequilibrium dynamics . applying the general result to specific situations",
    ", we can obtain both previous results  @xcite and new relations like eq .  , eq .  , and eq .  .",
    "equation   clarifies the role of mutual information in both autonomous and non - autonomous maxwell s demons .",
    "equations   and show novel features of equilibrium fluctuations with a pair of transition paths .",
    "the single - path entropy production is regarded as a building block to construct various thermodynamic relations for markov processes . although we treat only the markov jump processes in this paper , it is easy to extend our result to the markov chain and the langevin dynamics .",
    "we here make a remark on the relationship between our result and a previous work .",
    "although eq .",
    "looks similar to an equality obtained by hartich _",
    "et.al_. ( appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there is a crucial difference between their result and ours .",
    "their result is a special case of the following equality : @xmath151 where we assumed that , if @xmath152 is in @xmath1 ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath25 is also in @xmath1 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath153 in eq .",
    "is opposite to that in eq .  .",
    "therefore , the exponent of left - hand side in eq .",
    "does not satisfy the additivity , whereas the additivity is the crucial characterization of our approach .    the partial entropy production given in esq .   and",
    "satisfies both of the additivity and the fluctuation theorem .",
    "the additivity implies that the total entropy production can be decomposed into those of the subsets of transitions .",
    "the fluctuation theorem leads to a variety of new thermodynamic relations .",
    "therefore , our definition of the partial entropy production is a reasonable way to assign the entropy production to individual transitions .",
    "this approach would enhance our understanding of stochastic thermodynamics at the level of individual transition paths .",
    "for an instance , we have derived a new fdt for a pair of transition paths .",
    "another possible application of our framework is to biological molecular motors , which are regarded as small heat engines converting the fuel into work  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "for example , we would be able to reveal a bottleneck process in terms of the thermodynamic efficiency of motors , and its connection to the design principle of the molecular structure .",
    "authors thank sosuke ito and kyogo kawaguchi for fruitful discussion and useful comments .",
    "authors also thank jukka pekola for helpful suggestions .",
    "this work is supported by jsps kakenhi grant nos .",
    "25800217 and 22340114 .",
    "app    we reproduce the ft for non - autonomous maxwell s demons  @xcite from eq .  .",
    "we consider a bipartite system with state @xmath108 . intuitively , @xmath76 is the state of the engine and @xmath78 is the state of the memory of the demon .",
    "we assume that the transition rates satisfy @xmath154 with @xmath155 ( see also fig .",
    "[ f - supple ] ) . in other words ,",
    "only @xmath78 can change in time interval @xmath156 , where a measurement is performed by the demon ; the measurement outcome is registered in the memory . whereas , only @xmath76 can change in time interval @xmath157 , where feedback control is performed ; the engine evolves depending on the outcome registered in the memory .",
    "we apply eq .   to this situation and calculate @xmath96 . while @xmath96 is equal to zero for time interval @xmath156",
    ", @xmath158 holds for time interval @xmath157 , because the probability distribution @xmath87 changes only by transitions in @xmath76 during this time interval .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 for @xmath157 becomes @xmath159 we then transform eq .   into @xmath160 which is equivalent to the ft obtained in refs .",
