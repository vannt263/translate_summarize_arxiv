    "samples of dense bead packs ( @xmath23 g ) , are placed in a cylinder and held between two semi - permeable membranes ( one hydrophobic , one hydrophilic ) which each allow only the flow of one liquid .",
    "we use composite membranes of two parts , a thick porous material imparting mechanical stability ( both : porex , pore size 7 - 12@xmath5 m , height @xmath24 mm , hydrophobic : xs-96190 , hydrophilic : xs-96190 ) and a thin membrane with very small pores preventing the flow of the non - wetting fluid even at high pressures ( both : sartorius , pore size 0.45@xmath5 m height 115 - 145@xmath5 m ; hydrophobic : ptfe ; hydrophilic : nylon ) .",
    "they are held together using small magents ( supermagnete , @xmath25 = 3 mm , h = 1 mm , nickel coating ) .",
    "the cell body is made of brass , with an inner teflon tubing , of dimensions @xmath26 mm and h = @xmath27 mm with a total internal volume of 2.05 ml .",
    "our two immiscible liquids are hexadecane ( alfa aesar ) , which is filtered through a @xmath28 cm high alumina column to remove surfactants , and millipore water with interfacial tension ( ift ) @xmath29 = 51 mn / m  ( measured by pendant drop tensiometry ) .",
    "the experimental apparatus was designed from materials which do not leech surfactants .",
    "this was checked by measuring the interfacial tension of millipore water against hexadecane in which each component of the cell had been soaked and degassed for 24 hours .",
    "no significant changes in the ift were observed .",
    "we also check that the hydrophilic beads remain hydrophilic and the hydrophobic remain hydrophobic during the experiments , by running a two - layer sample test with uncoated hydrophilic beads at the top and hydrophobic beads at the bottom . after the experiment ,",
    "the beads were separated and their wettability checked by placing the beads in water .",
    "the hydrophobic beads continue to form large clusters and do not flow in the water .",
    "by contrast the hydrophilic beads continued to flow in water and did not form any clusters .",
    "this test showed that we do not have any leeking of the coating , as the one reported by @xcite .",
    "first , air is removed from the system by thoroughly degassing the membranes ( in the appropriate wetting liquid ) and the sample grains ( in oil ) .",
    "beads are loaded into the cell under oil , avoiding air , and the tubings are primed with fluid . in the middle of each tubing a 3-way valve ( hamilton hv3 ) is placed allowing removal of air bubbles .",
    "the top part of the cell and tubings ( polyether ether ketone ( peek ) , upchurch scientific , od @xmath30 inch , i d @xmath31 inch ) ) are filled with oil , connecting the hydrophobic membrane to the oil reservoir , a glass erlenmayer placed on an analytical balance ( denver scientific , 0.1 mg readout ) . to avoid force transmission to the balance",
    "the tubing is fixed below the air - oil interface .",
    "similarly , the bottom part of the cell , and the hydrophilic membrane are connected to a @xmath32 ml glass bottle open to air through a peek tubing ( 140 cm ) .",
    "both the water and oil reservoirs have large liquid - air interface ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath35 respectively ) , to ensure constant reservoir levels and negligible laplace pressure contribution .",
    "the zero reference pressure is obtained by measuring the oil saturation change , with cell only filled with oil ( no beads ) . at a set pressure all",
    "the oil is displaced from the cell by the invading water , and then again at the sample pressure the re - invading oil replaces the water .",
    "this pressure was used as the reference zero negating effects of the pressure drop across the tubings .",
    "the temperature is regulated at @xmath36c .",
    "+ the mass of oil displaced from the sample is measured as a function of time , and from the balance reading , and knowing the volume of the cell , the liquid composition inside the packing is calculated .",
    "the intial total oil mass inside the cell is @xmath37  0.65 g. the water pressure is set by vertically translating a water reservoir ( in steps of @xmath38 mm / @xmath39 mbar ) using a @xmath39 m high translation stage ( isel , germany ) .",
    "the scale and the translation stage are controlled using labview .",
    "the mass of oil ( calculated to water saturations ) are plotted at each height ( calculated to pressure ) of the water reservoir , giving the capillary pressure saturation curve .",
    "the pressure is gradually increased from -20 mbar to + 20 mbar and decreased back to -20 mbar ( with 1 mbar step ) .",
    "the pressure steps are applied when the saturation reaches a steady value , _",
    "i.e. _ when the standard deviation of the saturation is smaller than 0.5 mg during 200 s. lower thresholds , with longer counting times were also tested ( 0.5 mg/400 s and 0.5 mg/600s ) but showed no systematic variation .",
    "the resulting pressure ramp is one which changes rapidly when there is no , or little change in the liquid saturations and slowly in the regions of large change , greatly improving the efficiency of the measurement without compromising the accuracy .",
    "the reduced time scales allow each loop to be repeated 3 to 5 times in 1 to 2 days .",
    "the irreducible saturations of water and oil were extracted from each cps experiment are are here plotted against the correlation length in figure  [ final_saturations ] . the irreducible water and oil saturations are highly scattered , perhaps due to small sample size .",
    "investigations on the location of trapped oil ganglia in bead packs ( of a comparable sample size to our experiments ) revealed that very large percentages of the trapped phase ( including up to 99%)@xcite can remain trapped in a single ganglia .",
    "large ganglia are also the easiest to mobilise .",
    "therefore it is easy to imagine the large scatter , also within a single experiment can arise from mobilisation of just a few ganglia .",
    "x - ray tomography imaging of the fluid distributions at the irreducible water and oil saturations did not reveal any shape or size dependence of the trapped droplets on the matrix structure , so it is therefore not surprising that the irreducible saturations also appear independent of the correlation length .          because of the difficulty involved in characterising the wettability via contact angle measurements on a single bead , the wettability of the samples was instead measured by the capillary pressure saturation curves of homogeneous samples of each kind of treatment .",
    "figure  [ wettability_beads ] shows the imbibition curves for beads packs of homogeneously treated beads for gold , ctms and untreated glass beads .",
    "the glass beads spontaneously imbibe the water , that is the oil is displaced without applying any force to the invaded phase- allowing us to conclude they are water wetting .",
    "the treated beads , ctms and gold , show no spontaneous imbibition of water , and only at higher applied capillary pressures is water able to invade the bead packing .",
    "therefore , in the system that we are interested in measuring we know that the treated beads behave as oil wetting , and the untreated glass beads behave as water wetting .",
    "3d tomography data was collected using ge nanotom with a tungsten target and a resolution of @xmath41 m per voxel for the janus , mixed and cluster samples , and @xmath42 m for the patchy samples ( figure  [ cpsc_all ] ) , and 17@xmath5 m per voxel for the fluid morphology images ( figure  [ outlook_tomo ] ) .",
    "data was acquired using a current of @xmath43 and a voltage of 150  kv to achieve the best contrast between all phases in the system .",
    "1440 images were collected with an exposure time of 250  ms using 2x2 binning to give a reconstructed file size of 1132 x 1132 x 1152 pixels .",
    "image processing was performed using aviso - fire , a commercial software package designed for visualization and analysis of tomography data .",
    "recontructed tomography data was filtered using a bilateral filter and a unsharp masking filter , both of which are edge preserving , to reduce the noise",
    ". then segmentation of the image is performed by greyvalue thresholding .",
    "experiments for the imaging of the fluid - fluid distributions were performed in a peek ( polyether - ether - ketone ) replica of the cell , allowing transmission of x - rays through the the sample without degradation of the cell or release of contaminant molecules into the aliphatic phase .",
    "2 m ki@xmath44 is used instead of millipore water for x - ray contrast .    to obtain the liquid front voxels",
    ", the image is first segmented into three phases , oil , water and beads .",
    "the volume of segmented water is compared to the fluid saturations known from the mass balance measurements and is in agreement to a few percent .",
    "a label image of each segmented phase is made , identifying connected components using a 3d-26 voxel connectivity criteria ( vertex connectivity ) .",
    "the analysis tend to err towards including a droplet which is not actually connected rather than cutting it off from the main liquid body potentially overestimating the roughness of the interface on a microscopic scale .",
    "the largest connected water and oil regions ( connected to the membranes and liquid reservoirs ) are then dilated by 1 voxel ( expanded in along all edges by 1 voxel ) and the liquid front is defined as the overlapping voxels between the dilated water and oil regions .",
    "these overlapping voxels are used as the seed points for the shape descriptor as shown in figure  [ outlook_tomo ] .",
    "the correlation length of our samples are measured by image analysis of x - ray tomography of the dry samples . in this way",
    "we can obtain information about how we control the nature of the sample prior to exposure to two phases .    for the purpose of measuring the correlation length special samples",
    "were designed with spatial domains with x - ray contrast equal to the spatial wetting domains of the samples used for the wettability measurements . for the mixed and cluster samples basalt and glass beads",
    "were used to represent different wetrabilities of beads . for the janus sample analysis , gold sputtered beads with a thick layer of gold ( @xmath37 1 @xmath5 m compared to @xmath45 for the samples used in the cps experiments ) were used . for the patchy samples ,",
    "fully silver coated beads were wetted with 2% of the sample volume of noa ( norlands optical adhesive no .",

    "the remaining silver was then quantified using x - ray tomography , and the correlation length calculated from the same images ( fig .",
    "[ correlation_lengths ] ) .",
    "the images are segemented , using grey value thresholding , such that each wetting surface of the beads is seperately segmented .",

    "<S> the more compact fronts obtained when @xmath21 1 is therefore consistent with the increase of dissipation : dissipation is homogeneously distributed at the pore level which increases the width of the hysteresis loop .    ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller the collective volume the closer the initial seed points are together , and therefore the smoother the interface . </S>",
    "<S> inset : collective volume curves for a mixed sample at 50% water saturation for water invasion and oil invasion no difference in front morphology is observed . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) snapshots of the the liquid front for each sample type ( coarse grained with spheres @xmath22    we argue that this effect is a sign of the suppression of collective effects in the bead pack which otherwise favours filling and emptying of successive pores as observed under dynamic conditions for haines jumps  @xcite . in other words , the spatial distribution of surface energies , and not just the pore - throat geometry determine the ability of the invading phase to invade a pore along the liqiud front .    _ </S>",
