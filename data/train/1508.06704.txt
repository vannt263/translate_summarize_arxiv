    "shape dynamics is a classical theory of gravity that shares many features in common with the canonical formulation of general relativity due to arnowitt deser and misner @xcite , and which makes identical predictions about the outcomes of the experiments which have confirmed general relativity to date .",
    "originally @xcite , shape dynamics was viewed as a reformulation of canonical general relativity that traded the ( on - shell ) refoliation invariance generated by the quadratic hamiltonian constraint for spatial weyl invariance generated by a new linear weyl constraint .",
    "the theories were quickly seen to agree for a broad class of known solutions to general relativity  particularly those admitting globally defined foliations by spatial hypersurfaces of constant mean extrinsic curvature .",
    "however , questions remained about what the corresponding solutions of shape dynamics would look like for space - times that admitted such foliations only locally , or whether it was even possible for shape dynamics to describe such systems .",
    "a partial answer to this question was provided by @xcite and @xcite , in which spherically symmetric and rotating asymptotically flat black hole solutions of shape dynamics were presented .",
    "these novel solutions were shown to agree with their general relativistic counterparts outside their event horizons , but behave differently in their interior regions .",
    "both solutions possess an inversion symmetry about their event horizons , which implies that the interior regions should be interpreted as a time - reversed copy of the exterior regions , endowing the solutions with the character of a _",
    "wormhole_. i will show in the following sections that these features are not peculiar to event horizons , but arise naturally in solutions of shape dynamics with other types of horizons as well .",
    "i analyze the properties of these horizons and show that all of them are parity horizons , which are defined in section [ sdbh ] .    one way to understand the disagreement between shape dynamics and general relativity when solutions develop horizons is to note that in the canonical formalism , many types of horizons arise when the lapse function either vanishes or diverges . since",
    "the determinant of the spacetime metric can be written @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the determinant of the spatial metric and @xmath2 is the lapse function , it is clear that on a horizon , the determinants of the spatial and space - time metrics can not simultaneously be finite and non - zero ",
    "one must choose between a smooth space - time and a smooth conformal spatial geometry .    with the benefit of hindsight , it is not particularly surprising that shape dynamics and general relativity disagree when solutions of either develop horizons , however it is still interesting to consider the particular ways in which the theories disagree in the presence of such surfaces .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", i will review the known asymptotically flat black hole solutions for shape dynamics and discuss their properties . in section [ charge ] , i introduce a spherically symmetric , charged black hole solution for shape dynamics analogous to the reissner - nrdstrom black hole of general relativity , and discuss the properties of the solution . in section [ rindler ] , i discuss the rindler chart over minkowski space - time and introduce a new solution of shape dynamics which shares many of the same features .",
    "i will discuss how this new solution differs from its general relativistic counterpart and emphasize the crucial role played by the boundary conditions in shape dynamics . in section [ bonner",
    "] , i briefly review closed time - like curves and discuss a family of solutions to einstein s equations known as the van stockum - bonner space - times , which except for the lowest order case , are stationary , asymptotically flat and possess a compact cauchy horizon within which closed time - like curves pass through every point .",
    "i will then present a novel solution of shape dynamics which agrees with the next - to - lowest order bonner space - time outside the horizon , but which does not develop closed time - like curves within  the cauchy horizon is replaced by a parity horizon in the shape dynamics solution .",
    "i argue that this is evidence of a general chronology protection mechanism in shape dynamics that is significantly more parsimonious than many of the arguments that have been made for chronology protection in general relativity .      before continuing to the main results ,",
    "it is worthwhile to review the construction of shape dynamics for asymptotically flat spatial manifolds presented in @xcite and elaborated in @xcite .",
    "one begins with the standard canonical formulation of general relativity .",

    "together with the new first class constraint @xmath21 , the addition of these new canonical variables trivially embeds canonical general relativity into the extended phase space @xmath22 .    to obtain a non - trivial embedding ,",
    "one then performs the canonical transformation    @xmath23    the hamiltonian for the extended phase space can be written in terms of the canonically transformed first class constraints :    @xmath24 + t_{\\phi}b(n,\\xi)\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the lapse function , @xmath26 is the shift vector and @xmath27 is a lagrange multiplier for the weyl constraint @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the gibbons - hawking - york boundary term ( the surface integral in ) , and @xmath30 plays an important role in defining the globally conserved charges in shape dynamics @xcite .",
    "the system described by this hamiltonian is known as the _ linking theory _ , as it provides a link between canonical general relativity and shape dynamics @xcite . in order to obtain shape dynamics from the linking theory ,",
    "one imposes the gauge fixing condition @xmath31 . the only constraint whose poisson bracket with the gauge - fixing condition @xmath31 is weakly non - vanishing is @xmath32 :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is scalar constraint smeared with the lapse function @xmath25 , and @xmath35 .",

    ". of the remaining first class constraints , @xmath39 generates time reparametrizations , @xmath41 generates diffeomorphisms acting on the conformal spatial metric and it conjugate momentum , and @xmath40 generates spatial weyl transformations .",
    "shape dynamics admits a birkhoff theorem @xcite . the unique spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat solution to the shape dynamics equations of motion can be described globally by the schwarzschild line element in isotropic",
    "coordinates :    @xmath44    this line element is a solution of the einstein field equations _ only _ for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the location of the event horizon in isotropic coordinates , whereas this solution is valid _ everywhere _ from the point of view of shape dynamics .",
    "the line element is invariant under the transformation @xmath47 .",

    "in fact , this solution is completely free of physical singularities , which from the point of view of shape dynamics means that there are no singularities in the spatial conformal geometry .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the cotton tensor .",
    "the cotton tensor possesses all of the local information on the conformal structure of a three dimensional reimannian manifold just as the weyl tensor contains all of the local information on the conformal structure of higher dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "] vanishes identically , which follows from the fact that the spatial metric is conformally flat .",
    "this solution can be understood in relation to the maximally extended kruskal space - time by considering the conformal diagram of the latter .",
    "the conformal diagram of the kruskal space - time contains four regions , with two causally disconnected regions each with their own spatial infinity , one region containing a past singularity and one containing a future singularity . on the other hand",
    ", the conformal diagram of the spherically symmetric shape dynamic black hole contains only the two regions connected to ( two copies of ) spatial infinity identified along the black hole horizon .",
    "these regions are therefore no longer causally disconnected , and observers can pass in one direction across the horizon from the `` exterior '' region to the `` interior . ''",
    "the regions containing the past and future singularities are absent in the shape dynamics case , reflecting the global regularity of the solution .",

    "let us now consider another shape dynamic black hole solution whose event horizon is a parity horizon .",

    "the location of the horizon in these coordinates is @xmath62 and the transformation @xmath63 leaves the line element is invariant , so this solution also possesses a parity about the horizon .",
    "in addition to avoiding the ring curvature singularity that is present in the interior of the kerr spacetime , this solution also avoids the closed time - like curves present in that region .",
    "since shape dynamics also has a preferred time variable , it is natural to wonder if it is a general feature of solutions of shape dynamics that closed timelike curves do not occur",
    ". this may indeed be the case , and in section [ bonner ] i will show that this is true for another solution of shape dynamics whose general relativistic counterpart contains closed timelike curves but possesses no event horizon .",
    "i will argue based on the generic features of this solution that chronology protection may be a general feature of the theory .    in the following section , i introduce a charged black hole solution for shape dynamics analogous to the reissner - nrdstrom black hole in general relativity .",
    "it is shown that the event horizon is again a parity horizon and that the parity about the horizon leads to a fully cpt invariant solution .",
    "to address the question of whether charged shape dynamic black holes possess some notion of cpt invariance , one must first couple the linking theory to the electromagnetic field and perform a phase space reduction to obtain shape dynamics coupled to electromagnetism @xcite . the hamiltonian density for electromagnetism is given by    @xmath64}a_{[k , l]}q^{ik}q^{jl}\\sqrt{q } + \\frac{\\tilde{e}^i\\tilde{e}^jq_{ij}}{\\sqrt{q}}\\right)\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 is the vector potential and @xmath66 is its canonically conjugate momentum .",

    "coupling electromagnetism to general relativity yields the system of constraints :    @xmath69    the next step is to extend the phase space and perform the canonical transformation of the constraints . before proceeding , one must determine how @xmath65 and @xmath67 transform under the canonical transformation @xmath70 .",
    "here it is assumed as in @xcite , that @xmath65 and @xmath67 transform trivially under @xmath70 so that one can retain a system of first class constraints with well - defined global charges . with this additional assumption ,",
    "the transformed coupled scalar constraint becomes    @xmath71    where @xmath72 . imposing the gauge - fixing condition @xmath73 one obtains the coupled second class constraint    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is now once again viewed as a first class constraint generating spatial weyl transformations .",
    "as in the uncoupled case , one can also derive a consistency condition that fixes the lapse function :    @xmath76    in order to find a simple solution to the coupled constraints , we consider spherically symmetric conformal initial data which trivially satisfy the coupled first class constraints if we choose @xmath77 :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is the flat spatial metric written in spherical coordinates , and the barred quantities are arbitrarily rescaled according to their conformal weight by a conformal factor @xmath80 which is to be determined by solving .",
    "note that the chosen initial data is static and spherically symmetric , so the equations of motion are trivial , and that the spherically symmetric eletric field @xmath81 is just the coulomb electric field in the flat background defined by @xmath82 .    since",
    "the conformal initial data is written in terms of the flat spatial metric @xmath79 , the scalar curvature @xmath37 vanishes , and becomes simply    @xmath83    putting into gives an explicit expression for @xmath84 which can be substituted into to give    @xmath85    where i have also used spherical symmetry to assume that @xmath80 depends only on @xmath86 and primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "equation is difficult to solve in its present form , but it can be simplified by making the substitution @xmath87 , which yields    @xmath88    now equation can be solved by making the laurent series ansatz :    @xmath89    the derivatives of @xmath90 can be easily calculted from :    @xmath91    inserting and back into yields the infinite double sum :    @xmath92 r^{-(2 + m + n ) } = -\\frac{2q}{r^4}.\\ ] ]    in order for to be satisfied to all orders , all terms for which @xmath93 on the left - hand side must vanish .",
    "this implies that @xmath94 for @xmath95 , which means that the series terminates .",
    "collecting the terms proportional to @xmath96 on the left hand side gives :    @xmath97    imposing the generic boundary conditions @xmath98 , @xmath99 , equation can be solved for @xmath100 in terms of the mass @xmath101 and electric charge @xmath102 :    @xmath103    inserting equation back into equation and recalling that @xmath94 for @xmath95 :    @xmath104    putting equations and into , one obtains the homogenous , linear , second order ordinary differential equation :    @xmath105    which given asymptotically flat boundary conditions , has the unique solution :    @xmath106    rescaling the conformal initial data by the appropriate powers of @xmath80 according to their conformal weights gives the spatial metric and physical electric field :    @xmath107    the reconstructed line - element associated with this solution of shape dynamics is given by    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the metric on the unit two - sphere .",
    "equation is just the line element of the reissner - nrdstrom black hole written in isotropic coordinates , which is well known in the context of general relativity , and has been derived by similar methods in for example @xcite .",
    "the physical difference between this shape dynamics solution and the reissner - nrdstrom black hole is once again that the shape dynamics solution has a wormhole character manifested by the presence of a parity horizon .",
    "the event horizon of this black hole solution is located at @xmath110 where the lapse vanishes . in the limit @xmath111 ,",
    "one recovers the uncharged spherically symmetric shape dynamic black hole and the location of the horizon reduces to @xmath112 . just as in the uncharged spherically symmetric black hole ,",
    "the spatial metric is invariant under the parity @xmath113 , while the lapse changes sign under this tranformation .",
    "thus , the surface @xmath114 is a parity horizon .",
    "it is interesting to consider how the electric field @xmath115 transforms under parity .",
    "one can check that    @xmath116    so the electric field transforms like a vector under parity and transforms trivially under time reversal @xmath117 .",
    "the lapse changes sign under time - reversal , which can be seen by noting that n can be defined through the linking theory as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the unit normal to the maximal space - like hypersuface of constant @xmath120 .",
    "finally , the electric field changes sign under charge conjugation @xmath121 while the spatial metric and lapse are invariant under this transformation . putting all this together",
    ", it is clear that the charged spherically symmetric shape dynamic black hole solution derived above is fully cpt invariant .",
    "it is worth noting that while the uncharged spherically symmetric shape dynamic black hole is fully ( c)pt invariant , the rotating solution is not .",
    "it is easy to see that while the parity preserves the spatial metric and changes the sign of the lapse , the shift vector transforms like a pseudo - vector under parity while it changes sign under time - reversal .",
    "thus , the combination of parity and time - reversal has the effect of changing the sign of the angular momentum .",
    "however , one can still recover pt invariance of the rotating shape dynamic black hole as an asymptotic symmetry which is approximate in the bulk but becomes exact on the horizon .",
    "this can be done by noting that the space - time coordinate tranformation @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the angular velocity of the horizon measured at spatial infinity , preserves the weyl constraint and is thus a residual gauge symmetry inherited from the linking theory .",
    "the effect of this transformation is that the new time coordinate @xmath124 is defined so that its associated coordinate derivative @xmath125 is the stationarity killing vector defining the bifurcate killing horizon of the reconstructed space - time . in terms of this adapted time coordinate , becomes :    @xmath126 ^ 2 + \\lambda \\left[m^2e^{2\\gamma}(d\\mu^2 + d\\theta^2 ) + s^2d\\phi^2\\right].\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that in these coordinates the shift vector vanishes on the horizon , and the time reversal @xmath127 combined with the parity @xmath63 is an asymptotic symmetry of the horizon . in the static cases , there is no difference between t and @xmath124 since the angular velocity of the horizon is zero .",
    "this suggests that in defining time - reversal for stationary shape dynamic black holes , one should take @xmath127 rather than @xmath117 .",
    "based upon these considerations , one would expect that a kerr - newman - like shape dynamic black hole would possess an asymptotic cpt invariance that becomes exact on the horizon , but this is left for future work .",
    "next i will show that rindler space can be viewed as a solution of shape dynamics and that the rindler horizon is also a parity horizon .",
    "the rindler chart represents a congruence of uniformly accelerating observers over a portion of the minkowski space - time .",
    "it is of particular interest because despite the fact that it is related to ordinary cartesian coordinates in flat space - time by a space - time coordinate transformation , the rindler chart contains an observer - dependent horizon which has a non - zero surface gravity , and hence a non - zero temperature , much like the event horizon of a black hole .",
    "this is a physical effect : if one considers a klein - gordon field propagating in minkowski space , one can identify the vacuum state with respect to inertial observers , but this state is not a vacuum with respect to accelerated observers  rather accelerated observers see a thermal bath of excitations of the klein gordon field with temperature equal to @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the surface gravity of the rindler horizon @xcite .",
    "this is entirely analogous to what happens when one considers a scalar field in a black hole background initial asymptotic vacuum states are not final asymptotic vacuum states , and the result is that the black hole creates particles in the form of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "the fact that accelerated observers in flat space - time observe a thermal bath is known as the ",
    "unruh effect . \"    in order to construct the rindler chart , one can begin with cartesian coordinates over minkowski spacetime .",
    "the line element is simply :    @xmath130    if one then introduces the coordinate transformation    @xmath131    one obtains the rindler chart with the line element    @xmath132    the congruence of uniformly accelerating observers see a horizon located at @xmath133 , which can be seen by noting the time - time component of the metric goes to zero there .",
    "it is worth noting that the coordinate transformation defines @xmath134 only for @xmath135 .",
    "for this reason , the chart is often called the ",
    "right rindler wedge , \" and the left wedge must be defined separately with @xmath134 defined to have the opposite sign . since this solution was obtained by performing a coordinate transformation that mixes space and time , it is not obvious that it is physically equivalent to the minkowski space - time from the point of view of shape dynamics ; space - time diffeomorphisms are not a gauge symmetry of shape dynamics , only spatial diffeomorphisms and spatial weyl transformations are .",
    "note however , that this coordinate transformation preserves the weyl constraint , so rindler space should indeed be a solution of shape dynamics .",
    "next , i will show how rindler space can be derived as a solution of shape dynamics from first principles .      as mentioned earlier , shape dynamics trades the refoliation invariance generated by the hamiltonian constraint of general relativity for spatial weyl invariance generated by a new weyl constraint .",
    "one consequence of this symmetry trading is that the lapse function is not a lagrange multiplier in shape dynamics , but must instead satisfy the lapse - fixing equation , which is reproduced below for convenience .    @xmath136    now choose the flat initial data @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and choose the gauge @xmath139 , so that the spatial slices in the reconstructed space - time are flat , as opposed to conformally flat as they are in the spherically symmetric black hole cases . if the shift vector is chosen to be zero , then the reconstructed line - element associated with this solution of shape dynamics will have the form :    @xmath140    in this simple case , the lapse - fixing equation reduces to laplace s equation , @xmath141 .",
    "the general solution of the lapse - fixing equation for this initial data is now trivially given by the harmonic functions .",
    "in spherical coordinates , this yields :    @xmath142    where @xmath143 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "first , consider asymptotically flat boundary conditions @xmath144 and @xmath145 , where the latter condition essentially imposes that the total energy of the solution is zero .",
    "obviously , the only way that the first boundary condition can be satisfied is if @xmath146 , so the solution becomes    @xmath147    but @xmath148 is just a constant , and the second boundary condition imply that @xmath149 putting this together , we have @xmath150 , and since @xmath151 , this means @xmath152 everywhere . switching back to cartesian coordinates , one obtains the minkowski line element : @xmath153    on the other hand , one can consider cartesian spatial coordinates , and demand that @xmath154 , @xmath155 , where @xmath129 is a constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that this problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding the electric potential ( for @xmath156 ) due to an infinite plane of surface charge at @xmath133 , so one can more or less guess the solution @xmath157 , where is @xmath158 is some constant playing the role of the electric field .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that the constant playing the role of the electric field is exactly @xmath129 , and this is carried out in the appendix for the sake of completeness .",
    "the reconstructed line element has the form of the minkowski space - time written in rindler coordinates :    @xmath159    it is not terribly surprising that non - inertial observers can be obtained by changing the boundary conditions on the lapse ; eulerian observers are generally non - inertial , with their proper acceleration given by @xmath160 . what is more surprising is that the space - time reconstructions obtained from these different boundary conditions on the lapse are related by a space - time diffeomorphism .",
    "the fact that this is a _ residual _ gauge transformation from the point of view of shape dynamics may shed some light on the fact that the accelerated eulerian observers associated with the rindler chart observe physically different effects than their non - accelerated counterparts in the usual cartesian minkowski chart they observe a thermal bath of unruh radiation .",
    "residual space - time coordinate invariance in shape dynamics was partially explored in @xcite , but it is still not completely understood what role these tranformations play in the theory . from the point of view of shape dynamics , these symmetries , which as in the present case may be disconnected from the identity , seem somewhat less fundamental than the gauge transformations generated by the first class constraints which make no reference to any properties of particular solutions , and are pure - gauge even off - shell .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that while at a glance the line elements seem to agree , the rindler chart is a complete solution from the point of view of shape dynamics .",
    "that is , the coordinate @xmath134 is well defined for all real values and therefore covers both the right and left wedges . as a solution of shape dynamics ,",
    "the rindler chart is therefore globally different the from corresponding solution of general relativity where it is defined only for the right and left wedges separately , and globally also includes future and past wedges that are not present in the shape dynamics solution .",
    "these global differences are entirely analogous to those found when comparing the black hole solutions of shape dynamics and general relativity , but in the case of the rindler chart , there is no event horizon .",
    "it can be easily seen that the spatial metric is invariant under the parity @xmath161 , while the lapse changes sign under this parity , just as in the black hole solutions .",
    "thus , the observer - dependent rindler horizon is a parity horizon from the point of view of shape dynamics .",
    "this suggests that global disagreement with shape dynamics may arise whenever a stationary horizon of _ any _ kind is present in a solution general relativity , and that the corresponding solution of shape dynamics will contain a parity horizon .    in the following section",
    ", i will present yet another solution of shape dynamics that possesses a parity horizon and which presents physical differences from the corresponding solution of general relativity in that the general relativistic solution contains closed time - like curves while the shape dynamics solution does not .",
    "this can be seen as an advantage for shape dynamics , as closed timelike curves violate causality and solutions of general relativity containing closed time - like curves are generally explained away on a case by case basis as being  unphysical \" for various reasons ( e.g. they are quantum - mechanically unstable or they require non - localized matter distributions ) . in shape dynamics ,",
    "no such ad - hoc apologies are necessary solutions of shape dynamics simply seem not to contain these pathologies .",
    "the van stockum - bonner space - times are a class of asymtotically flat stationary , axisymmetric solutions of einstein s equations sourced by rigidly rotating dust .",
    "the solutions are ( with the exception of the lowest order case , which is invariant under translations parallel to the @xmath162-axis , and is _ not _ asymptotically flat ) ultra - relativistic in the sense that they possess no newtonian limit .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out in @xcite that any density gradient in the @xmath162-direction would produce gravitational forces parallel to the @xmath162-axis that would violate the assumption of rigid rotation . in general relativity , solutions with rigidly rotating dust are possible provided the angular velocity of the dust is sufficiently rapid .",
    "let us briefly review the properties of the van stockum - bonner space - times .",
    "our discussion closely follows that of @xcite which the interested reader may consult for further details . in cylindrical coordinates , the bonner - van stockum space - times",
    "are described by the line element    @xmath163    the einstein field equations imply that    @xmath164    differentiating and with respect to @xmath162 and @xmath165 respectively , and noting that the partial derivatives commute then requires that @xmath166 satisfy the linear , elliptic partial differential equation :    @xmath167    given a solution of , one can solve the system , for @xmath168 which completely determines the line element . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the general line element ( up to coordinate transformations ) representing a stationary , axisymmetric solution of the einstein field equations    @xmath169 + 2\\omega\\phi\\xi d \\phi dt\\ ] ]    induces a maximal slicing by hypersurfaces of constant @xmath120 .",
    "putting @xmath170 , @xmath171 , can be put in the form of by making an appropriate choice of the structure functions @xmath2 , @xmath80 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 :",
    "@xmath174    this implies that induces a maximal slicing by hypersurfaces of constant @xmath120 , which is precisely the criterion needed to map a solution of general relativity onto a solution of shape dynamics , at least locally .",
    "every solution of yields a solution of that possesses a surface defined by the equation @xmath175 , and it can be readily seen that such a surface has two important properties .    first , on such a surface @xmath176 , and it can be easily checked for any solution that this divides the space - time into two regions : an  exterior \" region defined by @xmath177 and an  interior region \" defined by @xmath178 . in the interior region , @xmath179 , and",
    "the coordinate basis vector @xmath180 is therefore _ time - like _ in this region .",
    "since the coordinate @xmath17 is periodic with period @xmath181 , the integral curves of @xmath180 are closed .",
    "therefore , the interior region is filled with closed time - like curves .",
    "any surface which divides a space - time into a causal region without closed time - like curves , and an acausal region with closed time - like curves is a special kind of cauchy horizon called a chronological horizon . for more details on closed time - like curves and chronological horizons ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the second important feature of this chronological horizon , is that the lapse function , @xmath2 goes to infinity there , as can be easily from the first of equations .",
    "recall that the determinant of the space - time metric can be written @xmath0 , and if this quantity is finite as it must be for a non - singular region of space - time , then if the lapse function @xmath2 diverges on some surface , the determinant of the spatial metric must vanish .",
    "this is indeed the case , since @xmath182 and there are no off - diagonal terms in the spatial metric .",
    "this is a signal that the  spatial \" metric changes signature across this surface and is no longer truly spatial in the interior region .",
    "this is physically unacceptable from the point of view of shape dynamics , since shape dynamics is a theory of the time evolution of conformal equivalence classes of _ riemannian _ three - manifolds .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the line element induces a maximal slicing by hypersurfaces of constant @xmath120 in the exterior region , means that this is a solution of shape dynamics in the exterior region . in what follows",
    ", i will consider a spatial coordinate transformation that is a diffeomorphism only in the exterior region , but which takes the line element into a form that makes the spatial metric non - degerate across the chronological horizon , yielding a complete solution of shape dynamics that covers the whole spatial manifold .",

    "nevertheless , the spatial metric is non - degenerate across the chronological horizon , and the coordinate @xmath217 can be extended to all real values .",
    "noting that the line - element is invariant under @xmath231 , it can easily be seen that the spatial geometry possesses a reflection symmetry about the chronological horizon . moreover , in the @xmath222 system , the lapse becomes    @xmath232    which changes sign under the parity @xmath231 . just as in the other solutions of shape dynamics with horizons that have been considered ,",
    "the  interior \" region may be interpreted as a time - reversed copy of the exterior region the chronological horizon becomes a parity horizon .",
    "this makes it obvious that no portion of the reconstructed space - time possesses closed time - like curves .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that since the spatial geometry is non - degenerate for all values of @xmath217 , and since the line element is globally related to by a spatial diffeomorphism ( except on the horizon , which needs to be treated with some care ) , this line element corresponds to a _",
    "complete _ solution of shape dynamics , covering the entire spatial manifold except the horizon , @xmath230 which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown that in the @xmath222 system the spatial metric becomes non - degenerate and the chronological horizon becomes a parity horizon .",
    "the canonical momentum in these coordinates can be found by considering hamilton s equation for @xmath233 :    @xmath234    where @xmath235 denotes the lie derivative of the spatial metric along the shift vector . with the gauge fixing conditions @xmath49 , @xmath236 , and noting that @xmath237 , yields the simple expression    @xmath238    for the canonical momentum @xmath239 .",
    "it is easily seen from that the trace of the momentum @xmath240 and this can be explicitly confirmed from and , so the weyl constraint is satisfied .",
    "one can also check that as @xmath241 , @xmath242 .",
    "this is not surprising as the transformation to the @xmath222 system deliberately introduced a singularity in the @xmath243 and @xmath244 components of the spatial metric in order to cancel the degeneracy from the vanishing the of @xmath245 component .",
    "next , it will be shown that the singularities appearing in spatial metric and its conjugate momentum are of a physical nature i.e. the chronological horizon of the bonner solution for shape dynamics is an extended physical singularity .",
    "finally , we argue that this result can generically be extended to a broader class of solutions containing chronological parity horizons .    since shape dynamics is a theory of evolving conformal geometries , our analysis will focus on invariants constructed from the conformally invariant degrees of freedom of the spatial curvature . in three spatial dimensions , the rank - three cotton tensor    @xmath246    contains all of the local information concerning the conformal geometry of space with the cotton tensor vanishing if and only if the spatial geometry is conformally flat .",
    "the algebraic complexity of the line element makes computation of the cotton tensor difficult , but one can analyze the behavior of the spatial conformal geometry of the exterior by considering the cotton tensor in spherical coordinates for @xmath247 . when this is done , one can compute the square of the cotton tensor :    @xmath248    where @xmath249 is a polynomial of degree 32 in @xmath86 and @xmath250 with integer coefficients and @xmath251 is a polynomial of degree 24 in @xmath86 and @xmath250 with integer coefficients .",
    "it can be shown using numerical methods that @xmath249 is non - zero on the horizon , while @xmath251 goes to zero there .",

    "one can see from figures 2 and 3 that @xmath252 goes smoothly to zero along a curve in the @xmath259 plane , and it can be shown that this curve exactly coincides with the chronological horizon @xmath260 for values of @xmath86 and @xmath202 that lie in the interior of the horizon , the plots have no physical significance , as the @xmath261 system yields an ill - defined spatial conformally geometry for these values .",
    "nevertheless , we can gain insight from the behavior of the invariant @xmath262 outside and on the horizon . since this invariant diverges smoothly as one approaches the horizon , and since it is an invariant of the spatial conformal geometry , there exists no spatial diffeomorphism of the exterior that can remove this divergence .",
    "thus , we are forced to conclude that the cost of removing the degeneracy of the spatial metric in order to find a complete solution of shape dynamics is that the parity horizon of the shape dynamics solution must be regarded as an extended physical singularity .",
    "in fact , there is good reason to think that the feature we have just observed , namely that the chronological horizon becomes an extended physical singularity in shape dynamics , holds quite a bit more generally than in the specific case we have considered above .",

    "the various known and novel stationary , axisymmetric solutions of asymptotically flat shape dynamics presented in this work demonstrate the pervasiveness of parity horizons in this context . the fact that black hole solutions of shape dynamics are physically different from those of general relativity opens up new possibilities for black hole physics and thermodynamics if shape dynamics is the correct description of true degrees of freedom of the classical gravitational field .",
    "some very preliminary results on the thermodynamics of shape dynamic black holes was discussed in @xcite .",
    "a particularly striking feature of these solutions is that they contain no central physical singularity , a fact that strongly suggests that shape dynamic black holes do not suffer from an information loss paradox as general relativistic black holes do .",
    "the cpt invariance of electrovac black hole solutions with a high degree of symmetry presents an interesting possible connection to the standard model of particle physics . while shape dynamic black holes have some promising features , there are still some important open questions that need to be addressed , not least of which is whether such solutions can form from collapse , a problem which is already being explored and which promises to shed light on the known eternal solutions .",
    "collapse models are also an important step in unerstanding two features of shape dynamic black holes which are currently poorly understood : first , what does an observer see as she passes through the horizon of a shape dynamic black hole ? and second , do shape dynamic black holes evaporate via hawking radiation ?",
    "the first of these questions arises as a result of the fact that these solutions do not form well - defined space - time geometries on the horizon . as a result ,",
    "the time - like component of the geodesic equation is ill - defined at the horizon , and the trajectories of observers that would ordinarily be expressed as time - like geodesics con no longer be described in this manner .",
    "this might be resolved by defining time - like geodesics connecting points in the interior and exterior at different times as piece - wise smooth curves that are timelike geodesics in the interior and exterior regions and that minimize the proper time . in this way",
    "the resulting degenerate spacetime becomes geodesically complete , although the geodesics defined in this manner have a discontinuity in their tangent vector at the horizon .",
    "while this seems like a reasonable definition , it remains troubling that the trajectories of observers can not be determined locally as the solution of a second or differential equation that is well - defined everywhere .",
    "the second question was partially addressed in @xcite where it was noted that since shape dynamic black holes agree with general relativistic black holes in the exterior region it may be possible to import whole - cloth certain derivations of hawking radiation that make no reference to the interior region .",
    "this can be done by solving the klein - gordon equation in the background of the exterior black hole geometry , quantizing the klein - gordon field , and relating the ingoing modes at past null infinity to ingoing modes at the horizon and outgoing modes at future null infinity via bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "still , it would be preferable to derive hawking radiation in the context of a collapse model in order to obtain a more concrete physical picture of the dynamics of black hole formation and evaporation .",
    "rindler space provides a simple example of a solution of shape dynamics that might be used to study black hole thermodynamics via the unruh effect .",
    "moreover , all of the black hole solutions of shape dynamics share the same global causal structure as rindler space , so this simple example might be used as a toy model to study more complicated questions about shape dynamic black holes .",
    "the singular parity horizon encountered in the case of the bonner solution clarifies the role of the assumption of global hyperbolicity in shape dynamics , and suggests a general chronology protection mechanism in shape dynamics .",
    "one can assume global hyperbolicity from the outset and then solutions with closed time - like curves are automatically excluded , but there remain solutions of general relativity which admit maximal slicing outside of the chronological cauchy horizon .",
    "the procedure outlined in the case of the bonner spacetime explains how these two facts can be reconciled . by making a singular coordinate transformation that makes the spatial metric invertible across the cauchy horizon , one obtains a global solution of shape dynamics in which closed time - like curves do not form , and which contains closed null curves only on a singular sub - surface of measure zero .",
    "if one demands continuity of the phase space variables then these solutions must be discarded , since the metric and momentum are divergent there and the singularity of square of the cotton tensor ensures that there is no spatial diffeomophism which can remove these divergences .",
    "clearly , much work remains in understanding the physical differences between shape dynamics and general relativity , but the solutions presented in this work suggest that parity horizons , or some dynamical generalization thereof my be of great utility in characterizing the possible global differences between the two theories that can arise .",
