    "the spectrum of one - particle excitations of a system of correlated electrons in a solid is a fundamental question in condensed - matter physics .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the excitation spectrum poses a long - standing and not yet generally solved problem . within the independent - electron approximation the spectrum is simply given in terms of the one - particle eigenenergies of the hamiltonian .",
    "analogously , it is widely accepted to interpret a measured photo emission spectrum by referring to the results of band - structure calculations that are based on density functional theory ( dft ) and the local density approximation ( lsda ) @xcite .",
    "such an interpretation is questionable since there is actually no direct correspondence between the kohn - sham eigenenergies and the one - particle excitations of the system @xcite . for an in principle correct description of the excitation energies",
    ", the local lsda exchange - correlation potential has to be supplemented by the non - local , complex and energy - dependent self - energy which leads to the dyson equation @xcite instead of the schrdinger- or dirac - type equation in the non- or fully relativistic kohn - sham scheme .    to overcome these deficiencies",
    "we have developed a generalized approach by accounting properly for electronic correlations beyond the lsda .",
    "for this purpose a general non - local , site - diagonal , complex and energy - dependent self - energy @xmath0 @xcite , has been included self - consistently in the fully relativistic korringa - kohn - rostoker multiple scattering theory ( sprkkr ) @xcite . within this scheme",
    "the self - energy is determined by a self - consistent dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculation .",
    "this method is straightforwardly applicable for electronic structure calculations of 3d- and 2d - systems with perfect lateral translational invariance and arbitrary number of atoms per unit cell .",
    "furthermore , the calculational scheme has been extended to the case of disordered alloys @xcite , to include many - body correlation effects in the electronic structure and photo emission calculations of these class of complex compound materials .",
    "provided that the self - energy is known , one can deduce a pes / ipe `` raw spectrum '' from the solution of the dyson equation . to achieve a reliable interpretation of experiments , however , it is inevitable to deal with so - called matrix - element effects which considerably modify and distort the raw spectrum .",
    "above all , the wave - vector and energy dependence of the transition - matrix elements has to be accounted for .",
    "these dependencies are known to be important and actually can not be neglected .",
    "they result from strong multiple - scattering processes which dominate the electron dynamics in the low - energy regime of typically 1 - 200  ev @xcite .",
    "the transition - matrix elements also include the effects of selection rules which are not accounted for in the raw spectrum .",
    "strictly speaking , it can be stated that the main task of a theory of photo emission is to close the gap between the raw spectrum obtained by lsda or lsda+dmft electronic - structure calculations and the experiment .",
    "the most successful theoretical approach is the so - called one - step model of photo emission as originally proposed by pendry and co - workers @xcite . in the following a short overwiew",
    "will be given on the recent extensions of the one - step model which are connected with correlation effects , disordered alloys , phonon related features and high excitation energies far beyond the ultraviolet regime .",
    "the main idea of the one - step model is to describe the actual excitation process , the transport of the photoelectron to the crystal surface as well as the escape into the vacuum @xcite as a single quantum - mechanically coherent process including all multiple - scattering events . within this model self - energy corrections , which give rise to damping in the quasi - particle spectrum ,",
    "are properly included in both the initial and the final states .",
    "this for example allows for transitions into evanescent band gap states decaying exponentially into the solid .",
    "similarly the assumption of a finite lifetime for the initial states gives the opportunity to calculate photo emission intensities from surface states and resonances .",
    "treating the initial and final states within the fully relativistic version of layer korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) theory @xcite , it is a straight forward task to describe complex layered structures like thin films and multilayers within the photo emission theory . furthermore , the surface described by a barrier potential can be easily included into the multiple - scattering formalism as an additional layer .",
    "a realistic surface barrier model which shows the correct asymptotic behavior has been introduced , for example , by rundgren and malmstrm @xcite .",
    "we start our considerations by a discussion of pendry s formula for the photocurrent which defines the one - step model of pes @xcite : @xmath1 the expression can be derived from fermi s golden rule for the transition probability per unit time @xcite , with @xmath2 denoting the elastic part of the photocurrent .",
    "vertex renormalizations are neglected .",
    "this excludes inelastic energy losses and corresponding quantum - mechanical interference terms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the rest system is not taken into account .",
    "this `` sudden approximation '' is expected to be justified for not too small photon energies .",
    "we consider an energy- , angle- and spin - resolved photo emission experiment .",
    "the state of the photoelectron at the detector is written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the component of the wave vector parallel to the surface , and @xmath5 is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron .",

    "for an appropriate description of the photo emission process we have to model the correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath9 beyond the crystal surface , introducing a single outgoing plane wave characterized by @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the damping of the final state due to the imaginary part of the inner potential @xmath11 must be taken into account .",
    "we thus construct the final state within spin - polarized low - energy electron diffraction ( spleed ) theory considering a single plane wave @xmath12 advancing onto the crystal surface . using the standard layer - kkr method @xcite generalized for the relativistic case @xcite",

    "however , in cases where for example several transitions appear close to the fermi level or even additional surface contributions to the photocurrent take place , this analysis might be questionable .",
    "therefore , it seems to be quite reasonable to make a direct comparison between angle resolved photo emission calculations and corresponding experimental data . for this purpose",
    "we developed a scheme that allows to include directly a @xmath112-dependent self - energy into the one - step model of photo emission . in fig .",
    "7 we present photo emission spectra calculated for the two cases without ( left pannel ) and with ( middle panel ) electron - phonon interactions and compare them to the correponding measurements @xcite .",
    "the contour plot has been calculated for hei light along @xmath113 .",
    "more precisely , bands forming the locally tubular fermi surface of pb(110 ) crosses e@xmath114 at about @xmath115 off - normal emission along @xmath113 . in the middle pannel of fig .  7 a clear renormalisation of the bare band ( often called _ kink _ ) at @xmath116mev binding",
    "energy is observable .",
    "this effect appears just where the real part of the self - energy reaches its maximum .",
    "futhermore , an additional broadening of the spectral features due to the imaginary part of the phononic self - energy is visible in the calculated spectra .",
    "this , of course , completes a lifetime analyses of spectral features in a quantitative sense because the imaginary part of the phononic self - energy can be identified as the last contribution that has to be considered in addition to impurity scattering and electronic correlation related broadening mechanisms of photo emission intensities .",
    "we have shown several examples of photo emission calculations which reflect the wide range of applicability of the one - step model of photo emission . in its latest version that is directly combined with the sprkkr program package quantitative spectroscopical investigations may range from 10 ev up to 10 kev concerning the photon energy .",
    "this gives not only direct accsess to the uv regime but also to the so called haxpes - regime of angle resolved photo emission .",
    "due to the lsda+dmft method the range of applicability has been greatly enhanced ranging now from simple paramagnetic metals to complex layered compounds inhibiting strong electronic correlations .",
    "the recent extent of the one - step model to disorderd magnetic alloys round up the range of applicability to a variety of complex 3d- as well as 2d - materials and allows investigations on surface related features for low photon energies as well as bulk like analyses for higher photon energies . as it holds for photocurrent calculations in the haxpes regime phonon related effects",
    "are also very important when analysing the intensity distributions which are obtained for energies around the fermi level .",
    "the second point has been addressed in the last section in which we demonstrated how to introduce in a quatitative sense a k - dependent phononic self - energy that allows for spectroscopical calculations from kink - like structures .",
    "therefore this ansatz enlarges in combination with the lsda+dmft method again the range of applicability to systems like high t@xmath117 cuprats or other highly correlated classes of materials .",
    "financial support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through for 1346 , eb-154/18,eb-154/23 and mi-1327/1 is gratefully acknowledged .",
