    "the electronic density functional theory ( dft ) developed by hohenberg and kohn@xcite and kohn and sham @xcite in 1964 - 1965 has shown tremendous success in solid state physics , quantum chemistry and in computational material sciences @xcite .",
    "the central idea of dft is a transformation of the dependence of the properties of a system of interacting many - body system on their single - particle potential to a dependence on the ground state density , which provides a practical method to calculate ground state properties of electronic systems@xcite .",
    "david mermin generalized the dft formalism to calculate finite temperature properties @xcite and runge and gross extended dft further to calculate time - dependent properties and hence the excited state properties of electronic systems @xcite .",

    "it was also shown that dft provides new insights for quantum phase transitions@xcite .",
    "however , any realistic experiments has always been performed at finite temperatures , it is therefore desirable to connect the phase transitions and entanglement at finite temperatures .    in this work we show that density functional theory provides insights for finite temperature phase transitions .",
    "we prove that the equilibrium state of a quantum many - body system , which is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath , is a universal functional of the first derivative of the free energy with respect to the control parameters .",
    "this finding explains how the non - analytic behavior of free energy at critical point affects the expectation values of physical observable at phase transition point .",
    "since entanglement in quantum many - body systems is a functional of expectation value of observable , the finding also introduces a direct link between entanglement and the first derivatives of free energy , leading to a deep connection between entanglement and phase transitions .",

    "the first constraint is that the average energy of the system is fixed , @xmath3&=&\\langle e\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is because the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath and there is no macroscopic energy flow between them .",

    "<S> this insight from density functional theory enables us to express the average value of any physical observable and any entanglement measure as a universal functional of the first derivatives of the free energy with respect to temperature and other control parameters . </S>",
    "<S> since phase transitions are marked by the nonanalytic behavior of free energy with respect to control parameters , the physical quantities and entanglement measures may present nonanalytic behavior at critical point inherited from their dependence on the first derivative of free energy . </S>",
