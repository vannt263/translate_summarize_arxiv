    "quiescent prominences , or filaments , are dynamic formations of relatively cool and dense plasma ( t @xmath3  k , @xmath4 ) extending into the much hotter and rarefied corona ( t @xmath5  k , @xmath6 ) over magnetic polarity boundaries far from active regions @xcite . in the `` polar crown '' regions",
    "they are frequently observed in so - called `` coronal cavities , '' dark elliptical structures seen during eclipses or in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray images of the corona @xcite .",
    "coronal cavities and prominences are the progenitors of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , with the overlying arcade loop system , the cavity , and the prominence comprising the leading dense shell , dark void , and bright trailing material , respectively @xcite .",
    "understanding the mechanisms of formation , evolution , and eventual eruption of this complex magnetic system is a central goal of solar physics .",
    "prominence formation mechanisms can be generally classified into chromospheric transport and coronal condensation @xcite . in the former , _ cool _ plasma is lifted from the chromosphere into the corona by siphon flows @xcite , magnetic reconnection @xcite , or magnetic flux emergence @xcite . in the latter , _ hot",
    "_ plasma in the local corona condenses into a prominence @xcite . confirming observations of any of these mechanisms have thus far been elusive .    here",
    "we report the first analysis of _ solar dynamics observatory _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( sdo / aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations of apparent _ in situ _ formation of a quiescent prominence within a coronal cavity .",
    "the results are consistent with earlier studies of cloud prominence formation @xcite and support the hypothesis that coronal cavities and prominences are not in magnetostatic equilibrium , but instead harbor a novel magneto - thermal convection @xcite with hot upflows and condensation downflows enabling the build - up of magnetic energy and helicity and culminating in an eruptive cme @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical analyses @xcite suggest that mhd condensation has a resistive origin due to runaway thermal collapse of condensing plasmas and spontaneous current sheets @xcite , leading to rapid condensation and cross - field transport of prominence plasma .",
    "the event under study occurred on 2728 april 2012 on the nw limb ( heliographic x , y : + 375 , + 900  from disk center ) . beginning at 04/27 00:00 ut , a tall quiescent polar crown prominence was observed in the aia 304    channel , extending approximately 150   ( 108 mm ) above the limb .",
    "the prominence was surrounded by a large well - defined coronal cavity that shows maximum contrast in the 211    channel .",
    "the prominence gradually disappears from the 304    channel over the course of the next 13 hours , due primarily to downward mass flows , as well as perhaps thermal `` disparation brusque '' ( dbt ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the time scale for the disappearance is much shorter than required for solar rotation to displace the prominence longitudinally from the limb .",
    "also , stereo / euvi data establish that the cavity has a very large longitudinal extent , with prominence plasma remaining at other longitudes .",
    "however those same data show that the prominence we observe at the aia limb is distinct from these other formations . figures  [ fig:171 + 304](a)(c ) show this temporal evolution in the aia 304 and 171    channels .    following the disappearance",
    ", the cavity region near the limb remains prominence - free for some 56 hours .",
    "meanwhile , a `` cloud '' of hot plasma gradually accumulates near the core of the cavity .",
    "the cloud has the highest contrast against the background in the 171    channel and develops into its brightest apparition by 04/28 01:28  ut . at about 04/27 22:00",
    "ut there is an initial appearance of 304    emission at the lower edge of the cloud .",

    "figures  [ fig:171 + 304](g)(i ) show that the 304    emission continues to expand in both height and width over the next several hours .",
    "simultaneously , the size of the 171    emission cloud decreases markedly . by 04/28 04:00  ut the 171    emission",
    "is confined largely to the region surrounding the growing prominence .",
    "thin threads of 171    emission can be seen curving outward and upward from the prominence at this time .",
    "such prominence `` horns '' have been observed in both prior aia data @xcite as well as soho data @xcite . in the final period of the observation , the 171    emission",
    "is confined to a very narrow `` prominence corona transition region '' ( pctr ) sheath @xcite with some residual projections upwards into the cavity . at this point ,",

    "figure  [ fig:193 + 171 ] shows a subset of the temporal sequence discussed above in the 193    and 171    channels .",
    "the subset begins at 04/27 10:55  ut when there was no prominence visible in the 304    channel , and shows a largely featureless , barely visible , coronal cavity in the 193    channel while the center of the cavity is well - defined in the 171    channel .",

    "these measurements are binned in temperature to create histograms of inferred temperatures , showing that there are two most likely solutions around @xmath11 and @xmath12  k. the peak around @xmath13  k shows a larger degree of clustering than the lower temperature peak implying that it is the more likely solution .",
    "in addition , this peak shows a trend toward a cooler temperature over the three time steps sampled in the dataset . in particular",

    "cavity contrast is calculated by examining the average emission in a timeslice of constant - height pixels ( dotted outline in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeslice](a ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass](a ) shows the timeslice and reveals that the core of the cavity darkens significantly beginning around 04/27 16:00  ut .",
    "this is several hours after the peak 211    emission of the cooling cloud , but roughly coincides with the rise to maximum emission in the 193    cloud , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeslice ] .",
    "as the cloud emission intensifies in the cooler channels , the cavity darkens further until by about 04/28 16:00  ut , the cavity achieves maximum darkness in the core .",
    "although cavity contrast is a strong function of view angle and hence can be influenced by solar rotation , at the heliographic latitude of the cavity ( n68 ) , the rotation is only @xmath15 over the 12  h during which the cavity contrast changes significantly , too little to explain the observed contrast change .",
    "we note also that the darkest region of cavity extends over a larger region than the prominence absorption .",
    "we estimate the prominence mass as the `` plane - of - sky '' ( pos ) mass , calculated by measuring the area of emission detected in the 304    channel and assuming that the prominence is a uniform thickness slab in the pos .",
    "this method grossly underestimates the true mass of the prominence since most prominences have significant longitudinal extent .",
    "nevertheless , the method allows an analysis of prominence mass over time at a zero - order level of detail ; changes in the assumed geometry of the prominence will alter only the absolute mass number and not the shape of the temporal curve .",
    "here we assume a typical prominence density of @xmath16 @xcite or @xmath17 , and a thickness of 10  ( 7300  km ) to arrive at the numbers shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass](b ) .",
    "the plot shows that the pos mass of the prominence steadily decreases at an average rate of approximately @xmath18  g  h@xmath19 from 00:00  ut to 12:00  ut on 27-april .",
    "beginning at about 22:00  ut , the new prominence forms initially at about the same rate .",
    "however the rate decreases after 04/28 3:00  ut and is highly variable thereafter .",
    "note that the onset of rapid coronal cavity darkening in the 211    channel corresponds well with the onset of prominence appearance in the 304    channel and that the cavity core increases in darkness as the prominence continues to accumulate mass ( see movie 1b ) . since coronal cavity core contrast is largely a function of plasma density relative to the surrounding corona @xcite",
    ", we interpret the darkening of the cavity core to indicate a loss of plasma from the region .",
    "we have analyzed observations of the dynamic formation of a quiescent polar crown prominence in a coronal cavity .",
    "the sequence of events is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "a pre - existing prominence slowly disappears due mostly to drainage and lateral transport of plasma ( fig .",
    "[ fig:171 + 304 ] ) .",
    "2 .   a bright emission cloud forms in the upper regions of the coronal cavity ( figs .",
    "[ fig:171 + 304 ] and [ fig:193 + 171 ] ) .",
    "the cloud descends toward the lower region of the cavity while sequentially becoming brighter in the 211 , 193 , and 171    channels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timeslice ] ) .",
    "a new prominence appears in the 304    channel and rapidly grows in both vertical and horizontal extent ( figs .",
    "[ fig:171 + 304 ] and [ fig : timeslice ] ) . 5 .",
    "the coronal cavity core above the prominence grows darker in the 211    channel as the 304    prominence grows ( fig .  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "6 .   when the prominence reaches its maximum size after approximately 18  h of growth , the emission cloud in the cavity is completely gone ( fig .",
    "[ fig:171 + 304 ] ) .",
    "taken together , these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the quiescent prominence has formed via condensation from hotter plasma contained in the core of the coronal cavity .",
    "we interpret the euv emission sequences in figs .",
    "[ fig:171 + 304 ] , [ fig:193 + 171 ] , and [ fig : timeslice ] as evidence of radiative cooling and descent of the hot plasma in the coronal cavity core , first appearing bright in the hotter 211    channel with a peak temperature of formation of @xmath20  k , followed by a shift to emission in the 193    channel ( @xmath21  k ) , followed by another shift to emission in the 171    channel ( @xmath22  k ) , and finally appearing in the `` chromospheric '' 304    channel ( @xmath0  k ) .",
    "the profile of the hotter filter ratio histogram widens toward cooler temperatures over time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : twofilter](g ) ) , further supporting our interpretation that the observed plasma radiatively cools to condense into the prominence .",
    "the drop in height of the cloud further supports this hypothesis .",
    "radiative cooling is proportional to @xmath23 at corona temperatures and increases with decreasing temperature in the @xmath24 57  k range .",
    "therefore a `` runaway thermal instability '' is possible in which the plasma cools increasingly rapidly as it becomes denser and cooler @xcite .",
    "the increased density of the cloud naturally results in higher gravitational force countering the local lorentz force of the cavity magnetic field .",
    "thus the descent of the cloud is consistent with radiative cooling and condensation in a weakly magnetized environment as the plasma seeks a new equilibrium height , possibly through resistive reconnection @xcite .",
    "as the prominence gains mass at the expense of the hot cloud , the coronal cavity simultaneously becomes more sharply defined in the 211    channel due to mass loss from the core region .",
    "the observations shown here imply the possibility of _ in situ _ formation of prominences in coronal cavities .",
    "given the large density disparity , @xcite estimated that the entire coronal mass could only support such condensation for a few large prominences .",
    "however this concern was based on the implicit assumption that prominences are magnetostatic suspensions of a fixed amount of plasma .",
    "but as shown by recent sdo / aia and _ hinode_/sot observations , quiescent prominences are in constant motion via drainage downflows @xcite and re - supply of mass through various mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated the mass loss in prominence downflows to be @xmath25  g / day or roughly the equivalent of a typical cme mass .",
    "thus the mass in a prominence changes significantly with time and is not directly related to the mass in the global corona in a simple manner .",
    "mass balance in prominences appears to be a cyclic process in which the mass transported into the coronal cavity determines how much can eventually condense to form prominences .",
    "similar cyclic processes have been proposed for the quiet sun coronal mass balance @xcite and coronal rain condensation @xcite .",
    "observations at the limb necessarily integrate along heliographic longitude .",
    "thus it is possible that the prominence that disappears is not at the same longitude as the new prominence that forms , or that the cloud and the new prominence are a line - of - sight coincidence .",
    "but the fact that the shrinkage of the cloud ( darkening of the cavity ) , the descent of the cloud , the formation of prominence `` horns '' , and the eventual formation of a pctr sheath are all synchronized with the growth of the prominence in the 304    channel argue against a line - of - sight coincidence .",
    "we note that the hot cloud itself exhibits no significant flows , other than its slow radial descent , during the condensation process .",
    "thus it is unlikely that we are confusing _ in situ _ condensation with flow - based formation mechanisms such as flows between disparate magnetic footpoints ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
