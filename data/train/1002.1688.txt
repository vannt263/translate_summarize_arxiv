    "the investigation of low - dimensional solid state devices has allowed the direct observation of quantum behavior in electron systems .",
    "these effects arise due to the confinement of carriers in structures that constrain their movement along one or more directions , such as quantum wells , quantum wires and quantum dots . one important class of such low - dimensional systems are quantum rings , in which a particular type of confinement together with phase coherence of the electron wavefunction allows the observation of effects such as the aharonov - bohm @xcite and aharonov - casher @xcite effects .",
    "quantum rings have been extensively studied in semiconductor systems , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite and are expected to find application in microelectronics , as well as in future quantum information devices .    in this paper",
    "we present analytical results for the eigenstates and energy levels of ideal quantum rings created with graphene and bilayer graphene .",
    "graphene is an atomic layer of crystal carbon which has been the target of intense scrutiny since it has been experimentally produced @xcite .",
    "part of this interest stems from the unusual properties of carriers in graphene , caused by the gapless and approximately linear carrier spectrum , together with possible technological applications , such as transistors , gas sensors and transparent conducting materials in e.g. photovoltaics .",
    "additionally , it has been found that two coupled graphene sheets , also known as bilayer graphene displays properties that are distinct from single layer graphene as well as from graphite .",
    "the carrier spectrum of bilayer graphene is gapless and approximately parabolic at the vicinity of two points in the brillouin zone @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the spectrum is strongly influenced by an external electric field perpendicular to the bilayer , leading to the appearance of a gap @xcite .",
    "the high quality of the single layer and bilayer graphene samples that have been obtained , together with the large mean free path of carriers suggests that phase coherence effects may be observable in these systems .",
    "recently , graphene - based quantum rings produced by lithographic techniques have been investigated on single - layer graphene @xcite .",
    "these systems have been studied theoretically by means of a tight - binding model , which does not provide straightforward analytical solutions for the eigenstates and eigenvalues @xcite . for bilayer graphene",
    "also it was recently shown @xcite that is possible to electrostatically confine quantum rings with a finite width .",
    "the energy spectrum was obtained by solving the dirac equation numerically .    in this paper",
    "we present a toy model that allows for analytical expressions for the energy levels of quantum rings in single layer and bilayer graphene .",
    "this model permits the description of several aspects of the physics of graphene quantum rings without the additional complications of edge effects and finite width of the quantum ring .",
    "we are able to obtain analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and the corresponding wavefunctions , the persistent current , and the orbital momentum as function of ring radius , total momentum and magnetic field , which can be related to the numerical results obtained by other methods .",
