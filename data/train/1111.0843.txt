    "the study of high - mass ( @xmath5 ) star formation still faces fundamental questions such as ( e.g. , @xcite ) what is the origin of the mass reservoir for the protostar ( whether the protostar can gather mass only from its own cocoon or competes with the nearby protostellar companions to accrete mass from the whole molecular clump ) and what is the accretion mechanism ( whether the mass is conveyed to the protostar through a stable accreting disk or via episodic accreting flows while the protostar crosses the denser portions of the molecular clump ) . to examine these questions , observations on linear scales matching",
    "the sizes of the molecular clumps ( 0.11  pc ) need to be combined with a closer view of the protostellar surroundings ( the hot molecular cores , hmcs , with sizes of a few thousands of au ) to establish the presence of multiple sources , their kinematical structures , and a possible overall interaction .    focusing on a single protostellar core , very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) proper motion studies of maser spots in conjunction with sub - arcsecond imaging of the free - free emission of very young  regions and thermal jets",

    "the relative position of the 1.3  cm continuum with respect to the reference maser feature in table  [ distrib ] is obtained by matching the overall water maser distribution between the vlba and vla  a maps .",
    "we note that the ns spread of the maser emission overlaid on the radio continuum ( @xmath36 ) have remained almost stationary over about ten years ( cf .",

    "the peak position of the 0.7  cm continuum is assumed to be aligned with the 1.3  cm peak .",

    "while this matching is particularly striking , we note that more sensitive , q ",
    "band , observations are mandatory to confirm the spatial structure of the 0.7  cm emission . because of the stability of the water maser distribution , but also the similarities between the morphology of the water maser emission and the 0.7  cm continuum ( figure  [ puzzle]e ) , we estimate a relative position accuracy between the radio continuum and water masers of @xmath37 .",
    "previous observations spanning a broad - band spectrum between 6  cm to 1.3  mm show that the spectral index ( @xmath38 ) for wavelengths longer than 7  mm is dominated by free - free emission ( @xmath39 ) , whereas at shorter wavelengths the flux density is mostly due to dust emission ( @xmath40 ; @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss two basic characteristics observed in the ne water maser cluster ( figure  [ puzzle]b ) .",
    "firstly , we detected two arc - like filaments of water maser emission elongated in the ne ",
    "sw direction with no emission in between them .",
    "secondly , these arc - like filaments expand from each other with proper motions increasingly aligned with the ne  sw direction as one approaches this direction . bipolar distributions of water masers with expanding proper motions have been reported in a large number of star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these detections were interpreted as footprints of the interaction between collimated jets and/or wide - angle winds from ysos with the surrounding molecular envelope . following this evidence ,",
    "we want to show that the overall kinematics of the ne water maser cluster can be explained by assuming that a single object , in between the maser emission , emits a high - velocity , bipolar jet along the ne  sw direction ( figure  [ puzzle]b and [ pv]a ) . at first",
    ", we will compare the velocity profile of the water masers along the arc - like structures with the model of jet - driven outflows presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the jet model predicts that the interaction between a bow shock and the ambient material gives an upper and lower limit to the velocity of the processed material .",
    "this processed material is a mixture of material that was already part of the bow shock and material incorporated from the ambient medium as the shock front expands .",
    "the shock front delineates an arc - like structure ( as do the masers ) and the velocity component along the jet axis decreases roughly as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the offset distance from the head of the jet ( e.g. , figure  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the similarities of the spatial elongation and velocities of the water masers would be naturally explained if the ne  sw direction is associated with an outflow in this direction . in figure  [ pv]a , we define an elliptical symmetry that matches to first order both the width and the ne - sw elongation of the water maser distribution with a simple central symmetry ( major axis and eccentricity on top of figure  [ pv]a ) .",
    "this elliptical pattern allows us to define a new reference frame with origin at the center of the ellipse ( @xmath43  mas and @xmath44  mas w.r.t . the reference feature in table  [ distrib ] ) and",
    "_ x _ , _ y _ axes along the minor ( r ) and major ( z ) axes of the ellipse , respectively .",
    "this reference frame is tilted by @xmath45 to the east of the north direction . due to the small dispersion of lsr velocities ( 1.5  km s@xmath14 ) centered at about @xmath46  km s@xmath14",
    ", we also assume that all the maser features lie along the same plane .",
    "we want to study the velocity profile of the shock fronts traced by the water maser proper motions with respect to the new _ z  r _ reference frame . in the following ,",
    "we use the same terminology of @xcite and @xcite in order to facilitate the comparison with their jet model .    in figure  [ pv]b ,",
    "we report the behavior of the velocity components ( v@xmath47 ) of the water masers along the major axis of the ellipse ( z ) .",
    "the idea that the z - direction is a preferred outflow direction is supported by the velocity profile in figure  [ pv]b , which resembles that expected for a ballistic bow - shock produced by a jet along the z - direction ( cf .",
    "figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "for such a bow - shock model velocities are constrained in figure  [ pv]b by two solid lines and the expected gas velocity should lie between them .",
    "these limits are derived from equations ( 22 ) , ( 18 ) , and ( 20 ) of @xcite and define the bow shock profile @xmath48 , the mean velocity of the mixing of jet and ambient material @xmath49 ( solid line ) in a shell , and the velocity of newly shocked ambient material @xmath50 ( dashed steeper line ) , respectively .",
    "these equations are parameterized by the jet radius @xmath51 , the velocity of the bow shock @xmath52 , and the ejection velocity @xmath53 of the material processed by the working surface , expressed as a multiple of the isothermal sound speed @xcite . for the radius of the high - velocity `` core '' of the jet ( @xmath51 )",
    ", we set the minimum projected distance to the r - axis measured with the masers of 1.8  mas ( @xmath54  au ) .",
    "this value implies a width - to - length ratio of the jet from the center of the ellipse of 0.05 , consistent with that found in the literature for h@xmath6 jets at typical scales of @xmath55  au ( e.g. , hh  212 in @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that @xmath51 is the only constraint we put on the model , whereas we consider the best value of the ratio @xmath56 and @xmath57 inferred from the simulations by @xcite . by setting the tip of the bow shock at the maximum maser projection along z ( the `` 0 '' in @xcite ) , we find a good agreement of the measured maser velocities ( black squares in figure  [ pv]b ) with the jet - driven outflow model . we note that the maser velocities are closer to the ambient material velocity ( dashed line ) in agreement with simulations by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  4 ) .",
    "this behavior may reflect an incomplete mixing of material already in the bow shock shell and material added from the ambient medium .",
    "the @xmath58 ratio implies a bow shock speed of about 66  km s@xmath14  for a sound speed of 8  km s@xmath14at the cooling cutoff of @xmath59  k ( see @xcite ) . on the contrary , in the alternative scenario of a wide - angle wind",
    "the v@xmath47 motions would increase linearly with z , that is not observed ( e.g. , @xcite their figure  9 ) .",
    "this suggests that the maser cloudlets are dragged along the z - direction by a jet - driven shock component .    on the other hand",
    ", the jet - driven outflow model predicts an upper limit to the transverse velocity component v@xmath60 with respect to the jet direction of the order of the sound speed ( @xmath61  km s@xmath14 ; see figure  3 in @xcite and figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "this limit is intimately related to the assumption that the transverse radial forces are dominated by thermal pressure gradients that act at the head of the jet . in figure",
    "[ pv]c , we measure the greatest deviations from the jet model far from the head of the jet , at an inclination of about @xmath4 from the jet axis . this behavior may suggest that , away from the head of the jet , thermal pressure gradients no longer dominate the expansion .",
    "one possibility would be that a low - velocity ( @xmath62  km s@xmath14 ) wind with a wide opening angle ( ca .",
    "@xmath4 ) acts with the jet simultaneously . in the wind - driven outflow model , the expansion of the outflow away from the central axis is driven by the ram pressure of a wide - angle wind @xcite : the v@xmath60 velocity is maximum far from the tip of the outflow shell and goes to zero at its tip ( figure  9 in @xcite ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of the two types of outflow mechanisms would agree with the hypothesis that any outflow contains a wide - angle wind at some level , in order to explain typical width - to - length ratio of about @xmath63 , much higher than in a `` pure jet model '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , if the single jet - driven model is correct , we can also get an estimate of the dynamical age of the jet - event exciting the water masers .",
    "the velocity of the jet ( @xmath64 ) is related to the bow shock speed ( @xmath52 ) by the ratio of the jet - to - ambient density , where @xmath52 approximates @xmath64 if the jet density exceeds the ambient density ( see @xcite ) . by considering the lower limit @xmath65 , the inferred value of @xmath66  km s@xmath14 , and the value of the higher maser projection along z",
    ", we obtain a dynamical age of @xmath67  yr .",
    "on the one hand , this dynamical age is consistent with other estimates based on the expanding motions of masers around forming ysos ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "given how unlikely it would be to observe such a short - lived event , it strongly suggests that we are tracing a recurrent phenomenon of ejection of matter from an yso .",
    "that would favor a pulsed - jet paradigm against a steady - jet one as supported , for instance , by the recurrent knots and bow shocks observed in the prototypical herbig - haro object 212 @xcite .",
    "this interpretation naturally explains also the eastern water masers in figure  [ pv]a ( features # 38 , 39 in table  [ distrib ] ) and the masers at about 150  mas to the south of the ne cluster ( the me cluster in table  [ distrib ] ) .",
    "these masers would belong to an older jet emission from the same object .",
    "in this section , we discuss three characteristics observed in the se water maser cluster : the projected v  shape of the water maser distribution on the plane of the sky , `` pointing '' toward the peak of the radio continuum emission ( figure  [ puzzle]d  e ) ; the water maser proper motions that mainly expand along the v  shape ( figure  [ puzzle]a ) ; the line - of - sight velocity gradient observed through the v ",
    "shape , with velocities increasing to the south ( figure  [ puzzle]f ) . in the following ,",
    "we relate these properties with the large - scale outflow and the nature of the radio continuum emission and suggest that the h@xmath6o masers trace the edges of the outflow cavity associated with a massive yso ( see figure  [ outflow]a ) .",
    "the h@xmath6o emission from the se cluster is blueshifted with respect to the overall velocity of the cloud ( @xmath68 ) and covers a range of line - of - sight velocities consistent with the small - scale , blueshifted wing of the co(32 ) outflow ( between -10 and -40  km s@xmath14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the v  shape observed in the water maser emission opens toward the west , where a limb - brightened cavity was previously outlined as nir loops @xcite .",
    "these loops were explained as wind - bubbles , which were created as the blueshifted ( western ) side of the outflow pushed against the environment and swept up ambient material @xcite .",
    "we note that the wide opening angle of the nir loops ( @xmath69 ) is consistent with that of the v  shape ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "actually , if the loops outlined the outflow cavity , one might expect the water masers along the outflow walls , where shocks are more likely .",
    "the h@xmath6o v  shape opens toward a position angle ( p.a.=256 ) in good agreement with the direction of the western side of the outflow , which has been detected in a number of tracers : the nir bright loops , with a @xmath71 , surrounding the outflow cavity with a symmetry axis at a p.a .",
    "of 259  ( e.g. , @xcite , see their figure  3 ) ; the blueshifted co lobe with a p.a .",
    "of about 260  ( e.g. , @xcite , see their figure  4 ) ; the western , aligned , herbig - haro objects with a @xmath72 @xcite and the hot h@xmath6 knots in the same direction @xcite ; the elongated 1.3  cm continuum with a p.a . of 268  and a spectral index consistent with an ionized wind ( figure  [ puzzle]d ) .",
    "if water masers would belong to the blueshifted outflow lobe , and might possibly amplify the continuum background at 1.3  cm , it would naturally explain the non - detection of redshifted maser emission , that would belong to the receding outflow lobe .",
    "also , since the outflow axis is close to the line - of - sight ( within @xmath73 ; @xcite ) , this scenario agrees with the direction of the maser proper motions , that are mainly expanding parallel to the v  shape with a strong component toward the observer ( figure  [ outflow ] ) .",
    "the velocity gradient observed across the maser v ",
    "shape ( figure  [ puzzle]f ) might be reproduced with a slow precession of the outflow axis about the mean direction @xmath74 in figure  [ outflow ] ( as speculated at first by @xcite ) .",
    "the strong water masers and the radio continuum emission from vla3 ( figure  [ puzzle]d  e ) suggest an association with a massive yso @xcite . if the free - free emission longward of 7  mm wavelength originates from an ionized wind , we can estimate a lower limit to the mass - loss rate ( @xmath75 ) of the wind and put a constraint to the the nature of the driving source .",
    "we apply equation ( 4 ) of @xcite and use the flux at 1.3  cm to estimate the mass - loss rate in the assumption of a spherical , isothermal , completely photoionized , uniform wind :    @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the velocity of the wind .",
    "we have considered the accurate value of the recently measured distance to afgl  2591 and a wind velocity of several @xmath78  km s@xmath14 , reported in both the @xmath79 $ ] lines by @xcite and the ir @xmath80co broad wings by @xcite .",
    "the assumption of a spherical wind is justified by the wide opening angle observed both with the maser emission and the nir loops ( @xmath69 ) . note that , @xcite used the lower flux at 3.6  cm to estimate the mass - loss rate , based on their model with a dusty disk that would have affected the flux at 1.3  cm .",
    "still , at the new measured distance of 3.3  kpc , their modeled flux would decrease by a factor 10 and no longer be applicable , while the spectral index for wavelengths longer than 0.7  cm suggests an origin in a ionized wind @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate from equation  ( [ massloss ] ) implies a photoionizing zams star of type o9 , with a rate of ionizing photons ( n@xmath81 ) of about @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we compare this value with the estimates of mass and lyman continuum flux derived by assuming a single star dominating the ir luminosity of the region .",
    "following @xcite , we used the theoretical hr diagram by @xcite to estimate the mass and effective temperature of a star with an ir luminosity of @xmath10 ; then , we used the stellar atmosphere models by @xcite to convert effective temperatures to lyman fluxes .",
    "these new values of m and n@xmath81 are about @xmath1 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "the estimates of lyman flux obtained independently from the radio continuum emission and the ir luminosity of the region agree within an order of magnitude . since the former one is a lower limit derived close to the source whereas the later one gives an upper limit to the number of lyman photons emitted over a larger field of view , this calculation provides evidence that a single massive object dominates the ir energetics of the region ( according to the high - resolution nir image of @xcite ) .",
    "we finally collect the information from the water masers and the radio continuum emission about the ongoing star formation in the region . taking into account a possible bias of detecting only a small number of ( bright ) sources",
    ", there is evidence of _ at least _ two clustering scales for star formation in the region .",
    "one on a linear scale of about 0.1  pc on the sky , from continuum sources vla1 , vla2 , and vla3 detected at first by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* named by @xcite ) .",
    "the other scale is an order of magnitude smaller and comes from our observation of at least three centers of expansion that pinpoint two other centers of star formation ( the ne and mw cluster ) , separated by about @xmath0 on the sky from the vla3 radio source .",
    "note that , the nw maser cluster might be either associated with the mw cluster or trace a further young object .",
    "our analysis in section  [ secluster ] shows that vla3 is the most massive ( @xmath84 ) and young object in the field dominating the ir luminosity .",
    "several lines of arguments from the spatial scale of the maser distribution also strengthen the association between vla3 and the large - scale dynamics of the molecular envelope , as traced by both jet `` footprints '' ( hh objects and h@xmath6 knots ) and the wide - angle outflow seen at the sub - parsec scale ( @xmath85 from vla3 ) .",
    "the other two objects indicated by water maser emission in figure  [ puzzle ] ( the ne and mw cluster ) were not detected at cm and mm wavelengths .",
    "we give an upper limit to their flux density at 1.3  cm of about 0.5  mjy ( @xmath86 ) . on the one hand , by assuming this radio continuum would come from a photoionized stellar wind , we can put an upper limit on the spectral type of the exciting ysos .",
    "following equation  ( 1 ) of @xcite which gives the rate of ionizing photons required to fully ionize a constant velocity wind , we get a value of @xmath87 that would imply a zams star with a spectral type later than b0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the high , isotropic , maser - luminosity of the ne and mw objects ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively ) would suggest they are not even low - mass ysos but possibly late b - type stars , by comparison with the se cluster luminosity ( @xmath90 ) and the h@xmath6o luminosity usually associated with low - mass stars ( @xmath91 ; e.g. , @xcite and their erratum ) ( their table  2 ) whereas vla1 does not show water maser emission . ] . in the formulation of @xcite ,",
    "the maser luminosity is a consequence of the dissipation in the ambient cloud of the mechanical energy of the outflow from a young star , and thus could be related to the mass of the driving source .",
    "we have presented multi - epoch , vlba , h@xmath6o maser observations toward the most compact radio source ( i.e. vla3 ) in the high - mass star - forming region afgl  2591 .",
    "we have also compared the maser distribution with the brightness structure of the radio continuum at 1.3 and 0.7  cm observed with the vla .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have detected three main clusters of water maser emission above a detection limit of 0.05  jy  beam@xmath14 ( @xmath25 ) within @xmath92 on the sky from the vla3 radio source ( the se water maser cluster ) .",
    "each water maser cluster shows internal expansion with velocities of a few tens of km s@xmath14  ( figure  [ puzzle]a ) . a global view of the star formation activity in afgl  2591  shows at least two spatial scales of star formation , one projected across 0.1  pc on the sky and another one at a ten times smaller scale as indicated by water maser emission .",
    "2 .   the kinematics of the ne water maser cluster shows characteristics of two symmetric , jet - driven , bow shocks expanding about 200  au from a still undetected protostar , with a velocity of about 66  km s@xmath14(figure  [ puzzle]b ) .",
    "our analysis of the water maser proper motions , compared to different outflow models , suggests that the primary wind may be a combination of a jet and a lower - velocity wind tilted about @xmath93 from the jet axis .",
    "the short dynamical age ( 14  yr ) of these expanding motions suggests they are probably related to recurrent ejection events from the central protostar(s ) .",
    "our analysis of the radio continuum emission compared with the ir luminosity of the region shows that vla3 is likely a zams star with a spectral type between o9o6 and a mass in the range @xmath94 .",
    "this young stellar object dominates the ir luminosity of the region .",
    "the water maser emission associated with vla3 expands toward the observer with velocities up to 50  km s@xmath14  and traces a v  shape along the plane of the sky ( figure  [ puzzle]d  f ) . the orientation of the maser v ",
    "shape is aligned with the high - velocity wings of the co outflow and the herbig - haro objects at a few tenth of pc from the star .",
    "the wide opening angle of the maser v ",
    "shape ( @xmath95 ) agrees with that of the outflow as inferred from nir emission along the edges of the outflow cavity .",
    "this water maser emission is likely amplified along the walls of the blueshifted outflow lobe from vla3 ( figure  [ outflow ] ) .",
