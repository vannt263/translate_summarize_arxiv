    "<S> two - nucleon momentum distributions are calculated for the ground states of @xmath0he and @xmath1he as a function of the nucleons relative and total momenta . </S>",
    "<S> we use variational monte carlo wave functions derived from a realistic hamiltonian with two- and three - nucleon potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum distribution of @xmath2 pairs is found to be much smaller than that of @xmath3 pairs for values of the relative momentum in the range ( 300500 ) mev / c and vanishing total momentum . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the total momentum increases to 400 mev / c , the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath3 pairs in this relative momentum range grows and approaches the limit 1/2 for @xmath0he and 1/4 for @xmath1he , corresponding to the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath3 pairs in these nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior should be easily observable in two - nucleon knock - out processes , such as @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> in a recent letter , we studied the role of tensor forces on the correlations between pairs of nucleons in light nuclei  @xcite . in that work we reported calculations of the relative momentum distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairs with vanishing total momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the strong spatial - spin - isospin correlations induced by the tensor force lead to large differences in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions at moderate values of the relative momentum in the pair . </S>",
    "<S> these differences have been observed in a two - nucleon knockout experiment on @xmath5c at jefferson laboratory ( jlab )  @xcite .    in this note , we report an extension of our calculations to finite total momentum of the correlated pair for @xmath0he and @xmath1he nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by a preliminary analysis of data on @xmath0he from the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) collaboration at jlab  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the large differences in @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions gradually diminish as the center - of - mass momentum increases , until it approaches the ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath3 pairs for a given whole nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability of finding two nucleons with relative momentum @xmath6 and total momentum @xmath7 in isospin state @xmath8 in the ground state of a nucleus is proportional to the density    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and similarly for @xmath12 and @xmath13 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is the isospin projection operator , and @xmath15 denotes the nuclear wave function in spin and spin - projection state @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of @xmath19 pairs in state @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , integrating @xmath20 over only @xmath7 gives the probability of finding two nucleons with relative momentum @xmath6 , regardless of their pair momentum @xmath7 ( and vice - versa ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for this study we use variational monte carlo ( vmc ) wave functions , derived from a realistic hamiltonian consisting of the argonne @xmath21 two - nucleon  @xcite and urbana - ix three - nucleon  @xcite interactions ( av18/uix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the double fourier transform in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rhoqq ] ) is computed by monte carlo ( mc ) integration . a standard metropolis walk , guided by @xmath22 , </S>",
    "<S> is used to sample configurations  @xcite . for each configuration a two - dimensional grid of gauss - legendre points , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> is used to compute the fourier transform . instead of just moving the @xmath25 position ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) away from a fixed @xmath28 position ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , </S>",
    "<S> both positions are moved symmetrically away from @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so eq .  ( [ eq : rhoqq ] ) becomes    @xmath31    here the polar angles of the @xmath32 and @xmath33 grids are also sampled by mc integration , with one sample per pair . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is similar to that adopted most recently in studies of the @xmath0he@xmath34 and @xmath1he@xmath35h reactions  @xcite , and has the advantage of very substantially reducing the statistical errors originating from the rapidly oscillating nature of the integrand for large values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> the present method is computationally intensive , because complete gaussian integrations have to be performed for each of the configurations sampled in the random walk . </S>",
    "<S> the large range of values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 required to obtain converged results , especially for @xmath0he , require fairly large numbers of points ; we used grids of up to 96 and 80 points for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also sum over all pairs in a given mc sample instead of just a single pair .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3 and @xmath2 distributions at five values of the total momentum @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , are shown as functions of the relative momentum @xmath36 for @xmath0he in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : plot3 ] and for @xmath1he in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : plot4 ] . the statistical errors due to the mc integration </S>",
    "<S> are displayed only for the @xmath2 pairs ; they are comparable for the @xmath3 pairs . when the total momentum vanishes , there is a node in the @xmath2 relative momentum distribution just below 2 @xmath39 , while the @xmath3 distribution has a broad shoulder in this region . </S>",
    "<S> integration over the relative momenta in the range 1.52.5 @xmath39 gives a ratio of @xmath2 to @xmath3 pairs @xmath40 for @xmath0he , compared to 1/2 for the whole nucleus integrated over all @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for @xmath1he and @xmath37=0 the value is @xmath41 , compared to 1/4 for the whole nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the much greater magnitude of the @xmath3 momentum distribution is due to the strong correlations induced by tensor components in the underlying @xmath19 potential . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath37=0 , the pair and residual @xmath42 system are in a relative @xmath43-wave . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in @xmath0he ( @xmath1he ) , whose spin - parity is @xmath44 ( 0@xmath45 ) , @xmath3 pairs are predominantly in @xmath46=0 and @xmath0s@xmath47-@xmath0d@xmath47 ( deuteron - like ) states , while @xmath2 pairs are in @xmath46=1 and @xmath48s@xmath49 ( quasi - bound ) states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath50-wave component of the deuteron - like pairs fills in the node in the @xmath43-wave momentum distribution .    however , for @xmath51 , the two clusters may have non - zero orbital angular momentum and hence the @xmath2 and @xmath3 pairs are no longer constrained to be in the quasi - bound or deuteron - like states . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath43-wave node in the @xmath2 pairs can be filled in by higher angular momentum states . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ fig : plot3 ] and [ fig : plot4 ] show that this does happen ; the node in the @xmath2 relative momentum distribution is rather rapidly filled in as @xmath37 increases . </S>",
    "<S> consequently @xmath52 increases as @xmath37 increases , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] for @xmath36 integrated over 1.52.5 @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most direct evidence for tensor correlations in nuclei comes from measurements of the deuteron structure functions and tensor polarization by elastic electron scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , these measurements have mapped out the fourier transforms of the charge densities of the deuteron in states with spin projections @xmath53 and @xmath54 , showing that they are very different . in other processes , such as @xmath55h@xmath56he  @xcite at very low energy , or proton knock - out from a polarized deuteron  @xcite the effects of tensor correlations are more subtle and their presence </S>",
    "<S> is not easily isolated in the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of corrections from initial or final state interactions and many - body terms in the transition operators .    </S>",
    "<S> some of these corrections will also affect , for instance , the cross sections for @xmath57 and @xmath58 knock - out processes in back - to - back kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> however , one would expect the contributions due to final state interactions in the @xmath3 and @xmath2 reactions , both between the nucleons in the pair and between these and the nucleons in the residual @xmath42 system , to be of similar magnitude for relative momenta in the range ( 300500 ) mev / c . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , charge - exchange processes have been estimated to give small ( @xmath59% ) corrections to these ratios in @xmath5c at jlab kinematics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such processes , which are induced by interactions between the knocked - out pair and the residual cluster , could change an initial @xmath60@xmath61 pair on its way out of the nucleus into the ( detected ) @xmath60@xmath60 pair , thus increasing the @xmath58 to @xmath57 cross section ratios . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , leading terms in the electromagnetic two - body current vanish in @xmath2 because of their isospin structure  @xcite . of course </S>",
    "<S> , they will contribute in @xmath3 , but are not expected to produce large effects .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent experiment at jlab referred to earlier has measured the ratio of @xmath5c@xmath57 to @xmath5c@xmath58 cross sections in back - to - back kinematics for relative momenta in the range 300500 mev / c  @xcite to be @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements have corroborated the results of an earlier analysis of a bnl experiment , which measured cross sections for @xmath63 and @xmath64 processes on @xmath5c in similar kinematics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed enhancement in the @xmath60@xmath61 to @xmath60@xmath60 ratio is in agreement with the prediction of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and beautifully demonstrates the crucial role that the tensor force plays in shaping the short - range structure of nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to extend these measurements to other nuclei . in @xmath0he and @xmath1he </S>",
    "<S> , one would expect the node in the @xmath60@xmath60 momentum distribution to be filled in by interaction effects in the final state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ratio of @xmath60@xmath60 to @xmath60@xmath61 cross sections in the range ( 300500 ) mev / c should still reflect the dominance of the @xmath60@xmath61 momentum distribution at these values of relative momenta . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the analysis of jlab clas data on @xmath0he mentioned above suggests that this is indeed the case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data also seem to confirm the rapid rise of the @xmath60@xmath60 to @xmath60@xmath61 ratio with increasing total pair momentum , predicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ratio ] of the present work . </S>"
