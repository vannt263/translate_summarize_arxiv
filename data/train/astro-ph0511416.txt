    "the last few years have seen the emergence of a standard @xmath1cdm model of cosmology motivated by and consistent with a wide range of observations , including the cosmic microwave background , distant supernovae , big - bang nucleosynthesis , large - scale structure , the abundance of rich galaxy clusters , and local measurements of the hubble constant ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    the power spectrum of fluctuations ( of temperature , density , flux , shear , etc . )",
    "is the primary statistic used to constrain cosmological parameters from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( @xcite ) , of galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , of the lyman alpha forest ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and of weak gravitational lensing ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    from a cosmological standpoint ,",
    "the most precious data lie at large , linear scales , where fluctuations preserve the imprint of their primordial generation .",
    "a generic , albeit not universal , prediction of inflation is that primordial fluctuations should be gaussian . at large , linear scales , observations are consistent with fluctuations being gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , much of the observational data , especially those involving galaxies , lies in the translinear or nonlinear regime .",
    "it remains a matter of ongoing research to elucidate the extent to which nonlinear data can be used to constrain cosmology .",
    "we recently began @xcite a program to measure quantitatively , from cosmological simulations , the fisher information content of the nonlinear matter power spectrum ( specifically , in the first instance , the information about the initial amplitude of the linear power spectrum ) .",
    "for gaussian fluctuations , the power spectrum contains all possible information about cosmological parameters . at nonlinear scales , where fluctuations are non - gaussian",
    ", it is natural to start by measuring information in the power spectrum , although it seems likely that additional information resides in the 3-point and higher order correlation functions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . measuring the fisher information in the power spectrum involves measuring the covariance matrix of power . for gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the expected covariance of estimates of power is known analytically , but at nonlinear scales the covariance of power must be estimated from simulations .    a common way to estimate the covariance matrix of a quantity is to measure its covariance over an ensemble of computer simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , a reliable estimate of covariance can be computationally expensive , requiring many , perhaps hundreds ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of realizations . on the other hand",
    "it is physically obvious that the fluctuations in the values of quantities over the different parts of a single simulation must somehow encode the covariance of the quantities .",
    "if the covariance could be measured from single simulations , then it would be possible to measure covariance from fewer , and from higher quality , simulations . in any case",
    ", the ability to measure covariance from a single simulation can be useful in identifying simulations whose statistical properties are atypical .",
    "a fundamental difficulty with estimating covariances from single simulations in cosmology is that the data are correlated over all scales , from small to large . as described by @xcite ,",
    "such correlations invalidate some of the `` jackknife '' and `` bootstrap '' schemes suggested in the literature . in jackknife , variance is inferred from how much a quantity varies when some segments of the data are kept , and some deleted .",
    "bootstrap is like jackknife , except that deleted segments are replaced with other segments .    as part of the work leading to the present paper , we investigated a form of the bootstrap procedure , in which we filled each octant of a simulation cube with a block of data selected randomly from the cube",
    "unfortunately , the sharp edges of the blocks introduced undesirable small scale power , which seemed to compromise the effort to measure covariance of power reliably . such effects can be mitigated by tapering @xcite .",
    "however , it seemed to us that bootstrapping , like jackknifing , is a form of re - weighting data , and that surely the best way to re - weight data would be to apply the most slowly possible varying weightings . for a periodic box , such weightings",
    "would be comprised of the largest scale modes , the fundamentals . in the present paper ,  [ estimate ]",
    ", we consider applying an arbitrary weighting to the density of a periodic cosmological simulation , and we show how the power spectrum ( and its covariance , and the covariance of its covariance ) of the weighted density are related to the true power spectrum ( and its covariance , and the covariance of its covariance ) . we confirm mathematically the intuitive idea that weighting with fundamentals yields the most reliable estimate of covariance of power . multiplying the density in real space by some weighting is equivalent to convolving the density in fourier space with the fourier transform of the weighting .",
    "this causes the power spectrum ( and its covariance , and the covariance of its covariance ) to be convolved with the fourier transform of the square ( and fourth , and eighth powers ) of the weighting .",
    "the convolution does least damage when the weighting window is as narrow as possible in fourier space , which means composed of fundamentals .    in  [ weightings ]",
    "we show how to design a best set of weightings , by minimizing the expected variance of the resulting estimate of covariance of power .",
    "these considerations lead us to recommend a specific set of @xmath0 weightings , each consisting of a combination of fundamental modes .",
    "this paper should have stopped neatly at this point .",
    "unfortunately , numerical simulations , described in a companion paper @xcite , revealed an unexpected ( one might say insidious ) , substantial discrepancy at nonlinear scales between the variance of power estimated by the weightings method and the variance of power estimated by the ensemble method . in ",
    "[ beatcoupling ] we argue that this discrepancy arises from beat - coupling , a nonlinear gravitational coupling to the large - scale beat mode between closely spaced nonlinear wavenumbers , when the power spectrum is measured from fourier modes at anything other than infinitely sharp sets of wavenumbers .",
    "surprisingly , in cosmologically realistic simulations , the covariance of power is dominated at nonlinear scales by this beat - coupling to large scales .",
    "we discuss the beat - coupling problem in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "beat - coupling is relevant to observations because real galaxy surveys yield fourier modes in finite bands of wavenumber @xmath2 , of width @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a chararacteristic linear size of the survey .",
    "section  [ summary ] summarizes the results .",
    "the fundamental idea of this paper is to apply an ensemble of weightings to a ( non - gaussian , in general ) density field , and to estimate the covariance of the power spectrum from the scatter in power between different weightings .",
    "this section derives the relation between the power spectrum of a weighted density field and the true power spectrum , along with its expected covariance , and the covariance of its covariance .",
    "it is shown , equations  ( [ piapprox ] ) , ( [ dphatidphatjf ] ) , and ( [ dphati2dphatj2 g ] ) , that the expected ( ( covariance of ) covariance of ) shell - averaged power of weighted density fields is simply proportional to the true ( ( covariance of ) covariance of ) shell - averaged power , provided that two approximations are made .",
    "the two approximations are , firstly , that the power spectrum and trispectrum are sufficiently slowly varying functions of their arguments , equations  ( [ papprox ] ) and ( [ tapprox ] ) , and , secondly , that power is estimated in sufficiently broad shells in @xmath2-space , equation  ( [ broadshellapprox ] ) .",
    "the required approximations are most accurate if the weightings contain only the largest scale fourier modes , such as the weightings containing only fundamental modes proposed in  [ weightings ] . as will be discussed in ",
    "[ beatcoupling ] , the apparently innocent assumption , equation  ( [ tapprox ] ) , that the trispectrum is a slowly varying function of its arguments , is incorrect , because it sets to zero some important beat - coupling contributions . however , it is convenient to pretend in this section and the next ,  [ estimate ] and  [ weightings ] , that the assumption  ( [ tapprox ] ) is true , and then to consider in  [ beatcoupling ] how the results are modified when the beat - coupling contributions to the trispectrum are included .",
    "ultimately we find ,  [ largescale ] , that the weightings method remains valid when beat - couplings are included , and ,  [ notquiteweightings ] , that the minimum variance weightings derived in  [ weightings ] , while no longer exactly minimum variance , should be close enough to remain good for practical application .",
    "this section is necessarily rather technical , because it is necessary to distinguish carefully between various flavours of power spectrum : estimated versus expected ; unweighted versus weighted ; non - shell - averaged versus shell - averaged .",
    "subsections  [ p ] to [ ddp ] present expressions for the various power spectra , their covariances , and the covariances of their covariances .",
    "subsections  [ subtractmeanp ] and [ subtractmeanddp ] show how the expressions are modified when , as is usually the case , deviations in power must be measured relative to an estimated rather than an expected value of power .",

    "the density @xmath5 might represent , perhaps , a realization of the nonlinearly evolved distribution of dark matter , or of galaxies",
    ". the density could be either continuous or discrete ( particles ) .",
    "expanded in fourier modes @xmath7 , the density @xmath5 is is used in both real and fourier space .",
