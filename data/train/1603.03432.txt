    "while due to the high pressure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) atomic gas is believed to be a relatively minor ingredient within the visible extent of the high - surface density galaxies observed at redshifts @xmath15 to 2 , a direct confirmation of this expectation has to await the square kilometer array ( and out to @xmath15 its pathfinders meerkat and askap ) .    in light of the potential systematics involved in estimating both the stellar and gaseous components ( and their spatial distribution ) , independent dynamical measurements provide a welcome reality check. conversely , given sufficient precision ( or trust ) in the baryonic measurements , kinematic constraints on the enclosed mass",

    "possible rotational components ( newman et al . 2015 ) and velocity dispersion anisotropies ( van der marel 1991 ) may in reality complicate the interpretation of quiescent galaxy kinematics , but are by lack of constraints rarely incorporated in high - redshift studies .",
    "an additional factor of consideration in the case of star - forming galaxies , is that their mass budget has a significant contribution by a gaseous component , negligible in quiescent systems .",
    "moreover , star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) are not spherical systems dominated by random motions , but generally show patterns of ordered disk rotation , albeit at high redshift with a significant dispersion and hence non - negligible pressure support component ( frster schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ; wisnioski et al . 2015 ) , making the translation between the observed line - of - sight velocity and the enclosed dynamical mass sensitive to inclination .",

    "as we will argue in this paper , the degeneracy between mass and inclination impacting observed radial velocities can in part be addressed by analyzing the kinematic properties of large samples of homogeneously selected distant galaxies .",

    ", we conservatively selected a sample of 240 galaxies with velocity gradients along a clearly identified kinematic major axis , and sufficient signal - to - noise and spatial extent in h@xmath18 to merit a detailed kinematic analysis including fitting of disk dynamical models .",

    "their characteristics will be the focus of future studies , as number statistics for these populations build up and deeper data is obtained . ] in roughly equal numbers , the reason for these conservative cuts were insufficient signal - to - noise , the absence of a clean rotational pattern with unambiguous kinematic axis , and offsets between kinematic and morphological position angles exceeding 40@xmath46 .",
    "the latter often coincide with orientations that are too face - on to be constraining in terms of disk dynamical modeling ( see also wisnioski et al . 2015 ) . the axial ratio distribution of excluded objects in the same region of sfr - size - mass parameter space as our core sample of 240 galaxies spans a large range from 0.2 to 1.0 .",
    "it is slightly skewed toward rounder shapes for the aforementioned reason .",
    "six objects were weeded out on the basis of a clear merger morphology for which no meaningful axial ratio ( and hence inclination ) could be measured ( following guidelines as outlined by kartaltepe et al .",
    "2015 ) , and in which case the framework of disk rotation probing the potential well depth may in any case not be appropriate .",
    "we note that a fraction of the galaxies in our sample may be undergoing minor mergers , which can be hard to distinguish from clumps formed in situ due to instabilities in gas - rich disks ( see , e.g. , mandelker et al .",
    "mock observations of hydrodynamical simulations illustrate how during certain stages and under certain viewing angles the orbital motions of such minor mergers may mimic signatures of disk rotation ( simons et al . in prep ) .",
    "depending on how aggressively or conservatively one selects , we estimate that 6 - 15% of our sample could tentatively be identified as a minor merger .",
    "we verified that this subpopulation does not occupy a unique corner of parameter space nor deviates from the general trends described in this paper , and excluding them would consequently not alter our conclusions .    to evaluate how representative our sample is for the overall population of massive star - forming galaxies ,",
    "we extract a mass - complete sample of sfgs ( @xmath44 & @xmath47 ) from the 3d - hst / candels data set ( skelton et al . 2014 ; momcheva et al . 2016 ) . in figure",

    "the kinematic sample features a flatter mass distribution than an exponentially declining schechter function .",
    "this is a deliberate choice in the survey design , where , particularly in the early runs , an emphasis was placed on the more massive galaxies .",
    "furthermore , galaxies with bright rest - uv luminosities are slightly overrepresented compared to the underlying population .",
    "this reflects the high demand on data quality and h@xmath18 signal - to - noise ratio ( the latter not being available for full underlying 3d - hst sample , but correlating with @xmath48 ) .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms that , in each redshift bin , the probability that the kinematic sample and the mass - complete 3d - hst sample share the same parent stellar mass and @xmath48 distribution is less than 2% .",
    "a minor deficit of low ssfr , and very small systems is only statistically significant in the highest redshift bin . in section  [ redshift.sec ] , after showing the results for the kinematic sample , we apply weights to galaxies in the kmos@xmath32 sample in order to address to which degree median mass fractions and their redshift evolution may differ for a mass - complete population of sfgs .",
    "any changes found are at the level of 0.1 dex or smaller .",

    "we first outline the kinematic extraction ( section  [ velprof.sec ] ) , then describe in more detail how we computed the dynamical masses ( section  [ dysmal.sec ] ) , and briefly summarize the methodology used to infer the stellar and gas masses that enter the assessment of the baryonic mass fractions ) . ]",

    "the uncertainties are boot - strapped using monte carlo techniques .",
    "examples of extracted rotation and dispersion profiles are presented in figure  [ gallery.fig ] .",
    "while employing a pseudo - slit extraction , we emphasize that the analysis presented in this paper benefits critically from the integral - field nature of our data set , enabling a more reliable kinematic classification as well as a more reliable determination of the kinematic center and major axis position angle , which is critical in deriving dynamical masses ( e.g. , swaters et al . 2003",
    "; frster schreiber et al . 2009 ; wisnioski et al . 2015 ) . for the purpose of our analysis , and given the combination of angular resolution and size of our galaxies , the major axis information provides the strongest constraints on the simple disk models we use .",
    "in contrast , the off - axis information is relatively insensitive to constrain the velocity gradient , and depends mainly on inclination ( see , e.g. , figure 1 of van der kruit & allen 1978 and figure 9 of glazebrook 2013 ) .",

    "we furthermore account for the fact that the shape of the velocity and velocity dispersion profiles are coupled in two ways : through beam smearing and pressure support ( see burkert et al .",
    "2016 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the first is a purely observational effect of finite resolution in which the observed velocity gradient is reduced with respect to the intrinsic one , with beam - smeared velocities giving rise to a central peak in dispersion superposed on a dispersion floor @xmath49 . as illustrated by burkert et al .",

    "2009 ; kassin et al . 2012",
    "; wisnioski et al . 2015 ) .",
    "this implies that their dynamical support has a non - negligible pressure component , which has the effect of reducing the rotational velocity @xmath73 compared to the circular velocity @xmath74 of a thin disk in the absence of pressure support , particularly at large radii :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the disk scale length ( burkert et al .",

    "taking into account the @xmath71 and @xmath72 constraints simultaneously in a self - consistent manner enhances the robustness of the best - fit dynamical mass within @xmath8 , also in cases where a turnover in velocity is not or only marginally detected ( see also appendix a ) .",
    "given that we keep the shape of the mass distribution fixed , higher @xmath17 than those resulting from the fit would lead to velocity gradients that are too steep and , to the degree this is washed out by beam smearing , a central peak in velocity dispersion that is higher than observed .",

    "circular apertures overplotted on the velocity fields mark the extraction regions for the 1d profiles .",

    "is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 ( rix et al .",

    "this could reduce the h@xmath18 signal - to - noise ratio , and potentially cause them to drop out of our sample more easily . on the other hand , as reported in section  [ sample.sec ] , some galaxies , while h@xmath18 detected , did not pass our sample selection because their face - on view prevented meaningful constraints on the enclosed dynamical mass .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ inclination.fig ] illustrates that nevertheless the inclination distribution of our sample as inferred from axial ratio measurements on the hst imaging is relatively flat , mimicking that of the underlying matched 3d - hst population ( normalized distribution shown in green ) .",

    "we investigate this in figure  [ zevol_parent.fig ] using the following crude approach .",
    "to each galaxy from the mass - complete 3d - hst sample described in section  [ sample.sec ] we assign a value of @xmath93 and @xmath95 based on the kmos@xmath32 galaxy that resembles it most closely in intrinsic properties ( position in sfr - mass space and surface density ) . or in other words , we effectively assign weights to each kmos@xmath32 galaxy in order for the sample to better mimic the underlying population .",

    "it is worth noting that by selecting galaxies above a fixed mass limit , one does not trace progenitor - descendant populations across cosmic time .",
    "galaxies grow in mass , and new galaxies will hence cross the mass limit and enter the sample as time proceeds . selecting galaxies above a mass limit that evolves with redshift , corresponding to a fixed cumulative comoving number density is a commonly adopted alternative ( e.g. , van dokkum et al . 2010 , 2013 , 2015 ; papovich et al . 2011 ; patel et al .",

    "we infer stellar mass fractions to be relatively constant over the time interval studied , leaving substantial room for other mass components , and baryonic mass fractions that were higher at earlier epochs .",
    "the statistics on inferred mass fractions above a fixed or evolving mass limit are also listed in table  [ massfrac.tab ] .    aside from redshift , we explored correlations of the stellar and baryonic mass fractions with various other parameters , including different mass components , gas fractions , specific star formation rates , and galaxy sizes .",
    "by far the strongest correlations are found with measures of surface density .",
    "given the size evolution of galaxies with cosmic time ( e.g. , van der wel et al .",
    "2014 ) , it is entirely plausible that the redshift trends described in this section arise at least in part as an indirect imprint of such an underlying relation with surface density .",
    "figure  [ corr_surfdens.fig ] contrasts the stellar and baryonic mass fractions to the surface density of different mass components .",
    "the strongest correlations ( @xmath156 ) are observed between @xmath93 and @xmath157 on the one hand , and @xmath95 and @xmath158 ( or @xmath159 ) on the other hand :    @xmath160\\ \\ \\ \\ \\label{eqn_1 } \\\\ \\noindent \\log(f_{bar } ) & = & -0.14 + 0.52 [ \\log(\\sigma_{gas } ) - 8.5 ] \\label{eqn_2 } \\\\ \\noindent \\log(f_{bar } ) & = & -0.34 + 0.51 [ \\log(\\sigma_{bar } ) - 8.5 ] \\label{eqn_3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with uncertainties on the intercept and slope of 0.01 and 0.03 , respectively . as the error",
    "ellipses illustrate , uncertainties along both axes are not independent given shared information , but the dynamic range of the observed correlations significantly exceeds what is expected from correlated uncertainties , boosting confidence in the physical reality of the observed trends .",
    "it is noteworthy that the correlations with surface density are stronger than if one considers the total mass of the respective components .    at stellar surface densities of around @xmath161 ,",
    "most of the dynamical mass can be accounted for by stars .",
    "this reduces to of order 10% when considering the subset of galaxies with the most diffuse stellar distributions ( @xmath162 ) . the observed trend echos findings by barro et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who reported higher stellar mass fractions for their sample of 13 compact sfgs than present in a non - compact sfg reference sample .",

    "similar to the @xmath163 relation , our analysis implies that baryons contribute a progressively larger fraction of the total mass budget as gas and/or baryonic surface densities increase .",
    "if we were to adopt the inverted kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation to derive gas masses , a significant positive correlation between @xmath95 and @xmath164 remains , albeit with a slightly reduced pearson correlation coefficient ( r = 0.63 ) .",
    "the @xmath163 relation obviously remains unaffected .",
    "a plausible interpretation of the observed relations is that for high surface density systems , the visible extent of the galaxy traced by the h@xmath18 and @xmath23-band emission probes mostly the inner , baryon - dominated part of the halo .",
    "more diffuse , lower surface density systems will probe further into the halo , where dark matter makes up a larger fraction of the mass budget .",
    "in the previous section , we described a picture of baryonic distributions of varying size embedded in larger scale dark matter halos .",
    "while this can at least in qualitative terms explain the presence of a relation between the surface density and the baryonic mass fraction within the visible extent of our galaxies , it can by itself not be responsible for the @xmath103 values seen at high inferred gas surface densities .",
    "those are by definition unphysical . at @xmath165 ,",
    "such cases make up 70% of the galaxies . here , we briefly discuss which factors , other than random uncertainties scattering baryon - dominated sources above the physical limit , may contribute to their presence .",
    "stellar masses computed through sed modeling are subject to several potential systematic uncertainties ( see , e.g. , wuyts et al .",
    ". however , most of these have the tendency to lead to underestimates rather than overestimates of the true mass present . e.g. , if the true imf follows a salpeter ( 1955 ) rather than the adopted chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , if the true star formation history features bursts on top of an underlying older stellar population , or if the dust distribution is such that the total amount of attenuation could not be recovered . in these scenarios ,",
    "the tension with dynamical constraints would be amplified instead of remedied .",
    "some imf studies of nearby early - type galaxies with @xmath166 favor an even more bottom - heavy imf than salpeter , with mass - to - light ratios being larger by up to a factor of 2 ( spiniello et al . 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ; ferreras et al .",
    "if the stars in those galaxies were formed at the redshifts and in the type of galaxies contained within our kmos@xmath32 sample , this would naturally enhance tensions with dynamical constraints further .",
    "sps models by maraston ( 2005 ) instead of bc03 would reduce the stellar masses of the galaxies in our sample by a factor 1.4 .",
    "we note , however , that recent spectroscopic ( zibetti et al .",
    "2013 ) and spectro - photometric ( kriek et al . 2010 ) studies of post - starburst galaxies seem to favor bc03 models , in that they exhibit relatively low rest - frame near - infrared luminosities and lack the prominent co bandheads characteristic for the m05 models in that wavelength regime ( although see also capozzi et al .",
    "2016 for an opposing view ) .",
    "turning to the gaseous mass component , we remind the reader that we only accounted for gas in the molecular phase .",
    "atomic ( hi ) gas columns in nearby galaxies have been shown to saturate at around @xmath167 ( bigiel & blitz 2012 ) , corresponding to the threshold for the atomic to molecular gas transition ( krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ; sternberg et al .",
    "high - redshift galaxies significantly exceed this threshold surface density , and are therefore expected to be entirely dominated by gas in the molecular phase within their visible region ( see also bauermeister et al .",

    "the baryonic mass would consequently rise by a factor of 1.06 in the median , and a maximum increase of @xmath169 for the least massive galaxies in our sample .",
    "we conclude that contributions from atomic gas may have a minor , but not dominant impact on the assessment of the mass budget within the central few scale lengths of early disks",
    ". moreover , the effect would again be to increase the overall baryonic mass , as would also be the case if a substantial fraction of the molecular hydrogen is not traced by co ( or dust ) ( see bolatto et al .",

    "in contrast to the above effects , a bias yielding over- rather than underestimated @xmath63 would have to be invoked to explain the presence of @xmath103 galaxies .",
    "the gas scaling relations we adopted were parameterized in terms of redshift , stellar mass and star formation rate , without further regard to galaxy size . for the dust - based method it relied on stacked far - infrared seds in bins of ( z , sfr , @xmath62 ) . while galaxy size itself shows systematic variations depending on these three parameters ( wuyts et al .",

    "the most compact and therefore highest surface density ones within each bin necessarily have the shortest dynamical time , and may therefore be expected to have a higher star formation efficiency than average ( genzel et al .",
    "likewise , they may feature a higher dust temperature than the average _ herschel _ stacked sed , and potentially a higher excitation and/or lower conversion factor in the case of the co - based gas method . a higher star formation efficiency for such dense systems would translate to lower gas reservoirs and hence a reduced tension with dynamical constraints .    in figure  [ ks.fig ]",
    ", we briefly explore what star formation efficiencies would have to be invoked in order to bring the baryonic mass budget into agreement with the dynamical constraints .",
    "that is , we contrast the location of @xmath103 galaxies on the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) diagram for gas reservoirs inferred from the co- and dust - based scaling relations ( empty black circles ) , to an alternative realization where we neglect for simplicity the presence of dark matter , and equate @xmath170 ( red filled circles ) .",
    "this exercise is akin to downes & solomon ( 1998 ) who used dynamical mass estimates to constrain gas masses and star formation efficiencies in nearby ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies .",
    "naturally , any presence of dark matter within the inner regions of the galaxy would boost the star formation efficiency implied by the latter method .    with the exception of a dozen outliers which already have @xmath171 , the majority of @xmath103 objects now range from the ks relation for normal sfgs defined by genzel et al .",

    "we point out that the observed increase of @xmath95 with redshift ( figure  [ zevol_parent.fig ] , bottom - right panel ) is therefore inherently linked to the larger gas reservoirs in disk galaxies at early times , inferred from our scaling relation methodology to derive @xmath63 . on the one hand , it is encouraging that independent observations of co and dust continuum tracers , the combination of which is parameterized by the adopted scaling relation , consistently suggest rapidly rising gas fractions with lookback time , as also anticipated from enhanced cosmological accretion rates at high redshift ( see , e.g. , dekel et al .",

    "considering the simulated galaxy population more massive than @xmath154 , no significant dependence of the stellar and baryonic mass fractions on redshift is found for sfgs ( defined as @xmath174 ) .",
    "at all redshifts , the mass fractions in quiescent galaxies , and particularly the contribution of the stellar component , is elevated with respect to that of the star - forming population .",
    "since our kmos@xmath32 sample does not represent a random drawing from the galaxy stellar mass function , but features sfgs with a relatively flat mass distribution ( see section  [ sample.sec ] ) , we carry out a more consistent comparison by creating a ( @xmath175)-matched sample containing 10 illustris galaxies for each observed kmos@xmath32 galaxy .",

    "quantitatively , however , significant differences are notable .",
    "the equivalent relations to those described by equations  [ eqn_1 ] -  [ eqn_3 ] for the observed galaxy population feature shallower slopes for the simulated galaxies , of @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 .",

    "2014 ; genzel et al .",
    "2015 ) , systematic variations are notable . in part , these reflect the above - described correlations with surface density .",
    "for example , the iso-@xmath93 contours of simulated galaxies in the top panel of figure  [ illustris_sfrm.fig ] coincide more or less with lines of constant stellar surface mass density ( see also brennan et al .",

    "we conclude that overall , galaxies as simulated in state - of - the - art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations share many qualitative similarities with their counterparts in the real universe , in terms of their mass budget breakdown and relation to other galaxy parameters .",

    "multi - object spectrographs such as the 24-ifu kmos instrument on the vlt are opening a window on the dynamical mass budget of distant galaxies for samples of increasing statistical significance . in this paper",
    ", we carried out detailed dynamical modeling of 240 massive ( @xmath185 ) star - forming disks from the kmos@xmath32 survey , spanning a wide redshift range of @xmath0 and extending in the median out to @xmath186 kpc .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    @xmath187 over the full redshift range , distant star - forming disk galaxies leave significant room for other mass components than stars within their visible extent . adopting a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf , stars on average account for a third of the total mass budget .",
    "@xmath187 folding in molecular gas masses derived from co- and dust - based gas scaling relations , we find baryons ( i.e. , gas plus stars ) to account for typically 56% of the total mass budget , increasing with redshift such that star - forming disk galaxies at @xmath7 are fully baryon - dominated , with little room for significant dark matter contributions within their inner regions ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "@xmath187 in order to estimate the evolution for the overall underlying population , we compose a mass - complete sample of sfgs from the 3d - hst / candels data set , and assign stellar and baryonic mass fractions to each based on the kmos@xmath32 galaxy from our sample that is best matched in its intrinsic properties .",
    "this approach does not significantly alter our conclusions .",
    "likewise , if adopting an evolving mass limit to trace the progenitors of today s @xmath155 galaxy population , a similar redshift evolution of baryonic mass fractions is inferred .",
    "@xmath187 the inference of missing mass components ( particularly if only the stellar mass is contrasted to the dynamical constraints ) can not be attributed to systematics in the galaxy inclinations , estimated from axial ratio measurements .",

    "@xmath187 a large ( @xmath189 dex ) galaxy - to - galaxy scatter is noted in the stellar and baryonic mass fractions .",
    "these variations are not random , but correlate with galaxy properties , most strongly so with measures of surface density .",
    "systems with compact stellar distributions feature the largest stellar mass fractions .",
    "the highest baryonic mass fractions occur for galaxies with the highest inferred gas ( and baryonic ) surface densities .",
    "the observed trends are in line with a scenario in which our kinematic tracer probes further into the dark matter halo in which the galaxy is embedded if the galaxy s stellar and baryonic distributions are extended , whereas in the case of compact and high surface density systems it is the heavily baryon - dominated inner region that is probed .",
    "similarly strong correlations between mass fractions within @xmath8 and surface density also follow naturally from the physical models with which baryons are traced in a @xmath172cdm context within the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation illustris .",

    "looking ahead , systematic observing campaigns of dust continuum and molecular line tracers with pdbi / noema and alma sampling galaxies over a wide range of redshift , stellar population and structural properties will tighten the constraints on gas and hence baryonic mass estimates further , including also a direct assessment of its spatial distribution ( e.g. , barro et al .",

    "we tested the potential impact on the recovered dynamical masses by taking the best - fit disk models for the 31 largest galaxies ( those with @xmath190 ) , applying noise at a level appropriate for our observations , and fitting them over the full radial extent , over the actual radial extent probed in our observations , and , for illustrative purposes , over a more severely restricted radial extent with the outer kinematic extractions at @xmath191 .",

    "<S> we exploit deep integral - field spectroscopic observations with kmos / vlt of 240 star - forming disks at @xmath0 to dynamically constrain their mass budget . </S>",
    "<S> our sample consists of massive ( @xmath1 ) galaxies with sizes @xmath2 kpc . by contrasting the observed velocity and dispersion profiles to dynamical models </S>",
    "<S> , we find that on average the stellar content contributes @xmath3 of the total dynamical mass , with a significant spread among galaxies ( 68th percentile range @xmath4 ) . including molecular gas </S>",
    "<S> as inferred from co- and dust - based scaling relations , the estimated baryonic mass adds up to @xmath5 of total for the typical galaxy in our sample , reaching @xmath6 at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that baryons make up most of the mass within the disk regions of high - redshift star - forming disk galaxies , with typical disks at @xmath7 being strongly baryon - dominated within @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> substantial object - to - object variations in both stellar and baryonic mass fractions are observed among the galaxies in our sample , larger than what can be accounted for by the formal uncertainties in their respective measurements . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the mass fractions correlate most strongly with measures of surface density . </S>",
    "<S> high @xmath9 galaxies feature stellar mass fractions closer to unity , and systems with high inferred gas or baryonic surface densities leave less room for additional mass components other than stars and molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> our findings can be interpreted as more extended disks probing further ( and more compact disks probing less far ) into the dark matter halos that host them . </S>"
