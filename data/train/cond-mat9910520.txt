    "the rapid accumulation of dna sequence data in the last two decades resulted in a shift of emphasis in population genetics from a prospective approach , which focuses on the changes in the population composition with time , to a retrospective approach , which explores the patterns of similarities between the different sequences to obtain information about the evolutionary history of those sequences . although neutral genealogical processes have been the subject of much attention in those decades , culminating with kingman s coalescent theory @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) , very little is known about genealogical processes with selection ( see @xcite for a few exceptions ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study numerically the effect of selection on two widely used summary statistics for nucleotide variation in a random sample of two genes , namely , the mean time since their most recent common ancestor , @xmath3 , and the average distance ( measured by the number of different nucleotides in homologous sites ) between them , @xmath4 .",
    "this last quantity is easily measured from dna sequence data and , within the neutral evolution assumption , can be used to estimate the product between the effective population size @xmath5 and the mutation rate per gene per generation @xmath6 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that this estimation procedure holds also in the case of diminishing epistasis , provided that @xmath6 is not too small .",
    "we consider a haploid population of @xmath0 individuals or genes that evolves according to the discrete - time wright - fisher model with selection and mutation @xcite . here",
    ", haploid means that each individual has only one copy of each chromosome as , for instance , the mitochondrial genes which are inherited maternally . in this sense , we will use interchangeably the term gene and individual to refer to the unit of selection .",
    "an individual is represented by an infinite sequence of sites , each labeled @xmath7 or @xmath8 : the bit @xmath7 denotes the original ( ancestral ) type , and the bit @xmath8 a mutant type .",
    "the fitness of an individual with @xmath9 mutations is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the selective advantage per site of the original nucleotide type , and @xmath12 is the epistasis parameter .",
    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to absence of epistasis , i.e. , each new mutation reduces the fitness of the individual by the same amount , irrespective of the number of previous mutations .",
    "the case @xmath14 ( synergistic epistasis ) models the situation where the disadvantageous effect of a new mutation increases with the number of mutations already present , while the case @xmath15 ( diminishing epistasis ) corresponds to the situation where the deleterious effect of a new mutation is attenuated .",
    "the mutation mechanism is such that a mutant offspring gets a mutation at a single new site that has never before seen a mutation .",
    "in particular , we assume that the probability that @xmath9 new mutations occur in one individual is given by the poisson distribution @xmath16 where @xmath6 is the mean number of new mutations per individual per generation .",
    "the relevant quantities that characterize the population are measured after the procedures of selection and mutation , in that order .",
    "the model presented above is the celebrated infinite - sites model @xcite which has been widely used by population geneticists to describe the dna variability observed in samples of genes in the case of neutral mutations ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "in the neutral limit ( @xmath18 ) as well as in the strong - selection limit ( @xmath19 ) we can easily calculate @xmath3 and @xmath4 analytically @xcite . clearly , the value of the epistasis parameter is irrelevant in those limits .",
    "we consider first the neutral limit .",
    "let @xmath20 be the time in generations since the latest common ancestor of individuals @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the following we will calculate the probability @xmath23 that two randomly chosen individuals have @xmath24 .",
    "the notation @xmath25 stands for an average over independent populations .",
    "the probability that two individuals have no common ancestor in the preceding generation is simply @xmath26 .",
    "so for @xmath0 large the probability that their ancestors , @xmath27 generations ago , are all different is @xmath28 .",
    "hence the probability that the latest common ancestor of the two individuals lived exactly at @xmath29 generations ago is given by @xmath30 -    \\left [ 1 -   \\mbox{e}^{-t / n } \\right ] \\approx \\frac{\\mbox{e}^{-t / n}}{n } , \\ ] ] from where we obtain @xmath31 .",
    "the relevant time scale in the neutral case is thus proportional to @xmath0 . the probability distribution @xmath32 , which determines the statistical properties of the genealogies , depends on such factors as the population size , geographic structure and the distribution of fitness among the individuals .",
    "it should be stressed that neutral mutations ( i.e. , mutations that do not affect the fitness of the individuals ) have no effect on the genealogies of random samples @xcite and so eqn .  ( [ anc ] ) holds true irrespective of the value of the mutation rate @xmath6 . of course , the distance ( the number of different nucleotides ) between two sampled sequences depends strongly on the mutation process . for instance , for @xmath33 all sequences in the sample are identical . in the sequel",
    "we will calculate analytically the distribution of distances between two sampled sequences .",
    "we assume that during each time interval @xmath34 , since in that case the relevant time scale is of order of @xmath0 generations , and so it is much larger than the time unit , i.e. , one generation . ]",
    "each sequence has a probability @xmath35 of mutating to a new one that has never before been present in the population .",
    "thus , in the neutral case the probability @xmath36 that a sequence differs from its ancestral on @xmath37 sites after the divergence time @xmath27 obeys the equation @xmath38\\ ] ] whose solution is the poisson distribution @xmath39 hence the average distance between an individual and its ancestor increases linearly with time @xmath40 . in a more general context",
    "the steady accumulation of unfavorable mutations in an asexual population is referred to as the muller s rachet @xcite .",
    "let @xmath41 be the probability that the distance between two sampled individuals is equal @xmath37 .",
    "since in an asexual population the individuals are all descended from a common ancestor at some point in the past we can write @xmath42 using eqns .",
    "( [ anc ] ) and ( [ phif ] ) , the integral can easily be evaluated yielding @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "hence , @xmath45 .",
    "we turn now to the analysis of the strong - selection limit ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "since only individuals with @xmath47 mutations can generate offspring there is no difference in the fitness of the breeding individuals .",
    "this limit is similar to the neutral limit in the sense that the probability of two individuals having the same parent is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of individuals with @xmath47 mutations .",
    "clearly , at any generation @xmath49 is random variable distributed according to the binomial distribution @xmath50 if @xmath6 is of order @xmath8 and @xmath0 is large we have @xmath51 so that @xmath52 .",
    "the probability distribution of the distance @xmath53 between two sampled individuals is equally easy to obtain : it is simply given by @xmath54 so that @xmath55 .",
    "we must note that since the probability of extinction in one generation is @xmath56 , the population will ultimately become extinct in a time of order of @xmath57 .",
    "however , if @xmath6 is not of order of @xmath0 the extinction times become so large that these events can not be observed in the simulations described in the sequel .",
    "at any given time we keep track of the number of mutations @xmath58 on each individual @xmath59 , as well as of the identity of their parents .",
    "this information allows us to obtain the most recent common ancestor of any two individuals and also the distance between them . to create a new generation from a given one we assume , as usual , that the number of offspring that each individual contributes to the new generation is proportional to its relative fitness , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total fitness of the population .",
    "the offspring has all the mutations of its parent plus a random number @xmath9 of new mutations distributed according to the poisson distribution @xmath62 given by eqn .",
    "( [ m ] ) .",
    "the initial population is composed of @xmath0 individuals without mutations whose evolution we follow through typically @xmath63 generations .",
    "we then go backward in time to determine the common ancestors of each pair of individuals .",
    "we typically average our results over @xmath64 independent runs .    here",
    "we present only the results for diminishing epistasis ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "a more complete and detailed discussion will be presented elsewhere . in fig .  1 we show the dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the mutation rate @xmath6 for @xmath66 and several values of the population size @xmath0 .",
    "one the one side , for small @xmath6 we find that both @xmath67 and @xmath4 are practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , similarly to the strong - selection limit , in this regime we find @xmath68 and @xmath69 . on the other side , for @xmath6 large we find a regime reminiscent of the neutral limit , in which @xmath67 becomes independent of the mutation rate . in this case",
    "we can define an effective population size @xmath5 , which depends on @xmath70 and @xmath0 but not on @xmath6 , such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "as expected , we find that @xmath5 decreases with increasing @xmath70 since the number of breeding individuals decreases with @xmath70 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath5 seems to decrease like @xmath73 for @xmath70 not too close @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b the different scaling of @xmath4 with @xmath0 in these two regimes leads to an abrupt increase of this quantity at a finite value of @xmath6 , which may signal the existence of a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit @xmath74 .",
    "we note that these features are not observed for @xmath75 ."
