    "fine structures of huge flux rope are rarely observed in solar corona .",
    "this is possible only after the hot plasma tracked the fine flux tubes and make them visible ( li & zhang 2013 ; joshi et al .",
    "recently , li & zhang ( 2013 ) , examine the fine structure of two flux ropes and found that they are composed of @xmath6 and @xmath7 fine - scale structures having each ends with multiple footpoints .",
    "our observation also show that the compound flux rope has several fine structures with both end of the flux rope consists of multiple foot points ( c.f .",
    ", figures 4f , 5g - h , 6g - h and 13b - d ) .",
    "the compound flux rope shows the stability against the eruption in the corona and make the eruption confined ( c.f .",
    ", figure 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 and animations ) . for",
    "the stable equilibrium the value of decay index of the ambient magnetic field should not exceed the critical value i.e. , 1 for straight current channel and 1.5 for circular current channel depending on the different flux rope geometry ( filippov & den 2001 ; dmoulin & aulanier 2010 ) . to check the stability we have calculated the decay index near the compound flux rope axis and found that the whole axis lies in the region where the value of decay index is less than the critical value ( i.e. , less than 1.5 ) up to 86.4 mm .",
    "our measurements also suggest that the maximum height of the flux rope as well as its axis should be less then 86.4 mm and 43.2 mm coronal heights respectively ( see section 5 for detail ) .",
    "hence , the overlying coronal magnetic field playing an crucial role for the stability of filaments and compound flux rope against torus instability . also , for the kink instability to erupt an flux rope should contain 2 - 3 turns ( trk et al .",
    "but in our observations , we have found that the flux rope has less then two turns ( c.f .",
    ", figure 13 b - d ) , which make the flux rope stable against the kink instability also . in future , in order to understand more clearly the flux rope merging , reconnection and the stability , we are going to simulate these kind of stable flux rope eruptions in the solar corona .",
    "it is observed that in general the northern / southern filaments have dextral / sinistral chirality and hence the negative / positive helicity respectively ( chae 2000 ; pevtsov et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however some authors also reported the signature of reverse characteristics as well as the evidence of mixed helicity in the solar corona ( pevtsov et al .",
    "2003 ; martin 2003 ; muglach et al .",
    "recently , joshi et al . (",
    "2014 ) , also reported the relationship between the filament chirality ( sinistral ) and helicity ( positive ) of flux rope and also found an good correlation . in the present work ,",
    "we have also discussed the relationship between filament chirality and associated flux rope helicity and found a clear relationship . using various observational manifestations",
    "we obtain that the filaments has sinistral chirality ( c.f . , section 4 and figure 12 for more detail ) . from the apparent motion of plasma within the compound flux rope as well as from the complete twisted geometry of flux rope in euv images , it is confirm that the surround magnetic flux rope has positive helicity ( c.f .",
    ", section 4 and figure 13 ) .",
    "overall this observation is an another clear example showing the relationship between chirality and helicity .",
    "more observational and simulation work are needed in order to understand the filaments interaction / merging dynamics in detail .",
    "the eruption of such big disk center filaments and flux ropes are mainly responsible for the fast earth - directed cmes and other interplanetary and near earth consequences .",
    "however , sometime they remain stable under the coronal magnetic field conditions .",
    "therefore , observational studies as well as numerical simulations of filament stabilization / eruption conditions may play an significant role to forecast the initial eruption conditions as well as space weather .",
