    "when governmental bodies like census bureaus collect data there is a tension between publicly releasing as much information as possible while at the same time striving to ensure that any one individual s private data can not be discerned from the released information .",
    "one such case of this is when each piece of private data is recorded in a cell in a multi - dimensional contingency table and the released data is a collection of smaller margin tables ( or simply _ margins _ ) which portray the interactions between some subsets of the variables .",
    "these margins are simply higher dimensional analogues of row sums and column sums on the contingency table .",
    "so how would we know that a person s individual data is protected despite the release of possibly many margins  ?",
    "there are many criteria that may have to be accounted for in limiting the disclosure of private data : see for example @xcite on issues with small cell counts in sparse contingency tables , or see @xcite for privacy concerns in genetic databases ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 5 ) for an introductory discussion ) .",
    "one such measure is the practical difficulty in attaining bounds for cell entries that can be discerned from the released margins .",
    "one way in which these bounds can be found is from standard methods in integer programming but solving the general integer program has a theoretical complexity of np - complete @xcite and , practically speaking , are very challenging to solve . on the other hand , linear programs can be solved in polynomial time and there is significant high - powered software designed specifically to practically solve linear programs .",
    "so one must know if the linear relaxations of the integer programs associated to disclosure limitation are _ always _ good approximations for bounding cells in contingency tables .",
    "based on theoretical results for @xmath0-way tables and practical experience on higher dimensional contingency tables , it was thought ( @xcite , @xcite ) that the linear approximation was always reliable for bounding cells . from a purely integer programming perspective",
    ", this also looks reasonable at first glance as the integer programs in question consist of highly sparse , highly symmetric @xmath1 constraint matrices and highly degenerate cost vector consisting of one @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 ) in the first position and @xmath4 s in all other positions .",
    "however , using gr \" obner basis techniques , sullivant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) constructed a family of contingency tables on @xmath5 binary random variables with a specified collection of margins , denoted by @xmath6 , such that the gap between the linear programming approximation of the cell bounds and the true integer programming cell bound for one of these margins is @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we are not entitled to _",
    "always _ assume that the linear approximation of the bounds on cell entries is a faithful approximation to the true bounds on these cell entries .",
    "all that said , perhaps the reason for @xcite & @xcite thinking that the linear approximation was reliable for bounding cell entries was that , in their practical experience , margins with large gaps were never encountered .",
    "instead , perhaps the right claim for the practitioners to make is that the linear relaxations of the integer programs associated to disclosure limitation are _ almost always _ good approximations for bounding cells in contingency tables . in other words , while it is the case that sullivant s specified margins do indeed provide examples of the linear approximation being poor , these margins may be rarely encountered in practice .",
    "we argue here that this is the case for sullivant s large gaps and thus reopening the question of _ whether linear programming is an effective heuristic for detecting disclosures when releasing margins of multi - way tables _ :    [ thm : main ] the margins for sullivant s @xmath8-gaps on the models @xmath9 are rare .",
    "we will make the notion of _ rare _ precise through _ standard pairs_. in the sections that follow we will first review and fortify sullivant s construction .",
    "next , after defining standard pairs and arguing that they are the right tool to use for measuring _ rarity _ , we will prove theorem  [ thm : main ] using a series of propositions regarding standard pairs specific to the strengthened sullivant construction .",
    "we will see that the strengthened construction is not just made for its own sake but is crucial to proving theorem  [ thm : main ] .",

    "there are a number of things to note from the above analysis of the @xmath8-margins .",

    "however , given that released margins with large norms will come from tables with large cell counts ( which are harder to bound tightly and are consequently more secure ) , the asymptotic results are not relevant thus justifying the need for the analysis above .",
    "also note that since the cone is shifted significantly from the origin then the @xmath8-margins only start to appear in @xmath160 slices for @xmath177 and so on contingency tables with mostly small counts , instances of these large gaps will never be encountered .",
    "contingency tables with small cell counts are common in practice ( see , for example , @xcite ) which could give a further explanation as to why the large gaps are not encountered in practice .",
    "finally , we noted that a _ random uniform choice _ of margin in @xmath160 is highly unlikely to pick out a @xmath8-margin but there may be some prior distribution on the margins that is not uniform .",
    "a very reasonable assumption , based on sums being distributed normally , is that the margins that are most frequently encountered are those in the _ centre _ of @xmath168 but in our instance the @xmath8-margins appear in a shifted cone , shifted in a highly skewed fashion away from the centre of @xmath168 along one of the extreme rays of that cone .",
