    "condensed matters in solid state usually have the structure of a crystal : the molecules are arranged in some regular pattern .",
    "real crystals are in fact not perfectly regular , but form a perturbation of the pattern",
    ". they also have defects .",
    "one can describe a crystal using the fundamental approach of statistical mechanics .",
    "some probability distributions determine the location of the molecules .",
    "their local interaction should specify the distribution .",
    "one wants to extract the global behaviour of the crystal from these local interactions .",
    "this is not well understood in a mathematically rigorous sense yet .",
    "one question to tackle is whether the crystal globally preserves or breaks symmetries of the local interactions .",
    "richthammer showed that the translational symmetry is preserved in a quite general two - dimensional setting , see @xcite .",
    "but in the case of rotational symmetry one expects a different outcome : rotational symmetry should be broken .",
    "merkl and rolles showed this for a toy model of a crystal without defects in @xcite .",
    "this was extended by heydenreich , merkl and rolles in @xcite to a model which allows simple defects .    in the present work",
    ", it is shown that the rotational symmetry is broken ( in a weaker form ) for a class of models where almost all kinds of defects are allowed .",
    "let us describe this class informally .",
    "a model consists of a tessellation , some local hamiltonians , a measure for the surface of the defects and some parameters .",
    "the crystal shall have a favourite structure , which depends on the considered matter and is described by the tessellation .",
    "thus the molecules form locally a perturbation of the tessellation .",
    "a local perturbation costs some energy , which is described by the local hamiltonians . as already mentioned , the crystal may have various defects .",
    "in particular , there may be edge , screw and mixed dislocations , i.e.  defects with burgers vectors , as well as large unbounded defects .",
    "we only require that the size of a defect is larger than an arbitrary small , but fixed number .",
    "a defect is punished proportional to the size of its surface .",
    "this can be interpreted as a surface tension . moreover , there is a chemical potential which favours a large number of molecules .",
    "let us be a bit more precise .",
    "the crystal lives in a @xmath0-dimensional box ( @xmath1 ) of size @xmath2 ( with periodic boundary ) , and the centre of the molecules are given by a random set @xmath3 of points in the box .",
    "a point configuration @xmath3 determines a set @xmath4 of tiles , which are locally a perturbation of the tessellation .",
    "furthermore , it determines the quantity @xmath5 measuring the surface of the defects . the local hamiltonian @xmath6 gives the energy costs of the perturbed tile @xmath7 in any way which fulfil a reasonable inequality .",
    "then the global hamiltonian is defined by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the three addends describe the local perturbation , the surface energy and a chemical potential . using a possion point process @xmath11 in the box as reference measure , the probability measure @xmath12",
    "is given by @xmath13 with inverse temperature @xmath14 and partition sum @xmath15 .",
    "then we show ( theorem  [ thm : symmetrybreaking ] ) that there exists @xmath16 such that for all @xmath17 @xmath18 \\;=\\ ; 0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 measures point - wise the deformation ( rotation and scaling ) of the crystal .",
    "thus the crystal is globally close to a constant rotation @xmath20 , i.e.  there is a long - range order in the crystal .",
    "but if the local hamiltonians and the surface measure are chosen rotational invariant , which is possible and reasonable , the global hamiltonian is rotational symmetric .",
    "therefore the rotational symmetry is broken .    in order to prove this result",
    ", we follow the approach of heydenreich , merkl and rolles .",
    "their main ingredient is the theorem on geometric rigidity of friesecke , james and mller ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) .",
    "we first prove a more general rigidity estimate described below and apply it to prove the result stated above , using a more or less similar technique as heydenreich , merkl and rolles .",
    "the main constraint of our theorem is that the limit is not uniform in the box size : @xmath21 depends on @xmath2 . but with the chosen method this is the best possible result , since one constant in the rigidity estimate is not scale - invariant . in order to get results uniform in the size of the box",
    ", one might have to use much more involved approaches like renormalisation .",
    "the already mentioned rigidity estimate is the other goal of this article .",
    "results on geometric rigidity go back to a theorem of liouville .",
    "it states that if the derivative of a smooth function @xmath22 is point - wise a rotation , then the function is globally a rigid motion , i.e.  its derivative is everywhere the same rotation .",
    "a major step further was the now classical rigidity estimate of friesecke , james and mller ( * ? ? ? * theorem  3.1 ) .",
    "they bounded the @xmath23-distance of the derivative from a constant rotation by a constant times the @xmath23-distance from the whole rotation group @xmath24 .",
    "this was further generalised by mller , scardia and zeppieri to fields with non - zero curl , at least in dimension @xmath25 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.3 ) .",
    "here we consider matrix - valued functions @xmath26 on an open , connected and bounded set @xmath27 with smooth boundary in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we also identify such a function line by line with a vector of @xmath28-forms .",
    "we show ( theorem  [ thm : rigidity ] ) that the @xmath23-distance of @xmath29 from a single constant rotation @xmath20 is bounded by the sum of a constant times the @xmath23-distance of @xmath29 from the rotation group @xmath24 and another constant times the @xmath30-norm ( with @xmath31 ) of the ( component - wise ) exterior derivative @xmath32 of @xmath29 .",
    "we also determine the scaling of the constants ( lemma  [ lem : scale ] ) .",
    "note that one of them is not scale - invariant .",
    "if @xmath33 for some function @xmath34 ( which implies @xmath35 ) , this estimate reduces to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) .",
    "it is also an extension of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.3 ) , which handles the case @xmath25 and @xmath36 .",
    "this rigidity estimate is the content of chapter  [ cha : rigidity ] . in chapter  [ cha : symmetrybreaking ] we state",
    "the considered class of crystal models accurately and prove the result on the spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry .",
    "finally we give two examples of concrete models .",
    "first we consider the two - dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "this yields a model analogous to the model considered in @xcite .",
    "then we draw our attention to a crystal whose favourite structure is the @xmath0-dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "let @xmath1 .",
    "we work with functions mapping to @xmath37 defined on an open , connected and bounded set @xmath27 with smooth boundary .",
    "we identify such a matrix - valued function @xmath38 line by line with a vector @xmath39 of 1-forms @xmath40 . then the exterior derivative @xmath41 is a vector of 2-forms with components @xmath42 if the derivatives exist . for @xmath43 ,",
    "its @xmath44-norm is defined by @xmath45 we say that @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 for some @xmath43 if there exist smooth functions @xmath48 , @xmath49 , such that @xmath50 in @xmath23 as @xmath51 and such that @xmath52 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath30 .",
    "in that case we define @xmath53 .",
    "this limit is well - defined by the following remark .    for @xmath54 ,",
    "let @xmath55 denote the space of @xmath56-forms on @xmath57 whose coefficients are in @xmath58 .",
    "other spaces of @xmath56-forms are defined analogously .",
    "let @xmath59 be a 1-form .",
    "then a @xmath60-form @xmath61 is the exterior derivative of @xmath62 in the weak sense , i.e.  @xmath63 , if @xmath64 holds for all @xmath60-forms @xmath65 , where the codifferential @xmath66 is the adjoint operator to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the weak exterior derivative is unique . in particular , if there are smooth @xmath28-forms @xmath67 such that @xmath68 in @xmath23 and @xmath69 in @xmath30 for a @xmath60-form @xmath70 , then @xmath71 .",
    "thus the limit is well - defined .",
    "note that we did not require that the weak exterior derivative @xmath61 of @xmath62 is in @xmath30 , but we imposed the possibly stronger condition that we can approximate @xmath62 with smooth @xmath28-forms whose exterior derivatives converge in @xmath30 .",

    "though not formally stated , his results also hold if the boundary is only piecewise smooth . in @xcite mitrea ,",
    "mitrea and monniaux considered similar problems as in @xcite , but for domains with lipschitz boundary .",
    "unfortunately they do not state the exact lemma we need . since a smooth boundary is sufficient for our purposes ,",
    "we stick to that case , where the needed lemma is explicitly stated in the literature .",
    "it is also possible to generalise theorem  [ thm : rigidity ] in another direction .",
    "if @xmath57 is a flat manifold , which means that all transition maps are just translations , then it makes sense to speak about global rotations .",

    "the remaining `` holes '' are the defects .",
    "almost all defects are feasible .",
    "we only require that each defect has a minimum size , i.e.  the boundary of a defect does not come closer than @xmath238 to itself ( for some fixed @xmath239 ) .",
    "but the defects may be arbitrarily large and may also have burgers vectors .",
    "thus there may exist edge , screw and also mixed dislocations .",
    "we assume that the crystal is connected and sufficiently large , i.e.  its size is comparable to the size of the box .",
    "the distribution of the points is given in the gibbsian setting using a poisson point process as reference measure .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of three parts .",

    "it punishes defects proportional to their surface .",
    "the last part of the hamiltonian can be thought as a chemical potential ; increasing it favours more points .",

    "first we define a set @xmath277 which contains all possibly perturbed tiles whose corners are taken from the point configuration . here",
    "we do not impose any condition on the relative locations of the perturbed tiles to each other .",
    "but we do impose such conditions in the next step , in which we define when a subset @xmath278 is called a locally @xmath246-like set of tiles : locally , the relative locations of the tiles must be such as in @xmath246 . finally we define a particular locally @xmath246-like set of tiles @xmath4 , which is the set containing all perturbed tiles of the crystal .",
    "it is a maximal locally @xmath246-like set of tiles under the conditions that it is connected and that the tiles are not too close to each other ( at the boundary of the defects ) .          before stating the precise definitions , we give an example .",
    "the underlying tessellation is just the two - dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "we start with a random point configuration ( with periodic boundary condition ) which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : config ] .",
    "then the set @xmath277 of all possibly perturbed tiles contains all triangles ( 3 points connected by lines ) in figure  [ fig : tdach ] , regardless whether they are white or grey shaded .",
    "note that there is a quadrilateral just right to the upper right grey shaded area .",
    "it is not included in @xmath277 as it is not a triangle .",
    "similarly , the big 13-gon is not included , but the triangle inside is . in the grey shaded regions , @xmath277 does not look like the triangular lattice since the triangles do overlap or there is an interior vertex with five or seven adjacent triangles .",
    "therefore , we have to omit some triangles in the grey shaded regions in order to get a locally @xmath246-like set of tiles . finally , the crystal @xmath4 is drawn in figure  [ fig : t ] .",
    "it contains all white triangles .",
    "the grey shaded regions ( including the grey triangle ) are the defects of the crystal .",
    "the triangle formed by the three points inside the huge defect is not included since the crystal must be connected .",
    "furthermore , @xmath277 contains two triangles using the point inside the upper right defect .",
    "but they are not included in @xmath4 since otherwise some triangles would be too close to each other .",
    "now we state the precise definitions .",
    "let @xmath280 be the set of all possibly perturbed tiles .",
    "any subset @xmath281 is called a locally @xmath246-like set of tiles , if for @xmath282 ( with some @xmath283 ) , there are are sets @xmath284 , @xmath285 and continuous bijective maps @xmath286 mapping each tile @xmath287 to a tile @xmath288 ( with some @xmath289 ) such that @xmath290 and the sets @xmath291 do overlap , i.e.  all intersections @xmath292 consist only of whole tiles if they are not empty .",
    "thus @xmath293 is a locally @xmath246-like set of tiles if it looks locally like @xmath246 .",
    "now we define @xmath276 to be a largest subset of @xmath277 such that            here `` a largest subset '' is understood as a subset whose cardinality ( number of tiles ) is maximal under all subsets with these properties .",
    "in fact , there need not exist a unique largest subset .",
    "in that case , we choose one of them according to some fixed rule .",
    "furthermore , we define the set of surface points of @xmath3 as follows : @xmath305 where @xmath306 denotes the topological boundary of the set @xmath294 and @xmath307 is the set of points of @xmath3 , which are vertices of any tile @xmath298 . in the example above , the surface points are drawn in grey in figure  [ fig : t ] .",
    "note that there are surface points which are not vertices of any tile .",
    "we will call such surface points also exterior points ( though they can also lie inside the crystal , as one of them does in the example ) .",
    "such points are possible , but will be unlikely .",

    "otherwise even the points of @xmath246 would not compose a huge crystal .",
    "note that we do not require a minimal distance between two points and that there may exist points inside a tile which do not belong to the tile .",
    "but all such points are included in the surface points @xmath279 , which consists not only of the surface vertices of @xmath4 , but also of the points not belonging to any tile .",
    "now we define a random function @xmath312 which measures the local deformation ( rotation and scaling ) of the crystal .",
    "thereto , for @xmath248 , we partition the tile @xmath258 into simplices @xmath313 . for any @xmath287",
    "we define the bijective map @xmath314 such that its restriction to @xmath315 $ ] is affine linear for each @xmath316 . using these maps ,",

    "then @xmath29 is a piecewise constant function on @xmath294 .",
    "though it is locally defined as a derivative , it is , in general , globally not a derivative , since there may be defects with burgers vectors .",
    "we assume that some local hamiltonians @xmath319 are given which are continuous and fulfil @xmath320 a tile @xmath298 satisfies @xmath321 .",
    "therefore @xmath322 for some @xmath323 , @xmath20 and @xmath324 .",

    "we extend @xmath328 , @xmath248 , to @xmath4 by setting @xmath329 .",

    "the first addend measures the local energy of the crystal caused by the perturbation of @xmath246 .",
    "the term @xmath333 represents the surface energy .",
    "finally , @xmath334 can be interpreted as a chemical potential . using this hamiltonian we define for @xmath14 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath266 the partition sum @xmath335 and the probability measure @xmath12 via @xmath336 let @xmath337 denote the expectation with respect to @xmath12 .",

    "the main constraint of this theorem is that the estimate is not uniform in the size of the box since @xmath21 depends on @xmath2 .",
    "thus it does not carry over to infinite - volume limits .",
    "the reason for that @xmath2-dependency lies in the scaling behaviour of the constants in theorem  [ thm : rigidity ] as stated in lemma  [ lem : scale ] .",
    "it is not possible to get better results using the chosen method .",
    "another constraint is that we assumed or rather conditioned on the event that the size of the crystal is comparable to the box size , i.e.  @xmath349 . whether this event has large probability is a different topic and not discussed in this article .",
    "but one might expect that its probability is large if the chemical potential @xmath334 is large enough .",
    "then more points are more likely and they should form more tiles , since otherwise they are surface points which are punished with @xmath350 .    let us further remark , that the crystal consists only of enlarged perturbed tiles , i.e.  the lebesgue measure of any perturbed tile must not be smaller than the lebesgue measure of the corresponding standard tile .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to cover the whole box with more tiles than the standard tessellation would need .",
    "this may be considered as a hard - core condition .",
    "furthermore , the whole perturbed tile must be @xmath237-close to a standard tile .",
    "for instance , the postulate that only the edge lengths are close to the corresponding standard edge lengths might not be enough .",

    "if the crystal consists of two components , for example , there is no reason why one could use the same rotation @xmath326 for both components .",
    "indeed , the second component could be a rotated copy of the first one .    finally , we equipped the box @xmath235 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this has in particular the advantage that configurations without defects have no boundary , which is a technical relaxation , especially in lemma  [ lem : partitionsum ] .",
    "otherwise , the periodic boundary is not essentially used .    despite these constraints , especially the non - uniformity in @xmath2 ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : symmetrybreaking ] has the feature that it handles almost all kinds of defects , including unbounded and dislocation defects .",
    "up to the author s knowledge , it is the first result on spontaneous symmetry breaking allowing such general defects .",
    "before we start the proof , we give an overview .",
    "generally , we prove theorem  [ thm : symmetrybreaking ] using more or less the same approach as heydenreich , merkl and rolles used in @xcite .",
    "but the implementation of that approach is different .",
    "one main difference is that we work directly on the level of the derivatives : indeed @xmath29 is matrix - valued and locally the derivative of a function @xmath351 .",
    "but globally , @xmath29 need not be any derivative .",
    "moreover , @xmath351 is the inverse of the corresponding function in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is no reference lattice .",
    "first we extend the function @xmath29 into the defects in subsection  [ sec : extensionv ] .",
    "thereto we use a tube - neighbourhood of @xmath294 .",
    "this extension is different to the extension in @xcite since we consider different kinds of defects . in subsection",
    "[ sec : cardinality ] we define the standard configuration and estimate the cardinality of some subsets of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; this section has no counterpart in @xcite .",
    "afterwards , in subsection  [ sec : estimateh ] , we prove an estimate for the hamiltonian , which is an analogue to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3.2 ) .",
    "though its proof is different , it uses the same general idea , namely to apply a rigidity estimate . in subsection",

    "the proofs of these results , which are analogues to ( * ? ? ?",

    "* lemma  3.3 ) , respectively , use ideas from their proofs .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ sec : results ] , we prove a corollary which states the main result in different forms and also implies theorem  [ thm : symmetrybreaking ] .    in the following we need quite a lot different constants . unless explicitly stated , they are all uniform constants .",
    "almost all of them depend on the model , i.e.  on the tessellation , the local hamiltonians , the surface measure @xmath5 or on the constants @xmath352 .",

    "most of the constants are positive , but some can be any real number . in that case",
    "the constant has a little @xmath353 as superscript .",
    "first we want to extend the random function @xmath312 , which measures the local deformation of the crystal , into the defects .",
