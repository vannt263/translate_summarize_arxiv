    "strongly interacting matter , as described by qcd , exhibits an astonishingly rich phase structure . in the region of not too large baryon densities ,",
    "the deconfinement transition from hadronic matter to a plasma built of quark - gluon constituents is the most prominent feature .",
    "it is signalled by a rapid change in the expectation value of the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate where one assigns a pseudo - critical temperature @xmath0 to this transition ( cf .",
    "reviews , e.  g.  @xcite ) . at higher temperatures , @xmath1 ,",
    "further structural changes are conjectured @xcite . for non - zero quark",
    "chemical potential @xmath2 , corresponding to a finite net baryon density , many researchers argue on the change of the deconfinement border line , representing an analytic crossover , into a first - order transition curve .",
    "the onset of this sequence of first - order transitions is marked by a critical point being of second order which has attracted much attention recently ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in this part of the phase diagram is triggered by the possibility to probe it under laboratory conditions in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    with the advance of precision data from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at rhic ,",
    "the paradigm on the quark - gluon plasma has changed  @xcite : the notion of a strongly coupled plasma has been put forward to explain the seemingly very small viscosity to entropy ratio deduced from hydrodynamical fits to experimental data as in  @xcite , and various models have been developed @xcite to account for such a property .",
    "on the other hand , we are witnessing a vast progress in first principle calculations of thermodynamic properties of hot deconfined strongly interacting matter based directly on qcd @xcite .",
    "while various observables such as pressure , energy density or numerous susceptibilities are addressed , the available lattice qcd data are obtained for different numerical set - ups , lattice sizes , flavor numbers and quark masses as well .",
    "particular attempts are needed to access non - zero baryon densities because the notorious sign problem of the fermion determinant prevents a direct application of methods useful for zero baryon density .",
    "nevertheless , a few methods have been developed to access non - zero baryon densities . among such methods",
    "is the calculation of thermodynamic quantities at purely imaginary chemical potential . here ,",
    "the sign problem is avoided but the results have to be analytically continued to real chemical potential . in this respect it is useful to have a model at our disposal which is successfully probed for both , real and imaginary chemical potential , in order to accomplish the translation of results from imaginary to real chemical potential .    while baryon density effects are small for heavy - ion collisions at top - rhic energies and will be even smaller for lhc energies , at least in the mid - rapidity region , for cern - sps and upcoming fair energies they are sizeable . in this respect ,",
    "a firm knowledge of thermodynamic bulk properties of strongly interacting matter is highly desirable . as a step towards achieving this goal",
    "we are going to extend our quasiparticle model  @xcite to imaginary chemical potential . here , information is obtained for @xmath3 allowing , in principle , for identifying @xmath4 .",
    "the model has been tested successfully for real chemical potential @xcite , say in describing the taylor expansion coefficients of the pressure as a series in powers of @xmath5 .",
    "in such a way , peshier s flow equation @xcite is tested in some detail .",
    "this flow equation transports information about the effective coupling , @xmath6 , from the temperature axis to non - zero @xmath2 and determines to a large extent the dependence on @xmath2 and thus on baryon density .",
    "another important piece of the model is the quasiparticle ansatz for dynamically generated effective masses of quarks @xmath7 .",
    "when going to purely imaginary chemical potential @xmath8 the sign of the @xmath9 term is flipped , as also signs in peshier s flow equation are changed .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 dependence of the model is directly tested by considering an imaginary chemical potential .    in the following , two symmetries of the qcd partition function @xmath10",
    "are of relevance : ( i ) @xmath11 , and ( ii ) @xmath12 , i.  e.  @xmath10 is periodic in @xmath13 with period @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "symmetry ( i ) makes @xmath15 an even function of @xmath2 ( meaning that in a taylor series expansion only even powers of @xmath16 , and thus also of @xmath17 , are encountered ) such that we can focus on @xmath18 only , while ( ii ) implies the roberge - weiss periodicity  @xcite which is anchored in the center symmetry .",
    "this periodicity is characterized by lines of first - order transitions ( @xmath19 transitions ) at @xmath20 for all integers @xmath21 and sufficiently high temperature @xmath22 while for smaller temperatures the behavior of thermodynamic quantities is analytic .",
    "the endpoint of first - order transitions , @xmath23 , is determined by the crossing of the roberge - weiss transition line with the chiral critical line which is also a first - order transition line for @xmath24 degenerate quark flavors  @xcite .",
    "the roberge - weiss periodicity implies that in the @xmath25 plane all sectors between @xmath26 and @xmath27 are copies of the sector between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , the subsector between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is an reflected copy of the subsector between @xmath28 and @xmath30 mirrored at the first roberge - weiss transition line .",
    "as thermodynamic quantities behave non - analytically at @xmath32 ( roberge - weiss transition ) , an analytic continuation of results obtained for imaginary chemical potential to real @xmath2 has direct access to the region @xmath33 only .",
    "due to the severe approximations made when linking our phenomenological model  @xcite to qcd @xcite , the roberge - weiss periodicity is not longer apparent . having this in mind",
    ", we translate the model to imaginary chemical potential in section  [ sec:2 ] . the comparison with lattice qcd data at imaginary chemical potential",
    "is performed in section  [ sec:3 ] , where also the continuation to real chemical potential is presented .",
    "this allows , in addition , for a comparison with another and independent set of lattice qcd data obtained at @xmath34 ( section  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we investigate in detail the impact of the baryo - chemical potential dependence of the quasiquark and quasigluon masses ( selfenergies ) on the found results and discuss the deconfinement border line in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",

    "the qcd running coupling is replaced by an effective coupling @xmath36 which is subject to peshier s flow equation  @xcite resting on a thermodynamic self - consistency condition and the stationarity of the grand canonical potential @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the pressure and @xmath39 the volume of the system .",
