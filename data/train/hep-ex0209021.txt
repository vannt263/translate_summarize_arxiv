    "the standard model ( sm )  @xcite of electroweak interactions is a well established theory which has been very successful in accounting for various experimental observations as well as in its predictions of new physics phenomena .",
    "the unproven keystone of the sm is the mechanism of mass generation .",
    "the most favoured one is the so - called higgs mechanism  @xcite .",
    "a doublet of scalar complex fields with non - zero vacuum expectation value is postulated , breaking electroweak symmetry and generating weak boson and fermion masses .",
    "the higgs mechanism gives rise to one more physical state @xmath0 the higgs boson .",
    "the discovery of this particle would be a crucial step in establishing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and in our understanding of the origin of mass .",
    "one higgs doublet is the minimum which is required to generate weak boson and fermion masses .",
    "there are extensions of the sm postulating additional higgs multiplets and thus predicting a spectrum of physical higgs particles  @xcite . over the last decade searches for higgs bosons of various theoretical models",
    "have been performed at the tevatron @xmath1 collider and the large electron - positron ( lep ) collider .",
    "the results of these searches are reviewed .",
    "over the last three years of lep running , the four lep collaborations , aleph , delphi , l3 and opal , have collected 2460 pb@xmath2 of data at centre - of - mass energies between 189 and 209 gev with about 530 pb@xmath2 above 206 gev .",
    "these data provided sensitivity to the sm higgs boson up to a mass of @xmath3 @xmath4 115 gev .    at lep",
    ", the production of the higgs boson is expected mainly via the higgs - strahlung process , @xmath5 .",
    "the processes of ww and zz fusion , giving rise to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 final states , contribute with a smaller rates to the higgs boson production .",
    "the dependence of the production cross sections on the higgs boson mass at a typical lep energy , attained in the year 2000 , is illustrated in figure  [ fig_sm_hzbran ] ( left ) .",
    "the sm higgs boson decay branching fractions as a function of the higgs boson mass are displayed in figure  [ fig_sm_hzbran ] ( right ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     as one can see , specific choices of parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are possible , which lead to the suppression of the higgs boson couplings to @xmath10 .",
    "sm higgs searches would have a reduced sensitivity in such cases , because of their strong reliance on identification of b - quarks . to investigate these specific scenarios ,",
    "all four lep collaborations have performed flavor independent searches for hadronic decays of the higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "the preliminary lep combination of the search results is done for the higgs - strahlung production mechanism production mechanism individually by delphi , l3 and opal collaborations . however , no lep combined results of these searches are available yet . ]",
    "all decay channels of the z boson are studied and decays of the higgs boson into @xmath10 , @xmath11 and a pair of gluons are considered . none of the lep collaborations observes an indication of a signal and the search results are translated into the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits on the higgs - strahlung cross section .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : lep_flvb ] . assuming sm cross section for the higgs - strahlung process and the hadronic branching fraction of the higgs boson equal 1 , a lower bound of 112.9 gev on the higgs boson mass is obtained at 95% c.l .",
    "regardless of the flavor content of the higgs boson decay products .      at lep , charged higgs bosons are expected to be produced in pairs through virtual z or @xmath12 exchange : @xmath13 . in 2hdm , the @xmath14 mass is not predicted and the tree - level cross - section is fully determined by the mass .",
    "the searches are carried out under the assumption that the two decay modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 exhaust the @xmath17 decay width but the relative branching ratio is regarded as a free parameter .",
    "thus , the searches encompass the following final states : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "an excess of candidates in the pure hadronic channel in the mass region around 68 gev is found in the l3 data  @xcite .",

    "two different searches for @xmath24 are performed at tevatron .",
    "an indirect search  @xcite makes use of the fact that a large branching fraction @xmath26 suppresses decay rates of @xmath32 into the @xmath33 final states .",
