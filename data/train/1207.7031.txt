    "population  i wolf - rayet stars are spectroscopically conspicuous tracers of the upper end of the initial mass function , with progenitor masses believed to be in excess of @xmath125@xmath2  @xcite . in the extragalactic context , wolf - rayet ( wr ) populations are particularly sensitive to metallicity , such that both the number of wrs per unit mass ( or , equivalently , the wr : o - star ratio ) , and the ratio of nitrogen- to carbon - sequence ( wn : wc ) stars vary considerably between the galaxy , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "because of their strong emission - line spectra , wolf - rayets are relatively easy to identify from very - low - dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "the first systematic search for lmc wrs using objective - prism spectroscopy yielded 50 objects @xcite , although many of these had previously been recorded in the henry draper catalogue and its extension ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent objective - prism searches by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite roughly doubled the sample size , with a handful of other observations , including studies in crowded fields , leading to the total of 134 entries in the current , ` bat99 ' , catalogue as a wn3 star with _ extremely",
    "_ weak @xmath34686 emission ( @xmath4 ) , presumably attributable to dilution by the companion , although @xcite were unable to confirm the discovery ; and @xcite report vfts  682 as a new , heavily reddened wn5h star in 30  dor . ] @xcite .    with this tally ,",
    "the lmc wr population is generally considered to be known to a substantial degree of completeness .",
    "any remaining objects are likely to lie in very crowded regions ( although there has been much progress in this direction in the hubble space telescope era ; e.g. , @xcite ) , to be heavily reddened ( although lmc reddening is generally small , and intrinsically reddened wc - late stars are believed to be rare in the lmc ) , to lie in unexamined outskirts of the lmc , or to be weak lined . here",
    "we report the serendipitous discovery of two bright , isolated wne stars .",
    "both are within the area searched by @xcite , but are moderately weak - lined .",
    "we have conducted several programmes of spectroscopic observations of the bright - star content of the lmc ( @xmath5 ) using the 2df and aaomega instruments on the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "the original 2df system was a dual - spectrograph , multi - fibre instrument which allowed up to 400 intermediate - dispersion spectra to be obtained simultaneously across a @xmath6-diameter field of view @xcite ; we used it with 1200b gratings , giving @xmath7 over the wavelength range @xmath138004900 .",
    "aaomega utilises the same fibre - positioner system , but introduces new spectrographs with many innovations , including dichroic beam - splitting which allows blue and red spectra to be recorded simultaneously @xcite .",
    "we used 1700b ( @xmath841004750 ) and 1000r ( @xmath956506800 ) gratings .    although poor weather impacted severely on individual programmes , the powerful multiplexing capability of these instruments has none the less resulted in the accumulation of spectra of tolerable to good quality for more than @xmath13000 early - type stars .",
    "an initial examination of this dataset has revealed two new wr stars .",
    "neither object has any designation from previous surveys listed in the cds _ simbad _ database , so we adopt a nomenclature based on extending the @xcite catalogue .",
    "basic stellar parameters are reported in table  [ tab_one ] , and the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_spec ] .",
    "bat99 - 5a is @xmath10 from lh  5 and its associated  regions lha  120-n83 and n90 @xcite , and is @xmath11 from the cluster ngc  1756 , but there is no obvious physical connection with any of these objects .",
    "bat99 - 15a has no nearby lh associations or lha  regions .",
    "both stars have similar , early wn types ; although our wavelength coverage does nt include the full suite of classification criteria , the lack of detectable  @xmath34057 coupled with moderately strong @xmath124604 , 4620 indicates wn3 , confirmed by weak @xmath125801 , 5812 in the case of bat99 - 15a .",
    "the @xmath124340 , 4860 emissions in bat99 - 15a appear to be stronger than @xmath34541 , suggesting hydrogen balmer emission in addition to  pickering emission ( @xcite ; these lines are too weak in bat99 - 5a to draw conclusions ) ; it also shows weak absorption at h@xmath13h@xmath14 ( and possibly at  @xmath34541 ) , leading to a wn3h+abs classification .",
    "[ the only plausible alternative classifications are as transition of / wn stars ( cf .",
    "although fig  [ fig_spec ] does nt allow us to rule out _ weak _ p - cygni absorption at h@xmath15 in bat99 - 5a , the absence of clear absorption in any other lines favours wn in this case , as does the essentially pure - emission h@xmath15 profile in the case of bat99 - 15a . ]",
    "lcccccccccccc + @xmath16 ( j2000 ) : & & + & & & + & & +   + @xmath16 ( j2000 ) : & & + & & & + & & & +    [ tab_one ]      the leptokurtic ( ` triangular ' ) shape of the  @xmath34686 emission in both stars suggests that their spectra are weak - lined intrinsically ( rather than reflecting substantially diluted stronger emission ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are 12 stars in the bat99 catalogue that have single - star wn3 classifications according to @xcite ; these have @xmath17 magnitudes in the range 14.67:16.98 and @xmath18 colours @xmath19:+0.31 according to the compilation by @xcite . assuming @xmath20 , @xmath21 then leads to a range in @xmath22 of 14.415.7 for this sample ( mean @xmath23  s.d . ) . with the same assumptions we find @xmath24 , 14.9 for bat99 - 5a , 15a , respectively , from the data in table  [ tab_one ] .",
    ", 14.6 , but the result for bat99 - 5a is compromised by a rather large formal error on the @xmath25-band measurement . ]",
    "the absolute magnitudes are therefore consistent with the known lmc wn3 single - star population , and with the view that the weak line strengths largely arise intrinsically , rather than through dilution .    if we nevertheless suppose that the differences in equivalent widths between 5a and 15a are due solely to modest dilution by an early - type companion in the latter case , then such a companion would have to contribute @xmath125%  of the continuum flux ; that is , it would have @xmath26 , corresponding to an early - b main - sequence star ( with @xmath27 for an isolated wr primary ) .",
    "a mix of the spectra of bat99 - 5a and hd  144470 ( b1@xmath28v ) in a continuum ratio of 3:1 does produce a reasonable match to the observed blue - region spectrum of bat99 - 15a , although the presence of absorption lines by itself does not necessarily imply an ob binary companion for bat99 - 15a .",
    "[ we observed this target at two epochs , two years apart , and the data show no evidence for variability or for radial - velocity shifts , whether in absolute terms ( @xmath29  @xmath30 ) or differentially between emission and absorption lines ( @xmath31  @xmath30 ) . ]",
    "@xcite asserted that `` there are probably no undetected wr stars in the lmc in the @xmath32 range 1719 except perhaps in obscured or crowded regions '' , and there has been little to challenge that view in the intervening time .",
    "however , subsequent serendipitous discoveries ( @xcite ; @xcite ; this paper ) hint at the possibility of significant numbers of brighter undiscovered objects , particularly among relatively weak - lined wne stars .",
    "( wc stars , with their typically stronger emission lines , are less likely to have been overlooked . )",
    "our reasonably well - defined but essentially random sample allows us to examine this issue . by merging results from photometric surveys by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we estimate that there are @xmath150,000 stars in the lmc brighter than @xmath33 .",
    "we have obtained spectra of sufficient quality to identify wr - type spectra for @xmath13500 targets , finding two new wne stars ; together , these numbers suggest that there may be as many as @xmath125 similar objects yet to be discovered . alternatively ,",
    "we have ` rediscovered ' 25 known wrs in our wider dataset , or @xmath120%  of the known population ; if we have discovered a similar proportion of an unknown population , this instead indicates perhaps @xmath19 wnes as yet undiscovered . of course , these estimates are little more than informed guesses given the small - number statistics , but none the less suggest that perhaps a dozen or so weak - lined wne stars , or @xmath120%  of the wne population , may remain to be discovered in the lmc . if this conjecture proves correct , the dominance of wne over wnl stars ( and of wn over wc types ) in this metal - poor galaxy is only strengthened",
    "we thank mike read ( roe ) for supplying objective - prism images , and sarah brough ( aao ) for correspondence on 2df fibre placements , which together effectively eliminated our initial concerns about potential misidentification of the targets reported here .",
    "paul crowther provided several very helpful comments , and rob sharp ( aao ) gave stalwart support throughout the planning , execution , and reduction of the observations ."
