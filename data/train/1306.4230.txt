    "cooperation between wireless nodes has gained wide attention as it allows trading extra spatial degree of freedom for reduced outage probability , increased capacity or lower power consumption @xcite .",
    "several works have studied the effects of node cooperation on broadcast scenarios , where a source wants to deliver a message to multiple destinations @xcite . however , until recently @xcite , explicit network geometry and associated path loss ( pl ) effects were either ignored , or considered for some special network settings .",
    "namely , in @xcite a framework facilitating outage probability analysis is proposed for cooperative multicast schemes in presence of rayleigh fading in _ dense wireless networks _ ,",
    "i.e. when the number of nodes is large . in @xcite",
    "pl between nodes has been considered in context of power efficiency of broadcast strategies again in the context of dense networks .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze the transmission delay for broadcast in networks with _",
    "finite _ number of highly mobile nodes and to compare performance of cooperative broadcast to conventional non - cooperative protocol .",
    "we also aim a realistic description of channel conditions , and use stochastic geometry to account for path loss in addition to small scale rayleigh fading .",
    "stochastic geometry tools that allow joint treatment of both channel and location randomness have been studied in - depth for infinite networks in @xcite . however",
    ", their potential has not been applied widely to cooperation , and only initial analysis of inter - node distances for finite networks was presented in @xcite .",
    "our main contribution is in the methodology that allows analysis of _ finite _ random networks , incorporating both channel and node location randomness .",
    "we show that tractable analytical results , that match closely to monte - carlo simulations , can be derived for realistic fading and path loss conditions .",
    "our results demonstrate that cooperative schemes can achieve significantly lower system delay compared to non - cooperative broadcast .",
    "we also provide simulation results to emphasize the impact of network size and node density on performance of broadcast schemes .",
    "namely , performance of the non - cooperative scheme depends primarily on network size , whereas the cooperative scheme is more sensitive to node density .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe broadcast protocols which have been studied , discuss required stochastic geometry theory and transmission latency metric .",
    "a circular cell structure is considered with the source node located in the center .",
    "the source aims to deliver a common message to all @xmath0 randomly located and highly mobile wireless nodes .",
    "we will adopt broadcast schemes previously used in @xcite as a basis for studied protocols . in _ cooperative broadcast _ the source broadcasts a message in the first time slot , and continues until at least one receiver receives it correctly .",
    "after that the source remains silent , while all successful receivers cooperate by simultaneously retransmitting the message to remaining nodes in subsequent time slots until all nodes receive the message .",
    "any receiver is assumed to process signals only from the nearest transmitter . for _ non - cooperative broadcast _ ",
    "only source transmits and all remaining nodes listen .",
    "note that non - orthogonal transmissions used in this work may lead to performance degradation due to multipath arrivals of the same message .",
    "this effect is accounted for by rayleigh fading .",
    "similar setting has been used in @xcite , where cooperatively transmitted signals were additionally coherently combined at destination .",
    "although coherent combining can improve performance , it is difficult to implement due to system overhead .",
    "therefore , only the nearest transmitter s signal is considered in this paper as its power is expected to dominate the rest .",
    "a high mobility ( hm ) model @xcite is used in this paper , where node positions change randomly and independently in each time slot . in practice , node locations may be dependent and follow certain law .",
    "such mobility models could be described by more advanced pp constructions , for example , the hard - core pp @xcite could be used to capture the effect of minimal expected node speed . a setting with static nodes",
    "was studied in @xcite , where voronoi tessellations were used to derive bounds on broadcast capacity .",
    "system performance will definitely depend on the chosen mobility model , however the impact that different mobility models have is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "point processes provide a mechanism to analyze interactions between spatially distributed objects , such as wireless nodes @xcite , which allows general yet simple results compared to conventional methods @xcite .    of particular importance",
    "is the poisson point process ( ppp ) , characterised by two fundamental properties @xcite : ( 1 ) the probability of having exactly @xmath0 nodes in a borel subset set @xmath1 of some observation window @xmath2 is poisson distributed with parameter @xmath3 ; ( 2 ) the counts of points in disjoint subsets of @xmath2 are independent . here",
    "@xmath4 is the node density and @xmath5 is lebesgue measure ( i.e. length , area or volume of @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 is a geometrical construction in space , where the point process is observed . for our purposes",
    ", @xmath6 denotes a 2-dimensional disk @xmath7 of radius @xmath8 centered at origin @xmath9 , and @xmath1 is a geometrical shape , entirely contained in @xmath2 .",
    "while ppps allow getting valuable results for asymptotic scenarios , once the number of nodes in the network is known , the ppp model becomes inappropriate since the node counts in different locations become dependent ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we further work with a binomial point process ( bpp ) , characterised by having exactly @xmath0 nodes located randomly and independently in @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bpp_plot ] ) .",
    "since hm is assumed , each time slot faces a new realization of the bpp , and we can treat the nodes that have received the message correctly and those that have not as two separate bpps .",
    "the metric of our interest is the number of transmission attempts , or time slots , @xmath10 required to deliver a broadcast message to all @xmath0 nodes within the observation window @xmath2 .",
    "the expected number of required transmissions @xmath11 can be found as @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the probability that , conditioned on having @xmath0 nodes in total , exactly @xmath14 transmissions will be sufficient to reach all nodes .",
    "we consider joint effect of small scale rayleigh fading and propagation loss due to respective node locations .",

    "a message is considered to be successfully delivered if the capacity of communication channel between the transmitting and receiving node is sufficient for transmission at required data rate @xmath26 : @xmath27 probability of such event can be described as probability of success and expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath24 are random variables and @xmath30 is the threshold for successful reception .",

    "then the broadcast process completes when @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the metric of our interest can be expressed as sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes of the @xmath14 transmission stages which lead to the completion of the process in exactly @xmath35 time slots , as can be seen from on top of this page .",

    ", receivers closer to cell boundary have larger expected distance to the nearest transmitter .",
    "the increase of the mismatch with @xmath8 can be explained by the limit of integration in : for a node shifted from the origin by distance @xmath123 , the upper outer integration limit should be adjusted to @xmath124",
    ". precise account for above factors significantly complicates analysis , whereas presented simplified model for cooperative broadcast can serve as a reasonable approximation .    from figure",
    "[ fig : number_of_retx ] we observe that cooperative broadcast achieves lower transmission delay compared to non - cooperative scenario , especially for larger - sized networks .",
    "an intuitive explanation is that in a larger network signal attenuation can be more severe for distant nodes . to emphasize the role of network properties on studied broadcast protocols a set of simulations",
    "was performed .",
    "the snr level was fixed at 5 db and the number of nodes was rounded up as @xmath125 , with @xmath126 denoting the node density .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d ] depicts the dependency of transmission delay on network size and node density for non - cooperative and cooperative schemes .",
    "it is evident that performance of the non - cooperative scheme is primarily affected by the cell size , and the node density has relatively weaker effect .",
    "in contrast , for cooperative scenario the impact of network size on system latency diminishes with the increase of node density .",
    "these results suggest that cooperative schemes can be particularly effective in geometrically large networks with moderate node density .",
    "in addition , cooperative scheme achieves significantly lower delay compared to non - cooperative scheme in the same setting .      presented analytical results are not in closed form and require multiple iterations of computations . in this subsection",
    "we estimate the order of computational complexity required to find the expected number of required transmissions @xmath11 using .",
    "note that complexities for cooperative and non - cooperative schemes differ only in calculation of the exact number of successful nodes after a transmission attempt using or .",
    "therefore , we develop the complexity order based on the non - cooperative case .    first , to obtain @xmath11 , summation of infinite number of terms is required in .",
    "however , the number of terms , contributing significantly to @xmath11 can be limited by some threshold @xmath127 .",
    "for example , the typical number of transmissions @xmath11 required to reach 10 nodes at 3 db transmit snr in rayleigh fading is roughly 16 , which is far below infinity and does not change significantly after @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we will use the following approximation : @xmath129 we will further estimate the number of operations @xmath130 required to evaluate ( 1 ) as a function of the number of nodes @xmath0 and the threshold @xmath127 .",
    "expression is a summation of all possible outcomes of @xmath131 $ ] transmissions leading to delivery of broadcasted message to all @xmath0 nodes . using methodology in @xcite",
    ", one can find that the number of such combinations is @xmath132 .",
    "each summation term in ( 5 ) consists of a product of @xmath14 probabilities , calculated using .",
    "let us denote as @xmath133 the number of operations ( i.e. additions or multiplications ) , required to evaluate .",
    "then , each term of summation in would need @xmath134 operations , and evaluation of would take @xmath135 such operations .",
    "finally , the number of operations required to evaluate can be found as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the total number of intermediate multiplications and additions involved in and .",
    "since order of complexity is determined by the highest - order term @xcite we can ignore @xmath137 and express it as @xmath138 such complexity order restricts application of this type of analysis to large values of system parameters , however for finite networks with fixed and small number of nodes , calculations can be done in realistic times .",
    "in this correspondence , we analyzed the impact of node cooperation on system delay for broadcast scenarios in finite wireless networks .",
    "developed analytical models , that incorporate both channel and node location randomness , match precisely simulated non - cooperative broadcast , and provide a close approximation for cooperative scheme .",
