    "moreover , some translates of the edges @xmath351 , [ fg ] , [ eg]$ ] meet opposite sides of @xmath360 .",
    "this is only possible if one of @xmath351 , [ fg ] , [ eg]$ ] is a translate of one of the sides of @xmath360 , and we obtain the conclusion .",

    "if @xmath432 and @xmath433 are not translates , then one of the points in @xmath445 will be in the relative interior of @xmath446 , which forces @xmath300 to be contained in @xmath61 . also , @xmath447 is a semiregular hexagon of side length @xmath58 .",
