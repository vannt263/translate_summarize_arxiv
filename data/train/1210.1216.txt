    "we study the values @xmath6 beyond the boundary @xmath11 of the absolute convergence region @xmath5 from the viewpoint of its relation to the values of the euler product .",
    "few results are known in this context .",
    "the classical results concerning the fact that the euler product converges to @xmath12 @xmath13 can be found in textbooks for either @xmath10 ( @xcite chapter 3 ) or @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only work we could find beyond this is that of goldfeld @xcite , kuo - murty @xcite and conrad @xcite .",
    "goldfeld @xcite and kuo - murty @xcite dealt with the @xmath0-functions of elliptic curves at @xmath9 , with their results supporting the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture .",
    "conrad @xcite treated more general euler products for @xmath14 .    the ( generalized ) riemann hypothesis ( grh ) for @xmath6 asserts that @xmath15 in @xmath16 . when @xmath8 , it is equivalent to the following conjecture @xcite .",
    "[ conj1 ] if @xmath8 , then for @xmath16 we have @xmath17 where the product is taken over all primes @xmath4 satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "note that the order of primes which participate in the product is important , because it is not absolutely convergent .",
    "[ conj2 ] if @xmath8 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 , we have @xmath21 where the product is taken over all primes @xmath4 satisfying @xmath18 .",
    "we call conjecture  [ conj2 ] the deep riemann hypothesis , a deeper modification of conjecture  [ conj1 ] , literally because we reach the boundary of the domain @xmath16 given in conjecture  [ conj1 ] , and logically because conjecture  [ conj2 ] implies conjecture  [ conj1 ] . indeed , if we denote @xmath22 conjecture  [ conj1 ] is equivalent to @xmath23 while conjecture  [ conj2 ] is equivalent to @xmath24 by conrad @xcite theorem 6.2",
    ".    the prototype version of this conjecture  [ conj2 ] was proposed in  @xcite . for a generalization of conjecture [ conj2 ] to the case including @xmath10 ,",
    "see akatsuka  @xcite .",
    "it is an easy task to obtain numerical support of conjecture [ conj2 ] , since the convergence of the left hand side is fairly fast .",
    "this kind of process , introducing a parameter to define a finite analogue and then taking it to infinity , is often used in physics when it is difficult to analyze the infinite system directly .",
    "one can investigate how to approach infinity by analyzing the deviation from the result in the desirable limit .",
    "for example , in order to study the asymptotic behavior in an infinite volume system , it is convenient to introduce a system of some finite size @xmath25 , and then estimate a correction by analyzing a differential equation in terms of @xmath25 , which is the so - called _ renormalization group equation_.    the situation for the riemann zeta and the dirichlet @xmath0-functions seems quite similar : the difficulty with these functions lies essentially involved in treating infinity , so that convergency of the euler product is nontrivial . in this paper",
    "we numerically examine _ the finite - size corrections _ to the zeta and @xmath0-functions appearing in the finite analog , based on the analogy between nontrivial zeros and eigenvalues of a certain infinite dimensional matrix or critical phenomena observed around a phase transition point .",
    "in this section , we prove an analog of conjecture [ conj2 ] for function fields of one variable over a finite field .",
    "the theory of zeta and @xmath0-functions over such function fields are seen , for example , in the textbook of rosen @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be the finite field of @xmath27 elements .",
    "we fix a conductor @xmath28 $ ] and introduce a `` dirichlet '' character @xmath29/(f))^\\times \\to { { \\mathbf c}}^\\times,\\ ] ] which is extended to @xmath30 $ ] by @xmath31 for @xmath32 such that @xmath33 .",
    "we define the `` dirichlet '' @xmath0-function by the euler product : @xmath34 where @xmath35 $ ] runs through monic irreducible polynomials , and @xmath36 . in the celebrated work of kornblum @xcite , it is proved that the above euler product is absolutely convergent in @xmath5 , and is a polynomial in @xmath37 of degree less than @xmath38 if @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath27 , @xmath39 and @xmath1 be as above .",
    "put @xmath40 and assume @xmath8 .",
    "then the following ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are true .    1 .   for @xmath16 , we have @xmath41 2 .   for @xmath42 with @xmath43",
    ", it holds that @xmath44     we prove ( 2 ) first .",
    "we estimate the product @xmath45 by dealing with its logarithm @xmath46 we divide the sum into three parts as @xmath47 with @xmath48    by the above mentioned kornblum s theorem , we put @xmath49 with @xmath50 or 1  @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "then by taking the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath51 and comparing the coefficients of @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 by this identity , the first partial sum @xmath54 is calculated as @xmath55 by the deligne s theorem we have @xmath56 and the assumption @xmath43 tells that @xmath57 .",
    "then by the taylor expansion for @xmath58 , it holds that @xmath59 next for estimating @xmath60 , we use the generalized mertens theorem  @xcite that @xmath61 when @xmath62 and @xmath63 , we compute that @xmath64 hence @xmath65 in all other cases it holds that @xmath66 as @xmath67 .    finally , @xmath68 as @xmath69 by a similar argument to lemma 3.1 in @xcite . for proving ( 1 ) , we use the decomposition into @xmath54 and @xmath70 , in place of that into @xmath54 , @xmath60 and @xmath71 above . in this case",
    "both @xmath60 and @xmath71 are concerning absolutely convergent series like @xmath71 in the proof of ( 2 ) .",
    "thus @xmath72 as @xmath67",
    ".    conjecture [ conj2 ] and theorem [ thm1 ] are generalized to automorphic @xmath0-functions by lownes @xcite .",
    "the following theorems are for the case of the trivial character .",
    "let @xmath73 be a projective smooth curve over @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath74    notice that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is jackson s @xmath27-integral  @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus , it is considered as a `` modified @xmath27-logarithmic integral . ''",
    "the situation is extended to the case of the riemann zeta function studied by akatsuka  @xcite , where a `` modified logarithmic integral '' appears .",
    "let @xmath77 be the genus of the curve @xmath73 .",
    "by deligne s theorem @xcite there exist @xmath78 with @xmath79 for @xmath80 such that @xmath81 note that @xmath82 , because @xmath83 .",
    "thus we have @xmath84 on the other hand we compute @xmath85 when @xmath69 , the second term tends to @xmath86 by the generalized mertens theorem  @xcite , and the third term goes to 0 , because we have @xmath87 for any @xmath88 .",
    "the first term is calculated as follows .",
    "@xmath89 where we used the fact that @xmath79 @xmath90 for convergence of the taylor expansion of the logarithms .",
    "therefore it holds that @xmath91 hence @xmath92     theorem [ thm2 ] is the `` deeper analogue '' for smooth curves of the following theorem [ thm3 ] for proper smooth schemes , which in its turn is a function field analogue of mertens theorem @xcite .",
    "in the situation of theorem [ thm2 ] , it holds that @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",
    "[ thm3 ] let @xmath73 be a proper smooth scheme over @xmath95 .",

    "we formally put @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "first we give table [ table1 ] , which shows the accuracy of conjecture [ conj2 ] at @xmath119 .",
    "we find that the ratio of @xmath120 and @xmath121 is almost equal to 1 for @xmath122 , when @xmath1 is quadratic .       to examine the analogy to critical phenomena in statistical mechanics",

    "function @xmath127 , defined as @xmath128 .",
    "right panels of figures  [ scale_mod3 ] , [ scale_mod7a ] and [ scale_mod7b ] show the values of @xmath127 . by choosing a proper exponent @xmath129 ,",
    "all the curves are almost approximated by only one curve .",
    "this means that the dependence on the cut - off parameter @xmath130 appears only in the form of the scaling variable @xmath131 .",
    "this scaling behavior supports the similarity to the critical phenomena .",
    "table  [ exponents ] shows the numerical values of the smallest zeros of the @xmath0-functions and the corresponding exponents for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "these exponents are numerically determined by fitting the curves of @xmath127 by changing the parameter @xmath135 .    in the case of the ordinary critical phenomena ,",
    "there is only one critical point .",
    "on the other hand , there are infinitely many zeros on the critical line of the @xmath0-function , which are analogs of the critical point .",
    "thus , even if we focus on only the smallest zero , as discussed in this study , there should be correction to its scaling bahavior from such other zeros : we have to take care of the scaling property for others simultaneously ."
