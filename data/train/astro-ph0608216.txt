    "@xcite determine distances of 336@xmath216 , 473@xmath233 , and 506@xmath237 pc to ori  ob1a , 1b , and 1c , respectively .    in ori  ob1 ,",
    "most of the current star formation activity is located in , or close to , the two giant molecular clouds @xcite , orion  a and b , which have been surveyed in @xmath3co by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "together with many smaller molecular clouds , the entire region is called the orion - monoceros complex @xcite .",
    "as the ori  ob1 association evolved , the ionization photons and stellar winds from massive stars and supernova ejectra produced the orion - eridanus superbubble @xcite .",
    "the orion - eridanus superbubble has been studied in many wavelengths ( reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , e.g. , in @xcite , @xmath4  100  @xmath5 @xcite , h@xmath0 @xcite , x rays @xcite , and @xmath6 rays @xcite .    even though the orion - eridanus superbubble is one of the most explored superbubbles ,",
    "the overall star formation related to the superbubble is not well investigated , simply because of its large sky coverage .",
    "it is indeed a great challenge to identify low - mass pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars in such a large region , so a wide - field survey is needed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite summarize different methods to search for low - mass ( 0.11  m@xmath7 ) pms stars in ob associations , e.g. , by objective - prisms , x rays , proper motions , and variability surveys .",
    "each method has its own advantage and drawback and here we summarize briefly each of the methods that have been applied to the orion region .",
    "an objective - prism imaging finds emission - line stars as young star candidates .",
    "a large number of candidate pms stars have been recognized by this method , e.g. , in orion @xcite by the kiso h@xmath0 survey .",
    "the total number of h@xmath0 emission stars is 1157 over an area of 150 square degrees @xcite to a limiting magnitude of v=15 .",
    "however , an h@xmath0 survey detects pms stars only with strong h@xmath0 emission , i.e. , classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) and herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars , but is not sensitive to weak - line t tauri stars ( wttss ) .",
    "an object - prism sample may also be contaminated considerably by late - type dwarfs that also show h@xmath0 in emission , namely the dme stars .",
    "indeed , @xcite conclude that only about 40% of the h@xmath0 emission stars in orion ob1a found in the kiso h@xmath0 survey are really pms stars .    because low - mass pms stars ( cttss and wttss ) are x - ray sources @xcite , the @xmath8 all sky survey ( rass ) , for example , has been used for large - scale searches for low - mass pms stars .",
    "@xmath8 is sensitive to soft x rays , so would find preferentially wttss .",
    "the main contaminations in an rass sample would be chromospherically active k and m dwarfs .",
    "@xcite study the density distribution of x - ray - selected pms candidate stars in ori ob1 ( 700 square degrees ) and find significant surface density enhancements around ori ob1a , ob1b , ob1c , and @xmath9 ori .",
    "@xcite accomplish spectroscopic and photometric observations of the rass x - ray sources in the orion cloud complex and find 112 new wttss in about 450 square degrees , and follow up by broad- and narrow - band photometric and high - resolution spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite compare the spatial distributions of the h@xmath0 emission stars in the kiso h@xmath0 survey and rass x - ray sources in oriob1 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission line sources ( cttss ) are spatially closer to the orion molecular clouds than the x - ray sources ( wttss ) , a consequence of cttss being less evolved than wttss so are still in the proximity of their birthplace .",
    "stars in an ob association share common space motions , so proper - motion measurements can be used to identify probable members in an ob association with no limitation on stellar masses . because it is difficult to measure accurately proper motions of faint stars , this method is restricted to nearby ob associations and bright ( massive and intermediate - mass ) stars @xcite .",
    "one vulnerability of this technique is that the proper motions near the solar apex or antapex are small , so it is unsuitable to study regions near these two directions , as is the case for ori  ob1 which is close to the solar antapex .",
    "pms stars are variable @xcite , so a multi - epoch photometric monitoring can be used to identify possible pms stars in an ob association .",
    "this method ensures that most pms stars be found , but may also pick up other kinds of variables which are difficult to weed out on the basis of variability alone . however , to conduct a multi - epoch survey of a large region is time - consuming . using this method ,",
    "@xcite have identified 56 low - mass young stars in the oriob1a subgroup , and 141 in oriob1b .",
    "recently , @xcite apply a similar method and find nearly 200 low - mass pms stars in the 25 ori group .",
    "@xcite use the southern 2mass telescope and perform a 0.84@xmath106 square degrees multi - epoch photometric observations near trapezium .",
    "they find 1235 near - infrared variable stars , most of which ( @xmath1193% ) are probably associated with the orion a molecular cloud .",
    "they also show that the spatial distribution of stars with near - infrared excess traces the @xmath12co emission well .",
    "none of the methods mentioned above are sensitive to those young stars embedded in clouds because of excessive extinction .",
    "recently , _ spitzer space telescope _ is used to investigate disk evolution in the @xmath13 orionis cluster , 25 orionis aggregate in ori ob1a , and ori ob1b @xcite .",
    "@xcite conduct a survey in the orion region with _",
    "spitzer _ to study star formation associated with the a and b molecular clouds .    in this work ,",
    "we use 2mass near - infrared data @xcite to select cttss and haebe stars , so as to diagnose recent star formation related to the superbubble .",
    "although near - infrared data miss sources deeply inside a cloud , most cttss and haebe stars can still be detected in the region we have investigated .",
    "we describe in  2 selection criteria of the young star sample , and follow - up spectroscopic observations . in  3 , we outline the properties of some specific star - forming regions .",
    "we discuss in  4 the structure of the superbubble , and how it influences the star formation history out to a distance of some 200  pc .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "existence of young stellar objects indicates star formation activity in a molecular cloud .",
    "the time scales ( or ages ) of protostars are short ( @xmath14  yr ) , so the chances of finding protostars in a cloud are low even if the cloud has ongoing star formation . on the other hand , the number of pms stars , with an order of longer evolutionary time scales , should be much higher .",
    "cttss in general are in an earlier evolutionary stage  hence in closer spatial association with molecular clouds  than the wtts population , which usually has an extended spatial distribution , as seen , e.g. , in taurus @xcite , chamaeleon @xcite , and lupus @xcite .",
    "it is known that different kinds of pms stars , namely wttss , cttss , and haebe stars occupy different loci in the color - color diagram @xcite . in particular ,",
    "such a diagram is a useful to tool to identify pms stars with strong infrared excesses , i.e. , haebe stars and cttss , or to distinct young stars from classical be stars @xcite , which are evolved main - sequence early - type stars whose excess radiation is attributed mainly to free - free emission , rather than to dust thermal emission . in general , pms stars associated with reflection nebulae or molecular outflows are redder than those without @xcite .",
    "for example star groups associated with perseus , orion a , orion b , and monoceros r2 molecular clouds contains young stellar objects embedded in clouds @xcite .",
    "@xcite use 2mass color - color diagram to select ctts candidates which lie between the two parallel lines , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and above the dereddened ctts locus @xcite , @xmath17 .",
    "it has been known that haebe stars show more prominent infrared excesses than cttss @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xcite extend the selection criteria to include haebe stars with colors redder than the line , @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite further improve the criteria for haebe candidates , resulting the region between the two parallel lines , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and above the line @xmath20 , to be more discriminative to exclude contaminating sources such as b[e ] and classical be stars from the young star sample .",
    "the improved set of criteria has been used to study the star formation in per  ob1 at high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : superbubble ] shows the overview of the orion - eridanus superbubble in h@xmath0 @xcite and co @xcite images .",
    "all of the pms candidate stars which were identified by 2mass colors are plotted .",
    "a total of 692 ctts and 198 haebe candidate stars have been identified in the region ( @xmath21=175 to 230 and @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is clear that the pms candidate stars are concentrated in the orion  a and b giant molecular clouds . because these pms candidate stars are grouped or clustered together , they are likely to be pms stars . on the other hand ,",
    "some molecular clouds are associated with only a few pms candidate stars .",
    "these candidates need spectroscopic observations to confirm their pms nature .",
    "we took spectroscopic observations of bright pms candidate stars in two regions , region one ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) and region two ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "region one includes the ldn1551 , ldn1558 , and ldn1563 molecular clouds ; region two includes ngc2149 , gn05.51.4 , vdb64 , and the crossbones .",
    "using the criteria described in  2.1 , there are 21 ctts and 13 haebe candidate stars in region one , and 84 ctts and 25 haebe candidates stars in region two .",
    "the criteria of @xcite were used to select pms star sample in our first observing run at kitt peak national observatory .",

    "spectra of lamp and standard stars were taken during both observing runs , and that would be used to perform wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "all the spectroscopic data were processed by the standard procedure with the noao / iraf package . after correcting the bias and flat - fielding ,",
    "the iraf package kpnoslit was used to extract and to calibrate the wavelength and flux of each spectrum .      in the two regions , we obtained spectra for a total of 43 bright pms star candidates , with 12 stars in region one and 31 in region two",
    "thirty two of these 43 candidates turn out to be bona fide pms stars , with 10 haebe and 22 t tauri stars , giving a success rate of about three quarters based on 2mass colors .    checking with simbad , we find 21 out of the 32 spectroscopically confirmed pms stars new identifications",

    "[ spectra ] , stars 111 are located in region one , and the others are in region two . notably , there are haebe stars and cttss in region two , whereas only cttss are found in region one , perhaps because of its smaller pms sample . the spatial distribution of pms stars in table  [ spectra ] is shown in figure  [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] .    originally ,",
    "star 22 is classified as a k5 star with low - dispersion spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "we later realize , with higher dispersion and signal - to - noise ratio spectra , that it should be an f6 star .",
    "we also find that intermediate - mass pms f - type stars , namely stars 22 and 37 , do not show the lithium absorption line ( 6708   ) in their spectra .",
    "using near - infrared data , we can detect cttss with strong infrared excesses , but unavoidably will miss wttss or cttss with reduced infrared excesses .",
    "although a complete census of young stellar objects is a crucial first step to study disk fraction evolution or the initial mass function , but it is not the purpose of this work . instead , our goal is to trace _ recent _ star formation activity in clouds interacting with the superbubble .",
    "therefore , even if our pms star sample may not be complete , it does not affect our results .",
    "still , we include young stellar samples found in the literatures to supplement our sample .",
    "searching young stellar objects in simbad including variable star of orion type ( or * ) , t tau - type star ( tt * ) , young stellar object ( y*o ) , and variable star of fu ori type ( fu * ) , we find 1647 objects in the same region that we search cttss and haebe stars from 2mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : simbad ] shows the distribution of the young stellar objects in simbad .",
    "most of the objects are distributed in ori ob1 , and clustered in ldn 1551 .",
    "this means that previous studies concentrate on these regions .",

    "we cross - correlate our pms star sample and young stellar objects from simbad for those young stars lised in the simbad database for positional coincidence within 5@xmath30 , and find 86 ctts and 20 haebe candidate stars in the region .",
    "hereafter , we call the haebe star and ctts candidates as haebe stars and cttss , respectively , for convenience .",
    "m42 is one of the most active nearby star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite list nearly 1600 optically detected sources within 2.5  pc of the center .",
    "@xmath31 detects 1616 x - ray sources in the orion nebula @xcite .",

    "@xcite use the @xmath32 space telescope to survey the orion  a and b molecular clouds .",
    "combined with the 2mass data , they find more than one thousand young stars , approximately half of which are grouped in clusters , e.g. , ngc  2024 and the orion nebula , whereas the other half are distributed .",
    "these authors detect 487 sources in m42 , 239 in ngc2024 , and 229 in m78 .",
    "the limitation of the study by @xcite is that they only survey the side of the orion  a molecular cloud with strong @xmath12co emission @xcite and two fields of the orion  b cloud . in comparison ,",
    "our study based on the 2mass data does not find as many young stars as by @xcite , but our spatial coverage is much more extended in these two molecular clouds . as seen in figure  [ fig : oria ] , the intensity of the @xmath3co emission of the orion  a molecular cloud is distinctively stronger on one side , like a ridge separating orion  a into two parts . in figure",
    "[ fig : oria ] , the cloud as traced by @xmath12co emission shows filamentary structure , the most prominent being the integral - shaped filament including m43 and m42 , which is thought to be the outcome of compression by the superbubble @xcite .",
    "most pms stars are associated with @xmath12co emission , in particular with more than 150 pms stars along the integral - shaped filament .",
    "the level of star - formation activity in oriona increases from ngc1977 , peaks at m43 and m42 , and then drops very quickly to the rest of the cloud .",
    "the distribution of @xmath12co emission in the orion  b molecular cloud @xcite is more conspicuous on the side facing oriob1a , where star formation is also more active ( figure  [ fig : orib ] ) .",
    "star formation around orion  b is concentrated in three locations , m78 ( including the reflection nebulae m78 and ngc2071 ) , ngc2024 , and the @xmath13  ori cluster .",
    "we find some two dozen pms stars in each of these locations .",
    "as mentioned above , recent star formation primarily took place on the side facing oriob1a in both the orion  a and b clouds .",
    "could there be nondetected ctts ( selected by near - infrared colors ) embedded on the other side of the clouds ?",
    "it is unlikely .",
    "the extinction of the regions not associated with cttss , as derived from the data in @xcite , is generally low , mostly with a@xmath33  mag , so any cttss , if they exist , could not have escaped from the detection by 2mass . in comparison ,",
    "the extinction of star - forming clouds in orion  a and b is typically a@xmath34  mag or much higher . our pms sample , naturally limited by the 2mass sensitivity ,",
    "thus should be substantially complete for cttss showing large near - infrared excess .",
    "it is therefore a secured conclusion that cttss with strong infrared excesses are distributed predominantly on the side facing ori  ob1a .",

    "the co radial velocities of ngc  2149 , gn  05.51.4 and vdb  64 @xcite are similar to that of oria , with @xmath11  1012  km s@xmath29 , so a distance of 425  pc is adopted for these clouds .",
    "we find 12 pms candidates in ngc2149 , 5 in gc0505.51.4 , and 7 in vdb64 .",
    "of there , 7 in ngc2149 , 2 in gn05.51.4 , and 4 in vdb64 are spectroscopically confirmed to be bona fide t  tauri stars ( table  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "the elongated crossbones cloud includes the reflection nebula vdb80 and the dark cloud ldn  1652 .",
    "there are 42 pms stars found in the crossbones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : superbubble ] and [ fig : two ] ) .",
    "interestingly , there young stars are not centrally concentrated as in a star cluster , but rather are distributed along the elongated cloud .",
    "stars 39 , 40 , 42 , and 43 in table  [ spectra ] and stars 20  24 in @xcite are associated with the crossbones , the majority ( 7 out of 9 ) of which exhibit forbidden line(s ) , indicative of youth @xcite . besides cttss , there is an haebe star , pds23 @xcite , in this cloud .",
    "the northern filament is a long , narrow cloud , with an estimated mass of @xmath35  m@xmath7 @xcite .",

    "multi - generational star formation in ldn1551 is suggested by @xcite , spanning the past few million years and leading to the formation of two small clusters of protostars , together with a halo of more evolved pms stars .",

    "the distribution of pms stars is similar to what is seen in the bright - rimmed clouds in oriob1 and lacob1 @xcite , implying sequential star formation in ldn  1551 .",

    ", the superbubble appears to have interacted with and prompted star formation in ldn1551 , ldn1563 , and ldn1558 as well ( figure  [ fig : one ] ) .",
    "@xcite claim that shock velocities in the range of 1545  km s@xmath29 are able to induce star formation in molecular cores .",
    "velocities faster than 45  km s@xmath29 would shred cloud cores to pieces whereas velocities slower than 15  km s@xmath29 would be unable to trigger a core to collapse .",
    "the expansion velocity of the orion - eridanus superbubble is measured to be @xmath1115  km s@xmath29 @xcite , marginally high enough to play a constructive role in induced star formation .",
    "it appears that the northern filament provides a case for a cloud neither reaching the critical density to collapse spontaneously , nor being compressed by the superbubble .",
    "given the distance ( @xmath46 ) between a cloud and ori  ob1a ( see table  [ distance ] ) , and the expansion velocity ( @xmath47)of the superbubble , the dynamical timescale ( @xmath48 ) of the superbubble can be estimated by @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is 0.6 for an energy - conserved bubble @xcite and 0.4 for a momentum - conserved bubble @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt an average value @xmath50=0.5 to derive a dynamical timescale @xmath48 to be in the range of 4.38.8  myr for the near and far edges of the superbubble .    in a triggered star - formation scenario , the age of an o star ,",
    "if it is still in existence , must be at least comparable to the ages of next - generation young stars plus the shock traveling time of a superbubble . in our case ,",
    "the superbubble was created by the massive stars in oriob1a , whose main - sequence lifetimes are some 11  myr @xcite . because a typical ctts would lose its disk in 6  myr @xcite , the cttss that we have found , all with ample nir excesses , should be no more than a few million years old .",
    "therefore , the causality holds to support a triggered star formation process in terms of the ages of ori  ob1a ( 11.4  myr ) , the transverse time of superbubble ( 4.38.8  myr ) , and typical ages of cttss ( @xmath51 myr ) .",
    "we have conducted a census of classical t tauri and herbig ae / be stars selected by 2mass colors in the vicinity of the orion - eridanus superbubble produced by ori  ob1 .",
    "our study results in young star samples in two giant molecular clouds ( orion  a and b ) and additional smaller molecular clouds , including ngc  2149 , gn  05.51.4 , vdb  64 , the crossbones , the northern filament , ldn  1551 , ldn  1558 , and ldn  1563 . combined with h@xmath0 and co images ,",
    "we investigate the star formation history in this region .",
    "the main results of our work are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "clouds associated with h@xmath0 filaments are preferentially located on the border of the orion - eridanus superbubble , created by uv photons from luminous stars in ori  ob1 .",
    "clouds outlined by h@xmath0 filaments exhibit recent star formation .",
    "the northern filament neither accompanies h@xmath0 filament , nor is associated with pms stars .",
    "it is likely to be situated outside , hence out of reach of the compression by , the superbubble to form stars .",
    "star formation triggered by the expanding orion - eridanus superbubble started from ori  ob1a and propagated to other subgroups .",
    "the superbubble not only triggered starbirth in orion  a and b , but also led to current star formation in ngc  2149 , gn  05.51.4 , vdb  64 , and the crossbones which are located some one hundred pc away from ori  ob1a .",
    "4 .   the superbubble likely also prompted star formation in clouds some two hundred pc away from ori  ob1a , as witnessed in ldn1551 , ldn1563 , and ldn1558 .",
    "the triggered star formation scenario is supported by sequential star formation , ages of pms stars in the clouds , and the expansion timescale of the superbubble .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for detailed reading , constructive comments , and suggestions .",
    "we want to thank specially richard f. green who kindly provided us kpno director s discretionary time for this study .",
    "our gratitude goes to john bally for providing @xmath12co maps of ori  a and ori  b and to you - hua chu for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> a census of classical t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars has been performed around the orion - eridanus superbubble which is ionized and created by the ori  ob1 association . </S>",
    "<S> this sample is used to study the spatial distribution of newborn stars , hence the recent star formation sequence , in the region that includes two giant molecular clouds ( orion  a and b ) and additional smaller clouds ( ngc  2149 , gn  05.51.4 , vdb  64 , the crossbones , the northern filament , ldn1551 , ldn1558 , and ldn1563 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the molecular clouds are located on the border of the superbubble , and associated with h@xmath0 filaments and star formation activity , except the northern filament which is probably located outside the superbubble . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that while star formation progresses from the oldest oriob1a subgroup to 1b , 1c and 1d , the superbubble compresses and initiates starbirth in clouds such as ngc2149 , gn05.51.4 , vdb64 , and the crossbones , which are located more than one hundred pc away from the center of the superbubble , and even in clouds some two hundred pc away , i.e. , in ldn1551 , ldn1558 , and ldn1563 . </S>",
    "<S> a superbubble appears to have potentially a long - range influence in triggering next - generation star formation in an ob association . </S>"
