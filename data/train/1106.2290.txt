    "this paper looks at a possible axiomatic foundation for the use of bijections in the new methodology introduced by yaroslav sergeyev in his seminal papers , see  @xcite which we will refer to as the * new numeral system*. this system contains the standard numeral system to write finite integers , positive and negatives .",
    "it also contains a symbol , , which is , by definition the number of elements of the set of natural numbers with this property that for any finite positive integer  @xmath0 .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for more details and motivations on the system .    in section  [ onbij ] , we look again at the notion of bijection in the traditional setting and , on an example , how it works in the new setting of the new numeral system .    in section  [ yetbij ] ,",
    "we present a proposal toward a formalization within the frame of the new numeral system .",
    "as we shall several times refer to the postulates of the new numeral system , we reproduce them here for the convenience of the reader , exactly as they are stated in  @xcite",
    ".    we postulate the existence of infinite and infinitesimal objects but accept that human beings and machines are able to execute only a finite number of operations .",
    "we shall not tell * what are * the mathematical objects we deal with ; we shall just construct more powerful tools that will allow us to improve our capacities to observe and to describe properties of mathematical objects .",
    "we adopt the principle ` the part is less than the whole ' to all numbers ( finite , infinite and infinitesimal ) and to all processes ( finite and infinite ) .",
    "remember that cantor s set theory is based on the famous bernstein theorem which states the following assertion :    @xmath1 ( bernstein)[bernstein ] let @xmath2 and  @xmath3 be sets such that there is an injective mapping  @xmath4 from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 and an injective mapping  @xmath5 from  @xmath3 into  @xmath2 .",
    "then , there is a bijection  @xmath6 from  @xmath2 onto  @xmath3 .",
    "traditionally , sets @xmath2 and  @xmath3 such that there is a bijection from  @xmath2 onto  @xmath3 are called * equipotent * , we also usually say that they have the * same number * of elements . this relation between  @xmath2 and  @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "if there is an * injection * from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 , then it is said that @xmath2 has no more elements than  @xmath3 and this is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "bernstein s theorem says that this latter relation defines an order among the sets .",
    "now , if we look at many examples of mathematical objects with the new tool given by the new numeral system , it seems that there is a blatant contradiction between the just mentioned theorem and postulate  3 of the new numeral system , see  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in traditional mathematics , to have a part as big as the whole is the characteristics of the infinite sets . with postulate  3",
    ", this is no more true and a proper part of an infinite set is always less than the whole .",
    "however , in his seminal papers , yaroslav sergeyev always stresses that his new theory does not contradict cantor s theory , that it simply gives new tools to better study infinite objects than those provided by traditional set theory .",
    "we shall look at the following example which was the subject of a lightening discussion with yaroslav sergeyev .",
    "the example is taken from geometry .",
    "here it is , as i presented it to yaroslav .",
    "let @xmath2 be a half - plane .",
    "let @xmath9 be the line which is the border of  @xmath2 , see the left - hand side picture of figure  [ planes ] .",
    "let @xmath10  be the reflection of  @xmath2 in  @xmath9 , next picture of figure  [ planes ] .",
    "let @xmath11  be another line of the plane , parallel to  @xmath9 and inside  @xmath2 with @xmath12 , third picture of figure  [ planes ] .",
    "let  @xmath3 be the reflection of  @xmath10 into  @xmath11 , see the rightmost picture of figure  [ planes ] . clearly , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . according to cantor s theory , @xmath2 and  @xmath3 have the same number of elements .",
    "according to sergeyev s system , as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath3  has less elements than  @xmath2 .",
    "yaroslav told me that something is not in agreement with his new approach starting from the very presentation of the objects we consider .",
    "what is a half - plane ?",
    "what is a half - line as , in this example , the really objects at work are half - lines .",
    "traditionally , we would write a half - line as @xmath15-\\infty , a]$ ] or @xmath16 where @xmath17  is some real number .",
    "yaroslav pointed that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not precise notions . compared with natural numbers , they are in the same position as _ many _ is with the natural numbers of pirah@xmath20 s , @xmath21 and _ many_. ] , which are exactly 1 and  2 ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "and so , yaroslav continued , we have to precise the bounds of the infinite interval of which consists our half - line : @xmath22 $ ] where @xmath17 and  @xmath23 are numbers , finite or infinite .",
    "and then , he continued , let us make the computations associated with the considered reflections .",
    "here , i provide this computation , in order the reader could appreciate what is found out .",
    "let @xmath24\\times i$ ] , where @xmath23 is a positive infinite number , @xmath17  is the abscissa of the point where @xmath9 cuts the @xmath25-axis and @xmath26 $ ] is an infinite interval with @xmath27  a positive infinite number .",
    "as our reflections are performed in axes which are perpendicular to the @xmath25-axis , we perform the computations on abscissas only .",
    "the reflection in the line @xmath9 transforms @xmath25  into @xmath1@xmath25+@xmath28 .",
    "and so , we get that @xmath29+@xmath30\\times i$ ] .",
    "let @xmath31  be the abscissa of the points where the line  @xmath11 cuts the @xmath25-axis .",
    "similarly , the reflection in  @xmath11 transforms @xmath25  into @xmath1@xmath25+@xmath32 , so that @xmath33@xmath1@xmath23@xmath1@xmath28+@xmath34\\times i$ ] .",
    "now , it is plain that @xmath1@xmath35 as we assume @xmath36 and that @xmath1@xmath23@xmath1@xmath28+@xmath37@xmath23 , for the same reason . and this shows us that @xmath38 , contrary to what was concluded from the example , see figure  [ newplanes ] .",
    "note that the same computations performed in the frame of cantor s theory shows that from @xmath39-\\infty , a]\\times l$ ] with @xmath40-\\infty,+\\infty[$ ] , we get @xmath41 and @xmath42-\\infty,$]@xmath1@xmath17+@xmath43\\times l$ ] . accordingly , as cantor s theory does not allow us to distinguish between infinite quantities .",
    "we can not see that the left - hand side bound of  @xmath3 is smaller than the left - hand side bound of  @xmath2 and so , there are infinitely many points of  @xmath3 which are not contained in  @xmath2 .    from this example",
    ", we can draw the conclusion : we have to make it as exact as we can the description of the objects on which we are working . in our example",
    "this concerns the sets we considered and the operations which we performed on these sets and , as far as numbers are involved , in which numeral system the numbers are expressed .",
    "more precisely , we had to indicate the exact bounds of our half - planes , it should be better to call them semi - infinite strips , _ i.e. portions of the plane _ in between by two parallel lines .",
    "we also had to write down the transformations , here reflections in line , explicitly .",
    "it is important to notice that the new numeral system is not a sub - system of non standard analysis and that it is neither a sub - system of the theory of ordinals .",
    "these points will be made more clear a bit further .",
    "first , we look at the definition of the number of elements of a set and then , how to deal with this notion in connection with bijections .      the simplest way to define the number of elements of a set  @xmath44 is to count the number of its elements . note that , practically , we can actually count finite sets only , moreover , with a rather small number of elements .",
    "this is contained in postulate  1 of the new numeral system , see  @xcite .",
    "now , if we wish to perform abstract considerations , we have to bypass this possibility and this is why we use descriptions .",
    "as long as we can describe an object , we may consider that we handle it , if needed .",
    "of course , what we can do for descriptions strongly depends on the language we use to formulate them , this is the content of postulate 2 , see  @xcite .",
    "we have here to introduce a few notations which will be used in the statements and the proofs which we provide later .",
    "in particular , if @xmath45 is a number of the numeral system , we denote by the set of integers  @xmath46 which satisfy the relations and .",
    "here and later , @xmath46 or @xmath45 are any symbol used to define a number is assumed to design the representation of this number in the numeral system .",
    "we start by defining how we can define the number of elements of a set .",
    "[ enum ] let @xmath47 be numeral system and let @xmath44 be a nonempty set .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is a * measurement * of  @xmath44 in  @xmath47 if there is a numeral in  @xmath47 expressing a positive integer @xmath45 , finite or infinite , with the property that @xmath4 is a bijection of @xmath48 $ ] onto  @xmath44 .",
    "we say that a set  @xmath44 is * measured * in  @xmath47 if there is a measurement of  @xmath4 .",
    "when this is the case , we say that @xmath44 is * measured * by @xmath48 $ ] and , for short , that it is measured by  @xmath45 .",
    "we also say that @xmath45  is the number of elements of  @xmath44 .",
    "we shall also denote by @xmath49 the number of elements of  @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is required to be an integer only , that it may be finite or infinite and , in the latter case , that it is not restricted to be bounded by  . also note that when we say that @xmath44 is measured , we have to be able to provide an @xmath4  which measures  @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , this @xmath4  must be described , not merely assumed to exist .",
    "we use the words _ measure _ , _ measured _ and _ measurement _ because we have in mind the possibility to count the number of elements beyond if needed . as already mentioned about @xmath45 , it must be possible to write it in some numeral system .",
    "this means that a measurement can be performed only if we have at our disposal a numeral system allowing us to express the number  @xmath45 used in definition  [ enum ] .    in definition  [ enum ]",
    ", we insist in the fact when a set is measured , the measurement refers to a numeral system  @xmath47 which has to be made explicit . as an example , the set is measured in the pirah@xmath50s system as it is measured in the standard numeral system as well as in the new one and , in all these cases , by the identity function .",
    "however , the set can not be measured in the pirah@xmath50s system where number  3 can not be expressed .",
    "of course , is measured in the standard numeral system as well as in the new one , again with the help of the identity function .",
    "this relativity is very important , it is contained in postulate  2 : if we have a more precise language we can see more properties .",
    "next , we consider how to define the number of elements of a subset of a set . starting from this point , in order to make statements easier to read , we shall not repeat the reference to a numeral system .",
    "however , as indicated above , we have to consider that the word _ measurement _",
    "always refer to such a system , as it must be possible to express the number used to establish the measurement in the numeral system for which the definitions or the theorems are applied .",
    "[ measured ] let @xmath2  be a subset of the set  @xmath44 .",
    "we say that @xmath2  is * co - measured * in  @xmath44 if there are measurements @xmath4 and  @xmath5 such that @xmath4  measures  @xmath2 and  @xmath5 measures @xmath51 .",
    "[ num ] if @xmath2 is a co - measured subset of  @xmath44 , then @xmath44  is measured .",
    "we have that @xmath52 .    proof .",
    "let @xmath4 be a measurement of  @xmath2 and let  @xmath5 be a measurement of @xmath51 .",
    "there are positive integers  @xmath45 and  @xmath53 such that @xmath4  is a bijection from @xmath48 $ ] onto  @xmath2 and @xmath5  is a bijection from  @xmath54 $ ] onto  @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , we define @xmath11 from @xmath55+@xmath56 $ ] as follows :    110=    we can also extend the definition of the number of elements of a set in the following conditions .",
    "[ bijenum ] let @xmath2  be a measured set .",
    "then @xmath3 has the same number of elements as  @xmath2 if and only if there is a bijection from  @xmath2 onto  @xmath3 .",
    "assume that there is a bijection  @xmath4 from  @xmath2 onto  @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath11  be a measurement of  @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath57 is a measurement of  @xmath3 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath4  be a measurement from @xmath48 $ ] onto  @xmath2 and @xmath5  be an measurement of  @xmath58 $ ] onto  @xmath3 . then , as @xmath59",
    ", @xmath60 is a bijection from  @xmath2 onto  @xmath3 .",
    "now , we can order the measured sets by their number of elements .",
    "[ inject ] let @xmath2 and @xmath3  be two measured sets .",
    "we have that @xmath61 if and only if there is an injection from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3",
    ".    proof .",

    "assume that there is an injection  @xmath11 from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 .",
    "assume that @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath57 is a measurement from  @xmath58 $ ] onto a proper subset @xmath10 of  @xmath3 .",
    "now , by the previous theorem , @xmath64 . this is a contradiction with postulate  3 .",
    "consequently , as the order on integers is linear , @xmath62 .    [ bernsteinn ] let @xmath2 and  @xmath3 be two measured sets .",
    "then if there is an injection from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 and if there is an injection from  @xmath3 into  @xmath2 , then @xmath65 .    proof . if the injection from  @xmath2 into  @xmath3 would not be surjective , we would obtain a proper subset of  @xmath3 with as many elements as  @xmath3 , a contradiction with postulate  3 .    and",
    "so , we can see that bernstein s theorem is true for measured sets .",
    "we have the following property which has no counter - part in the traditional theory :    [ inter ] let @xmath2 and  @xmath3 be two measured sets with @xmath65 .",
    "then , if and , then and are nonempty sets . moreover , if @xmath66 is co - measured in  @xmath2 and in  @xmath3 , then both and are measured , and .    proof .",
    "let @xmath2 and  @xmath3 be sets satisfying the assumptions of the first sentence of the theorem .",
    "let @xmath4  be a measurement from @xmath48 $ ] onto  @xmath2 and @xmath5  be a measurement from @xmath48 $ ] onto  @xmath3 , as . if and @xmath67 , as we can not have @xmath68 thanks to and to postulate  3 , we have necessarily that .",
    "similarly , from @xmath67 we can not have @xmath13 and so , .",
    "now , if @xmath66 is co - measured in both @xmath2 and  @xmath3 we have three measurements @xmath69 , @xmath11 and @xmath70 from @xmath55@xmath1@xmath56 $ ] onto , from @xmath54 $ ] onto @xmath66 and from @xmath55@xmath1@xmath56 $ ] onto respectively .",
    "the last assertion of the theorem follows from theorem  [ inject ] .      starting from this subsection and for the restof the paper",
    ", we work in the new numeral system defined by yaroslav sergeyev , see  @xcite",
    ". it should be appropriate to extend the frame of definition  [ enum ] to the definition of elements suggested in  @xcite , subsection  5.4 .",
    "let us illustrate this by the example of @xmath71 .",
    "this number is defined as the number of elements of the set . in  @xcite ,",
    "subsection  5.4 , this is generalized from the function to any strictly increasing function  @xmath5 . when we consider a positive finite number  @xmath0 , we know that @xmath0 is the number of elements of the set @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "this definition is extended to any number , including and beyond .",
    "now , consider an initial segment  @xmath73 of @xmath74 $ ] , where @xmath75 is some infinite positive integer .",
    "this means @xmath76 and that when @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 . if @xmath80 $ ] , there is some number  @xmath45 such that @xmath81 .",
    "note that if there is a number  @xmath82 which is the number of elements of  @xmath73 , then @xmath83 $ ] , by definition of the measurement , here by the identity function .",
    "now , if @xmath84 , then @xmath85@xmath1@xmath86 $ ] which means that @xmath73  has at most @xmath82@xmath11 elements , a contradiction .",
    "and so we have that @xmath87 $ ] . consequently , if we consider that the number of elements of an initial segment of @xmath74 $ ] is defined , then any initial segment of @xmath74 $ ] is of the form @xmath88 $ ] for some number  @xmath89 .",
    "but this is an assumption so that we have to formulate it as an axiom :    [ segment ] let @xmath75  be a positive integer finite or infinite , possibly greater than . for each initial segment  @xmath73 of @xmath74 $ ]",
    ", there is a number  @xmath89 such that @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath82 is the * number of elements * of  @xmath73 .",
    "there is here a difference between the classical theory of sets .",
    "consider the set @xmath90 of positive integers  @xmath46 which are less than  @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , @xmath90 is an initial segment when @xmath91 . in the traditional theory , @xmath92 . using the new numeral system",
    ", we get that @xmath93@xmath1@xmath86 $ ] .",
    "now , we can see that the way we defined @xmath71 is legitimated by axiom  [ segment ] .",
    "we may also define @xmath94 and many other numbers can be defined in this way as and @xmath95 for any positive finite number  @xmath96 .",
    "however , note that , according to postulate  1 , the number of applications of axiom  [ segment ] is finite so that in fact , we enlarge the numeral system by introducing such notations , only finitely many times and in a finite way .",
    "it is important to repeat that axiom  [ segment ] applies to sets which are measured and so it must be possible to express the number  @xmath82 in the same numeral system  @xmath47 as the one used to express the number  @xmath75 .",
    "this means that axiom  [ segment ] does not apply to any set .",
    "in particular , we can not apply the axiom to the set of finite positive integers .",
    "the main reason is that this set is not well described , even in the new numeral system introduced by yaroslav sergeyev .",
    "according to postulate  2 , we can not say what are the finite positive integers , so that we can not speak about their set with precision . however , we can speak of the set  @xmath97 of the expressions in  @xmath47 of the finite positive integers .",
    "this set is clearly an initial segment of so that there is a finite positive integer @xmath98 expressible in  @xmath47 such that and such that is not expressible in  @xmath47 .",
    "note that this shows us that the peano axiom works on another plan : it says that if @xmath0  is a positive integer , so is  .",
    "but in stating such a property , this axiom does not consider as relevent the possibility to express both  @xmath0 and .",
    "to say things in other words , peano axiom does not take into account practical limitations in expressing numbers concretely",
    ". now , postulates  1 and  2 tell us that we always use a language to describe objects and that the quality of the description depends on the expressive power of the language .",
    "in particular , we have to take into account the limitations on writing the expression of a positive integer .",
    "in any numeral system  @xmath47 , there is a maximal integer @xmath98 which can be expressed in  @xmath47 .",
    "this limitation is not that surprising : in most practical programming languages , there is a constant maxint which denotes the greatest positive integer .",
    "the operation can not be performed and if your program performs such an operation , polite compilers inform you that there was an attempt to use a non admissible value for the indicated type . accordingly , the application of axiom  [ segment ] to the expressions of finite positive numbers is very natural .",
    "this stresses the usefulness of axiom  [ segment ] .",
    "note that axiom  [ segment ] is in full agreement with postulate  3 saying that _ the part is less than the whole _ is always true , whatever the sets , while this principle does not hold for cantor s infinite cardinals .",
    "also note that in the traditional ordinal theory , @xmath99 and @xmath99 + 1 exist but @xmath99@xmath11 can not be defined as @xmath99 is a limit - ordinal .",
    "the existence of @xmath98 and the discussion about maxint give us the possibility to distinguish the new system from non standard analysis .",
    "indeed , in non standard analysis , there can not be a maximal positive finite integer simply because peano axioms are there valid .",
    "accordingly , if @xmath0  is a finite integer , @xmath0 + 1 always exists in non standard analysis , even if nobody can write it , so that there can not be a maximal finite integer .",
    "moreover , if @xmath75  is an infinite integer , it is possible , in non standard analysis , to construct a bijection  @xmath100 from onto .",
    "we define  @xmath100 by if @xmath25 is a finite positive number and by if @xmath25  is an infinite number .",
    "now , in the new system , this is impossible as is strictly contained into , due to postulate  3 .",
    "we shall go back to this discussion a bit later .    as a corollary of axiom  [ segment ] we can state the following property :    [ upperbound ]",
    "let @xmath75 be a positive integer , finite or infinite , and let @xmath5 be a strictly increasing function over @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath45 be the number of elements of the set .",
    "we know that . the number @xmath45 is also characterized as the single number  @xmath25 such that .    proof . as @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "if we do not have @xmath103+@xmath104 , then we have so that @xmath45+@xmath105 and , as @xmath5  is strictly increasing , @xmath106 is a segment and it contains , a contradiction with the definition of  @xmath45 . and",
    "so , @xmath107 + 1 . the uniqueness of @xmath45 follows from the fact that @xmath5 is strictly increasing .",
    "note that @xmath108+@xmath109 may be infinite : when @xmath110 , we have that @xmath108+@xmath111 and if @xmath45 is defined by the characterization of theorem  [ upperbound ] with @xmath112 , @xmath45  is clearly infinite .",
    "let us remark that axiom  [ segment ] and theorem  [ upperbound ] allow us to define a lot of numbers : this is a general paradigm related to the notion of definability .",
    "however , concretely , we may apply them to finitely many instances of concrete formulas only so that these new tools remain in agreement with postulate  1 of sergeyev s new system .",
    "now , axiom  [ segment ] allows us to define an important notion : that of the smallest element of a set . namely ,    [ min ] let @xmath75  be a positive integer , finite or infinite and let @xmath2 be a nonempty set of @xmath74 $ ] .",

    "now , , otherwise , @xmath145+@xmath104 could be defined , and then @xmath45+@xmath76 , a contradiction with the definition of  @xmath45 .",
    "now , @xmath4  is injective by construction and , by the construction of  @xmath4 , as , @xmath4  is surjective onto  @xmath2 . and so , @xmath4 is a measurement of  @xmath2 .",
    "it is important here to remind the reader that theorem  [ allmeasured ] deals with sets which are clearly described only .",
    "this is why the theorem says `` let @xmath2  be a non empty set of ... '' and not `` for any non empty set of ... '' .",
    "we have to also remark that in most cases of a concrete set , the measurement is given with the description of the set .",
    "also , we remind the reader that the number used to measure a set has to be expressed in an explicit numeral system . according to postulate  1",
    ", we can only perform finitely many operations on finitely many objects . accordingly , each time we apply theorem  [ compl ] , its corollary and theorem  [ allmeasured ] , we can give appropriate expressions : we use only finitely many symbols .    as an example of a set for which we can not immediately number its elements",
    ", we can indicate the set of * prime * integers , were a positive number greater than  1 , finite or infinite is prime whether it has two divisors exactly : 1 and itself .",
    "this set is clearly infinite but , at the present moment , we can not say that it is measured and , also , we can not prove that it can not be measured .",
    "now , let us consider an infinite positive integer  @xmath75 , and let us consider the transformation @xmath146 + 1@xmath1@xmath25 .",
    "it maps @xmath74 $ ] onto itself and it is clearly a bijection as it is involutive .",
    "now , it is easy to see that if @xmath147 $ ] , then @xmath148 if and only if @xmath149 .",
    "this allows us to state the following property :    [ lemax ] let @xmath75  be an infinite positive integer and let @xmath2  be a non empty subset of  .",
    "then @xmath2  contains an element  @xmath25 such that for any @xmath150 , @xmath143 .",
    "we say that @xmath25  is the greatest element of  @xmath2 and it is denoted by  @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath151 be the image of  @xmath2 under  @xmath152 .",
    "then , as @xmath152  maps @xmath74 $ ] onto itself , by theorem  [ min ] , @xmath151  has a smallest element  @xmath153 .",
    "let @xmath154 . for @xmath150 , we get @xmath155 and so , @xmath156 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath25  is the greatest element of  @xmath2 .",
    "now , we can define the notion of final segment :    [ final ] let @xmath75  be an infinite positive integer .",
    "say that a nonempty subset @xmath157 of @xmath74 $ ] is a * final segment * if @xmath158 and , for any @xmath25 in  @xmath157 and any  @xmath159 $ ] , from @xmath160 , it follows that @xmath161 .",
    "now , it is clear from this definition that @xmath2  is a final segment of @xmath74 $ ] if and only if @xmath162 is an initial segment of @xmath74 $ ] .",

    "let @xmath2  be a non empty subset of @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath2  has a convex hull which is @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "we would like to discuss a few points about the results of this paper .",
    "first of all , remember that in subsection  [ define ] , we have considered @xmath75 as an infinite positive integer .",
    "we have mentioned after definition  [ enum ] that we may consider infinite integer which are greater than  . in yaroslav",
    "sergeyev s works , it was several times indicated that there are sets whose number of elements are greater than  . let us give the following examples given in  @xcite .",
    "the set of integers , @xmath170 , has @xmath171 + 1 elements .",
    "the set has @xmath172 elements and the set of numeral expressions of the form @xmath173 with has @xmath174 elements . now ,",
    "as pointed at in  @xcite , the word _ sequence _ is restricted to subsets of @xmath175 $ ] as well as the words _ enumerate _ and _ enumeration_. this is why in section  [ yetbij ] we used the words _ measure _ , _ measured _ and _ measurement_. now , we did not use the term _ measurable _ which is used in mathematics in a completely different environment .",
    "the words _ measure _ , _ measured _ and _ measurement _ refer to one of the historically first physical process .",
    "the idea is to stress on the concreteness of the notion : it evokes comparison with a yardstick to measure the length of objects .",
    "here we have the same idea of comparison with a yardstick : the set of numbers up to a given one .",
    "now , there is another reason why the word _ measured _",
    "is used instead of _",
    "measurable_. when we say that a word is _ measured _ we have always to have in mind how it has been measured , _",
    "i.e. _ we have to know at least one way to do that , and so , we have to know at least one _ measurement _ of the initial segment of  @xmath74 $ ] which can be put in bijection with the set , as well as to be able to write @xmath75 in the numerical system we use and the measurement explicitly describes the bijection .",
    "second , it is again a point which we have already stressed : when we speak of a set and of an application on the set , we know a description of the set and a description of the application .",
    "as already mentioned , the description depends on our language .",
    "we have already indicated how the introduction of   allows us to distinguish much more clearly between infinite sets than with the traditional cantor theory which can not see any difference in the number of elements between for instance @xmath176 and the set of pairs of positive natural numbers .",
    "now , this remark is very important .",
    "we have mentioned that pirah@xmath20s have only three numbers 1 , 2 and _ many _ and that the computation rules involving _ many _ and 1 or  2 are very similar to cantor s rules involving @xmath177 and finite natural number .",
    "what we have to stress here is that this difference is very important .",
    "the new tools allow to see better , but the previous tools can not see what is seen by the new ones . as an example , see  @xcite , pirah@xmath20s can not define the set @xmath178 .",
    "they can define the first two elements but the three others have no meaning for them .",
    "and so , many problems about infinite sets which are formulated in the frame of cantor s theory have a new formulation in the new numeral system and for some of them , the problem simply vanishes . in particular",
    ", we refer the reader to  @xcite for important results in this regard .",
    "it is now possible to make a bit more precise our discussion about the difference between non standard analysis and the new system .",
    "we proved that for any infinite positive number @xmath179 , in non standard analysis , there is a bijection of onto .",
    "the bijection  @xmath100 which was constructed for that purpose can not be defined on if we consider an infinite positive numeral  @xmath75 of the new system .",
    "indeed , the representations of the finite positive numbers which can be written in the numeral system  @xmath47 have a maximal number @xmath75 .",
    "now , @xmath100  can not be a measurement of as @xmath75 + 1 can not be written . in the same way ,",
    "the set of infinite numbers which can be written in  @xmath47 is clearly a final segment and so , it has a smallest element @xmath180 .",
    "now , can not be written , so that the interval contains exactly two elements in the system @xmath47 while in non standard analysis , if we fix @xmath181  as an infinite positive integer , contains infinitely many integers for any finite positive number  @xmath179 and any infinite one  @xmath182 with @xmath183 .",
    "let  @xmath6 be the function which maps  @xmath25 onto for any finite positive integer  @xmath25 in .",
    "then @xmath6  is an injection from into .",
    "moreover , if we assume that is a finite number , then defining @xmath6 on any infinite positive integer  @xmath184 from by , we obtain that @xmath6  is a bijection from onto .",
    "it seems to me that this paper stresses in a right way the importance of being precise when looking at the number of elements of sets , especially when we wish to compare them in this regard .",
    "we have to look at well defined sets and , when comparing them , we also have to look at the tools on which the comparison relies .",
    "it seems to me that with the material given in this paper , we have more tools to compute the number of elements of a set in the new numeral system devised by yaroslav sergeyev .",
    "i hope that this might contribute to new developments of this beautiful system .",
    "i am extremely in debt to yaroslav sergeyev for his attention to this work and for very fruitful discussions , especially about the notion of relativity of our theories , see  @xcite . as yaroslav always repeats , we should be fully aware when using mathematics that mathematics is also a living thing which evolves with the life of mankind .                    ya .",
