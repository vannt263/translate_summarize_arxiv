    "over last years a possibility to look for new hypothetic particles which results in a new short range yukawa - type potential of fermion - fermion interaction is actively discussed .",
    "the spin - dependent short - range interactions may be induced by light , pseudoscalar bosons such as the axion invented to solve the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "this interaction is usually parameterised as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are nondimensional parameters of the scalar and pseudo - scalar coupling constants between the neutron and exchanged boson .",
    "@xmath5 is typical parameter of the range of forces ( compton wavelength of axion ) .",
    "there are proposals to search this new type of interaction using gravitationally bound quantum states of a free neutron @xcite and using a spin precession of the trapped ultracold neutrons in vicinity of bulk matter @xcite .",
    "both of these methods have a suitable sensitivity for the range of @xmath6 cm , but their sensitivity is extremely decreased for the range @xmath7 cm .    here",
    "we consider a possibility to use a neutron diffraction in the perfect non - centrosymmetric crystal to search a new type of short range interaction for the @xmath8 cm .",
    "neutron diffraction in a non - centrosymmetric crystal was widely discussed within the framework of the project to search for the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) by the diffraction method @xcite .    any crystal potential ( nuclear , electric , new short range potential , .. ) can be presented as sum of the potentials of different atoms placed into the crystal cell . for the periodic crystal structure it is convenient to present such potential as fourier series over the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the potential of single atom , @xmath12 is the atom position , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the interplanar distance . here",
    "we take into account @xmath16 , because we consider the real value potentials .",
    "g - harmonics of potentials can be found from the equation @xmath17    in the case of nuclear potential @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the neutron mass , @xmath20 is volume of crystal unit cell , @xmath21 is the structure amplitude @xmath22 here we sum over the atoms of unit cell , @xmath23 is the scattering amplitude of @xmath24 atom , @xmath25 is the debye - waller temperature factor .    for the case of a non - centrosymmetric crystal",
    "the different potentials can be shifted to each others , by the other words , the phases @xmath26 of different crystal potentials can be not equal . for the case of electric potential this shift results in a large electric field affected the neutron in non - centrosymmetric crystal @xcite .",
    "we take the phase of the nuclear potential equal to zero so the value of the electric field affected the neutron will be @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are amplitude and phase of the g - harmonics of crystal electric potential accordingly .",
    "let s consider the monopole - dipole interaction ( [ eq : v_sp ] ) . direct calculation of g - harmonic of @xmath30 from ( [ eq:(3 ) ] ) gives    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitude and phase of structure factor @xmath35 of the crystallographic plane .",
    "@xmath35 is determined by the following sum @xmath36 here @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the mass and position of a corresponding atom in elementary cell .",
    "neutron wave function is determined by the nuclear interaction , and for the case of close to bragg direction passage through the crystal can be written as @xcite    @xmath39 , \\label{eq:23}\\ ] ]    where we take into account that the phase of nuclear harmonics @xmath40 equal to zero , @xmath41=@xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the parameter of deviation from the exact bragg condition .    therefore , @xmath47 potential affecting the neutron in the crystal will be @xmath48    @xmath49    we should note that for centrosymmetric crystal @xmath50 and in this case the mean potential affecting the neutron will be zero .",
    "one can see also from ( [ eq : v_sp ] ) that this `` pseudomagnetic '' potential is proportional to the parameter @xmath51 determined by the deviation from the bragg condition .",
    "that allows to control the value and sign of the potential selecting the neutrons with slightly different energies from the bragg one .",
    "interaction with such a potential will lead to the neutron spin rotation around the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath52 by the angle    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the time of neutron travel through the crystal .",
    "for example let s consider ( 110 ) plane of non - centrosymmetric quartz crystal and @xmath55 . for ( 110 )",
    "plane @xmath56@xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60@xmath61 .",
    "the angle of spin rotation due to considered potential will be @xmath62 \\cdot \\frac{g_s g_p } { g^2",
    "+ 1/\\lambda^2 } l % v_{sp}=1.5\\cdot 10^{-3 } g_s g_p ( { \\bf n}_g\\cdot \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$ } ) [ ev]\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the crystal length . for the cold neutron beam at high flux reactor",
    "the measurement accuracy @xmath64 can be reached for 100 day of the statistic accumulation @xcite .",
    "that allows to give the constraint for monopole - dipole interaction @xmath65\\cdot ( { g^2 + 1/\\lambda^2})\\ ] ] for the l=50 cm .",
    "recently the test experiment for the search for neutron edm by crystal - diffraction method was carried out @xcite .",
    "this result already allows to give the direct constraint on a value of @xmath0 better than any other method for the @xmath1 cm , see fig.[fig : sensitivity ] , curve ( 1 ) .",
    "the comparison of different constraints on @xmath66 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] .    one should note that both neutron edm interaction with crystal electric field and the spin - dependent short - range interaction lead to a neutron spin rotation about reciprocal lattice vector @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the considered shot - range interaction can give a false effect for the neutron edm experiment and vice versa .",
    "however , these two interactions will be different for different crystallographic planes , so in the case of nonzero effect they can be separated using different planes for measurement .    .",
    "curve ( 1 ) is the constraint from the crystal - diffraction nedm experiment @xcite ( this work ) and ( 2 ) is possible improvement of this method , ( 3 ) is gravitational level experiment @xcite , ( 4 ) is the ucn depolarization @xcite , ( 5 ) is proposal @xcite , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are the predictions of axion model with @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspondingly @xcite , scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "direct constraint on amplitude of t - odd monopole - dipole interaction of neutron with the matter was obtained .",
    "it is shown that the product of scalar to pseudo - scalar coupling constant @xmath70 for the range @xmath71 cm .",
    "this value can be improved on about @xmath72 times for the full scale setup for the neutron edm search by crystal - diffraction method , which is under construction now .",
