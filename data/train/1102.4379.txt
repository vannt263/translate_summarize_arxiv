    "one of the fundamental problems of cosmology is the initial singularity .",
    "it is commonly believed that near this singularity the physical evolution is governed by quantum mechanics . in the quantum cosmology framework",
    "the whole universe is represented through a wave function satisfying the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "it is well known that it represents the low energy approximation of string theory , however it contains some non - trivial leading order information .",
    "the development of quantum cosmology started at the beginning of the 80 s of last century and one of its main ideas is that the universe could be spontaneously nucleate out from nothing @xcite .",
    "after nucleation the universe can enter into a phase of inflationary expansion and continues its evolution to the present time .",
    "however , there are several important questions that remain to be solved like the general definition of probability , time and boundary conditions @xcite . in order to find a unique solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation",
    "it is necessary to impose boundary conditions . in the case of quantum mechanics",
    "there is an external setup and the boundary conditions can be imposed safely , however in 4-dimensional quantum cosmology there is nothing external to the universe and the question of which one is the correct prescription for the boundary condition of the universe is controversial @xcite .",
    "there are several proposals for the correct boundary conditions in quantum cosmology , for example , the no - boundary proposal of hartle and hawking @xcite , the tunneling proposal of vilenkin @xcite and the proposal of linde @xcite . in a recent development in quantum cosmology",
    "a principle of selection in the landscape of string vacua has been proposed in @xcite , in the context of the minisuperspace .",
    "moreover in @xcite different cosmologies were defined in terms of a wave function on a compact worldsheet of system of parafermions .",
    "much of the information is encoded in the wave function as function of the moduli space .",
    "another important issue is how to extract information of the wheeler - dewitt equation . in general",
    ", the configuration space used in quantum cosmology is an infinite dimensional space called superspace and it is not amenable to work with . in the study of homogeneous universes the infinite dimensional space is truncated to finite degrees of freedom , therefore obtaining a particular minisuperspace model .",
    "the reduction of superspace to minisuperspace is not a rigorous approximation scheme , however there is the hope that minisuperspace maintains some of the essential features of quantum cosmology . in classical cosmology homogeneity and isotropy",
    "are fundamental to describe the universe at large scale and therefore it is expected to have a minisuperspace description in quantum cosmology .    at very early times of the universe ,",
    "even before the planck time , the universe should be described by means of quantum cosmology that could take into account effects from string theory , supersymmetry and noncommutativity .",
    "string cosmology @xcite , quantum wormholes , baby universes and supersymmetric quantum cosmology has become very intensive research areas in quantum cosmology .",
    "quantum wormholes @xcite are instanton solutions and are important in the euclidean path integral formulation . in the third quantization approach , which is an adequate description of topology change in the path integral quantization ,",
    "the wave function is transformed into a quantum field operator which includes operators that create and destroy the so called baby universes .",
    "supersymmetric quantum cosmology is one of the main research areas @xcite . at the time of quantum creation of the universe it is possible that supersymmetry would not yet be broken and therefore could have very important consequences in the evolution of the universe .",
    "other very interesting effects that could arise in the very early universe are the effects of noncommutativity @xcite .    at the end of the late 1980s and early 1990s quantum decoherence ,",
    "the transition from quantum physics to classical physics , was an active research area in quantum cosmology @xcite ( for more recent reviews see , @xcite ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , quantum cosmology is developed in the phase space and the use of wigner function is showed to be a very useful approach to study decoherence .",
    "in fact , quantum mechanics in phase space is an appropriate formalism to describe quantum mechanical systems ( for a review see @xcite ) . the description using the wigner function",
    "has been of considerable interest and usefulness in quantum optics , nuclear and particle physics , condensed matter , statistical physics , etc . in particular , the description of semiclassical properties and the analysis of the classical limit is more clear in the wigner function formalism .",
    "the classical limit from quantum cosmology was studied also in @xcite , where the use of wigner function and quantum mechanics in phase space is fundamental .",
    "it has been argued that quantum decoherence is achieved if the density matrix is coarse grained , i.e. averaged over configuration or phase space variables , or in an alternative way , if the system interact with some environment which is not monitored .",
    "however the existence of classical correlations is another characteristic of the classical limit and requires the presence of sharp peaks of the wigner function , but a coarse graining produces a spreading of the distribution in phase space .",
    "the former arguments demand a subtle coarse graining in which there is a delicate balance between the existence of classical correlations and decoherence .",
    "a coarse graining could be modeled by a liouville equation with friction and diffusion terms @xcite .",
    "some other further results are described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanics in phase space is only one part of a complete and consistent type of quantization termed : _",
    "deformation quantization_. in this paper we formulate quantum cosmology in terms of deformation quantization and rewrite some results of @xcite in the context of this formalism .",
    "we will assume that the superspace ( of 3-metrics ) is flat and a fourier transform can be defined .",
    "this is fairly valid for the ample set of examples in two dimensions that we present in this paper .",
    "the case of curved minisuperspace will be discussed in a future communication .",
    "the deformation quantization formalism is an alternative approach to the canonical and path integral quantizations and has its origins in the seminal works by weyl @xcite , wigner @xcite , groenewold @xcite , moyal @xcite , and vey @xcite , and is based on the idea of treating with quantum mechanics on the phase space . in 1978 bayen , flato , fronsdal , lichnerowicz and sternheimer @xcite introduced its final form in which the quantization is understood as a deformation of the classical algebra of observables instead of a change in the nature of them .",
    "this quantization arises as a deformation of the usual product algebra of the smooth functions on the classical phase space and then as a deformation of the poisson bracket algebra .",
    "the deformed product is called the @xmath0product which has been proved to exist for any symplectic manifold @xcite , @xcite and more recently shown by kontsevich @xcite that it also exists for any poisson manifold . these results in principle allow us to perform the quantization of arbitrary poissonian or symplectic systems and to obtain in an easier way the classical limit due to the nature of the @xmath1product .",
    "our aim is to introduce this formalism in quantum cosmology and apply the results to simple models .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we survey the canonical hamiltonian formalism of general relativity and its canonical quantization . in section",
    "iii we construct the stratonovich - weyl quantizer , the star - product and the wigner functional .",
    "section iv is devoted to apply the deformation quantization procedure to several minisuperspace models and to obtain their wigner function . in subsection",
    "iv.a we treat de sitter model and calculate numerically the wigner function for the hartle - hawking , vilenkin and linde wave functions . in subsection iv.b",
    "we calculate analytically the wigner function for the kantowski - sachs model in ( non)commutative quantum cosmology and we interpret the results . in subsection iv.c",
    ", we obtain the wigner function for string cosmology with dilaton exponential potential in terms of the meijer s function . besides , in subsection iv.d the wigner function for the baby universes solutions is calculated by means of the moyal product and the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "finally , in section v we give our final remarks .",
    "in this section we briefly overview the hamiltonian formalism of general relativity . our presentation will not be complete and detailed information can be found in ref .",
    "our intention is only to introduce the notation and conventions for future reference along the paper .",
    "we start from the adm decomposition of general relativity and consider a pseudo riemannian manifold @xmath2 which is globally hyperbolic .",
    "thus , spacetime @xmath3 can be decomposed as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an spatial hypersurface and the metric of a foliation is : @xmath6 with signature @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the intrinsic metric on the hypersurface @xmath5 , @xmath9 is the lapse function and @xmath10 is the shift vector .",
    "the space of all riemannian 3-metrics and scalar matter configurations @xmath11 on @xmath5 is the so called _ superspace _ @xmath12 let us denote the space of riemannian metrics on @xmath5 as @xmath13 which is an infinite dimensional manifold .",
    "the moduli space @xmath14 , is then defined as the configuration space ( superspace ) modulo the group of diffeomorphisms @xmath15 i.e. @xmath16 or for pure gravity @xmath17 .    the corresponding phase space ( wheeler s phase superspace ) @xmath18 is given by the pairs @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the einstein - hilbert lagrangian . in the following we will deal with fields at the moment @xmath22 ( on @xmath5 ) and we put @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    the dynamics of general relativity coupled to matter in this foliation",

    "in this section we work in a flat superspace with flat metric @xmath68 . this case will allow us to introduce the weyl - wigner - groenewold - moyal ( wwgm ) formalism for gravitational systems in a direct way since the existence of the fourier transform is warranted .",

    "thus , at the semi - classical level , the statement made in @xcite about that the noncommutativity of the minisuperspace produces new possible states of the universe at early stages is confirmed .",
    "string cosmology with dilaton exponential potential is also discussed .",
    "we found the corresponding wheeler - dewitt - moyal equation and the equivalent differential - difference equation .",
    "these equations have an exact solution in terms of the hypergeometric and meijer s functions .",
    "baby universe solutions are also obtained in this context where the wigner function is calculated by finding the exact solution of its wheeler - dewitt - moyal equation consisting in two decoupled deformed harmonic oscillators in terms of laguerre polynomials .",
    "it is important to remark that this work opens the possibility of treating several important questions that remain unsolved in quantum cosmology with a novel approach .",
    "for instance , deformation quantization allows to deal with systems having phase spaces with nontrivial topology . in quantum cosmology",
    ", the existence of symmetries implies that the phase - superspace and in particular , the phase - minisuperspace will be reduced by the implementation of these symmetries leading to a non - trivial topological space with a non - flat metric .",
    "therefore , deformation quantization is able to treat these mentioned cases in a natural way .",
    "moreover the extension to supersymmetric quantum cosmology @xcite can be also treated applying the results of @xcite .",
    "another point to remark is that the wheeler - dewitt - moyal equation ( [ qhconstraint ] ) proposed in the present paper contains the generalized mass - shell equation and the wheeler - dewitt - vlasov transport equation in the flat minisuperspace @xcite encoded in its real an imaginary parts respectively .",
    "the former result was obtained using the moyal @xmath97product and then all the technics of deformation quantization developed for a long time can be apply to it .",
    "it is known that the mass - shell equation and the wheeler - dewitt - vlasov transport equation admits a suitable generalization to curved minisuperspace @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to deal with curved symplectic cases where the fedosov s approach could be applied in order to find the wheeler - dewitt - moyal equation in non - trivial phase superspaces and obtain the mass - shell and the wheeler - dewitt - vlasov equations .",
    "we will study this problem in a further communication .",
    "besides , as was mentioned before , the problem of obtaining the classical limit by implementing a coarse graining is relevant .",
    "it is possible to model a coarse graining through the liouville equation with friction and diffusion terms @xcite , this approach can be addressed in the context of the deformation quantization formalism .    to conclude",
    ", we consider that deformation quantization possesses various advantages in order to deal with more complicated problems in quantum cosmology for example , to treat systems with non trivial topology or with curved minisuperspaces .",
    "for these cases the canonical quantization could lead to the existence of nonhermitian operators which is avoided in deformation quantization as a result of the use of classical objects instead of operators .",
    "for these reasons more examples and further research is needed to develop this approximation .",

    "in addition r. c. and f. j. t. were partially supported by cofaa - ipn and by sip - ipn grants 20100684 and 20100887 .",
