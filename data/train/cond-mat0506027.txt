    "it is a textbook wisdom that if the de broglie wavelengths @xmath0 of particles are small in comparison with the characteristic space scales of a given problem , then the problem can be treated semiclassically . the commonly used wkb method ( phase integral approach ) @xcite - @xcite",
    "is intended for the conditions of  geometrical optics  , in which the gradient of the action @xmath1 is large , but slowly variable ( this is suggested also by it containing the factor @xmath2 , since we are dealing with a semiclassical approximation , in which @xmath2 is taken as small ) .",
    "the corresponding condition can be formulated more quantitatively @xcite as follows : @xmath0 must vary only slightly over distances of the order of itself @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is a classical momentum .",
    "however , this simple criterion is not a practical tool to estimate how accurate could be found semiclassical solutions of particular problems , since nothing is specified regarding the convergence of the semiclassical series .",
    "the criterion ( [ i1 ] ) does not work to estimate the magnitude of the error involved in the approximate calculation of physical quantities ( e.g. , matrix elements ) , neither to find the domain of validity in the complex plane in which the semiclassical solutions are defined .",
    "indeed from ( [ i1 ] ) one can conclude only that higher order corrections to semiclassical wave functions are small in the asymptotic regions , but this mathematical criterion has almost nothing to do with say the physical accuracy of semiclassical matrix elements which depends on the wave function accuracy in space regions providing main contributions into the matrix elements under consideration .",
    "for example , the energy eigenvalues are determined by the asymptotical region of the linear turning points ( i.e. , the region distant from these points ) , and as well by the proximity region to the second order turning points , since in the both regions the wave functions possess the largest values .    within the wkb method",
    "such kind of a physical accuracy estimation has been performed long ago by n. and p.o .",
    "frman @xcite .",
    "they analyzed higher order corrections to the semiclassical wave functions and found that although those are really small over @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is semiclassical parameter ) , the corrections are proportional to the factor @xmath8^{-2}$ ] , ( where @xmath9 is energy and @xmath10 is potential ) , and thus the function has non - integrable singularity at the linear turning points where @xmath8 = 0 $ ] ( or , within the alternative to wkb semiclassical formalism so - called extreme tunneling trajectory or instanton instanton approach @xcite - @xcite , the corrections are singular in the second order turning points ) .",
    "to surmount this problem in @xcite ( see also @xcite , and @xcite ) the analytical continuation of the correction function into the complex plane has been proposed , and it gives impractically bulky expressions even for simple model potentials . since this problem has relevance far beyond wkb treatment of a particular model potential , this is an issue of general interest to develop a simple and convenient in practice quantitative method to study the accuracy of the semiclassical approach , and it is the immediate motivation of the present paper to develop a systematic procedure how to do it .    the idea of our approach is to construct two linearly independent continuous ( with continuous first derivatives ) approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation , which in the asymptotic region coincide with semiclassic solutions , and in the vicinity of the turning points - with the exact solutions of the so - called comparison equation ( i.e. the exact solution of the schrdinger equation for the chosen appropriately approximate near the turning points potentials @xmath11 , henceforth will be referred to as the comparison potential ) . although , scanning the literature we found one rather old paper @xcite with a similar comparison equation approach , but our accuracy criterion is formulated as the majorant inequalities for a certain matrix ( which we find in the explicit analytical form and calculated numerically ) connecting our approximate and exact solutions in the finite space interval ( not only in the vicinity of the turning points ) . since this method has largely gone unnoticed in the study of semiclassics , we found it worthwhile to present its derivation in a short and explicit form , and also to point out its practical usability .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ theor ]",
    "we present the basic expressions necessary for our investigation . in this section",
    "we also present the main steps and qualitative idea of our method .",
    "section [ calcul ] contains our results .",
    "we derive the inequalities which enable us to find the finite space interval ( not at the isolated points ) where the solutions have to be matched , and calculate the @xmath12 coordinate dependent matrix connecting the approximate and exact solutions . since the semiclassical solutions of the harmonic potential coincide with the exact solutions , the accuracy of any semiclassically treated problem depends crucially on its potential energy anharmonicity .",
    "that is why as the touchstone to test our method the results presented in the section [ calcul ] are applied to an anharmonic oscillator in section [ anh ] .",
    "we end with some brief conclusions in the same section .",
    "technically the basic idea how to overcome the difficulty of the semiclassical solutions in the vicinity of the turning points is reduced to an appropriate ( admitting exact analytic solutions ) approximation of the potential near the turning points . after that step one has to match the asymptotics of this exact solution to the schrdinger equation for an approximate potential with the semiclassical solutions to the schrdinger equation for the potential under consideration ( i.e. approximate solutions of the exact potential ) far from the turning points . to illustrate main ideas of any semiclassic method ( and to retain compactness and transparency of expressions )",
    "we discuss here a one dimensional case . as it is well known @xcite in the wkb method solutions to the schrdinger equation are sought in the form @xmath13 where for the function @xmath1 called action the one particle schrdinger equation ( traditionally termed as hamilton jacoby equation ) reads as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a particle mass",
    ", @xmath16 is its energy , and @xmath10 is external field potential .",
    "since the system is supposed quasi - classical in its properties , we seek @xmath1 in the form of a series expanded in powers of @xmath2 .",
    "depending on normalization prefactor @xmath17 entering ( [ b1 ] ) can be also found but the corresponding equation ( referred traditionally as transport equation ) plays a pure passive role since it is fully determined by the action @xmath1 found as the solution of the hamilton - jacoby equation @xmath18 + \\frac{\\hbar ^2}{2 m}\\frac{\\partial ^2 a}{\\partial x^2 } = 0   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the spirit of the semiclassical approximation the last term ( @xmath19 ) is neglected .",
    "technically of course more convenient to use instead of @xmath2 an expansion over equivalent but dimensionless parameter @xmath20 we will call in what follows as semiclassical parameter and define as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a characteristic length of the problem , e.g. the tunneling distance , @xmath23 is a characteristic frequency , e.g. the oscillation frequency around the potential minimum .",
    "evidently the semiclassical parameter @xmath7 , and by its physical meaning it is determined by the ratio of the characteristic potential scale over the zero oscillation energy .",
    "we put @xmath24 , and use @xmath23 and @xmath22 to set corresponding dimensionless scales , i.e. we introduce dimensionless energy @xmath25 , dimensionless coordinate @xmath26 , dimensionless potential @xmath27 ( except where explicitely stated to the contrary and dimensions are necessary for understanding or numerical estimations ) .    the analogous to ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] )",
    "procedure for the schrdinger equation in the imaginary time ( instanton formalism , corresponding to the wick rotation in the phase space , when coordinates remain real valued @xmath28 but conjugated momenta become imaginary @xmath29 ) can be formulated as the following substitution for the wave function ( cf . to ( [ b1 ] ) ) @xmath30 where the action @xmath31 and we use the subscript @xmath16 to denote so - called euclidean action obtained from the wkb action @xmath1 after the wick rotation .",
    "performed above rotation is not a harmless change of variables .",
    "the deep meaning of this transformation within the instanton approach is related to redistribution of different terms between the hamilton - jacoby and the transport equations .",
    "indeed , like that is in the wkb method , eigenvalues for the ground and for the low - lying states are of the order of @xmath32 , while all other terms in ( [ b2 ] ) are of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore to perform a regular expansion over @xmath34 for the substitution ( [ b4 ] ) one has to remove the energy term from the hamilton - jacoby equation , and to include this term into the transport equation .",
    "besides in the first order over @xmath34 one can neglect the term with the second derivative of the prefactor . as a result of this redistributions",
    "the both equations are presented as @xmath35 instead of the wkb hamilton - jacoby equation ( [ b2 ] ) , and the transport equation is @xmath36 one can easily note by a simple inspection of the wkb ( [ b2 ] ) , ( [ b22 ] ) and of the instanton ( [ b5 ] ) , ( [ b6 ] ) equations that although the both semiclassical methods can be formulated neglecting terms of the order of @xmath34 , therefore possessing the same accuracy over @xmath34 , the solutions evidently coincide in the asymptotic classically forbidden region @xmath37 , but their behavior , number and type of turning points ( where any semiclassic approximation does not work ) are quite different .",
    "for example in the wkb formalism there are two turning points where @xmath38 around each minimum of the potential , while in the instanton approach since the energy does not enter the hamilton - jacoby equation ( thus one can say that no classically accessible regions at all ) the turning points are extremal points ( minima for the case ) of the potential . furthermore as a consequence of this difference , in the wkb method all turning points are linear , whereas in the instanton approach they are second order ( quadratic over @xmath39 )",
    "armed with this knowledge we are in the position now to construct our approximants . let us introduce besides the comparison potential @xmath11 , one more specially chosen potential @xmath40 ( henceforth will be referred to as the semiclassical potential ) .",
    "this potential is chosen by the requirement that the exact solutions to the schrdinger equation with @xmath40 coincide asymptotically with the semiclassical solutions to the schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath41 the problem under study . thus according to the construction , the semiclassical wave function @xmath42 satisfies the equation @xmath43 and from here we can relate the semiclassical potential ( @xmath44 ) with the bare one ( @xmath41 ) @xmath45 in the vicinity of the first order or of the second order ( superscripts 1 or 2 ) turning points .    since near the turning point @xmath46 the prefactors @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is an integer number which occurs from the transport equation ( [ b6 ] ) solution at the energy @xmath50 ) the potential @xmath51 at @xmath52 is singular and negative , and @xmath53 has the same singularity ( @xmath54 ) but positive .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that near the wkb linear turning points we have deal with the @xmath51 well , whereas near the second order instanton turning points one has to treat the potential barrier @xmath53",
    ". it might be useful to illustrate the essential features of the introduced above potentials @xmath55 and @xmath40 applying the definition ( [ ac2 ] ) to a simple ( but the generic touchstone ) example of the following anharmonic oscillator @xmath56 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we show in fig .",
    "1 the semiclassical and the comparison potentials associated with ( [ ac15 ] ) for the wkb ( fig . 1a ) and instanton ( fig .",
    "1b ) methods ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and the energy window corresponds to @xmath59 excited state of the potential ( [ ac15 ] ) ) .",
    "the key elements to construct our approximants are the following combinations related to probability flows to and from the turning points @xmath60 where @xmath61 and analogously for @xmath62 the flow function @xmath63 is given by ( [ ac3 ] ) where the integration limits are from @xmath64 to @xmath65 . since the exact wave functions are continuous with continuous first derivatives ( providing due to these features the continuity of the density probability currents ) , the idea of our procedure is to require the same from the approximate wave functions .",
    "the integrals entering @xmath66 and @xmath63 can be calculated easily for any form of the potential , and the maximum accuracy of the any semiclassical approach can be achieved upon the matching of the approximate solutions at the characteristic points @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the points @xmath69 do exist in the case when the potentials @xmath55 and @xmath40 intersect in the region where the approximate wave functions @xmath42 and @xmath70 are monotone ones .",
    "it is easy to realize ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "1 ) that the both points occur in the vicinity of the linear turning points for the potentials with @xmath71 .",
    "one such a point disappears when the potential turning point becomes the inflection point , and there are no @xmath69 points at all for @xmath72 . in the vicinity of the second order turning point",
    "the comparison potential @xmath55 is a parabolic one .",
    "the curvature of the latter potential can be always chosen to guarantee the two intersection points always exist .",
    "the choice of the comparison potential corresponds to a certain renormalization ( @xmath73 ) of the characteristic oscillation frequency @xmath74 .",
    "note in passing that the approach we are advocating here conceptually close ( although not identical ) to the scale transformation proposed by miller and good @xcite and further developed in@xcite .    thus the conditions @xmath68 allow us to construct well controlled approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation depends on the deviation of the approximate wave functions from the exact ones in the vicinity of the characteristic points @xmath69 . in own",
    "turn , the deviation is determined by the higher over @xmath75 terms of the potential @xmath41 which are not included in the harmonic comparison potential @xmath55 .",
    "include explicitely the corresponding higher order terms to distinguish @xmath55 and @xmath40 potentials , we find in the vicinity of the linear turning points @xmath76 where the universal numerical constant @xmath77 , and the second term in the r.h.s .",
    "is related to deviation of the bare potential from the linear one .",
    "the same manner near the second order turning points @xmath78 where the universal constant @xmath79 is zero for the lowest vibrational states @xmath80 , and the last term describes non - parabolicity of the potential .",
    "note that unlike the semiclassical action which within the instanton method is independent of quantum numbers @xmath49 , the position of the characteristic points does depend on @xmath49 , and the @xmath69 points are placed near the boundaries of the classically accessible region .",
    "now we are in the position to construct the approximant wave functions @xmath81 which are the solutions to the schrdinger equation with the following piecewise smooth approximating potential @xmath82 the wave functions calculated according to ( [ ac6 ] ) in the framework of the instanton approach close to the weber functions in the classically accessible regions , but their exponentially decaying tails in the classically forbidden regions correspond to the exact ( bare ) potential , not to its harmonic approximant .",
    "analogously in the wkb method these functions ( [ ac6 ] ) coincide with the semiclassical ones out of the interval @xmath83 , and with the airy functions in this interval .    to proceed further on we have to relate our approximant wave functions ( [ ac6 ] ) and two linearly independent solutions to the bare schrdinger equation @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it can be written down formally as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the green function for the schrdinger equation with the potential ( [ ac7 ] ) , @xmath89 \\ , ; \\ , x_1 \\leq",
    "x    \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant in ( [ ins2 ] ) is the wronskian equal to @xmath90 in the instanton method , and @xmath91 within the wkb approach . in ( [ ac8 ] ) @xmath92 ( the same definition for @xmath93 ) , and we take the turning point @xmath46 , where the functions @xmath94 and @xmath93 are close to each other at the lower integration limit .",
    "the solution to the integral equation ( [ ac8 ] ) is expressed as the neumann series expansion , @xmath95 and the @xmath15-th order term can be factorized and estimated as @xmath96 the integrals entering this estimation @xmath97 contain the @xmath12 matrix with the following matrix elements @xmath98 it is convenient to introduce the matrix @xmath99 relating the @xmath49-th order wave function correction @xmath100 with the wave function @xmath93 @xmath101 and the full connection matrix between the exact and approximate wave functions @xmath102 is @xmath103 according to the inequality ( [ ins4 ] ) @xmath104 where @xmath105 combining finally the expressions ( [ ins8 ] ) - ( [ ins10 ] ) we end up with the upper and lower bounds for the correction matrix @xmath106 estimation @xmath107 we conclude from ( [ ins4 ] ) , ( [ ac9 ] ) that the neumann series posses an absolute convergence if all the matrix elements @xmath108 are finite .",
    "besides , unlike the correction functions introduced within the frman approach @xcite , the integrals in ( [ ac9 ] ) have no singularities on the real axis . evidently the integrals ( [ ac9 ] ) are finite with the oscillating wkb functions , since the perturbation potential @xmath109 is not zero only in the close proximity to the characteristic points @xmath69 .",
    "however in the instanton method due to mixing of increasing and decreasing exponents , the matrix elements @xmath110 is divergent . despite of this divergency the product @xmath111 , we are only interested in , is finite , and it is convenient to perform one more transformation to exclude explicitely this divergency .",
    "technically one can easily eliminate the both off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath112 and thus to get rid of the divergency of the ( exponentially decreasing solution @xmath113 ) amplitude due to the contribution to the @xmath113 the exponentially increasing solution @xmath114 .",
    "these linear transformations renormalize the correction matrix elements @xmath110 and @xmath115 as follows @xmath116 where the renormalized matrix elements @xmath117 and @xmath118 read as @xmath119 and @xmath120 now all the integrals entering @xmath118 , @xmath117 , and @xmath121 are convergent and finite at any @xmath39 , the correction matrix @xmath112 is transformed into the diagonal and positively defined matrix @xmath122 @xmath123 the @xmath49-th order corrections in the instanton approach satisfy the inequality @xmath124 explicit summation of r.h.s in ( [ ac13 ] ) gives us the upper and the lower bound limits for the solutions of the initial schrdinger equation , i.e. the stripe where increasing and decreasing solutions are confined @xmath125 it is our main result in this paper , and the stripe ( [ ac14 ] ) gives the accuracy of the semiclassical instanton method . besides we are in the position now to estimate the contribution of increasing semiclassical solutions into decreasing ones ( what is relevant to solve eigenvalue problems ) .",
    "the summation convergent majorant series enables us to estimate the upper bound for this contribution @xmath126 therefore at @xmath127 the summation of all order perturbation terms enhances the 1-st order correction by the factor @xmath128 .",
    "analogously the majorant estimates described above can be used to construct the connection matrices linking the semiclassical solutions through the turning points .",
    "the comparison of the bare connection matrices ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with the matrices calculated accordingly to ( [ ac9 ] ) - ( [ ac12 ] ) provides the estimates for the eigenvalue accuracy .",
    "as it was mentioned already , for the wkb method the procedure is even more simple , since no any divergency and therefore no need to perform the transformation ( [ ac10 ] ) . the similar to ( [ ins4 ] ) - ( [ ins5 ] )",
    "factorization gives the @xmath112 matrix ( cf . with ( [ ins10 ] ) for the instanton approach ) @xmath129 and the estimations for the @xmath49-th order contribution ( cf . with ( [ ac13 ] ) can be formulated now as @xmath130 and @xmath131 where we denote @xmath132 .",
    "correspondingly to ( [ ins14 ] ) , ( [ ins15 ] ) the diagonal and off - diagonal correction matrix elements are bounded from above @xmath133 and @xmath134 the whole procedure we employed is rationalized in the fig .",
    "2 , where we compare the solutions to the comparison equation with the anharmonic oscillator semiclassical wave functions computed within the instanton and wkb approaches and indicate the optimal matching points @xmath135 found accordingly to the condition @xmath136 .",
    "in closing let us illustrate how our estimations ( [ ac14 ] ) , ( [ ins15 ] ) work for a strongly anharmonic potential ( [ ac15 ] ) .",
    "although it is not great triumph to re - derive the known results , our derivation illustrates several characteristic features of the correction matrix techniques derived in the section [ calcul ] : better accuracy , rapid convergence , simple disposal of divergences , and ease of computation in particular .",
    "the main message of our consideration in the precedent section [ calcul ] is that the quantitative accuracy of the semiclassics depends crucially on the proximity of the semiclassical wave functions to the solutions of the comparison equation in the region of the asymptotically smooth matching .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to improve the accuracy by taking into account the anharmonic corrections to the comparison potential @xmath11 .",
    "however , since the eigenvalues and the normalization of the wave functions are almost independent of the detailed behavior in the vicinity of the linear turning points ( because near these points , situated at the boundaries of the classically accessible region , the probability density ( i.e. @xmath137 ) is exponentially small ) this idea is useless for the wkb approach .",
    "in contrast with this , for the instanton method , the accuracy can be improved considerably upon including the anharmonic corrections into the comparison potential .",
    "indeed , within the instanton method the accuracy is determined by the vicinity of the second order turning points where the wave functions acquire the largest values ( and just in this region the smooth matching described above has to be performed ) .",
    "let us remind first the traditional ( but formulated within the semiclassical framework ) perturbation theory . keeping in the transport equation ( [ b22 ] ) the second derivative of the prefactor @xmath138 , the system of the equations of hamilton - jacoby ( [ b2 ] ) and the exact transport equation @xmath139 = 0   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are exactly equivalent to the schrdinger equation under consideration .",
    "for the second order turning points the anharmonic corrections @xmath140 can be considered as a perturbation and it is convenient to include this perturbation @xmath141 into the transport equation ( [ anh1 ] ) . then the comparison equation is reduced to the inhomogeneous weber equation , and its solutions can be expanded over the weber functions @xmath142 @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the wave function normalization factor , the expansion coefficients are proportional to the small parameters @xmath145 , and @xmath146 , and the weber function index @xmath147 is related to the energy eigenvalue @xmath148 .",
    "this expansion ( [ anh3 ] ) looks like a conventional perturbation series , but it does not . in the comparison equation",
    "we are keeping the both ( decreasing and increasing ) waves , and as a result of it , the indices of the weber functions @xmath149 are not integer numbers . in the first order over the perturbation @xmath141",
    "the only non - zero coefficients in ( [ anh3 ] ) correspond to the following selection rules @xmath150 for the cubic and fourth order anharmonic corrections respectively .",
    "explicitely these non - zero expansion coefficients can be found by straitforward calculations , and they are @xmath151 @xmath152 on equal footing we can find the perturbative corrections to the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rules , and therefore the eigenvalues .",
    "the calculation is straightforward , though deserves some precaution and rather tedious .",
    "skipping a large amount of tedious algebra we end up with the fractional part of the quantum number @xmath147 @xmath153 and up to the second order over the anharmonic perturbation @xmath141 we find @xmath154 however the described standard perturbative approach leads to qualitatively wrong features of the solutions .",
    "for example , the wave functions ( [ anh3 ] ) , ( [ anh5 ] ) are represented as a product of @xmath147 independent exponential factors and dependent of @xmath147 polynomials .",
    "as it is well known @xcite in one dimension the @xmath49-th excited state wave function must have @xmath49 zeros ( and the number of zeros may not be changed by any perturbation ) .",
    "however in the @xmath15-th order perturbation theory approximation , the wave function ( [ anh3 ] ) corresponding to a certain excited state @xmath49 contains hermitian polynomials up to the order @xmath155 or @xmath156 for the cubic or quartic anharmonic perturbations , respectively .",
    "therefore some false zeros of the wave function appears in the standard perturbation theory , and the region where the function oscillates becomes more and more wide in the higher order over perturbations approximation .",
    "the contributions of these qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect higher order terms become dominating in the asymptotic region at @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "it conforms with the classical results due to bender and wu @xcite , @xcite who have shown that for the quartic anharmonic potential ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 in ( [ ac15 ] ) ) the convergency radius is zero .",
    "moreover , for @xmath161 and for an arbitrary small @xmath162 ( [ ac15 ] ) is the cubic anharmonic potential , i.e. , the decay one .",
    "thus it should have only complex eigenvalues , what is not the case for the eigenvalues calculated within the perturbation theory .",
    "the method we developed in section [ calcul ] enables us not only to estimate more accurate the anharmonic corrections to the eigenvalues , and to bring the whole schema of the calculations in a more elegant form .",
    "our finding of the correction matrices is not merely to surpass a technical difficulty of the standard perturbative method , it is more one of principle , and we will show that the method has no drawbacks of the perturbation theory .",
    "the proof proceeds as follows .",
    "let us consider first the instanton method for the anharmonic potential ( [ anh1 ] ) possessing one second order turning point @xmath163 .",
    "as it was shown in the section [ calcul ] one has to find also two other characteristic points which are the roots of the equation ( [ ac3 ] ) .",
    "we denote the points as @xmath164 , and @xmath165 ( to refer by the self - explanatory subscripts @xmath166 and @xmath167 to the left and to the right from the turning point @xmath168 ) . at the next step using the correction matrices introduced in the section [ calcul ] , we can define formally the transformation of our approximate wave functions ( [ ac6 ] ) into the unknown exact wave functions @xmath94 as @xmath169 where as above the subscripts @xmath166 and @xmath167 refer to the wave functions in the regions to the left and to the right from the turning point @xmath168 .",
    "we do not know the correction matrix @xmath106 but we do know ( see ( [ ins6 ] ) - ( [ ac11 ] ) ) the boundary estimations for the matrix .    the eq .",
    "( [ anh16 ] ) can be used also to correct the known at the second order turning point the connection matrix @xmath170 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed the connection matrices link the semiclassical solutions in the @xmath39-regions to the left and to the right from the turning points . for the isolated second order turning point ( we are dealing within the instanton method ) ,",
    "the connection matrix @xmath170 links the exponentially increasing and decreasing solutions in the space regions separated by the turning point .",
    "the condition ensuring the correct asymptotic behavior is the quantization rule for this case which can be formulated as @xmath171 ( @xmath172 are the matrix elements of the connection matrix @xmath170 ) . since in the regions to the left and to the right from the turning point our approximate solutions @xmath93 coincide by their definition ( [ ac6 ] ) with the semiclassical ones , the correction matrix method enables us to correct the quantization rule too .",
    "namely , the quantization rules are formulated within the connection matrix technique read now as @xmath173 where the stokes constant for the second order turning point @xcite is @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the correction matrices at the @xmath165 or @xmath164 characteristic points respectively . expanding the gamma function entering ( [ anh7 ] ) around the integer numbers , i.e. , as above ( [ anh6 ] ) , @xmath176 one can find from the equation ( [ anh7 ] ) the fractional part of the quantum number . if we were known the correction matrix @xmath106 the solution of ( [ anh7 ] )",
    "would provide the exact eigenvalues .",
    "but we do know only the estimations from below and from above for the @xmath106 matrix . in the same spirit",
    "we can calculate the estimations for the correction matrices ( and therefore for the eigenvalues ) within the wkb approach .",
    "luckily it turns out that the mathematical nature of the semiclassical problem is on our side here , and , in fact , even the first order estimation from below @xmath177 ( [ ins6 ] ) gives already the accuracy comparable with the standard perturbation procedure , and the estimation from above ( [ ins8 ] ) gives the eigenvalues almost indistinguishable from the  exact  ones obtained by the numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian .",
    "the same true for the wave functions found by the correction matrix technique .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 @xmath178 for the same anharmonic potential ( [ ac15 ] ) with @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "clearly the exact numerical results and those obtained by our correction matrix techniques are correct qualitatively and in the very good quantitative agreement ( indistinguishable starting from the second order approximation ) unlike the situation with the standard perturbation theory .",
    "besides we present in the table the eigenvalues of the anharmonic potential .",
    "we take the anharmonic coefficients @xmath162 and @xmath179 in ( [ ac15 ] ) so large , that corresponding perturbations of the eigen values are of the order of the bare harmonic frequency ( one in our dimensionless units @xmath180 ) . in the table",
    "the eigenvalues found by the numerical diagonalization are presented in the column @xmath181 .",
    "the column @xmath182 contains the harmonic approximation results , the column @xmath183 is the second order perturbation theory ( [ anh8 ] ) , and the columns @xmath184 and @xmath185 results are obtained by applying our correction matrix technique : estimation from below with the first order correction matrix ( [ ins6 ] ) in the column @xmath184 , and the estimation from above with the matrix ( [ ins8 ] ) in the column @xmath185 .    to conclude , as we have shown how to estimate the corrections to the main technical tool for the semiclassical approach , the connection matrices linking the solutions to the left and to the right from the turning points .",
    "everything ( e.g. , the upper and the lower bounds for @xmath186 ) is determined by the matrices @xmath121 and @xmath117 .",
    "approximating to ( [ ac15 ] ) potential is found from ( [ ac4 ] ) and after that straightforward computing according to ( [ ac9 ] ) the matrices @xmath187 and their renormalization ( [ ac12 ] ) leads to the corrections we are looking for , presented in the fig .",
    "4 , which allow us to estimate the accuracy of the semiclassical eigenstates and eigenfunctions .",
    "we conclude that even for a strongly anharmonic potential the both methods ( wkb and instanton ) are fairly accurate ones ( about @xmath188 ) up to the energy close to the potential barrier top ( in the region of negative curvature , we already discussed above ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in the frame work of the conventional perturbation theory ( due to zero convergency radius with respect to @xmath179 coefficient in ( [ ac15 ] ) ) pure computational problems to get the same accuracy become nearly unsurmountable , see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our findings show that to estimate quantitatively the semiclassical accuracy it is enough to compare two linearly independent ( with the same quantum number ) solutions of the initial potential under study , and of the approximating piecewise smooth potential .",
    "the main advantage of the approach is related to the appropriate ( [ ac4 ] ) , ( [ ac7 ] ) choice of the approximating potential , providing absolutely convergent majorant series ( [ ac8 ] ) for the solutions .",
    "actually our correction matrix technique is a fairly universal one and enables to estimate ( and improve ! ) the semiclassical accuracy for arbitrary one dimensional potentials with any combination of the turning and of the crossing points .",
