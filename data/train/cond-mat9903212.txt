    "recently single - particle properties of electrons in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) systems have attracted considerable interest . by calculating the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath0 @xcite and the momentum distribution function @xmath1 around the fermi surface , hu and das sarma @xcite",
    "have clarified that a clean q1d electron system in a semiconductor quantum wire shows the luttinger liquid behavior , whereas even slightest amount of impurities restores the fermi surface and the fermi - liquid behavior remains . within an one - band model , they calculated the self - energy due to electron - electron coulomb interaction for an unclean q1d system by using the leading - order gw dynamical screening approximation.@xcite this self - energy gives rise to the inelastic coulomb scattering rate which plays a fundamental role in measurement of the quasiparticle lifetime in q1d doped systems .",
    "in the inelastic - scattering processes , the quasiparticle loses energy each time it scatters and its lifetime provides information about the different excitation channels its energy relaxation occurred through.@xcite    this paper is devoted to study the collective excitation and the coulomb inelastic - scattering rate in a multisubband q1d doped semiconductor .",
    "the numerical calculations are applied to two strongly coupled gaas / algaas quantum wires in which the occupation of higher subbands provides more scattering channels .",
    "we show that the intersubband coupling and intersubband excitations can be important in the energy relaxation process .",
    "by assuming zero thickness in the @xmath2 direction , the subband energies @xmath3 and the wave functions @xmath4 are obtained from the numerical solution of the coupled one - dimensional schrdinger equation in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the coulomb inelastic - scattering rate of an electron in a subband @xmath6 with momentum @xmath7 is obtained @xcite by the imaginary part of the screened exchange self - energy @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the single - particle energy with  @xmath10 being the chemical potential and @xmath11 the electron effective mass in gaas . at zero temperature @xcite",
    ", the screened exchange self - energy is given by @xmath12 = \\frac{i}{(2\\pi ) ^{2}}\\int dq\\int d\\omega ^{\\prime } \\times\\ ] ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the bare green s function of noninteracting electrons and @xmath15 is the dynamically screened electron - electron interaction potential .",
    "the self - energy @xmath8 $ ] was written by taking the leading pertubative term in an expansion in the dynamically screened rpa exchange interaction ( gw approximation ) .    similarly to the one - band model@xcite , the self - energy in eq.([self1 ] ) can be separated into the frequency - independent exchange and the correlation part , @xmath8 = \\sigma _ { n}^{ex}(k)+\\sigma _ { n}^{cor}\\left [ k,\\xi _ { n}(k)\\right ] .$ ] the exchange part is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fermi - dirac distribution function and @xmath18 is the multisubband electron - electron bare interaction . notice that @xmath19 is real because the bare interaction potential @xmath18 is totally real .",
    "therefore , one only needs to analyze the imaginary part of @xmath20 $ ] , since it gives rise to the imaginary part of the self - energy which we are interested in .",
    "after some algebra , we find that the coulomb inelastic - scattering rate for an electron in a subband @xmath6 with momentum @xmath7 is given by @xmath21 , \\ ] ] with @xmath22 @xmath23 -v_{nn^{\\prime } n^{\\prime } n}^{b}(q)\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the standard step function . in the above equation ,",
    "the frequency integration has already been carried out , since the bare green s function @xmath26 can be written as a delta function of @xmath27 .",
    "in this section , we will present some numerical results of @xmath28 within a two - subband model ( @xmath29 ) . in order to understand the inelastic coulomb scattering processes of the q1d electron gas , we will firstly analyze the collective excitation dispersion relation in this multisubband system to show the different channels of energy relaxation .",
    "we consider two strongly double symmetric gaas / algaas quantum wires of widths @xmath30   and barrier height @xmath31 mev . between them",
    "there is a potential barrier of width @xmath32  .",
    "the total density of electrons is taken as @xmath33 @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the effective born radius with @xmath36 being the dielectric constant of the static lattice and @xmath37 the electron charge .",
    "in such a system , the electron densities in the first @xmath38 and the second @xmath39 subbands are @xmath40 @xmath34 and @xmath41 @xmath34 , respectively . fig . 1 shows the collective excitation dispersion relation of the q1d electron gas .",
    "we find two intrasubband collective excitation modes indicated by @xmath42 and @xmath43 and two intersubband modes indicated by @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the intrasubband plasmon dispersions are approximately linear in the long - wavelength limit , while the intersubband ones have finite energy values at @xmath46 .",
    "the low - energy intrasubband plasmon is mainly due to the second subband , while the high - energy one is mainly due to the first subband .",
    "we also see a quite large depolarization shift of the intersubband plasmon mode @xmath44 .",
    "the shadow areas indicated by @xmath47 present the quasiparticle excitation regions which can result in landau damping of the collective excitation modes .",
    "notice that , due to the symmetry of the system , the intrasubband and intersubband modes do not couple to each other in such a way that the intersubband quasiparticle excitations do not damp the intrasubband plasmon modes and vice versa.@xcite the existence of two undamped intersubband collective modes is a particular feature of the q1d system with two occupied subbands .",
    "the occupation of the second subband opens up a gap inside the inter - subband quasiparticle excitations @xmath48 region where the intersubband mode @xmath45 appears .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the coulomb inelastic - scattering rate @xmath49 as a function of the electron wave vector @xmath7 in this two subband coupled quantum wire system .",
    "the parameters of the system are the same as in fig .",
    "the solid curves denote the intrasubband scattering rate for which the initial and final states of the electron are in the same subband .",
    "the dotted ones correspond to the intersubband scattering rate .",
    "2(a ) shows the scattering rate for an electron initially in the first conduction subband .",
    "the numerical results show that the intrasubband scattering rate @xmath50 at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) as it should be .",
    "the scattering rate @xmath55 presents a very pronounced peak at about @xmath56 @xmath57 corresponding to the contribution from the plasmon excitation of the first subband .",
    "such a contribution opens up a channel through which the electron energy can relax by emitting one plasmon .",
    "this strong peak is due to the onset of the scattering of the plasmon mode @xmath58 restricted by the conservation of energy and momentum , joining up with the divergency of the density of states at the bottom of the 1d subband .",
    "we also observe the contributions from the quasiparticle excitation of the second subband at small wave vectors ( @xmath59 ) , and from the plasmon excitation of the second subband , peaked at @xmath60 .",
    "the intersubband scattering rate @xmath61 ( dotted line ) has contributions from the intersubband plasmon excitation ( high - energy ) , at @xmath62 @xmath34 , and from quasiparticle intersubband excitation ( region @xmath48 ) , at small values of wave vectors .",
    "the scattering rate @xmath61 is much smaller than  @xmath63 because the corresponding intersubband transition is from lower to higher subband and , moreover , intersubband plasmon has higher energy .",
    "the sum of the two curves in fig .",
    "2(a ) yields the total scattering rate for an electron in the first subband .",
    "2(b ) shows the scattering rate for electrons in the second subband .",
    "the intrasubband scattering rate @xmath64 ( solid curve ) also shows a pronounced peak at @xmath65 @xmath66 corresponding to the scattering of the intrasubband plasmon mode @xmath58 while the scattering from the plasmon mode @xmath43 of the second subband only leads to a small peak at @xmath67 @xmath34 . there is a small shoulder between the first and the second subband plasmon excitation .",
    "this shoulder denotes the contribution of the intrasubband quasiparticle excitation ( region @xmath68 ) to the @xmath69 .",
    "the strong scattering of the plasmon @xmath42 of the first subband to the @xmath64 indicates a strong coupling of the in - plane motion of the collective excitations from the different subbands . from @xmath69 and @xmath55",
    ", we also observe a relatively large contribution from @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "this is because the virtue intersubband scattering ( coupling ) makes the energy - momentum conservation less restrictive in the scattering processes . the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2(b ) shows the contribution from the intersubband plasmon excitation .",
    "one sees that the intersubband scattering @xmath72 has a peak located at lower momentum @xmath7 comparing to that of @xmath61 . in the scattering process from the second to the first subband ,",
    "the electron transfer its potential energy to kinetic energy which facilitates the scattering .",
    "our results show that the plasmon excitations of the first subband are the most important scattering mechanism for electrons in both subbands .",
    "this is so because : ( i ) the strong intersubband coupling and ( ii ) there are more occupied states in the first subband on which the self - energy effects are stronger and the scattering becomes more pronounced .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the multisubband collective excitations and the coulomb inelastic - scattering rate of a quasi - one - dimensional electron gas in two strongly coupled quantum wires with two occupied subbands .",
    "we have analyzed the different modes of collective excitations and the corresponding scattering channels through which the electrons , in the different subbands , lose their energies .",
    "the role of each excitation mode in the inelastic - scattering relaxation process is clarified .",
    "we find that the plasmons in the lowest subband are responsible for the most important scattering channel even for the electrons in higher subbands .",
    "the intersubband plasmon modes open up more scattering channels , but their scattering rates are about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the main scattering mechanism .",
