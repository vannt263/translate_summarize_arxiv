    "zeeman doppler mapping ( zdm ) has made considerable progress over recent years , thanks mainly to powerful new spectrographs which yield high s / n ratio polarised spectra in all 4 stokes  @xmath3 parameters .",
    "whereas in the early days of doppler mapping , intensity spectra only were used to derive abundance maps ( see e.g. rice et al . 1989 ) , the addition of spectra in circular polarisation ( stokes  @xmath1 ) soon opened up the possibility to simultaneously determine both the magnetic field structure and the abundance distributions of various chemical elements .",
    "however , right in the first days of zdm brown et al .",
    "( 1991 ) gave a caveat : linear polarisation data ( stokes  @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) would be needed to derive reliable magnetic maps for ap stars .",
    "still , even into the new millennium , doppler maps of magnetic stars have been published , based on stokes  @xmath0 and @xmath1 only ( kochukhov et al .",
    "2002 , lftinger et al .",
    "2010 ) , although instruments capable of determining accurate @xmath4 and @xmath5 profiles have by now been developed .",
    "numerous doppler maps of magnetic stars even rely solely on stokes  @xmath0 ( piskunov et al .",
    "1998 , kuschnig et al .",
    "1998 , lftinger et al . 1998 , 2003 ) .",
    "the reader of the articles cited will surely note that elemental over - abundances resulting from doppler imaging frequently appear quite unrealistic .",
    "consider for example the results for @xmath6cas where according to kuschnig et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in parts of the atmosphere @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath8psc , piskunov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that over a considerable part of the surface @xmath9 , while cr , according to their figure  1 , varies between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ! for comparison , the solar abundance is @xmath12 ( asplund et al .",
    "2009).the question not only arises how possibly a star can contain more chromium than hydrogen in parts of its atmosphere but also how such an enormous over - abundance could build up and whether such an atmosphere could ever remain stable .",
    "note that the modelling of equilibrium stratifications in ap stars ( leblanc et al .",
    "2009 , alecian & stift 2007 ) has not so far yielded a single case with such extreme iron or chromium abundances .",
    "could these excessive values not rather be due to serious shortcomings in the zdm procedure ?",
    "fortunately , high quality stokes  @xmath13 profiles have now become available and this might be thought to ensure at last uniqueness of the magnetic and abundance maps .",
    "based on recently obtained stokes  @xmath3 profiles , a major revision both of the previously published magnetic geometry and of the elemental abundance distributions of the famous ap star @xmath14cvn has taken place .",
    "the new maps appear to validate the analysis of brown et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . whereas the stokes  @xmath0 and @xmath1 based analysis by kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( = k02 ) yielded a minimum field of @xmath15 kg and a maximum field of @xmath16 kg , these values have now become @xmath17 kg and @xmath18 kg respectively ( kochukhov & wade 2010 ) ( = k10 ) ; we see also substantial changes in the structure both of the meridional and the azimuthal field .",
    "the respective field distributions from k02 and k10 at phases 0.20 and 0.40 are strikingly different and it is quite surprising to see that a sharp maximum in field strength is accompanied by an almost horizontal inclination of the magnetic field .",
    "the k10 iron maps bear little resemblance to the k02 maps , and there are a few noticeable differences in the chromium maps ; there is no obvious correlation between field direction or strength and the abundance features .",
    "a 2.3dex amplitude in the fe abundances has increased to a staggering 4.9dex , a fact that can not be explained by magnetic intensification ( see stift & leone 2003 ) .",
    "however , there are not only these differences between the old and the new maps that are distressing , but there is also the question of ( optimum ) regularisation . in an ill - posed problem such as zdm ,",
    "regularisation is necessary to obtain meaningful and hopefully unique maps of elemental abundances and of the magnetic field vector ; these maps should combine minimum structure ( complexity ) with a good fit to the observed stokes  @xmath3 profiles . in the past",
    ", maximum entropy regularisation has been used extensively ( see e.g. vogt et al .",
    "1987 ) , but nowadays it is largely replaced by tikhonov regularisation which minimises the sum of the squared differences between the unknowns ( abundances , magnetic field components ) of any combination of 2 surface elements ( see eq.5 of k10 ) .",
    "please keep in mind that both tikhonov and maximum entropy regularisation are purely mathematical constraints which do not necessarily reflect the physical reality : radiatively driven diffusion in magnetic stellar atmospheres might not lead to smooth but rather to patchy surface structure ( alecian & stift 2010 ) .",
    "even with all 4  stokes parameters used by k10 , the magnetic geometry depends in a sensitive way and to an uncanny degree on the value of the regularisation parameter .",
    "obviously , the smaller the latter gets , the more fine structure in the magnetic field appears , but in addition , changes in the regularisation parameter make field maxima not only change appreciably in value but these maxima also appear to travel over substantial distances to new locations ( compare figures 6 and 8 in k10 ) . in that context the reader of the k10 paper , having access to abundance maps for only 2 values of the regularisation parameter , is certainly entitled to ask himself whether this travel proceeds smoothly or rather in erratic jumps .",
    "the reader will also note that stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 data for a mere 3 or 4 out of 20 phases are mainly responsible for the complete revision of the surface abundance and field strength maps ( this will be discussed in section  7 ) while there are still a lot of profiles that have not been fitted to within the estimated observational errors .",
    "in an atlas12 model atmosphere with @xmath19k , @xmath20 ( all other elements have solar abundances ) .",
    "the curves pertain to iron abundances ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 and are plotted relative to the temperature profile of the @xmath23 model.,width=317 ]    apparently the method used by k10 is not robust , since the results depend too strongly on the value of the regularisation parameter . as k10 have shown themselves in their figures 6 and 8 , the value of the regularisation parameter not only determines the resolution of the maps  as one would ideally expect  but to an uncomfortable degree also their large - scale structure .",
    "is this fact due to some numerical instability and/or to weird behaviour of the tikhonov regularisation , or is it rather indicative of something even more disturbing , i.e. do we have to admit that the input physics used so far by k10 are seriously inadequate ? could it be that the zdm code yields a beautiful , but incorrect and unphysical solution that also depends on erroneous assumptions as to , for example , the atmospheric structure ?",
    "this is what we will explore in the following sections .",
    "any thorough investigation of zdm and its input physics requires a set of powerful numerical codes .",
    "one has to be able to calculate highly accurate stokes profiles for stellar atmospheres permeated by strong magnetic fields of various geometries .",
    "there is the need for opacity sampled stellar atmospheres which allow for arbitrary , perhaps even vertically stratified , elemental abundances .",
    "the spectra of spotted stars have to be calculated using at least 2 different atmospheric models ( for a single spot ) but more flexible and realistic abundance patterns may have to make use of many more model atmospheres , up to 10 and even more . finally it is useful to be able to verify how ( zeeman ) doppler maps reflect or fail to reflect any spotted structure adopted in the synthesis of stokes profiles of magnetic stars .",
    "all but one of the codes used in our investigation are based on cossam which stands for `` * co*dice per la * s*intesi * s*pettrale nelle * a*tmosfere * m*agnetiche '' described herewith .",
    "parts of cossam can be traced back to adrs3 ( chmielewski 1979 ) which itself is an evolved version of the fortran adaptation by peytremann et al .",
    "( 1967 ) of the algol60 code analyse65 by baschek et al .",
    "cossam and all the other codes are written in ada , an object - oriented language whose syntax derives from the algol family of languages and which is used mainly for safety - critical applications such as flight software but is also eminently suitable for scientific computing .",
    "ada makes it possible to achieve a remarkably high degree of portability , its encapsulated software modules ( `` packages '' ) allow extensive verbatim software reuse , and there are unique language constructs ( `` tasks '' ) for concurrent processing which can be employed for highly efficient parallel computing with very little synchronisation overhead thanks to `` protected types '' .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that free ada compilers of the same quality as those provided for eads or boeing are provided free of charge and are included in every linux distribution . for more details",
    "see stift ( 1998 , 2000 ) and wade et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "cossam is a code that calculates full stokes  @xmath3 profiles in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) either for the solar case ( at a given point on the solar surface ) or for the stellar case ( integral over the visible hemisphere ) .",
    "atomic transition data are usually taken from the vald database ( piskunov et al .",
    "1995 , kupka et al . 1999 ) , and often include the constants for radiation damping , stark broadening and van der waals broadening . when these constants are unavailable , classical radiation damping and unsld van der waals broadening are taken , together with stark broadening according to gonzalez et al .",
    "for the voigt and faraday profiles of the metal lines the complex rational function given by hui et al .",
    "( 1978 ) is used ; the hydrogen line profiles are calculated by means of the approximation found in tlusty ( hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "zeeman splittings are calculated from the j - values of the lower and upper energy levels respectively and their land factors ; in case these data are lacking , a simple zeeman triplet is assumed . in order to establish the line absorption matrix in the polarised radiative transfer equation ,",
    "full opacity sampling is carried out , separately for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 components .",
    "the required continuous opacities come from the atlas12 ( kurucz 2005 ) routines translated to ada and encapsulated in a reusable multi - purpose package .",
    "special care is applied to the treatment of the lyman , balmer and paschen discontinuities according to the level dissolution probability method of hubeny et al .",
    "the formal solution to the polarised rte is carried out using the zeeman feautrier method ( auer et al .",
    "1977 , alecian & stift 2004 ) or the delo method ( rees et al .",
    "spatial integration of the local stokes profiles over the visible hemisphere can take advantage of an optimum grid due to stift ( 1985 ) .",
    "opacity sampling , the most time - consuming part of the code , is entirely and efficiently parallelised and so allows one to take full advantage of the power of modern symmetric multi - processing ( smp ) machines of 1 - 48 cores and more , all of this without having recourse to mpi or to related software libraries .",
    "cossamspot is a code derived from cossam that calculates full stokes  @xmath3 profiles for stars doted with as many as 10 spots .",
    "as we shall show below , atomic transition data have to be accommodated not just for 1 atmosphere but for up to 10 atmospheres ( or even more ) .",
    "thanks to the object - orientation of ada this can be done in a straightforward way through the use of _ generic packages _ which constitute _ templates _ ( in the c++ diction ) that can be _ instantiated _ with actual parameters .",
    "it thus becomes possible to model e.g. the spectrum of a star with a number of spots each of which is made up of concentric rings of different abundance and/or temperature .",
    "clearly , spotted stars require a grid that is different from the observer - centred grid used in cossam : here we have a co - rotating grid where the whole surface of the star is split into elements of about equal area ( for a typical such grid see e.g. figure  1 in vogt et al .",
    "1987 ) .    for the stellar atmosphere models we rely on the atlas12 code ( kurucz 2005 ) , translated to ada by bischof ( 2005 ) and offering a restricted number of kurucz s original options ; the code has subsequently been thoroughly debugged by stift and now offers most of the original options .",
    "atlasada makes provisions for stratified atmospheres and thanks to the parallelisation of the opacity sampling part , can provide excellent frequency resolution .",
    "apart from these 2 improvements and from better defined interfaces to the subprograms , the input physics are identical to those of the official fortran version .",
    "finally , the doppler mapping code by stift ( 1996 ) has been completely rewritten and is now based on the latest version of cossam . at the time of writing , cossamdoppler derives abundance maps from stokes  @xmath0 profiles only ; the magnetic field geometry is taken into account but has  for our tests  to be the same as the input geometry to cossamspot .",
    "maximum entropy regularisation is combined with a simple gradient search , ensuring convergence to the desired high - quality fit to the intensity profile within 6 - 10 iterations in favourable circumstances .",
    "the repercussions of line blanketing on the structure of a stellar atmosphere were treated in an analytical way by chandrasekhar ( 1935 ) .",
    "his so - called picket - fence model is based on the assumptions of a frequency - independent continuum opacity , of lines distributed randomly and uniformly over the spectrum , and of a constant opacity ratio between the lines ( with square profiles ) and the continuum  for a very readable presentation of this method see mihalas ( 1970 ) .",
    "chandrasekhar showed that with increasing line opacity , the temperature gradient increases , and the temperature at the upper boundary of the atmosphere decreases . later numerical approaches allowed for more realistic spectral line distributions , starting with 30000 lines for procyon ( strom & kurucz 1966 ) and going up to millions of lines ( kurucz & bell 1995 ) ; they give a very detailed idea of how important line blocking and backwarming can become and how these affect the structure of a stellar atmosphere .",
    "k , @xmath20 and varying iron abundances . for all other elements ,",
    "solar abundances have been assumed .",
    "means of the specific intensity at the centre of the disk ( in ergs@xmath26s@xmath27hz@xmath27sr@xmath27 ) have been calculated over 8 intervals .",
    "the curves pertain  from bottom to top  to @xmath28.,width=317 ]    chandrasekhar s picket - fence model is an astrophysical classic but nobody seems to have spent much thought on it in the context of zdm .",
    "so let us investigate what fully line - blanketed atmospheres calculated with atlas12 ( kurucz 2005 ) look like for the extreme abundances , especially of iron , claimed by k10 for @xmath14cvn .",
    "for this purpose we have established a grid of models with @xmath19k , @xmath20 , and with iron abundances that cover a wide range , viz . @xmath29 and @xmath22 ( on a scale where the hydrogen abundance is 12.00 ) .",
    "for simplicity s sake we took solar abundances for all the other elements , allowing us to single out the effects of just 1 parameter .",
    "convergence of the models with large over - abundances turned out to be excruciatingly slow at times and it also proved necessary to proceed in small steps from @xmath30 to @xmath31 and beyond in order to obtain any convergence at all . thanks to the parallelised ada version of atlas12 we could afford satisfactory sampling with 120000 frequency points .",
    "fig.[atmos ] clearly illustrates how the temperature gradient steepens with increasing metallicity , and how at @xmath32 , the bottom of the atmosphere gets hotter whereas the top at @xmath33 becomes cooler , at least up to moderate metallicities .",
    "let us point out that the differences between the curves for @xmath21 and @xmath34 are smaller than the differences between the curves for @xmath31 and @xmath35 ! in order to illustrate the vast changes in line blocking between @xmath23 and @xmath36 over the interval covered by the metal lines used in k10 we plot in fig.[blanket ] stokes@xmath0 specific intensity means over 8 intervals .",
    "at these wavelengths , the continuum of the @xmath36 atmosphere lies considerably above the continuum of the @xmath23 atmosphere in order to ensure constant total flux for the given effective temperature in the presence of heavy blanketing .",
    "note the nice depression around 5200 which develops for @xmath37 and which is probably related to the well known feature used to define a peculiarity index ( maitzen 1976 ) .",
    "given the large differences in atmospheric structure , can we expect spectral line shapes to be insensitive to metallicity effects ?",
    "notwithstanding the ground - breaking work of chandrasekhar ( 1935 ) , differential line - blanketing  between spot and photosphere  in stellar atmospheres has never been taken into account by doppler mapping experts . especially for recent work this seems a bit strange since khan & shulyak ( 2007 ) have shown the non - negligible effects of fe and cr over - abundances on stellar atmospheres and on abundance estimates .",
    "true , for very small abundance differences over the stellar surface it is absolutely tolerable to approximate the `` local atmospheres '' by an atmosphere corresponding to the mean metallicity ( but see below for the definition of `` very small '' ) .",
    "however , in the light of the findings of khan & shulyak ( 2007 ) it is certainly time to challenge this mean atmosphere assumption in those cases when iron abundances attain and exceed @xmath38 , and to show that line profiles calculated with the corresponding high - metallicity atmospheres differ significantly from those calculated for example with a @xmath23 or even a @xmath39 atmosphere .",
    "profile of the feii line at 4923.927 .",
    "the plots give , for a number of iron abundances @xmath40 , the differences @xmath41 at the centre of the stellar disk ; the subscript denotes the iron abundance assumed in the establishment of the stellar atmosphere later used for the spectral synthesis , the superscript the actual iron abundance adopted .",
    "both the non - magnetic case ( lower panel ) and the magnetic case ( upper panel ) with field strength 4400 g and @xmath42 angle between field vector and line - of - sight are shown .",
    "the model atmospheres are the same as presented in fig.[blanket].,width=317 ]    for this purpose , fig.[shape ] displays , for the @xmath434924 iron line ( plus actual blending lines ) at the centre of the stellar disk , normalised intensity differences @xmath41 for various adopted fe abundances @xmath40 .",
    "the subscript stands for the iron abundance adopted in the establishment of the stellar atmosphere , the superscript for the actual iron abundance assumed for the spectral synthesis .",
    "the abundance grid for this test covered @xmath28 . in the lower panel",
    "we plot the non - magnetic intensity differences , in the upper panel the differences for a 4400 g field inclined by @xmath42 with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "for @xmath31 the differences attain about 5% of the continuum both in the non - magnetic and in the magnetic case , and they get substantially larger ( more than 10% ) with increasing iron abundance . in view of these results",
    "it is difficult to understand how k10 ( in section3 ) can come to the conclusion that _ `` the local line profiles are sensitive to model structure effects to a much smaller degree than to changes of abundance or magnetic field''_. it also emerges from these plots that for ultra - high abundances , it becomes more or less impossible to correctly model the line core .",
    "the atlas12 atmospheres  for good reasons  do not go further outward than about @xmath44 and this turns out to be no longer sufficient for extremely strong lines . while this problem hardly shows up when using a @xmath39 atmosphere",
    ", it becomes an object of preoccupation with the correct atmospheric models .",
    "the whole problem with the adoption of a single atmospheric model for the mapping of spotted stars with large differences in abundances over the surface boils down to the inequality + @xmath45 + @xmath46 + where @xmath0 stands for the line intensity , @xmath47 for the continuum intensity . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the fractions of the visible surface taken by spot and remaining atmosphere respectively , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the respective abundances inside and outside the spot .",
    "the left - hand side corresponds to the approximation used in all previous zdm work , whereas the right - hand side gives the correct formula for the observed normalised intensity .",
    "it comes as no surprise that the consequences of not taking into account the metallicity - dependent line shapes and absolute line intensities can be quite serious as we shall demonstrate further in the following sections .",
    "and @xmath1 profiles of the feii line at 4923.927 of a rotating star with a single spot , calculated with the correct ( 2 ) model atmospheres for the star and its spot on the one hand , with a mean model for star and spot on the other hand .",
    "the plot shows the normalised differences for 5 phases ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) in the sense mean minus correct .",
    "a spot of @xmath57 radius is situated at a latitude of @xmath58 and displays a 1.5dex over - abundance of iron with respect to the @xmath39 abundance over the rest of the star .",
    "the inclination of the star is @xmath59 , the respective magnetic field extrema are 1500 g and 5500 g . at @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    "the spot is near the limb , at @xmath62 it is almost centred.,width=317 ]",
    "what can we learn from the plots given in the section above as far as the determination of abundances is concerned ?",
    "extreme fe abundances in localised spots as claimed by k10 for @xmath14cvn  there would be 3 iron atoms for every 100 hydrogen atoms  seem a bit unrealistic but are no obstacle to modelling with atlas12 and with cossam .",
    "we have calculated the full stokes parameters of a spotted star with @xmath63kms@xmath27 , inclination @xmath64 , and covered by a large spot of @xmath57 radius at @xmath58 latitude . for the spot we adopted @xmath31 , for the remaining part of the star @xmath39 .",
    "one set of spectra was calculated with a @xmath39 atmosphere throughout , the other set is based on the actual value , @xmath31 , inside the spot .",
    "the lower panel of fig.[stokes - iv ] displays  for 5 different rotational phases  the differences between the normalised stokes  @xmath0 spectrum obtained with the same atmosphere all over the star ( as done by k02/k10 and henceforth denoted as the `` usual '' spectrum ) and the correct spectrum . these differences with a maximum of about 7%",
    " which can by no means be considered small or negligible in view of a central line intensity of about 40% of the continuum  change their positions with phase due to the rotation . in a zdm calculation , based on the `` usual '' global atmospheric model , this would translate to appropriately placed spurious over - abundances , a problem which we shall discuss later in more detail .",
    "the upper panel of fig.[stokes - iv ] reveals that polarisation is affected too .",
    "the tilted and eccentric dipole model adopted leads to respective minimum and maximum field strengths of 1500 and 5500gauss .",

    "if , as shown above , the shapes of iron lines change with the metallicity of the stellar atmosphere , what will happen to the balmer lines in a spotted star and to the stellar parameters derived from them ?",
    "we have tried to figure this out at least partially by calculating phase - dependent spectra for a star with 8 abundance regions representing 6 different iron abundances .",
    "the results are shown for 4 phases in fig.[beta ] , together with the corresponding abundance distributions over the visible stellar hemisphere .",

    "the outer wings turn out to change by less than 1% at wavelengths more than 10 distant from the line centre .",

    "units are % of the continuum or % polarisation .",
    "the panels to the right display profiles relative to those of a star with no field enhancement in the spot , convolved to the resolution of the k10 spectra . note the difference in scale !",
    ", width=317 ]    before embarking on the numerical modelling of the signal of a high - contrast magnetic spot , let us shortly dwell on just 2 appropriate observational considerations",
    ". looking at figure  7 in k10 , it appears that a feature as small as @xmath68 is resolved which in terms of spherical harmonics would correspond to @xmath69 .",
    "however , at the same time figure  12 in k10 goes no further than @xmath70 with hardly any power left in this moderately high harmonic .",
    "this raises first doubts as to the actual detectability of small - scale structures , doubts which are not dispelled when rotational doppler shifts are related to the resolution of the musicos spectrograph on the pic - du - midi used by k10 .",
    "the rather moderate resolution of the spectra , viz .",
    "r = 35000 , translates to @xmath71 fwhm for the iron lines used by k10 .",
    "if one takes a spot of @xmath68 diameter whose leading edge is exactly on the limb and the trailing edge thus @xmath72 from the line of sight , in terms of doppler shift the difference in wavelength between leading and trailing edge is a mere 0.018 , corresponding to 1/8 of the resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "there can thus be hardly any doubt that the signal of a small - scale magnetic spot  even when the contrast to the surroundings is high  will be exceedingly faint and washed out due to the limited resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "the question immediately arises whether such hypothetical spots are observable at all - remember that they tend to appear and to disappear with the regularisation parameter - given that any error in the assumed atmospheric model translates to erroneous synthetic stokes profiles on which abundance and magnetic field estimates are based .    we have for simplicity s sake assumed a centred dipole oblique rotator model with @xmath42 obliquity , seen equator - on , a polar field strength of 4.0 kg , and a spot of @xmath68 diameter ( indeed a small - scale structure ) at @xmath73 latitude",
    ". based on this geometry , we then established 2 phase - dependent sets of stokes spectra with an iron abundance of @xmath31 in the spot , and with @xmath39 over the rest of the stellar surface .",

    "zeeman doppler mapping addicts will find the maximum differential signal in stokes@xmath4 from a spot in which the magnetic field is increased from 2 kg to 3 kg disappointingly low , viz . a mere 0.10% for the correct model , barely 0.07% for the `` usual '' model .",
    "the situation is almost identical in stokes@xmath1 .",
    "even a staggering field increase in the spot from 2 kg to 4 kg is reflected in no more than a 0.22% differential signal in stokes@xmath4 and @xmath1 , 0.15% for the `` usual '' model .",
    "note that these differential signals are not only disturbingly small but that figure  5 of k10 shows quite a few @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 profiles which are not fitted to that accuracy !    even at almost infinite resolution  left side panels of fig.[fine ]  a 50% increase in field strength in the high - abundance spot adds at most 0.22% to the stokes @xmath4 signal , and 0.18% to the @xmath1 signal , taking the correct 2 atmospheric models .",
    "here we have plotted the stokes profiles relative to a reference spectrum calculated for a homogeneous iron abundance of @xmath39 over the entire star , in order to reveal the following profoundly worrisome fact : adopting the `` usual '' approach to the modelling of spotted stars leads to errors in all 4 stokes parameters .",
    "this is particularly well visible in stokes  @xmath0 , resulting in spurious abundance estimates , but stokes  @xmath4 and @xmath1 too turn out to be seriously affected , giving magnetic field estimates in error by more than 30% !",
    "looking for example just at the stokes @xmath1 signal , the `` usual '' curve for a 4 kg field inside the spot is almost indistinguishable from the correct curve for a 3 kg field",
    ". put it the other way round , one would considerably overestimate both magnetic field strength and abundance in the spot using the `` usual '' incorrect mean model approach .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that one can not beat the limited resolution of a spectrograph by using stokes @xmath4 and @xmath5 profiles in order to obtain magnetic maps at ultra - high resolution it also becomes obvious that any reliable abundance and/or magnetic field estimates depend on the use of the correct atmospheric models for the spotted stellar surface .",
    "when these prerequisites of sufficient resolution and appropriate atmospheric models are not met , how then can one credibly establish secondary maxima or exceedingly small minima , in particular in places where the magnetic field strength drops from about 1 kg to a few hundred gauss ?",
    "the observed stokes  @xmath0 profile of a rotating star is given by the integral over the properly doppler - shifted local line and continuum intensities .",
    "a spot with enhanced abundances normally shows up as a bump , a dip , or an asymmetry of the profile that varies with rotational phase . in doppler mapping",
    "this intensity information as a function of wavelength is used for the reconstruction of the surface abundance distribution , translating each wavelength difference ( relative to the line centre ) to a velocity swath on the stellar disk .",
    "as it turns out , this inversion is highly vulnerable to errors in the assumed atmospheric model .",
    ".,width=317 ]    to illustrate this point , we consider the profile differences presented in fig.[stokes - iv ] .",
    "the largest deviation in stokes  @xmath0 is found near 4923.78 , about 9kms@xmath27 from the unshifted line position .",
    "this means that halfway from the disk centre to the limb , we get an estimate of the intensity which is incorrect by about 15% when using the `` usual '' model . in stokes  @xmath1 the errors can become even larger , up to 30% for the dash - dotted red curve near 4923.65 . of course such differences",
    "can not be converted directly to abundance or field corrections in some region of the stellar surface because doppler mapping involves global optimisation involving a regularisation function .",
    "quite some time ago , stift ( 1996 ) has pointed out that _ `` spurious abundances ... constitute the sometimes entirely unphysical response of a particular regularisation function to the spectral signature of the magnetic field '' _ but it is clear that the same holds true for errors in the atmospheric structure of a spotted star .",
    "profiles of the feii line at 4923.927 .",
    "synthetic profiles taken for input have been calculated for a star covered by 3 spots as shown in fig.[field ] ; the iron abundance is up to @xmath30 in the spots and @xmath23 in the remaining atmosphere .",
    "one set of profiles is based on the correct atmospheric models , the other set on the `` usual '' approach with a mean model of @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is employed in both inversions which lead to the maps shown in the respective lower ( `` usual '' profiles ) and upper ( correct profiles ) panels.,width=317 ]    let us demonstrate the validity of our argument with actual doppler maps . using the revived and refined doppler mapping code of stift ( 1996 ) ,",
    "we have inverted a series of stokes  @xmath0 profiles corresponding in resolution , wavelength coverage and number of phases to the profiles used by k10 .",
    "the star is inclined by @xmath74 and covered by 3 spots as shown in fig.[field ] ; it rotates at @xmath63kms@xmath27 , and the absolute strength of the dipolar magnetic field ranges from 2 kg to 4 kg . inside the spots the abundance can be as high as @xmath30 , outside it is @xmath23 .",
    "the `` usual '' intensity profiles have been calculated with a @xmath34 atmosphere , the correct profiles with the appropriate @xmath75 and @xmath76 atmospheres .",
    "the inversion of a single line as in kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) leads to the results shown in fig.[maps ] .",
    "the lower panel shows an equal - area hammer projection of the map obtained with the `` usual '' profiles and the `` usual '' doppler mapping approach , viz . under the assumption of a mean atmosphere inside and outside the spot , in this case a @xmath34 atmosphere . in the upper panel",
    "we have inverted the correct profiles in exactly the same `` usual '' way .",
    "both inversions result in a comparable quality of the fit to the input profiles , both inversions display respective abundance maps that do not look unreasonable at all .",
    "it is obvious that the top part of fig.[maps ] does not resemble the bottom part of fig.[field ] , but we wo nt dwell here on the problem of finding the true extensions of spots , their contrast and number ( for this see e.g. khokhlova 1976 , goncharskii et al . 1982 ) . we rather want to concentrate on pointing out the mapping errors introduced by the differences between the metallicity assumed for the `` usual '' inversion and the actual metallicities in the spotted star .",
    "note the conspicuously different respective extensions of the main spot and the spurious structure showing up in several places .     but displaying the difference ( dex ) between the respective abundance maps in the sense `` correct '' minus `` usual '' line spectrum.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ] [ discrep ]    to make it clear how serious the problem facing doppler mapping really is , we plot the difference between the map obtained with the correct profiles and the `` usual '' map . as revealed in fig.[discrep",
    "] , the differences between the respective abundances go from -0.5dex to almost + 0.7dex , a remarkably large range given the relatively small error in the assumed abundance of the stellar atmosphere over most of the stellar surface . note the spurious gradients near the borders of the actual strong spot .",
    "it is not easy to assess which of our findings will have the most sobering effect on ( zeeman ) doppler mapping enthusiasts keen on claiming to have found small - scale and high - contrast structure on the surfaces of magnetic ap stars .",
    "what we would certainly consider most disturbing is the fact that despite the use of high s / n ratio full stokes  @xmath3 spectra , zeeman doppler mapping with tikhonov regularisation as carried out for example by k02 and k10 can lead to abundance distributions and magnetic field maps that are demonstrably and unequivocally incorrect .",
    "this singularly strong statement is justified by the following considerations : the far - reaching claims by k10 are not based on tolerable approximations to the atmospheric structure of spotted stars since k10 not only neglect well - established physics of stellar atmospheres explored decades ago by chandrasekhar ( 1935 ) , but they also discard among others recent well - founded findings and recommendations made by khan & shulyak ( 2007 ) . there can be no doubt that complex zeeman doppler maps with high - contrast abundance distributions and small - scale magnetic features can by no means be correct when local stokes@xmath0 profiles are in error by as much as 10% of the continuum and when field estimates based on local stokes@xmath4 and @xmath1 profiles are in error by 30% and more .",
    "the fate of the k10 paper is shared by a number of similar analyses ( see e.g. lftinger et al .",
    "2010 ) . having been made to believe that full stokes profiles provide sufficient information not only to map 2-d abundance and magnetic field distributions but also 3-d abundance stratifications ( lftinger et al .",
    "2008 , but see stift & alecian 2009 ) we were rather surprised to see that excellent zdm codes like invers10 used by k10 can yield good fits to the observed stokes  @xmath3 profiles even when the adopted local line profiles are grossly in error .",
    "the results shown in fig.[discrep ] were equally surprising since they reveal that the adoption of an atmospheric model of mean metallicity in the doppler mapping procedure  the respective correct models for the star and its spots differ by at most @xmath77dex from this mean model",
    " leads to local abundance discrepancies of between @xmath78dex and @xmath79dex .",
    "considering the fact that at @xmath34 metallicity effects are still relatively small and that they increase drastically for @xmath80 ( see fig.[atmos ] and fig.[blanket ] ) , we are not overly optimistic as e.g. to the reliability of the iron distribution derived by k10 , where the adopted atmosphere with @xmath39 differs from the `` local '' atmospheres by as much as 2dex .",
    "let us also dwell a bit on a previously unnoticed , but not altogether surprising , complication that must be taken into account when applying zdm .",
    "the adoption of a mean atmosphere for a spotted star will not only lead to erroneous surface abundance patterns but also to incorrect magnetic geometries .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the stokes @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath1 profiles suffer considerably from metallicity related effects ; the adoption of a mean atmosphere for a spotted star can induce spurious changes of about 30% and more in the maximum polarisation signal .",
    "these wavelength- and phase - dependent profile changes will necessarily translate to errors in the distribution of magnetic field strength and direction .",
    "given all the systematic errors in the 4 stokes parameters which result from the use of a mean atmosphere , it could then prove premature to combine abundance and magnetic maps in an effort to verify how these data match theoretical predictions from the diffusion model ( michaud 1970 ) or to correlate the radial field field and abundance distributions of various elements as done by k02 .",
    "even less surprisingly , it is shown that the existence of  small - scale magnetic structures \" and of `` high - contrast magnetic spots '' can not at present be ascertained at any acceptable level of confidence .",
    "even apparently moderate errors in the assumed atmosphere model can lead to non - negligible errors in the inferred magnetic field of a small , high - contrast spot .",
    "any reliable detection of such a magnetic spot would only be possible with a much higher spectral resolution than available to k02 or k10 , and it would require a fit to the stokes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath1 profiles to at least @xmath81% .",
    "one should therefore consider magnetic fine structure as for example shown in figure7 of k10 to be largely an artefact of regularisation .    in view of our results , the outlook for zdm is a bit bleak but not hopeless .",
    "success in the quest for more reliable maps of cp stars depends on the ability to eschew the use of a mean atmosphere , replacing it with a whole grid of stellar atmospheres with different abundances of all the elements important enough to influence the temperature structure of the atmosphere ( see again khan & shulyak 2007 ) .",
    "as experience with cossamspot shows this might put serious strain on computing resources but there is no way around it . in return , abundance maps based on the correct atmosphere models might exhibit less spectacular amplitudes and the contrast might diminish , reducing the complexity of the computations .",
    "it is clear that zdm is still in its infancy but multi - core computer architectures in combination with modern object - oriented programming paradigms and powerful compilers will make it possible to enter the next phase .",
    "keep however in mind that this approach is still full of ( it is hoped ) acceptable approximations and that more difficulties are lurking behind the bend : the influence of magnetic fields on the atmospheric structure , stratification , 2d and 3d stellar atmospheres for latitude- and longitude - dependent stratifications , etc .",
