    "large systems of molecular liquids are characterized by processes occurring at different scales which in turn often require a different level of accuracy regarding the molecular model @xcite .",
    "highly accurate molecular models lead to a complete physical picture but require large computational resources and additional work of analysis of the large amount of data produced ; in fact a clear description of a process requires a screening of data to the essential .",
    "on the other hand , less accurate molecular models are computationally convenient and produce a small amount of data to analyze , however they are likely to miss , due to their simplification , essential physical features @xcite . in this perspective , multiscale methods in molecular simulation ( ms ) have been developed in the last years for optimizing the need of a consistent physical treatment and acceptable numerical and analysis costs @xcite .",
    "in particular adaptive molecular resolution methods , which by partitioning the system in regions of different molecular resolution , change the number of degrees of freedom on - the - fly became very appealing due to successful numerical performance @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the basic principles employed in the construction of adaptive resolution schemes .",
    "the schemes can be classified in two major categories : ( a ) force - based interpolation schemes @xcite ; ( b ) potential - based ( hamiltonian - based ) schemes @xcite .",
    "the adaptive resolution simulation ( adress ) method has been developed following a simple intuitive principle .",
    "such a principle consists of dividing the space in three distinct regions : ( i ) atomistic region ( high resolution ) , ( ii ) coarse - grained region ( low resolution ) , ( iii ) interface or hybrid / transition region where molecules change their resolution .",
    "next the intuitive physical requirement is that the molecules of the atomistic region follow the rules of a standard atomistic dynamics , the molecules of the coarse - grained region follow the rules of a standard coarse - grained dynamics and when a molecule transits in the interface region its dynamics slowly passes from atomistic type to a coarse - grained type ( or vice versa ) , the meaning of `` slowly '' is that the perturbation due to the change of resolution to the dynamics of the atomistic and of the coarse - grained region is negligible in the calculations of physical quantities of interest . in molecular dynamics ( md )",
    "such a principle can be easily implemented by smoothly interpolating in space the atomistic and coarse - grained forces : @xmath0{{\\textbf{\\textit{f}}}}^{cg}_{i , j }   \\label{eqforce}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the indices of two distinct molecules , @xmath3 is the force derived from the atomistic potential ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 is the force derived from the coarse - grained potential ( @xmath6 ) ( usually a com - com potential , where com indicates `` the center of mass '' ) , @xmath7 is the com position of the molecule and @xmath8 is a smooth function varying from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in the transition region ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12    & x_{at } < x < x_{at}+d\\\\                 0 & x_{at } + d < x             \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 the x - location of the border of the at region ( see fig.[system - setup ] ) .        in an effective way ,",
    "the atomistic degrees of freedom are slowly removed when a molecule leaves the atomistic region and enters into the coarse - grained region and vice versa . as it is described above , the scheme is dissipative , that is the change in number of degrees of freedom implies a gain or loss of kinetic and potential energy which is not spontaneously balanced , and in fact the system , prepared following this scheme , is not hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , when coupled to a an external thermostat , which takes care of adsorbing the excess or adding the missing energy , it was proven to be technically sufficient for the scheme to work properly @xcite . at a later stage",
    "this empirical finding was justified on the basis of first principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics and recently the basic scheme reported above was embedded into the formalism of a grand canonical ensemble where the coarse - grained and transition region act as a particle reservoir for the atomistic region @xcite .",
    "the technical details are not relevant for this paper , except that in a grand canonical - like set up , the reservoir acts in a stochastic way and thus the only hamiltonian of relevance is that of the atomistic region which implies that the non - existence of a global hamiltonian is no more a problem .",
    "however , some branches of research followed a different path based on the search of a global hamiltonian without the addition of any stochastic aspect .",
    "an overview of the progress and pitfalls of such approaches is reported below .      in a series of papers ensing and collaborators @xcite presented a scheme based on the interpolation of potentials instead of forces as done in adress : @xmath14u^{cg}_{i , j } \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the global potential of interaction between molecule @xmath1 and molecule @xmath2",
    ", @xmath16 is the smooth interpolation function ( slightly but not substantially different from the function @xmath17 used in adress ) and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the atomistic and coarse - grained potential acting between molecule @xmath1 and molecule @xmath2 .",
    "if , from @xmath20 one derives the force between molecule @xmath1 and molecule @xmath2 then the result is a force as that of adress plus an additional term : @xmath21 . in their work of molecules that change resolution and thus adding at each instant the gain / loss of energy due to the change of resolution and",
    "preserve a global hamiltonian approach .",
    "in fact , in essence , the system was coupled to a generic external thermostat and thus this method became equivalent to the force - based adress scheme .",
    "it was then shown that without the thermostat the system was highly dissipative and that the interpolation of potentials plus the book - keeping energy was not sufficient to build a conservative scheme @xcite .",
    "however , later on , the idea of providing / removing energy without using a thermostat was technically implemented by a method named `` h - adress '' developed by potestio and collaborators @xcite . in h - adress the interpolation is also done as in eq.[ham ] and it was observed that such an interpolation is equivalent to the scheme of thermodynamic integration for the calculation of the difference of free energy between a state a and a state b of the system . in this case state a and state b meant the passage from the atomistic potential to the coarse - grained potential and thus the interpolation formula is equivalent to the space dependent change of free energy between the atomistic and the coarse - grained representation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 indicates the ensemble average and each @xmath24 corresponds to fixed values of the switching function @xmath8 in the transition region , thus @xmath25 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian was _ a posteriori _ modified so that the balancing term of free energy , @xmath26 was added in an effective hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that there is no need of a generic and undefined book - keeping of the molecular energy , but the missing energy can be quantified by @xmath26 .",
    "there are at least three arguments for this thesis : ( i ) the scheme violates third newton s law , in fact the force term : @xmath27 is not antisymmetric in @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite ; ( ii ) the hamiltonian is ill defined because any additional / corrective one particle potential , like @xmath28 , must be a solution of a partial differential equation of the first order but with two boundary conditions @xcite ; ( iii ) the effective hamiltonian is not a first principles hamiltonian but , by construction , depends on the specific thermodynamic state point ( in fact it carries a free energy term : @xmath28 ) @xcite . in this perspective the search for a first principle ( self - contained ) hamiltonian that allows for a change of resolution without the need of _ a priori _ or _ a posteriori _ ( artificial ) corrections , motivated us to explore new directions , as reported in the next section .",
    "table.[tab3 ] is a list of symbols and labels used in this section for future reference :    [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    table [ tab2 ] reports results about some representative examples of systems that we have studied by sampling the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) space .",
    "systems of smaller size ( i.e. with less than 12000 molecules ) are not reported because they do not meet neither the mathematical nor the ( intuitive / practical ) physical conditions for being hamiltonian .",
    "instead the systems reported in table [ tab2 ] are in principle all possible candidates for being hamiltonian systems , however , some meet the conditions better than others . in general , some systems , , have shown a clear hamiltonian nature , they are characterized by a relatively large hy region and thus the condition : @xmath33 is satisfactorily met and the cg region is large enough to provide thermodynamic stability to the rest of the system .",
    "fig.[temph2 ] show the temperature as a function of time compared with the equivalent full atomistic nve simulation for system ( f ) , taken as representative example ; the agreement is remarkable ( if the system was dissipative the temperature would show a sizeable drift compared to the reference full atomistic simulation ) . as discussed before , fig.[temph2 ] is not sufficient to justify the claim that the hamiltonian of the system is a `` proper '' adaptive hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , it may well be that while the system preserves the temperature in a proper way , other properties are instead modified in such a way that they do not reproduce the properties of the reference full atomistic system ( or full coarse - grained system ) .",
    "for this reason we studied two important structural properties , that is the molecular number density and the radial distribution functions , c - c , c - h and h - h in the atomistic region ; here we report the result for the most critical case that is for system @xmath34 .",
    "fig.[rho1 ] shows for the system @xmath34 the density across the box after @xmath35 .",
    "after such time if the system did not behave properly it should display large deviations from the reference nve results .",
    "the density profile agrees with the reference one , with differences , in the most unfavorable case , of about @xmath36 in the region of maximal perturbation , that is in the hy region , however in the rest of the system the differences are below @xmath37 which is highly satisfactory",
    ". moreover fig.[gofr ] shows that the atomistic radial distribution functions of the adaptive systems essentially overlap with those of the reference full atomistic system .",
    "other systems reported in table [ tab2 ] and characterized as `` @xmath38 '' show the same accuracy of system . [ beyond ]                on the basis of this result we can claim that we have found several systems where the adaptive set up corresponds closely to a self - contained hamiltonian which produces highly satisfactory results on time windows of at least ps . as said before the time window considered is the same as that used in other adaptive work to calculate static properties of the full atomistic region .",
    "instead systems @xmath39 and @xmath40 do not produce satisfactory results ; in system @xmath39 the transition region is very small and thus it strongly violates the mathematical condition of @xmath8 being slowly varying .",
    "in fact despite the fact that the dissipation produced by the sharp transition can be mostly adsorbed by the large at and very large cg region , the dissipation of energy is clearly visible in the plot of the temperature as a function of time ( see fig.[h / d ] ) .",
    "finally for system @xmath40 we have a smaller at and cg region than for system @xmath39 ; this , together with the small size of the hy region , makes the system highly dissipative as reported in fig.[d ] .",
    "system @xmath41 instead , although it has got a relatively large hy region , is characterized by a cg region which is too small to act as equilibrating reservoir .",
