    "recent observations of galaxies at intermediate redshift ( @xmath5 ) have identified a significant population of massive ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) , quiescent , early - type systems with old , metal - rich stellar populations and remarkably small sizes relative to their local counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "altogether , the observations suggest that there is significant evolution in the size of massive ellipticals over the past @xmath13 gyr , likely proceeding in an inside - out manner , without the addition of much stellar mass .",
    "several physical processes have been proposed to explain this strong size evolution within the massive , early - type population at @xmath4 . in particular , gas - poor , collisionless ( or `` dry '' ) minor mergers are often invoked as a means for puffing up the stellar component of these massive systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one way to possibly discriminate between these scenarios ( minor mergers versus secular processes ) is by quantifying the role of environment in the structural evolution of the massive galaxy population .",
    "while secular processes are largely independent of environment and quasars are not preferentially found in overdense regions at @xmath14 @xcite , mergers are more common in higher - density environments such as galaxy groups @xcite .",

    "however , over this somewhat broad redshift range the sample is incomplete at the adopted mass limit .",
    "for example , at @xmath83 the @xmath84 magnitude limit of deep2 includes all galaxies with stellar mass @xmath85 independent of color , but preferentially misses red galaxies at lower masses ( see fig.[fig_cmdz ] ) .",
    "this incompleteness in the galaxy population is addressed in more detail in  [ sec_results ] .",
    "in order to study the relationship between galaxy properties and environment at fixed stellar mass , as we aim to do here , the galaxy sample under study is often restricted to a narrow range in stellar mass such that correlations between stellar mass and environment are negligible . however , at intermediate redshift , sample sizes are generally limited in number such that using a particularly narrow stellar mass range ( e.g. , @xmath86@xmath87 dex in width ) significantly reduces the statistical power of the sample .",
    "for this reason , broader stellar mass bins ( e.g. , @xmath70 dex ) are commonly employed . however ,",
    "if the shape of the stellar mass function depends on environment ( as suggested by @xcite ) , then the typical stellar mass within a broad mass bin may differ significantly from one density regime to another .",
    "such an effect would clearly impact the ability to study the relationship between galaxy size and environment at fixed stellar mass .",
    "for this reason , we instead select those galaxies within the top @xmath88 of the overdensity distribution for all red galaxies at @xmath89 and @xmath55 ( a subsample of @xmath90 galaxies ) , and from the corresponding bottom @xmath91 of the overdensity distribution we randomly draw 1000 subsamples ( each composed of @xmath90 galaxies ) so as to match the joint redshift , stellar mass , and srsic index distributions of the galaxies in the high - density subsample .",
    "the average environment for the high - density subset is @xmath92 , with an interquartile ( 25%75% ) range of @xmath93@xmath94 , while the low - density subsample is biased to considerably less - dense environs with an average overdensity of @xmath95 and an interquartile range of @xmath96@xmath97 .",

    ", we remove the projection of any possible residual correlation between our environment measurements and redshift ( in concert with the known redshift dependence of the survey s stellar - mass limit ) onto the observed size - environment relation .",

    "* ) , we also force the srsic indices of the low - density subsample to match those of the high - density population , which controls for the contribution of dusty disk galaxies to our red - sequence population . matching based on rest - frame color , in lieu of srsic index , would confuse reddened disk galaxies with red early - type systems .",
    "members of the low - density subsample are drawn randomly from within a three - dimensional window with dimensions of @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 of a randomly - selected object in the high - density subsample .",
    "varying the size of this window by factors of a few in each dimension has no significant effect on our results .",
    "given the random nature of the matching , some objects are repeated in the low - density subsamples . however , for each subsample of @xmath90 galaxies , @xmath102 of the galaxies are unique ; requiring all members of a subsample to be unique would skew the statistics @xcite . by matching our high- and low - density subsamples in stellar mass , redshift , as well as srsic index ,",
    "we are able to effectively study the correlation between galaxy size and environment at fixed stellar mass .",
    "to test whether our high - density subsample and the random low - density subsamples are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying stellar mass distribution , we apply two non - parametric ( i.e. , independent of gaussian assumptions ) tests , the two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test @xcite and the one - sided wilcoxon - mann - whitney ( wmw ) @xmath103 test @xcite .",
    "the result of each test is a @xmath104-value : the probability that a value of the ks or @xmath103 statistic equal to the observed value or more extreme would be obtained , if the `` null '' hypothesis holds that the samples are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "the wmw @xmath103 test is computed by ranking all elements of the two data sets together and then comparing the mean ( or total ) of the ranks from each data set .",
    "because it relies on ranks rather than observed values , it is highly robust to non - gaussianity .",
    "the wmw @xmath103 test is particularly useful for small data sets ( e.g. , compared to other related tests such as the chi - square two - sample test , @xcite ) , as we have when selecting galaxies from a narrow stellar mass range and in extreme environments , due to its insensitivity to outlying data points , its avoidance of binning , and its high efficiency .",
    "note that since this test is one - sided , possible @xmath105 values range from @xmath106 to @xmath25 ( versus @xmath107 which ranges from @xmath106 to @xmath10 ) ; for a @xmath105 value below @xmath108 ( corresponding closely to @xmath109 for a gaussian ) , we can reject the null hypothesis ( that the two samples have the same distribution ) at greater than @xmath110 significance .",
    "test is given by doubling the one - sided probability .",
    "here , we report only the one - sided probability . ]    in figure [ fig_cdists ] , we plot the cumulative distribution of stellar masses for the @xmath90 sources in the high - density subsample alongside that for the 1000 random subsamples ( each consisting of @xmath90 galaxies ) matched in redshift but residing in low - density environments . performing a one - sided wmw @xmath103 test ( and a two - sided ks test ) on the size ( @xmath8 ) measurements for the low- and high - density populations , we find that the size distribution for the galaxies in high - density environments is skewed to larger sizes , with a probability of @xmath111 ( and @xmath112 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the cumulative stellar mass , redshift , and srsic index distributions for the low- and high - density subsamples , shown in the inset of figure [ fig_cdists ] , are well - matched with the wmw @xmath103 test yielding a @xmath113 .",
    "this confirms that our sample - construction procedure has yielded sets of galaxies in low- and high - density environments whose redshift , mass , and srsic index distributions match closely .",
    "while not directly matched , the rest - frame color distributions for the two samples are also indistinguishable  not a surprising result given that the color - density relation shows no significant variation across the red sequence at a given luminosity @xcite",
    ". see table [ res_tab1 ] for a complete summary of the probability values given by both the wmw @xmath103 and ks tests .",
    "the results of the wmw @xmath103 test are confirmed by a comparison of the hodges - lehmann ( h - l ) estimator of the mean sizes for the low- and high - density subsamples , which differ by @xmath114 @xmath53 kpc .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that there is a non - negligible size - environment relation on the red sequence at @xmath115 .",
    "the hodges - lehmann ( h - l ) estimator of the mean is given by the median value of the mean computed over all pairs of galaxies in the sample @xcite .",
    "like taking the median of a distribution , the h - l estimator of the mean is robust to outliers , but , unlike the median , yields results with scatter ( in the gaussian case ) comparable to the arithmetic mean .",
    "thus , by using the h - l estimator of the mean , we gain robustness as in the case of the median , but unlike the median , our measurement errors are increased by only a few percent .    in figure [ fig_hlmeans ] , we show the distribution of the differences between the hodges - lehmann estimator of the mean size , stellar mass , redshift , srsic index , and color for the high - density subsample relative to that for each of the @xmath116 low - density subsamples , where the median difference in the h - l estimate of the mean size is @xmath117 ( as illustrated by the dashed vertical line ) versus @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 for stellar mass , redshift , srsic index , and color , respectively ( see table [ res_tab2 ] ) . within the stellar mass range of @xmath122",
    ", we find significant evidence for a correlation between galaxy size and environment at @xmath123 , such that higher - density regions play host to larger galaxies at a given stellar mass on the red sequence .",
    "to test the robustness of our results to the particularities of the sample selection , we repeat the analysis described above for several samples spanning varying redshift and stellar mass regimes . for example , restricting the redshift range over which we select galaxies to @xmath124 , thereby decreasing the size of the sample , we again find a statistically significant relationship between galaxy structure and environment within our adopted stellar mass bin of @xmath89 .",
    "for the @xmath125 galaxies in the high - density regime ( again the highest @xmath88 of the overdensity distribution ) at @xmath124 , the cumulative distribution of galaxy size ( @xmath8 ) is skewed towards larger effective radii relative to the comparison set of galaxies in low - density environments , yielding @xmath111 and a median difference in the h - l estimator of the mean size of @xmath126 @xmath53 kpc .",
    "an obvious concern when studying the structure of galaxies on the red sequence is the relative contribution of early - type systems and dusty disk galaxies to the sample . especially at fainter magnitudes / lower stellar mass ,",
    "reddened star - forming galaxies comprise a significant portion of the red galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and as many studies of environment and clustering at intermediate redshift have shown the star - forming population tends to reside in lower - density regions relative to their passive counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even with our primary sample selected to be at the massive end of the red sequence , disk galaxies ( @xmath127 ) still account for @xmath128 of the population ( see figure [ fig_cdists ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that a difference in the relative contribution of dusty disk galaxies to the high- and low - density populations is driving the observed size - density relation since galaxy size correlates with srsic index such that red disk galaxies ( systems with @xmath127 ) tend to have slightly larger ( not smaller ) measured sizes than red galaxies of slightly larger srsic index .",
    "still , to minimize any potential impact from late - type systems , we define two subsamples : one selected according to @xmath129 and a second further constrained to systems with @xmath129 and with axis ratios , @xmath130 , greater than @xmath131 ( see table [ res_tab1 ] ) . for these subsamples of galaxies with early - type morphology , we find that the correlation between structure and environment persists , reinforcing the conclusion that early - type systems ( and not dusty disk galaxies ) are responsible for the observed size - density relation at fixed stellar mass .    to illustrate the correlation between size and environment in a more physically intuitive manner , in figure [ fig_smrel ] , we show the size - stellar mass relations for early - type galaxies in overdense and underdense regions . in the top portion of fig .",
    "[ fig_smrel ] , the high- and low - density samples are simply defined to be the extreme quartiles of the environment distribution for all galaxies with @xmath132 , @xmath124 , and @xmath133 . in the middle and bottom panel , however , a more controlled comparison is made , with the high - density sample selected as the top @xmath88 of the environment distribution for all galaxies with @xmath129 , @xmath72 , and @xmath133 and the low - density sample is comprised of @xmath134 galaxies randomly drawn from the bottom @xmath91 of the environment distribution to match the @xmath40 distribution ( middle ) and the joint @xmath60 and @xmath40 distribution ( bottom ) of the high - density sample . in agreement with our previous analysis",
