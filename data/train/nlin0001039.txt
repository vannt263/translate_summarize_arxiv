    "in cosmical objects , small - scale evolution of the magnetic field @xmath5 often takes place in the presence of a strong large - scale magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "it is , for example , what happens in the solar corona where , in spite of the typical value of the sun magnetic field ( @xmath7 gauss ) , fields as intense as @xmath8 gauss can be observed in solar flares .",
    "these highly energetic and large - scale events coexist with small - scale turbulent activity , finally responsible of the dissipation of magnetic field energy . modelling the way through which energy is stored and then dissipated is , consequently , not an easy task .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the following description is proposed : a large - scale axial , e.g. , directed parallel to some vector @xmath9 , magnetic field @xmath6 is assumed to dominate the dynamics in the @xmath10 direction , while the activity in the transverse plane can be satisfactorily described as quasi - bidimensional .",
    "this picture allows reliable numerical simulations in two dimensions , from which it appears clear that the magnetic field tends to organize in rare large - scale structures separated by narrow current sheets .",
    "deep investigation of small - scale intermittency properties is still not permitted by lack of spatial resolution .    an interesting question raised by this problem , beside structure formation ,",
    "is related to the role played by large - scale anisotropy on the small - scale statistics .",
    "indeed , this is quite a typical situation in turbulence , where almost every large - scale forcing is not isotropic . here",
    ", instead of taking the restoration of local small - scale isotropy for granted , as in the kolmogorov theory of turbulence @xcite , we analyze in detail the effects of anisotropic large - scale contributions on the small - scale magnetic fluctuations .",
    "a wide interest has been recently devoted to this issue . from the viewpoints of theoretical and numerical analysis , focusing on a small number of indicators",
    "some arguments are given in favor of the small - scale isotropy restoration in the navier  stokes ( ns ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , investigating a larger class of anisotropic indicators , footprints of small - scale anisotropy become manifest @xcite .",
    "the scenario thus appears extremely faceted and needs of further investigations .",
    "recently , clear evidences of persistent small scale anisotropy have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the statistical properties of a scalar field advected by the non - intermittent ns flow generated in a two - dimensional inverse cascade regime are investigated .",
    "two main goals motivate this paper . on one hand , we give details of the results presented in the rapid communication @xcite where the effects of anisotropy on scaling exponents of the two - point magnetic field correlations have been addressed in the framework of the kinematic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) problem .",
    "non - perturbative expressions for the scaling exponents were derived and their universality proved .",
    "specifically , there arises a picture of a non trivial statistical behavior , where anisotropic fluctuations are organized in a hierarchical order according to their degree of anisotropy .",
    "contributions belonging to shells of higher anisotropic index decay faster , and the isotropic contribution finally dominates .",
    "however , the dominance of the isotropic contribution in the scaling exponents does not imply that large - scale anisotropy is irrelevant for the small - scale magnetic statistics .",
    "a deep investigation focused on a larger number of statistical indices ( that is focused on the proper anisotropy indicators ) has to be performed in order to highlight the way ( if any ) through which large - scale anisotropy manifests itself at small scales .",
    "this is the second aim of the present paper .",
    "specifically , in addition to the non - perturbative results for the two - point correlations , we present new results dealing with higher - order magnetic correlation functions .",
    "being more specific , we exploit the field theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) to obtain the anomalous exponents for higher - order magnetic correlation functions at the first order in @xmath1 , the exponent entering into the velocity covariance . in particular , we evaluate the odd - order correlation function exponents , from which dimensionless ratios like skewness and hyper - skewness are calculated . as a result , in three dimensions ,",
    "the former behaves at the dissipative scale as @xmath11 while the latter as @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the pclet number ( i.e. ,  the equivalent of the reynolds number for the ns turbulence ) .",
    "notice the opposite signs appearing in the scaling exponents .",
    "they are the signature of persistent small - scale activities . indeed , the first index is weakly scale dependent while the second is even divergent at small scales ( i.e. ,  @xmath14 ) .",
    "let us remark that to restore isotropy at small scales all such indices should decay to zero as @xmath13 grows .",
    "the same general picture is found numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite in the framework of the passive scalar advection by ns flows .",
    "in addition , the results are in qualitative agreement with the first - order analytic expressions for the anomalous exponents obtained in @xcite for the passive scalar advected by a synthetic velocity field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : def ] , we give the detailed definition of the kinematic mhd kasantzev  kraichnan model , which describes the passive advection of the magnetic field by the gaussian white - in - time , self - similar velocity field . in sec .",

    "it allows for the derivation of the closed exact equations for the response function and equal - time pair correlation function of the magnetic field . from the homogeneous solutions ( zero modes ) of the pair correlation equation ,",

    "the latter possess an infrared ( ir ) stable fixed point , which establishes the existence of anomalous scaling for all the higher - order correlation functions .",

    "mhd problem , where the reaction of the magnetic field @xmath5 on the velocity field @xmath23 is neglected .",
    "we assume that at the initial stages @xmath5 is weak and does not affect the motions of the conducting fluid : it becomes then a natural assumption to consider the dynamics linear in the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that in more realistic models of the mhd turbulence the magnetic field indeed behaves as a passive vector in the so - called kinetic fixed point of the rg equations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for general velocity fields",
    "the well - known closure problem arises even for the kinematic model .",
    "this means that the equations of evolution for the single - time multiple - space moments such as @xmath35 are not closed .",
    "the situation changes for white - in - time random velocity fields .",
    "the physical choice of a real turbulent flow governed by the ns equation is then replaced by an incompressible , self - similar advecting field , with gaussian statistics and rapidly changing ( @xmath0-correlated ) in time .",
    "this last property allows us to write closed equations for the moments of the magnetic field @xmath5 and to perform analytical ( both perturbative and non - perturbative ) approaches to the @xmath2-dimensional problem .",
    "indeed , in the presence of a white - in - time random velocity field , the solution is a markov process in the time variable and closed moment equations , sometimes called `` hopf equations '' , can be obtained in analogy to the passive scalar case @xcite .",
    "such models have attracted enormous attention recently ( see , e.g. , refs .",
