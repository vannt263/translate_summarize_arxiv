    "_ planck _ but shows a tension with local measurements .    here , we use mock samples in order to test our method .",
    "basically , we are interested to see which covariance function adopted in the gp analysis provides the best match with the fiducial cosmological model . as we shall see , the matrn(5/2 ) performs better , with the standard squared exponential covariance function underestimating the errors . in the next section gp",
    "will be briefly described , showing our results in sec .",
    "we draw our conclusions and discuss future improvements in sec .",
    "a gaussian process allows one to reconstruct a function from data without assuming a parametrisation for it .",
    "while a gaussian distribution is a distribution over random variables , a gaussian process is a distribution over functions .",
    "we use gapp ( gaussian processes in python ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( seikel et al . 2012 ) ) ) in order to reconstruct the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift .",
    "basically , the reconstruction is given by a mean function with gaussian error bands , where the function values at different points @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected through a covariance function @xmath8 .",
    "this covariance function depends on a set of hyperparameters .",
    "for example , the general purpose squared exponential ( sq . exp . )",
    "covariance function is given by @xmath9 in the above equation we have two hyperparameters , the first @xmath10 is related to typical changes in the function value while the second @xmath11 is related to the distance one needs to move in input space before the function value changes significantly .",
    "we follow the steps of @xcite and determine the maximum likelihood value for @xmath10 and @xmath11 in order to obtain the value of the function . in this way",
    ", we are able to reconstruct the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift from @xmath3 measurements . many choices of covariance function are possible , and we consider a variety below .",
    "the freedom in the gp approach comes in the covariance function .",
    "while in traditional parametric analyses we choose a model to characterise what is our prior belief about the function in which we are interested , with gp we ascribe in the covariance function our priors about the expected function properties ( e.g. smoothness , correlation scales etc . ) .",
    "we consider the sq .",
    "covariance function and three examples from the matrn family :",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 is a modified bessel function and we choose @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* seikel & clarkson 2013 for more discussions ) ) .",
    "writing @xmath17 , each matrn function is @xmath18 times differentiable as are functions drawn from it , and the squared exponential is recovered for @xmath19 . increasing @xmath20 increases the width of the covariance function near the peak implying stronger correlations from nearby points for a fixed correlation length @xmath21 . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we also consider two standard parametric models : a flat @xmath1cdm model and a flat xcdm model .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table1 ] together with the constraints from the 19 @xmath3 data .",
    "the coverage test of each covariance function and parametric model was performed by creating 1000 mock catalogues of 19 data points with the same redshifts and error - bars of the measured points in a fiducial @xmath1cdm model . for each model realisation",
    "a value of @xmath0 was derived .",
    "the third and fourth columns of table [ table1 ] show the frequency the true value for @xmath0 was recovered inside the @xmath22 and @xmath23 regions .",
    "so , for example , the matrn@xmath24 covariance function captures the true value at 1(2)@xmath2 about 60%(94% ) of the time   alternatively , the 1(2)@xmath2 region should be interpreted as a 60%(94% ) confidence interval .",
    "this provides a way to re - normalise the @xmath25 intervals for a given covariance function and a prior model assumption , which we show between parentheses for 1@xmath2(68% ) errors in table [ table1 ] .",
    "therefore , this is an attempt to quantify a possible systematic error from the covariance functions _ assuming the true model is @xmath1cdm_. we also considered some different fiducial models with a time - varying dark energy equation of state , 64 data points in the redshift range @xmath26 , with coverages showing the same pattern as depicted in table [ table1 ] .",
    "it is important to note this is a model - dependent comparison which relies on the knowledge of the true model in advance , which is never the case , and changes with the quality of the data .",
    "the coverage can change with a different underlying model as well   but note that the errors are actually much more stable than switching from @xmath1cdm to xcdm .",
