    "the absorption line systems observed in the spectra of background qsos have proven to be a sensitive probe to the physical conditions of intervening gas .",
    "in particular , kinematic studies and chemical abundance measurements of   absorption systems of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath16   at @xmath17 provide a direct assessment of the dynamical characteristics and chemical enrichment history of the absorbers ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ; pettini et al .",

    "while these absorption systems are generally believed to originate in or near galaxies ( because of high   column density and/or large metal content ) , it has been extremely difficult to directly associate the properties of absorption line systems with the properties of galaxies because distant galaxies are faint . on the other hand , at redshift @xmath18 , where galaxies are routinely identified , various galaxy surveys targeted at qso fields have shown that luminous galaxies possess extended mg ii gas out to @xmath19 kpc km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath21 and deceleration parameter @xmath22 throughout this paper . ]",

    "1998 , 2000b ) .",
    "but the origin and physical environment of the extended gas is largely unknown , because of limited information regarding kinematics and metallicity of the gas .",
    "the primary difficulty arises in acquiring a high - quality qso spectrum of wide uv spectral coverage .    to address this issue",
    ", we are initiating a survey of  absorption systems for which high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) uv spectra are available and for which the absorbing galaxies have been identified . in this _ letter",
    "_ , we present the first results of this survey based on the study of a  absorption system at @xmath25 toward pks0405@xmath21219 ( @xmath26 ) , for which high - quality echelle spectra have been obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "this system is especially interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , previous measurements show that this system has a rest - frame  absorption equivalent width of 0.65  , implying an  column density @xmath27 @xmath28 for a reasonable range of doppler parameter ( chen et al .",
    "this suggests that the absorber is a partial lyman limit system at @xmath29 , which may provide a benchmark for comparison against lyman limit systems ( lls ) at high redshift .",
    "second , two galaxies have been identified at the absorber redshift ( spinrad et al .",
    "1993 ; chen et al .",
    "a detailed study of this absorption system therefore serves to constrain the physical properties of the galaxy environment , which offers a unique opportunity to investigate whether qso absorption line systems arise in extended halos of individual galaxies or in intragroup media of galaxy groups .",
    "spectroscopic observations of pks 0405@xmath21219 were accessed from the hst data archive . the qso was observed with hst using stis in echelle mode with a @xmath30 slit and the e140 m grating ( @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) for a total exposure time of 27,208 s. the observations were carried out in two visits of five exposures each .",
    "the individual echelle spectra were reduced , extracted , and calibrated using standard pipeline techniques , and were coadded to form an averaged spectrum and a 1 @xmath33 error array per visit using our own reduction program . to form a final spectrum for absorption line studies , we normalized each coadded spectrum with a best - fit , low - order polynomial continuum and calculated a weighted average of the normalized spectra with the weighting factor determined by the squares of the snr .",
    "the final spectrum covers a spectral range that spans from @xmath34 1140   to @xmath34 1730   and has snr of @xmath35 per resolution element in most of the spectral region .",
    "we identified absorption features produced by h@xmath5 , c@xmath4 , n@xmath4 , o@xmath5 , si@xmath4 , si@xmath6 , si@xmath7 , possibly fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath6 ; and most interestingly we identified the absorption doublets produced by n@xmath9 and o@xmath8 for the absorption system at @xmath1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the velocity profiles of all transitions with @xmath36 corresponding to redshift @xmath37 .",
    "we first determined the  column density by fitting voigt profiles to the saturated  and  absorption lines using the vpfit package provided by r. carswell and j. webb .",
    "but because of the degeneracy between @xmath38 and @xmath39 for saturated voigt profiles , we found that while the profile fitting procedure yielded a best fit of the absorption system at @xmath1 . ]",
    "@xmath40   with @xmath41 , solutions with similar reduced @xmath42 range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 for @xmath39 from 36  to 26",
    ". additional spectroscopic observations of the qso in the far uv wavelength range ( e.g.  with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) are required to precisely measure the  column density using higher - order lyman series absorption . despite the large uncertainty in the  column density",
    ", we confirmed that the absorber is a partial lls with @xmath45 @xmath28 .",
    "next , we measured the ionic column densities using the apparent optical depth method ( savage & sembach 1991 ) , which provides an accurate column density estimate for resolved , unsaturated absorption lines .",
    "the column density measurements are presented in table 1 , which lists the ions , the corresponding rest - frame absorption wavelength @xmath46 , and the estimated ionic column densities @xmath47 together with the associated errors in the first three columns .",
    "lower limits indicate that the lines are saturated in the stis spectrum .",
    "the detections of n@xmath9 and o@xmath8 at the absorber redshift are very interesting , because these ions are often believed to form through collisional ionization in hot gas clouds .",
    "we show in figure 1 that all the ions except n@xmath9 and o@xmath8 have consistent profile signatures that trace the partial lls , while the  and  doublets appear to be broad and have velocity centroids blue - shifted by @xmath34 30  from the other ions .",
    "the differences in kinematic signatures strongly indicate that the  and   doublets and the partial lls traced by the other ions do not arise in the same regions . for this reason",
    ", we studied the physical environment separately for the two gas regions .",
    "we first determined the temperature of the partial lls using the @xmath39 parameters estimated from a voigt profile analysis for the unsaturated lines produced by si@xmath4 and n@xmath4 .",
    "the estimates of the @xmath39 parameters are presented in the forth column of table 1 .",
    "we found that @xmath48   for si@xmath4 and @xmath49  for n@xmath4 . because both thermal motion and bulk motion contribute to the measured doppler parameter and because si@xmath4 and n@xmath4 share the same bulk motion , we solved for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we found that @xmath52  and @xmath53 k with a 1 @xmath33 lower limit being @xmath54 k and 1 @xmath33 upper limit being @xmath55 k.    according to sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) , collisional ionization models can not produce the observed relative abundances for the si ions at temperatures between @xmath54 k and @xmath55 k. it is therefore very unlikely that the partial lls is collisionally ionized .",
    "we determined the ionization state of the partial lls by comparing the column densities of h@xmath5 , si@xmath56 , si@xmath6 , and si@xmath7 with the predictions from a series of photoionization models calculated using the cloudy software package ( ferland 1995 ) .",
    "considering a plane - parallel geometry for gas of solar metallicity , we calculated the column density predictions for various ions .",
    "the predictions of relative ionic column densities are fairly insensitive to the adopted metallicity and  column density ( for optically thin gas ) in the cloudy calculations , even though the absolute predictions may vary accordingly .",
    "therefore , we were able to place reasonably tight constraints on the ionization parameter , which is the ratio of incident ionizing photons to the total hydrogen number density , @xmath57 , by comparing the relative abundances of the si ions .",

    "given the best estimated @xmath63 , we determined the total hydrogen column density @xmath64 , ionization fraction @xmath65 , hydrogen number density @xmath66 , and the spatial extent for the partial lls .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .    finally , we estimated the elemental abundances of the partial lls using the ionization fraction correction calculated from the cloudy model for an ionization parameter @xmath67 .",
    "the results are shown in the last column of table 1 for an  column density @xmath68 . adopting the largest possible  column density @xmath69 @xmath28",
    ", we found that the partial lls would have @xmath10 solar abundance determined for carbon and silicon and @xmath70 solar abundance for nitrogen . adopting the best fit @xmath38 of @xmath71 , we derived a super - solar metallicity for the system .",
    "in addition , we also estimated the chemical abundance using the  absorption line . in regions where the resonant charge - exchange reaction between oxygen and hydrogen becomes dominant",
    ", the column density ratio @xmath72 $ ] provides a direct estimate of the elemental abundance of oxygen . otherwise , the ratio @xmath72 $ ] provides a lower limit to the estimate of oxygen elemental abundance . we derived a metallicity of at least @xmath73 solar for oxygen and contend that the absorbing gas has been heavily enriched in metals .    the results obtained from the cloudy analysis demonstrated that a single photoionization model can not explain the observed column densities of the o@xmath8 and n@xmath9 ions .",
    "at the extreme upper limit @xmath74 , both  and  are predicted to be at least 0.4 dex less abundant than .",
    "but our measurements indicate that  and  are at least 0.4 dex more abundant than all the si ions . in agreement with our assessment of the kinematic characteristics",
    ", the cloudy predictions further demonstrated that o@xmath8 and n@xmath9 do not arise in the partial lls . under the assumption of collisional ionization ,",
    "the temperature of o@xmath8 and n@xmath9 may be derived by comparing their column density ratio with a series of collisional ionization models .",
    "according to shapiro & moore ( 1976 ) , an optically thin gas of solar relative abundance at thermal equilibrium with @xmath75 has a temperature of @xmath76 k 5% if the relative abundance of oxygen to nitrogen is twice the solar . ] .",
    "at this temperature , we calculated the total hydrogen column density using the ionization fraction correction calculated by sutherland & dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "we also estimated the bulk motion of these ions by fitting voigt profiles to the  and   absorption doublets .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "our analysis of the stis echelle spectrum revealed unusual properties of the  absorption system at @xmath1 .",
    "we found a chemically enriched , warm gas region giving rise to the partial lls and a hot gas region giving rise to o@xmath8 and n@xmath9 along the qso line of sight .",
    "two galaxies have been identified in the field of pks0405@xmath21219 at the absorber redshift ( spinrad et al .",
    "1993 ; chen et al .",
    "2000b ) : ( 1 ) an elliptical galaxy at @xmath77 with an angular distance @xmath78 to the qso ( corresponding to an impact parameter @xmath79 kpc ) and a rest - frame @xmath80-band luminosity @xmath81 and ( 2 ) a spiral galaxy at @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( corresponding to @xmath84 kpc ) and @xmath85 . while it is not uncommon to find tenuous gas at large galactic distance ( @xmath86 kpc ) around nearby elliptical galaxies ( e.g.  fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) or groups of galaxies ( e.g.  mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is very surprising to find metal - enriched , high - column density gas at this large distance .",
    "furthermore , our column density estimates for o@xmath8 and n@xmath9 are comparable to the measurements obtained for highly ionized gas in the galactic halo , most of which is believed to arise near the galactic plane ( savage , sembach , & lu 1997 ; savage et al .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the elliptical galaxy exhibit signs of recent star formation ( spinrad et al .",
    "1993 ) , therefore the physical process that initiated the recent star formation might be responsible for transporting metals to large galactic distance .    in light of the different kinematic characteristics between the partial lls and the  absorbing cloud , it seems likely that the partial lls is embedded within a larger volume of hot  gas that is spread out in a galactic halo or an intragroup medium .",
    "but it is very rare to detect hot gas at a temperature @xmath87 k , where the cooling function is the most effective ( see e.g.  spitzer 1978 ) . in order for the the hot gas to remain at this temperature ,",
    "we derive rough estimates of the underlying mass and gas number density assuming a simple isothermal halo .",
    "specifically , a more massive system would have a higher virial temperature and consequently raise the gas temperature through gravitational interaction .",
    "a higher gas density would increase the cooling rate and consequently lower the gas temperature through collisional cooling processes .",
    "we estimate the mass of the galaxy or galaxy group that supports the extended hot gas by requiring a virial temperature @xmath88 k and find that a total mass of @xmath89 for a half - mass radius @xmath90 mpc .",
    "we estimate the number density by requiring a cooling time longer than the dynamical time , @xmath91 , and find that the number density of the absorbing gas should be @xmath14 @xmath15 for a velocity dispersion @xmath92  at @xmath93 kpc ( implying @xmath94 3.5 gyr ) .",
    "although two galaxies have been identified at the absorber redshift , it is very difficult to determine whether the absorbing gas originates in extended halos of individual galaxies or in an intragroup medium of an underlying galaxy group without a more complete spectroscopic survey of galaxies in this field .",
    "we can however derive constraints on the properties of the galaxies either individually or collectively for both scenarios based on all the available measurements .",
    "comparison of galaxies and  absorption systems along common lines of sight has shown that the gaseous extent @xmath95 of galaxies of all morphological types scales with galaxy @xmath80-band luminosity @xmath96 according to @xmath97 ( chen et al .",
    "according to these authors , we expect that the extended gas of the spiral galaxy would contribute an  column density of no more than @xmath98 @xmath28 at @xmath99 kpc , but that the extended gas of the elliptical galaxy would easily contribute an  column density of @xmath100 @xmath28 at @xmath79 kpc . by carefully examining deep images obtained both with hst using the wide field and planetary camera 2 with the f702w filter and with the irtf 3 m telescope using the k filter",
    ", we find that if there are unidentified dwarf galaxies at the absorber redshift and closer to the qso line of sight , then they can not be brighter than @xmath101 .",
    "it is therefore more likely that the absorbing clouds should follow the halo motion of the bright elliptical galaxy if the absorption system arises in individual galactic halos . assuming that the absorption system is produced in the gaseous halo of the elliptical galaxy and adopting a king profile for the gas distribution around the elliptical galaxy , @xmath102 $ ] , we derive a total gas mass of @xmath103 within a radius @xmath104 kpc for a core radius between @xmath105 and 50 kpc and for a unit filling factor .",
    "the estimated gas mass within @xmath106 kpc is significantly lower than the dynamical mass @xmath107 estimated for @xmath108 , implying a small gas fraction in the inner part of the elliptical galaxy .",
    "mulchaey et al .  (",
    "1996 ) suggested that an intragroup medium of temperature just below the detection threshold of existing x - ray observations may reveal itself through the imprint of high - ionization absorption lines , such as   and ne viii , in the spectra of background qsos .",
    "recent observations also indicated that some  absorption lines originate in an environment of excess galaxy counts ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ) . adopting the @xmath109 correlation obtained for groups of galaxies in x - ray ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) and extrapolating to lower temperature",
    ", we find a corresponding velocity dispersion of @xmath110 60  for @xmath12 k , which is very close to the estimated bulk motion for the  absorbing gas .",
    "based on the estimated velocity dispersion , we derive a total mass of @xmath111 for the galaxy group assuming a virialized isothermal halo and a half - mass radius @xmath112 mpc .",
    "therefore , we find that if the absorption system is produced in the intragroup medium , then the total mass of the underlying galaxy group is comparable to the local group ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "the absorber at @xmath1 exhibits striking resemblance to the lls at @xmath113 presented by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1994 ) both in physical properties of the absorbing gas and in the surrounding galaxy environment .",
    "the absorber at @xmath114 was found to have a metallicity of a half solar and likely be embedded in a hot  gas of @xmath115 k. a group of galaxies have been identified at the absorber redshift , the closest of which is at 110 @xmath23 kpc to the qso line of sight .",
    "if the two systems are representative of low - redshift llss , then the relationship between llss and surrounding galaxies may provide important clues regarding the chemical enrichment history and dynamics of gas in intragroup media . on the other hand , various models have been proposed to explain extended  gas at large galactic distance , including satellite accretion ( wang 1993 ) , tidal debris ( morris & van den bergh 1994 ) , and two - phase galactic halos ( mo & miralda - escud 1996 ) . of these models ,",
    "accretion from a star - forming satellite galaxy is the most likely to explain the observed high - metallicity gas at large distance to regular - looking galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "finally , comparison of the absorber at @xmath1 and known high - redshift llss ( khler et al .",
    "1999 ; lopez et al .  1999 ;",
    "prochaska 1999 ; prochaska & burles 1999 ; rauch et al .",
    "1999 ) shows that all but one ( rauch et al . ) of these lyman limit absorbers have similar estimates of the ionization parameter @xmath63 .",
    "if the majority of llss continue to exhibit @xmath116 at all epochs , then it clearly calls for the question whether these systems share similar physical properties such as gas temperature .",
