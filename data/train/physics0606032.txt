    "manganese clusters are particularly interesting among all 3@xmath5 transition metal elements due to the 4@xmath6 , 3@xmath7 electronic configuration in mn atoms . because of the filled 4@xmath8 and half - filled 3@xmath5 shells and the large energy gap @xmath9 8 ev between these levels and as well as due to the high 4@xmath63@xmath7 @xmath10 4@xmath113@xmath12 promotion energy of 2.14 ev@xcite , mn atoms do not bind strongly . as a result",

    "this weak mn@xmath2 mn bonding has been demonstrated through the photodissociation experiments for mn@xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) cluster cations@xcite .",
    "consequently , the bulk @xmath17-mn , which has a very complex lattice structure with 58 atoms in the unit cell , has the lowest binding energy among all the 3@xmath5 transition metal elements .",
    "magnetic properties of manganese clusters are rather unusual . according to hund s rule ,",
    "the half - filled localized 3@xmath5 electrons give rise to large atomic magnetic moment of 5 @xmath18 . an early electron spin resonance ( esr ) study suggested a magnetic moment of 5 @xmath18/atom for very small mn clusters@xcite .",
    "however , stern - gerlach ( sg ) molecular beam experiments on mn@xmath19 clusters by knickelbein recently revealed the net magnetic moments ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 @xmath18/atom@xcite .",
    "this differs both from the ferromagnetic ( fm ) small clusters and from the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) bulk @xmath17-mn .",
    "this experimental results can be explained either way that the individual atomic moments are small and ordered ferromagnetically or the individual atomic moments remain large but their orientation flips from site to site i.e. , they are coupled ferrimagnetically . in the sg experiment , it is important to note the relative decrease in the magnetic moment for mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 , as well as the relatively very large experimental uncertainty in the measured magnetic moment for mn@xmath22@xcite . in the present work , we will show that the local minima for mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 arise due to their ` closed ' icosahedral structures , whereas , the large experimental uncertainty ( @xmath14 58 % of the measured value ) in the magnetic moment of mn@xmath22 is plausibly due to the production of different magnetic isomers ( in addition with statistical fluctuation ) in the subsequent measurements .",
    "earlier all electron ( ae ) studies @xcite found mn@xmath2mn fm ordering for mn@xmath0 ( @xmath23 4 ) clusters , which , in turn , is not consistent with the sg experiment",

    "this might be attributed to the reason that the us - pp may not be appropriate in describing the transition metals with large magnetic moments .",
    "this will be discussed briefly later in the section [ sec : methodology ] .",
    "our main motivation of this work is particularly driven by the sg experiments@xcite . here",
    "we shall investigate @xmath2 ( i ) the structural and magnetic evolution of mn@xmath0 clusters , @xmath24=2 - 20 .",
    "( ii ) the sudden drop in the magnetic moment at @xmath24=13 and 19 and the very large experimental uncertainty in the measured magnetic moment for mn@xmath22 , and ( iii ) the possible presence of isomers with different magnetic structures in the sg experimental molecular beam .",
    "it has also been found by parks _",
    "_ that the mn@xmath0 clusters show a downward discontinuity in their reaction rate with molecular hydrogen at @xmath1 16 , and this was attributed to non - metal to metal transition in mn@xmath26@xcite .",
    "but if this is indeed true then there should be a downward decrease in the ionization potential too .",
    "however , no such abrupt decrease has been seen in the measured ionization potential@xcite . in the present paper , we calculate both the spin gaps to investigate this issue .",
    "the calculations are performed using density functional theory ( dft ) , within the pseudopotential plane wave method .",
    "we have used projector augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite and perdew - bruke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite for spin - polarized generalized gradient correction ( gga ) as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite .",

    "reciprocal space integrations are carried out at the @xmath27 point .",
    "symmetry unrestricted geometry and spin optimizations are performed using conjugate gradient and quasi - newtonian methods until all the force components are less than a threshold value 0.005 ev/. simple cubic supercells are used with the periodic boundary conditions , where two neighboring clusters are kept separated by at least 12 vacuum space . for each size",
    ", several initial geometrical structures have been considered . to get the ground state magnetic moment",
    "we have explicitly considered _ all possible _ spin configurations for each geometrical structure . for transition metals with large magnetic moments",
    ", the paw method seems to be more appropriate ( as good as the ae calculations ) than the us - pp approach@xcite .",
    "the us - pp overestimates the magnetization energies and this overestimation is even more large for gga calculations than local spin density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gga functionals are more sensitive to the shape of the wave functions than the lsda functionals .",
    "however , the difference between these two methods , us - pp and paw , are solely related to the pseudization of the augmentation charges in the us - pp approach , which can be removed by choosing very accurate pseudized augmentation function , which is then computationally expensive . for a better description",

    "the mn@xmath13 dimer is the most controversial among all the sizes we have studied .",

    "very small binding energy , 0.52 ev / atom , is essentially the characteristic of a van der waals system .",
    "however , the bond dissociation energy increases by considerable amount due to the reduction of one electron from the mn@xmath13 dimer , i.e. by creating a hole in the 4@xmath8 level . as measured by the photodissociation experiment the bond dissociation ( mn@xmath35 @xmath36 mn ) energy increases to 1.39 ev for mn@xmath37 cation@xcite .",
    "we find that the bond length of mn@xmath13 decreases monotonically as the net moment decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the physical picture that the reduction of the interatomic spacing leads to comparatively stronger overlap of the atomic orbitals which , in turn , reduces the magnetic moment .",
    "however , we find mn@xmath13 with total moment 4 and 6 @xmath18 are not bound .",
    "an af mn@xmath13 is 0.52 ev higher in energy with bond length 2.61 .",
    "the present results , along with the previous ae - dft calculations @xcite , do not agree with the experimental results .",
    "this might be attributed to the fact that the density functional theory is not adequate in treating van der waals interaction properly .",
    "however , there is no experimental results available in the gas phase mn@xmath13 dimer and the esr experiment was done in a rare gas matrix .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the mn atoms do interact with the matrix , which could stretch the bond length and could lead to the observed afm state .",
    "the case of mn@xmath38 is extremely interesting as it could have either fm or a frustrated afm structure .",
    "we have studied triangular and linear structures .",
    "an equilateral triangular fm state with total moment 15 @xmath18 is found to be the ground state with bond lengths 2.74 and binding energy 0.82 ev / atom .",

    "three isomers are found and all of them are tetrahedral . a ferrimagnetic state with total moment",
    "10 @xmath18 is only 0.08 ev higher in energy .",
    "another ferrimagnetic state with total moment 8 @xmath18 is found to be degenerate with the af state with no net moment and they are 0.20 ev higher in energy . in all these optimal structures",
    "the distances between two similar spins ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) are larger than those of between two opposite spins ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "our results are consistent with the previous ae calculations@xcite .",
    "et al . _ @xcite have studied mn@xmath34 in solid silicon and observed a 21-line hyperfine pattern that not only establishes the four atoms to be equivalent , but also the total moment to be 20 @xmath18 .",
    "however , the present results can not directly be compared with this experiment because of possible si - mn interaction and there is no available report of magnetic ordering for mn@xmath34 in its gas phase .",
    "as the number of atoms in the cluster ( @xmath24 ) increases the determination of the structural and magnetic ground state becomes a very delicate task as the number of local minima in the corresponding potential energy surface increases exponentially with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , more than one geometric and/or magnetic structures of comparable stability are possible . in the fig.[fig:5to10 ] we depict the atomic and magnetic structures for the ground state as well as for the closely lying isomers for the size range @xmath1 5 - 10 .",

    "this is because of the pauli repulsion .      the size dependence of the ground state binding energy for mn@xmath0 clusters ( @xmath32 - 20 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binding ] . due to the lack of hybridization between the half - filled 3@xmath5 and filled 4@xmath8 states and due to high 4@xmath63@xmath7 @xmath10 4@xmath113@xmath12 promotion energy ,",
    "the mn@xmath13 dimer is a weakly bound dimer , which is a characteristic of van der waals bonding@xcite . as the number of atoms in the cluster increases , the binding energy increases monotonically due to the increase in the @xmath56 hybridization .",
    "however , it remains weak as compared to the other transition metal clusters in the same size range .",
    "this weak bonding has been demonstrated through the photodissociation experiments for mn@xmath57 ( @xmath24 @xmath58 7 ) cluster cations@xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that if an as - atom is doped to the mn@xmath0 clusters , the binding energies of the resultant mn@xmath0as clusters increase substantially due to their hybridized @xmath56 electrons bond with the @xmath59 electrons of as .",
    "similar enhancement in bonding has also been seen due to the single nitrogen doping@xcite .    upon extrapolation of the linear fit to the binding energy per atom data to @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : binding](a ) )",
    ", we obtained the binding energy for an infinitely large cluster as 2.80 ev , which is very close to the experimental af bulk @xmath17-mn ( 2.92 ev ) .",
    "it is important here to note the kinks observed at @xmath3 7 and 13 in the binding energy curve ( fig.[fig : binding ] ) .",
    "these kinks represent enhanced stability rendered by their ` closed ' geometric structures : mn@xmath22 is pbp and mn@xmath20 is the first complete icosahedra",
    ". if this argument is valid then there should also be a kink at @xmath3 19 , due to the fact it has double icosahedral structure .",
    "but we do not see any prominent kink in the binding energy curve .",
    "so , it will be interesting to investigate the second difference in the binding energy , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 represents the total energy of an @xmath63atom cluster .",
    "as @xmath64 represents stability of the corresponding cluster compared to its neighbors , the effect will be prominent .",
    "@xmath65 is plotted in the fig.[fig : binding](b ) , where we see a peak for mn@xmath21 too along with @xmath3 7 and 13 .",
    "however , in addition , without any a priory reason , we observe another peak at @xmath3 17 , which does not have ` closed ' structure ( a double icosahedra without two apex atoms ) .      for very small clusters , @xmath664 , the magnetic coupling is found to be fm with magnetic moments 5 @xmath18/atom , which is the hund s rule value for an isolated mn atom .",
    "although we see that for mn@xmath38 cluster the fm solution is nearly degenerate with the frustrated afm solution .",
    "the size dependence of the magnetic moment per atom is plotted in the fig.[fig : magmom ] .",
    "we see the transition in the magnetic coupling ( from fm to ferrimagnetic ) takes place at @xmath67 and the ferrimagnetic states continue to be the ground state for the entire size range @xmath35 - 20 .",
    "fig.[fig : magmom ] shows a very good agreement between experimentally measured and our predicted magnetic moments .",
    "it was seen in the sg experiment that the experimental uncertainty in measuring the magnetic moment decreases with the cluster size . however , this is not the case for mn@xmath22 , for which the measured uncertainty is quite large ( 0.72@xmath140.42 @xmath18 , @xmath1458% of the measured value ) as compared to the neighboing sizes .",
    "this large uncertainty might arise from the presence of isomers with different magnetic moments in the sg beam for subsequent measurements .",
    "however , in addition with the statistical fluctuation , the above explanation only stands for a plausible reason as for all other sizes we did find many isomers with different magnetic moments ( see table [ tab : bemag ] and fig.[fig : magmom ] ) , but the corresponding experimental uncertainty is not that large .",
    "one another striking feature observed in the experiment is the sudden decrease in the magnetic moment at @xmath24=13 and 19 , compared to their neighbors .",
    "our calculation reproduces this feature .",
    "this is attributed to their ` closed ' icosahedral structures : first complete icosahedra for mn@xmath20 and a double icosahedra for mn@xmath21 .",
    "the other geometries studied viz .",
    "hexagonal closed packed and cuboctahedral structures for mn@xmath20 and a fcc structure for mn@xmath21 lie much higher in energy , 0.89 ev ( 9 @xmath18 ) , 1.12 ev ( 11 @xmath18 ) and 1.53 ev ( 17 @xmath18 ) , respectively , than their corresponding ground state .    in the fig.[fig : magmom ] we have depicted the magnetic moments of the very closely lying isomers with their ground state ( see table [ tab : bemag ] ) and while comparing those with the experimentally observed values , we come to the conclusion that for a particular size of cluster , the isomers with different magnetic moments are likely to be present in the sg cluster beam with a statistical weight and essentially , the measured moment is the weighted average of those isomers .",
    "we calculate the energy difference between the optimal fm and optimal ferrimagnetic solutions , @xmath68 , and plot them as a function of cluster size @xmath24 in the fig.[fig : deltae ] . for both mn@xmath38 and mn@xmath34",
    "the fm solutions are slightly lower in energy than those of their respective optimal ferrimagnetic solutions , whereas the optimal fm solutions are slightly higher than the corresponding ferrimagnetic ground states for mn@xmath43 and mn@xmath45 .",
    "thereafter , as the cluster size increases , this energy difference , @xmath69 , increases almost monotonically indicating that the optimal fm solutions become more and more unlikely .",
    "all these optimal fm states have @xmath9 4 @xmath18/atom magnetic moments .",
    "the angular momentum projected local density of states ( ldos ) show interesting site dependency .",
    "the @xmath8- , @xmath59- and @xmath5-projected ldos for the central and surface atoms are plotted in the fig.[fig : localization ] for the mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 clusters .",
    "we see only @xmath5-projected ldos are significant and are of great interest here .",
    "the @xmath5-projected ldos of both mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 for the central atoms are broad for both majority and minority spin states , which are also reflected through their small values of the integrated spin densities @xmath29 ( 1.42 and -1.41 @xmath18 for mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "the broadening occurs due to the high coordination of the central atom . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath5-projected ldos of the surface atoms are rather localized and the majority spins are nearly fully occupied , which is in agreement with the relatively large local magnetic moments of the surface atoms ( 3.60 and 3.44 @xmath18 for mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 , respectively ) .      a spin arrangement in any magnetic clusters is magnetically stable only if both the spin gaps , @xmath70 \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta_2 \\ & = & \\ - \\ \\left [ \\ \\epsilon_{\\rm homo}^{\\rm minority } \\ - \\                                  \\epsilon_{\\rm lumo}^{\\rm majority } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are positive , i.e. the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the majority spin lies above the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the minority spin and vice versa .",
    "we find these two spin gaps to be positive for all the clusters ( table [ tab : bemag ] ) discussed here and are plotted in the fig.[fig : spingaps ] .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 have local structures , but generally decreases slowly as the coordination increases with cluster size .",
    "_ found that the mn@xmath0 clusters with @xmath73 15 are not reactive towards molecular hydrogen , whereas they form stable hydrides at and above @xmath1 16 , and the reaction rate varies considerably with the cluster size@xcite .",
    "they argued it to be attributed from the non - metal to metal transition at @xmath1 16 . if this is indeed the reason , it is likely that the ionization potential would show a significant decrease at mn@xmath26 , similar to what has been observed for free mercury clusters@xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect closing up of the spin gaps at @xmath1 16 . however , koretsky _ et al .",
    "_ observed no sudden decrease in the measured ionization potential @xcite and we do not find any spin gap closing at mn@xmath26 either .",
    "the spin gaps have reasonable value , @xmath74 0.33 ev and @xmath75 0.22 ev for mn@xmath26 cluster ( fig.[fig : spingaps ] and table [ tab : bemag ] ) .",
    "this abrupt change in the reaction rate with h@xmath13 at mn@xmath26 is not due to any structural change either , as we find all the medium sized clusters adopt icosahedral growth pattern and the reason for the observed change in the reaction rate remains unknown .",
    "we have systematically investigated the structural , electronic and magnetic properties of mn@xmath0 ( @xmath24 = 2 - 20 ) clusters from the first - principles density functional theory .",
    "an extensive search have been made to locate the global minima . due to the intrinsic 4@xmath6 3@xmath7 electronic structure and high 4@xmath63@xmath7 @xmath10 4@xmath113@xmath12 promotion energy mn - atoms",
    "do not bind strongly when they come closer to form a cluster .",
    "however , binding energy increases with the cluster size as the coordination number increases and reaches a value 2.37 ev / atom for mn@xmath51 , which is 81 % of the bulk value . a magnetic transition from fm to ferrimagnetic",
    "ordering takes place at @xmath24 = 5 and thereafter the energy difference between the optimal ferrimagnetic and optimal fm structure increases with the cluster size , which indicates that the optimal fm states become more and more unfavorable with increasing cluster size . however , different ferrimagnetic states are possible within a small @xmath9 0.1 ev energy difference and their plausible presence in the experimental sg beam along with the ground state has been argued .",
    "the predicted magnetic moments are in agreement with the sg experiment .",
    "the sudden decrease in the magnetic moment at @xmath24 = 13 and 19 is due to their ` closed ' icosahedral structure .",
    "it should be pointed out here that in the present calculation we assumed only collinear alignment of spins .",
    "however , spin canting or noncollinear magnetic ordering is possible in small magnetic clusters as it occurs more easily in a low symmetry magnetic system@xcite .",
    "icosahedral growth pattern is observed for the intermediate size range .",
    "however , to our knowledge , a different kind of icosahedral packing have been observed for mn@xmath25 @xmath2 mn@xmath54 clusters . in any particular cluster ,",
    "the average bond length between antiferromagnetically aligned atoms are 3@xmath28 % shorter than that of the ferromagnetically alligned , which can be explained in terms of the pauli repulsion .",
    "spin segregation has been observed in the intermediate size range .",
    "the @xmath4electron localization strongly depends on coordination : localization decreases with the coordination number .",
    "there is no signature of non - metal to metal transition at @xmath24 = 16 , which has been predicted@xcite through the downward discontinuity observed in the reaction rate with h@xmath13 .",
