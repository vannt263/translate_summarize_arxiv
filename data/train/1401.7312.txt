    "there are strong reasons to believe that there is a connection between gravity and thermodynamics , even though , so far we do not know what the microscopic degrees of freedom are in this case .",
    "historically , the laws of black hole mechanics @xcite , which are of a form strikingly similar to that of the laws of thermodynamics , came first .",
    "motivated by this and other considerations , bekenstein proposed that the black holes have a temperature and possess an entropy proportional to the surface area of the black hole event horizon@xcite .",
    "the similarity became much more physically compelling , once hawking radiation was discovered from semiclassical considerations@xcite . around the same time",
    ", it was discovered that even in the minkowski spacetime , an accelerating observer in a rindler frame would encounter thermal radiation whereas an inertial observer sees only vacuum @xcite .",
    "the black hole spacetime and the rindler spacetime have one thing in common , causal horizons exist for both of them .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations in the frame of the inertial observer are seen as thermal fluctuations by the rindler observer .",
    "this correspondence holds for the flat spacetime .",
    "however , it is possible to consider accelerating observers at any spacetime point and construct a locally rindler patch around it .",
    "such observers are expected to find themselves in a thermal environment .",
    "the temperature detected by them is proportional to the acceleration as in rindler spacetime .",
    "one notices here an interesting similarity between observers who remain outside black holes and observers who are locally accelerating . for black holes , however , the analogy of the laws of black hole mechanics with thermodynamics was noticed before the discovery of the thermal nature of the radiation from the black hole .",
    "but it is also possible to proceed in the reverse direction and explore whether the thermal nature of the radiation encountered locally by the accelerated observer in a spacetime is accompanied by some interesting consequences of thermodynamics .",
    "a pioneering step in this direction was taken by jacobson@xcite .",
    "for this , he had to use the thermodynamic properties of a rindler - like horizon in a local construction .",
    "so he considered an observer accelerating at a constant rate in an arbitrary spacetime in such a way that one can construct a locally rindler patch containing the observer , with the rindler horizon forming a part of its boundary .",
    "the amount of matter - energy that passed through this horizon was taken to be the increase in the heat energy , @xmath1 , while the increase in the horizon area was assumed to be proportional the increase in the entropy @xmath2 of the system . assuming this",
    ", he was able to show that the relation , @xmath3 , then gives back the einstein equation .",
    "based on this result , it was suggested by him that gravity itself could be viewed as an emergent phenomenon [ also see discussions in @xcite ] .",
    "this derivation has recently been extended to include some other theories of gravity as well @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is clear that such a derivation of the einstein equation has two inherent limitations .",
    "the first one is that for the inertial - rindler observer correspondence between vacuum - thermal fluctuations to work , the spacetime has to be flat and this in general is only possible to achieve locally . that , however , does not pose any real problem . in fact , it could be thought of as an attractive feature of this derivation , where the einstein equation emerges as a consequence of the thermodynamics at a local level .",
    "the second limitation is essentially a restriction in the class of locally accelerating observers , for whom this derivation of the einstein equation from thermodynamics works .",
    "it arises mainly from the consideration of what the accelerating observer is going to see and interpret as an increase in heat energy .",
    "the idea here is that the information about the degrees of freedom of a macroscopic body is lost to the observer as it reaches the horizon .",
    "that energy then appears as heat energy to the observer , who remains outside the horizon .",
    "this intuition receives strong support from other considerations like the first law of horizon thermodynamics @xcite and the results obtained within the membrane paradigm for black holes @xcite .",
    "this implies that to make use of the thermodynamic correspondence , the local rindler patch has to be constructed in such a way that the rindler horizon forms a part of the boundary of that patch .",
    "in addition to this , there is a further constraint , which is more technical in nature . for jacobson s derivation to work ,",
    "one has to consider matter - energy passing through close to the bifurcation surface of the rindler horizon of the local rindler patch .",
    "the bifurcation surface of a rindler wedge is at a distance of @xmath4 from the accelerating observer .",
    "now , from the consideration of riemann normal c.s . , the size @xmath5 of the local patch would be such that @xmath6 .",
    "the distance of the rindler observer from the bifurcation point should not exceed that length scale .",
    "it follows then that the acceleration should be such that , @xmath7 .",
    "this condition restricts the class of locally accelerating observers , for whom the einstein equation is a consequence of thermodynamics .",
    "thus among all the observers , who are locally accelerating , the above derivation of einstein equation from thermodynamics would only hold for the subclass of observers , who accelerate at a rate much higher than the scale set by the curvature of the spacetime .",
    "it is possible to take a limit where the acceleration goes to infinity and so does the boost energy , which passes through the horizon , making the analysis strictly local .",
    "in fact , this was the way , that this analysis was carried out originally by jacobson @xcite . from the thermodynamic point of view , this means that the temperature is going to infinity and so does the amount of heat generated as seen by the observer .",
    "there ratio remains finite however and gives the change in the entropy of the system .",
    "it is important to note here that one can take this limit sensibly because the amount of entropy increase is independent of the scale of the acceleration .",
    "this is a feature that is expected to persist in our generalisation of jacobson s derivation .",
    "the accelerating observer sees thermal radiation at a temperature proportional to @xmath0 in a rindler patch bounded on one side by a rindler horizon .",
    "it is less clear however , whether an observer accelerating locally , for whom the rindler horizon does not exist in a local patch , would still find herself in a thermal environment .",
    "here we demonstrate by a semiclassical calculation that such an observer would detect a temperature proportional to the acceleration .",
    "we focus on the fourier modes of a massless scalar field , which are localised within this patch and build up fock states using only those modes .",
    "then it can be shown that provided the inertial observer sees a vacuum state , the accelerating observer finds the environment to be thermal with a temperature proportional to the acceleration .    normally , if a system has a temperature , then one can reasonably expect that a thermodynamic description exists for the macroscopic processes concerning the system .",
    "this was found to be true for black holes .",
    "jacobson s derivation of einstein equation from thermodynamics is also a confirmation of that expectation . from this point of view",
    ", the restriction of this derivation to a subclass of locally accelerating observers appears unsatisfactory .",
    "the locally accelerating observers who have been excluded , also detect a temperature .",
    "so a thermodynamic description should exist for all the observers , who are accelerating locally .",
    "one can also note the work done by verlinde@xcite in this context , who claimed that gravity can be thought of as an entropic force . in particular , assuming that the relevant degrees of freedom for gravity resides on two dimensional spacelike surfaces , through which the matter passes and equipartition theorem holds for such degrees of freedom , he was able to derive the einstein equation , or more precisely , the time - time component of it @xcite .",
    "our approach here is different from the entropic gravity perspective and hence we would not refer to it any further . however , it is important to note that his work suggested that a thermodynamic interpretation may also be possible for observers not belonging to the class , for which jacobson s method works .",
    "the possibility of extending the thermodynamic derivation of the einstein equation to all observers who are accelerating locally would be explored here . for this",
    ", one needs a prescription to determine both the increase in entropy and heat energy . to be able to do this , a geometric structure has to be identified , to which , one could assign thermodynamic properties . in the case considered by jacobson ,",
    "the rindler horizon served this purpose . however , locally one can always find a class of accelerating observers , who see a given null hypersurface as the rindler horizon .",
    "moreover , as padmanabhan and paranjape has showed @xcite , one can derive the dynamical equations of gravity by assigning an entropy functional to such a null hypersurface .",
    "in fact , using the einstein equation , it is possible to write down the dynamics of such null hypersurfaces in the form of navier - stokes equation @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "all this suggests that such null hypersurfaces are the natural choice for the generalisation sought here .",
    "accordingly , we choose the null hypersurfaces within the local patch to determine the increase in entropy and heat .",
    "the change in entropy is assumed to be proportional to the change in the area of the cross section of the null boundary of the local patch .",
    "this may seem somewhat similar in spirit to the estimation of the degrees of freedom in a causal diamond according to the holographic principle@xcite .    how to determine the increase in the amount of heat energy is less apparent , however .",
    "a proposal is made here , which leads to a prescription , that could be used to compute @xmath1 .",
    "the main idea here is that a fraction of the matter - energy passing through a null hypersurface gets converted into heat in a locally accelerating frame .",
    "when the null surface is not a horizon , the fraction of matter - energy that gets converted would be typically very small .",
    "two criteria have been used to arrive at such a prescription to determine @xmath1 .",
    "+ 1 ) when evaluated using this prescription , @xmath3 should give the einstein equation .",
    "+ 2 ) when used to compute @xmath1 for the matter - energy passing through the horizon for a locally rindler - like observer , the prescription should be able to produce the standard result .",
    "+ the main point in our paper then is the proposal that just like matter - energy passing through the horizon becomes heat energy and increases the entropy , in an accelerating frame , matter - energy passing through the null hypersurfaces within a local patch , could also result in the increase of heat and entropy by a tiny amount .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the einstein equation is derived from thermodynamic considerations . in the third section , we show that how a person at rest in a locally accelerating frame sees a thermal environment . in the final section , the implications of this result are discussed .",
    "we now demonstrate how the einstein equation can be derived from thermodynamic considerations . for this",
    ", we have to choose a local neighbourhood around some spacetime point @xmath8 in an arbitrary spacetime . after defining the local patch properly and then introducing an inertial and an accelerating coordinate system covering it",
    ", we can proceed with the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "we can now consider a causal diamond @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] ) around the point @xmath8 , sufficiently small , so that one can neglect the effects of the curvature of the spacetime within it .",
    "one can construct a c.s . with a minkowski metric in this patch .",
    "anybody at rest or in uniform motion in this c.s . can be thought of as an inertial observer .",
    "now we consider an observer moving with a constant acceleration @xmath0 in this local patch .",
    "one can also construct a c.s . within this causal diamond ,",
    "in which the accelerating observer is at rest .",
    "we now choose the boundaries of @xmath9 to be the null boundaries of the local patch , where the observer resides .",
    "this can be done in the following way .",
    "first , let us consider the local observer to be such that he or she could typically measure lengths or time differences much smaller than the size of the local patch .",
    "suppose that the size of @xmath9 is of order @xmath5 .",
    "then the length scale associated with the local observers would be much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "this can be achieved by rescaling the coordinates by a factor @xmath10 for the local observers such that @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the size of @xmath9 is now of the order of @xmath12 in the rescaled units of the local observers .",
    "if one takes @xmath10 to be sufficiently large , @xmath12 would also be a very large quantity . in that case",
    ", one may think of the size of the local patch to be as large as possible or practically infinity as far as the local observers are concerned .",
    "one can take only such null hypersurfaces as the null boundary of this local patch , which are themselves at a distance of order @xmath12 away from any point in it .",
    "the choice is also made in such a way that the boundaries are null geodesics .",
    "such a construction is shown in fig .",
    "it represents only the @xmath13 part and the other two space dimensions have been suppressed .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the local patch around the point @xmath8 .",
    "let , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 but @xmath18 and @xmath5 are both of the same order .",
    "this means that the local minkowskian patch can be extended to cover the whole of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the world line of an observer locally accelerating with acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "one can draw null geodesics from any point in this patch , which intersects the causal diamond @xmath20 surrounding it .",
    "@xmath21 is such a null geodesic .",
    "the affine distance along such null geodesics from any point in @xmath14 to @xmath20 is of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "measured in the scale of the local observer , this distance would be very large .",
    "in other words , for a local observer within @xmath14 , the boundary of the causal diamond @xmath9 is very far away .",
    "so @xmath9 can be taken as the null boundary of such an observer .",
    "admittedly , such a choice of the null boundary is arbitrary to an extent .",
    "there is however an upper limit to the arbitrariness as the size of @xmath9 has to be much less than the scale fixed by the curvature of the spacetime .",
    "so two such choices of the null boundary can not be removed from each other by a distance greater than the order @xmath5 .",
    "locally constructed causal diamond @xmath9 in the @xmath13 space , width=302 ]    the velocity vector field of the accelerating observers , is denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "let , the unit vector along the direction of acceleration be denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "such an observer is at rest in the accelerating frame @xmath25 .",
    "if we denote the coordinates in this frame by @xmath26 , the energy flux 3-vector is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "now , in the frame @xmath25 , @xmath29 , where @xmath0 denotes the spacelike indices .    since one can neglect the curvature effects inside the causal diamond @xmath9 , a timelike killing vector can be defined there .",
    "we further demand that the c.s . in @xmath30 frame",
    "is such that there exists a timelike killing vector , @xmath31 , parallel to @xmath32 .",
    "also @xmath31 can be written as @xmath33 and it satisfies the relation @xmath34 a priori , it is not obvious whether such a condition could be made to satisfy around any spacetime point @xmath8 .",
    "however , we are going to show later that this is indeed the case , i.e. such a construction is possible around any spacetime point @xmath8 .",
    "it would also turn out that in this construction , the metric is of the same form as in the rest frame of any locally accelerating observer . to simplify the form of the metric",
    ", we are now going to make some further assumptions .",
    "first , we choose it to be of the form , @xmath35 , where @xmath30 and @xmath36 can run from 1 to 2 .",
    "we also demand that @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "two points should be noted here .",
    "firstly , the direction corresponding to the vector @xmath39 is being singled out .",
    "this is because the observer is accelerating along this direction . in other words , @xmath40 is chosen to be parallel to the acceleration vector @xmath41 .",
    "the second point is that we are also assuming that the velocity vector field does not change as we move along the other two spacelike directions within the local patch .",
    "we shall now determine the form of the metric in the c.s .",
    "of @xmath30 .",
    "this will also demonstrate that can always be satisfied up to first order within the local patch that we have been considering .",
    "the acceleration vector @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 the norm of @xmath43 is denoted as @xmath44 since @xmath45 is parallel to the killing vector @xmath46 , we also have @xmath47 denoting the proper time along the trajectory of the accelerated observer by @xmath48 , we can write @xmath49 where we have used the fact that @xmath22 is a unit vector and also the killing equation for @xmath43 . from the killing equation",
    ", one also gets @xmath50 and using , @xmath51 this fixes the @xmath52 component of the metric . to fix the other components",
    ", we note that @xmath53 . then using",
    ", we get @xmath54 this fixes the metric to be of the form , @xmath55 since @xmath56 and @xmath57 are orthogonal to each other , using the killing equation , it follows that @xmath58 from and , one gets @xmath59 .",
    "this equation implies @xmath60 where , @xmath61 , is the projection operator on surfaces orthogonal to @xmath62 and @xmath63 is an arbitrary function of @xmath64 . to fix @xmath65",
    ", we take the trace on both the sides of and obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the extrinsic curvature scalar of the two dimensional hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath24 .",
    "to determine @xmath65 , we contract by @xmath68 .",
    "this gives @xmath69 .",
    "putting it back in , we have @xmath70 it is interesting to note that the acceleration and hence also the temperature seen by the accelerating observer comes out to be the extrinsic curvature scalar of the two dimensional spacelike hypersurface orthogonal to the direction of acceleration .",
    "another point should also be mentioned here .",
    "near the event horizon of a black hole and also near the rindler horizon , the null vector normal to the horizon and the stationary killing vector obeys a relation similar to the one between @xmath24 and the timelike killing vector @xmath31 , as given by .",
    "however , at the horizon , the stationary killing vector itself becomes a null vector normal to the horizon .",
    "now , we shall show that given a spacetime , locally it is always possible to construct such a c.s .. for this , let us first consider the null geodesics in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "they are given by @xmath71    we define the null coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath74 denoting the @xmath13 part of the metric by @xmath75 , we have @xmath76 now we are going to use the condition that the metric is being determined only in a local patch . using the fact that @xmath77 and @xmath78 and ignoring the second order terms , one gets @xmath79 and @xmath80 . from the new expressions of @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ", it is possible to write @xmath81 .",
    "we also note that within this scheme of approximation , can be expressed as @xmath82 in what follows , we shall freely interchange the exponential functions of the variables @xmath72,@xmath73,@xmath83 and @xmath84 with their polynomial forms approximated up to the appropriate order in these variables .",
    "such manipulations do not lead to any inconsistency , as long as we keep in mind that they represent the functions ( like exponentials ) only up to a given order in these variables .",
    "one can then express as @xmath85 .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath86 where @xmath87 this brings the @xmath13 part of the metric to a minkowskian form .",
    "as there is no constraint on the @xmath88 part of the metric , it can always be brought to an euclidean form .",
    "it should be noted here that in the above analysis , we have always made the approximations in such a way , so that the metric contains terms only up to first order .",
    "gives the relation between the two sets of null coordinates locally , and they contain terms up to second order .",
    "establishes two things .",
    "firstly , we note that up to the first order , locally it is always possible to transform from the c.s . in the @xmath30 frame defined by us to one",
    "in which the metric is minkowskian and vice versa . as it is always possible to express the metric locally(i.e .",
    "up to the first order ) in a minkowskian form , this demonstrates that the assumptions made by us about the properties of the killing vectors defined locally and so on are justified .",
    "the second point is that the relation between the null coordinates in the minkowskian frame and the accelerating frame @xmath30 can be expressed in a form similar to that between the rindler c.s . and minkowskian one up to second order in @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we are now in a position to proceed to the thermodynamic analysis .",
    "the basic idea is very simple . for a causal diamond constructed locally in the way described earlier ,",
    "the increase in gravitational entropy is assumed to be proportional to the amount of increase in the area of the cross - section of the null geodesic congruences along the properly specified part of the null boundaries of the causal diamond .",
    "a certain fraction of the energy flux crossing this diamond is assumed to be converted into heat .",
    "the amount of heat generated and the increase of the entropy are then related via the relation , @xmath89 . plugging in the expressions for these quantities ,",
    "the einstein equation is expected to follow .",
    "the most important point on which , the construction given here differs from that in jacobson s paper @xcite , is in determining the amount of heat generated . in jacobson s",
    "construction , the rindler horizon constitutes a part of the boundary of the locally constructed causal patch . the energy flux passing through the horizon is then taken to be the amount of energy that gets transformed into heat .",
    "the justification for this choice comes from many facts .",
    "the fact that thermodynamic laws are satisfied by the rindler - like horizon itself provides strong support for this .",
    "also , within the membrane paradigm , one finds further evidence in support of such a view .",
    "the horizon acts like an absolute screen for the accelerating observer , who can not observe the degrees of freedom outside the horizon .",
    "so it makes sense to interpret the energy crossing the horizon as heat energy .",
    "but for the causal diamond that we are considering , the null boundaries do not constitute an absolute screen in the sense a horizon does .",
    "it only demarcates an effective boundary of a local patch , where one can define a stationary killing vector up to first order accuracy .",
    "so we need a new prescription or method to determine the increase in heat energy .",
    "moreover , such a prescription should also be able to do two things .",
    "firstly , it should be able to reproduce the einstein equation .",
    "it should also be able to include the fact that the rindler - like observer sees the energy passing through the horizon as heat .",
    "such a prescription is proposed below .",
    "+ _ in a locally accelerating frame , there exists a heat flux due to gravity which heats up the null surfaces within the local patch .",
    "let , @xmath90 be the change in the stationary killing vector @xmath43 , due to the non - inertial motion of the observer as one moves orthogonally across any null hypersurface within this patch .",
    "then @xmath90 gives rise to a heat flux given by @xmath91 .",
    "the total amount of heat generated in this way in a locally accelerating frame , can be computed using this prescription .",
    "_    it is easily seen that this prescription gives the desired expression for the increase in heat energy in the case considered by jacobson @xcite . in that case , the amount of matter - energy crossing the horizon , that is converted into heat in the frame of the rindler observer , can be determined by using it .",
    "the coordinate system of the accelerating observer , which is locally rindler , breaks down at the causal boundary , i.e. the rindler horizon .",
    "hence , the change in the stationary killing vector or the boost killing vector as one crosses the horizon is taken to be equal to @xmath43 itself .",
    "this gives the standard expression for the increase in heat in this case .    with this",
    ", we are in a position to derive the einstein equation .",
    "first , let us focus on the amount of energy that would be converted into heat in the locally accelerated frame according to the prescription outlined above .",
    "let , @xmath92 be the tangent vector to a null geodesic .",
    "since both @xmath68 and @xmath24 are constant vector fields within @xmath9 , one can write @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the amount by which @xmath84 changes along the null geodesic",
    ". this formula would be useful while performing integrations along null geodesics .    now according to the above discussion",
    ", the heat flux is to be computed from the change in @xmath43 as one moves across a null hypersurface orthogonally and also it is the null hypersurfaces that heat up in this process .",
    "so it would be convenient if we first decide on what are the null hypersurfaces that we have to take into account to determine the total heat increase as seen by the observer . from the form of the metric",
    ", it is clear that the killing vector @xmath43 does not change as we move within the @xmath95 subspace .",
    "hence we need to consider only the null hypersurfaces within the @xmath96 subspace .",
    "these are a series of @xmath97 and @xmath98 hypersurfaces , which crisscross each other within the causal diamond .",
    "now , within @xmath9 , there is a change in @xmath43 as we move across one such @xmath97 surface and also across one such @xmath98 surface .",
    "this means that we have to add the heat fluxes due to these two sets of null surfaces .",
    "since each null hypersurface gets heated up by the resultant heat flux , we have to compute the total amount of increase in heat by multiplying this heat flux with the appropriate volume form for each set of null surfaces and then adding them up .    to compute the amount of heat increase",
    ", we can start from the null surface @xmath99 , which is a surface on which @xmath97 . now starting from this null surface ,",
    "we want to move across other @xmath97 surfaces towards the center of @xmath9 , i.e. in the direction @xmath84 decreases . for this purpose ,",
    "we choose the null vector @xmath100 normal to @xmath97 hypersurfaces , where @xmath101 .",
    "the part of the heat flux generated due to the change of @xmath43 across @xmath97 surfaces is given by @xmath102 , where , @xmath103 .",
    "the total heat energy flux is given by , @xmath104 , where , @xmath105 is the appropriate null vector normal to @xmath98 surfaces and @xmath106 .",

    "this fixes @xmath110 .",
    "any @xmath111 surface gets heated up due to the sum of the heat fluxes which are proportional to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the @xmath98 null surfaces heat up in the same way",
    ". one can find out the total amount of increase in heat energy by adding up the contributions of all these four parts .",
    "they are given by + @xmath114 , + @xmath115 , + @xmath116 , + @xmath117 , + where , @xmath103 and @xmath118 and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the affine parameters along the null geodesics , the tangent vectors to which are @xmath100 and @xmath105 respectively . also @xmath119 is the area element of the cross section of the null hypersurfaces of the causal diamond .",
    "the volume element @xmath120 is being used as we want to determine the total heat energy transferred to the null surfaces orthogonal to @xmath121 within the causal diamond . from",
    ", we have @xmath122 and @xmath123 and also similar relations for @xmath124 and @xmath125 . using them ,",
    "the total amount of increase in heat energy can be expressed as @xmath126 where the relations @xmath127 and @xmath128 have also been used . using , and using @xmath84 and @xmath129 interchangeably(since @xmath78 ) , one can express the amount of heat increase as @xmath130 one important point to note here is that the amount of the increase in heat energy depends upon the fact that it is the null surfaces that are being heated up .",
    "this is a characteristic property of the gravitational heating process that is being considered here .",
    "as seen here , it has physical consequences .",
    "now we consider the right hand side of the equation , @xmath131 .",
    "the temperature @xmath132 is taken to be proportional to the acceleration @xmath0 .",
    "the justification for this is provided in the next section . assuming the gravitational entropy to be holographic and taking a cue from black hole thermodynamics , the increase in entropy @xmath2 is taken to be proportional to the increase of the area of the cross section of the null boundary of the diamond .",
    "this null boundary can be thought of as being constituted of two wedges and we consider the area increase along one of the wedges .",
    "our calculation of the increase of the area of the cross section closely follows the one performed by jacobson @xcite .",
    "however , there are some important points , on which our method differs from his .",
    "these would be pointed out as we go along .",

    "they are chosen in such a way that for both the congruences , @xmath134 and @xmath135 vanish at @xmath136 . now matter - energy passes through both the sides @xmath99 and @xmath109 of the null wedge .",

    "the fact that the sign of the change in the area of the null congruences is opposite along the sides @xmath99 and @xmath109 implies that the change in this area along the boundary of the causal diamond does not increase monotonically with time in the locally accelerating frame .",
    "instead , it increases first till the time slices evolve up to the hypersurface @xmath143 and then start decreasing .",
    "this means that even though the entropy is proportional to the total change in the area of the null congruences along the null boundary , within the causal diamond itself , one can not assign it to be proportional to the incremental change in area with time . in other words , using this prescription , one can only determine the total entropy increase in the causal diamond @xmath9 as a whole .",
    "this feature of the entropy as defined here contrasts strikingly with that of the horizon entropy , which increases monotonically , once a particular type of of teleological boundary condition has been assumed . using this prescription",

    "in this section , it is shown how , an observer at rest in a locally accelerating frame , would encounter a thermal environment . before proceeding with the analysis ,",
    "the notion of the locally accelerating observer has to be made more precise .",
    "specifically , the key feature distinguishing any such observer is that the scales at which she could make a measurement is much smaller than the size of the local patch .",
    "it would also be assumed that the physics at this smaller scale would be local up to a very good approximation , i.e. it would not be influenced by physics at a scale , which is much larger than the size of the local patch . for the patch that we are considering , it is also possible to transform from the c.s .",
    "in which the accelerating observer is at rest to the c.s .",
    "in which the inertial observer is at rest .",
    "since local observers can observe physics at a much smaller scale than the size of this patch , it can be treated as the minkowski spacetime as far as they are concerned .",
    "these considerations should hold in both these frames up to a very good approximation .",
    "now , it would be further assumed that within these approximations , the inertial observer is going to see a state analogous to a vacuum state in the minkowski spacetime in the inertial frame .",
    "so one has to construct such states .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "first , one focuses on a particular wave equation of a free field , like the wave equation for the massless scalar field .",
    "then one tries to build fock states by taking into account only the short wavelength modes associated with the local patch or in other words , by excluding the wave modes which are of wavelength larger than the size of the local patch . in this approximate sense",
    ", one can talk about the different fock states associated with this local patch .",
    "the assumption made here is that that the inertial observer associated with this local patch would not detect any particles , i.e. the inertial observer finds the field to be in the vacuum state . in a similar way ,",
    "it is also possible to construct the fock states using the short wavelength modes associated with the local patch for the observers , who are accelerating .",
    "what will be shown here is that in this case , those accelerating observers find themselves in a thermal environment .    to deal with the wave modes , which are much smaller than the size of the local patch that we have been considering ,",
    "let us define the quantities , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "these are just the rescaled time and space coordinates .",
    "the rescaling factor is a constant @xmath10 , chosen in such a way , that @xmath174 , where @xmath5 is the size of the patch .",
    "this can be thought of as introducing very small units of length , which the observer is using to measure length and time , i.e. the length resolution power of the local observers is much higher .",
    "the value of any quantity after such a rescaling of the coordinates is going to be denoted here by the suffix s. the value of the acceleration after such a rescaling becomes @xmath175 .",
    "this means that in the rescaled units , @xmath176 .",
    "apart from being multiplied by a constant factor , the metric retains the same form in the accelerated frame after the rescaling of the coordinates .",
    "we consider only the @xmath96 part of the metric here . apart from a constant factor",
    ", it can be written as @xmath177 one can now define @xmath178 and @xmath179 , which are of exactly the same form as in with only @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 replacing @xmath0 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively .",
    "consequently , can be written as @xmath183 in the same way as was deduced .",

    ", we shall consider a free massless scalar field @xmath190 here . within the scheme of approximation outlined above",
    ", one can expand @xmath191 in terms of the orthonormal modes as @xmath192 .",

    "\\label{modeexpaccn}\\ ] ] the modes denoted by @xmath195 are just the plane wave modes in the minkowskian spacetime .",
    "however one needs to look at the modes denoted by @xmath196 in the accelerated frame more carefully . the wave equation for the massless scalar field @xmath190",
    "can be written down in the accelerated frame as @xmath197 at this point , it is important to realise that the term proportional to @xmath180 in the l.h.s .",
    "of is going to be much smaller in magnitude than the other terms , since @xmath176 .",
    "then one can treat this term as a perturbation to the free scalar field wave equation in minkowski spacetime in the inertial frame .",
    "if the wave equation is then solved as a perturbation series order by order , then at the zeroeth order , reduces to the standard wave equation in the inertial frame . the general solution to",
    "it can be written as a fourier series of the plane wave modes .",
    "even when one solves the equation in the first order , one can express the general solution as a fourier series in terms of the same plane wave modes . up to first order then , these plane wave modes constitute a complete orthonormal basis for .",
    "this fact is going to be used in the analysis that follows . that these plane wave modes from an orthonormal set is a well known fact and will be assumed as such .",
    "alternatively , this also follows from the fact that can be expressed in the form @xmath198 in terms of the null coordinates @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "an equation of the form has plane wave modes as solutions [ see @xcite ] .",
    "it should be emphasised here that it is only within a scheme of approximation , that these wave modes could be taken to form an eigenbasis in both the frames .",
    "the size of the patch being considered is of the order @xmath12 .",
    "so one can solve the massless klein - gordon equation with periodic boundary conditions in a box of size @xmath12 .",
    "then the wavenumbers are discrete and given by @xmath199 , where @xmath84 belongs to the set of all positive integers . now instead of taking the limit of @xmath12 going to infinity , we just consider the case when @xmath12 is very large . then we can replace the discrete wavemodes by the continuous ones up to a very good approximation .",
    "it is only within this approximation that the operators @xmath0 and @xmath200 are to be defined and the commutation relation between them would hold . in fact , in the commutation relation between @xmath0 and @xmath200 , the right hand side can be thought of as a properly weighted sum of the discrete wave modes , which is a good approximation to a dirac delta function , when @xmath12 is very large .",
    "however , one can also scale the @xmath64s to get rid of the factor @xmath5 and absorb it within @xmath0 and @xmath200 as it is a constant factor .",
    "after that , only @xmath10 , which is a very large number , remains in the denominator of the wave number .",
    "then arguing in the same way as before , one can approximate this sum as a dirac delta function .",
    "once the basis sets have been constructed in both the frames , we can ask the question , _ what state does the vacuum state in the inertial frame correspond to in the accelerated frame?_. this can be answered by calculating the bogulobov coefficients pertaining to this case .",
    "we shall now calculate these coefficients by closely following a similar calculation done by visser _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "a similar approach has also been followed in @xcite .",
    "the bolgulobov coefficients are given by @xmath201    and    @xmath202    the integrals are over any arbitrary spacelike hypersurface within the local patch and extends at least till the boundary of the local patch .",
    "this can be thought of as the analogue of a spacelike hypersurface terminating at the spacelike infinity in a minkowskian spacetime .",
    "in fact , as we have argued earlier , once we rescale the coordinates , the local patch can be treated as minkowskian up to a very good approximation .",
    "this implies that in our case also , the bogulobov coefficients are lorentz invariant and hence do not depend on the hypersurface on which they are evaluated .",
    "the frequencies @xmath203 and @xmath204 correspond to the frequency of the wave modes in the accelerated frame and in the inertial frame respectively . in this case",
    ", it is convenient to evaluate them on a spacelike hypersurface arbitrarily close to the future null boundary of the local patch that we have been considering .",
    "this means that we have to integrate over both a @xmath205 and a @xmath206 surface . since we have chosen the @xmath196 modes as the basis , the integrand vanishes on the @xmath206 surface .",
    "hence , for the coefficient @xmath207 , we get @xmath208\\partial_{u_s } exp[-i\\bar{\\omega}\\bar{u}_s ]                                       - exp[-i\\bar{\\omega}\\bar{u}_s]\\partial_{u_s } exp[-i\\omega u_s]\\ } ,   \\label{beta1}\\ ] ] where , @xmath209 is the range of @xmath178 . @xmath210 and @xmath211 are both of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "the first term can be integrated by parts giving rise to a surface term proportional to @xmath212exp[-i\\bar{\\omega}\\bar{u}_s]\\textbar^{u_{s+}}_{u_{s-}}$ ] , which would be discarded .",

    "\\label{beta3}\\ ] ] it is important to keep in mind that in , we have made use of the relation between @xmath186 and @xmath178 , where the exponential function is used only as an approximation .",
    "this can also be seen from the constraint , @xmath215 , that has to be satisfied .",
    "this constraint implies that even though @xmath178 becomes very large , @xmath216 would always have a value close to @xmath217 .    now changing the variable from @xmath178 to @xmath218 , where @xmath219 can be expressed as @xmath220 as has just been mentioned , the constraint forces both @xmath221 and @xmath222 to be close to @xmath217 .",
    "let us define a variable , @xmath223 .",
    "then the exponent in the integrand can be expressed as @xmath224 .",
    "the first factor does not depend on @xmath225 and can be taken out of the integral .",
    "@xmath225 would range from @xmath226 to @xmath227 where @xmath228 .",
    "now the factor @xmath229 in the exponent of the integrand is very large .",
    "this means that the frequency of the waveform in the integrand is very high . in other words ,",
    "the waveform varies very rapidly and so one can extend the range of integration from @xmath230 to @xmath231 .",
    "extending the range of the integration contributes very little to the integral and can be neglected .",
    "one can go back to express the integral again in terms of @xmath218 as the variable and the range of integration is now extended from @xmath226 to @xmath232 .",
    "this is a crucial step in this derivation of the thermal spectra .",
    "as we shall see , the possibility of the extension of the integration range allows us to express the integral as a complete gamma function .",
    "this leads to a thermal spectrum .",
    "the extension of the range of the integration was possible because @xmath176 .",
    "another point to remember is that to obtain the thermal spectra , we need not take the limit @xmath233 .",
    "the approximation to a thermal spectra is good enough for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "this means that the rescaling of the coordinates in the local patch is directly responsible for the appearance of the familiar thermal weight factor . from a more physical perspective , the thermal nature is resulting from the fact that the observer sees only local physics , i.e. the wave modes that are being observed are localised within the patch we have been considering .",

    "this is of the order of the size of the local patch , we have been considering .",
    "this means that the temperature of the radiation is not a good observable quantity that could be measured by the observer in the local patch .",
    "in fact , the local observer can not detect whether the radiation is in thermal equilibrium or not .",
    "hence it is not possible for the observer while remaining inside the local patch , to find out whether the state he is seeing is a thermal state or not .",
    "however , if the observer focuses on the localised modes or the higher energy modes , then he would find that these follow a maxwell - boltzmann spectrum , which is what the planck spectrum tends to for the modes with energy much higher than the energy scale given by the temperature .",

    "so , the observer accelerating locally would find the amount of the energy that is being converted into heat to be greater , if the components of the riemann curvature tensor at that point in spacetime is greater in magnitude .",
    "this suggests that the local observer perceives the amount of heat generated by gravity to be greater , when gravity is stronger .",
    "it is also important to note that the way @xmath2 was calculated for the causal diamond @xmath9 , tells us only about the total entropy increase .",
    "but it does not tell us how @xmath2 is changing with time within the local patch .",
    "this is not surprising since we solved the raychaudhury equation with a different boundary condition instead of the standard teleological condition used to prove the second law for the horizons .",
    "it is not clear at this moment , how one can prove some version of the second law of thermodynamics in this case .",
    "finally , we also demonstrate here that a locally accelerating observer encounters a thermal environment with a temperature proportional to the value of her acceleration .",
    "this holds provided one is observing local physics only .",
    "this is reminiscent of the unruh effect and also technically the calculation is very similar .",
    "however , there is a very important difference . in the case",
    "considered here , the locally accelerating observer does not observe thermal radiation at the temperature @xmath180 for the obvious reason that the lengthscale corresponding to this temperature is much greater than the size of the local patch containing her .",
    "but any detector in her rest frame , interacting with much more localised modes of the radiation , would detect a thermal environment , the energy distribution in this case is found to be given by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution .",
    "this also means that the state seen by the observer need not be a thermal one .",
    "this is different from the unruh effect , in which case the state seen by the unruh observer is thermal .",
    "but in the case dealt with here , it is not possible for local observers to stay within the local patch and also determine whether the state seen by them is thermal or not .",
    "all they can do is determine the weights of the different energy - states ( these are different from the quantum state of the field ) and that comes out to be @xmath293 $ ] .",
    "this justifies the assignment of a temperature proportional to @xmath0 in the locally accelerating frame .",
    "a point can be made that how much significance should one attach to this result given that the state seen by the local observer may not be thermal .",
    "the point of view taken here is that the environment is indeed thermal as far as the local observers are concerned .",
    "also the fact that it is possible to derive the einstein equation from thermodynamic relations in this case lends some support to it . taken together",
    ", they give credence to the view that for any locally accelerating observer , the dynamics of gravity can be viewed as a thermodynamic process .    the temperature measured by the observer goes to zero as the acceleration @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "the observer for whom @xmath294 , is falling freely in that local patch .",
    "so , it is possible for any observer who is not falling freely to view the einstein equation locally as a manifestation of thermodynamic changes in a system . in this sense ,",
    "the result presented here is a generalisation of jacobson s derivation of einstein equation from thermodynamics to the case of any non - freely falling observer .",
    "a freely falling observer in that same local patch does not detect any temperature or the heating up of null surfaces by gravity .",
    "this is similar to the difference that exists between a rindler - like observer and an inertial observer or between an observer freely falling through the black hole horizon vis - a - vis one who remains outside .",
    "a final remark is in order here . due to the equivalence principle",
    ", the above considerations would apply to any observer in a locally constant gravitational field as well .",
    "i am greatly indebted to sudipta sarkar for helping me understand many issues in horizon thermodynamics and also in jacobson s paper .",
    "i am also grateful to ghanashyam date for the long discussions and the detailed comments , helpful suggestions and clarifications he made on the third section of the paper .",
    "alok laddha has also been very helpful with several comments and important suggestions .",
    "i would also like to thank kinjalk lochan and satyabrata sahu for discussions , which encouraged me to look at this problem .",
    "a p balachandran had made some helpful comments at an earlier stage .",
    "thanks are also due to gaurav narain and saurav gupta for helpful discussions and suggestions .",
    "last , but not the least , i am grateful to sudipto palchowdhury for keeping his patience throughout our discussions related to this work ."
