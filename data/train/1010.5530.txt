    "the supernova ( sn ) 2006gy discovered by robert quimby in august 2006 has challenged our understanding of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "sn 2006gy was 100 times more luminous than a typical sn and at the time the most energetic ever recorded . for almost a year",
    "it continued to radiate at a pace in which an ordinary sn could only sustain for at most a few days . explaining this tremendous energy budget pushes the limits of current sn theory .",
    "sn 2006gy reveals many singular features in both its light curve ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ obs ] ) and hydrogen spectrum ( right panel of fig . [ obs ] ) .",
    "the light curve exhibits a luminous peak , broad shape and energetic plateau while the hydrogen spectrum displays a curious evolution and a peculiar structure .",
    "models have been proposed to describe individual characteristics of this event but all have been left wanting .",
    "the significance of sn 2006gy was first discussed independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model proposed by @xcite involved a type ia sn exploding during the common envelope phase of a binary system .",
    "the collision between the sn ejecta ( sne ) and dense circum - stellar material ( csm ) releases the amount of energy required to explain the observations of sn 2006gy .",
    "however this model demands the csm to be extraordinarily massive @xcite suggesting a mass loss rate several orders of magnitude greater than expected @xcite .",
    "in addition the spectrum of sn 2006gy indicates the presence of elements not seen in a type ia sn @xcite .",
    "@xcite championed a csm model which considered a wind from an exotic luminous blue variable ( lbv ) to account for the massive csm .",
    "although this model can account for the first five months of the observed light curve , the diffusion process requires a rapid drop off in luminosity @xcite rather than the observed plateau .",
    "attempts to reconcile the csm model with the late stage plateau invoke the decay of radioactive @xmath3ni and @xmath3co to generate the needed luminosity .",
    "this necessitates 10 to 27 times the maximum amount of @xmath3ni that can be created by a sn @xcite .",
    "this description for the late stage light curve of sn 2006gy has been rebuked by recent near - infrared observations which show that the decline in luminosity is inconsistent with @xmath3co decay @xcite .",
    "a further challenge to the csm model lies in the fact that a high mass - loss rate is deduced using an equation that requires the stellar wind to be constant in time ; however the conclusion made by @xcite is that the stellar wind must vary with time , contradicting their initial assumptions @xcite . for this model to achieve the amount of radiated energy observed in sn 2006gy",
    ", the initial kinetic energy of the sne must be at least @xmath4 erg .",
    "this implies that sn 2006gy was one of the most energetic sne and requires a massive ( @xmath5 ) csm cloud @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the transformation of kinetic energy into radiation should translate into substantial narrowing of the h@xmath0 line as the fast moving ejecta slows , which is contrary to that observed .",
    "finally any model that involves the collision of sne with a dense csm should be a strong emitter of x - ray radiation since the shock temperature would be very high @xcite .",
    "observations from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ of sn 2006gy have seen very limited x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the csm model explains the lack of x - rays through self - absorption by the cold , outer layers of the csm @xcite .",
    "a pulsational pair - instability ( ppisn ) model for sn 2006gy was considered by @xcite . in this model",
    "an unusually massive star ( @xmath6 m@xmath7 ) becomes prone to the @xmath8 instability , triggering a sn explosion .",
    "the pair - instability process must occur twice , leading to a collision between ejected shells which releases the energy needed for sn 2006gy . in order to reach the peak luminosity , it was necessary for @xcite to artificially increase the kinetic energy of the second ejection . like the csm model",
    ", the ppisn model fails to achieve on several levels .",
    "first it is unable to properly account for the light curve plateau , as it falls off too rapidly @xcite .",
    "@xcite explain that the extra energy required to fit the plateau must by generated by radioactive decay of @xmath3co , a conclusion contradicted by late stage near - infrared observations @xcite .",
    "secondly , the multi - component structure of the h@xmath0 line is difficult to reconcile with the ppisn model which demands all the hydrogen to be contained in an outer shell @xcite .",
    "thirdly , a progenitor star of 110 @xmath9 is required for the ppisn model to achieve the power output of sn 2006gy .",
    "a star this massive is expected to lose its hydrogen long before it goes sn @xcite . in order for numerical simulations to create a massive star with sufficient hydrogen",
    "the merger of several young high mass stars was required @xcite .",
    "this type of run - away stellar merger would be common in the early universe but atypical 240 million years ago @xcite , at the era of the sn 2006gy explosion .",
    "in this paper we present the quark nova as an alternative explanation for sn 2006gy .",
    "section 2 describes the physics of the interaction between the supernova envelope and quark nova ejecta . in section 3 ,",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic fits of the quark nova model to observations of sn 2006gy are presented .",
    "section 4 provides a discussion of other observations of sn 2006gy which are consistent with the quark nova model .",
    "finally a conclusion is presented section 5 and future work discussed in section 6 .",
    "the quark nova ( qn ) was proposed as an alternative explanation for sn 2006gy @xcite .",
    "a qn is expected to occur when the core density of a neutron star reaches the quark de - confinement density and triggers a violent @xcite conversion to the more stable strange quark matter @xcite .",
    "the novel proposition was made that during the spin - down evolution of the neutron star a detonative @xcite phase transition to up - down - strange triplets would eject the outer layers of the neutron star at ultra - relativistic velocities @xcite ( see the first panel of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "follow - up studies of neutrino and photon emission processes during the qn @xcite have shown that these outermost layers ( @xmath10 ) can be ejected with up to @xmath11 erg in kinetic energy .",
    "nucleosynthesis simulations of the evolution of the neutron - rich qn ejecta ( qne ) was found to produce primarily heavy elements with mass number , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if the time ( @xmath13 ) between sn and qn explosions is lengthy the sne will have dissipated such that the qn essentially erupts in isolation . however , when @xmath13 is on the order of days a violent collision occurs reheating the extended sne to a temperature of @xmath14 k @xcite .",
    "the brilliant radiance of the re - shocked sne ( rsne ) fades as the photosphere recedes , eventually revealing a mixture of the inner rsne and the deposited qne material . in this work",
    "we revisit and extend that of @xcite by introducing effects from the qne to both the light curve and spectra of sn 2006gy .",
    "the collision between the qne and sne creates a shock that propagates at a speed @xmath15 through the sne ( see the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] ) .",
    "the shock breaks out of the sne at a distance @xmath16 at time    @xmath17    the rsne which has a mass @xmath18 is therefore fully re - shocked at a radius    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the radius of the progenitor star and @xmath21 is the maximum velocity of the homologously ( @xmath22 ) expanding sne .",
    "the outer edge of the rsne grows as    @xmath23    the core of the spherical rsne will cool adiabatically from its initial shock temperature ( @xmath24 ) as ,    @xmath25    for this proof - of - principle analysis we consider the temperature to follow a power law profile as : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a constant .    to ensure that energy is conserved as continuum radiation",
    "is emitted by the hot rsne ( hrsne ) an equivalent amount of thermal energy is removed .",
    "since the hrsne is optically thick the radiative cooling process starts from the outer edge and a photosphere propagates inward leaving behind a cold outer layer ( crsne ) , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "all species within the crsne are neutral and thus efficient absorbers of high energy radiation . while we leave a rigorous treatment of x - ray absorption for future work , modelling column density of the crsne ( see fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] ) yields an explanation for why _ chandra _ observations show suppressed x - ray production by sn 2006gy @xcite .",
    "the qn explosion sends ejecta propelling through space at speeds approaching c. the ejecta will eventually catch up to and collide with the sne material and mix at the inner edge of the rsne .",
    "the resulting composite shell will be referred to as the hot plate ( hp ) which has a constant thickness @xmath28 .",
    "conservation of momentum tells us the hp will coast once it has captured all the sne material it is capable of sweeping up .",
    "the final momentum of the hp will be equal to the momentum of the qne plus that of all the sne material ( represented by a velocity space integral ) swept into the hp :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the energy of the qne , @xmath31 is the mass of the hp and @xmath32 is the final coasting speed of the hp .",
    "assuming homologous expansion ( @xmath33 ) and a constant density ( @xmath34 ) the mass interior to velocity v is :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the total mass of the progenitor and @xmath37 is the velocity at the outer edge of the sne .",
    "substituting equation [ eq : msne ] into [ eq : mhpvhp ] and solving for the velocity of the hp gives :    @xmath38    and using equation [ eq : vhp ] in [ eq : msne ] , assuming @xmath39 , we have :    @xmath40    several factors such as gravitational braking , reverse shocks and mixing will lead to lower @xmath32 values than that given by equation [ eq : vhp ] .",
    "a lower limit for @xmath32 is given by the escape speed @xmath41 at the initial radius of the hp , @xmath42 .",
    "the time , @xmath43 , for the hp to form and start coasting can be estimated as follows :    the time taken for the qne to catch up to and sweep up the hp material is @xmath44 , so the radius of the hp at time @xmath43 can be expressed as :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 represents an average speed of the qn ejecta during the catch - up and sweeping phases .",
    "we explored a large range physical parameters of the qne and found that typically the hp enters the coasting phase between @xmath47 and @xmath48 , thus we chose as a fiducial value @xmath49 after which the radius of the hp is described by :    @xmath50      for an adiabatic gas we have :    @xmath51    since the hp is a coasting shell of constant thickness its volume is given by @xmath52 . using @xmath53 with equation [ eq : adiabatic ]",
    "thus gives the temperature as a function of time :    @xmath54    photon diffusion will become important in the cooling of the hp when the hp and the overlying envelope become sufficiently transparent .",
    "we can approximate when this will happen ( @xmath55 ) by setting the mean free path to a fraction of the envelope size :    @xmath56    up to a radius of @xmath57 we assume heating by the hp completely ionizes the hydrogen in the envelope at all times @xmath58 . beyond this , the envelope may or may not be ionized depending on its temperature .",
    "the radius of the envelope at time @xmath55 is given by @xmath59 which leads to ( using equation [ eq : mfp ] ) :    @xmath60    using values of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 we get @xmath65 days . once @xmath55 is reached , diffusion will quickly cool the hp within @xmath66 day .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the hp is able to retain its heat for hundreds of days .",
    "recognition of the sustained high temperature of the hp is essential to deciphering the enigma of sn 2006gy as this naturally describes both the late stage plateau in the light curve and the unyielding broad component of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "radiation from the hp is treated as diffusion luminosity , given by :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the specific heat , @xmath69 is the number density of the hp , @xmath70 represents the temperature difference at the interface between the hp and rsne .",
    "the hp photosphere ( @xmath71 ) defines the emitting surface , which moves at the diffusion rate , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the geometry of our model is quite simple as it contains only three components ; a thin inner shell ( the hp ) surrounded by very thick outer shells ( the hrsne and crsne ) . for our analysis",
    "we use the astrophysical modelling software shape @xcite to build a geometric model of the rsne and hp . alongside being able to quickly and accurately construct 3-d geometries , density and temperature profiles , shape",
    "is able to perform fast radiative transfer calculations .",
    "radiative transfer in shape is accomplished through a ray - casting algorithm .",
    "the aforementioned 3d model is subdivided into a @xmath73-cell grid , with each cell representing a volume ( voxel ) through which radiative transfer is performed .",
    "given a temperature and density distribution , shape calculates emission and absorption coefficients for each voxel in the grid . a ray is then cast from behind the grid to the observer , performing radiative transfer calculations along each voxel for each frequency band .",
    "the emerging ray can then be used in the generation of the light curve and spectrum plots .",
    "this allows us to simultaneously produce light curves and spectra which can then be compared to the observations of sn 2006gy . for this analysis we use rays consisting of 150 bands ranging from @xmath74hz - @xmath75hz .",
    "the plot of the light curve only uses r - band frequencies from @xmath76hz - @xmath77hz , but the energy conservation requires the entire range . for the spectra , we use 200 bands from @xmath78hz - @xmath79hz ( spanning the frequency of h@xmath0 ) .    unlike most radiative transfer codes , shape",
    "does not calculate the temperature of each cell in the grid .",
    "instead , the temperature is an input in the form of an analytic distribution .",
    "although less accurate than a full radiative transfer treatment , the speed gain allows for an interactive parameter search as required by this work . in summary ,",
    "shape answers the question  given a temperature and density , what is the intensity of the light emitted by an object ? \" .",
    "the parameters used to construct the light curve and spectra of sn 2006gy can be divided into three categories : constrained , free physical , and free radiative transfer .",
    "the following parameters that are used in our model are constrained by observations .",
    "* @xmath36 : the total mass ( @xmath80 ) is constrained from above by @xmath81 ( anything heavier will likely form a black hole rather than a neutron star @xcite ) and @xmath82 from below ( anything less massive will not form a quark star @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath21 : the outer edge velocity of the expanding rsne is constrained to be 4000 km@xmath83s@xmath84 by the blue - side absorption feature ( as noted in fig .",
    "[ d96 ] ) observed in the h@xmath0 spectrum @xcite .",
    "* @xmath24 : the initial temperature of the rsne and hp is constrained by fitting the broad component of the h@xmath0 line for each spectrum assuming it is thermally broadened . the extrapolated @xmath24 value is on the order of @xmath8510@xmath86k .",
    "* @xmath15 : the speed of the shock as it travels through the rsne is @xmath876000 km@xmath83s@xmath84 , this is found using shock physics as @xmath88 where the initial temperature ( @xmath24 ) is known .      in our model the sn explosion of a massive star is followed a time @xmath13 later by a qn explosion .",
    "the qne / sne collision sends a shock through the sne creating two distinct layers : the hp and rsne .",
    "the hp has a mass @xmath89 , coasting speed @xmath90 , initial radius @xmath91 and constant thickness @xmath28 .",
    "the rsne has a mass , @xmath18 and temperature profile defined by the power law index , @xmath27 .",
    "we assume constant density for all components .",
    "these variables make up the free physical parameters in our model which we find by fitting our theoretical light curve to the observations of sn 2006gy .",
    "the radiative transfer in shape requires the specification of an absorption and emission coefficient for each frequency , @xmath92 .",
    "the emission coefficient used in this analysis is of the form :    @xmath93    where a is a multiplicative factor . the corresponding absorption coefficient ( assuming lte ) is :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the planck function .",
    "the form of equation [ eq : j ] is similar to that of bound - free continuum emission , perhaps hinting at an emission mechanism .",
    "in addition to the absorption in equation [ eq : kappa ] , we include a thomson scattering term of the form :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the thomson scattering cross section and b is a multiplicative factor . due to the computational and time demands of treating multiple scattering",
    ", we simply assume that scattering is isotropic and everything removed from the beam will eventually be put back in .",
    "of course the scattering is not perfectly elastic and energy will be lost .",
    "therefore b represents the fraction of scattered light that will not be scattered back into the beam .",
    "through the exploration of parameter space using shape , we find that the light curve is well reproduced by a progenitor mass ranging from 20 - 40 @xmath9 .",
    "we have fit three models with progenitor masses of 20 , 30 and 40 @xmath9 with the parameters of each fit listed in table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "each uses an envelope temperature profile of @xmath98 with an initial temperature of @xmath99 .",
    "the initial energy of the qn ejecta is set to @xmath100 ergs @xcite we find that the actual velocity of the hp differs from the theoretical ( equation [ eq : vhp ] ) by a factor of @xmath101 .",
    "as previously mentioned , factors such as gravitational braking , reverse shocks and mixing will lead to lower @xmath32 values .",
    "the emission is simulated using the coefficients of equations [ eq : j ] , [ eq : kappa ] and [ eq : kappa_th ] with the a values listed in table [ table : parameters ] and @xmath102 .",
    "while the shock is still moving through the sne ( @xmath103 ) detailed shock physics would be required to properly describe the corresponding light curve , thus we begin our photometric analysis at time @xmath104 days .",
    "our sn explosion date is 5 , 10 and 20 days earlier than that inferred by @xcite for the 40 , 30 and 20 @xmath9 fits respectively .",
    "figure [ figure : ms ] shows the fits for the various progenitor masses , all of which match the data well .",
    "figure [ lcfit ] shows how the different components contribute to the light curve .",
    "the high initial temperature and radius of the rsne provide ample luminosity ( see the blue dash - dot line in fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] ) to explain the broad peak of the observed light curve .",
    "as the photosphere recedes , radiation from the underlying hp becomes more prominent and the drop in the overall light curve ( red solid line in fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] ) is mitigated by support from the hp ( green dashed line in fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] ) .",
    "the slowly coasting and thus slowly cooling hp provides a natural explanation for the plateau observed in the late stage of the sn 2006gy light curve .      for our proof - of - principle spectroscopic analysis we aimed to determine the cause of the overall structure of the h@xmath0 spectrum of sn 2006gy , as to date",

    "[ schematic ] , after shock break out our model contains three components ; an outer layer of cold rsne ( crsne ) , a hot region of rsne ( hrsne ) and an innermost thin hp shell .",
    "each of these constituents contribute to the overall shape of the h@xmath0 line . for our modelling",
    "we ignore contributions from the two identified [ n ii ] lines at 6548 and 6583 angstroms .    by viewing the width of the broad h@xmath0 component in the light of thermal rather than doppler broadening , the reason for the curious late stage breadth becomes clear .",
    "considering the slowly coasting hp as the thermal source , the width of the broad component is then proportional to t@xmath105 .",

    "[ d96 ] is the broad h@xmath0 component for day 96 ( width @xmath106 k ) .",
    "we determined the temperature evolution of the hp by fitting a gaussian to the broad component of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the decrease in temperature agrees remarkably well with the predicted hp temperature from our light curve ( top - right panel of fig . [ hpprop ] ) .",
    "the peculiar asymmetry of the h@xmath0 line observed in sn 2006gy is inescapable in our scenario .",
    "the wide blue - side absorption feature that does not dip below the continuum is due to rsne material along our line of sight absorbing emission from the underlying hp .",
    "the blue - side feature extends out 4000 km@xmath83s@xmath84 as both the hrsne and crsne contribute to the absorption .",
    "the blue - side absorption is strongest at times prior to day 96 and then becomes weaker as the absorbing rsne material becomes increasingly diffuse and increasingly cool .",

    "[ hafit ] most clearly displays the evolution of the blue - side absorption in our model .    at early times",
    "the narrow h@xmath0 peak is broadened by thermal motion . at some time between day 71 and 96",
    "the temperature of the hrsne drops such that kinematic doppler broadening takes over .",
    "as the location of the h@xmath0 emission region recedes into slower moving rsne material , emission from the hrsne originates from ever lower velocities .",
    "this accounts for the discontinuity in the h@xmath0 line at @xmath107 km@xmath83s@xmath84 on day 96 seen in fig .",
    "however the cold outer layer of the rsne continues to absorb out to 4000 km@xmath83s@xmath84 ( see green dashed line in fig .",

    "125 and 154 is characteristic of an expanding ( velocity @xmath108 km@xmath83s@xmath84 ) shell of hydrogen .",
    "this velocity suggests the sharp p - cygni feature is likely due to stellar wind from the progenitor star .",
    "this feature does not seem to be typical for super - luminous sne as it has not been observed in the super - luminous sne : sn 2008am , @xcite , sn 2008fz @xcite , sn 2003ma @xcite , sn 2008es @xcite or sn 2007bi @xcite .    for illustrative purposes we added an outermost shell of hydrogen to our model in order to simulate a stellar wind ( @xmath109const . ) from the progenitor .",
    "our low mass ( @xmath110 m@xmath7 ) stellar wind extends from the outer edge of the crsne to a radius of 3 @xmath111 10@xmath112 m and has a temperature of 8000 k. fig .",

    "we found that the h@xmath0 emission originated from a region interior to the photosphere ( see sect .",
    "2.1 for definition of photosphere ) at all times in the evolution of the spectrum .",
    "this is to be expected as the photosphere defines the location of continuum emission while h@xmath0 emission occurs at a chromospheric region which is dependent on the density and temperature of the plasma @xcite . as future work",
    ", improvements must be made to our formalism to include such elements as asymmetries since higher order effects could have an impact on the spectroscopic behaviour of this system .",
    "a more detailed study of the structure of the rsne and the role of the density and temperature profiles on the spectroscopy of the qn will as well be undertaken in future studies .",

    "we predict some @xmath115 elements should appear late in the evolution of the sn 2006gy spectrum evolving in concert with the fe ii and ca ii .",
    "the intensity of the @xmath115 emission lines should be much lower than those from the rsne as    @xmath116    plotted as a solid black line in fig .",
    "[ lcfit ] is the column density of the crsne .",
    "after shock breakout the column density of the neutral crsne rapidly rises to @xmath117 @xmath118 , thus quickly becoming opaque to x - rays .",
    "this naturally explains why _ chandra _ observations show minimal x - ray production from sn 2006gy .",
    "we were able to reproduce the light curve of sn 2006gy using a range of progenitor masses .",
    "the lower mass models required a higher emission coefficient ( @xmath119 value ) and longer time delays to recover the fit .",
    "because @xmath24 does not vary from one fit to another and the continuum levels remain the same ( hence the same fit to the light curve ) , the spectra are unaffected by varying the above parameters .",
    "the range of possible @xmath119 coefficients highlights our ignorance of the emission process and more detailed radiative transfer calculations will be required to narrow down the progenitor mass and the time delay between sn and qn .",
    "regardless , our models do show that given a progenitor mass between @xmath120 and @xmath121 , enough energy is available to explain the amplitude and breadth of the sn 2006gy light curve .",
    "the qn model presented in this proof - of - principle analysis simultaneously provides a very good fit to both the light curve and spectra of sn 2006gy .",
    "the broad , luminous peak of the light curve is described by radiation emitted from the hrsne .",
    "the late stage plateau in the light curve , which is thus far inexplicable in other models , is naturally explained by emission from the slowly coasting hp .",
    "these distinctive features of the qn model also account for the peculiar structure and evolution of the h@xmath0 line",
    ". the persistent broad h@xmath0 component , which is not understood in the context of any other model , is uniquely described by emission from the slowly cooling hp of the qn model .",
    "the blue - side absorption feature observed in the h@xmath0 line is caused by both the crsne and hrsne which attenuate emission from the underlying hp . as the hrsne radiates energy it builds a cold outer layer ( the crsne ) which is opaque to high energy radiation .",
    "this illustrates how an explosion as energetic as sn 2006gy can be surprisingly quiet in x - rays .",
    "the qn is currently being used to model other super - luminous sne .",
    "the findings will be published in an upcoming paper .",
    "this work is intended to demonstrate that a qn explosion of a neutron star only days after the initial sn is able to account for the light curve and spectra of sn 2006gy .",
    "however , the exact emission mechanism of the radiation is not well understood .",
    "the emission coefficient that best reproduces the rise and fall of the light curve resembles bound - free continuum emission ( boosted by a factor of a ) .",
    "the boost may be due to the contribution of some other emission mechanism such as free - free .",
    "future work will concentrate on a more detailed treatment of radiative transfer than possible with the current computer code .",
