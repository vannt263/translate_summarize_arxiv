    "<S> the late growth stages and the post - growth diffusion of crystalline organic thin films have been investigated for 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ptcda ) on ag(111 ) , a model system in organic epitaxy . in situ x - ray measurements at the anti - bragg point during the growth show intensity oscillations followed by a time - independent intensity which is independent of the growth temperature . at @xmath0 350 </S>",
    "<S> k , the intensity increases after growth up to a temperature - dependent saturation value due to a post - growth diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the time - independent intensity and the subsequent intensity recovery have been reproduced by models based on the morphology change as a function of the growth temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology found after the post - growth diffusion processes has been studied by specular rod measurements . </S>"
