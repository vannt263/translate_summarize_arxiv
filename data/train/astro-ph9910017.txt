    "in 1993/1994 we started a long - range photometry program on clusters of galaxies in order to estimate in detail the cluster luminosity function ( lf ) and the morphology of the brightest cluster galaxies .",
    "our aim was to gain more accurate knowledge on this topic both to better understand formation and evolution , and to improve the comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "straightforward scientific drivers are at the basis of this investigation : the luminosity function of cluster galaxies at present time is the result of cluster initial formation and subsequent evolution - taking into account internal phenomena and external interactions .",
    "it is reasonable , and to some extent expected , that at formation the galaxy mass function is a universal constant . in this case , assuming that every evolutionary process keeps a constant m / l ratio , it would be reasonable to expect a universal lf , even if it can not be excluded that evolution and richness might play a role on this stage .",
    "present day observing evidence is , however , that the mass is organised into differently shaped and differently luminous galaxies - the galaxy population depending strongly on the cluster density and morphology",
    ". it would be strange if nature , in the unfolding of this multivariate process , could set to work such a fine - tuning as to maintain the exact proportionality between mass and luminosity , even assuming a universal initial mass function .    the assumption of a universal lf for all the clusters ( colless 1989 and ,",
    "more recently , threntham 1997 , 1998 ) might therefore be too coarse of a tool for characterizing the cluster population .",
    "infall and icm - galaxies interaction might further perturb the shape of the lf during the evolution of the cluster . in this respect it seemed of fundamental importance to evaluate the faint end of the lf .",
    "meanwhile , important work has been published on this topic following the excellent papers on the virgo cluster by binggeli et al .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) approached the study by selecting a catalogue of bright galaxies in the coma cluster . undoubtedly , this direct method is a sound way to proceed , but the construction of a spectrophotometric catalogue of a large number of rich clusters demands an unaffordable amount of time with a 4 meter class telescope .",
    "another very interesting photometric approach is that of bernstein et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , for the same coma cluster , where particular attention has been given to the faint end of lf . in that work , however , the bright part remains ill - defined .",
    "a general consideration of the different studies is the limited application of their results , often making it impossible to compare directly the catalogue and lfs .",
    "this led us to build our consistent photometric catalogues .",
    "in this paper we outline at first the selected sample : other authors might be interested in this bookkeeping ( avoiding or comparing duplications ) and it will help the reader to follow our work to its the completion .",
    "secondly , we detail our observational strategy and methods of data reduction , particularly in those points where they differ from the standard analysis used in the literature .",
    "they will then form a basic reference for other papers in preparation .",
    "the observing strategies are strongly related and tuned to the data analysis methods .",
    "these procedures have first been applied to the cluster abell 496 ( see also molinari et al . 1998 , paper i , for discussion on lf ) , for which we publish here the photometry .",
    "the sample has been selected from the catalogue given in de grandi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) by choosing only clusters at declination @xmath6 , with x - ray fluxes measured in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev energy band larger than @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 , and with extended x - ray emission ( i.e. , sources with probability to be point - like , as computed by de grandi et al .",
    "1997 , smaller than 1% ) .",
    "the resulting sample of 20 clusters is reported in table [ tab : campio ] .",
    "columns list the main x - ray and optical properties for each source as follows : _ column ( 1 ) ",
    "_ cluster name .",
    "_ column ( 2 )  _ x - ray position : j2000.0 right ascension ( hh mm ss.s ) .",
    "_ column ( 3 )  _ x - ray position : j2000.0 declination ( dd mm ss.s ) .",
    "_ column ( 4 )  _ cluster red - shift .",
    "_ column ( 5 )  _ unabsorbed x - ray flux computed in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band in units of @xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 .",
    "_ column ( 6 )  _ bautz - morgan type .",
    "_ column ( 7 )  _ optical richness .",
    "_ column ( 8)  _ status of observations ( obs.= observed )    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      finally , the distribution of the @xmath10 colours of the sequence galaxies is analysed as a function of their projected distance from the centre of the cluster .",
    "we find a significant correlation relative to the population of faint galaxies .",
    "as partly expected , brighter galaxies tend to dominate in the central region of the cluster .",
    "such galaxies ( see also the discussion on the @xmath11 relation ) tend to be somewhat redder .",
    "therefore we expect a mild correlation between the cluster integrated colour - defined as the mean colour derived from the galaxy population located at a given distance from the centre - and the distance from the centre .",
    "the total gradient expected to be @xmath12 in @xmath10 . on the other hand if we limit ourselves to consider only the dwarf galaxies ( bottom of fig.[fig : gradi ] ) , we do not measure any correlation between the mean galaxy magnitude and the distance from the cluster centre . in spite of this lack of correlation",
    "the faint cluster population shows a well - defined colour gradient moving outward from the centre ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gradi ] ) .",
    "this effect is significant at a 4 sigma level and unrelated to the @xmath11 relation . indeed over the small range of magnitude we took into consideration ( @xmath13 ) such an effect",
    "would be at most of about 0.1 mag , while we observe a gradient of about 0.3 magnitudes .",
    "hbt ]    c +   +    a very similar result is found by secker ( 1996 ) in coma cluster ; conversely , hilker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) do not find any correlation between the projected distance from the centre and the colours of dwarf galaxies in the central region of fornax cluster .",
    "we started a project whose main goal is the determination of the cluster luminosity function and its relation to the cluster morphology and population . in this paper",
    "we describe the procedure used for the analysis of the data using a496 as a test case .",
    "the lf of this cluster has been published in molinari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .    in the present study , examination of the space distribution of the blue galaxies reveals a density peak at about a core radius @xmath14 arcsec ( @xmath15 mpc ) from the cluster centre .",
    "this finding should be related to observation of a blueing of the galaxy population , beginning from the cluster centre to its outskirts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gradi ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon , demonstrated to be independent from the cmr relation and luminosity segregation , calls for physical differentiation in the galaxy stellar content .",
    "furthermore , we measure a rather blue cd halo with a remarkable north - south colour asymmetry .",
    "this is different from what has been found , e.g. , by molinari et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who ascribed the very red cd halo was to a m0-like stellar population , implying that any model deserves further consideration ."
