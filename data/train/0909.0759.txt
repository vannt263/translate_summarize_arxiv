    "strongly correlated electronic materials , which include high - temperature superconductors , heavy fermions , and magnetic compounds , are characterized by competing phases and complicated phase diagrams .",
    "these competing phases can lead to quantum criticality when one of the transition temperatures is driven to absolute zero as a function of a non - thermal control parameter such as pressure or doping  @xcite . while the physics of a conventional phase transition is driven by thermal fluctuations , near a quantum critical point ( qcp )",
    ", quantum fluctuations affect the properties of a material up to surprisingly high temperatures @xcite .",
    "in particular , transport measurements of hole - doped cuprates suggest the presence of a qcp  @xcite lying beneath the superconducting ( sc ) dome .",
    "@xcite although it is believed that this qcp dominates the phase diagram , its nature is still unknown@xcite with competing scenarios emphasizing the role of bosonic or fermionic fluctuations.@xcite    in this work , we provide evidence for the nature of the qcp in the hubbard model of the cuprates by a systematic study of its phase diagram .",
    "our results suggest that the qcp is _ not _ due to order in the pseudogap ( pg ) region , but rather is the zero - temperature limit of a line of second - order critical points associated with a first - order phase - separation transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scematic_phase_diagram ] ) .",
    "the control parameter for this transition is the next - near - neighbor hopping parameter , @xmath0 .    although it is possible to have a qcp not associated with any obvious order parameter , as in the case of a localization transition , in most qcps a continuous order parameter vanishes at @xmath3 for a particular value of the controlling energy scale  @xcite .",
    "less common is a qcp associated with a first - order transition , but this is possible when the first - order transition terminates at a second - order critical point which is driven to zero by tuning the relevant parameter .",

    "for @xmath9 the first - order phase - separation transition terminates at a second - order critical point at doping @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the line of second - order critical points @xmath12 , approaches the qcp on the @xmath13 plane .",
    "this is the critical point separating the pseudogap ( pg ) from the fermi - liquid ( fl ) region.,scaledwidth=37.0% ]    the latter case is consistent with the scenario of fig .",
    "[ fig : scematic_phase_diagram ] , where the role of the field angle is played by @xmath0 . for positive @xmath0 and below a certain temperature ,",
    "the system undergoes a first - order phase - separation transition . in this region , two solutions with different densities coexist for a given chemical potential , @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this first - order metal - insulator transition was studied by gull _",
    "_  @xcite and used to map out the phase diagram of this model in the space of interaction strength and @xmath14 . since these two phases have the same symmetry , this transition terminated in a second - order critical point at temperature @xmath11 and critical filling @xmath10 where the charge susceptibility diverges . by increasing @xmath0",
    ", @xmath11 increases and the critical point becomes numerically accessible . for low @xmath0 , it is no longer accessible , but its presence is evidenced by a peak in the charge susceptibility .",
    "our starting point is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the tight - binding dispersion as a function of the hopping @xmath17 between nearest neighbors and @xmath0 between next - nearest neighbors , @xmath18 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons of wave vector @xmath19 and spin @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "we solve the hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite on a @xmath23-site cluster .",
    "the dca is a cluster mean - field theory which maps the original lattice model onto a periodic cluster of size @xmath24 embedded in a self - consistent host .",
    "spatial correlations up to a range @xmath25 are treated explicitly , while those at longer length scales are described at the mean - field level .",
    "however the correlations in time , essential for quantum criticality , are treated explicitly for all cluster sizes . to solve the cluster problem , we use weak - coupling expansion continuous time quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method  @xcite with highly optimized blocked and delayed updates  @xcite , a determinant qmc method which scales linearly in the inverse temperature  @xcite , as well as hirsch - fye qmc  @xcite .",
    "the fast determinant qmc was used to obtain a converged dca solution , hirsch - fye qmc was used to calculate lattice susceptibilities , and continuous time qmc was used as a control for systematic error .",
    "the unit of energy is @xmath17 in the entire paper .    to make contact with previous results , we perform simulations with @xmath26 , but we find that the phase separation becomes more prevalent for @xmath27 for which we present most of our results .",
    "we calculate the filling , @xmath28 , versus @xmath7 and the compressibility , @xmath29 , by taking the numerical derivative .",
    "we also calculate various susceptibilities including the charge @xmath30 , spin and pairing susceptibilities by solving the lattice bethe salpeter equation using the renormalized dca vertices @xcite .",
    "note that as a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , @xmath30 is identical to @xmath29 , but we keep both terms , compressibility and susceptibility , to identify the method by which they are calculated .",

    "the filling increases monotonically with the chemical potential and shows a pronounced flat region , associated with the mott gap , especially for @xmath34 .",
    "the most interesting feature of @xmath35 is an inflection apparent at finite doping , which becomes more pronounced for larger values of @xmath0 .",
    "the inflection in @xmath35 translates into a peak in the compressibility ( shown on the right axis ) .",
    "the peak becomes sharper and moves closer to half filling as @xmath0 increases . for @xmath36 ,",

    "the minus sign problem becomes worse when the cluster size , @xmath22 or @xmath45 increases or the temperature decreases .",
    "however , the cluster size , interaction @xmath22 and @xmath0 affect the phase diagram in different ways .",
    "in previous studies  @xcite , we found that for @xmath46 , clusters with @xmath47 and @xmath48 have roughly the same phase - separation transition temperature when @xmath27 . here , using the same interaction strength , we find that the cluster size effects are stronger for smaller values of @xmath0 . as the cluster size is decreased , the charge susceptibility is somewhat suppressed , and more significantly , the critical doping moves towards half filling .",
    "with increasing @xmath22 in the range from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , the peak in the charge susceptibility moves to lower fillings and higher temperatures .",
    "so , despite the worse minus sign problem associated with larger values of the interaction , the region of divergent charge fluctuations becomes larger and more accessible for @xmath27 .",
    "for this reason , from this point on we will use a smaller cluster with @xmath42 and @xmath27 , in order to access the second order critical points and investigate their relationship to superconductivity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmut](b ) , we plot @xmath28 and @xmath29 versus @xmath7 for several @xmath0 and temperatures .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : nmut](a ) , we see a cusp emerge in the compressibility . as the temperature",
    "is lowered , the peak in the compressibility is enhanced for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "however , for a larger @xmath0 , e.g. , @xmath46 , and for @xmath53 , we find hysteresis between two stable solutions with different values of @xmath28 for the same value of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the presence of hysteresis indicates that the system has undergone a first - order phase - separation transition .",
    "we explore the line of second - order critical points of these first - order transitions as @xmath0 changes using the charge susceptibility as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge ] . here",
    ", the inverse charge susceptibility at @xmath10 is plotted versus temperature for different values of @xmath0 when @xmath27 and @xmath42 .",
    "the critical filling identified in the legend is determined as the filling where the compressibility either diverges , or is peaked at the lowest accessible temperatures .",
    ", @xmath42 for several values of @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the critical filling @xmath10 shown in the legend correspond to the maximum of low temperature compressibility , or the filling where it first diverges.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]    we find that the temperature of the second - order critical point increases with increasing @xmath0 and that it moves towards half filling .",
    "however , unlike the @xmath26 results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmut](a ) , the critical point appears to avoid half filling even for @xmath54 .",
    "the stronger coulomb interaction @xmath27 also strengthens the mott gap for this @xmath0 as can be seen in the persistence of the flat region in @xmath35 near @xmath55 for @xmath54 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : nmut](b ) ] .    the charge fluctuations associated with phase - separation influence the sc phase diagram .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_nc8_u8 ] for @xmath42 , @xmath27 , and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the pseudogap temperature , @xmath59 , obtained as the temperature where the bulk spin susceptibility peaks ( see ref .  ) , is also plotted . for @xmath13 , @xmath59 vanishes at the qcp , which for this smaller cluster has moved to @xmath60 .",
    "note that for @xmath13 , the sc dome is centered on the qcp , suggesting that superconductivity is associated with the quantum fluctuations . for @xmath51 and @xmath46 ,",

    "note that the maximum sc transition temperature increases slightly with increasing @xmath0 which is in agreement with previous results for a four - site cluster , and the same interaction strength  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model with next - near - neighbor hopping has allowed us to identify the nature of the qcp under the sc dome .",
    "we argue that qcp is the terminal point of a line of second - order critical points associated with first - order phase - separation transitions .",
    "the critical temperature is driven to zero as @xmath62 . for positive @xmath14 ,",
    "a mott liquid and a mott gas coexist at fixed @xmath7  @xcite . in real materials",
    "other parameters , such as electron - phonon interaction , inter - site electron - electron interaction or inhomogeneities , might play a role similar to @xmath14 .",
    "generally , it is accepted that the model with @xmath63 describes the electron - doped and that with @xmath64 described the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "we find that the model for @xmath63 does not display quantum criticality , but rather classical criticality .",
    "the qcp is found only for @xmath65 and as is known from other quantum critical systems , it will strongly affect the system for a wide range of parameters and temperatures around this point , including @xmath64 , the model for the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "the relationship of the superconductivity with the qcp at @xmath13 is not yet clear , but the fact that the dome is centered at the qcp suggests that the incipient phase separation creates conditions favorable for superconductivity  @xcite",
    ". the mott liquid phase may provide regions where the spin - mediated pairing interaction is strong and the mott gas may provide regions where there are quasiparticles to pair .",
    "it may also be that the incipient charge fluctuations when combined with the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations enhance the pairing within a narrow region near the qcp  @xcite .",
    "the phase - separated region might also be related to the pervasive inhomogeneities observed in cuprates which led to theoretical scenarios for an inhomogeneity - based pairing mechanism  @xcite or an enhancement of pairing interactions  @xcite . finally , it has been suggested that in the vicinity of the qcp , even a weak retarded attractive interaction may become far more effective at inducing pairing  @xcite .",

    "the filling associated with the second - order critical point is determined from the peak position in the compressibility versus chemical potential .",
    "the peak grows by decreasing the temperature or increasing the cluster size or the interaction strength .",
    "we also show that for @xmath9 and at @xmath68 , the charge susceptibility diverges at a finite temperature which decreases by decreasing @xmath0 . as @xmath44 , @xmath10 moves continuously from values close to half filling to the filling that corresponds to the qcp . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the sc dome is centered at the qcp where the pseudogap temperature , @xmath59 , also vanishes .",
    "this suggests that the incipient phase separation might play a role in the pairing mechanism .",
