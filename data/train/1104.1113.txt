    "in recent years , attention has been given to the study of collective oscilations in alkali metal gases , cooled and confined in magneto - optical traps ( mots ) @xcite .",
    "such a cooperative behavior is driven by light and results from the random scattering between the atoms , being in the root of a long - range interaction potential .",
    "surprisingly , this collective interaction is very similar to that observed in coulomb systems , since it scales as @xmath0 , which allows one to establish analogies between cold atoms and plasmas .",
    "the evidence of such coulomb - like forces due the random scattering of photons was first discovered by walker et al .",
    "@xcite and dalibard @xcite , where the divergence of the effective net force between the atoms was shown to be proportional to the mot density . as a consequence , it is possible to define an equivalent electric charge for the neutral atoms .",
    "the advantage of such a system is that the effective charge depends on the basic parameters of the system , what makes mots good candidates to observe plasma physics phenomena with a tunable  electric  charge .",
    "a strong manifestation of the plasma character of mots was also revealed by the studies of coulomb explosions of the atomic clouds , performed by pruvost et al @xcite .",
    "recently , we have shown theoretically that waves and oscillations of the plasma type can also exist in the neutral gas @xcite and have explored the plasma character of magneto - optical traps to the study of parametric instabilities @xcite .    here",
    "we propose to study the spectrum of density fluctuations in the ultra - cold gas , by using collective laser scattering techniques . in doing this",
    ", we explore even further the analogy between the ultra - cold neutral gas confined in a magneto - optical trap and a plasma , by adapting well known plasma physics theoretical techniques to this new problem .",
    "first , we determine the scattered fields , and the expected average scattered power .",
    "second , we determine the spectrum of density fluctuations , in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "we use here the test particle method , well known in plasma physics @xcite .",
    "finally , we characterize the main properties of the expected scattered signal .",
    "we start by stating the basic equations of our problem .",
    "the propagation of a laser pulse along the ultra - cold gas is governed by the wave equation    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the laser electric field and @xmath3 is the polarization field in the gas , as determined by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the atomic susceptibility tensor .",
    "using fourier transformations of the fields    @xmath6    one obtains    @xmath7    because we can neglect the anisotropies in the majority of the mot , the atomic susceptibility tensor @xmath8 can be safely replaced by the spectral susceptibility function @xmath9 which , for the two - level atom , is given by    @xmath10    here , @xmath11 is the number of atoms per unit volume , @xmath12 is the single atom susceptibility , @xmath13 is the radiation frequency detuning with respect to the atomic transition frequency @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the corresponding line width and @xmath16 represents the rabi frequency .",
    "the local density can fluctuate in time , at frequencies much lower than those of the radiation field frequency @xmath17 , thus leading to the replacement of @xmath11 by @xmath18 in the above expression .",
    "the total radiation field @xmath2 will be determined by the sum of two parts , the incident laser field @xmath19 , and the scattered field @xmath20 . for a real incident laser field",
    ", we can use    @xmath21    where the wave - vector @xmath22 follows the dispersion relation    @xmath23 \\ ; , \\quad \\chi ( \\omega_0 ) = n_0 \\chi_a ( \\omega_0 ) , \\label{eq:2.4b}\\ ] ]    with @xmath24 being the atomic mean density .",
    "such an approximation is valid for mots with a moderate number of atoms ( typically , @xmath25 . ) on the other hand , the scattered field can be generically written as    @xmath26    and the field components can be determined by solving the corresponding wave equation , which can be written as    @xmath27    where    @xmath28    and @xmath29 is the frequency of density fluctuation . in its turn , the scattered wave number @xmath30 will be determined by the same dispersion relation as in eq .",

    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.6 ] ) can therefore be written as    @xmath34    where we have used the unit polarization vectors for the incident and the scattered fields , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the integration in volume leads to the appearance of a delta function @xmath37 , and subsequent integration over @xmath38 finally leads to    @xmath39    where the amplitude of the scattered field is determined by    @xmath40    with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the relative scattered intensity along the direction of @xmath30 is therefore determined by the dynamical structure factor    @xmath43    this quantity can easily be related with the density correlation function , by noting that    @xmath44    performing an average in both space and time , the latter equation reads    @xmath45    equation ( [ eq:2.10 ] ) establishes the relation between the scattered signal and the fluctuations inside the cloud , which contain the basic features of the laser cooled gas .",
    "we should therefore proceed by understanding how to compute such fluctuations by taking into account the microscopic distribution of the atomic states .",
    "in the quasi - classical approximation , a trapped alkali gas in a mot can be described by a kinetic equation of the form @xcite    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the atomic distribution function . here",
    "the collective force @xmath48 can be determined by the poisson equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the atomic effective charge @xcite    @xmath51    here , @xmath52 is the total intensity resulting from the six cooling laser beams , @xmath53 is the saturation intensity of the atom , @xmath54 is the speed of light , @xmath55 represents the optical cross section for absorbing photons of the laser beams and @xmath56 is the optical cross section for absorbing photons that are reradiated from the atoms in the trap . @xcite .",
    "our procedure will consist in the test particle method @xcite , by considering a single atom inside the trap moving with speed @xmath57 as the perturbation source .",
    "the presence of such a test particle will lead to a fluctuation in the gas distribution function @xmath58 , as determined by the linearized kinetic equation    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the unperturbed ( or the equilibrium ) distribution function , and the collective force perturbation @xmath61 induced by the test particle in the medium is determined by    @xmath62 d \\mathbf{v}. \\label{eq:3.4}\\ ] ]    the test particle position is assumed to be given by @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath66 for the perturbed force and distribution , respectively , we can easily obtain    @xmath67    similarly , the fourier transformation of equation ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) leads to @xmath68 replacing this in equation ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) , and noting that the collective force is purely longitudinal , in such a way that @xmath69 , we can write    @xmath70    where we have introduced the dielectric function of the atomic gas    @xmath71    replacing equation ( [ eq:3.8 ] ) in the expression of the perturbed distribution , we then get    @xmath72    after inverse fourier transforming , we can compute the perturbed force due to the test particle    @xmath73}{\\epsilon ( \\mathbf{k } \\cdot \\mathbf{v } ' , \\mathbf{k } ) } \\frac{d \\mathbf{k}}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\label{eq:3.11}\\ ] ]    and the associated perturbation to distribution function    @xmath74}{\\epsilon ( \\mathbf{k } \\cdot \\mathbf{v } ' , \\mathbf{k})}\\frac{\\mathbf{k } \\cdot \\partial w_0 / \\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{k } \\cdot ( \\mathbf{v } ' -   \\mathbf{v } ) } \\frac{d \\mathbf{k}}{(2 \\pi)^3}. \\label{eq:3.11b}\\ ] ]    finally , the density perturbation created at a position @xmath75 and instant @xmath76 by a test particle located at position @xmath77 at @xmath78 moving with velocity @xmath57 , can be now determined by    @xmath79    at this point , it should be notice the power of this method , as all the atoms in the gas can be individually considered as test particles .",
    "this means that the total averaged perturbations can be calculated by integrating the relevant quantities defined above over the equilibrium distribution function @xmath80 .",
    "in particular , the averaged mean force perturbation can be determined by    @xmath81    this quantity is a linear superposition of purely oscillating quantities , and it can easily be found using equation ( [ eq:3.11 ] ) that it is identically zero    @xmath82    while the averaged quadratic mean force @xmath83 , on the other hand , generally is not .",

    "the main difference relies on the fact that we only have one particle species here , which suggests that the system can be regarded as a one - component plasma .",

    "the latter defines the nature of the scattering processes .",
    "moreover , for @xmath119 , the scattering signal results from a coherent process , as the system is essentially composed of interacting particles . in a plasma language",
    ", it means that the debye length @xmath120 is larger or comparable to the perturbation wavelength @xmath121 and therefore the correlations between the atoms play an important role on the scattering signal ( unscreened , correlated atoms ) ; on the contrary , if @xmath122 , the scattering is said to be incoherent and the debye length is assumed to be much smaller than the typical size of the perturbation ( screened , uncorrelated atoms ) . in the figure , we have ploted the normalized structure factor in eq .",

    "the physical reason for such results are related with the interference mechanism during the scattering : the excitation of collective perturbations of the density will result on the constructive interference ( and therefore amplification ) of the scattered signal around the natural frequency characterizing the long - range order of the interaction , i.e. @xmath128 . on the contrary , if uncorrelated , single - atoms fluctuations are excited in the systems , the interference will be destructive and , therefore , no resonance is expected to be observed in the spectrum @xmath129 .",
    "few words are now devoted to discuss the experimental observation of the spectra .",
    "the scattering mechanism presented in this work is similar to rayleigh scattering , with the important difference that long - range order between the atoms is present , which is naturally induced during the laser cooling process .",
    "therefore , this could be experimentally implemented in magneto - optical traps in order to measure the collective excitations of the system , as both coherent and incoherent regimes of scattering are possible , opening the door to a new diagnosis . a simple setup for the present technique would consist of a external probe laser beam with a very small waist ( much smaller than those of the cooling beams ) propagating inside the cloud .",
