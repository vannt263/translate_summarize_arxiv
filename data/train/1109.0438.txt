    "with recent advances in microfluidics  @xcite , renewed interest has emerged in quantifying the effects of surface heterogeneities with different local hydrophobicity ( characterized by a local scalar slip  @xcite ) , on fluid motion . in this situation",
    "it is advantageous to construct the effective slip boundary condition , which is applied at the hypothetical smooth homogeneously slipping surface , and mimics the actual one along the true heterogeneous surface  @xcite .",
    "such an effective condition fully characterizes the flow at the real surface and can be used to solve complex hydrodynamic problems without tedious calculations .",
    "well - known examples of such a heterogeneous system include super - hydrophobic cassie ( sh ) surfaces , where trapped gas is stabilized with a rough wall texture , leading to a number of ` super ' properties , such as extreme non - wettability and low hysteresis  @xcite . for these surfaces",

    "@xmath5 , this means that the flow past such surfaces becomes misaligned with the driving force .",
    "this tensorial slip approach , based on a consideration of a ` macroscale ' fluid motion instead of solving hydrodynamic equations at the scale of the individual pattern , was supported by statistical diffusion arguments  @xcite , and was recently justified for the case of stokes flow over a broad class of periodic surfaces  @xcite .",
    "note that an effective slip in a thick channel situation is a characteristics of a heterogeneous interface solely ( being expressed through its parameters , such as local slip lengths , fractions of phases , and a texture period )  @xcite .",

    "channel with two confining surfaces separated by a distance @xmath9 .",
    "in such a situation a natural definition of the effective slip length could be based on a permeability of a hypothetical uniform channel with the same flow rate .",
    "an effective tensorial slip is then determined by flow at the scale of the channel width , and depends on @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this points to the fact that an effective boundary condition reflects not just parameters of the liquid - solid interface , but also depends on the flow configuration  @xcite .",

    "in particular , it has been shown that optimized sh textures may be successfully used in passive microfluidic mixing  @xcite and for a reduction of a hydrodynamic drag force  @xcite , and that the effective slip formalism represents a useful tool to quantify properties of sh surfaces in thick and thin channels . in many situations",
