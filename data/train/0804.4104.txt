    "hydrodynamic models successfully describe basic features of high energy nuclear collisions at cern sps and especially at bnl rhic ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where the utilization of ideal hydrodynamics was supported by theoretical results : it was advocated @xcite that deconfined matter behaves like a perfect liquid . the hydrodynamic approach to _ _",
    "collisions implies a very hot and dense strongly interacting matter as the initial state .",
    "such a state is assumed to be formed soon after the collision , then expands hydrodynamically until the stage when the picture of the continuous medium is destroyed .",
    "roughly , it happens when the mean free path of particles becomes comparable with the smallest characteristic dimension of the system : its geometrical size or hydrodynamic length .",
    "this approach allows one to account for the complicated evolution of the system at a preconfined stage and in the vicinity of the possible phase transitions by means of a corresponding equation of state ( eos ) . by studying the spectra of different particle species versus the initial conditions and eos",
    ", one could get information on the thermal partonic stage of the  little bang \" and further system evolution , which could be also conclusive in the context of discriminating the possible phase transitions .",
    "the problem is , however , whether the predicted momentum spectra , obtained in hydrodynamic models for given initial conditions and eos , are unambiguous .",
    "these spectra depend not only on the initial conditions but also on the final conditions of hydrodynamic expansion since one can not use hydrodynamic equations for infinitely large times because the resulting very small densities destroy the picture of continuous medium of real particles .",
    "evidently , the simplest receipt of the spectrum calculation is the cooper - frye prescription ( cfp ) @xcite which ignores the post - hydrodynamic ( kinetic ) stage of matter evolution and assumes that perfect fluid hydrodynamics is valid till some 3d hypersurface , e.g. , as was supposed by landau @xcite , till the isotherm @xmath5 , where sudden transition from local thermal equilibrium to free streaming is assumed .",
    "it has been known for a long time that cfp leads to inconsistencies @xcite , if the freeze - out hypersurface contains the non - space - like sectors , and should be modified to exclude formally negative contributions to the particle number at the corresponding momenta .",
    "the simplest prescription is to present the distribution function as a product of a local thermal distribution and the step function like @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a time - like or space - like outward normal to a freeze - out hypersurface @xmath9 .",
    "thereby freeze - out is restricted to those particles for which @xmath10 is positive .",
    "this receipt was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe particle emission from enclosed freeze - out hypersurface with non - space - like sectors and it was found that a satisfactory description of central _ _ au__+_au _ collisions at rhic was reached for a physically reasonable set of parameters .",
    "the main features of the experimental data were reproduced : in particular , the obtained ratio of the outward to sideward interferometry radii is less than unity and decreases with increasing transverse momenta of pion pairs .",
    "thereby , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite clearly indicate that early particle emission off the surface of the hydrodynamically expanding fireball could be essential for proper description of matter evolution in _ _ a__+_a _ collisions .    however , sharp freeze - out at some 3d hypersurfaces is a rather rough approximation of the spectrum formation , because the particle emission process of fireballs created in high energy heavy ion collisions is gradual in time .",
    "results of many studies based on cascade models contradict the idea of sudden freeze - out and demonstrate that in fact particles are emitted from the 4d volume during the whole period of the system evolution , and deviations from local equilibrium conditioned by continuous emission should take place ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , freeze - out hypersurfaces typically contain non - space - like parts that lead to a problem with energy - momentum conservation law in realistic dynamical models @xcite .",
    "this concerns also hybrid models @xcite where the transport model matches hydrodynamics on such a kind of isothermal hypersurface of hadronization @xcite .",
    "an attempt to introduce 4d continuous emission in hydrodynamic framework has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite within a simple ideal hydrodynamics , and also supported by numerical transport codes calculations , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . it was found in these papers that the transport freeze - out process is similar to evaporation : high-@xmath2 particles freeze out early from the surface , while low-@xmath2 ones decouple later from the system s center .",
    "the idea of continuous decoupling was further developed based on boltzmann equations in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in particular , an approximate method that accounts for the back reaction of the emission on the fluid dynamics was proposed .",
    "it is worth noting that the back reaction is not reduced just to an energy - momentum recoiling of emitted particles on the expanding thermal medium , but also leads to a rearrangement of the medium , producing a deviation of its state from the local equilibrium , accompanied by changing of the local temperature , densities and collective velocity field .",
    "this complex effect is mainly a consequence of the impossibility to split the evolution of the single finite system of hadrons into the two components : expansion of the interacting locally equilibrated medium and free streaming of emitted particles , which the system consists of .",
    "such a splitting , accounting only for the momentum - energy conservation law , contradicts the underlying dynamical equations such as a boltzmann one @xcite . in view of this , the ideas proposed and results obtained in the quasiclassical approach should be a clue for a quantum treatment of the problem which recently begins to to be developed @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the estimates of the influence of the quantum effects , such as the distortion of the wave function , on the spectra and bose - einstein correlations testify to be relatively small corrections to the quasiclassical approximation @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we develop the formalism of the hydro - kinetic approach and propose approximations for practical calculations .",
    "the problem of self - consistency of the method accounting simultaneously for both the particle emission and fluid ( in general , viscous ) dynamics is studied in detail .",
    "special attention is also paid to the discussion of the applicability conditions of the cooper - frye prescription for sharp freeze - out .",
    "second , we develop a simple hydro - kinetic model of hadronic emission that describes the evolution and emission of particles from a hydrodynamically expanding system undergoing a phase transition .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider here one type of escaping particle ( pions ) only and do not take into account in numerical calculations the back reaction of the emission on fluid dynamics .",
    "we study within such an approach what type of initial conditions , equation of state , etc .",
    ", are preferred in view of current analysis of heavy ion collisions at rhic energies .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the hadronic momentum spectra in _ _ a__+_a _ collisions based on the escape function of particles which are gradually liberated from hydrodynamically expanding systems .",
    "the escape function , introduced in @xcite , is calculated within the boltzmann equations in a specific approximation based on a hydrodynamic approach .",
    "it was shown that such a picture corresponds to a relativistic kinetic equation with the relaxation time approximation for the collision term , where the relaxation time tends to infinity , @xmath11 , when @xmath12 , indicating a transition to the free streaming regime .",
    "for one component system the equation has the form : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the phase - space distribution function , @xmath15 is the local equilibrium distribution with local velocities , temperatures , and chemical potentials that should be found from eq .",
    "( [ boltz-1 ] ) and the initial @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the relaxation time ( inverse rate of collisions in gases ) , @xmath18 here @xmath19 is related to the local fluid rest frame ( local rest frame of the energy flow ) where the collective four - velocity is @xmath20 .",
    "the relaxation time depends on the cross section and is a functional of @xmath15 .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , such kinds of equations at @xmath21 ( inverse of expansion rate ) describe in the first approximation the viscosity effects in gases with a coefficient of shear viscosity @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the method explained below catches in the first approximation also the viscosity effects in an expanding hadronic gas , characterized by fields of temperatures @xmath23 and particle densities @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath35 these conservation laws lead to rather complicated equations for hydrodynamic variables .",
    "it is worth noting that for an expanding system the relaxation time @xmath36 increases with time and , therefore , the deviations from local equilibrium increase too , thereby preventing a use of the widely applied approximate methods based on the expansion of the distribution function in the vicinity of the local equilibrium .    then to solve the kinetic equation ( [ boltz-1 ] ) ,",
    "in accordance with the conservation laws ( [ cons-1 ] ) and ( [ cons-2 ] ) , we need an approximate method that could be applied even for strong deviations from local equilibrium .",

    "our aim here is to study the influence of different types of initial conditions and equations of state on hadronic emission processes .",

    "for realistic cross sections , the standard cfp , related to the fixed isotherm , underestimates the effective temperature of the observed spectra since , during an ideal hydrodynamic expansion , the effective temperature of hadronic transverse spectra is typically decreasing , but particles with relatively high momenta can escape from the system at an early hot stage .",

    "we studied the effects of inclusion of such flow in the initial conditions for hydro - kinetic model calculations and found that a moderate initial flow developed at the very early prethermal stage of the evolution of finite partonic systems into vacuum @xcite results in a noticeable decrease of the system lifetime .",
