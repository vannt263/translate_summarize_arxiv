    "starting from early observations of lerche , lst and schellekens  @xcite , it has become clear over the years that string theory does provide us not only with one consistent low energy effective theory , but with a multitude of solutions . this phenomenon has been given the name `` the landscape ''  @xcite ( for a recent essay on the subject see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it was known from the very first approaches to compactification of string theory to four dimensions that there exist many families of solutions due to the so - called moduli .",
    "these scalar fields parametrise the geometric properties of possible compactification manifolds and their values are generically not fixed .",
    "it was believed for a long time that some stabilisation mechanism for these moduli would finally lead to only one consistent solution . even though it is way too early to completely abandon this idea ,",
    "recent developments suggest that even after moduli stabilisation there exists a very large number of consistent vacuum solutions . especially the studies of compactifications with fluxes ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) clarified the situation .",
    "the effective potential induced by these background fluxes , together with non - perturbative effects , allow to fix the values of some or even all of the moduli at a supersymmetric minimum .",
    "what is surprising is the number of possible minima , which has been estimated  @xcite to be of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "so it seems very likely that there exists a very large number of stable vacua in string theory that give rise to low energy theories which meet all our criteria on physical observables .    after the initial work of douglas  @xcite , who pointed out that facing these huge numbers the search for _ the _ vacuum is no longer feasible , recent research has started to focus on the statistical distributions of string vacua .",
    "this approach relies on the conjecture that , given such a huge number of possible vacua , our world can be realized in many different ways and only a statistical analysis might be possible .",
    "treating physical theories on a statistical basis is a provocative statement and it has given rise to a sometimes very emotional debate .",
    "basic criticism is expressed in  @xcite , where the authors emphasise the point that , as long as we do not have a non - perturbative description of string theory , such reasoning seems to be premature .",
    "moreover such an approach immediately rises philosophical questions .",
    "how can we talk seriously about the idea to abandon unambiguous predictions of reality and replace it with statistical reasoning ?",
    "one is reminded to similar questions concerning quantum mechanics , but there is a major difference to this problem . in the case of quantum mechanics",
    "there is a clean definition of observer and measurement .",
    "most importantly , measurements can be repeated and therefore we can make sense out of a statistical statement . in the case of our universe",
    "we have just one measurement and there is no hope to repeat the experiment .",
    "at the moment there are two roads visible that might lead to a solution of these problems .",
    "one of them is based on anthropic arguments  @xcite , which have already been used outside string theory to explain the observed value of the cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "combined with the landscape picture this gives rise to the idea of a multiverse , where all possible solutions for a string vacuum are actually realised  @xcite ( for a recent essay on the cosmological constant problem and the string landscape see also  @xcite ) .",
    "anthropic reasoning is not very satisfactory , especially within the framework of a theory that is believed to be unique .",
    "another possible way to deal with the landscape might therefore be the assignment of an entropy to the different vacuum solutions and their interpretation in terms of a hartle - hawking wave function  @xcite .",
    "a principle of extremisation of the entropy could then be used to determine the correct vacuum .",
    "we do not dwell into philosophical aspects of the landscape problem in this work , but rather take a very pragmatic point of view , following feynman s `` shut up and calculate '' attitude . in this endeavour",
    "a lot of work has been done to analyse the properties and define a suitable statistical measure in the closed string sector of the theory  @xcite . in this work we are focusing on the statistics of the open string sector  @xcite .",
    "we are not trying to take the most general point of view and analyse a generic statistical distribution , but focus instead on a very specific class of models . in this small region of the landscape",
    "we are going to compute almost all possible solutions and give an estimate for those solutions we were not able to take into account .",
    "there are several interesting questions one can ask , given a large set of possible models .",
    "one of them concerns the frequency distribution of properties , like the total rank of the gauge group or the occurrence of certain gauge factors .",
    "another question concerns the correlation of observables in these models .",
    "this question is particularly interesting , since a non - trivial correlation of properties could lead to the exclusion of certain regions of the landscape or give hints where to look for realistic models .",
    "it should be stressed that in our analysis of realistic four - dimensional compactifications we are not dealing with an abstract statistical measure , but with explicit constructions .",
    "this paper is based on the first part of the author s phd thesis  @xcite and is structured as follows . in section  [ ch_landscape ]",
    "we prepare the stage , introducing the special class of type  ii orientifold models that are our objects of interest .",
    "moreover we explain the two methods we use to analyse these models . on the one hand , the saddle point approximation and on the other hand a brute force computer algorithm for explicit calculations . concerning this algorithm , we comment on its computational complexity , which touches a more general issue about computations in the landscape . in the last section",
    "we discuss another fundamental problem of the statistical analysis , namely the finiteness of vacua .",
    "an analytic proof of finiteness seems to be out of reach , but we give several numerical arguments that support the conjecture that the total number of solutions is indeed finite .",
    "in section  [ ch_stat ] we apply the described methods to type  ii orientifold models .",
    "we begin with general questions about the frequency distributions of properties of the gauge sector in compactifications to six and four dimensions .",
    "after that we select several subsets of models for a more detailed analysis .",
    "we choose those subsets that could provide us with a phenomenologically interesting low energy gauge group .",
    "this includes first of all the standard model , but in addition constructions of pati - salam , @xmath2 and flipped @xmath2 models . in the case of standard model - like constructions",
    "we investigate the relations and frequency distributions of the gauge coupling constants and compare the results with a recent analysis of gepner models  @xcite . in the last part of this section",
    "the question of correlations of gauge sector observables is explored .",
    "finally we sum up our results and give an outlook to further directions of research in section  [ ch_conclusions ] . in appendix  [ app_models ]",
    "we summarise some useful formulae for the different orientifold models .",
    "appendix  [ app_pa ] contains details about the implementation of the computer algorithm , used to construct the models that have been analysed .",
    "as explained in the introduction , our program to classify a subset of the landscape of string vacua is performed on a very specific set of models . in this section ,",
    "we want to set the stage for the analysis , explain the construction and the constraints on possible solutions .",
    "moreover , we have to develop the necessary tools of analysis .    in the first part of this section we give a general introduction to the orientifolds we are planning to analyse .",
    "we focus on the consistency conditions that have to be met by any stable solution .",
    "in particular these are the tadpole conditions for the r - r fields , the supersymmetry conditions on the three - cycles wrapped by d - branes and orientifold planes and restrictions coming from the requirement of anomaly cancellation .",
    "in the second part we develop the tools for a statistical analysis and test them on a very simple compactification to eight dimensions .",
    "there are two methods that we use for six- and four - dimensional models in the next section , namely an approximative method and a direct , brute force analysis .",
    "the first method relies on the saddle point approximation , which we explain in detail and compare it with known results from number theory . for the second method",
    "we describe an algorithm that can be used for a large scale search performed on several computer clusters . to estimate the amount of time needed to generate a suitable amount of solutions , we analyse the computational complexity of this algorithm .    in the last part of this section we investigate the problem of finiteness of the number of solutions , an issue that is important to judge the validity of the statistical statements .",
    "let us give a brief introduction to the orientifold models we use in the following to do a statistical analysis .",
    "we will not try to give a complete introduction to the subject , for readers with interest in more background material , we refer to the available textbooks  @xcite and reviews  @xcite for a general introduction and the recent review  @xcite for an account of orientifold models and their phenomenological aspects .    our analysis is based on the study of supersymmetric toroidal type  ii orientifold models with intersecting d - branes  @xcite .",
    "these models are , of course , far from being the most general compactifications , but they have the great advantage of being very well understood . in particular , the basic constraints for model building , namely the tadpole cancellation conditions , the supersymmetry and k - theory constraints , are well known .",
    "it is therefore possible to classify almost all possible solutions for these constructions .",
    "the orientifold models we consider can be described in type  iib string theory using space - filling d9-branes with background gauge fields on their worldvolume .",
    "an equivalent description can be given in the t - dual type  iia picture , where the d9-branes are replaced by d6-branes , which intersect at non - trivial angles .",
    "this point of view is geometrically appealing and goes under the name of intersecting d6-branes .",
    "we use this description in the following .",
    "the orientifold projection is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 defines the world - sheet parity transformation and @xmath5 is an isometric anti - holomorphic involution , which we choose to be simply complex conjugation in local coordinates : @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the left - moving space - time fermion number .",
    "this projection introduces topological defects in the geometry , the so - called orientifold o6-planes . these are non - dynamical objects , localised at the fixed point locus of @xmath5 , which carry tension and charge under the r - r seven - form , opposite to those of the d6-branes .    both , the o6-planes and d6-branes wrap three - cycles @xmath8 in the internal calabi - yau manifold @xmath9 , which , in order to preserve half of the supersymmetry , have to be special lagrangian . since the charge of the orientifolds is fixed and we are dealing with a compact manifold , the induced r - r and ns - ns tadpoles have to be cancelled by a choice of d6-branes .",
    "these two conditions , preserving supersymmetry and cancelling the tadpoles , are the basic model building constraints we have to take into account .",
    "the homology group @xmath10 of three - cycles in the compact manifold @xmath9 splits under the action of @xmath11 into an even and an odd part , such that the only non - vanishing intersections are between odd and even cycles .",
    "we can therefore choose a symplectic basis @xmath12 and expand @xmath13 and @xmath14 as _ a = _ i=1^b_3/2(x_a^i_i+y_a^i_i ) , _a = _ i=1^b_3/2(x_a^i_i - y_a^i_i ) , and @xmath15 as _ o6 = _ i=1^b_3/2l^i_i , where @xmath16 is the third betti - number of @xmath9 , counting the number of three - cycles .",
    "chiral matter arises at the intersection of branes wrapping different three - cycles .",
    "generically we get bifundamental representations @xmath17 and @xmath18 of @xmath19 for two stacks with @xmath20 and @xmath21 branes .",
    "the former arise at the intersection of brane @xmath22 and brane @xmath23 , the latter at the intersection of brane @xmath22 and the orientifold image of brane @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig_isbranes ] .",
    "in addition we get matter transforming in symmetric or antisymmetric representations of the gauge group for each individual stack .",
    "the multiplicities of these representations are given by the intersection numbers of the three - cycles , i_ab : = _",
    "a_b = _ i=1^b_3/2(x_a^iy_b^i - x_b^iy_a^i ) .",
    "the possible representations are summarized in table [ tab_reps ] , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of @xmath27 .",
    ".multiplicities of the chiral spectrum .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have reviewed the results on the statistics of the gauge sector of a specific class of orientifold models .",
    "we have presented two different methods to derive these results .",
    "the saddle point approximation  @xcite , working well in the eight- and six - dimensional case , is not powerful enough to deal with four - dimensional compactifications , forcing us to perform a more direct computer aided analysis  @xcite .",
    "using this approach , we discussed various aspects of frequency distributions in the gauge sector . after exploring the most general case , we focused on models containing phenomenologically interesting gauge groups . in the particular case of a standard model gauge group  @xcite , an estimate of the number of three generation models in this setup",
    "was given , using the fact that the basic properties of such a model are sufficiently uncorrelated .",
    "for this class of models we also analysed the values of the gauge couplings at the string scale . in the case of models containing a pati - salam or @xmath2 gauge group  @xcite , it was shown that the frequency distributions of gauge factors do not change , indicating that the specific choice of a visible sector does not alter the statistics .    concerning the universality of these results ,",
    "it should be stressed that it is very likely that some of them depend strongly on the specific geometry that has been chosen .",
    "the comparison of some of our results with a study of gepner models  @xcite confirms this conjecture , showing that only those results show similarities , which are fairly independent of the geometry .",
    "especially the amount of three generation standard models might be very different if one chooses other orbifold groups .",
    "to illuminate this point , a study of models on @xmath28 is currently under way  @xcite .",
    "it would be of course very desirable to do similar studies in other corners of the landscape , in order to see whether the distribution of models resembling our four dimensional world is uniform or rather sharply peaked at special points in moduli space .",
    "interesting directions of future studies would be on the one hand to include fluxes in our discussion , which probably give rise to a much larger set of models .",
    "on the other hand one could try to obtain frequency distributions of other important aspects of the ( supersymmetric ) standard model , such as yukawa couplings or soft supersymmetry breaking terms . including these in our discussion",
    "will certainly reduce the number of acceptable models and might also give additional hints which parts of the landscape are worth to be investigated in greater detail .",
    "in this appendix we summarise the concrete examples of orientifold models that are used in this paper .",
    "we fix the notation and translate the conditions explained in general in section  [ ls_orientifolds ] into variables that suit the specific cases and simplify the computations .      for compactification on @xmath30 ,",
    "a special lagrangian submanifold is specified by two wrapping numbers @xmath31 around the fundamental one - cycles . in this case",
    "these numbers are precisely identical to the numbers @xmath32 used in section  [ ls_orientifolds ] .    the tadpole cancellation condition ( [ eq_tad ] ) reads _ a n_a x_a = l , where the physical value is @xmath33 .",
    "the first supersymmetry condition of  ( [ eq_susy ] ) reads just y_a=0 , and is independent of the complex structure @xmath34 on the rectangular torus .",
    "this implies that all supersymmetric branes must lie along the x - axis , i.e. on top of the orientifold plane .",
    "the second supersymmetry condition in  ( [ eq_susy ] ) becomes x_a > 0 . from these conditions",
    "we can immediately deduce that if one does not allow for multiple wrapping , as it is usually done in this framework , there would only exist one supersymmetric brane , namely the one with @xmath35 .      in this case a class of special lagrangian branes is given by so - called factorisable branes , which can be defined by two pairs of wrapping numbers @xmath37 on two @xmath30s .",
    "the wrapping numbers @xmath38 with @xmath39 for the @xmath40 invariant two - dimensional cycles are then given by x^1=n_1 n_2 , x^2=m_1 m_2 , y^1=n_1 m_2 , y^2=m_1 n_2 . to simplify matters we sometimes use a vector notation @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "note that these branes do not wrap the most general homological class , for the 2-cycle wrapping numbers satisfy the relation x^1",
    "x^2 = y^1 y^2 . however , for a more general class we do not know how the special lagrangians look like . via brane recombination it is known that there exist flat directions in the d - brane moduli space , corresponding to branes wrapping non - flat special lagrangians . avoiding these complications",
    ", we use the well understood branes introduced above only .",
    "the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions read _ a n_a x^1_a = l^1 , _ a n_a x^2_a = -l^2 , with the physical values @xmath43 . in order to put these equations on the same footing",
    ", we change the sign of @xmath44 to get _ a n_a x^1_a = l^1 , _ a n_a x^2_a = l^2 .",
    "note that in contrast to models discussed for example in  @xcite , we are only considering bulk branes without any twisted sector contribution for simplicity .",
    "defining the two form @xmath45 , the supersymmetry conditions become u_1 y^1 + u_2 y^2 = 0 , x^1 + u_1 u_2 x^2 > 0 .",
    "the intersection number between two bulk branes has an extra factor of two i_ab=-2 ( x^1_ax^2_b+x^a_2x^1_b + y^1_ay^2_b+y^2_ay^1_b ) .",
    "in the case of @xmath30 it made no sense to restrict the analysis of supersymmetric branes to those which are not multiply wrapped around the torus , because there would have been just one possible construction . in the case of @xmath46",
    "the situation is different and we would like to derive the constraints on the wrapping numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for the original wrapping numbers @xmath49 the constraint to forbid multiple wrapping is @xmath50 . without losing information",
    "we can multiply these two to get ( n_1,m_1)(n_2,m_2)=1 . using the definitions ( [ eq_t4_xydef ] ) of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can rewrite this as ( x^1,y^2)(x^2,y^2)=y_2 , which is invariant under an exchange of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .      in the case of compactifications on this six - dimensional orientifold , which has been studied by many authors ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    "the situation is very similar to the four - dimensional case above .",
    "we can describe factorisable branes by their wrapping numbers @xmath37 along the basic one - cycles @xmath54 of the three two - tori @xmath55 . to preserve the symmetry generated by the orientifold projection @xmath11 , only two different shapes of tori are possible , which can be parametrised by @xmath56 and transform as | : \\",

    "furthermore we introduce a rescaling factor c:=(_i=1 ^ 3(1-b_i))^-1 to get integer - valued coefficients .",
    "these are explicitly given by ( @xmath59 cyclic ) x^0=cn_1n_2n_3 , & & x^i =- cn_i_j_k , + y^0=c_1_2_3 , & & y^i =- c_in_jn_k .",
