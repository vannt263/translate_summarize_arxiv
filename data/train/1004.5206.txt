    "due to the analogies between the nuclear forces and the van - der - waals interaction , the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) foresees the possible occurrence of phase transitions from the liquid to the vapour phases @xcite .",
    "already in the 80 s , these phenomena were linked to the experimentally observed multifragmentation mechanism , i.e.  the sudden break up of an excited nuclear system into many pieces @xcite . however , in the search for signatures of a phase transition , one has to consider that nuclei are finite systems .",
    "new features may appear in addition to standard thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , the nuclear phase diagram is explored with the help of nuclear reactions , where out - of - equilibrium effects may also be present .",
    "these considerations have lead , from one side , to significant developments of the thermodynamics of finite systems and to new definitions of the phase transition , following the concepts of statistical physics @xcite . on the other hand , many efforts have been devoted to the study of the reaction dynamics and to the characterization of the fragmentation mechanism , also in connection with the possible appearance of the signals expected for a phase transition at thermodynamical equilibrium @xcite .    it is generally believed that , in a heavy ion collision at fermi energies , due to the initial compression and/or thermal excitation , the composite nuclear system may expand and reach density and temperature values inside the co - existence region of the nuclear matter phase diagram @xcite . in violent collisions multifragment configurations are characterized by a large degree of chaoticity and a huge amount of the available phase space is populated .",
    "finally several features observed in the exit channel can be related to the thermodynamical ( equilibrium ) properties of phase transitions in finite systems , independently of the specific mechanism that has driven the whole process @xcite .",
    "however , there remain some aspects that reflect the nature of the reaction dynamics and of the fragmentation path , mostly related to out - of - equilibrium effects .",
    "indeed the interplay between the compression - expansion dynamics and the onset ( and nature ) of clusterization affects significantly the fragment kinematical properties and the appearance of collective flow effects .",
    "a thorough study of this dynamics also allows one to access information on the nuclear matter compressibility .",
    "moreover , the specific features of the fragmenting source , such as its mass , charge and excitation energy , are also strongly depending on the pre - equilibrium dynamics and on the time instant where clusterization sets in .",
    "hence , a quantitative understanding of multifragmentation data requires a careful investigation of the whole dynamical path . due to the complexity of the nuclear many - body problem ,",
    "two main lines of approximations have been followed so far .",
    "on one side , the class of molecular dynamics ( md ) approaches employ , to represent a many - body state , a product of single - particle states , with or without antisymmetrization , where only the mean positions and momenta are time dependent @xcite . in almost all these approaches ,",
    "the width is fixed and is the same for all wave packets .",
    "the use of localized wave packets induces many - body correlations ( analogous to those in classical dynamics ) in the particle propagation in the nuclear field , as well as in hard two body scattering , that is treated stochastically . on the other side , mean - field approaches ( and stochastic extensions )",
    "follow the time evolution of the one - body distribution function ( the semi - classical analog of the wigner transform of the one - body density matrix ) , according to approximate equations where higher order correlations are neglected ( mean - field approximation ) , apart from the correlations introduced by the residual two - body collisions . in the stochastic extension of the model , a fluctuation source term",
    "is added to the average collision integral , to account for the stochastic nature of two - body scattering @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the predictions given by models of the two classes , concerning multifragmentation scenarios at fermi energies ( 30 - 50 mev / nucleon ) , has been recently undertaken @xcite .",
    "the models considered are : the stochastic mean - field ( smf ) model including momentum dependence @xcite and the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) model @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , while in the smf case fragment emission is more likely connected to the spinodal decomposition mechanism , i.e.  to mean - field instabilities , in the amd approach many - body correlations have a stronger impact on the fragmentation dynamics , leading to the earlier development of density and momentum fluctuations .    in the present paper",
    "we will discuss quantitatively the impact of the different approximations employed in the two models on several particle and fragment observables of experimental interest .",
    "this also allows one to establish up to which extent some of the observed features may be considered as more robust or general , i.e.not much depending on the details of the fragmentation path and of the models under consideration . by studying reactions with neutron - rich systems , we also investigate isospin observables , in connection to the density dependence of the symmetry energy and the underlying reaction dynamics .",
    "in both smf and amd approaches , the time evolution of the system is described in terms of the one - body distribution function @xmath0 ( or a slater determinant ) , as ruled by the nuclear mean - field ( plus coulomb interaction for protons ) and the residual interaction , i.e.  hard two - body scattering .",
    "the equation can be represented in the form of so - called boltzmann - langevin equation @xcite @xmath1,f\\ } + i[f ]   + \\delta i[f ] , \\label{bl}\\ ] ] where the coordinates of spin , isospin and phase space are not shown for brevity .",
    "@xmath2 $ ] is the self - consistent one - body hamiltonian , @xmath3 $ ] is the average two - body collision integral , and @xmath4 $ ] stands for the stochastic source term @xcite .",
    "the effect of the stochastic term @xmath4 $ ] is considered for the value of the distribution function @xmath5 in each phase space cell @xmath6 .",
    "for example , one may decompose the phase space into square cells of the volume @xmath7 . in the case of local equilibrium ,",
    "the source term @xmath4 $ ] induces the fluctuation of @xmath5 , the variance of which is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the correlations between different cells are usually assumed to be small , but minimal correlations are introduced for the conservation laws . in the approximate treatment of smf presented in @xcite ,",
    "the fluctuations are projected and implemented only onto the ordinary space , agitating the spatial density profile from time to time during the reaction after the local thermal equilibrium is reached .",
    "it should be noted that the variance @xmath8 with the average value @xmath5 is achieved by choosing @xmath9 and 0 with the probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "namely the fluctuation will choose @xmath11 fully occupied phase - space cells , with @xmath11 being the number of nucleons in the system , while the remaining part of phase space becomes empty .",
    "amd represents this situation by using gaussian wave packets @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "each wave packet has the minimum uncertainty @xmath14 and therefore can be regarded as a phase space cell .",
    "the width parameter @xmath15 defines the shape of the cell in phase space .    in amd , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bl ] ) is usually decomposed in a different way for the convenience in writing a stochastic equation for the wave packet centroids .",
    "the mean field effect is decomposed to the motion of the centroids and the change of the shape of the one - body distributions : @xmath16 .",
    "the first term @xmath17 is calculated by employing the fully antisymmetrized wave function @xcite , while @xmath18 is approximately calculated by using a test particle method @xcite .",
    "the stochastic source term is also separated as @xmath19 .",
    "the part @xmath20 is the stochastic effect included in the stochastic collisions ( @xmath21 ) , that move the centroids of the wave packets by choosing the scattering angle randomly .",
    "when a nucleon collides with another , @xmath22 randomly selects a gaussian wave packet from the single - particle state , that has been changing its shape according to @xmath18 , by splitting it into possibilities of gaussian wave packets ( quantum branching or decoherence ) @xcite .",
    "thus the main difference between the two models lies in the implementation of the stochastic term , i.e. , whether the fluctuation in the momentum space is integrated out ( in smf ) or not ( in amd ) .",
    "moreover , in amd , when a collision happens , two entire nucleons are moved to new wave packets in phase space , while it is not necessarily the case in smf .",
    "therefore the fluctuation is expected to have stronger impact on the collision dynamics in amd than in smf .",
    "the isospin and momentum dependent effective interaction employed in the smf model is derived via an asymmetric extension of the gbd force @xcite , leading to the bgbd potential @xcite . in the amd model",
    ", we employ the gogny interaction which are composed of finite - range two - body terms and a zero - range density - dependent term .",
    "the corresponding nuclear matter eos can be written as @xmath23 where the variable @xmath24 defines the isospin content , being @xmath25 ( @xmath26 = n , p ) the neutron or proton density and @xmath27 the total density .",
    "we use a soft equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter ( compressibility modulus @xmath28 mev for bgbd and @xmath29 mev for the gogny force ) . in fig .",
    "[ eos ] we report the eos , as a function of the density @xmath27 , for symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath30 , at zero temperature .",
    "we can easily adjust the parameters of the interaction in order to change the density dependence of symmetry energy ( @xmath31 ) without changing the eos of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the density behaviour of the symmetry energy , @xmath32 , is shown in fig .",
    "we remind that this quantity gets a kinetic contribution directly from basic pauli correlations and a potential part from the highly controversial isospin dependence of the effective interactions @xcite . for the bgbd force ,",
    "we adopt two different parametrizations of the symmetry energy : `` asy - soft '' , that gives a flat behaviour around normal density , followed by a decreasing trend at large density , and `` asy - stiff '' , where the symmetry energy exhibits an almost linear increase with density @xcite . the gogny ( d1 ) force @xcite has a quite similar @xmath32 to the `` asy - soft '' parametrization of bgbd , while another parametrization @xcite of the gogny force has @xmath32 similar to the `` asy - stiff '' version of bgbd .",
    "hence , in the following we will use the labels `` asy - soft '' and `` asy - stiff '' for the gogny forces as well .",
    "0.5 cm        1.cm    within the considered form of the nuclear interaction , the isovector terms depend explicitely on the nucleon momentum @xmath33 , leading to the splitting of neutron and proton effective masses .",
    "the mean - field potential felt by neutrons and protons in asymmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath34 ) is presented in fig .  3 , as a function of the momentum @xmath35 , for three density values and for the adopted interactions ( asy - soft and asy - stiff ) . as an effect of the momentum dependence , the difference between neutron and proton potentials decreases with @xmath35 , becoming negative at high momenta , especially in the asy - soft case .",
    "this corresponds to the proton effective mass being smaller than the neutron one in neutron - rich matter .",
    "moreover , one can see that the difference between neutron and proton potentials is larger , at low density , in the asy - soft case , corresponding to the larger value of the symmetry energy ( see fig .  [ esy ] ) , while the opposite holds above normal density .",
    "the results of the bgbd and gogny forces look very close to each other below and around the fermi momentum , for both neutrons and protons .",

    "we have confirmed that the degree of stopping reached in the reaction is similar for both calculations @xcite .",

    "one can also identify a `` gas '' phase ( @xmath44 ) , associated with particles that leave rapidly the system ( pre - equilibrium emission ) and/or are evaporated .",

    "@xcite , concerning the trajectory followed by the system in the early stage of the dynamics , until fragmentation is observed .",
    "the reaction path can be characterized with the help of one - body observables , such as the radial density profile and the radial collective momentum .",
    "the radial density at a given distance @xmath54 is obtained by averaging the local density @xmath42 over the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath54 .",
    "the radial collective momentum is the projection of the collective momentum at the position @xmath55 along the radial direction , averaged over the surface of the sphere of radius @xmath54 .",
    "these quantities are further averaged over the ensemble events .    in the smf calculations ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) ) the behaviour of the radial density profile indicates that , after an initial compression ( t = 40 fm / c ) , the system expands and finally it gets rather dilute , due to the occurrence of a monopole expansion , generated by the initial compression .",
    "the matter appears mostly concentrated within a given interval of the radial distance ( see for instance the results at t = 100 fm / c ) , indicating the formation of bubble - like configurations ( see also fig .",
    "[ contour_bgbd ] ) , where fragments will appear , and the central region of the system is rapidly depleted .    in amd calculations ,",
    "the density profile in fig .",
    "5(b ) shows the time evolution of the compression and expansion which is qualitatively similar to the smf case .",
    "however , we notice that amd shows broader average density distribution than smf as the system expands , pointing to a faster expansion in the amd , as indicated qualitatively by fig .",
    "[ contour_bgbd ] .",
    "this is confirmed also by the behavior of the collective momentum .",
    "an shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the smf case , after the development of an almost self - similar radial flow , the collective momentum decreases again at the surface of the system , indicating the occurrence of a counter - streaming flow , from the surface towards the interior , trying to recompact the system @xcite . correspondingly a bump is obtained in the radial density distribution ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) at t = 100 fm / c ) .",
    "on the other hand , the collective momentum at the surface of the expanding system keeps almost unchanged in the amd calculations @xcite .",
    "the absence of deceleration effects may indicate that the system ceases to behave as homogeneous while it expands , corresponding to the situation , of rather low average density , in which fragments have already appeared and are distributed widely in space .",
    "this scenario is supported by the analysis of the density fluctuation variance , that reveals an earlier growth of density fluctuations ( leading to an earlier appearance of clusters ) in the amd case @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as the reason of the faster expansion in amd as observed in fig .",

    "the difference observed in the two models could be connected to the fact that clustering effects and many - body correlations are more efficient in amd , due to the nucleon localization , reducing the amount of mass that goes into free nucleons and very light clusters .",
    "this effect is connected also to the different compression - expansion dynamics in the two models , as discussed in the previous section .",

    "this can be taken as an indication of the fact that pre - equilibrium particles are mostly emitted from regions that are below normal density ( i.e.  after @xmath66 fm / c , during the expansion phase ) , where the symmetry energy is higher in the soft case ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "[ nzgas ] , that shows the time evolution of the @xmath83 ratio of emitted particles with @xmath59 , in both models , for the two iso - eos s and the two reactions considered .",
    "the different calculations present some common features .",
    "in fact , we observe in all cases that the two curves of different asy - eos s cross at times @xmath84 around 70 - 100 fm / c , which is more evident for the neutron - rich system . according to the compression - expansion dynamics followed by the composite nuclear system",
    ", the crossing is connected to the fact that the system gradually evolves from a compact shape ( compression , high density ) where the symmetry energy is larger and the system likes to emit more neutrons in the asy - stiff case , to a dilute configuration ( expansion , low density ) where the symmetry energy is larger in the asy - soft case .    1.0 cm   content of the pre - equilibrium emission , as obtained in the two models ( left and right panels ) , for the @xmath85 and @xmath56 reactions .",

    "full lines : asy - stiff interaction . dashed lines : asy - soft.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ nzgas ] can be connected to the differences observed along the compression - expansion dynamics in the two models .",
    "in fact , as discussed in section iii.a , within the smf trajectory the composite nuclear system may enter lower density regions as a nearly homogeneous source and for a longer time , compared to the path followed in amd .",
    "hence the moderate @xmath83 of the pre - equilibrium emission observed in smf can be explained by the rather small value of the symmetry energy at lower density .",
    "this explanation is also consistent with the more abundant emission obtained in smf calculations , since particles are less bound at low density . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath83 ratio in the amd case is much larger , especially for the neutron - rich @xmath86 reaction . due to the efficient clustering effects in amd , protons are trapped in fragments that appear at early times , optimizing the symmetry energy of the whole system .",
    "the same isospin effects can be also observed by looking at the isotopic content of fragments .",
    "figure [ z_a_liq ] shows the @xmath87 content of the `` liquid '' phase ( associated with the composite nuclear source at early times and with imf s at later times ) , as obtained in the two models and with the two parametrizations of the symmetry energy . as expected already from the results concerning nucleon and light cluster emission ,",
    "the `` liquid '' is more neutron - rich in smf .",
    "one can notice that , for the neutron - poor system in fig .",
    "[ z_a_liq ] , the @xmath87 ratio starts to increase at early times , which is due to the repulsive effect of the coulomb interaction and is related to the observation in fig .",
    "[ nzgas ] that @xmath83 is smaller than the @xmath88 ratio of the total system .",
    "this increasing trend of @xmath87 is more pronounced in the smf model , due to the more abundant emission in this case . for the neutron - rich system ,",
    "the initial increase of @xmath87 is weak and observed only in the smf case .",
    "the @xmath87 ratio turns to decrease approximately when fragments appear and neutrons are emitted , lowering the fragment symmetry energy ( isospin distillation @xcite ) .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in the soft case and happens at earlier times in amd .",
    "moreover , isospin distillation is stronger in the neutron - rich system .    at the end",
    ", one can see from figs .",
    "[ nzgas ] and [ z_a_liq ] that the difference between the predictions of the two models is larger than the difference between the results associated with the two iso - parametrizations .",
    "this observation should be taken as a warning that the symmetry energy can not be extracted from merely the @xmath88 content of the reaction products in a model independent way .",
    "in this paper we have undertaken a quantitative comparison of the features observed in heavy - ion fragmentation reactions at fermi energies , as predicted by two transport models : smf and amd .",
    "as far as observables of experimental interest are concerned , one significant discrepancy between the two models is connected to the amount of pre - equilibrium emission , i.e.  the energetic particles that leave the system at the early stage of the reaction . in amd clustering effects appear to be more relevant , reducing the amount of free nucleons emitted , compared to smf , in favour of a richer production of primary light imf s .",
    "the yield of sizeable primary imf s ( @xmath73 ) is close in the two models .",
    "however in smf fragments with charge around 10 are slightly more abundant , while in amd the tail at larger @xmath74 ( around 20 ) is more pronounced .",
    "the shape of the smf charge distribution is closer to the expectations of spinodal decomposition @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that these differences can be smoothened by secondary decay effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , both models are able to fit ( final ) experimental charge distributions ( of imf s ) reasonably well @xcite . in smf",
    "fragment kinetic energies are smaller , compared to amd , by about 20@xmath89 .",
    "these observations corroborate the scenario of a faster fragmentation process in amd , while in smf the system spends a longer time as a nearly homogeneous source at low density , emitting a larger amount of nucleons prior to fragment formation .",
    "another interesting feature is that the @xmath88 ratio of the pre - equilibrium emission and of primary imf s is different in the two models . for a fixed parametrization of the symmetry potential ,",
    "the isotopic content of the emitted particles is systematically lower in smf , where the emission is more abundant . as a consequence ,",
    "imf s are more neutron - rich in smf than in amd .",
    "the latter observation leads to the conclusion that isotopic properties are largely affected by the reaction dynamics .",
    "this can be expected just from the fact that the symmetry energy is density dependent , so isospin observables should keep the fingerprints of the density regions spanned in the collision .",
    "however , the impact of the reaction path on these observables may be more intricate . from this point of view , isospin properties can be also considered as a good tracer of the reaction mechanism and may contribute to probe the corresponding fragmentation path .",
    "hence , the discrepancy between the two models may be ascribed essentially to the different compression - expansion dynamics and clusterization effects that , as shown by our results , affect isoscalar as well as isovector properties of the reaction products .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous analysis of several experimental observables in nuclear reactions at fermi energies should help to shed light on the underlying fragmentation mechanism and the corresponding role of mean - field and many - body correlations .",
    "in other words , a check of the global reaction dynamics could be a way to test the validity of the approximations employed in the dynamical models devised to deal with the complex many - body problem .",
    "one may look at suitable isoscalar observables such as fragment and particle yields and energy spectra , as well as at the isotopic content of the reaction products . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the sharing between the yields of light imf s and light particles ( @xmath59 ) is rather different in the two models , the latter being more abundant and less neutron - rich in smf . in particular ,",
    "the study of pre - equilibrium emission , which is not influenced by secondary decay effects , could really help to probe the reaction dynamics , since the difference between amd and smf predictions is rather large , see the results of fig.s  6,7,12 . only when the model reliability has been established",
    ", one may undertake a deeper investigation of isospin observables , from which more detailed information on the symmetry energy and its density dependence can be accessed .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig.s  12 - 13 , the differences between predictions corresponding to two commonly employed symmetry energy parametrizations are smaller than the differences associated with the two models considered here .",
    "finally , it would be appealing to extend our comparison of multi - fragmentation reactions to other approaches introduced to follow the many - body dynamics @xcite .",
    "in such a context , new developments of stochastic mean field models , in the direction of introducing fluctuations in full phase space @xcite and enhancing the role of correlations , are also of interest .",
    "we thank m.di toro for useful comments and discussions .",
    "we also would like to acknowlegde the european center for theoretical studies in nuclear physics and related areas ( ect * , trento , italy ) for inspiring discussions during workshops on numerical simulations of heavy ion reactions .",
    "this work is supported by grant - in - aid for scientific research ( kakenhi ) 21540253 from japan society for the promotion of science , and partly by high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) as a supercomputer project .",
