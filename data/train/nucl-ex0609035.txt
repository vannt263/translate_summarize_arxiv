    "electromagnetic probes are of crucial importance in relativistic heavy ion physics .",
    "they are real and virtual direct photons ( where _ direct _ means that they are not produced in the decay of some final state hadron ) , and they are penetrating probes produced in virtually all subprocesses of relativistic heavy ion collisions . equally important , once produced they escape unaltered even from a very dense medium because of their weak coupling ( @xmath0 ) . however , this very same property that makes them excellent `` historians '' of the entire collision makes both precise measurements and drawing of definitive conclusions challenging , since one has to disentangle contributions from different processes often with comparable rates in the same @xmath1 region .",
    "in fact , for the experimenter difficulties start already by finding the _ direct _ photons themselves in the large background of photons from ( final state ) hadron decays like @xmath2 , _ etc._. this can be especially hard in the low @xmath1 region ; at higher @xmath1 it is somewhat easier due to the large suppression of hadrons observed in heavy ion collisions ( sec .",
    "[ sec_pi0 ] ) .",
    "interpretation of the results is challenging because the net signal is a convolution of photon spectra from a large variety of possible physics processes as different as initial hard scattering , a pure pqcd process , jet fragmentation , bremsstrahlung , jet - photon conversion in the medium , and thermal radiation from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) and/or a hot hadron gas .    despite all these difficulties , photon physics made major inroads in the first few years of rhic , both experimentally and theoretically - although not always in the areas originally anticipated .",
    "on one hand nlo pqcd calculations of photoproduction at central rapidities have been confirmed both in p+p and d+au ( sec .",
    "[ sec_ppdau ] ) , and we also have a better understanding of the ratio of photons from initial hard scattering and fragmentation in p+p . on the other hand one of the major pre - rhic expectations was to relatively quickly establish the initial temperature @xmath3 after the collision from thermal radiation ; data currently available ( sec .  [ sec_auau ] ) are well described ( within a factor of 2 ) by various models in which @xmath3 ranges from 300 to 660 mev - but this uncertainty is largely due to the unexpectedly fast thermalization ( sec  [ sec_intconv ] ) . in au+au collisions the non - suppression of photons ( sec .",
    "[ sec_auau ] ) became an independent validation of pqcd and of the concept of @xmath4 scaling when establishing `` jet quenching '' in hadrons ( sec .",
    "[ sec_pi0 ] ) .",
    "also in au+au at medium @xmath1 there are hints of medium - induced photons , possibly jet - photon conversion on thermal quarks ( sec .",
    "[ sec_auau ] ) and in the region where thermal radiation is expected to dominate preliminary results from a new analysis technique ( applied for the first time in a heavy ion experiment ) finds a possible signal ( sec .",
    "[ sec_intconv ] ) .",
    "one way to disentangle contributions from different processes like fragmentation and jet - photon conversion is to study the azimuthal asymmetries of photons as a function of @xmath1 , which also can put constraints of the jet energy loss mechanisms .",
    "the first data on photon asymmetries are not conclusive yet ( sec .",
    "[ sec_photonv2 ] ) but new results with much higher statistics are expected to be published soon . finally , imminent and future upgrades of phenix will enhance the scope of our photon physics even further , among others with a competitive measurement of vector mesons at central rapidities and direct photons in the low-@xmath5 region ( sec .",
    "[ sec_outlook ] ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on real photons and dielectron pairs from internal conversion of photons ( other results with electromagnetic probes are described in  @xcite in these proceedings ) . as for the detector ,",
    "the primary tools to detect photons in phenix are the lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) and the lead - glass ( pbgl ) calorimeters , described in detail in  @xcite ; experimental techniques are briefly described in  @xcite .",
    "note that the two detectors are fundamentally different , as are their associated systematic errors , their data are analyzed separately , therefore , comparing their results is a strong , built - in consistency check in phenix .",
    "electron pairs from virtual photons are identified by the tracking system , the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) and the calorimeters  @xcite .",
    "in central au+au collisions ( @xmath6gev ) for @xmath7 , @xmath8 and direct photons , compared to a glv calculation with @xmath9 gluon density .",
    "the mesons - independent of their mass - are suppressed by a factor of 5 with respect to their yield in p+p scaled with the nuclear thickness @xmath10 , whereas the direct photons are not suppressed .",
    ", width=302 ]    before discussing _ direct _",
    "photons we should review briefly what is known about neutral meson ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) production in different systems colliding at rhic energies . in @xmath11gev",
    "p+p collisions the measured @xmath7 cross section  @xcite is well described by the kkp set of fragmentation functions  @xcite up to @xmath12gev / c ( recent preliminary results from run-5 extend this measurement and confirm the agreement with pqcd up to @xmath13gev / c ) . in order to characterize what is different in heavy ion collisions",
    "we introduce the _ nuclear modification factor _ @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath4 is the nuclear overlap function integrated over the relevant impact parameter range .",
    "the behavior of @xmath14 at high @xmath1 ( in the pqcd regime ) , in specific , its deviation from unity is a very important , albeit somewhat ambigous indicator of the appearence of new , non - perturbative processes in nuclei . in d+au collisions and",
    "at least at central rapidities @xmath14 for @xmath7 is consistent with unity  @xcite .",
    "the situation is dramatically different in au+au collisions  @xcite : @xmath7 production at midrapidity is suppressed by a factor of 5 with respect to @xmath4-scaled pqcd expectations , and as seen of fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_auau200 ] the suppression is constant up to the highest @xmath1 where identified hadrons have been masured so far at rhic .",
    "not only does this `` jet quenching '' constitute one of the earliest and most important discoveries at rhic but it also makes the direct photon measurement somewhat easier at high @xmath1 since the s / b is significantly improved .",
    "furthermore , phenix has also shown that the suppression pattern is the same for @xmath8 mesons  @xcite , the second most important background for direct photons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_auau200 ] ) .",
    "finally , phenix also masured @xmath14 at @xmath16gev in cu+cu collisions , a system much smaller than au+au . when mid - peripheral au+au collisions were compared to central cu+cu collisions ( characterized by the same number of participants @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ by the same overlap volume albeit by very different geometry ) , the suppression pattern was the same . we should point out that this is true for the _ average _ , @xmath18-integrated @xmath14 only like the one shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_auau200 ] .",
    "if one studies @xmath14 as a function of the angle @xmath19 with respect to the event - by - event reaction plane  @xcite a significant angular anisotropy is observed ( and attributed to the difference in average pathlength in the medium for quarks in or out of the reaction plane ) .",
    "so we fully expect that a comparison of the differential @xmath20 in the symmetric central cu+cu and the ( @xmath17-equivalent ) eccentric au+au systems will reveal differences and shed some more light on the nature of jet energy loss .",
    "hadron suppression in au+au and lack thereof in d+au collisions together formed compelling evidence that a very high density matter has been formed at rhic that strongly modifies jets created in the initial hard collisions and that - at least at central rapidities - these modifications are not due to a change of the ( initial ) parton distribution functions in a relativistic nucleus . however , from a purist s point of view neither the hadron suppression nor conclusions drawn from it are on solid footing until the validity of the concept `` scaling p+p cross - sections by @xmath4 '' is proven with a penetrating probe .",
    "this happened by measuring @xmath14 for direct photons as also shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : raa_auau200 ] : at and above @xmath21gev / c the direct photon @xmath14 is consistent with unity .",
    "in p+p collisions to leading order in @xmath22 direct photon production is dominated by gluon compton - scattering ( @xmath23 ) , and since rhic is the world s only polarized p+p collider it is a unique place to study ( polarized ) gluon structure functions .",
    "however , as pointed out in  @xcite photons emitted in parton fragmentation are also an important source of direct photons , particularly at low @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , calculations based upon cteq6 parton distribution functions and the grv fragmentation function set predict that at @xmath16gev and at transverse momenta below 3gev / c more than half of photons will come from fragmentation .",
    "note that this is the very same @xmath1 region where in heavy ion collisions the thermal photon signal from the qgp , even if not dominant , might be sufficiently strong to be visible ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot - phenix - theo ] from  @xcite ) . therefore , measurement and theoretical understanding of photon production in p+p is crucial both in its own right and as a baseline to interpret au+au data .",

    "the data / theory ratios are plotted : for both systems the agreement is quite good , although not as spectacular as for pions in p+p  @xcite .",
    "low multiplicities in p+p collisions allow phenix to tag isolated photons by requiring that the energy deposited in a cone around the photon is small compared to the photon energy itself  @xcite .",
    "those isolated photons come mostly from primordial hard scattering ( as opposed to fragmentation ) .",

[ fig : cdirphoton ] show combined results from the phenix pbsc and pbgl up to 14gev / c ( where the two analyses are completely consistent , see sec .

    "the errors at medium @xmath1 ( 5 - 10gev / c ) are already smaller than in the published run-2 data  @xcite but the trend that almost all points are above @xmath4-scaled pqcd survives - a tantalizing hint of additional photon sources like jet - photon conversion , which can be further explored investigating azimuthal asymmetries in the photon distribution ( sec .",

    "a very promising approach to measure low-@xmath1 direct photons is to utilize low - mass electron pairs from `` internal conversions '' , a technique first applied in heavy - ion collisions recently by phenix  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that any process producing a real photon can also produce a virtual one of very low mass  @xcite , subsequently decaying into an @xmath31 pair .",
    "this direct photon signal competes , of course , with dielectrons from dalitz decays of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , _ etc_. the rate and mass distributions of dielectrons are described both for the low - mass direct photons and the dalitz decays by the kroll - wada formula  @xcite , @xmath32 where the form factor , @xmath33 , is unity for real photons .",
    "note that the phase space for dalitz decays is limited by the mass of the parent meson ( @xmath34 ) , while for direct photons it is not ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "the quality of the data currently available is not sufficient to prove or disprove theoretical predictions  @xcite , not even the sign of the net flow .",
