    "cluster formation plays a fundamental role in understanding the structure and properties of nuclei . in recent years",
    ", tremendous progress has been made in the investigation of cluster structure in light nuclei @xcite , especially due to the model wave function with nonlocalized clustering concept , namely the thsr wave function @xcite . the thsr wave function was first proposed to describe the @xmath5-cluster condensation in gas - like states , including the famous hoyle state ( @xmath3 state ) in @xmath7c @xcite .",
    "then it was successfully applied to various other aggregates of @xmath5-clusters such as @xmath8be , @xmath9o , @xmath10ne @xcite , and also to one - dimensional chain systems @xcite .",
    "it was found that one single thsr wave function is almost 100% equivalent to the rgm / gcm ( resonating group method / generator coordinate method ) wave functions for both gas - like and non - gaslike states .",
    "in the recent studies of inversion - doublet - bands of @xmath10ne @xcite , the nonlocalized character of clustering rooted in the thsr wave function is proved to be a very important property for clustering structure in light nuclei .",
    "therefore it is very necessary to investigate the nonlocalized cluster dynamics in other different nuclear systems .    in recent years",
    ", there are also investigations using the thsr wave function and its intrinsic container structure for nuclei beyond traditional @xmath5 aggregates .",
    "this starts with the calculation of @xmath11c with a neutron probe interacting with the 3@xmath5-condensation @xcite .",
    "also , in this year , the 2@xmath5+@xmath12 system is investigated with hyper - thsr wave function , which shows the essential role of the container picture for the cluster structure in @xmath13be @xcite . in our previous work ,",
    "the thsr wave function is constructed with intrinsic negative parity and applied in the calculation of nucleus @xmath14be with proton number z=4 and neutron number n=5 ( n = z+1 ) @xcite . in this study ,",
