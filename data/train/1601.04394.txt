    "both classical and recurrent novae are triggered by thermonuclear runaways , which last for @xmath4100  s at the surface of white dwarfs .",
    "subsequently , the optical flux increases by 6 or more magnitudes , followed by an eventual decline to quiescence @xcite . at the time of thermonuclear runaways , an emission in the ultraviolet to soft x - ray bands that lasts for only a few hours is predicted and is called `` fireball phase '' @xcite .",
    "the fireball phase is predicted to happen a few days before the beginning of the optical nova phase , although it has not been detected yet from any nova system .",
    "in fact , maxi / gsc did discover an extraordinarily luminous soft x - ray flash ( sxf ) maxi j0158@xmath1744 @xcite .",
    "the maxi j0158@xmath1744 system was considered to be in the fireball phase , although there was no association with a usual classical / recurrent nova .",
    "this sxf is characterized with a soft x - ray spectrum , a short duration ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6  s @xmath7 @xmath8  s ) , a rapid rise ( @xmath9  s ) , and a huge peak luminosity of @xmath10 erg s@xmath11 in the @xmath12 kev band .",
    "although the characteristics of this flash are very different from those of usual novae , the soft x - ray emission was successfully interpreted as the fireball phase of a new kind of novae on a very massive white dwarf @xcite .",
    "indeed , this hypothesis was further supported with a detailed simulation performed by @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray emission during the fireball phase is a photospheric emission , and accordingly , the spectral shape is basically a blackbody .",
    "@xcite also concluded that the small increase in the flux observed in the optical counterpart of maxi j0158@xmath1744 did not originate from a photospheric emission as usual novae , but is due to the emission from the disk around the be companion star , which is a reprocess , originated from the photospheric soft x - ray emission .",
    "now , unlike maxi j0158@xmath1744 , the companion star in the white - dwarf binaries that generate novae is in general not a be star .",
    "then , it is unlikely any detectable increase in the optical flux would occur during sxf of a nova , where the companion star is not a be star .",
    "it has been argued in many theoretical studies that white dwarfs can acquire a mass close to or over the chandrasekhar limit via differential rotation ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) or strong internal magnetic fields ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the theoretical works have not caught up with the observational discovery of the new type of nova from a very massive white dwarf ( maxi j0158@xmath1477 ; @xcite ) . at the same time , we need more observational samples to study and understand the phenomenon and its background science . here",
    "we present the result of the systematic search for nova explosions from very massive white dwarfs .    in this paper , we perform the systematic search for the fireball phase emission in the soft x - ray band for usual classical / recurrent novae , using the association of optically discovered novae as predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we should note that the sxf without optical - nova phase like maxi j0158@xmath1744 are out of our samples and hence would not be detected in this search .",
    "however , intermediate objects that possess both the fireball phase with a sxf emission and a optical nova phase are expected to be found , if such objects are actually present .",
    "maxi ( monitor of all - sky x - ray image ; @xcite ) is an all - sky x - ray monitor , which is operated on the japanese experiment module ( kibo ) on the international space station ( iss ) .",
    "maxi carries gas slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ) , which scans the almost entire sky every @xmath13 minutes through the long and narrow fields of view ( fovs ) of @xmath14 .",
    "the scan duration for a point source is @xmath15  s @xcite .",
    "gsc with its gas proportional counters is sensitive for @xmath16 kev . from the start of the operation on 2009 august 15 up to the present day , gsc has almost continuously monitored the whole sky .",
    "all the data have been stored in japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) and institute of physical and chemical research ( riken ) .",

    "maxi / gsc observed these fields of the sky at the period of the discovery in the optical wavelength .",
    "accordingly , maxi / gsc can search the precursive activity in the x - ray band for these novae .",
    "we started the data analysis from the event data of maxi / gsc stored in every day and every camera in the ` fits ` format .",
    "for every source , we extracted events from a circular sky region centered on the target with a radius of , using ` mxextract ` .",
    "we also calculated the time variation of the effective area in every 1  s for the point source determined by slat - slit collimator of maxi / gsc , using ` mxscancur ` .",
    "we made good time intervals ( gtis ) to include this duration and to remove the duration when the counter was off .",
    "we also removed the scans during which the solar paddle of the iss obscured the fov of the gsc counter .",
    "the selected event data in ` fits ` format were converted to ` root ` format to enhance visualization of the data . for every scan",
    ", we measured the flux of the target in the unit of counts s@xmath11 @xmath17 in the @xmath18 kev band , using the tool named `` psf - fit '' .",

    "the spectrum file and the corresponding response file were made for every scan by using ` xselect ` and ` mxgrmfgen ` , respectively .",

    "when the point - spread functions ( psfs ) of nearby sources interfere these regions , the circular regions centered on these nearby sources are excluded .",
    "if a target source is located in a severely crowded region like the galactic plane , measurement of the flux based on such a simple selection of the regions is inadequate , because the psf of a target overlaps with those of nearby sources and because the area of the background region free from contamination of the nearby sources becomes too small to obtain the adequate statistics .    in this work ,",
    "we developed a tool to measure the fluxes for the point sources by fitting event distribution around a target with a model that incorporates of the psfs of the target and nearby sources . both x - ray and non - x - ray backgrounds",

    "we name this tool the psf - fit .",
    "the following is the detailed description of the psf-fit.we use event distribution in the detector coordinate rather than the sky coordinate , because the shape of a psf is best described in the detector coordinate . in this coordinate , the shape of a psf",
    "is given by a triangular - shaped function in the time ( scan ) direction , whereas that in the anode wire direction is given by a gaussian shape @xcite .",
    "the triangular shape is well calibrated @xcite .",
    "the width of the gaussian shape ( sigma ) depends on counters , the position of the anode direction , and the high voltage ( hv ; 1650v or 1550v ) .",

    "thus , we obtained the well - calibrated psf model .",
    "we modeled the event distribution in the detector coordinate ( @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) of a camera ( @xmath186 ; camera ids ) as follows : @xmath187 where @xmath184 is time ( s ) , @xmath185 is the position of anode , bex ( mm ) , and ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) are the sky coordinates ( right ascension , declination ) of the target and nearby sources .",
    "@xmath190 is a set of sources , including the target and nearby sources ( @xmath191 : source ids ) , and they are different among cameras ( @xmath192 ) , because the fovs and condition of each camera are different . @xmath193 and @xmath194 are the source flux in the unit of counts s@xmath11 @xmath17 and the shape of the psf in the unit of @xmath195 mm@xmath11 .",
    "@xmath196 is the shape of a background rate in the unit of counts s@xmath11 mm@xmath11 , for which we used a constant function in this study .",
    "we select events from a rectangular region in the detector coordinate , where the width of time ( scan ) direction is determined to be three times the width of the base side of the triangular shape .",
    "that of the anode direction is set to be 16 sigma of the gaussian shape . as a result ,",
    "these widths vary in every scan .",
    "we then add a constraint for these widths so that the rectangular region can not exceed a circular sky region with a radius of 8 deg , which is the radius of the event extraction at the beginning of the analysis ( section [ sec : obs ana ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : selevt ] shows an example of the event distribution in the detector coordinate to be used for the psf - fit .",
    "it is for v5586 sgr on a scan at the modified julian day ( mjd ) 55340 with a camera ( i d = 0 ) in the @xmath18 kev band .",
    "we minimize the following cost function , c - stat @xcite , to calculate the fluxes of a target and nearby sources , @xmath197,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 is a set of the operating cameras and @xmath199 is a set of the events detected in a camera ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "@xmath200 is an integration area for a camera ( @xmath192 ) , where the time duration of hv - off and the center of the camera in the anode direction ( @xmath201  mm ) are masked out .",
    "the region of the anode edges ( @xmath202  mm ) is also masked out . to speed up the calculation , we use unbinned likelihood instead of binned likelihood . `",
    "minuit2 ` minimizer is used for minimization of the cost function . to calculate the error ranges ,",
    "we calculate the likelihood interval @xcite , using ` minos ` in ` minuit2 ` .",
    "when a target is located in a crowded region like the galactic plane , there are many various nearby sources ; some sources are always bright enough to be detected by maxi / gsc , while some are usually faint and have a potential to become bright above the threshold of maxi / gsc sensitivity . for almost any region in the sky , maxi / gsc is the only x - ray detector that monitors these sources ; then it is impossible to determine a priori which sources are detectable and which are not .",
    "however , we must select which source is necessary to be included in the model for the psf - fit .",
    "we approach this problem as follows .",
    "we pick up candidates for the nearby sources to be included in the psf - fit from the catalog used in the nova search system @xcite .",
    "the area for picking up these candidates are the rectangular region in the detector coordinate as described above and the outer marginal region with half width of the base side of the triangular shape for the time direction and three sigma of the gaussian shape for the anode direction .",
    "this marginal region for selecting the nearby sources is necessary to account for the contamination of psfs of sources out of the fitting region , within which the events are extracted ( figure [ fig : selevt ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : objs ] demonstrates the positions of the nearby candidate sources listed in the catalog in the example case , as well as the region for the event extraction ( fitting ) and outer marginal regions .",
    "the nearby sources included in the psf - fit ( black labels in figure [ fig : objs ] ) are selected with the measure of the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; @xcite ) from the candidates ( green labels in figure [ fig : objs ] ) as follows .",
    "first , we fit the event distribution with the simplest model that includes only the background , and calculate the bic .",
    "next , we include one nearby source among all the nearby candidate sources into the model function , and fit the events with this model and calculate the bic .",
    "we then identify the best nearby source with the minimum bic as the first selected nearby source .",
    "if this minimum bic is larger than that of the previous bic obtained by the fit that includes only the background , which means that no nearby source is necessary to improve the fit , then the model selection for the nearby sources is completed .",
    "otherwise , we include this source in the final model , then proceed to the next step . in the next step ,",
    "we include another nearby source among the rest of the nearby sources , and repeat the above procedure .",
    "we stop this procedure when the bic reaches the minimum .",
    "finally , we add the target source in the final model .",
    "figure [ fig : objs ] demonstrates the positions of nearby sources selected with this model selection , and these are used for the fitting process .",
    "figures [ fig : func_best ] , [ fig : projx ] and [ fig : projy ] show an example of the best - fit model obtained with the psf - fit tool ; they show the model function , and the projection onto the time and anode directions , respectively .          to demonstrate the efficacy of the psf - fit , we present figure [ fig : j1750 ] .",
    "it shows a light curve of a moderately bright and stable source 4u 1746@xmath137 . due to a periodic contamination of the tail of the psf of a nearby bright source , the light curve available on the website of riken",
