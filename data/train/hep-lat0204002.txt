    "the random vortex surface model @xcite,@xcite is an infrared effective theory which aims to describe the relevant physical fluctuations determining the low - energy nonperturbative sector of the strong interaction .",
    "it is based on collective magnetic vortex degrees of freedom @xcite-@xcite which are represented by closed two - dimensional world - surfaces in four - dimensional ( euclidean ) space - time . the chromomagnetic flux carried by the vortices",
    "is quantized according to the center of the gauge group .",
    "the vortex world - surfaces are treated as random surfaces , an ensemble of which in practice is generated using monte carlo methods on a hypercubic lattice ; the surfaces are composed of elementary squares ( plaquettes ) on that lattice .",
    "the spacing of the lattice is a fixed physical quantity , related to an intrinsic thickness of the vortex fluxes , and represents the ultraviolet cutoff inherent in any infrared effective framework .",
    "this model can be adjusted such as to quantitatively reproduce the confinement properties of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory @xcite , including the finite - temperature transition to the deconfined phase .",
    "it simultaneously predicts a quantitatively correct topological susceptibility , again as a function of temperature @xcite .",
    "the properties of the model vortices closely parallel the ones obtained for vortex configurations extracted from the full @xmath0 lattice yang - mills ensemble using an appropriate gauge fixing and projection procedure @xcite,@xcite , cf .  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate whether also the third central nonperturbative phenomenon determining low - energy strong interaction physics , namely the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , can be correctly described within the random vortex surface model . for this purpose ,",
    "a number of technical developments are carried out .",
    "the coupling of the gluonic vortex degrees of freedom to ( continuum ) quark fields is governed by the dirac operator ; in order to construct this operator , an explicit representation of vortex configurations in terms of continuum gauge fields is needed .",
    "having specified such a representation , matrix elements of the dirac operator can be calculated in a truncated infrared quark basis . via the ( ensemble - averaged ) spectral distribution of the resulting dirac matrix , which is obtained numerically",
    ", the ( quenched ) chiral condensate is extracted ; this condensate can be used as an order parameter for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking . under certain conditions on the explicit vortex gauge field modeling , the chiral condensate as a function of temperature behaves in a manner consistent with @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .    to date , several explorations of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking within the vortex picture have been presented .",
    "one of these lines of investigation @xcite-@xcite deals with the vortex configurations extracted from the full @xmath0 lattice yang - mills ensemble by gauge fixing and projection @xcite,@xcite . removing these vortices from @xmath0 lattice configurations",
    "leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite ; on the other hand , the extracted vortices by themselves break chiral symmetry at zero temperature @xcite . in the chiral limit ,",
    "a divergence of the chiral condensate is observed which is reminiscent of the behavior detected in full @xmath0 yang - mills theory using domain - wall fermions @xcite ; such a divergence will also be observed in the dirac spectra obtained in the present work , cf .",
    "section [ ressec ] .",
    "crossing into the deconfined regime , chiral symmetry remains broken , to an extent which differs qualitatively @xcite from the breaking found in the aforementioned domain - wall fermion calculations . in view of this result , the significance of the chiral condensate induced by vortices and its relation to the condensate obtained in full yang - mills theory remained in doubt . in the present work ,",
    "the behavior of the chiral condensate in the high - temperature regime will turn out to depend strongly on the modeling of the vortex gauge field .",
    "only a sufficiently smooth definition of the gauge field yields a behavior of the chiral condensate consistent with full yang - mills theory .",
    "possibly the vortex extraction procedure used in @xcite endows the vortices with excessive spurious ultraviolet disorder which leads to the unnatural result for the chiral condensate in the deconfined phase .    on the other hand , quite recently an effective vortex model ( in the guise of a @xmath1 gauge theory in the strong coupling limit ) was considered @xcite which to a certain extent follows the logic of the random vortex surface model investigated here . at the expense of a more limited scope of applicability (",
    "the ultraviolet cutoff is e.g.  too low to permit a description of the deconfinement phase transition ) , the dynamics is simplified to the point where analytical estimates of the chiral condensate become possible .",
    "these estimates appear to be close to phenomenologically accepted values _ for the unquenched , dynamical quark case_. however , the extreme limit considered seems rather artificial in that the quenched and the dynamical quark cases yield comparable chiral condensates . presumably , since one possibility of arriving at estimates of the type used in @xcite appears to lie in invoking the large-@xmath2 expansion ( @xmath2 denoting the number of colors ) , this should not come as a surprise ; the large-@xmath2 expansion is by construction quenched to leading order , dynamical quark effects only entering subdominant terms .",
    "by contrast , the quenched chiral condensate obtained in lattice yang - mills theory @xcite exceeds the one expected phenomenologically in the presence of dynamical quarks by about an order of magnitude ; clearly , the quark determinant weighting of the dynamical quark ensemble must be viewed as one of the dominant physical effects in order to reconcile the quenched approximation with the dynamical quark case . in view of this , the meaning of the chiral condensate discussed in @xcite remains unclear , as does the question whether the quoted values in fact support or weaken the basis for that model .",
    "in the applications of the random vortex surface model hitherto considered @xcite,@xcite , it was not necessary to explicitly construct a gauge field associated the vortex configurations arising in the model . to evaluate confinement properties , encoded in wilson loops @xcite ,",
    "it is sufficient to specify the space - time location of the vortex world - surfaces ; to evaluate the topological charge @xcite , it is sufficient to specify the vortex field strength , which is localized on those surfaces . by contrast , construction of the dirac operator implies specifying the gauge field itself .",
    "the freedom inherent in this specification entails ambiguities due to the fact that the concept of an infrared effective model of gauge and quark fields to a certain extent clashes with gauge invariance ; after all , the distinction whether a given configuration is infrared or not is a gauge - dependent one . in an infrared effective model of gauge and quark fields",
    ", manifest gauge invariance can only be sustained with respect to gauge transformations @xmath3 which are themselves infrared .",
    "specifically , when using a truncated basis of quark wave functions ( as will be done in this investigation ) , invariance under a change of the gauge in which the gauge field ensemble is given is only guaranteed to the extent that , for a quark wave function @xmath4 represented in the aforementioned basis , also @xmath5 can be represented to good accuracy in that basis .",
    "conceptually , this is not an obstacle to model - building ; it just implies that a full specification of the model must include a fixed choice of gauge , and that predictive power is curtailed to the extent that observables depend on the precise gauge field modeling . in general",
    ", some observables have to be used to fix the model before additional ones can be predicted .",
    "ideally , the most consistent gauge field description of a given vortex field strength ensemble would be one in which the gauge field is itself as smooth , i.e. infrared , as possible , such as the landau gauge . in practice ,",
    "the choice is constrained by considerations of technical manageability , and also by certain idealizations of the vortex configurations which already occur on the level of the field strengths , cf .  below .",
    "in order to obtain information about the dependence of observables on the construction of the gauge field , in this work different choices will be explored , which , configuration by configuration , describe the same vortex world - surfaces , but are related by gauge transformations which by no means are infrared .",
    "it will turn out that chiral symmetry breaking in the confined phase is quite robust as the modeling of the gauge field is changed ; on the other hand , the dirac spectrum in the deconfined , high temperature phase exhibits a substantial dependence on the gauge field modeling - gratifyingly , the most consistent ( smoothest ) construction turns out to best reproduce the results of full yang - mills measurements .    before proceeding to present the construction of the gauge field in detail , a few remarks are in order concerning the idealizations of the vortex field strengths mentioned further above , which were already introduced in previous considerations of the random vortex surface model .",
    "the vortices hitherto used _ to evaluate observables _ within the model were idealized in two ways : for one , vortex fluxes were taken to be infinitely thin , i.e. the associated world - surfaces are truly two - dimensional , with no transverse thickness in the remaining two space - time directions . note that this idealization is gauge - invariant ; it is a statement about the structure of the modulus of the field strength tr@xmath6 . on the other hand , as a vector in color space , the field strength @xmath7 on vortex surfaces",
    "was taken to point exclusively into the positive or the negative 3-direction ; generic vortex surfaces are non - oriented , i.e. consist of patches of alternating orientation .",
    "note that the color direction of @xmath7 can be changed by gauge transformations ; thus , the configurations hitherto used can be viewed as having been specified in a gauge of the maximally abelian type .",
    "it should be emphasized that these are the properties of the field strengths used _ to evaluate observables _ within the model . by contrast , in the generation of the vortex surface ensemble , a physical thickness of the vortices is indeed implicit @xcite : a _ finite _ action density is associated with vortex surface area and curvature ; infinitely thin vortex fluxes of course formally would carry divergent tr@xmath6 .",
    "also , vortex surfaces can not be packed arbitrarily densely within the model ; instead , there is a fixed ultraviolet cutoff , interpreted as a consequence of the vortex thickness .",
    "the construction and interpretation of the vortex dynamics is discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "the idealized thin vortex configurations described above are , however , entirely sufficient for an unambiguous evaluation of the observables considered to date .",
    "neither the asymptotic string tension @xcite,@xcite nor the topological charge @xcite,@xcite-@xcite depend on any assumption about the transverse structure of the vortex fluxes , i.e.  whether they are thickened or not .",
    "also , both observables are virtually independent of assumptions about the color orientation of the vortex field strength . for the topological charge ,",
    "this is somewhat less obvious than for the wilson loop ; this issue is discussed in detail in @xcite .    on the other hand , in the case of the dirac operator spectrum to be discussed here , the issue is a priori not as clear - cut ; it is therefore necessary to be specific about how the aforementioned idealizations will be dealt with . in the following treatment",
    ", the idealization of thinness of vortex flux will be maintained ; a sufficiently simple and manageable construction of manifestly thick vortex fluxes did not become apparent in the course of this investigation at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "physical vortex fluxes overlap to a considerable extent . ] . instead , a model assumption will be used which is familiar e.g. from the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) quark model .",
    "namely , as already hinted at above , the quark modes will be subject to a fixed ultraviolet cutoff , the same one which is implicit in the model vortex dynamics via the spacing of the lattice on which the vortex surfaces are defined @xcite . in the njl model ,",
    "the quark current - current interaction formally is point - like ; however , the ultraviolet cutoff on the quark modes effectively smears out the four - quark vertex into a nonlocal interaction . in complete analogy , within the present treatment , the interaction between a quark and a vortex formally takes place on an infinitely thin submanifold ( to be specific , a three - dimensional volume , the two - dimensional boundary of which precisely gives the location of the vortex field strength , cf .",
    "section [ locsec ] ) .",
    "however , the ultraviolet cutoff on the quark modes will effectively smear this out in the direction perpendicular to the volume ( and , at its boundary , in the two directions perpendicular to the idealized thin vortex field strength ) .",
    "thus , the thickening of the vortices is not carried out explicitly in the vortex gauge fields , but is effectively accomplished by smearing out the vortex - quark vertex via the ultraviolet cutoff on the quark fields .    turning to the issue of the color orientation of the vortex field strength ,",
    "a more sophisticated approach will be pursued , for the following reason . if one works with a globally defined field strength , pointing either into the positive or the negative 3-direction in color space , and one attempts to globally define an abelian gauge field generating this field strength , then , in the ( generic ) case of nonorientable vortex surfaces , one necessarily introduces dirac string world - surfaces into the description , emanating from the lines on the vortex surfaces at which the orientation switches .",
    "after all , a globally defined ( abelian ) gauge field must satisfy continuity of ( abelian ) magnetic flux .",
    "this would not constitute a problem if one worked with a complete quark basis , i.e.  solved the dirac equation exactly .",
    "then , the quark wave functions would exhibit singularities along the dirac strings which would serve to cancel any physical effect of these strings , i.e.  the dirac strings would be unobservable , as they should be .",
    "however , in any truncated calculation such as will be pursued here , the cancellation would not be perfect ; instead , the dirac strings effectively would act as additional physical magnetic fluxes ( of double magnitude compared with vortex fluxes ) with which the quarks can interact .",
    "thus , more magnetic disorder would be effectively present than the model aims to describe .",
    "the way out of this dilemma lies in instead using a wu - yang construction of the gauge field @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the gauge field will be defined on local patches , which are then related to one another via transition functions on their overlaps ; the transition functions in general will have to be non - abelian .",
    "the patches should be chosen sufficiently small , such that , on any given patch , the vortex surfaces can be oriented ; in this case , no dirac strings arise in the associated abelian gauge field , which is then well - defined on the whole patch .",
    "the reader should however be forewarned that constraints on the space - time form of the transition functions in generic vortex configurations will force the reintroduction of some spurious fluxes ( via additional non - abelian gauge field components ) which are formally similar to dirac strings , but with the _ crucial difference that they manifestly decouple _ from the smooth infrared quark fields .",
    "thus , spurious fluxes are not completely eliminated by the construction presented below ; rather , they are recast in an innocuous form . in practice",
    ", the dirac equation will be solved using the finite element method , i.e. using a basis of localized quark wave functions .",
    "thus , it is natural ( and sufficient ) to use the supports of the individual basis functions , i.e. the finite elements , as the space - time patches on which the gauge field is locally defined .",
    "specifics on these finite elements follow further below .",
    "a closed @xmath0 vortex world - surface @xmath8 along with its quantized chromomagnetic flux can , to a large extent , be characterized by the gauge - invariant property @xmath9 = ( -1)^{l(c , s ) } \\label{lino}\\ ] ] for any wilson loop @xmath10 $ ] linked @xmath11 times , the contour @xmath12 would have to circumscribe @xmath8 at distances larger than this thickness in order to capture the entire vortex flux and not intersect it .",
    "as already discussed further above , in the present treatment , no explicit transverse vortex thickness will be introduced .",
    "thus , such a qualification does not arise . ] to the surface @xmath8 .",

    "it is useful to shift the emphasis of the description @xcite , namely from the closed surfaces @xmath8 to three - dimensional volumes @xmath15 bounded by @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath16 . then ( [ lino ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath9 = ( -1)^{i(c,\\sigma ) } \\label{isno}\\ ] ] in terms of the intersection number ) , it is irrelevant whether one counts intersections without reference to the relative orientation of @xmath15 and @xmath12 , or weighted with a sign according to the orientation .",

    ". the question of how a volume @xmath15 for a given vortex surface @xmath8 can be obtained in practice will be discussed further below ; for the time being , let it be assumed that such a volume has been found ( obviously there is some freedom in choosing @xmath15 , since it merely must satisfy @xmath22 ) .",

    "finally , the color structure of the gauge field is given by the third pauli matrix @xmath33 in ( [ akdef ] ) .",
    "as already discussed in section [ gensec ] , this is a specification which was already adopted previously @xcite,@xcite on the level of the vortex field strengths ; it implies that vortex configurations at this stage are cast in a gauge of the maximally abelian type .",
    "another strong restriction of the gauge freedom is of course implied by the space - time form of ( [ akdef ] ) ; the gauge field only has support on a three - dimensional submanifold made up of elementary three - dimensional cubes in the lattice , i.e. on the subset of cubes @xmath24 with @xmath38 .",
    "below , the definitions will in fact be brought to match even more closely , by viewing those @xmath24 which are associated with @xmath39 , but which nevertheless support a nontrivial gauge field ( such @xmath24 are unavoidable if one wishes to exclude dirac strings , cf .",

    "one of the options one still has lies in the choice of the volume @xmath15 spanning the vortex world - surfaces .",
    "a particular such volume @xmath15 , the construction of which was repeatedly deferred above , can be obtained as follows .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite , monte carlo updates of vortex configurations in the present model are always carried out simultaneously on all six plaquettes making up the surface of an elementary three - dimensional cube in the lattice ; this serves to keep the vortex surfaces closed as they are being updated . as a result",
    ", a volume @xmath15 whose boundary defines the vortex surfaces can be trivially obtained by keeping track of the cubes being updated . to be precise , if one starts with an empty lattice , @xmath93 for all three - dimensional cubes @xmath24 in the lattice ; whenever an update of ( the surface of ) a cube @xmath18 is subsequently accepted , one concomitantly changes @xmath94 . in this way , at any point in the calculation , a viable @xmath15 , made up of the set of @xmath24 with @xmath95 , is known .    on the other hand , this is not the only possible @xmath15 . instead of working directly with the above @xmath15 , which will generally be rather random and rough , it is possible to first apply a smoothing algorithm to @xmath15 . since the only physically relevant information lies in the boundary of @xmath15 , it is admissible to add to @xmath15 , or take away from @xmath15 , arbitrary closed three - volumes . in practice , this implies sweeping through the lattice , considering each elementary four - cube in turn , and simultaneously updating all eight three - cubes @xmath24 making up its boundary , i.e. @xmath96 , whenever this leads to a reduction in the total volume of @xmath15 .",
    "the two options for @xmath15 are related by a ( @xmath1 ) gauge transformation which however does not vary smoothly in space - time .",
    "consequently , invariance of the dirac spectrum is not guaranteed in a calculation using a truncated quark basis , as already mentioned in section [ gensec ] .",
    "thus , the two options represent different possible models which will be explored in the numerical work below ; the options will be referred to as `` random @xmath15 '' and `` smooth @xmath15 '' , respectively .",
    "of course , under the aspect of formulating the gauge field in as smooth a gauge as possible in order to minimize artefacts stemming from rapidly varying gauge transformations , the smooth option seems the preferred one .",
    "the second option one still has in the construction of the gauge field is the following : above , the gauge field @xmath62 is initially constructed independently on each space - time patch . as a result ,",
    "the relative color orientation of adjacent patches , ultimately encoded in the transition functions on the respective overlap regions , is random ; there is a high density of overlap regions supporting nontrivial transition functions .",
    "however , for any given patch , the transformation @xmath97 leads to an equally admissible gauge field on that patch ; this simply corresponds to a gauge transformation @xmath98 constant throughout the patch .",
    "thus , after the initial construction of the gauge field @xmath62 ( but before the addition of the auxiliary gauge field @xmath82 discussed in section [ matsec ] ) , one has the alternative of performing sweeps through the lattice in which one considers a transformation of the gauge field @xmath97 on each individual patch in turn .",
    "acceptance of such a transformation can be biased such that as many as possible of the resulting transition functions to neighboring patches become trivial . in other words ,",
    "the transition functions are made maximally smooth . in the language of",
    "globally defined gauge fields with monopole and dirac string singularities , this corresponds to minimizing the space - time density of such singularities .",
    "accordingly , the option of fixing the gauge field orientation at random on the patches will below be referred to as the `` random monopole '' gauge , whereas the option of maximally smooth transition functions will be referred to as the `` minimal monopole '' gauge .",
    "note that such an alternative , either choosing the monopoles at random or minimizing their density , was already considered in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the topological susceptibility turned out to be virtually independent of the monopole density , a fact which could be understood in terms of the space - time properties of generic vortex surfaces @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "as already indicated further above , the dirac equation will be solved using the finite element method .",
    "this means that the truncated quark basis is constructed using space - time wave functions @xmath99 associated with , and localized around , each lattice site @xmath100 ( the dirac and color structure will be supplemented further below ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath101 is a product over the four space - time directions , @xmath102 and @xmath103 is piecewise linear , @xmath104 where @xmath32 denotes the lattice spacing . to be precise",
    ", the space - time wave function associated with the lattice site @xmath100 takes the form @xmath99 _ on the patch which is simultaneously associated with @xmath100_. viewed from other patches , this form is of course modified by the corresponding transition functions ; after all , the corresponding transition functions can vary rapidly on the very small length scale @xmath77 entering the definition of @xmath74 in ( [ trfel ] ) .",
    "as one moves on such a cube @xmath18 from one lattice site to the next , a general quark wave function , linearly combined from the basis functions , continuously interpolates between a form which is strictly smooth on the patch associated with the initial site to a form which is strictly smooth on the patch associated with the final site .",
    "it should be emphasized that even with this generalized ( not strictly smooth ) ansatz for the quark wave functions , the statement made in connection with eq .",
    "( [ copmix ] ) remains true , i.e.  the auxiliary field @xmath82 cancels in all dirac matrix elements and in this sense does not influence quark propagation .",
    "this follows from the property that the part of the wave function rapidly varying around a given cube @xmath18 , viewed as a function of the coordinate perpendicular to @xmath18 , is symmetric around @xmath18 . as a consistency check ,",
    "if one considers the free dirac equation in patched space - time with nontrivial transition functions and the corresponding auxiliary fields @xmath82 , the dirac matrix is manifestly identical to the one with trivial transition functions . in the framework of the wu - yang construction ,",
    "the transition functions are nothing but a part of the choice of gauge ; the fact that they ( and , as a consequence , the quark wave functions ) are not strictly smooth is merely a specific instance of the model compromise already discussed in section [ gensec ] , namely that the fields in the present construction are not given in the smoothest possible gauge , but that the gauge is partly dictated by considerations of manageability . ] .",
    "an exception to the above form occurs in the case when @xmath100 is located on the boundary where the space - time torus is sewn together , i.e. when at least one of the vector components of @xmath100 , say @xmath105 , vanishes . in this case , the corresponding factor(s ) @xmath106 in ( [ baspro ] ) is ( are ) replaced by @xmath107 in other words , the quark wave functions are forced to obey antiperiodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "physically , this is only really necessary in the euclidean time direction ; the space directions on the other hand should always be taken sufficiently large such that bulk physics does not depend on the behavior at the boundaries .",
    "note that , as far as the torus periodicity is concerned , the gauge fields discussed further above obey periodic boundary conditions ; translation along one of the torus directions by its length leads back to the same patch , with the same gauge field .",
    "a further comment is in order concerning space - times of extent @xmath32 in the euclidean time direction .",
    "while the vortex surfaces and the associated gauge fields can be straightforwardly defined on such a space - time , the truncated quark basis should include the two lowest matsubara frequencies , which are degenerate , on an equal footing .",
    "thus , in practice , while the vortex configurations are still generated on the original lattice with spacing @xmath32 , these configurations are subsequently copied onto a lattice with two spacings @xmath108 in the time direction in order to allow for an ( approximate ) accomodation of both of the basis functions corresponding to the lowest matsubara frequencies .",
    "the above set of wave functions @xmath101 is supplied for each color and dirac component , i.e. the complete quark basis can be labeled as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath111th unit vector in ( two - dimensional ) color space , @xmath112 is the @xmath25th unit vector in ( four - dimensional ) dirac spinor space , and @xmath100 is a site on the space - time lattice .",
    "note that quark wave functions are linearly combined from these basis vectors using , in general , _ complex _ coefficients . in this basis , it is straightforward to calculate analytically the matrix elements of the ( euclidean ) dirac operator @xmath113 using the gauge field @xmath62 constructed in section [ gfsec ] .",
    "this becomes particularly simple when the diverse small lengths introduced in section [ matsec ] are in fact taken to be negligibly small , specifically , the distance separating the two parallel cubes @xmath66 and @xmath67 in eq .",

    "note that the quark basis used here is not orthogonal , i.e. the overlap matrix @xmath119 made up of the matrix elements @xmath120 is not the unit matrix .",
    "thus , to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath121 of the dirac operator , one must solve the matrix equation @xmath122 furthermore , since the square of the dirac operator and the overlap matrix @xmath119 are block - diagonal in the dirac indices , in practice it is advantageous to instead diagonalize the squared dirac operator , i.e.  to consider the equation @xmath123 which is only two - dimensional in dirac spinor space , @xmath124 denoting the matrix of the operator @xmath125 note that the dirac matrix constructed here is manifestly hermitean and chirally symmetric , i.e. its eigenvalues are real , and when they are nonzero , they trivially appear in pairs of opposite sign . on the other hand , since the quark basis is finite - dimensional , no _ exact _ zero - mode solutions occur . as a consequence , the spectrum obtained here by construction strictly only contains the non - zero mode sector of vanishing chirality .",
    "this is different from lattice dirac operators , in which both chiral symmetry is broken and the quark basis is truncated ; the continuum limit then corresponds to a _ combined _ restoration of chiral symmetry and basis completeness - this in principle also allows one to capture exact zero modes in the limit .",
    "by contrast , in the present continuum approach , the limit of exact chiral symmetry is taken already at fixed basis truncation . with this order of limits ,",
    "chiral modes can not be recovered and must be obtained separately by different means .",
    "such an investigation , e.g. via the spectral flow of the dirac operator in the presence of an explicit chiral symmetry - breaking parameter , lies outside the scope of the present work . for the purpose of describing the chiral condensate ,",
    "the exact zero mode sector is irrelevant in the infinite volume limit , simply because the topological susceptibility @xmath126 is a finite quantity ( @xmath127 denotes the topological charge , each unit of which is expected to be associated with a quark zero mode via the atiyah - singer index theorem , and @xmath128 is the space - time volume under consideration ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of the exact zero modes to the total dirac spectral density becomes negligible as @xmath129 .      before applying the construction presented in the previous sections to the configurations of the random vortex surface model ,",

    "note also that , in unquenched calculations , the spectral density near zero eigenvalue will be dynamically suppressed due to the weighting with the determinant of the dirac operator .",
    "nevertheless , the aforementioned instanton model calculations still yield divergent behavior at @xmath147 , which however disappears as @xmath151 such as to yield a finite chiral condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "if the dirac spectrum retains divergent behavior at @xmath147 even in the infinite volume limit , then the issue of the phenomenological relevance of this behavior becomes a subtle quantitative question . in view of ( [ cabaf ] ) , for sufficiently large quark masses the extra contribution to",
    "the chiral condensate resulting from the divergence at @xmath147 becomes negligible and the condensate is dominated by the bulk spectral density .",
    "the question then remains whether realistic quark masses are large or small in this sense .",
    "while this caveat must be kept in mind , further below , numerical values for the chiral condensate will be quoted which correspond to the @xmath147 extrapolation of the bulk of the spectral density , disregarding the enhancement of the spectrum very near @xmath147 .",
    "turning now to the properties of the bulk of the spectrum in more detail , fig .",
    "[ sizfig1 ] displays results for the `` random @xmath15 '' construction of the gauge field with either minimal or random monopoles , respectively . in these cases ,",
    "the bulk value evidently has already converged well to the large volume limit at a spatial extension of the universe corresponding to 4 lattice spacings , i.e. @xmath152fm . in fig .",
    "[ sizfig2 ] , exhibiting results for the `` smooth @xmath15 '' construction with minimal monopoles , the convergence is not quite as fast ; there is still a discrepancy of the order of @xmath153% between the universe with spatial extension @xmath154fm and the universe with spatial extension @xmath155fm , the results in the latter case being indistinguishable from those on larger lattices .",
    "the finite size effects were also considered in a number of other cases : random @xmath15 with random monopoles on @xmath156 lattices in the time direction , a subdivision of the lattice in that direction is introduced when defining the quark basis , in order to accomodate both of the lowest matsubara modes , cf .  section  [ qsec ] . ] , random @xmath15 with minimal monopoles on @xmath157 lattices and on @xmath156 lattices , and smooth @xmath15 with minimal monopoles on @xmath157 lattices .",
    "all these cases displayed a convergence to the large volume limit comparable to or better than the ones exhibited here explicitly .",
    "also in the smooth @xmath15 case with random monopoles , the bulk of the spectrum on a @xmath158 lattice turns out to be indistinguishable from the one on a @xmath159 lattice .    in the following",
    ", dirac spectra will be shown for different choices of the gauge field construction and different temperatures at a spatial extension of the lattice of @xmath152fm .",
    "while one should be aware that this extension in some cases still allows for finite size effects of the order of @xmath153% , it does not suffer from the aforementioned subtlety ( cf .",
    "footnote ) arising for lattices with odd numbers of lattice sites in at least one of the space - time directions , and it also allows for superior statistics compared with extensions corresponding to the next even multiple of the lattice spacing , @xmath160fm . the results are depicted in figs .",
    "[ tfig1]-[tfig3 ] , and also summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "@xmath161    evidently , in the confined phase , all models yield a bulk spectral density which extrapolates to a nonzero value at @xmath147 , thus signaling the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "quantitatively , simultaneously implying a lattice spacing of @xmath162fm in the model with curvature coefficient @xmath143 , cf .",
    "] , the zero - temperature quenched chiral condensate obtained for the different gauge field constructions varies between @xmath163 and @xmath164 . for comparison , the value obtained in lattice yang - mills calculations @xcite corresponds to @xmath165 ( with the zero - temperature string tension fixed to the same value as in the present model ) .",
    "in particular , both of the random @xmath15 models come very close to the lattice yang - mills result .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that the actual value of @xmath148 does not have direct phenomenological meaning , since it is not a renormalization group invariant quantity% @xcite . ] .",
    "only after multiplying with the quark mass , one obtains a physically meaningful quantity which enters e.g.  current algebra relations . in this sense , a measurement of @xmath148 can be viewed as representing no more than an accessory to defining the current quark masses within the model .",
    "however , the fact that the vortex model yields values for the chiral condensate which are not separated from lattice values by unnaturally large factors gives rise to the expectation that this model succeeds in capturing the relevant physics leading to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the confined phase of the strong interaction .",
    "more stringent quantitative tests of low - energy quark physics within the vortex model demand the calculation of additional observables ; this is deferred to future work .",
    "turning now to the behavior of the chiral condensate as one crosses the finite - temperature deconfinement transition , the different models evidently display much larger , qualitative , differences .",
    "the random @xmath15 , random monopole model yields a considerably enhanced chiral condensate in the deconfined phase ; the other models show a reduction of the condensate above the critical temperature . however , this reduction is rather slight , except in the case of the smooth @xmath15 , minimal monopole model .",
    "this latter case is the only one which qualitatively agrees with lattice calculations @xcite : the quenched chiral condensate does not disappear in the deconfined regime , but it is sharply reduced as one crosses the phase transition , cf .",
    "in particular fig .",
    "[ tfig3 ] . in view of the discussion of section [ gensec ] ,",
    "the fact that the smoothest choice of gauge field construction yields the most realistic physics is not unexpected .",
    "this appears to be the model of choice . as discussed above",
    ", the fact that it yields a value for the quenched chiral condensate in the confining phase which is slightly enhanced compared with lattice calculations has no direct phenomenological relevance .",
    "alternatively , one could envisage ultimately using a minimal monopole model which interpolates between the smooth and random @xmath15 cases such as to reproduce the lattice results even more closely .",
    "three fundamental nonperturbative phenomena characterize the low - energy regime of the strong interaction : confinement , the @xmath166 flavor anomaly , and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "while the ( @xmath0 color ) random vortex world - surface model was shown to quantitatively describe the first two of the aforementioned phenomena in @xcite,@xcite , the present work indicates that also the third phenomenon , i.e.  the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , finds a viable description within this model .",
    "specifically , a gauge field construction for vortex world - surface configurations was found which , coupled to quarks , leads to a behavior of the quenched chiral condensate as a function of temperature in qualitative agreement with the behavior found in lattice yang - mills theory .",
    "quantitatively , the quenched chiral condensate @xmath148 differs from the lattice yang - mills result by a factor of the order of unity which presumably can be absorbed into the ultraviolet regularization scheme dependence of the chiral condensate , or , equivalently , into the definition of the current quark mass @xmath150 .",
    "only the product @xmath167 is a renormalization group invariant , physical quantity which can be tested e.g.  using current algebra techniques .",
    "stringent quantitative tests of low - energy quark physics via additional hadronic observables are deferred to future work .",
    "the main thrust of the present investigation lay in developing the technical tools necessary for such work . in order to incorporate quark physics into the vortex model ,",
    "the dirac operator in a vortex background had to be constructed .",
    "this involves , as a prerequisite , casting vortex configurations explicitly in terms of gauge fields .",
    "having appropriately specified such vortex gauge fields via a wu - yang construction , a matrix representation of the dirac operator in a truncated ( finite element ) quark basis was obtained which determines infrared quark propagation in the combined vortex - quark system .",
    "the evaluation of the quenched chiral condensate highlighted above represents a first exploratory application of these techniques .    with the dirac operator at hand",
    ", one can envisage also carrying out dynamical quark calculations within the vortex model , by reweighting the vortex ensemble with the dirac operator determinant .",
    "this will substantially penalize dirac eigenvalues of very small magnitude and thus presumably reduce the chiral condensate to the phenomenologically expected values around @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , to make contact with phenomenology , the random vortex surface model must still be extended to @xmath169 color ; also in the three - color case , lattice yang - mills measurements @xcite indicate that vortex degrees of freedom dominate the infrared , confining sector of the strong interaction .",
