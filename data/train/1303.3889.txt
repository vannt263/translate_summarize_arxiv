    "in the well - accepted paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution from hierarchical structure growth , it is simple enough to reach the conclusion that all massive galaxies should house supermassive black holes ( bhs ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not as simple a task to measure bh masses , growth rates , and their evolution .",
    "bh mass measurements using dynamical methods in quiescent galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite and compilations such as @xcite ) require high spatial resolution and are thus restricted to the local universe . on the other hand , reverberation mapping ( rm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a successful method for directly measuring bh masses in active galaxies .",
    "while not restricted by spatial resolution , reverberation mapping is dependent on temporal resolution .",
    "thus , distance is not a fundamental restriction , but obtaining the long - term observing resources to meet the temporal sampling requirements has logistically driven most reverberation experiments to target lower - luminosity , faster varying agns in the local universe , @xmath5 .",
    "nonetheless , scaling relationships derived from reverberation mapping results of the local agn population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) enable a means for studying bh masses in type 1 ( broad - line ) agns at all redshifts based on single - epoch ( se ) mass estimates .",
    "these se bh mass estimates depend on several assumptions .",
    "first , the luminosity of the agn continuum , measured from the spectrum near a broad emission line of interest , must be a valid proxy for the broad line region radius ( blr ) . in theory",
    ", this is expected because photoionization physics regulates the production of line - emitting photons in such a way that the characteristic radius of emission , @xmath6 , scales tightly with the nuclear luminosity , @xmath7 .",
    "more importantly , direct reverberation mapping measurements of @xmath6 show the expected correlation and provide an empirically well - calibrated @xmath8 relation @xcite .",
    "the indirect blr radius is then combined with a broad emission - line width from at least one broad emission line ( h@xmath9 , h@xmath2 , mgii@xmath10 , or iv1549",
    "civ@xmath0 ) with a calibrated scaling relation .",
    "this width is assumed to be representative of the blr gas velocity under the influence of the gravity of the central black hole . given these assumptions , the virial bh mass is estimated by @xmath11 , where @xmath6 scales as @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the velocity dispersion of the blr gas , @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath15 is a dimensionless factor of order unity accounting for the unknown blr geometry and kinematics and determined from local calibrations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at redshifts @xmath16 , all emission lines but iv1549 civ@xmath0",
    "have redshifted out of the optical observing window , making it the only emission line available for high-@xmath17 bh and galaxy evolution studies using ground - based optical data .",
    "however , several past studies have claimed that iv civ  is an unreliable virial mass indicator ( e.g. , ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter n07 ; @xcite ; ) due to large scatter and possible offsets in the iv civ  based masses compared to h@xmath9 , h@xmath2 , or mgii . the most wide - spread , physically motivated argument against iv civ  is tied to the commonly observed blueward asymmetries , enhancements , and velocity shifts of the iv civ  line profile .",
    "it has been suggested that these observed properties are the result of non - virial motions of the iv civ - emitting gas ( i.e. , outflows , winds , and non - gravitational forces ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rendering iv civ  velocity width measurements unsuitable for estimating bh masses .",
    "we should note , however , that as with stellar winds , any radiatively driven wind will result in a velocity comparable to the escape velocity @xcite , which is close enough to the virial velocity that it is unlikely to be a considerable issue given the other uncertainties in the problem .",
    "other studies have found general consistency between single - epoch iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter vp06 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter a11 ) , suggesting that any biases are modest .",
    "the only way to definitively probe the iv civ  blr kinematics and search for potential non - virial motions is using reverberation mapping experiments of the iv civ  emission .",
    "these experiments isolate the photoionized , and apparently virialized @xcite , gas in the blr that is responding to the continuum variability from other non - variable emission components .",
    "further constraints on the geometry and kinematics are then possible with two - dimensional velocity  delay maps ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but unambiguous maps have yet to be constructed for this emission line ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nonetheless , available reverberation mapping results for iv civ  yield consistent results with those of the other emission lines observed in the same objects @xcite , so any issues are restricted to se estimates using iv civ , rather than iv civ  in general .",
    "one concern contributing to the iv civ  debate is that sample selection may be a problem .",
    "for example , vp06 studied only local reverberation - mapped agns .",
    "@xcite show that this sample does not span the full iv civ  equivalent width / blueshift parameter space observed for sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasars , suggesting that the results may not be representative of the overall high - redshift quasar population , and raise the concern that bh mass scaling relationships calibrated only with low blueshift sources may not be applicable to the large blueshift , low equivalent width ( `` wind - dominated '' ) sources .",
    "on the other hand , the vp06 reverberation mapping sample spans a rest - uv luminosity range of 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is much larger than most studies ( e.g. , n07 ; @xcite , hereafter d09 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , making it far easier to recognize the existence of an underlying correlation in the presence of noise .",
    "indeed , the studies finding little or no correlation ( e.g. , d09 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) first restrict the sample to such a narrow luminosity range that no correlation would be found for any estimator , including h@xmath2 .",
    "a11 pointed out that roughly half of the ` problem ' has nothing to do with the line widths but comes from the variance between the continuum estimates rather than the line structure .",
    "@xcite then argued that much of the discrepancy due to the line widths between h@xmath2  and iv civ - based se bh mass estimates is due to a non - variable component of the iv civ  emission - line that biases the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) line widths often used to derive the se bh mass .",
    "since the component biasing the fwhm seems not to reverberate , direct bh mass measurements based on reverberation mapping are unaffected , leading to the better agreement with results for h@xmath2 .",
    "iv civ  supporters also argue that data quality is a key factor : vp06 largely used high-@xmath1 _ hst _ spectra or an average reverberation mapping campaign spectrum , and a11 obtained new or previously published high-@xmath1 iv civ  spectra of all their targets .",
    "most studies instead use iv civ  observations in lower @xmath1 survey spectra , such as from sdss .",
    "vp06 , a11 , and @xcite demonstrate ( 1 ) that the scatter in the iv civ - to - h@xmath2  masses or line widths is reduced when low-@xmath1 spectral data are removed , and ( 2 ) that low @xmath1 can mask absorption in the iv civ  line profile , leading to some of the highly discrepant iv civ - to - h@xmath2  masses of n07 and . even without these complicating issues , the uncertainty in the velocity field of the blr gas , as derived from a se line - width characterization , is _ already _ the largest source of systematic uncertainty in se mass estimates due to the unknown geometry , kinematics , and inclination of the blr @xcite . when width measurements are routinely made from survey data of varying quality , these uncertainties are enhanced .",
    "these fractional velocity errors are magnified in the mass estimates that depend on @xmath18 .",
    "se bh mass measurements are used to draw conclusions about black hole demographics , growth rates , blr gas kinematics , accretion and feedback physics , and the evolution of all these properties across cosmic time .",
    "a clear understanding of the effects that data quality and analysis practices have on the accuracy and precision of these line width measurements and bh mass estimates is therefore crucial . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to reconcile the evidence and arguments on both sides of this debate as to the reliability of bh mass estimates based on iv civ  in the context of data quality .",
    "we first select one of the studies that ( 1 ) conclude that iv civ  is a poor virial mass estimator based on a large scatter between iv civ- and h@xmath2-based black hole masses ( albeit over a very limited dynamic range in luminosity ) , and ( 2 ) base their conclusion solely on survey - quality ( i.e. , typically low @xmath1 ) data of the iv civ  line . for this , we select the work of n07 , who present a sample of 15 high-@xmath17 quasars with iv civ  masses based on spectra from sdss and h@xmath2  masses determined using gemini near - infrared spectrograph observations . by obtaining new , high-@xmath1 spectra of a portion of this sample and combining it with other high - quality data from the literature , we investigate whether data quality can explain the discrepancy between iv civ- and h@xmath2-based bh mass estimates .",
    "we define high - quality spectra as those with @xmath1910 pixel@xmath20 measured in an emission - line - free region of the continuum ( @xmath41450  or @xmath41700  in the rest frame ) .    in section [ s_data ] , we present spectra of six high - redshift quasars from the n07 sample observed with the first of the multi - object double spectrographs ( mods1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) and give details of the additional samples we select from the literature and public archives to increase our total sample size to 47 agns . in section [ s_fitswidths ]",
    "we describe how we fit the iv civline profiles , and section [ s_widthsmasses ] describes our line width , luminosity , and bh mass measurements .",
    "we then compare the iv civand h@xmath2  masses derived from our high - quality sample in section [ s_impactsnonmass ] . in section [ s_discussion ] we discuss the impact data quality has on ( 1 ) the presence of absorption in the iv civprofile , ( 2 ) the iv civ  line width measurements , and ( 3 ) the se iv civ  bh masses in relation to h@xmath2  masses . a summary and concluding remarks are given in section [ s_conclusion ] .",
    "we used the mods1 spectrograph on the lbt to obtain rest - frame uv spectra of six of the 15 high - redshift quasars presented by n07 ( table [ tab_observations ] ; we will refer to targets by the leading digits in their names , e.g. , j0254 for sdss j025438.37 + 002132.8 ) .",
    "these six quasars were chosen from the full n07 sample because of their favorable location on the sky during our observing runs rather than their particular spectral properties or iv civ  versus h@xmath2 mass estimates .    for each quasar we used either the red or blue channel of mods1 without the dichroic , depending on the observed wavelength of the redshifted @xmath211549 emission line .",
    "the blue - channel spectra used the g400l grating ( 400linesmm@xmath20 in first order ) , and the red - channel spectra used the g670l grating ( 250linesmm@xmath20 in first order ) with a gg495 order blocking filter .",
    "for all spectra we used the 06 segmented long - slit mask ( ls5x60x0.6 ) , centering the quasar in the slit .",
    "this slit width gives a nominal resolution of @xmath222000 , with wavelength coverage from 3200@xmath236000  in the blue channel and 6000@xmath2310000  in the red channel .",
    "all of the quasars were observed near meridian crossing so we did not need to orient the slit along the parallactic angle to minimize the effects of differential atmospheric refraction ( mods does not have an atmospheric dispersion corrector ) . multiple exposures ( 3 or 4 ) were used to control for cosmic rays .",
    "the observations and observing conditions are summarized in table [ tab_observations ] .",
    "after processing the images using mods - specific two - dimensional calibration procedures ( bias and flat field ) , the spectra were extracted and then wavelength and flux calibrated using standard procedures in the iraf twodspec and onedspec packages .",
    "the spectral resolution of the mods1-blue ( -red ) channel targets is roughly 2.2  ( 3.5 ) near the emission line .",
    "we resampled the spectra of j0254 , j1055 , j1159 , and j1537 onto a linear wavelengths scale with 0.5pixel@xmath20 , and j2102 and j2103 onto a linear wavelength scale with 0.75pixel@xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig : modsfull ] shows the mods1 spectra of our six targets .",
    "although spectrophotometric standard stars were observed as part of the overall queue observing programs for the nights , the variable observing conditions resulted in an unreliable absolute flux calibration .",
    "thus , the spectra in figure [ fig : modsfull ] are in uncalibrated @xmath24 units . unfortunately , telluric standards were also not observed .",
    "telluric absorption is present to some degree in the iv civprofiles of all targets except j0254 ; however , it is typically only present in the line wing and does not hinder our ability to model the line profile or measure the line width .",
    "the exceptions to this are for j1159 and j1537 . in the case of j1159 , we did not include corrections because of the proximity of the absorption to the profile peak plus the additional intrinsic ( or intervening ) absorption . for j1537 ,",
    "the spectrophotometric standard taken the same night differed in airmass by only @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore performed a crude correction for the o@xmath26 a - band and b - band by dividing the standard star spectrum with templates derived from the hst calspec database and then using the noao onedspec package telluric task to scale the telluric correction . some residual absorption at the optically thick , and therefore nonlinear",
    ", core of the o@xmath26 band head remains due to the imperfect match in seeing and/or airmass , but we later masked any remaining telluric absorption when we fit the iv civ  profiles ( see section [ s_fitswidths ] ) .    in order to make a meaningful comparison with the original sdss spectra , we performed a homogeneous analysis of both the original sdss spectra and the mods1 spectra of these six quasars .",
    "the sdss spectra were rebinned to a linear wavelength dispersion consistent with the pixel size at restframe @xmath211549  in each sdss spectrum .",
    "this resulted in dispersions of 1.2  pixel@xmath20 for j0254 , and 1.5pixel@xmath20 for j1055 , j1159 , j1537 , j2102 , and j2103 .",
    "the spectral resolution in this region was calculated to be 2.22.3  for all sources .",
    "we expand our sample of high @xmath1 spectra by including three additional samples .",
    "first , we use eight objects from a11 , excluding the broad - absorption line quasar h1413 + 117 and objects classified as having group ii , poorer quality , line widths ( see a11 table 3 and section 3 ) .",
    "second , we include six of the 10 objects presented by d09 that fit our quality requirement of @xmath27 pix@xmath20 and do not have a broad absorption - line region obscuring the blue side of the iv civ  profile .",
    "third , we fully reanalyze all the high @xmath1 uv spectra of the reverberation mapping sample ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the mast archives .",
    "much of this sample overlaps with that presented by vp06 , but we have updated it with recent high - resolution spectra taken with either the _ hst _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) or space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) . in a limited number of cases , we averaged multiple epochs that were closely spaced in time to increase the @xmath1 , but we otherwise dropped spectra / targets that did not meet our @xmath1 requirement , leaving 27 objects in the rm sample .",
    "our full sample therefore contains 47 objects .",
    "figure [ fig : samplestats ] shows the redshift and uv luminosity distributions and the relation between iv civblueshift@xmath28  emission lines . ] and equivalent width ( discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for our sample .",
    "the former two distributions ( left and center panels of figure [ fig : samplestats ] ) demonstrate that our sample , though not large by survey standards , spans redshifts 0@xmath173.5 and five orders of magnitude in agn luminosity .",
    "the right panel shows that while this sample spans a broad range of iv civ  equivalent widths ( eqw ) , there is , unfortunately , still only one object  q2302 from the d09 sample  that has a low iv civeqw _ and _ a large blueshift .",
    "it is , however , an extreme example of this phenomenon .",
    "there is no universally accepted method for separating the various blended components of emission in agn spectra or for setting line boundaries for measuring emission - line widths ( see , e.g. , a11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that fitting functional forms to the h@xmath2  profile can exacerbate , rather than mitigate , systematic problems in the h@xmath2line width measurements . in general ,",
    "this is true only of low @xmath1 data , and is therefore not a concern here .",
    "regardless of data quality , reliably measuring the iv civ  line widths _ without _ a model for the intrinsic line shape is impossible in the presence of absorption in the line profile and blending with the `` red shelf '' emission often seen between iv civ  and heii  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "using functional fits is therefore a common practice under these circumstances , and thus , utilized here .",
    "we chose a simple approach for fitting the iv civ  emission region that closely follows the `` prescription a '' approach described by a11 and the continuum fitting of @xcite methods ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we fit and subtract a linear local continuum , fitting to a region blueward of iv civ(rest wavelength @xmath41450 , or @xmath41350  in a few cases where the @xmath41450  region is contaminated by absorption ) and redward of heii @xmath211640 and oiii ] @xmath211663 ( at @xmath41700 ) . by selecting the continuum windows this way",
    ", the red shelf lies within our fitting window .",
    "we do not assume an origin for this emission for our fits .",
    "instead , we set our redward iv civ  line boundary well into the red shelf and mask out the wavelength region covered by the red shelf during the fit .",
    "we select this region independently for each object , but typically start the mask between @xmath41580@xmath231600  and extend it to the red edge of oiii ] , @xmath41690 .",
    "we also mask out any absorption regions and niv]@xmath211486 emission , when it is observed .",
    "we then fit the unmasked regions of the continuum - subtracted iv civ  line profiles with sixth - order gauss - hermite ( gh ) polynomials using the normalization of @xcite and the functional forms of @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting coefficients are determined with a levenberg - marquardt least - squares fitting procedure .",
    "constraints from the _ unmasked _ line and continuum regions provide interpolation through the _ masked _ regions .",
    "this approach minimizes the number of components that are fit to the spectra , minimizing problems that can be introduced by the use of multiple model fits to blended emission components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we do not constrain the number of gh fit components required to reproduce the observed iv civ  profile , although typically , only two components are required .",
    "we do not attribute individual fit components to kinematically distinct regions ( e.g. , narrow - line region ( nlr ) as compared to blr components ) .",
    "some studies remove a narrow - line component , under the assumption that this emission arises in a low - density , extended kiloparsec - scale nlr .",
    "based on the arguments by @xcite , including a demonstration that the non - reverberating , low - velocity component of the iv civ  line is much broader than the oiii@xmath215007 narrow emission line , we do not do so , and we use the full composite fit for our iv civ  line width measurements .      using these procedures",
    ", we fit both the mods1 and sdss spectra of the n07 sample .",
    "our goal in refitting the latter is ( 1 ) to attempt to reproduce the line widths quoted by n07 based on these spectra , and ( 2 ) to make a meaningful comparison between these survey quality spectra and the high quality mods1 spectra using the same modeling procedures . while profile fits can introduce systematics into the measured iv civwidths of the low @xmath1 sdss spectra , direct measurements of either the fwhm or line dispersion at these low signal - to - noise ratios are more systematically uncertain than those made using parametric fits @xcite .",
    "exceptions to this standard fitting procedure were required for the mods1 spectrum of j1159 and the sdss spectrum of j0254 .",
    "the mods1 spectrum of j1159 ( figure [ fig : modssamplecivfits1 ] ) shows significant absorption across the peak ( both intrinsic and atmospheric ) , that prevents convergence to a physically - plausible gh - fit model .",
    "instead , we used multiple lorentzian profiles to fit the wings of the line profile , constraining the peak amplitude and wavelength by the slope of the line wings and the functional form of the lorentzian profile . for the sdss spectrum of j0254 , we also did not achieve an acceptable gh polynomial fit , likely due to a combination of low @xmath1 , the apparent absorption , and asymmetry in this profile .",
    "we obtained a somewhat more representative profile with two gaussian components , in which the broader component is blueshifted relative to the narrower component .    the solid black curves in figures [ fig : modssamplecivfits1 ] and [ fig : modssamplecivfits2 ] show the final models ( black ) for each spectrum ( gray ) . for comparison ,",
    "the horizontal black bar above the iv civ  profile in the top ( sdss ) panels of figures [ fig : modssamplecivfits1 ] and [ fig : modssamplecivfits2 ] represent the fwhm values given by n07 .",
    "these bars are centered at the half maximum flux level and the theoretical iv civ  line center .",
    "n07 do not provide a description of how the line widths were measured or their uncertainties , so a direct comparison is not possible .",
    "we fit the spectra for the other samples in the same standard manner given above .",

    "the iv civ  profile fits and exceptions to our standard fitting method for the a11 sample can be found in that work .",
    "the exceptions for the d09 and rm samples are :    * [ hb89 ] 0150 - 202 : * there is an unexplained , yet sharp , difference in the continuum slope on either side of the dichroic , just redward of the iv civ  line .",

    "uncertainties in the luminosity were determined from the standard deviation of the luminosities measured from the resampled spectral models used for estimating uncertainties in the line widths . for objects with multiple epochs ,",
    "we calculate the fwhm- and @xmath32-based iv civ  mass from the uncertainty weighted geometric mean from all se ( or rm campaign mean spectrum ) mass estimates .",
    "the uncertainty in this mean mass is taken to be the quadrature sum of the standard deviation about the unweighted mean mass and the weighted measurement uncertainty on the weighted mean mass .",

    "consequently , the rm bh mass measurement differed by approximately an order of magnitude between the two campaigns .",
    "furthermore , this object exhibits complex , often double- or even triple - peaked broad emission line profiles , raising questions as to the best way to define a characteristic , mean velocity from such complex profiles . for this reason , the h@xmath2  mass , and therefore possibly the iv civ  mass , for this object is likely unreliable . ] .",
    "there is also a zero - point offset between the observed mean of each iv civ  mass distribution and that of equality with the h@xmath2  masses .",
    "this offset is related to the zero - point calibration of the se iv civ  mass scale taken from vp06 and is simply due to the prescriptional differences between our line width measurements and those of vp06 .",
    "this type of zero - point calibration issue does not affect our results .",
    "in addition , while we have taken care to place all of the h@xmath2  masses on the same mass scale , the line widths and luminosities or lags were taken from the literature and were not measured with a homogeneous method .",
    "this likely adds additional scatter to the comparisons shown in figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] that is not associated in any way with iv civ .",
    "nonetheless , since both the top and bottom panels use the same h@xmath2  masses , this does not affect the relative difference in scatter between the iv civ  fwhm- and @xmath32-based masses shown here .",
    "a simple qualitative comparison of the noisy sdss and mods1 spectra shown in figures [ fig : modssamplecivfits1 ] and [ fig : modssamplecivfits2 ] clearly demonstrates the deleterious effects low quality data can have on our ability to accurately describe quasar emission line properties . using this comparison and our results above",
    ", we discuss the effects of data quality on characterizing absorption , the iv civ  velocity width , and se iv civ  bh mass estimates .",
    "one striking characteristic of even the small sample of objects observed with both sdss and mods1 is the prevalence of narrow absorption features in the iv civ  profiles . because iv1549 civ@xmath0",
    "is a resonance transition , self - absorption is common ( @xmath3350% ) , and it is usually in the form of narrow absorption lines ( nals ) due to gas associated with the quasar and/or along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recognizing the presence and extent of nal features in low quality data with a high level of confidence is difficult or impossible .",
    "this was demonstrated by a11 for another of the n07 targets ( sdss1151 + 0340 ) where an absorption feature was missed in the sdss spectrum .",
    "we see here that the opposite is also possible , as we misidentified noise in the sdss spectrum of j0254 ( figure [ fig : modssamplecivfits1 ] , top left ) near 1510  and 1515  as absorption , and our fit was affected by this assumption .",
    "correctly identifying and modeling intrinsic absorption is absolutely necessary for measuring accurate iv civ  bh masses .    with high @xmath1 and relatively high spectral resolution data , where the _ presence _ of absorption can be accurately detected",
    ", the absorption features can usually be masked and interpolated across with relatively few consequences for the line widths and masses .",
    "however , when the absorption occurs at the peak of the iv civ  emission line , it is difficult to know how well an arbitrarily defined profile based on a functional fit reproduces the intrinsic emission - line profile and peak amplitude .",
    "there is simply no a priori expectation for the detailed line shapes of individual agns .",
    "we have marked objects with absorption observed across the iv civ  emission line peak as red points in figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] to show the possible contribution of line peak absorption to the observed scatter in the masses .",
    "we find that the distribution of objects with absorbed peaks is not systematically different that of the unabsorbed objects with respect to the mean iv civ  to h@xmath2  mass ratio , and the scatter in the iv civ  to h@xmath2  mass residuals found for our sample actually marginally increases upon omission of these objects from the full sample , from 0.47 to 0.49 dex and 0.29 to 0.30 dex for fwhm- and @xmath32-based iv civ  masses , respectively .",
    "the change in scatter after omitting the 12 absorbed - peak objects is small and could simply be due to small number statistics .",
    "in general , however , masses estimated from absorbed - peak profiles using @xmath32 will be less prone to biases in the width measurement than fwhm - based mass estimates , because of the relative insensitivity of the line dispersion measurement to the profile peak amplitude .",
    "in contrast , absorption and the resulting interpolation uncertainties across the profile peak is more likely to bias fwhm measurements , which _ are _ very sensitive to the amplitude of the emission - line peak .",
    "a likely explanation for the lack of additional scatter ( and even a slight reduction in the scatter ) in the masses because of absorbed - peak objects , here , is that the iv civ  line peak is already contaminated by the non - variable emission component described by @xcite .",
    "interpolating over the absorbed peak with gaussian or gauss - hermite functions is more likely to underestimate than overestimate the peak amplitude @xcite , particularly for the relatively more contaminated , ` peaky ' iv civ  profiles .",
    "this would , fortuitously , reduce the contamination of this component to the width measurement , leading , in these random cases , to a more accurate iv civ  mass estimate .",
    "this should be the case , in general , but is even more likely to occur with fwhm - based masses , and we do measure the marginally larger difference in scatter in the fwhm - based masses between inclusion or omission of the absorbed - peak objects .",
    "the reliability of iv civ  masses has been debated in the literature not only as a result of the large scatter typically observed between iv civand h@xmath2  masses themselves , but also because of the lack of correlation observed between iv civ  line widths and those of other broad emission lines .",
    "the closed points in the left panel of figure [ fig : widthcompare ] shows a similar result from our own data .",
    "here we have used the h@xmath2  line widths from @xcite for the mean spectrum of the rm sample objects in order to be more consistent with using a se iv civ  line width .",
    "also , we adopt the mean and standard deviation of the iv civ  fwhm for objects with more than one epoch of data . in general , the iv civ  line width is expected to be broader than h@xmath2  because of the ionization stratification of the blr .",
    "however , the values shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : widthcompare ] scatter both above and below the line of equal iv civ  and h@xmath2  widths .",
    "this indicates that characterizing the high - ionization blr gas velocity using the iv civ  fwhm from a se spectrum does not support the physical , virial expectations from an ionization - stratified blr under the gravitational influence of the bh . on the other hand ,",
    "the open points compare the iv civ  and h@xmath2  fwhm measured in the rms spectrum and taken from @xcite and @xcite for each line , respectively , for the six objects that have both iv civ  and h@xmath2  rm measurements : 3c390.3 , fairall 9 , ngc3783 , ngc4151 , ngc 7469 , and ngc5548 ( for which we have two independent measurements of both iv civand h@xmath2 ) .",
    "when sampling only the reverberating gas velocities , the expectation from a virialized and ionization stratified blr holds for all objects but fairall 9 , but in this case , the rms iv civ  profile is weak and likely contaminated by noise , so the fwhm measurement should not be trusted ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar studies in the literature have exclusively focused on comparing fwhm measurements .",
    "however , the right panel of figure [ fig : widthcompare ] shows a similar width comparison using the line dispersion to characterize both the h@xmath2  and iv civ  line widths for the objects with available h@xmath2  @xmath32 measurements . in this case , the relation between iv civ  and h@xmath2  velocities _ do _ follow the virial expectation , even with using the se line widths : the iv civline widths are exclusively larger than the h@xmath2widths also shows the greatest consistency with virial expectations for the correlation between the blr velocity and radius @xcite .",
    "it is thus the preferred line width characterization for rm studies . ] .",
    "note , however , that a tight correlation is not necessarily expected here because the iv civ  and h@xmath2  widths are not measured from simultaneous epochs ; intrinsic variability creates scatter , since virial expectations imply @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is significant ( @xmath331dex ) for some of the rm sample objects between the iv civ  and h@xmath2  observations .",
    "the level of scatter in figure [ fig : widthcompare ] is therefore likely inflated , compared to typical expectations for high-@xmath7 qsos , because the sample is dominated by the lower - luminosity , more variable rm sample .",
    "an additional consideration is that the ratio between the iv civ  and h@xmath2  velocity widths may depend on the specifics of the blr structure and accretion rate , leading to some intrinsic scatter between objects .",
    "rm time delays for the few objects with both h@xmath2  and iv civ  results show that the iv civ  response is typically @xmath41 times shorter than the h@xmath2  response , and the lag and line width follow virial expectations @xcite , but this sample consists of only a handful of intermediate luminosity agns .    an additional argument against using the fwhm to derive se iv civ  masses",
    "was presented by @xcite and follows from the results in the left panel of figure [ fig : widthcompare ] .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there is an emission component in the se iv civ  profile that is non - variable and therefore does not seem to be emitted from the same velocity distribution of blr gas that reverberates in response to the continuum emission .",
    "this non - variable component is likely responsible for the ` peaky ' low - velocity core seen in many iv civprofiles ( although the non - variable emission may also be present in an additional , or alternate , blue - shifted , broader component ) .",
    "its presence can significantly contaminate the blr velocity width measurement when characterizing the se iv civ  line profile with the fwhm .",
    "this bias is likely responsible for much of the excess scatter seen in our sample when using the fwhm to derive iv civ  masses and explains why the iv civ  fwhm measured from the se spectrum is often narrower than the h@xmath2  fwhm ( although figure [ fig : widthcompare ] demonstrates the same is not true when using the rms spectrum where this component is not present ) .",
    "thus , despite the problem of absorption , it appears that data quality is not the _ leading _ cause of scatter between fwhm - based bh mass measurements , though there is some effect ( see figure [ fig : n07samplemasscompare ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the line dispersion , @xmath32 , is not as sensitive to the line peak as the fwhm and is therefore less affected by any contamination from the non - variable iv civ  emission component ( although strictly speaking , there must be an effect on some level ) .",
    "the additional insensitivity of @xmath32 to absorption in the line peak is another advantage of this line width characterization .",
    "however , @xmath32 is sensitive to correctly characterizing the wings of the lines , and as such , is very sensitive to @xmath1 . in low @xmath1 spectra",
    ", it is difficult , if not impossible , to accurately define the boundaries of the emission line and characterize the intrinsic line shape as it merges with a noisy continuum level .",
    "a comparison between the sdss and mods1 spectrum of j2102 shown in figure [ fig : modssamplecivfits2 ] clearly demonstrates the improved clarity with which the wings and extent of the iv civprofile can be distinguished from the continuum in high @xmath1 data as opposed to survey - quality data .",
    "unfortunately , the limiting @xmath1 required to accurately trace the intrinsic profile is somewhat dependent on the iv civ  line shape .",
    "the more ` boxy ' , low equivalent width profiles , such as j1055 and j1537 , can be more accurately fit in lower @xmath1 data than the ` peaky ' , extended - wing profiles like j2102 because of the relative extension and contrast of the wings compared to the noise level in the continuum .    mass estimates based on @xmath32 are clearly superior to those based on the fwhm with the caveat that @xmath32 is sensitive to blending in the line wings , so high quality data are required .",
    "this can be a significant source of bias in using @xmath32 for h@xmath2  widths @xcite .",
    "this could be a source of bias for iv civ  as well , as the source of the blended red shelf emission is still uncertain , and misattributing the origin of this emission could bias the resulting iv civ  @xmath32 measurement ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , applying a homogeneous spectral decomposition and line width measurement procedure to measure @xmath32 can produce consistent @xmath32 measurements that lead to little scatter in iv civ  mass estimates as compared to h@xmath2 .",
    "as usual , care must be taken in combining samples in order to mitigate scatter resulting from the use of different methodology .",
    "higher data quality makes a clear positive impact on the consistency between se iv civ  and h@xmath2  bh masses when using the line dispersion to characterize the iv civ  velocity field .",
    "this is demonstrated by the significant reduction in scatter between the low ( sdss ) and high ( mods1 ) quality @xmath32-based iv civ  masses of the n07 sample ( see section [ s_impactsnonmass ] and figure [ fig : n07samplemasscompare ] ) . furthermore , the scatter of only 0.29dex between the iv civ@xmath32-based masses and h@xmath2  masses , measured across our full sample of _ high quality _ data shown in figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] , is arguably the lowest so far quoted in the literature between iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses for a sample this size , particularly since this ( 1 ) does not depend on any type of empirical , potentially sample - dependent , correction , ( 2 ) does not factor in the evidence from a11 that a continuum color correction is a comparable contributor to this scatter , and ( 3 ) does not take into account inhomogeneities in how the h@xmath2  line widths were measured or other systematics that may be associated with the h@xmath2  mass estimates , which is outside the scope of this work .",
    "another relatively direct piece of evidence for the ability of data quality to reduce the scatter between @xmath32-based iv civ  masses is to look at the rm sample .",
    "we measure this scatter to be 0.28dex in our high - quality rm sample .",
    "vp06 , whose sample largely overlaps with our own but is more heterogeneous in quality , quote a scatter of 0.37dex when using weighted averages of the multiple se iv civmasses and h@xmath2  rm campaign masses .",
    "the difference between our results and that of vp06 is due in part to data quality differences ( see also discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "there are also differences in our spectral analysis and line width measurement methods compared to those of vp06 that may contribute to the reduced scatter .",
    "we have learned a lot about the sources of systematic problems in line width measurements since the vp06 study ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is not surprising that our reanalysis of this sample has fewer systematic problems .",
    "conversely , when considering fwhm - based se iv civ  mass estimates , our results indicate that obtaining high quality data only marginally improves the consistency between iv civ  and h@xmath2  se mass estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : n07samplemasscompare ] shows a consistently large scatter between h@xmath2  and fwhm - based iv civ  masses for both low and high quality data , and our results from the top panel of figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] including the full sample of high - quality data corroborate this finding .",
    "we can again make a comparison to the vp06 results for the rm sample to look at the differences in scatter between our high - quality data set and their heterogeneous - quality data set . vp06 quote a scatter of 0.43dex , while we find a scatter of 0.36dex .",
    "there is some improvement , but again prescriptional differences could play a part in this difference as well .    finally , it is still difficult with our sample to address the concerns of @xcite regarding the applicability of existing iv civ  se mass scaling relationships to quasars covering the complete iv civeqw  blueshift parameter space observed for sdss quasars .",
    "while our sample covers more than an order of magnitude in iv civ  eqws , we still only have one source with a low iv civ  eqw and a large iv civ  blueshift ( see figure [ fig : samplestats ] ) .",
    "this is q2302 from the d09 sample , and it is the object found to have the largest estimated iv civ  mass in our sample . q2302 does appear as a significant outlier in the top panel of figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] when its mass is estimated using the iv civ  fwhm , again suggesting that fwhm - based iv civ  masses may less reliable , but it is no larger an outlier than other sources without large iv civ  blueshifts .",
    "when the iv civ  mass is estimated with @xmath32 , it also falls within the same , albeit much smaller , range of scatter as the rest of the sample .",
    "more low iv civ  eqw  large blueshift objects should be specifically targeted for both se mass comparisons and rm studies to be able to address this concern further .",
    "the analysis and results presented above are based on the iv civ  mass scale calibrated by vp06 .",
    "after completion and initial submission of this current work , an updated calibration of the iv civ  mass scale became available ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p13 ) .",
    "the new calibration of p13 differs from that of vp06 in two main respects : p13 ( 1 ) incorporates the most up - to - date database of high quality _ hst _ spectra of the reverberation mapping sample ( essentially the same sample we use here ) , while excluding low quality spectra altogether , and ( 2 ) relaxes the @xmath42 virial expectation , which improves the empirical calibration of the fwhm - based iv civ  masses ( see p13 for details ) .",
    "we have recalculated our iv civ  masses using the p13 iv civ  mass scaling relationships to evaluate if the consistency between iv civ  and h@xmath2masses improves with these updated iv civ  mass scaling relations .",
    "figure [ fig : newmassscale ] shows the comparison of iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses that is equivalent to figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] but using equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of p13 .",
    "the most significant difference between our previous results and those utilizing these updated iv civ  mass scale calibrations is that the scatter between the iv civ  fwhm - based masses and the h@xmath2  masses is significantly smaller .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath43 dependence on @xmath44 instead of the virial expectation of @xmath45 , which helps to correct for line width dependent biases ; it effectively applies a line - width dependent scale factor to the masses . for iv civ",
    "this corrects for the varying amounts of contamination by the non - variable iv civ  emission component , which is a function of the iv civ  fwhm ( see * ? ? ?",
    ". such an empirical calibration may be the answer for survey quality data , from which a measurement of the fwhm is easier to make and more robust than @xmath32 to @xmath1 , but this type of calibration is strongly sample dependent , particularly on the distribution of iv civ  line shapes present in the calibration sample , and the rm sample is relatively small and not yet representative of the overall quasar population in this respect , so caution interpreting the results of its application is necessary .",
    "p13 find that a similar relaxation of the virial dependence for @xmath32-based iv civ  masses is not warranted , and the p13 calibration for @xmath32-based iv civ  masses is very similar to the vp06 calibration .",
    "we do not see any significant improvement in the consistency between the @xmath32-based iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses using the new calibration ; the scatter was unaffected .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath32 based masses continue to more consistently reproduce h@xmath2-based bh masses with continued evidence for a virial relation between the velocity dispersion of the gas measured with @xmath32 and the black hole mass .",
    "a notable zero - point offset remains between the unity relation of the iv civ  and h@xmath2  mass and the distribution of points shown in figure [ fig : newmassscale ] .",
    "we attributed the offset observed in figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] largely to prescriptional differences in the line width measurements between our study and that of vp06 .",
    "however , we use a prescription for fitting the spectra and measuring the line widths that is very similar to p13 .",
    "we have confirmed that this is not the source of the offset here by comparing the line width measurements from data we have in common with p13 ( e.g. , individual cos spectra of the rm sample ) .",
    "instead , we traced the source of the offset to the luminosity measurements .",
    "for the rm sample shared by both studies , we find that the mass offset between the p13 iv civ  masses and our own can be explained by ( 1 ) a minimal number of outliers resulting from large luminosity differences because of the distance to these objects ( ngc4151 , ngc4593 , ngc4051 , and ngc3873 ) adopted here and by p13 : p13 used the published redshifts to determine the luminosity , while we used the best estimate of the distance measured from direct measurement methods ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) , ( 2 ) small , but significant differences between l1350 and l1450 in another small subset of targets with a relatively steeper uv continuum slope ( despite direct comparisons and a statement of general equivalence by both vp06 and p13 ) , and ( 3 ) intrinsic variability , which introduces luminosity differences for individual objects because of the different method p13 used to combine multiple se spectra of a single object compared to the procedure we used here . in all but one case ( ngc4051 ) , the former two contributors lead to our iv civ  masses being lower than those estimated by p13 .",
    "the fact that the final contributor led to overall systematically lower iv civ  masses is serendipitous . in any case , the resulting zero - point offsets in our masses , while not impacting our main results here , underscores the importance for making direct measurements of the iv civ - emitting radius of the blr with reverberation mapping , so that iv civ  masses can be calibrated directly from a iv civ  @xmath29 relationship .",
    "such a calibration would be independent of the intrinsic variability effects in the current calibration that are also the hardest of the above contributors to mitigate .",
    "we have presented lbt / mods1 spectra of the iv civ  emission line of six high - redshift quasars that previously only had sdss spectra .",
    "we expanded this small sample with 41 additional homogeneously re - analyzed , high @xmath1 ( @xmath4610 pixel@xmath20 in the continuum ) spectra of the iv civemission - line region from the literature or public archives .",
    "the most significant improvements afforded by the increased data quality in the mods1 spectra over that of survey - quality data is the increased ability to accurately define the intrinsic iv civ  emission - line profile and underlying continuum and accurately identify the prevalence , location , and strength of absorption . with the advantage the data quality lends to accurately characterizing the iv civ  line profile , se iv civ  bh masses",
    "can _ reliably _ be estimated from the virial relation using high - quality data  but only when using the line dispersion , @xmath32 , to characterize the iv civ  emission - line width ( figure [ fig : masscomparefullsample ] ) .",
    "the converse is true as well : se iv civ  masses can be reliably estimated with @xmath32 , _ but only _ using high @xmath1 spectra ( figure [ fig : n07samplemasscompare ] ) .",
    "the scatter , quantified as the standard deviation about the mean of the residuals between the h@xmath2  and @xmath32-based iv civ  masses , decreased by a factor of 2 ( to 0.24dex ) between results based on survey - quality sdss spectra and high @xmath1 mods1 spectra for an , albeit , small sample of agns .",
    "similarly , however , the same measure of scatter in our full sample of 47 objects with high quality spectra was only 0.29dex .",
    "conversely , data quality had little impact on the scatter between h@xmath2  and fwhm - based iv civ  masses for our sample .",
    "this implies that obtaining high @xmath1 data can not improve fwhm - based iv civmasses the same way it can improve @xmath32-based iv civ  masses .",
    "instead , it is possible that much of the scatter between fwhm - based iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses is due to the presence of the non - variable iv civ  emission component described by @xcite .",
    "this component significantly biases the blr velocity measurement when the fwhm is used .",
    "iv civ  masses based on the fwhm of the line profile and a virial mass estimation should therefore _ not be used_.    an alternative is to apply empirical corrections to survey quality , fwhm - based mass estimates . @xcite provide an empirical correction for fwhm - based iv civ  masses based on the `` shape '' of the iv civ  line .",
    "@xcite parameterized the line shape as the ratio of the fwhm to @xmath32 and found it to correlate with the iv civ - to - h@xmath2  mass residuals .",
    "however , since characterizing the line shape this way requires a measurement of @xmath32 anyway , one could simply employ a @xmath32-based iv civ  mass and avoid the need for a correction altogether .",
    "measuring the shape from the kurtosis of the line also produces a similar correlation with the iv civ - to - h@xmath2  mass residuals , but regardless , accurately characterizing the line shape with any parameterization is data - quality dependent , so this type of correction is not likely to be as effective for survey quality data .",
    "alternately , the new empirically calibrated fwhm - based iv civ  mass scaling relationship of p13 relaxes the virial assumption between the fwhm and the bh mass in order to mitigate biases in the bh mass due to the iv civ  fwhm measurement .",
    "this reduces scatter between the iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses but removes much of the connection to the physical assumptions behind virial bh mass estimators and will still have some dependence on data quality  both the current and p13 data sets were high @xmath1 , but @xcite describes reasonable expectations for the effects the reduced @xmath1 of survey data may have on the dispersion in the mass distribution .",
    "future work is planned to improve the effectiveness of corrections for survey - quality fwhm - based masses ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as with any correction of this type , the potential for sample bias in the calibration is an issue , but such a correction has the potential to improve iv civ  masses estimated from survey - quality data at least somewhat .",
    "a11 also provide a correction to iv civ  se masses based on the ratio of uv - to - optical luminosities .",
    "argue that such a correlation is not broadly applicable because the rest frame optical luminosity is rarely available for high-@xmath17 quasar samples .",
    "nonetheless , it is the implication behind the a11 correction that is of the most interest for the iv civ - based mass debate  uv - to - optical luminosity differences may be as much of a source of scatter in the comparison of iv civ - to - h@xmath2  bh masses as the measurement of @xmath47 , implying that it is not specifically ( or only ) the iv civ  emission line that is to blame for the observed discrepancies .    in the end , reliably determining iv civ  bh masses is of significant interest to the larger astronomical community , since these masses are essential for studying the cosmic evolution and growth of bhs and their connection to galaxy evolution ( e.g. , feedback ) .",
    "even modest improvements in precision and accuracy of bh mass estimates are a step in the right direction and can add at least some additional constraints to theoretical and model- or simulation - based studies of cosmological evolution that depend on bh mass and growth rates . compared to all other literature studies of this size and type , the relatively smaller scatter observed here for the @xmath32-based se iv civ  masses , 0.28 dex , by using only high quality data implies that the best - achievable precision in se mass estimates is higher than previously believed .",
    "in particular , we fit the distribution of @xmath32-based iv civ  masses shown in figure [ fig : newmassscale ] with the idl program mpfitexy to estimate the intrinsic scatter of the iv civ  masses compared to the h@xmath2  masses , by taking into account the measurement and mass scale calibration uncertainties . by holding the slope fixed to a unity relation between the iv civ  and h@xmath2  mass",
    ", we find an estimate of the intrinsic scatter of these high quality @xmath32-based iv civ  masses to be 0.22 dex ; that for the fwhm - based iv civ  masses is similar , 0.21 dex .",
    "this is on order the observed scatter in the @xmath29 relationship on which the foundation of se mass estimates is built ( see * ? ? ?",
    "future work is planned to investigate additional applications of these results to better understand the remaining scatter between iv civ  and h@xmath2  masses .",
    "the potential for further reduction in the observed scatter between these two quantities is promising , but we may be close to the limit of what is possible for this method unless scatter in the @xmath29 relationship can be further reduced .",
    "nonetheless , the application of such results to studies of agn physics and galaxy evolution will require larger samples of high quality quasar spectra or development of new techniques that can reliably characterize the blr velocity from current survey quality spectra .",
    "we would like to thank matthias dietrich for providing iv civ  spectra for the objects from the d09 sample presented here .",
