    "[ fragile ] ) as a function of the measured glass transition temperature t@xmath7(@xmath3 ) for the present as - se , together with previous results on ge - se @xcite .",
    "it is found that when off - stoichiometric melts are followed in detail as a function of composition , one recoveres the scalings laws ( [ cor1])-([cor2 ] ) for only selected compositions corresponding merely to the stressed rigid and intermediate phase , i.e. one has a linear increase in @xmath5(@xmath11)for @xmath6122% in ge - se @xcite , and for @xmath6127% in as - se .",
    "a least - square fit to such compositions yields to @xmath5=-7.53(5)+0.061(7)@xmath11 and to @xmath5=-17.356 + 0.060(1)@xmath11 for as - se and ge - se , respectively .",
    "the slope of both curves ( @xmath25 0.06 ) is found to be somewhat lower than the one obtained @xcite for metallic glass - formers ( 0.17 ) , polymers ( 0.28 ) and hydrogen bonded liquids ( 0.25 ) .",
    "however , as noted earlier@xcite , no correlation is found among the various network formers such as b@xmath21o@xmath22@xcite , geo@xmath21@xcite or as@xmath21s@xmath22@xcite .",
    "interestingly , a negative correlation is recovered , as for the case of ge - se@xcite , which obviously can not be accounted from the vft equation given that it would lead to unphysical behaviors such as the divergence of relaxation at a temperature @xmath73 or an increase of relaxation time @xmath12 with temperature@xcite .",
    "an inspection of the different viscosity models shows that only the vft equation ( [ vft0 ] ) ( or ( [ vft ] ) ) can lead to a positive correlation ( [ cor1 ] ) between @xmath5 and @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , a simple arrhenius behavior yields from equ .",
    "( [ vft0 ] ) @xmath5=@xmath74 and the myega equation ( [ myega ] ) written in its compact form @xcite : @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] leads to : @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the apparent activation energy : @xmath77\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which both decrease as @xmath11 increases .      obviously , none of the forms for viscosity ( equs .",

    "[ scaling ] . rather than imagining an alternative form for @xmath10(t ) able to display both positive and negative correlations in @xmath5(t@xmath7 ) , we derive the conditions that should apply at the glass transition on the apparent activation energy @xmath78(@xmath54 ) involved in a function describing viscosity ( or relaxation or diffusion ) with temperature : @xmath79 for which the fragility index is given by : @xmath80_{t = t_g}={\\frac { e(t_g)}{t_g}}-e^{'}(t_g)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] out of which we can calculate the slope : @xmath81 one must thus have for flexible glasses the conditions : @xmath82 and : @xmath83 it is easy to check that either equs .",
    "( [ vft0 ] ) or ( [ myega0 ] ) only partially fulfill the differential inequalities so that they can not be used for the full trend in @xmath5(@xmath11 ) seen in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .      on a more general ground",
    ", it is seen that in order to find such negative correlations in @xmath5(t@xmath7 ) , one must either have an extremum in @xmath5 or in @xmath11 , the former situation being found in the present chalcogenides whereas the latter is encountered for e.g. , lithium borate glasses ( fig .",
    "[ scaling ] ) which show a steady increase of @xmath5 with alkali concentration@xcite but a maximum in @xmath11 .",
    "both situations will lead to a branch with a negative slope in a ( @xmath5 , @xmath11 ) plot .",
    "such a situation is not met in other glass - forming liquids where the positive correlation for @xmath5(t@xmath7 ) holds . by varying the molecular weight and cross - linking density in polymers , several authors@xcite",
    "have , indeed , demonstrated that such changes affect @xmath5 and t@xmath7 in a similar fashion , and an increase in both the fragility and t@xmath7 as a function of e.g. the cross - link density .",
    "the physics which drives the trends in @xmath5(t@xmath7 ) actually results from two independent evolutions @xmath5(@xmath3 ) and t@xmath7(@xmath3 ) with composition , yet related to the underlying structural changes .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath11 is an accurate measure of network connectivity@xcite and follows very precisely any coordination change induced by chemical alloying .",
    "this is not only true for chalcogenides but also for binary oxides such as alkali germanate or borate glasses for which a maximum in t@xmath7 is obtained when the population of some higher - coordinated species maximizes with modifier content@xcite .",
    "ultimately , it is seen that the change from a negative to a positive correlation is strongly tied to the minimum found for the fragility index @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ correl ] ) and to the reversibility window . based also on the previous findings on ge - se melts@xcite",
    ", this seems to suggest that flexible chalcogenide glasses will generally display a negative correlation given that they always exhibit an increase of t@xmath7 with connectivity but a decrease towards the fragility minimum found in the intermediate phase , whereas stressed rigid glasses will behave the opposite way .",
    "on the other hand , flexible se - rich supercooled liquids have the same structural morphology as cross - linked polymeric melts for which the vft or the wlf equations fit quite accurately the viscosity evolution , and which subsequently lead to the reported positive correlation@xcite for @xmath5(@xmath11 ) .",
    "furthermore , the glass transition temperature variation of such flexible as - se glasses can be quite accurately described@xcite from the gibbs - di marzio equation@xcite derived for cross - linked polymers .",
    "when this category of glass - forming liquids is considered , it is therefore quite unexpected that glasses with a chain - like structure do not follow the positive correlation .",
    "melt homogenization is a critical subject that is , unfortunately , often overlooked in the literature . in this article",
    ", we have shown that for off - stoichiometric compositions important physical properties crucially depend on the melt processing , and the way melts homogenize at the reaction temperature . for the present case of as - se liquids , it is found that while compositional trends ( i.e. the relative variation ) in fragility index @xmath5 do not differ with samples having been homogenized over smaller reaction times@xcite , the absolute magnitude of @xmath5 is substantially altered with differences up to about a factor two . carefully homogenized systems over long periods",
    "then lead to melts having one of the lowest known fragilities ( @xmath62 16.4 for the 24% as glass ) , lower than the archetypal strong - glass former silica .",
    "this allows understanding the origin of the slow homogenization dynamics which arises from the nature of these _ super - strong melts _ in the range of 25 - 35% as , having potentially large viscosities , and prevents from fast mixing .",
    "raman profiling confirms the overall tendencies and clearly shows that an important spread in composition still exists along the melt column after 3 days alloying ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , a time interval that already exceeds what has been routinely used in earlier studies .",
    "these results appear to be generic , and parallel to recent findings on another important chalcogenide system , ge - se@xcite .",
    "having obtained glasses and melts of proven homogeneity , we then investigate the effect of as composition on melt fragility .",
    "the obtained fragility minimum appears to be directly related to flexible to stressed rigid transitions , and to the reversibility window revealed by the nearly vanishing of the non - reversing heat flow @xmath8h@xmath84 .",
    "it is also found that homogenization impacts glass network packing such as molar volumes which display a minimum for the same compositions , a feature that originates from the stress - free nature of the network backbone . in this respect ,",
    "the present as - se reproduces all the well - established features of isostatic windows such as space - filling tendencies@xcite , thermally - reversing character of the glass transition@xcite , and fragility anomalies@xcite .",
    "given the reported impact of glass sample make up@xcite on physical properties of network glasses , the crucial role played by melt homogenization and glass processing should once again be emphasized at the end .",
    "based on the present work , and on the previous example of ge - se@xcite , we are convinced that glasses of proven homogeneity will certainly exhibit the intrinsic behavior of adaptative networks undergoing a flexible to rigid transtion over a finite width of stress - free compositions .",
