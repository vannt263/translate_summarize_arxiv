    "qed is considered as the most advanced physical theory , many of its predictions have been proven experimentally with highest available precision .",
    "nevertheless , some questions are discussed till now , e.g. , the vacuum pair creation effect by a classical electric field @xcite . a complete theoretical description of this effect has been obtained @xcite , but there is still no experimental proof . the main problem is the high value of the critical electric field strength , necessary to be reached for the pair creation , namely @xmath10 for electron - positron pairs . according to the schwinger formula ,",
    "the pair creation rate in a constant electric field is @xmath11 and therefore exponentially suppressed when @xmath12 .",
    "fortunately , the situation changes qualitatively if the field acts a finite time only @xcite . in this case , the schwinger formula as well as its analog for a monochromatic field ( brezin - itzykson formula @xcite ) become inapplicable .",
    "there are a few examples for physical situations where the schwinger effect can be observed , e.g. relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite , neutron stars @xcite and focussed laser pulses @xcite .",
    "the structure of a real laser field is too complicated for the analysis , because the schwinger effect is non - perturbative and it requires the exact solution of the dynamical equations .",
    "that is why the approximation of the homogeneous electric field is used in most cases .",
    "according to different estimates @xcite the effect of vacuum creation can not be observed with the presently achieved level of laser power , see also @xcite .",
    "the recent development of laser technology , in particular the invention of the chirped pulse amplification method , has resulted in a huge increase of the light intensity in a laser focal spot @xcite .",
    "the most advanced lasers produce pulses with intensities reaching @xmath13 w / cm@xmath8 and the pulse duration decreasing down to few oscillation periods . as the construction of x - ray free electron lasers xfels @xcite",
    "is now planned , the possibility of the experimental proof of the schwinger effect attracts attention again .",
    "the non - stationary effects become important under conditions of short pulses .",
    "we use in our work the kinetic equation approach , which allows us to consider the dynamics of the creation process taking into account the initial conditions @xcite . compared to the other treatments",
    ", the approach within the framework of a transport equation contains some new dynamical aspects , such as longitudinal momentum dependence of the distribution functions and non - markovian character of the time evolution .",
    "it takes into account the effects of the field switching and statistics , as well @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied already to the periodical field case @xcite with near - critical values of the field strength and x - ray frequencies . in particular",
    ", it was shown that there is an `` accumulation '' effect when the intensity of the field is about half critical : the average density of pairs grows steadily with the increase of the field period numbers . in the present work ,",
    "we consider the other region of field parameters really achievable nowadays in the optical lasers : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the laser field frequency .",
    "we suggest to use in the criterion for the creation efficiency the mean value @xmath1 for the density per period in the volume @xmath2 is a more appropriate characteristic quantity than the residual density @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is taken over an integer number of field periods and calculated using the imaginary time method .",
    "the main result is that optical lasers can generate a greater density @xmath1 than x - ray ones .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the statement of the problem and the necessary information about the kinetic equation which is used for the description of vacuum pair creation .",
    "we solve this equation numerically for the conditions of the slac experiment @xcite and study some features of pair production dynamics .",
    "we compare here our results obtained on the non - perturbative basis with the predictions of another approach @xcite and show that optical lasers can be effective generators of electron - positron pairs during the action of a laser pulse . in section 3 , the low density approximation is considered .",
    "it allows to get some analytical results and to make simple estimates . finally , in section 4",
    ", we discuss some possibilities of direct experimental verification of pair production by high power optical lasers .",
    "in the kinetic approach @xcite , the basic quantity is the distribution function of electrons in the momentum representation @xmath18 .",
    "the kinetic equation for this function is derived from the dirac equation in an external time - dependent field by the canonical bogoliubov transformation method @xcite , or by the help of the oscillator representation @xcite .",
    "this procedure is exact but valid only for the simplest field configurations , e.g. , the homogeneous time dependent electric field with the fixed direction @xmath19 where the vector potential is given in the hamiltonian gauge @xmath20 and the overdot denotes the time derivative .",
    "such a field is not appropriate for a quantitative description of the laser pulse , but can probably be used as qualitative model to estimate results .",
    "the corresponding kinetic equation in the collisionless limit has the form @xcite @xmath21\\cos { \\theta({\\mathbf{p}},t',t)},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ^ 2},\\\\ \\theta({\\mathbf{p}},t',t)&=&2\\int\\limits_{t'}^{t}dt_1\\,\\omega({\\mathbf{p}},t_1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",

    "the system ( [ ode ] ) is integrated via the runge - kutta method with the initial conditions @xmath25 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the distribution function is defined by means of a discretization of the momentum space in a 2-dimensional grid , where the system ( [ ode ] ) is solved in each of its nodes .",
    "the concrete grid parameters depend on the field strength , where typical values are @xmath26 ( grid step ) and @xmath27 ( grid boundary ) .",

    "this relation can be treated as the condition for quasi - classical charge transport in an external field on the time scale @xmath46 , if only the pairs are created with vanishing momenta .",

    "this is not surprising because the formula ( [ brez ] ) is not applicable for field pulses of finite duration .",
    "the simplest laser field model ( [ harm ] ) predicts the existence of a dense electron - positron plasma during a laser pulse duration , which is absorbed almost completely after switching off the field .",
    "the mean density is defined by the field strength and does not depend on frequency .",
    "the plasma density reaches @xmath65 @xmath66 within the range of the really achieved fields @xmath67 v / cm .",
    "the usual recipe for an experimental proof of the schwinger effect suggests that an increase of the residual plasma density can be achieved by an increase of both the frequency and the power of the laser radiation , e.g. , via xfel facilities @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the simpler way is to try to probe the plasma with some external field in addition to the generating one .",
    "slac experiments @xcite can serve as an example of this type , where a high energy ( @xmath68 gev ) electron beam crosses the focus of the @xmath58 nm terawatt pulsed nd - glass laser and @xmath69 positrons above background have been observed .",
    "the observed positrons are interpreted as arising from a two - step process : laser photons are backscattered to gev energies by the electron beam and a collision between the high - energy photon and several laser photons produces an electron - positron pair .",
