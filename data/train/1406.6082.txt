    "observational features of the spiral galaxies such as presence of spiral arms , rotational and radial velocity patterns and the mass distribution in the disc remain without satisfying physical explanation .",
    "moreover , the radial dependence of the rotational velocity and the spiral pattern in galaxies are treated in the literature as completely unrelated subjects .    in case of the rotational velocity profile ,",
    "most of the models developed in the last years make either extensive use of the concept of dark matter @xcite or ideas coming from alternative theories to general relativity : scalar - tensor theories of gravity , non - symmetric gravitational theory or modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite .",
    "current explanations of the observational behavior of the rotational velocity which do not use dark matter concepts exploit numerical computation of the mass distribution in the galaxy discs as a function of the rotational velocity profiles taken from the observational data ( for example @xcite ) or vice - versa .",
    "in fact , such a methodology does not explain the tangential velocity behavior .",
    "it suggests only the connection between these two phenomena .",
    "explanations of the spiral arm pattern are based mostly on the density wave theory @xcite .",
    "more about the concepts of galaxy evolution developed during the last years can be found in @xcite .",
    "a disagreement arises if , for example , the lifetime of the spiral arms is considered .",
    "usually , the wave theory is based on the cool collisionless discs of stars .",
    "however , such a construction generates rather short - lived transient spiral arms @xcite .    as a result we have complex and fully independent models explaining each observational feature : the spiral structure of galaxies and the velocity patterns of galaxy disc components .    in this work",
    "we develop a toy model in which the spiral spatial pattern and the behavior of rotational velocity of spiral galaxies are a consequence of the same physical mechanism .",
    "the model explains the nearly flat circular velocity pattern and the spiral structure of the galaxy disc using a gravitomagnetic field resulting from the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation of einstein s gravity equations .",
    "in the very - low - velocity pn approximation the gravity contains a velocity - independent and a frame and a velocity - dependent force .",
    "the latter , so called gravitomagnetic force , is similar to the forces generated by the electric and magnetic fields in classical electromagnetism .",
    "the gravitomagnetic field is a feature of rotating massive objects ( @xcite ) and mass flows @xcite . working in the very - low - velocity regime of the pn approximation , einstein s equations in harmonic gauge can be recast in the maxwell - like form using variables corresponding to the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "traditionally , in the description of large mass systems such as a galaxy , in a barycentric frame , the gravitomagnetic part is neglected due to the fact that the magnitude of this component is usually associated with a rotating galaxy core only .",
    "the gravitomagnetic field generated by the rotating galaxy core is much too small to be able to govern the motion of masses in the galaxy disc ( far from the rotating object @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the angular momentum of the rotating object ) .",
    "in such a case the very - low - velocity pn correction approximately agrees with the newtonian description . as a consequence ,",
    "such a treatment requires dark matter for explanation of the rotational velocity pattern .    in our approach",
    "we postulate that a description of a spiral galaxy requires    * an open system , e.g. we allow for income and outcome of collisional masses from the galaxy environment , * an influence of the gravitomagnetic field created by the inward and outward streams of the mass flow on the kinematics of the galaxy system .",
    "the latter point is a consequence of a fact that a spacetime geometry is modified and determined by the mass - energy and the mass - energy currents relative to other mass . in other words , it means that the gravitoelectromagnetic forces can not be eliminated by the lorentz transformations .",
    "therefore , with a given mass flow entering the galaxy system we can associate the gravitomagnetic vector potential @xmath2 and a mass current @xmath3 .",
    "both the variables can be treated as new dynamical variables suitable for description of the dynamics of the galaxy matter . using this generalization , the metric coefficients @xmath4 in harmonic gauge and in the si unit system for a particle in the barycentric frame of the galaxy system far from the center , we write as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a scalar gravitoelectric potential and @xmath7 is a vector gravitomagnetic potential .",
    "we can describe the scalar potential as a sum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a gravitational potential of the galaxy center and @xmath10 the gravitational potential seen by the incoming / outcoming mass created by the mass in the galaxy disc .",
    "the vector potential @xmath2 is determined by the amount of masses and their velocities inside the galaxy and acts back on a mass current @xmath3 .",
    "later on , instead of the vector potential @xmath2 we will use the gravitomagnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "the maxwell - like equations used for the mass streams in the galaxy disc allow taking into account the dependence between the mass currents @xmath3 and the field @xmath11 ( the vector potential @xmath2 ) .",
    "in our description we propose that the spiral form is a result of a flow of collisional masses between the galaxy environment and the galaxy center .",
    "in such a frame the gravitomagnetic field can be amplified by the mass stream affecting the rotational component of the velocity and the spiral shape of the stream .",
    "the shape of streaming masses can be obtained by the ratio of the tangential and the radial mass currents .",
    "the tangential component is created by the gravitomagnetic field and the radial part by the law of mass conservation ( the continuity equation ) .",
    "we now address the question : how can such a potentially large gravitomagnetic field be created in the spiral galaxy system ? in our model , we have two mechanisms leading to the amplification of the gravitomagnetic field :    1",
    ".   the gravitoelectromagnetic maxwell - like equations may lead to the divergence of the gravitomagnetic field created by the collisional masses entering the galaxy .",
    "2 .   the streaming motion of masses .",
    "this process is based on the interaction of the existing gravitomagnetic field with the field of the mass flow .",
    "the both mechanisms exist on the level of the maxwell - like equations .    in the first case",
    ", the gravitomagnetic field is characterised by the negative gravitomagnetic diffusivity which implies that the gravitomagnetic field will increase instead of being damped . during the evolution in time",
    "the gravitomagnetic field generated in the galaxy system , powered by an external mass may reach large values over a large space scale before its further growth is halted by the violation of the linearisation conditions of the post - newtonian approximation of the general relativity theory .    in the second mechanism",
    ", the growth of the gravitomagnetic field can be described as an interaction of the self - gravitomagnetic field generated by the moving mass carriers with the seed gravitomagnetic field ( for example , due to rotation of center of the galaxy ) .",
    "it can lead to creation of a net field acting back on the mass carriers in the galaxy disc plane .",
    "assuming that the gravitomagnetic field of the galaxy core is initially oriented along an axis perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy disc , the resulting gravitomagnetic field will follow the same orientation . as a result ,",
    "after long enough time , the mass movement inside the galaxy disc is governed by the central gravitational potential of the galaxy core and the vector gravitomagnetic potential corresponding to the net gravitomagnetic field in the galaxy disc plane . due to the orientation of the gravitomagnetic vector potential along the @xmath12 direction in cylindrical coordinates , the central gravitational field does not disturb dynamical effects induced by the vector potential .",
    "in such a geometrical configuration the canonical angular momentum of the mass in the galaxy disc , proportional to the vector gravitomagnetic potential , becomes a constant of motion and reflects the behaviour of the net gravitomagnetic vector potential .",
    "we show that such a model can describe well the rotational velocity pattern and the optical arms of spiral galaxies .",
    "this is demonstrated by performing quantitative fits of our results to the rotational velocity profiles and to the shape of the optical spiral arms of galaxies : ic0342 and ngc 4321 ( m 100 ) .",
    "both fits are satisfactory and show that the proposed model can explain the basic physical mechanism responsible for the creation and behaviour of spiral galaxies without the need of exotic phenomena .",
    "for the measured average velocity of masses in galaxies in the range @xmath13 , the ratio @xmath14 is small enough to work within the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximation .",
    "let us consider a galaxy model , consisting of a system of a rotating black hole in the center and mass carriers moving around the center in a two - dimensional disc geometry .",
    "the disc has a constant thickness denoted by @xmath15 . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will ignore gravitational and radiative effects linked to the gravitational interaction of stars with their neighbors and with the interstellar gas .",
    "also all relativistic effects are neglected .",
    "masses around the center of the system we will consider as a 2-component mass gas : collisional ( which is formed from molecules and atoms ) and collisionless ( which contains heavy elements : stars ) . by density of particles in the disc we consider the surface density ( @xmath16 ) related to the three - dimensional particle density ( @xmath17 ) and the thickness of the disc ( @xmath15 ) as @xmath18 we use the si unit system .",
    "in our model we postulate that the gravitoelectromagnetic fields can be dynamically modified by the mass currents generated in the galaxy system .",
    "therefore , working with galactic ( barycentric ) coordinates @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the gravitoelectromagnetic fields become unknown functions which should be solved . following the formulation introduced in @xcite and using @xmath21 and @xmath11 as symbols for the new dynamical fields , we can write the maxwell - like equations as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the speed of light , @xmath24 the gravitational constant , @xmath25 is the mass of collisional particle and the @xmath3 is the surface mass current expressed in the very - low - velocity approximation as    @xmath26    with @xmath27 being a velocity of the mass current .",
    "both gravitoelectromagnetic fields can be expressed through the gravitational potentials : the newtonian scalar potential @xmath10 and the gravitomagnetic vector potential @xmath2    @xmath28    in addition to the maxwell - like equations in the 1pn ( [ gravmaxwell1a]-[gravmaxwell1d ] ) the geodesic equation for the test mass particle with velocity @xmath29 in the very - low - velocity approximation can be rewritten in the form of the lorentz - force like form    @xmath30    in the model , the stellar system is considered as an open system with a central part ( core ) having a massive black hole , an outer region ( cylindrical disc ) and an external gaseous ( hydrogen ) reservoir .",
    "the regions are distinguished on the basis of the mass motion inside them .    *",
    "the central part , the core , is created by a very massive object ( for example a black hole ) and a dense gas of mass carriers .",
    "the gravitational field created by the very massive black hole dominates the motion of masses in its direct neighborhood , and is strongly influenced by complex n - body dynamics , which can not be approximated by our simplified two - dimensional analysis .",
    "let us denote the radius of the core by @xmath31 and assume that the black hole in the core rotates .",
    "the rotating mass @xmath32 with angular momentum @xmath33 generates the gravitomagnetic field @xmath34 at the point @xmath35 far from the center ( @xmath36 ) where @xmath37 . for simplicity we will use the gravitomagnetic field at the equatorial plane , where @xmath34 has only a non - zero @xmath38-component .",
    "@xmath39 * the outer part of the stellar system model is defined as a disc with an external ( @xmath40 ) and internal ( @xmath31 ) radii and is an area where the n - body gravitational interaction can be neglected and the movement of the mass carriers can be affected by the @xmath12-component of the gravitomagnetic vector potential created by the field @xmath11 aligned along the assumed @xmath38-axis determined by the angular momentum of the rotating core of the galaxy .",
    "this area can be fuelled or emptied by a flow of collisional masses to or from the external gas reservoir .",
    "the disc is considered as a two - dimensional object with constant thickness @xmath15 much smaller then the external radii ( @xmath41 ) filled with a two - component gas of mass carriers : collisional and non - collisional . * * non - collisional gas : large masses like stars for which the time between collisions is comparable or longer then the lifetime of the universe . *",
    "* collisional gas : molecules and particles having masses of the order of the hydrogen atom and the time between collisions is small in comparison with the age of the universe .    the outer part of the galaxy system as defined above is the subject of our analysis .",
    "the axial symmetry introduced by the gravitomagnetic field breaks the spherical symmetry of the central gravity field and results in the creation of the current density @xmath42 in the plane perpendicular to the gravitomagnetic field . for simplicity of our calculations",
    "we neglect any movement along the @xmath38-axis , limit our analysis only to the plane @xmath43 in the cylindrical coordinate system and replace the @xmath38 derivative by the disc thickness .    in this area , i.e. far from the galaxy center where the velocities of the colliding masses are non - relativistic , in addition to the set of eqs ( [ gravmaxwell1 ] ) we introduce in this region the gravitational analog of ohm s law for the collisional gas    @xmath44    using notation characteristic for electromagnetic phenomena , @xmath45 corresponds to the electromagnetic conductivity and @xmath46 to the mass mobility .",

    "taking into account our assumption that the motion of the mass carriers is governed only by the central part of the galaxy system ( the potential @xmath9 ) , so that it does not depend on the gravitational interactions with neighbors , we can write @xmath61 . as a proof of this",

    "each collision modifies not only the momentum but the effective gravitational potential as well .",
    "such a modified potential generates a further change in the state function causing the system exhibit gravitational clustering where signs of cooperative behaviour can be seen .",
    "it is clear that the assumption @xmath69 determines also the newtonian limit in our model .",

    "( [ boltzmann2 ] ) .",
    "since it represents the equilibrium state of the system , the mass current generated by such a state function is equal to @xmath70 . therefore , in the newtonian limit of this model the gravitational analog of ohm s law is :    @xmath71    in the model , the gravitoelectromagnetic components introduce correlations , gravitoelectromagnetic filamentation , into the system which leads to a nonzero displacement of the distribution function @xmath72 from its equilibrium state .",

    "detailed derivation of equation ( [ lorentz0 ] ) is presented in appendix [ appendixboltzmann ] .    for the collisionless part of the galaxy disc components ( stars ) the gravitational ohm s law is an improper approximation because of the very large relaxation time ( nearly equal to the age of the universe ) . in this case , neglecting gravitational interaction with neighbors , the heavy masses in the system have to be considered as a subsystem in the equilibrium state .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the state function , defined in eq .",
    "( [ expansion1 ] ) with correction @xmath59 given by eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann4a ] ) is no longer a valid approach .",
    "therefore the collisionless gas of masses can not create gravitoelectromagnetic fields , however due to the nonzero value of the mass , this fraction of the gas can interact with the gravitoelectromagnetic fields created by the collisional component of the galaxy system .",
    "the equation of motion for each component of the galaxy system ( collisional or non - collisional ) in the outer part of the disc is governed by the same lorentz - like formula ,    @xmath76    where the mass @xmath25 and the velocity @xmath27 can be associated with a colliding particle or a star .",
    "the gravitoelectromagnetic parts @xmath21 and @xmath11 are the fields created by the collisional component of the galaxy disc described by the gravitational ohm s law ( [ lorentz0 ] ) .",
    "let us stress the difference between the ohm - like law ( [ lorentz0 ] ) and its electromagnetic analog . due to the fact that the mass @xmath25 plays the role of the charge , the conductivity in the system is proportional to the mass , while the term proportional to the gravitomagnetic field is mass independent . as a consequence of this",
    "all participating masses show the same dynamics due to the gravitomagnetic fields .",
    "equation ( [ lorentz0 ] ) is the fundamental one for the model presented here .",
    "the creation and the initial development of the current stream described by equation ( [ lorentz0 ] ) requires more detailed considerations . for the purpose of this work we can list two possible mechanisms for the initialisation of the gravitomagnetic field related to the mass flow :    * by the existence of the gravitomagnetic field generated by the massive rotating black hole in the center of the galaxy @xmath77 ( eq .",
    "( [ h0core ] ) , * by the gravitational n - body interaction in the galaxy bulge resulting in creation of the spatial stream pattern .",
    "the pattern remains very unstable if we consider only the gravitational multi - body interaction @xcite .",
    "when the resulting gravitomagnetic field @xmath11 is large enough , the field stands to act as a supporting mechanism for development of mass stream spatial structures .",
    "since the gravitomagnetic fields are weak , the above mechanism can be considered on small distances between the initialisation sources .",
    "the increase of the gravitomagnetic field allows to influence more distant masses .",
    "therefore , one should see an evolution of the galactic disc starting from a spatially small structure which grows with time .",
    "another important assumption introduced in the model is incompressibility of the fluid where we treat the density of masses in the developed paths of generated currents as constant . from now on , we will model a mass filament as a two - dimensional flow of an incompressible fluid and a nondissipational structure . in this limit the final form of the maxwell - like equations describing the gravitoelectromagnetic fields associated with the mass current",
    "can be simplified to :    @xmath78    it is obvious that the gravitomagnetic field generated only by the rotating core of the galaxy is too weak to drive the mass carriers in the outer part .",
    "however , additional mass flow - created spontaneously , can amplify the magnitude of the total gravitomagnetic field generated in the system . to see this",
    "let us take into account equation ( [ gravmaxwell1finald ] ) , in which the right part is proportional to the mass current . if we consider a loop of mass flow in the presence of an initial gravitomagnetic field @xmath34 the gravitomagnetic field generated by the mass movement has the same direction as the initial field @xmath34 .",
    "this increase of the resulting gravitomagnetic field @xmath11 leads to increase of the mass current . as a result",
    "the system becomes diverging and in the limit violates the linearisation conditions .",
    "working within the non - relativistic and post - newtonian approximations and using eqs ( [ gravmaxwell1b ] ) , ( [ gravmaxwell1d ] ) and ( [ lorentz0 ] ) we derive the equation for the gravitomagnetic field @xmath11 alone ( for details of derivation see appendix [ appendixhalone ] ) ,    @xmath79    the positive coefficient @xmath80 with the present minus sign on the right side of the equation above has the character of a negative gravitomagnetic diffusivity .",
    "the existence of the surface particle density @xmath16 and the surface relaxation time @xmath47 in the gas implies that the diffusivity coefficient @xmath80 shows a local character specific for each galaxy .",
    "the negative diffusivity amplifies small perturbations ( in our case it could be an initial gravitomagnetic field @xmath34 ) and can lead to an explosion .",
    "it is a situation in which we are not restricted by any limits .",
    "the calculations presented here are done in the frame of the very - low - velocity 1pn approximation and are valid only inside such limits .",
    "summarizing , the basic idea of the model can be presented as follows .",
    "spontaneously created surface mass current flow starts to induce a gravitomagnetic self - field which , interacting with the central gravitomagnetic field ( or with the field created by another surface mass flow ) , is magnified and leads to the gravitomagnetic net field which begins to modify the surface current .",
    "an increasing gravitomagnetic field increases the mass involved in the flow .",
    "because we assumed , that the net surface density of the current remains constant , the length of the stream has to be increased , which causes an increase of the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "the system starts to behave in a cooperative way , increasing the length of surface mass streams and grows spatially with time .    in the case of the newtonian limit ( eq .",
    "( [ lorentz01 ] ) ) , i.e. without incoming and outcoming matter from the gas reservoir , the gravitomagnetic field in the system is due solely to the rotating black hole in the galaxy core ( @xmath34 . eq .",
    "( [ h0core ] ) ) .",
    "the small value of the gravitomagnetic field @xmath77 allows us to completely ignore it for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "let us determine the radial component of the current @xmath83 . calculating the divergence from equation ( [ gravmaxwell1d ] ) and using eqs ( [ gravmaxwell1a ] ) we get the continuity equation    @xmath84    because we assumed that the mass stream acts as an incompressible fluid , the density of masses @xmath16 in the current is constant .",

    "the current @xmath89 is the external mass flow introduced into the galaxy system .",
    "using equations ( [ gravmaxwell1d ] ) we can determine directions of the current flow corresponding to the @xmath91 sign :    * @xmath92 for the inward direction , * @xmath93 for the outward direction .",

    "<S> the collisional part of the mass gas in the galaxy disc plane , i.e. molecules and atoms , is responsible for the creation of the gravitomagnetic field . according to the model </S>",
    "<S> the spiral pattern of arms is static and determined by a direction of the mass flow . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces qualitatively the observed spiral arms and reproduces well the shape of the rotational velocity pattern . as an example of the usability of the proposed mechanism , we reproduce qualitatively the above features for the ic 342 and ngc 4321 galaxies . </S>"
