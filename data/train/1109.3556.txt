    "distributed computation in network control systems has received great attention in the last years .",
    "one of the most studied problems is the _ consensus problem_. given a network of processors , the task of reaching consensus consists of computing a common desired value by performing local computation and exchanging local information .",
    "a variety of distributed algorithms for diverse system dynamics and consensus objectives has been proposed in the literature .",
    "we are interested in two problems that may arise in a network running a consensus algorithm when only a subset of nodes is controlled by an external input or measured by an external processor .",
    "namely , is it possible to reach all the node configurations just controlling a limited number of nodes ? respectively ,",
    "is it possible to reconstruct the entire network state just knowing the state of a limited number of nodes ?    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on a first - order network system running a laplacian based average consensus algorithm with fixed communication graph topology of path or cycle type .",
    "average consensus has been widely studied in the last years .",
    "several distributed feedback laws have been proposed . a survey on these algorithms and their performance",
    "may be found e.g. in @xcite and references therein . the dynamical system arising from a consensus network with fixed topology",
    "is a linear time - invariant system .",
    "the problem of understanding if all the node configurations can be reached by controlling a given subset of nodes is a reachability problem . respectively ,",
    "the problem of understanding if the entire network state may be reconstructed is an observability problem .",
    "we organize the relevant literature in two areas .",
    "first , the reachability problem in a first - order network arises in network systems where all ( or most of ) the nodes run a linear average consensus algorithm , while a subset of them can be driven by an exogenous input .",
    "these networks are often called leader - follower networks in the sense that the nodes controlled by an external input are leaders that drive the followers to desired configurations . the reachability ( controllability ) problem for a leader - follower network was introduced in @xcite for a single control node .",
    "intensive simulations were provided showing that it is `` unlikely '' for a laplacian based consensus network to be completely controllable . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "necessary conditions for controllability , based on suitable properties of the graph , have been provided .",
    "the conditions rely on algebraic graph tools based on the notion of equitable partitions of a graph .",
    "a more exhaustive analysis of the controllability and other structural system properties for network systems on the basis of graph structural properties can be found in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite preliminary results are given for the controllability of first - order network with switching communication topology applied to the formation control problem .",
    "in @xcite sufficient conditions for controllability in first and second order multi - agent systems with delay are given .",
    "the conditions are based on the eigenstructure of the network system and delay matrices . in @xcite",
    "necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the controllability of tree graphs are given , based on the eigenvalues of suitable subgraphs .",
    "a first contribution to the controllability of multi - agent systems with nonlinear dynamics is provided in @xcite , where the controllability of pairs of identical nonholonomic vehicles maintaining a constant distance is studied .",
    "second , observability for a network system running an average consensus algorithm has been studied for the first time in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the authors provide necessary conditions for observability .",
    "the conditions are based on equitable partitions of a graph as in the reachability setting investigated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a recent reference on observability for network dynamic systems is @xcite . here ,",
    "the linear dynamical systems of the network are decoupled and the coupling among the systems appears through the output .",
    "a parallel research line investigates a slightly different property called _ structural observability _ @xcite . here",
    ", the objective is to choose the nonzero entries of the consensus matrix ( i.e. the state matrix of the resulting network system ) in order to obtain observability from a given set of nodes .",
    "however , in many contexts the structure of the system matrix is given ( e.g. the laplacian for average consensus ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , the observability property is an important property in distributed estimation , @xcite , and intrusion detection problems @xcite for steady state analysis . in the literature",
    "this property is often assumed or considered as non generic .",
    "finally , preliminary results on the controllability and observability of path and cycle graphs were given in @xcite , where , using these properties , a formation control strategy was proposed .",
    "the contribution of the paper is twofold .",
    "first , we provide _ necessary and sufficient _ conditions based on simple algebraic relations from number theory that completely characterize the reachability ( observability ) of path and cycle graphs .",
    "more in detail , on the basis of the node labels and the total number of nodes in the graph we are able to : ( i ) identify all and only the reachable ( observable ) nodes of the graph , ( ii ) say if the graph is reachable ( observable ) from a given set of nodes and ( iii ) construct a set of control ( observation ) nodes from which the graph is reachable ( observable ) .",
    "interesting immediate corollaries of our results are : ( i ) a path graph is reachable ( observable ) from any single node if and only if the number of nodes of the graph is a power of two , @xmath0 , ( ii ) a path graph is reachable ( observable ) from a single node @xmath2 if and only if there is no odd prime factor @xmath3 of @xmath1 such that @xmath4 for some integer @xmath5 ; ( iii ) a cycle graph is reachable ( observable ) from any pair of nodes if and only if @xmath1 is a prime number , and ( iv ) a cycle graph is reachable ( observable ) from two nodes , say @xmath6 and @xmath7 , if and only if @xmath8 and @xmath9 are coprime .",
    "thus , e.g. , any cycle is observable from two adjacent nodes .",
    "second , we provide a closed form expression for the unreachable ( unobservable ) eigenvalues and eigenvectors , and characterize the orthogonal complement to the reachable subspace ( respectively the unobservable subspace ) for any unreachable ( unobservable ) set of nodes .",
    "this result is based on the complete characterization of the spectrum of suitable submatrices of the path and cycle laplacians . as a consequence of these linear algebra results",
    ", we also provide a closed form for all the laplacian eigevalues of a path graph . at the best of our knowledge both",
    "the characterization of the laplacian eigenvalues and the mathematical tools used to characterize them are new .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : prelims ] we introduce some preliminary definitions and properties of undirected graphs , describe the network model used in the paper and set up the reachability and observability problems . in section  [ sec : cycle - path_spectrum ] we provide a complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian of a path graph and other matrices used to study the path and cycle reachability ( observability ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : main_results ] we provide a complete characterization of the path and cycle graph reachability ( observability ) , and provide some useful example explaining the main results .",

    "the _ greatest common divisor _ of two positive integers @xmath46 and @xmath41 is the largest divisor common to @xmath46 and @xmath41 , and we will denote it @xmath47 . the greatest common divisor can also be defined for three or more positive integers as the largest divisor shared by all of them .",
    "two or more positive integers that have greatest common divisor @xmath48 are said _ relatively prime _ or _",

    "notice that in our factorization we allow two or more factors @xmath52 to be equal .",
    "in this section we present some preliminary terminology on graph theory , introduce the network model , set up the reachability and observability problems , and provide some standard results on reachability ( observability ) of linear systems that will be useful to prove the main results of the paper .",

    "we introduce the two undirected graphs that will be of interest in the rest of the paper , namely the path and cycle graphs . a _ path graph _",
    "is a graph in which there are only nodes of degree two except for two nodes of degree one .",
    "the nodes of degree one are called external nodes , while the other are called internal nodes . from now on , without loss of generality , we will label the external nodes with @xmath48 and @xmath1 , and the internal nodes so that the edge set is @xmath69 .",
    "cycle graph _ is a graph in which all the nodes have degree two .",
    "from now on , without loss of generality , we will label the nodes so that the edge set is @xmath70 .",
    "we consider a collection of agents labeled by a set of identifiers @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of agents .",
    "we assume that the agents communicate according to a _ time - invariant undirected _ communication graph @xmath53 , where @xmath73 .",
    "that is , we assume that the communication between any two agents is bi - directional . the agents run a consensus algorithm based on a laplacian control law ( see e.g. @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "the dynamics of the agents evolve in continuous time ( @xmath74 ) and are given by @xmath75 using a compact notation the dynamics may be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77^t = [ x_1 \\ldots x_n]^t$ ] is the vector of the agents states and @xmath65 is the graph laplacian .    in discrete time , we can consider the following dynamics @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a given parameter .",
    "a compact expression for the dynamics is @xmath80 for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the maximum degree of the graph ) , @xmath83=@xmath84 is a nonnegative , doubly stochastic , stable matrix .",
    "it can be easily shown that the continuous and discrete time systems have the same reachability and observability properties ( namely the same unreachable and unobservable eigenvalues and eigenvectors ) .",
    "therefore , the results shown in the paper also hold in this discrete time set - up .      in this section",
    "we describe the mathematical framework that we will use to study the reachability and observability of a network system .",
    "we start by describing the scenarios that motivate our work .",
    "as regards the reachability problem , we imagine that in a network of agents running average consensus as in section  [ sec : network_model ] , a subset of nodes can be controlled by an external input . in the literature these nodes are often called _ leader nodes _ or _ pinned nodes_. the idea is that they are special nodes with higher computation capabilities so that more sophisticated control laws can be designed .",

    "as regards the observability problem , we imagine that an external processor ( _ not _ running the consensus algorithm ) collects information from some nodes in the network .",
    "we call these nodes _ observation nodes_. in particular , we assume that the external processor may read the state of each observation node .",
    "equivalently , we can think of one or more observation nodes , running the consensus algorithm , that have to reconstruct the state of the network by processing only their own state . we can model these two scenarios with the following mathematical framework . for each observation",
    "node @xmath89 , we have the following output @xmath90 given the set of observation nodes @xmath91 , the output is @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the system dynamics is given by @xmath93 where the output matrix is @xmath94^t$ ] .",
    "it is a well known result in linear systems theory that the reachability properties of the pair @xmath95 are the same as the observability properties of the pair @xmath96 .    due to the symmetry of the state matrix @xmath65 , the network is reachable from a given subset of nodes if and only if it is observable from it .",
    "this important property allows , for example , to design a regulator at a subset of ( control / observation ) nodes that estimates the entire network state and controls it to a desired configuration .",
    "this has , for example , certainly an impact on security issues .",
    "straightforward results from linear system theory can be used to prove that the controllability problem studied , e.g. , in @xcite and @xcite and the dual observability problem studied in @xcite can be equivalently formulated in our set up .",
    "the reachability problem consists of looking for those states that can be reached in finite time from the origin . respectively , the observability problem consists of looking for nonzero values of @xmath97 that produce an identically zero output @xmath98 . using known results in linear system theory the two problems are equivalent to studying the rank of the reachability matrix , @xmath99,\\ ] ] respectively of the observability matrix @xmath100 the image @xmath101 of @xmath102 is the _ reachable subspace _ , i.e. the set of states that are reachable from the origin .",
