    "one of the most prominent features of the classical theory of holomorphic modular forms is the _ weight _ , i.e. , the integer ( or sometimes fraction ) @xmath4 appearing in the transformation law @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a modular form and @xmath7 is an element of its discrete automorphy group .",
    "maass developed a parallel theory for non - holomorphic forms of various weights , including his well - known explicit operators which increase and lower the weight by 2 .",
    "gelfand - graev ( see @xcite ) gave a reformulation of modular and maass forms as functions on the group @xmath8 , in which ( [ weightk ] ) is interpreted representation - theoretically as an @xmath9-equivariance condition ( see ( [ so2isotypic1 ] ) ) , and maass s raising and lowering operators naturally correspond to lie algebra derivatives ( see ( [ sl2updownaction ] ) and ( [ sl2diffops3 ] ) ) .",

    "our motivation is that restriction of a @xmath3-isotypic automorphic form on @xmath0 to @xmath3 is itself a sum of wigner functions , which justifies the importance of this basis .",
    "as do the methods of @xcite , our method also allows the computation of the composition series of principal series representations of @xmath0 , as well as the action of intertwining operators on @xmath3-types .",
    "moreover , it applies ( with straightforward modifications ) to many other real reductive lie groups , in particular those whose maximal compact subgroup is isogenous to a product of @xmath1 s and tori ( such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , pursued in @xcite ) , and indeed to any group satisfying a sufficiently - explicit analog of the clebsch - gordan multiplication formula ( [ cg1 ] ) .",
