    "conventionally , wireless communication nodes operate in half duplex ( hd ) mode under which they transmit and receive signals over orthogonal frequency or time resources",
    ". recent advances , nevertheless , suggest that full duplex ( fd ) communications that allows simultaneous transmission and reception of signal over the same radio channel be possible @xcite .",
    "in addition to the immediate benefit of essentially doubling the bandwidth , full duplex communications also find applications in simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) .",
    "much interest has turned to full - duplex relaying in which information is sent from a source node to a destination node through an intermediate relaying node which is powered by means of wireless energy harvesting . in the literature , the studies on relay aided swipt largely considered hd relaying and adopted a time - switched relaying ( tsr ) approach @xcite@xcite .",
    "authors in @xcite considered swipt in miso multicasting systems , in @xcite considered swipt in miso broadcasting systems , and in @xcite miso secrecy systems , where the joint transmit beamforming and receive power splitting problem for minimising the transmit power of the base station ( bs ) subject to signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and energy harvesting constraints at the receiver was investigated .",
    "in contrast to the existing results , this paper studies the joint optimization of the two - way beamforming matrix for swipt in a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) amplify - and - forward ( af ) full - duplex relay system employing a power splitter ( ps ) , where the sum rate is maximized subject to the energy harvesting and total power constraints .    _",
    "notations_we use @xmath0 to represent a complex matrix with dimension of @xmath1 . also , we use @xmath2 to denote the conjugate transpose , while @xmath3 is the trace operation , and @xmath4 denotes the frobenius norm .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 returns the absolute value of a scalar , and @xmath6 denotes that the hermitian matrix @xmath7 is positive semidefinite .",
    "the expectation operator is denoted by @xmath8 we define @xmath9 as the orthogonal projection onto the column space of @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 as the orthogonal projection onto the orthogonal complement of the column space of @xmath12",
    "let us consider swipt in a three - node mimo relay network consisting of two sources @xmath13 and @xmath14 wanting to exchange information with the aid of an af relay @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alex ] . in our model",
    ", all the nodes are assumed to operate in fd mode , and we also assume that there is no direct link between @xmath13 and @xmath14 so communication between them must be done via @xmath15 . both @xmath13 and @xmath14 transmit their messages simultaneously to @xmath15 with transmit power @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .    in the broadcast phase ,",
    "the relay @xmath15 employs linear processing with an amplification matrix @xmath18 to process the received signal and broadcasts the processed signal to the nodes with the harvested power @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that each source node is equipped with a pair of transmitter - receiver antennas for signal transmission and reception respectively .",
    "we use m@xmath20 and m@xmath21 to denote the number of transmit and receive antennas at @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath22 and @xmath23 to , respectively , denote the directional channel vectors between the source node @xmath24 s @xmath25 transmit antenna to @xmath15 s receive antennas , and that between the relay s transmit antenna(s ) to source node @xmath24 s receive antenna .",
    "the concurrent transmission and reception of signals at the nodes produces self - interference ( si ) which inhibits the performance of a full duplex system .",
    "we consider using existing si cancellation mechanisms in the literature to mitigate the si ( e.g. , antenna isolation , analog and digital cancellation , and etc . )",
    "@xcite .    due to imperfect channel estimation ,",
    "however , the si can not be cancelled completely @xcite . we therefore denote @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 as the si channels at the corresponding nodes . for simplicity , we model the residual si ( rsi ) channel as a gaussian distribution random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath29 , for @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the relay is equipped with a ps device which splits the received signal power at the relay for energy harvesting , amplification and forwarding of the received signal .",
    "in particular , the received signal at the relay is split such that a @xmath31 portion of the received signal power at the relay is fed to the information receiver ( ir ) and the remaining @xmath32 portion of the power to the energy receiver ( er ) at the relay .",
    "when the source nodes transmit their signals to the relay , the af relay employs a short delay to perform linear processing .",
    "it is assumed that the processing delay at the relay is given by a @xmath33symbol duration , which denotes the processing time required to implement the full duplex operation @xcite .",
    "@xmath33 typically takes integer values .",
    "we assume that the delay is short enough compared to a time slot which has a large number of data symbols , and thus its effect on the achievable rate is negligible . at time",

    "the harvested energy at the relay should be above a given threshold so that a useful level of harvested energy is reached . as a result , we formulate the joint relay beamforming and receive ps ratio ( @xmath64 ) optimization problem as a maximization problem of the sum rate .",
    "mathematically , this problem is formulated as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the maximum transmit power at the relay and @xmath67 is the minimum amount of harvested energy required to maintain the relay s operation .",
    "in this section , our aim is to maximize the sum - rate of the proposed fd mimo two - way af - relaying channel .",
    "considering the fact that each source only transmits a single data stream and the network coding principle encourages mixing rather than separating the data streams from the two sources , we decompose @xmath18 as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the transmit beamforming vector and @xmath70 denotes the receive beamforming vector at the relay . then the zf condition is simplified to @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath72 because in general @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "according to the result obtained in @xcite , @xmath70 can be parameterized by @xmath80 as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a non - negative real - valued scaler .",
    "it should be made clear that ( [ alex1 ] ) is not a complete characterization of @xmath70 because it is also involved in the zf constraint @xmath83 but this parameterization makes the problem more tractable .",
    "thus , given @xmath84 we can optimize @xmath69 for fixed ps ratio @xmath64 . then perform a 1-d search to find the optimal @xmath85 .      for given @xmath70 and @xmath69 ,",
    "the optimal receive ps ratio @xmath64 can be determined .",
    "firstly , using the monotonicity between sinr and the rate , ( [ y6 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath86 problem ( [ rho1 ] ) is a linear - fractional programming problem , and can be converted into a linear programming problem @xcite .",
    "the receive ps ratio is determined by the equation set below :    @xmath87    using the procedure in @xcite , the optimal @xmath64 can be found by @xmath88 we check whether the above solution satisfies the constraint ( [ rho1 ] ) . if it does , then it is the optimal solution .",
    "otherwise the energy harvesting constraint should be met with equality thus giving the optimal receive ps ratio @xmath89 given by @xmath90      here , we first study how to optimize @xmath69 for given @xmath82 and @xmath91 then we perform a 1-d search on @xmath82 to find the optimal @xmath85 which guarantees an optimal @xmath92 as defined in ( [ alex1 ] ) for the given @xmath91 for convenience , we define a semidefinite matrix @xmath93",
