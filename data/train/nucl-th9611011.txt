    "almost completely dominate the phenomenology .",
    "these continuum model contributions are subtracted from the leading terms of the ope such that the terms independent of the borel mass dominate the ope .",
    "this effect trivially explains why in ref .",
    "@xcite a plateau was reached when the borel mass was greater than 1.8 gev . as a result ,",

    "it is interesting to observe how different sum rules resolve the same observables in different ways .",

    "[ tabga ] we give a summary of the results from the consideration of 1000 sets of qcd parameters .",

    "sum rule  ( [ mix2 ] ) consistently predicts larger values for the couplings than the rest .",
    "also the correct ordering @xmath157 is apparent .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties in the coupling constants are large at about 50% to 100% , as compared to the nucleon mass obtained from the same method , which only has 10% to 25% errors [ see eq.([fit1 ] ) and eq.([fit2 ] ) ] .",
    "the large uncertainties suggest that fine adjustments of the qcd input parameters will allow one to make the central values of the fit parameters reproduce the experimental numbers . at the present stage",
    ", we feel that such refinements are not meaningful until the sum rules themselves are derived to a similar accuracy .",
    "when the continuum threshold is included as a search parameter , the only stable results for @xmath0 are from sum rule  ( [ mix5 ] ) .",
    "this sum rule proves to be the best sum rule we derived .",

    "we have compared the quality of the fits with or without searching the continuum threshold and found they are essentially the same .",
    "the origin of the large errors lies mainly in the poorly determined normalization of the two - point function as indicated by the large uncertainty in @xmath141 .",
    "while we can consider ratios of two- and three - point functions to eliminate the parameter @xmath141 , the poorly determined normalization of the two - point function remains .",
    "the hope was that the two- and three - point functions would be sufficiently correlated that the poorly determined normalization of the two - point function would mirror that of the three - point function and allow an extraction of @xmath0 with small uncertainties . however , our analysis indicates this is not the case .    some interplay between @xmath0 and @xmath141",
    "is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ corrgar8 ] and in particular  [ corrgar13 ] .",
    "the correlations exist because the valid borel regimes for the sum rules are not identical , and the residue does not factor out as it would in a ratio of sum rules .",

    "we expect the result to be general to any qcd sum rule of nucleon current matrix elements ( three - point functions ) from the linear response of the external - field .",
    "only when the external - field is treated non - perturbatively , might the drawback be avoided  @xcite .",
    "other sources of uncertainty are in the poorly known vacuum susceptibility @xmath42 and in the factorization approximation of higher order operators . from correlation studies we discovered that the sum rules seem to favor smaller factorization violation and larger vacuum susceptibility @xmath42 .",
    "better estimates of these parameters are clearly needed .",
    "the presence of the transitions is an additional source of contamination not found in two - point functions . to see the role the transitions play ,",

    "in fact this is the method explicitly used in previous analyses to extract @xmath0 , except that some combinations with the mass sum rule or other sum rules were used .",
    "it is clear that the transitions play a crucial role since they determine the slope of the line from which @xmath0 is extracted .",

    "we see that the two sides of the sum rules do not match very well when the continuum threshold is not searched .",
    "the match improves significantly for the mixed correlator sum rules when the continuum threshold is searched .",
    "a large uncertainty was found for the searched continuum threshold in sum rule  ( [ sum3])(pc ) .",
    "this suggests that it is really unable to separate the pole from the continuum .",
    "the above results confirm that the continuum threshold in the new formalism is relied upon to compensate for the transition strength that was explicitly taken into account in the standard approach .",
    "fixing it in the new approach would introduce an artificial bias to the extracted ground state spectral properties .",
    "this is in contrast with the situation in the standard approach .",
    "there the ope was not altered and the transitions were modeled explicitly . as a result ,",
    "the quality of the fits with or without searching the continuum thresholds was essentially the same .",
    "we have derived eleven new qcd sum rules for the nucleon axial vector coupling constants using the external - field method and generalized interpolating fields .",
    "three are from the spin-1/2 correlator , which can be reduced and compared to those in the literature .",
    "eight are from the mixed correlator , which are new . using the monte - carlo analysis , we are able to determine the predicative ability of the new sum rules for @xmath0 for the first time .",
    "the main advantage of the monte - carlo analysis is that it takes into account all uncertainties in the qcd input parameters simultaneously , allowing a quantitative study of how the uncertainties in the qcd input parameters propagate to the phenomenological fit parameters .",
    "the method carefully monitors the ope convergence and the ground - state dominance , the two key criteria in order for the qcd sum rule method to work .",
    "together they determine the borel window over which the two sides of the sum rules are matched .",
    "those sum rules which do not have a valid borel window are considered unreliable and therefore discarded .",
    "conventional qcd sum rule analysis is limited to only a small portion of the qcd parameter space , and often the uncertainties assigned to the fit parameters are not based on rigorous error analysis but rather have a certain degree of arbitrariness .",
    "our most important findings in this work are : a ) the nucleon axial vector coupling constants calculated from standard qcd sum rule method have large uncertainties associated with them , approximately 50% to 100% , as compared to the nucleon mass obtained from the same method which has only 10% to 25% error . within uncertainties ,",
    "the numbers obtained from different sum rules are consistent with each other and with the experimental values at 1.5@xmath160 .",
    "the correct ordering in magnitude of the coupling constants , @xmath157 , is also predicted by the sum rules .",
    "b ) sum rule ( [ sum2 ] ) , upon which the previous analyses of @xmath0 are based , has poor ope convergence and poor ground - state dominance properties .",
    "the results extracted from this sum rule are unreliable . both of these findings contradict the conventional wisdom .",
    "traditionally , 10% to 20% errors are often claimed for @xmath0 from qcd sum rule calculations without rigorous error analysis .",
    "the selection of sum rule ( [ sum2 ] ) was based upon similarities with the mass sum rule  @xcite at the structure @xmath133 , which was shown to have poor convergence properties  @xcite , or dimension arguments  @xcite .",
    "our monte - carlo analysis has shown that such criteria may not be reliable in selecting sum rules .",
    "the origin of the large errors in @xmath0 is three - fold .",
    "first , it is in the poorly determined nucleon mass sum rules , which are used to normalize the couplings extracted from the form @xmath158 .",
    "second , two new parameters are needed to describe the response of the qcd vacuum to the external field .",
    "these new parameters introduce additional uncertainties , especially the vacuum susceptibility @xmath42 which is very poorly known .",
    "third , the transitions between the ground state and the excited states caused by the probing axial current is another source of uncertainty .",
    "their contributions are not exponentially suppressed relative to the ground state and must be included in the spectral representation .",
    "little is known about these transitions .",
    "the standard approach is to introduce a new phenomenological parameter to account for all the contributions from the transitions .",
    "usually the new parameter is assumed to be constant , but in fact it depends in some complicated way on the borel mass .",
    "the approximation may have a sizable impact on the results since it plays a crucial role in the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "in any event , the presence of an additional unknown parameter leads to larger uncertainties in @xmath0 .    to further investigate the role of the transitions ,",
    "we have studied an alternative treatment which can lead to exponential suppression of their contributions relative to the ground state . as a result",
    ", one can apply the traditional pole - plus - continuum model in the phenomenological representation .",
    "the contributions of the transitions are not lost , but simply get absorbed in the new continuum model .",
    "so it is important in this formalism to search the continuum threshold as an independent parameter .",
    "the results for the coupling constants are similar to those in the standard approach .",
    "this implies that the main source of error is not in the treatment of transitions , but in the pole residues and the vacuum susceptibilities .",
    "however , there are advantages to be gained with the new formalism .",
    "the borel windows become generally wider , and the numerical fits are generally more stable .",
    "future studies should take advantage of the method to avoid errors associated with the approximation of modeling of the unwanted transitions .",
    "as for the question of valid sum rules for @xmath0 , our monte - carlo analysis reveals that only three out of the eleven sum rules are able to resolve the ground state properties from the continuum .",
    "they are sum rule ( [ sum3 ] ) from the spin-1/2 correlator , ( [ mix2 ] ) and ( [ mix5 ] ) from the mixed correlator .",
    "even the three valid sum rules perform differently .",
    "sum rule ( [ mix5 ] ) has the best performance in terms of allowing a full search and the stability of the results .",
    "it is followed by sum rule ( [ mix2 ] ) , then by ( [ sum3 ] ) .",
    "we find that in general the mixed correlator sum rules perform better than the spin-1/2 correlator sum rules , similar to the situation for the nucleon mass sum rules .",
    "study of correlations among the input and fit parameters reveals how a particular sum rule resolves the ground state from the continuum .",
    "we find that @xmath0 does not have strong correlations with the quark condensate , the mixed condensate , the gluon condensate , nor the vacuum susceptibility @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath0 has some weak positive correlations with the factorization violation parameter @xmath155 , and some weak negative correlations with the vacuum susceptibility @xmath42 .",
    "these correlations can give some hints on what values for @xmath155 and @xmath42 are preferred by the self - consistency requirement in the sum rules .",
    "we should stress that correlation patterns are different for different sum rules .",
    "the above observations are some general trends displayed by all the valid sum rules , despite some subtle differences .    as to the problem of how to reduce the large uncertainties in @xmath0 from qcd sum rule calculations , one may attack it from several directions as suggested from the discussion of their origins : a ) improved accuracy of the qcd sum rules , b ) better estimates of the vacuum susceptibilities , especially @xmath42 , and c ) better treatment of the transitions . of these , point a )",
    "is the most important .",
    "one way to improve the accuracy of the sum rules is to reduce the uncertainties in the qcd input parameters .",
    "however , there is a limit on it . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the best one can do with current implementation of the qcd sum rule approach is 25% for the two - point function normalization .",
    "reduction of this uncertainty to the 10% level requires 5% uncertainties on the qcd input parameters .",
    "but this level of accuracy is beyond the current state of the art as indicated by the unacceptably large @xmath161 .",
    "we believe the future lies in improving the sum rules themselves .",
    "examples may include incorporating @xmath162 corrections , higher order power corrections , and devising alternative interpolating fields that result in better sum rules , as done here .",
    "finally , we want to point out that although this work is focused on @xmath0 , the conclusions are expected to apply to other nucleon current matrix elements .",
    "the presence of large uncertainties in nucleon matrix elements indicate that only small adjustments of the qcd input parameters are required to reproduce the measured values .",
    "likewise , small fluctuations in the input parameters can lead to large fluctuations in the matrix elements , such that most qcd sum rule calculations of matrix elements in the literature are likely to have 50% uncertainties at best , given the current implementation of the qcd sum rule formalism .",
