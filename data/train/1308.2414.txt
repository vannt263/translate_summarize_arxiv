    "polymer physics , with an old and venerable history , spanning more than 60 years , now occupies an important position in basic physics , providing conceptual support to wide varieties of problems @xcite .",
    "a polymer , from a physicist s point of view , is a set of units , called monomers , connected linearly as a chain .",
    "such polymers are the natural or synthetic long chain molecules formed by bonding monomers chemically as in real polymers or bio - polymers like dna , proteins etc , but they need not be restricted to those only . polymers could also be the line defects in superconductors and other ordered media , the domain walls in two dimensional systems and so on .",
    "even if non - interacting , a polymer by virtue of its connectivity brings in correlations between monomers situated faraway along the chain .",
    "this makes a polymer different from a collection of independent monomers .",
    "the basic problem of polymer physics is then to tackle the inherent correlations due to the long length of the string like object .",
    "a gas of @xmath0 isolated monomers at any nonzero temperature @xmath1 would like to occupy the whole available volume to maximize the entropy but that would not be the case when they are connected linearly as a polymer .",
    "this brings in a quantity very special to polymers , namely the equilibrium size of a polymer , in addition to the usual thermodynamic quantities .",
    "traditionally thermodynamic quantities , at least for large @xmath0 , are expected to show extensivity , i.e. , proportionality to the number of constituent units , but the size of a polymer in thermal equilibrium need not respect that . in other words ,",
    "if the length of a polymer is doubled , the size need not change by the same factor .",
    "consequently even the usual thermodynamic quantities would have an extra polymer length dependence which will not necessarily be extensive but would encode the special polymeric correlations mentioned above .",
    "how the equilibrium size of a polymer changes or scales , as its length is increased , whether this dependence shows any signature of phase transitions with any external parameter like temperature , and the consequent effects on other properties are some of the questions one confronts in the studies of polymers .",
    "the success of exact methods , scaling arguments and the renormalization group crafted the statistical physics approach to polymer physics into a well defined and recognized field .",
    "one of the first , and most successful , theoretical approaches to thermophysical properties of polymers , is the celebrated flory theory , that will be the central topic of this review .",
    "this simple argument was a key step in the history of critical phenomena , especially , in seeing the emergence of power laws and the role of dimensionality .",
    "for the special effects of long range correlations that develop near a critical point , one needs a fine tuning of parameters like temperature , pressure , fields etc , to be close to that special point .",
    "in contrast , the simple flory theory showed that a polymer exhibits critical features , power laws in particular , and a dimensionality dependence beyond the purview of perturbation theories , all without any requirement of fine - tuning .",
    "here is an example of self - organized criticality - a phenomenon where a system shows critical - like features on its own without any external tuning parameter - though the name was coined decades after the flory theory .",
    "various monographs @xcite , covered different aspects of methodologies and techniques .",
    "this notwithstanding , our aim is to bring out the nuances present in the flory theory and to place it in the current context , to appreciate why this theory stands the test of time as compared to other mean - field theories .",
    "this review is organized as follows . after a recapitulation of the basic facts of a noninteracting polymer and the simple flory theory in sec .",
    "[ sec : elementary ] , we introduce the edwards continuum model @xcite ( section [ sec : edwards ] ) and the mean field approximation to its free energy ( section [ sec : flory ] ) .",
    "this forms the basis for discussing the flory approximation through a saddle - point method ( section [ subsec : steepest ] ) .",
    "the results for the three regimes of a polymer ( swollen , theta and compact ) , and the transition behaviour can also be found in the same section . how the flory theory fares when compared with the current view of scale invariance , universality and scaling is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : flory - theory - modern ] and the role of a microscopic length scale discussed there .",
    "a few modifications@xcite , and a simple extension to include external forces applied to one extreme of the polymer , are discussed in sections [ subsec : elastic ] and [ subsec : inclusion ] , respectively .    while the original flory theory describes the size at a fixed temperature , as the number of monomers increases , it is possible to go beyond power laws in the current framework .",
    "the analysis allows one to discuss the temperature dependence of the size at a fixed number of monomers ( assumed to be sufficiently large ) .",
    "this cross - over effect is discussed in section[sec : crossover ] .",
    "a particularly interesting case appears to be the two - dimensional case , discussed in section [ sec : explicit ] , where the scaling function can be computed exactly .",
    "section [ subsec : uniform ] also includes the uniform expansion method @xcite along with its relationship with a perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "besides the three states mentioned above , there is an obvious state of a polymer , namely a stretched or a rod like state .",
    "this state can be achieved by a force at one end , keeping the other end fixed , or by assigning a penality for bending . in absence of any interaction",
    ", there is no transition from this rod - like state to any of the other states .",
    "but still , for completeness , the universal features of the crossover behaviour needs to be discussed .",
    "this is done in the last part of the paper .",
    "it is devoted to the semiflexible chain , where bending rigidity competes with entropy .",
    "the response of the polymer when a pulling force is applied to an extremum is discussed in section [ sec : semiflexible ] , with an eye on the interpolating formula between flexible and semiflexible regimes@xcite .",
    "ancillary results for the structure factor and the end - to - end distance will also be presented in section [ subsec : structure ] .",
    "several technical issues are relegated to the appendixes .",
    "a few gaussian transformations that are frequently employed are listed in appendix [ app : hubbard ] .",
    "a discussion on the central limit theorem as applied to polymers and a possible deviation can be found in appendix [ app : distribution ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] , the theoretical framework of perturbation theory@xcite , is introduced at the simplest possible level , and the lowest order calculation is explicitly performed to show how the method works . finally , for completness , appendices [ app : structure_gaussian ] , [ app : exact ] , [ app : green ] , [ app : integral ] include the explicit derivation of some results that are used in the main text .",
    "we end this introduction with a few definitions . if all the monomers , and therefore the bonds , can be taken as similar , then the polymer is called a homopolymer .",
    "if there is any heterogeneity either in monomers or in bonds , it will be a heteropolymer . in case of two types of monomers arranged in a regular pattern , the polymer",
    "is called a co - polymer .",
    "two different types of polymers connected together is an example of a block - copolymer .",
    "this review focuses on the homopolymer case only .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath2 to denote the dependence on certain quantities , ignoring prefactors and dimensional analysis , while the symbol @xmath3 is to be used for approximate equality .",
    "consider an isolated homopolymer formed by @xmath4 monomers at positions @xmath5 in space , and let @xmath6 be the monomer - monomer distance ( sometimes also referred to as the kuhn length ) .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",

    "the size of the monomers could be indicative of the excluded volume interaction of the monomers .",
    "( c ) a bead spring model where the harmonic springs take care of the polymer connectivity .",
    "( d ) continuum model - no details of the polymeric structure is important .",
    "the location of a monomer is given by a length @xmath9.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we further introduce the bond variable @xmath10 and the end - to - end distance @xmath11 , @xmath12 a flexible polymer is defined as one for which the bond vectors are completely independent so that each bond can orient in any direction in space irrespective of the orientations of the others .",
    "this freedom is expressed as an absence of any correlation between _ any _ two different bonds , that is @xmath13 this is the basis of the freely - jointed chain(fjc ) . as the monomer - monomer distance is fixed , the average in eq.([elementary : eq2 ] ) is an average over all possible orientations .",
    "this ensemble averaging is denoted by the angular brackets @xmath14 .",
    "a more realistic model , where there is an orientational correlation between successive bonds , called worm - like chain model ( wlc ) ( or kratky - porod model ) , is the paradigm of the stiff polymer , and will be discussed later on .",
    "a use of eqs.([elementary : eq1 ] ) and ( [ elementary : eq2 ] ) leads to @xmath15 so that the size @xmath16 , measured by the root mean square ( rms ) end - to - end distance of a polymer , depends on its length @xmath0 as @xmath17 with @xmath18 for the fjc .",
    "the exponent @xmath19 is called the size exponent .",
    "we are using the rms value as the size of the polymer because by symmetry ( i.e. isotropy ) @xmath20 . a judicious choice of origin",
    "can always remove a non - zero average of any probability distribution , whereas it would be impossible to make the variance zero .",
    "hence the importance of the rms value as a measure of the size .",
    "the behavior described by eq.([eq:2 ] ) can be also read as follows . if a sphere of radius @xmath16 is drawn with its center in a random position along the chain , the total length of the polymer contained in the sphere is about @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being what is known as the _ fractal dimension_. so , the fractal dimension of our non - interacting polymer is @xmath23 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath24 of the end - to - end distance is a gaussian ( see appendix [ app : distribution ] for details ) and in @xmath25 it is ( see eq.[distribution : eq12 ] ) @xmath26 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the standard deviation , that determines the width of this distribution , gives the rms size @xmath16 of eq . .",

    "the size of a polymer discussed above is an example of a critical - like power law whose origin can be traced to correlations .",

    "to go beyond the gaussian behaviour , let us introduce the repulsive interaction of the monomers , _",
    "e.g. _ , the athermal excluded volume interaction .",
    "the question is how this repulsion of the monomers affects the size of the polymer .",
    "does it just change the amplitude in eq .",
    "or it changes the exponent ?",
    "a change in the exponent needs to be taken more seriously than in the amplitude because the latter is equivalent to a change in the unit of measurement while the former changes the fractal dimension of the polymer .",
    "a simple way to accounting for the fact that non - consecutive spheres ( i.e. monomers ) can not interpenetrate , is provided by a hard - sphere repulsion , that is proportional to the excluded volume @xmath41 of each pair of monomers , times the number of monomer pairs ( @xmath42 ) per unit of available volume ( @xmath43 ) , that is @xmath44 the total free energy @xmath45 of the system can then be quickly estimated as follows @xcite .    from eq.([elementary",

    "is to be interpreted as the free energy of a polymer chain of @xmath0 monomers with excluded volume interaction _ if _ it had a size of radius @xmath16 .",
    "the size of an unconstrained polymer would come from a minimization of @xmath45 with respect to @xmath16 which amounts to equating the two @xmath16-dependent terms in eq.([elementary : eq11 ] ) .",
    "the size still has the form of eq . , but with @xmath56 this @xmath19 is called the flory exponent .",
    "this is the most elementary version of the flory theory that experienced a remarkable success in explaining the experimental evidence in swelling of real polymers .",
    "this success is thought to be accidental , but we shall see later on that more systematic arguments do lead to eqs . and .",
    "the above argument can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions @xmath57 .",
    "the entropy term as given by eq . is independent of @xmath57 , but the excluded volume term in eq .",
    "would be replaced by @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the volume occupied by the polymer .",
    "a minimization of the free energy then gives the flory exponent as @xmath60 .",
    "however , for @xmath61 , it gives a size exponent less than @xmath62 , which is not possible , because a repulsion can not make a polymer more compact than a free chain .",
    "one therefore expects the free chain value @xmath18 , so that the general flory exponent would be @xmath63                 \\frac{1}{2 } ,   & { \\rm{for}}\\   d > 4 , &                   \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which agrees with the known exact results like , @xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath67 , @xmath18 for @xmath61 and is very close to the best estimate @xmath68 known for @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the case of attractive interaction may also be mentioned here . with attraction , and hard - core repulsion",
    ", the monomers would like to stay as close as possible .",
    "this gives a more or less compact packing of spheres so that the monomer density inside a sphere enclosing the polymer is o@xmath69 in @xmath0 .",

    "however , the probabilities being in the tail of the gaussian distribution , are too small to contribute to the average .",

    "[ sec : elementary ] , we have proceeded by introducing the edwards continuum approach in sec.[sec : edwards ] that is used as a toolbox for field - theoretical approaches to polymer physics .",
    "one of the reasons that stimulated us to review this topic derives from the fact that the flory theory is frequently exploited , in different forms , as a theoretical tool to tackle remarkably complex systems .",

    "we have also tried to cast the flory theory within some modern perspective ( see sec.[sec : flory - theory - modern ] ) that included the scaling theory , and critical exponents .",
    "the flory mean - field approach can be simply modified by the addition of an external force , as described in section [ sec : semiflexible ] ) , and this technique has become particularly useful in the last two decades due to the remarkable improvements in the experimental control of the single - molecule stretching , with far reaching consequences in various biological systems , most notably dna .",
