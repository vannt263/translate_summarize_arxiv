    "viscoelasticity is ubiquitous in many materials ranging from biological fluids , polymers , micellar systems , colloidal suspensions and more . in general ,",
    "such materials are characterized by a strongly time - dependent mechanical response to stress or strain .",
    "for instance , in case of an oscillatory shear , they may exhibit either liquid or solid - like properties depending on the imposed frequency  @xcite .",
    "such non - newtonian behavior originates from the storage and dissipation of energy within their complex microstructure which gives rise to a finite macroscopic stress - relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "given the abundance of systems which involve the interplay between microscale viscoelastic flows and embedded micron - sized objects , as typically found in lab - on - a - chip devices  @xcite , porous media  @xcite , and in active matter  @xcite , the understanding of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium dynamics of colloidal particles in viscoelastic fluids is a noteworthy topic in soft matter .",
    "microrheology has become in recent years a field which successfully addresses some of these problems . in particular , it provides alternative methods to bulk rheology to investigate flow and deformation properties of microlitre samples of viscoelastic materials .",
    "for example , linear shear moduli can be inferred in passive microrheology from the thermal fluctuations of suspended colloidal particles via a generalized stokes - einstein relation  @xcite . on the other hand , in active microrheology small - amplitude oscillatory forces",
    "can be applied to the particle , which enables the dynamical measurement of the linear viscoelastic response of the surrounding fluid  @xcite .",
    "more recent developments of active microrheology have aimed to probe nonlinear response of complex fluids by perturbing their microstructure far away from equilibrium .",
    "this has been achieved by dragging or rotating the probe through the fluid at sufficiently large constant force or torque @xcite , or at constant velocity  @xcite , thus inducing e.g. thinning .    despite multiple potential applications of microrheology ,",
    "so far most of the experiments have focused on the study of linear - response or steady - state quantities .",
    "more complex transient behavior observed macroscopically , e.g. nonlinear creep , stress relaxation and strain recovery , is far less well understood within the context of microrheology .",
    "indeed , theoretical works suggest that the drag force acting on a colloidal probe driven through a non - newtonian fluid , strongly depends on the spatio - temporal deformation of the microstructure of the surrounding fluid  @xcite . therefore , in contrast to newtonian liquids , where a low reynolds number guarantees simple stokesian flows and linear - response drag forces , it is questionable whether this is applicable when a particle is dragged by a time - dependent driving force over large distances through a viscoelastic medium  @xcite . then , it is not evident which kind of rheological properties of the fluid can be extracted by simply tracking the position of a probe in response to a pulsed or heaviside time - dependent driving force .",
    "it should be mentioned that such a time - dependent force represents the microrheological analogue to a macroscopic flow startup / cessation experiment  @xcite , where the time evolution of the stress ( strain ) is measured upon suddenly imposing or relieving strain ( stress ) , respectively .",
    "although relevant for further developments of microrheology and for the general understanding of the motion of micron - sized particles in viscoelastic media , these questions have not been experimentally investigated so far .    in this work ,",
    "we study the local microstructural recovery of several viscoelastic fluids by means of microrheology .",
    "for this purpose , we drag spherical particles at constant velocity through them using optical tweezers , thus inducing strain , and then we studdenly remove the trapping force .",
    "we observe that the particle recoils after removal of the trap until the complete recovery of the investigated fluid .",
    "we find that the transient particle dynamics during the recovery proceeds via a double exponential relaxation , whose relaxation times remain independent of the initial particle velocity whereas their amplitudes strongly depend on it .",
    "these processes reveal how the elastic energy stored by the fluid due to a large local strain is eventually dissipated . while the fastest relaxation mirrors the viscous damping of the particle by the solvent , the slow process results from the relaxation of the viscoelastic matrix . in particular , we show that this experimental method allows to probe linear and nonlinear transient rheological behavior of the viscoelastic fluid under study and to extract unambiguously its stress - relaxation time .",
    "in addition , our findings have important consequences on the understanding and interpretation of the motion of colloids actively driven through viscoelastic media .",
    "thus , we provide clear experimental evidence that , unlike passive and small - amplitude oscillatory microrheology , the active motion of a colloidal particle over large distances does not only probe the bulk viscoelastic properties of the fluid but is also affected by the flow field and deformation imposed by the particle .",

    "the particle motion at time @xmath38 is subjected to the relaxation of the previously strained microstructure of the fluid .",

    "in particular , it fails to reproduce the slow relaxation inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) after cessation of a large deformation imposed by the driven particle .",
    "the reason is that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq2 ] ) only accounts for the coarse - grained drag force exerted by the fluid .",
    "such a viscoelastic drag force is enough to describe equilibrium thermal fluctuations of the particle position without recourse to any information on the surrounding flow field .",
    "however , it does not incorporate the effect of the transient flow and deformation localized around the particle when dragged over large distances , and which can not be neglected during the recovery process of the fluid . in the simplistic langevin picture ,",
    "the only possible channel for the system to reach thermal equilibrium is by means of the effective relaxation of the particle position .",
    "while this relaxation probes the linear bulk properties of the fluid , it ignores the complete stress relaxation of the local viscoelastic flow field .",
    "in fact , the aforementioned drawbacks suggest that , in reality , the residual slow relaxation represents a second mechanism to completely release the stress stored by the strained fluid .",
    "the two relaxation mechanisms allow in turn the fluid to reach thermal equilibrium in conjunction with the particle motion .",
    "these observations hint at the stress - relaxation time @xmath103 of the fluid as the slow relaxation time @xmath66 . in order to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we perform using a rotational rheometer ( haake rheostress 1 , double - gap cylinder geometry ) the macroscopic version of the transient microrheology experiments , this is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) and [ fig : fig4](b ) , where we plot an example of the time evolution of the shear stress @xmath100 applied to a wormlike micellar solution , and the resulting shear strain @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "after reaching a steady state with constant shear rate @xmath99 at time @xmath163 , the shear stress is suddently removed at @xmath164 , and afterwards @xmath162 decays in time , until the fluid completely recovers .",
    "then , we extract the relaxation time @xmath103 of the fluid from the exponential fit @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) we plot @xmath66 , as a function of the corresponding @xmath103 for all the investigated viscoelastic fluids .",
    "we find that within the experimental errors , both time - scales are equal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](c ) we also verify that the relaxation times @xmath66 are independent of the size of the probe particle .",
    "see  [ appb ] for more detailed results obtained for different particle sizes .",
    "the independence of @xmath66 from @xmath24 , @xmath146 and @xmath166 , i.e. from the detailed flow and strain field around the particle , demonstrates that it is a physical property inherent to the viscoelastic fluid .",
    "thus , this time - scale fixes a value above which the memory on the storage of elastic energy by the fluid microstructure is lost .",
    "hence , the the slow transient dynamics of a colloidal probe after removal of a driving force represents a new straightforward method to measure the stress - relaxation time of viscoelastic fluids , provided that the previous driven motion induces a sufficiently large strain .",
    "this can be directly carried out by means of particle tracking without the need of any model for the dynamics or any further elaborate fourier or laplace analysis , as commonly done in passive and small - amplitude active microrheology  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the slow relaxation is most prominent close to the onset of nonlinear microrheological response around @xmath86 , as verified by the presence of the maxima of @xmath68 in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) , [ fig : figpaamdna](b ) and [ fig : figpaamdna](e )",
    ". therefore , our findings have important consequences on the interpretation of transient behavior in active microrheology under large deformations  @xcite .",
    "this is because they provide experimental evidence that , even at small weissenberg number , where only linear microrheological response is expected to occur , the response of the colloidal particle is strongly affected by the relaxation of the local flow and strain field around it .",
    "this is in contrast to passive and active microrheology under small - amplitude deformations , where only bulk properties of the fluid are probed by the particle .",
    "in addition , our results have significant implications for the behavior of micron - sized objects in transient viscoelastic flows , such as those typically found in microchannels , where large strains are commonly induced by high flow rates and sharp constrictions . in such systems , unlike the case of newtonian liquids , the conventional langevin description for the suspended particles involving only coarse - grained drag forces and noise must break down . furthermore , our results are particularly important for the understanding and modelling of the motion of biological microswimmers , e.g. bacteria and spermatozoa , whose natural environment is frequently viscoelastic  @xcite .",
    "such active systems usually operate at high weissenberg number and travel large distances through the viscoelastic medium , thus inducing complex flow fields and large strains . therefore",
    ", the relaxation of the elastic energy stored by the surrounding fluid microstructure can strongly impact their swimming mechanisms through the different processes found in our experiments .",
    "we have experimentally studied the motion of a colloidal probe during the local strain recovery of several viscoelastic fluids upon shutoff of an active driving force .",
    "we have shown that , even when a langevin model correctly describes linear response dynamics of the particle position under vanishingly small strain , it can not capture its transient dynamics during the recovery process when large deformations are previously induced by large displacements of the particle through the fluid . in particular , we have found that this transient dynamics proceeds via a double exponential decay , which reveals the cooperative relaxation to thermal equilibrium of the particle and the surrounding strained fluid .",
    "we have shown that the fastest relaxation mirrors the viscous damping of the particle by the solvent , whereas the slow one results from the relaxation of the viscoelastic matrix .",
    "thus , the two relaxation processes represent dissipation channels for the elastic energy stored by the fluid microstructure upon cessation of a sufficiently large deformation .",
    "we have demonstrated that , while the amplitudes of these relaxation modes encode either linear or nonlinear microrheological information of the fluid induced during the prior driving , their relaxation times are insensitive to it .",
    "consequently , this transient microrheological method allows to determine unambiguously stress - relaxation times of micro - litre samples of viscoelastic fluids .",
