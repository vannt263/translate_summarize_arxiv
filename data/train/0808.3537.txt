    "in quantum information applications based on optically addressed atoms or ions it is often necessary to prepare these elements in specific hyperfine or zeeman spin levels .",
    "typically this involves optical pumping from one ground - state spin level to another via an excited state .",
    "the preparation of the ions into a single well - defined state ( spin polarization ) is a required initial step for quantum memory protocols based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , raman interactions @xcite and photon echoes using controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) @xcite or atomic frequency combs ( afc ) @xcite . in particular , the implementation of these protocols in rare earth ( re ) ion doped solids @xcite requires spectral tailoring of the inhomogeneous absorption in order to isolate narrow absorption peaks .    among the various physical systems that have been considered for photonic quantum state storage , erbium doped solids",
    "provide a unique system where a large number of stationary atoms can coherently absorb photons at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.53 @xmath4 m .",
    "quantum memories at telecommunication wavelengths are required for a range of efficient quantum repeater protocols @xcite .",
    "in addition , erbium doped solids have exceptional optical coherence properties . an optical coherence time as long as 6.4",
    "ms has been measured in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 @xcite , which represents the longest optical coherence time measured in a solid .",
    "another interesting property of er@xmath5 is that it is a kramers ion with an odd number of electrons .",
    "this results in a large splitting between the ground state levels via a first order zeeman interaction , which leads to a larger accessible frequency bandwidth for quantum memory applications .",
    "however , the unquenched electronic spin of kramers ions results in strong spin - spin and spin - phonon interactions as compared to non kramers ions such as pr and eu . therefore the ground state population relaxation times are much shorter than in non kramers ions , usually in the range of tens to hundreds of ms @xcite . in order to achieve a high degree of population transfer via optical pumping",
    "it is necessary for the ground state lifetime to be much longer than the excited state lifetime .",
    "achieving efficient population transfer in erbium doped materials seems thus particularly challenging .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 have been extensively studied , including optical coherence @xcite , spectral diffusion @xcite , hyperfine structure @xcite , zeeman relaxation lifetimes @xcite , zeeman g factors @xcite and erbium - host interactions @xcite .",
    "slow light has also been achieved in this material using coherent population oscillation @xcite . however , to our knowledge no study has been reported on the possibility to implement efficient population transfer between the two zeeman ground states to achieve a high degree of spin polarization .    in this article",
    "we investigate optical pumping between ground state zeeman levels of erbium ions doped into a y@xmath6sio@xmath7 crystal .",
    "we first observe the limitation of standard optical pumping . for er@xmath5y@xmath0sio@xmath1 an optical relaxation time of 11 ms @xcite and a zeeman relaxation lifetime of about 130 ms ( at a magnetic field of 1.2 mt ) @xcite",
    "have been measured .",
    "the low ratio between these two relaxation lifetimes strongly limits the achievable population transfer efficiency .",
    "another limiting factor is the branching ratio between the two optical transitions connecting the two ground state zeeman levels .",
    "we then show how an enhancement of the optical pumping efficiency can be achieved by decreasing the excited state lifetime via optical stimulated emission and by improving spin branching ratios via radio frequency ( rf ) excitation .",
    "these techniques allow population transfer between the two zeeman states with less than 10@xmath2 of the total population remaining in the initial state , i.e. more than 90@xmath2 spin polarization .",
    "we also demonstrate spectral tailoring in this crystal by preparing a narrow absorption line inside wide transparency window ( spectral pit ) , as required for the crib quantum memory scheme .",
    "population transfer between the two closely spaced ground state levels of a @xmath8-system can be achieved by optical pumping via the excited state level . in an optical pumping experiment ,",
    "atoms are excited by a laser in resonance with the transition connecting one of the ground state to the excited state .",
    "the excited atoms can then decay into both ground states .",
    "those which have decayed to the ground state which is not connected to the laser will in principle remain there for a time corresponding to the relaxation time between the ground states .",
    "if enough pumping cycles can be done within this time , the population from the initial ground state can be entirely transferred to the second ground state .",
    "the efficiency of this transfer is thus limited by the ratio of the excited state lifetime ( @xmath9 ) and the spin population lifetime of the ground state levels ( which we label @xmath10 , since in our case the ground state levels are zeeman levels ) as well as the branching factor @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is defined as the probability of the ion to relax into its initial state via spontaneous emission .",
    "transition ( solid line ) .",
    "the probe transitions ( dashed lines ) are labelled and the positions of the corresponding holes and antiholes in the transmission spectrum are shown below .",
    "the zeeman splitting of the ground and the excited state level , respectively , is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the g factors for the ground and the excited state , respectively , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton and @xmath16 the magnetic field .",
    "note that in addition to those shown in the figure , further side- and antiholes occur that are due to the inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption line @xcite .",
    "b ) to enhance the efficiency of the population transfer the excited state lifetime is artificially lowered by stimulated emission to the short - lived second kramers doublet of the ground state ( z@xmath0 ) . ]    in materials with inhomogeneous broadening , population transfer by optical pumping is usually realized and investigated with spectral holeburning ( shb ) techniques . in this scheme ,",
    "the pump laser of frequency @xmath17 ( in resonance with transition 1 , fig .",
    "[ levelscheme]a ) is focused on the sample for a duration @xmath18 , the burning time .",
    "ions that are in resonance with @xmath17 are transferred to the excited state . in order to probe the transmission ,",
    "a weak pulse follows after a delay @xmath19 during which the frequency of the laser is scanned around @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ setup ] b ) .",
    "the inhomogeneously broadened absorption shows a spectral hole at @xmath17 which in general decays with the excited state lifetime @xmath9 .",
    "some of the ions will however relax into the second ground state zeeman level . if the temperature is low enough ( @xmath20 k ) such that zeeman levels are thermally decoupled @xcite , the population of this level",
    "will then be increased and the absorption at @xmath21 ( transition 4 in fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] a ) will be enhanced .",
    "this enhancement is called a spectral anti - hole .",
    "it will decay with the zeeman lifetime @xmath10 .",
    "as long as the population in the two zeeman levels has not relaxed to thermal equilibrium , a part of the spectral hole at @xmath22 will persist . in case of a population transfer",
    "the hole should thus show two different decay times : @xmath9 from ions that decay from the excited back to the initial state and @xmath10 from ions that relax into the second zeeman level .",
    "the occurrence of the anti - hole and the long decay time ( @xmath10 ) for the central hole apparently provide evidence of population transfer . throughout this article",
    "we speak of this method as the standard optical pumping scheme .",
    "the intensity of the transmitted light is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the intensity of the incident radiation , and @xmath25 the length of the sample .",
    "the absorption coefficient @xmath26 , i.e. the logarithm of the transmitted intensity , gives rise to the relation between the number of ions @xmath27 in the ground and the excited state .",
    "@xmath28 is the cross - section of the transition and can be considered as a constant . since in this work rather the population than the measured intensities themselves are of interest , all curves that deal with quantities related to the absorption and transmission , respectively , ( such as the area or the depth of a spectral hole ) are given with respect to the natural logarithm of the measured intensity .    to qualitatively understand the limiting factors in the population transfer process",
    ", one can use a simple rate equation model for a three level @xmath8 system . for the steady state in the case of standard optical pumping ( see appendix ) it is easy to derive that the ratio of populations in the ground states after optical pumping depends on the ratio between the zeeman lifetime @xmath10 and the excited state lifetime @xmath9 :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the population fraction in the initial ( final ) zeeman state .",
    "however , this holds only for the case in which all of the excited ions relax into the desired level . in re - doped solids",
    "the selection rule for the electronic spin @xmath32 normally is only slightly lifted by the crystal field and only a small part of the ions can be found in this decay channel .",
    "this motivates to introduce an effective lifetime in the following manner : @xmath33 the branching factor @xmath34 being the probability that an ion will preserve its electron spin upon relaxation from the excited to the ground state .",
    "if @xmath11 is low , the pump rate has to be accordingly high to transfer population into the excited state . on the other hand",
    "a low branching factor is desirable if one wants the ions to relax into the second zeeman level .",
    "the ratio between ions in either of the two ground state levels is then given by @xmath35 ( see appendix ) .",
    "in previous measurements on er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 an excited state lifetime of @xmath36ms and a branching factor @xmath370.9 were found @xcite .",
    "this leads to an effective lifetime of @xmath38 ms which is of the same order as @xmath39 130 ms @xcite .",
    "according to the model it is thus impossible to perform efficient population transfer between the zeeman ground states of er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 using standard optical pumping .",
    "however , by looking at eq.[lifetimeratio ] and eq .",
    "[ efflifetimeratio ] , one can devise methods to increase the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "a first idea is to improve the lifetime ratio by artificially increasing the decay rate from the excited state .",
    "this can be achieved by using stimulated emission to another short lived ground state level ( see fig.[levelscheme]b ) as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in section [ stimulated ] .",

    "[ levelscheme ] ) is low , in contrast to what one would expect in the case of an efficient transfer of population .",
    "these observations show that the created spectral hole is mostly due to a storage of population in the excited state .",
    "thus , as expected from the arguments given in section [ theory ] , optical pumping alone does not suffice to prepare the system into the required state .      a first possible solution to improve the optical pumping efficiency is to artificially increase the decay rate from the excited state by stimulating the emission to another short lived ground state level ( see fig .",

    "y@xmath69 z@xmath0 ( 1546 nm , @xcite ) is applied simultaneously with the pump laser . due to a strong coupling to phonon modes , mostly due to direct phonon emission , the excited crystal field levels ( z@xmath0 , z@xmath70 , ... ) have non - radiative decay times in the range of nano- or picoseconds .",
    "thus , population from these levels will immediately relax into ground state ( z@xmath41 ) .",
    "we first characterize the stimulation process by measuring its dependence on the frequency of the stimulation laser .",
    "since the homogeneous broadening of the transition is expected to be larger than the inhomogeneous broadening @xcite , due to the short non - radiative decay times , this gives a direct measure of the homogeneous linewidth .",
    "it has been done by measuring the size of the spectral hole as a function of the frequency of the stimulation laser at 4.1 k. at this temperature the ground state zeeman levels are thermally coupled @xcite and therefore only ions in the excited state ( i.e. ions that have not been stimulated down ) contribute to the hole .",

    "the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the pump pulse .",
    "we see that when the stimulation laser is in resonance , the spectral hole almost completely vanishes , which shows that one can efficiently empty the excited state using this method .",
    "we find the linewidth to be about 14 ghz , which corresponds to a lifetime in the picosecond range .",

    "another quantity of interest is the rate at which stimulation laser moves the ions down from the excited to the ground state ( z@xmath0 ) . to measure this quantity a pump pulse with @xmath71 100ms",
    "was sent into the sample .",
    "the crystal temperature was chosen to be 4.3 k so that also in this case the size of the hole would only be given by the fraction of ions that remained in the excited state . simultaneously to the pump pulse a stimulation pulse with a duration @xmath58 was applied ( see figure [ setup]b ) .",

    "[ application ] one can see that the application of the stimulation laser simultaneously with the pump laser indeed leads to a significant enhancement of the transfer efficiency .",
    "the decay of the spectral hole at a temperature of 2.1 k is shown for the case of standard optical pumping ( open circles ) and optical pumping assisted by stimulated emission ( plain triangles ) . for standard optical pumping , the decay is dominated by the time constant @xmath9=11ms as explained in section [ standard ] .",
    "in contrast , the decay for the stimulated optical pumping is dominated by a slower decay time , which corresponds to @xmath75 ms .",
    "this indicates that a significant part of the population is now transferred to the other zeeman level by the optical pumping process .",

    "the stimulation power the figure shows the absorption at about @xmath76 ms after the burning pulse .",
    "for this measurement , a 10 mhz sweep was applied on the pump laser and the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the pump pulse and the stimulation power in front of the cryostat was 50 mw . ]    this hypothesis is confirmed by directly measuring the residual absorption after the optical pumping , as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "the enhanced absorption which occurs in form of wide anti - holes on both sides of the pit confirms , as explained in section [ theory ] , that the population was transferred as intended . from this measurement , it is possible to estimate the efficiency of the population transfer .",
    "the fraction of ions remaining in the initial zeeman state @xmath79 can be estimated by : @xmath80 0.25 . since initially the two zeeman states are equally populated , this means that 12.5 @xmath2 of the total number of atoms is remaining in the initial state , within the frequency range optically pumped .",
    "if one assumes that all atoms that are not in the initial state have been transferred to the other zeeman level , on can compute the ratio @xmath81=7 .",
    "this is much lower than what can be expected from the simple model presented in section [ theory ] ( see also appendix ) .",
    "this shows that , while the model presented helps to understand the process of optical pumping , it is too simplified to give quantitative estimations .",
    "although stimulated optical pumping greatly increases the population transfer efficiency , the fraction of ions remaining in the initial ground state is still high .",

    "this shows the potential of er doped solids for obtaining large frequency bandwidths for quantum storage applications .",
    "erbium doped solids are promising candidates for the implementation of quantum memories at telecommunication wavelengths .",
    "we have shown and discussed the difficulties for state preparation by optical pumping in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 , including the ratio between the excited state and the zeeman lifetimes and the branching factor @xmath11 . with stimulated emission assisted optical pumping and spin - mixing using rf excitations ,",
    "we have investigated two methods to alleviate these problems .",
    "we have shown that their application indeed leads to a significant enhancement of the optical pumping efficiency .",
    "population transfer between two zeeman levels with less than 10@xmath2 of the total population in the initial level has been demonstrated .",
    "this corresponds to a spin polarization of 90@xmath2 .",
    "note that the techniques used here can also be applied to other rare earth doped solids .",
    "in particular , the might be useful to enhance optical pumping efficiency in other kramers ions , such as neodymium @xcite .",
    "further improvements might be obtained by increasing stimulation rates with higher laser powers and using coherent rf population transfer between the two excited states .",
    "another possibility to improve the branching ratio could be to apply the magnetic field at particular angles where the spin conservation selection rule is relaxed @xcite . in order to increase the population lifetime of zeeman levels",
    ", it might be interesting to work at higher magnetic field ( hundreds of mt ) , in order to reduce spin - spin interactions .",
    "other crystals might also be explored , e.g. y@xmath6o@xmath88 , to search for longer zeeman lifetimes .",
    "finally , it would also be interesting to investigate hyperfine states , which might have longer spin population relaxation lifetimes @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrated spectral tailoring in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 by isolating a narrow absorption peak within a wide transparency window , as required for the crib quantum memory scheme .",
    "although further progress remains to be done to improve the population transfer efficiency with higher optical depth , the achievement of spectral tailoring in erbium doped solids will allow proof of principle experiments of light storage with quantum memory protocols .",
    "hence , with this work a further step towards a solid state based quantum memory at telecom wavelength has been accomplished .",
    "we would like to thank marko lovric and roman kolesov for their advice concerning the design of the rf - setup .",
    "furthermore would we like to thank the group of prof .",
    "d. van der marel , mehdi brandt , d. van mechelen , and violeta guritanu for experimental assistance , as well as prof .",
    "m. chergui ( epfl ) for loaning us the cryostat .",
    "tecnical support by c. barreiro and j.d .",
    "gauthier is acknowledged .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss nccr quantum photonics and the european commission under the integrated project qubit applications ( qap ) funded by the ist directorate .",
    "the low efficiency of the population transfer was ascribed to the the ratio between the excited state lifetime @xmath9 and the ground state zeeman lifetime @xmath10 as well as the branching factor @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding formulas ( [ lifetimeratio ] and [ efflifetimeratio ] , section [ theory ] ) were found using the following simple rate equation model :        let @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 be the population fraction in the two ground and in the excited state , respectively , as shown in figure [ popratio ] .",
    "the laser is in resonance with the transition between level 1 and 3 . for the population of the second zeeman",
    "ground state level the population dynamics is given by @xmath92 @xmath93 is the einstein - coefficient for spontaneous emission @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the spin - lattice - relaxation rates .",
    "in the case considered by gorju et al .",
    "@xcite a term which corresponds to @xmath94 does not occur since the target state is a crystal field level and the relevant phonon decay is a one way process",
    ". however , the calculations are still quite similar . in the steady state",
    "it is @xmath96    where the second equality holds for the case of sufficiently high pump power , i.e. a saturation of the considered transition .",
    "if we further assume @xmath97 , which is a good approximation since the thermal energy @xmath98 is much larger than the splitting between the two levels , it follows from equation [ dynamics ] that the ratio between the number of ions in either of the lower states is given by @xmath99 the factor 2 in the numerator of the lifetime ratio occurs since @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "so far it is assumed that all ions decay into the second zeeman level . in this case @xmath101 .",
    "however , one has to take into account that only a fraction of the ions in the excited state will do so .",
    "supposing that the excited state lifetime is given by @xmath102 with @xmath103 and with the definition of the branching factor @xmath104 ( which gives @xmath105 ) we can define the effective lifetime @xmath106 plugging this into equation [ ratio1app ] we get @xmath107      in the case of stimulated emission as presented in section [ stimulated ] the spontaneous emission rate @xmath108 has to be replaced with the stimulation rate @xmath109 . due to its extremely low lifetime , the role of the level z@xmath0 ( figure [ levelscheme ] ) can be neglected . according to equation [ ratio2app ] population ratio is now given by @xmath110 if one considers a branching factor @xmath111 and a stimulation rate of @xmath112khz , with a zeeman lifetime of 100 ms we compute a ratio of 71 , which is significantly higher ( @xmath113 one order of magnitude ) than found in the experiment .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the model is extremely simplified as compared to reality . among others",
    "the role of other decay channels and the possibility of a different branching factor for a decay from the z@xmath0 level could not been taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , this model can help to understand the processes of optical pumping in the system qualitatively ."
