    "brane worlds scenarios have attracted much interest over the past years @xcite .",
    "these assume our world to be a @xmath0brane , i.e. a @xmath1dimensional submanifold embedded in a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "while the standard matter fields are confined to the brane , gravity lives in all dimensions .",
    "the idea that matter is confined to a lower dimensional manifold is not a new one .",
    "the localization of fermions on a domain wall has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "recently , it was newly motivated by results from string theory . in type",
    "i string theory so - called dp - branes exist on which open strings , which represent matter fields , end . gravitational fields , which are represented by closed strings , live in the full dimensions .",
    "as is well known , newton s law in four dimensions is well tested down to @xmath2 mm .",
    "thus appropriate brane world models should localise gravity `` well enough '' to the 3-brane . in the so - called randall - sundrum ( rs )",
    "models @xcite the space - time contains two ( rsi ) , respectively one ( rsii ) ricci - flat 3-brane(s ) embedded in a 5-dimensional anti - de - sitter ( ads ) bulk . for the localisation of gravity in these models , the brane tension has to be fine - tuned to the negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the rsi model proposes a possible solution to the hierarchy problem , which can be solved if the distance between the two branes is about @xmath3 times the ads radius .",
    "although topological defects have been mainly studied in a four - dimensional space - time @xcite , they have recently been considered in the context of brane worlds .",
    "the localisation of gravity on different topological defects has been discussed @xcite .",
    "this includes domain walls @xcite , nielsen - olesen strings @xcite , monopoles ( both global @xcite and local @xcite ) in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 space - time dimensions , respectively .",
    "the 3-brane sits at the core of these higher dimensional topological defects .",
    "it was found @xcite that gravity - localising ( so - called `` warped '' ) solutions are possible if certain relations between the defect s tensions hold . while in the case of domain walls and strings , gravity can only be localised if the bulk cosmological constant is negative , for magnetic monopoles the gravity - localisation is possible for both signs of the cosmological constant .",
    "the seven - dimensional monopoles with a 3-brane residing at their core have also been discussed in @xcite for a global monopole and in @xcite for a local monopole without bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the emphasis was put on the structure of space - time depending on the value of the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "static solutions were found to be singular for the symmetry breaking scale being larger than the higher dimensional planck s constant . in the case of global monopoles",
    "this singularity appears because the deficit angle of the transverse space becomes larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the four - dimensional analogues of these solutions have been called `` supermassive '' monopoles @xcite .",
    "the singularities were shown to be removable by letting the defects cores inflate .",
    "composite topological defects have been first studied in a four - dimensional space - time .",
    "specifically a composite monopole , i.e. , a system composed by a thooft - polyakov and a global monopole , was analyzed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite ( for composite strings see @xcite ) . in @xcite the large direct interaction between the two sectors of the theory was studied and it has been found that for large enough direct interaction , the global monopole will disappear from the system and leave behind a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the problem of stability of composite monopoles has been analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to join both strategies by studying a composite monopole system of a thooft - polyakov and a global monopoles in a seven - dimensional space - time with a 3-brane residing at the core of the composite system .",
    "our bulk cosmological constant is zero .",
    "this is the seven - dimensional analogue of the solutions studied previously @xcite . for small direct interaction between the global and the gauge sector ,",
    "both defects are present and we investigate the solutions in the spirit of @xcite . for large direct interaction ,",
    "the global monopole disappears from the system and `` leaves behind '' a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the system then corresponds to the one studied in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we give the model including the ansatz and the equations of motion . in section iii , we discuss solutions for small direct interaction , i.e. 3-branes in the cores of composite monopoles , while in section iv we concentrate on large direct interactions with gravity localising solutions .",
    "we give our conclusions in section v.",
    "in the following , we shall consider a composite monopole system in a seven - dimensional space - time .",
    "the composite defect resides in the three dimensional transverse submanifold and has its core at a @xmath1dimensional world - volume .",
    "the seven - dimensional action associated with this model reads  : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the seven - dimensional gravitational constant with @xmath10 and @xmath11 denotes the @xmath6-dimensional planck constant .",
    "the matter field lagrangian density in terms of the higgs field @xmath12 , the gauge field @xmath13 and the goldstone field @xmath14 is given by  : @xmath15 with the covariant derivative of the higgs field @xmath12  : @xmath16 the field strength tensor @xmath17 and the potential @xmath18 in the system , @xmath19 denotes the gauge coupling , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the self - couplings of the higgs , respectively goldstone field , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 the respective vacuum expectation values of the higgs and goldstone fields .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is the direct interaction coupling constant between the global and local sectors discussed previously in four - dimensional models @xcite .",
    "the most general static seven - dimensional metric tensor with spherical symmetry in the extra three dimensions is given by @xcite : @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "in the line element above @xmath30 represents the metric of the @xmath31-dimensional world - volume . in the following , we shall assume that the 3-brane is ricci flat , i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "here we use the following notation for the coordinates : @xmath33 .    for the higgs and goldstone fields , we use the standard hedgehog anstze  :",
    "@xmath34 while for the gauge fields , we choose  : @xmath35 and @xmath36 the lagrangian density ( [ l ] ) is terms of these anstze then reads  : @xmath37      we introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath38 such that the equations of motion depend only on the following coupling constants : @xmath39 the seven dimensional einstein equations @xmath40 with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath41 give the following set of non - linear coupled differential equations ( the prime denotes here and in the following the derivative with respect to @xmath42 ) : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 with the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath46 and the potential @xmath47    the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath48 , implies @xmath49 consequently equations ( [ einstein1 ] ) to ( [ einstein3 ] ) are functionally dependent @xcite .",
    "combining conveniently the above equations , two differential equations for the unknown metric functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are obtained .",
    "the first combination gives : @xmath52 while the second reads : @xmath53'}{c^2x^2 m^4}-\\frac1{c^2x^2}&=&\\frac{\\alpha^2}{5}\\left(\\frac{-3u'^2}{c^2x^2}- \\frac{4(1-u^2)^2}{c^4x^4}-\\frac{5 h^2 u^2}{c^2x^2}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\left.5\\frac{f^2}{c^2x^2}-2{\\cal{u}}(h , f)\\right )   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    varying @xmath54 with respect to the matter fields we obtain the euler - lagrange equations for the higgs field function : @xmath55 for the gauge field function @xmath56 and for the goldstone field function @xmath57    it has been noticed in @xcite that the behavior of the composite system in four dimensional space - time depends strongly on the combination of the coupling constants appearing in the potential @xmath58 the case @xmath59 was studied in detail in @xcite . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the minimum of the potential is given by @xmath60 such that asymptotically @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the case @xmath63 was reinvestigated in @xcite and it was found that the boundary conditions at infinity have to be generalized for the higgs and goldstone field functions .",
    "the reason for this is that there are two possible minima for the potential : @xmath64 we give the corresponding boundary conditions for the two cases in sections iii and iv , respectively .",
    "here we shall analyse the system in the regime of small direct interaction coupling . for this case , both the local and the global monopole are present .      before to embark in a numerical analysis ,",
    "let us first investigate possible analytical solutions for the system of equation .",
    "setting the matter functions equal to their vacuum values , i.e. , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the lagrangian ( [ lagrange ] ) , we can find analytic solutions of the system determined by the equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) alone .",
    "these are by themselves of interest , but we would also expect our solutions to tend to these solutions very far away ( @xmath68 ) from the core of the composite monopole .",
    "analytic solutions for brane world space - times have been investigated for the `` pure '' global monopole case for points outside the monopole s core in @xcite .    here ,",
    "we introduce two new functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) can then be written as follows : @xmath71 it is possible to obtain the differential equation obeyed by @xmath72 only .",
    "it is : @xmath73 this differential equation is a non - linear one , consequently no general solutions could be found by us . in the following",
    ", we shall try to find particular analytic solutions to these equations . as a first trial , using the ansatz @xmath74",
    ", we found the following solution : @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 being two arbitrary constants .",
    "this corresponds to a cylinder - like solution with the constant radius of the 2-spheres equal to @xmath80 , and holds also for the `` pure '' magnetic monopole case , @xmath81 , which has been studied in @xcite .    in the case of `` pure '' global monopole",
    ", it has been found in @xcite that the constant radius of the 2-spheres is arbitrary , and the solution @xmath82 exists only for @xmath83 .",
    "we find in contrast to that for the composite case , that the radius of the 2-sphere is fixed by the coupling constants , and the solutions exist for all combinations of @xmath84 and @xmath85 as long as @xmath86 and that @xmath87 behaves exponentially .",
    "note that for @xmath88 , this solution would have the form of a gravity - localising one @xcite .",
    "however , in practice , i.e. , when integrating the equations numerically , we shall not find these type of solutions in the asymptotic region of the space - time since the assumption @xmath66 holds only very far from the core of the composite ( @xmath89 falls of power - like ) , however we always integrate on finite intervals .",
    "the solution @xmath90 that has been found for the `` pure '' global monopole case @xcite , is not a solution to the equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) .",
    "for points very far from the monopole s core , i.e. , for @xmath91 , we can neglect the @xmath92 term in ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) and we obtain the set of equations : @xmath93 this system has the following possible solution : @xmath94 @xmath95 being constant . the line element associated with this solution ( choosing @xmath96 ) is then given by : @xmath97 this is nothing else but a space - time with solid angle deficit in the three dimensional transverse submanifold , equal to the solution found for the `` pure '' global monopole case in @xcite .",
    "this result is not surprising since we would expect the global monopole to dominate the system far from the core of the composite .",
    "for the numerical construction of the solutions , we have to impose boundary conditions .",
    "we require regularity of the solutions at the origin and thus impose : @xmath98 @xmath99 while the requirement of finite energy leads to @xmath100      we have studied the case @xmath59 first , and followed in our investigation the studies in @xcite .",
    "first , we have fixed @xmath101 , @xmath102 as well as @xmath84 to some value and studied the development of the solutions for increasing @xmath85 .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    = 9.0 cm +    our results for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are shown in fig.s [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "asymptotically the behavior of the metric functions is very similar to that observed in the case of global monopoles @xcite , which is not surprising since the global monopole -in contrast to the local one - has long range fields .",
    "the function @xmath106 tends to a value smaller than unity , indicating that the space - time has a solid deficit angle which increases with increasing @xmath85 and thus increasing @xmath23 . for @xmath107",
    "the deficit angle becomes equal to @xmath7 .",
    "increasing @xmath108 beyond its critical value , @xmath109 , leads to a curvature singularity of the solutions with the metric function @xmath110 vanishing at @xmath111 and @xmath106 tending to infinity at this point . and @xmath51 present opposite singular behavior for pure global @xcite and local @xcite monopole systems , respectively . here , for the composite monopole system",
    ", we show that its singular behavior is similar to that of the global monopole one ] we show the solution for @xmath112 which has a curvature singularity at @xmath113",
    ". however , what is different here in comparison to the pure global case is that the metric function @xmath106 develops a minimum at small @xmath42 .",
    "this is a typical feature of the local monopole in curved space - time @xcite ( compare also the four - dimensional case @xcite ) and is only present for small @xmath85 .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    in fig.[fig3 ] we show the localisation of the singularity as function of @xmath114 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding values for the composite system with direct interaction ( @xmath115 ) and for the pure global monopole case . for a fixed value of @xmath114 ,",
    "the value of @xmath116 is larger for the pure global monopole in comparison to the composite system .",
    "this is related to the localisation of energy close to the core ( coming from the local monopole ) .",
    "moreover , the increase of @xmath117 increases the value of @xmath116 for a fixed @xmath114 .",
    "now we consider the system for the regime of larger direct interaction coupling , i.e. , @xmath119 .      for @xmath118 ,",
    "one of the defects disappears from the system , like in the four - dimensional case , see @xcite , while the scalar function of the remaining defect tends asymptotically to the respective value given in ( [ exotic ] ) .",
    "the space - time then becomes asymptotically anti - de - sitter with an effective _ negative _ cosmological constant which reads : @xmath120 in our system , for @xmath118 and @xmath121 , the global monopole disappears since this minimises the energy , consequently it corresponds to the system analysed in @xcite , in which gravity - localising solutions of a thooft - polyakov monopole in seven dimensions have been studied . in the following , we shall discuss the system studied here in comparison to that given in @xcite .",
    "the metric functions of the gravity - localising solutions read @xcite : @xmath122 with the constants @xmath123 and @xmath124 that can be computed directly from ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) ( with @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 gravity localising solutions exist only for positive roots in @xmath127 and @xmath128 , i.e. , we use only the solutions of ( [ coeff ] ) with the plus sign .    for the gauge and higgs field functions , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , we linearize the equations ( [ higgseq ] ) and ( [ gaugeeq ] ) for @xmath91 with @xmath131 neglecting terms of order @xmath132 and @xmath133",
    ", we obtain : @xmath134 then setting @xmath135 and @xmath136 , we find @xmath137 these results agree with the ones in @xcite for @xmath104 , i.e. no direct interaction between the local and global sector and/or @xmath81 , i.e. a pure local monopole .    for @xmath138 and @xmath139 tending to finite values",
    "asymptotically , we have to require @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "since for gravity - localising solutions @xmath142 , we can only choose the solutions with the plus signs in ( [ parameters ] ) . then @xmath143 and with ( [ coeff ] )",
    "a relation between the couplings of the theory can be found . however , this is not one unique solution , but a domain of solutions ( see also below the `` results '' section ) .      for the numerical construction of the solutions , we have to impose boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary conditions for the functions at the origin are equivalent to the ones given in ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) .",
    "however , the boundary conditions at infinity ( [ bc3 ] ) are now replaced by : @xmath144 note that the boundary conditions ( [ bcinfty ] ) are the ones chosen in @xcite such that depending on the choice of @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath117 the higgs and goldstone fields tend to their respective minimum values .",
    "we have not performed explicit numerical calculations here , since our system of equations for @xmath147 and the non - vanishing functions @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath148 ( with coupling constants @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath145 ) is exactly equivalent to the one in @xcite , if we define @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "detailed numerical calculations have been given there and we do not want to repeat them here . however , we would like to point out the relation of the coupling constants of our theory to the coupling constants given previously . in @xcite",
    "it was found that gravity - localising solutions exist only in a specific parameter domain in the @xmath153-domain .",
    "one solution found with negative bulk cosmological constant has values @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 . in our case , fixing @xmath145 , @xmath157 and @xmath150 , @xmath84 and @xmath146 become functions of @xmath117 and @xmath108 .",
    "the contour plots are given in fig.[fig4 ] and fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "= 9.0 cm +    = 9.0 cm +",
    "in this paper , we have studied a 7-dimensional brane world model with a composite monopole residing in the three dimensional transverse submanifold .",
    "we have considered a ricci - flat 3-brane to be at the defect s core .",
    "our analysis reveals that the geometrical structure of the three dimensional submanifold depends crucially on the parameter associated with the direct interaction between the local and the global sector of the theory . for small direct interaction",
    ", we found that qualitatively the system behaves asymptotically like the global monopole system representing a space - time with solid angle deficit in the transverse submanifold .",
    "the presence of the local magnetic monopole modifies the behavior of the metric functions only close to the defect s core .    for large direct interaction ,",
    "the global monopole naturally disappears from the system and leaves behind an effective negative cosmological constant .",
    "the system thus corresponds to a local monopole brane world scenario with negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "then , gravity localising solutions are possible without the a priori introduction of a bulk cosmological constant . in this context",
    "we were able to show that by a convenient redefinition of the matter fields and dimensionless coordinate that the present system is equivalent to the one previously analysed in @xcite , consequently no explicit numerical calculations are needed .",
