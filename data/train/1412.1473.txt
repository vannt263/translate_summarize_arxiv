    "how very young ( age of a few myr ) , massive ( rich ) star clusters ( hereafter vymcs as coined by @xcite ; also known as `` starburst '' clusters ) of near - spherical shape form out of vast molecular clouds is one of the most debated topic in astrophysics .",
    "the most massive ones are typically found in an overall near - spherical core - halo form and they can be surrounded by a cocoon of hii ( ionized hydrogen ) region . perhaps the most widely discussed among such systems are the r136 cluster in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the central cluster ( hd 97950 ; hereafter hd97950 ) of the galactic `` giant nebula '' ngc 3603 and the arches cluster @xcite .",
    "several vymcs are found as the richest member of extended cluster complexes / stellar associations , _",
    "e.g. _ , the onc @xcite .",
    "young stellar systems are also found as extended associations of ob stars , _",
    "e.g. _ , the cygnus ob2 @xcite .",
    "the highly compact young cluster rcw 38 is a special case which is mostly embedded in molecular hydrogen except its central region @xcite . in several cases there are indications that even an overall core - halo shaped vymc also contains substructures , as obtained from the `` massive young star - forming complex study in infrared and x - ray '' ( mystix ; @xcite ) survey catalog @xcite .    at present , there exist apparently at least two distinct scenarios for formation of vymcs .",
    "the monolithic or episodic ( top - down ) scenario dictates the formation of a compact star cluster in an essentially single but highly active star - formation episode .",
    "the infant cluster of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) and main sequence ( ms ) stars remains embedded in its parent molecular gas cloud where the latter gets energized ( and ionized ) by the radiation and material outflows from the stars .",
    "such energy injection eventually causes the embedding gas to become gravitationally unbound from the system and disperse in a timescale typically comparable to the dynamical time of the stellar system , _",
    "i.e. _ , too fast for the stars to adjust with the corresponding reduction of potential well .",
    "this causes the gas - free stellar system to expand violently and lose a fraction of its stars depending on its initial mass and concentration @xcite .",
    "the remaining system may eventually regain virial or dynamical equilibrium ( re - virialization ) ; hence a particular vymc may or may not be in dynamical equilibrium depending on the time taken to re - virialize and the epoch at which it is observed @xcite .",
    "such a `` monolithic '' or top - down scenario has successfully explained well observed vymcs , _",
    "e.g. _ , onc ( also the pleiades ; @xcite ) , r136 @xcite and the ngc 3603 young cluster @xcite .",
    "alternatively , vymcs are thought to have formed `` bottom - up '' via merging of less massive subclusters @xcite .",
    "these subclusters are usually thought to form with high local star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , _ i.e. _ , they convert a large fraction of the gas in their vicinity into stars .",
    "several of such subclusters fall onto each other and merge to form the final vymc .",
    "the gravitational potential of the background molecular gas within which these subclusters appear augments the infall rate ( the so - called `` conveyer belt mechanism '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observational motivation for such a scenario is the apparent substructures in ob associations and even in vymcs having overall core - halo configurations @xcite . on the theoretical side , star formation has been investigated in hydrodynamic calculations involving development of seed turbulence , in cubical / spherical gas clouds , into high - density filaments where star ( sink particle ) formation occurs as a result of gravitational collapse and fragmentation @xcite .    in such calculations , small clusters of proto - stars are formed in filaments and/or filament nodes over a short period of time , which then fall collectively into the potential of the cloud to form larger ( gas - embedded ) clusters ( _ e.g. _ , in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "different groups have reached the state - of - the - art of such calculations by incorporating physical processes in different degrees of detail but for mass scales much lighter than vymcs .",
    "such smoothed - particle - hydrodynamic ( sph ) self - star - forming calculations , requiring very high particle resolution , is formidable for the mass range of vymcs ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "high - resolution ( reaching the `` opacity limit '' ) sph computations have so far been done forming stars in spherical gas clouds of up to @xmath4 only @xcite but without any feedback and hence self - regulation mechanism .",
    "radiation - magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) calculations including stellar feedback ( radiation and matter outflows ) to the star - forming gas have also been carried out from proto - stellar scales @xcite up to @xmath5 gas spheres @xcite . while the latter studies provide insights into the self - regulation mechanisms in the star formation process and point to an sfe near @xmath6% , consistently with observations @xcite , the processes that lead to the ultimate dispersal of the residual gas are still unclear ( matthew bate , university of exeter , u.k . :",
    "private communication ) .",
    "more recently , an independent semi - analytical study @xcite of formation of clump - cores ( that would eventually turn into proto - stars ) in gas clumps and of the maximum mass of the cores infers an upper limit of @xmath7% for the clump sfe .",
    "this is consistent with the hydrodynamic calculations with self - regulation and observations in the solar neighborhood ( see above ) .",
    "note that the gas has to disperse from the region in the molecular cloud where the cluster ultimately assembles , to obtain a gas - free young cluster like what we see today .",
    "the only way the essential dynamical effects of gas dispersal can be included is to adopt a time - varying background potential mimicking the effect of the gas , which is widely used @xcite .",
    "the latter approach has successfully explained several well observed vymcs , _ viz .",
    "_ , the galactic onc @xcite and ngc 3603 @xcite and r136 @xcite of the lmc .",
    "these studies point to a universal sfe of @xmath8% and a sonic dispersal of the residual ionized hydrogen or hii gas ( see @xcite and references therein ) , remarkably reproducing the measured kinematic and structural properties of these clusters .",
    "the dynamical process of coalescence of subclusters into more massive clusters has also been studied recently using direct n - body calculations in both absence @xcite and presence @xcite of a background gas potential .",
    "the role of this process is also investigated in the context of formation of dwarf galaxies through merger of young massive clusters @xcite .",
    "the work reported in the present paper focuses on formation of vymcs through subcluster merging .",
    "in particular , we consider the reproducibility of the vymc hd97950 in the galactic ngc 3603 star forming region from a wide range of initially subclustered conditions . as in @xcite , we target this cluster again due to the availability of its detailed , high - quality structural and kinematical data from the very large telescope ( vlt ; @xcite ) and the hubble space telescope ( hst ; @xcite ) . situated on the carina spiral arm of the milky way at a distance of @xmath9 kpc from the sun , hd97950 is our nearest starburst cluster and also perhaps the most well observed one . furthermore , its large mass ( photometrically @xmath10 ; @xcite ) , extreme young age of @xmath11 myr with a small age spread @xcite despite having a clear core - halo configuration makes hd97950 ideal for testing theories of vymc / globular cluster formation . fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc3603_hst ] shows an hst image of hd97950 .",
    "table  [ tab : hd9795 ] summarizes the observed properties of hd97950 which will be referred to in the following sections at different occasions .",
    "we explore a wide range of initial subclustering mode and the spatial volume over which the subclusters are distributed .",
    "we also explore the effects of the presence of a background gas potential .",
    "we demonstrate that prompt merging of subclusters that fall onto each other from close initial separations ( @xmath12 ) followed by a substantial gas expulsion ( @xmath13% by mass ) can reproduce the observed surface density profile of the hd97950 cluster .",
    "these calculations also suggest that a significant amount of gas expulsion is essential for getting the observed profile right .",
    "nevertheless , the overall agreement with both the structural and kinematic data of the cluster is better achieved with the monolithic model of @xcite than the hierarchical formation models as computed here .",
    "in the following sections we detail our calculations that aim to form the observed hd97950 cluster through subcluster merging , starting from a range of initial configurations .",
    "we also discriminate the cases where the subclusters fall in under the influence of a background gas potential and those where the infall occurs only under the mutual gravity of the subclusters .",
    "the objective is to determine the timescales for formation of core - halo configurations beginning from various substructured initial conditions vis - a - vis the present age of hd97950 .",
    "we also determine the conditions under which the final core - halo cluster agrees with the observed profile and kinematics of hd97950 .",
    "the substructured initial conditions are generated by distributing compact plummer spheres @xcite uniformly over a spherical volume of radius @xmath14 .",
    "the total stellar mass distributed in this way is always the lower photometric mass estimate of @xmath15 for hd97950 .",
    "one motivation for adopting the lower mass limit is the study of @xcite where a monolithic embedded cluster of the above total stellar mass turns out to be optimal in reproducing the hd97950 cluster after gas expulsion . as we will see below ,",
    "this is true in this case also .",
    "the above fashion of initial subclustering is an idealization and extrapolation of what is found in the largest sph calculations of cluster formation to date @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the uniformly dense and turbulent gas spheres develop multiple high - density filamentary structures ( as what is observed in molecular clouds ) where typically 1 - 2 subclusters appear per filament at their densest points and also at the filament junctions .",
    "this is consistent with what is observed in dense molecular gas filaments , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the _ herschel _ telescope @xcite .",
    "these filaments often extend across the spherical cloud and can have arbitrarily bent configuration so that subclusters can appear anywhere within the sphere . also , most of the filaments and the subclusters are found to form promptly .",
    "hence , although the total gas mass used in these sph calculations are about an order of magnitude smaller than the above @xmath16 and the total mass of proto - stars formed is up to 20% of the gas mass @xcite , the above mode of subclustering is an idealized but appropriate extension of the state - of - the - art hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "the plummer shape of the subclusters also conform with the observed plummer profile of the filament sections in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "we choose the half - mass radii , @xmath17 , of these plummer spheres to be typically between @xmath18 pc , in accordance with the observed widths of these highly compact molecular - cloud filaments @xcite .",
    "such compact sizes of the subclusters are also consistent with those observed in stellar complexes , _",
    "e.g. _ , the taurus - auriga stellar groups @xcite .",
    "however , in some calculations , we also use larger @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "the number of subclusters , @xmath19 , over which the @xmath15 is subdivided has to be chosen somewhat arbitrarily ( as in recent studies , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in the above",
    "mentioned hydrodynamic calculations , subclusters containing 10s to 100s of proto - stars ( sink particles ) could form ( subject to the caveat that sink particle formation continues unhindered by stellar feedback ) .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to extrapolate the richness of subclusters to the much larger masses as in here . in order to incorporate a range of possibilities , we consider two primary cases of the initial subdivision of the total stellar mass .",
    "the `` blobby '' ( type a ) systems consist of 10 subclusters of @xmath20 each .",
    "panels 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 of fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps_0myr ] are examples of such initial systems .",
    "note that in this and all the subsequent figures , the panels are numbered left - to - right , top - to - bottom . on the other hand ,",
    "`` grainy '' ( type b ) systems comprise @xmath21 subclusters with mass range @xmath22 summing up to @xmath15 .",
    "we show below that the mode of initial subdivision does not influence the primary results .    the initial spanning radius , @xmath14 ,",
    "is chosen over a wide range , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath23 , to explore the wide range of molecular cloud densities ( see below ) and spatial extents as observed in star - forming regions and stellar complexes . tables  [ tab : morphevol ] and [ tab : kfit1 ] ( their first and second columns ) provide a complete list of the initial conditions for the computations here .",
    "the detailed nomenclature , in their first columns , is explained in table  [ tab : morphevol ] and the corresponding short names , in their second columns , are self - explanatory .",
    "the stellar mass function of the individual subclusters is taken to be canonical @xcite and is drawn from a probability distribution without an upper bound .",
    "note that the stellar entities here are proto - stars which are yet to reach their hydrogen - burning main sequences ( a few most massive members can become ms during their infall depending on the infall time ) .",
    "furthermore , the interplay between gas accretion and dynamical processes ( ejections , mergers ) during the infall and the final assembly of the main cluster continue to shape the global stellar mass function or the initial mass function ( imf ) of the final cluster @xcite . this imf is often observed to be canonical for vymcs .",
    "note that the accretion and the dynamical processes only influence the massive tail of the imf and also sets the maximum stellar mass @xcite of the _ final _ cluster , as indicated in hydrodynamic calculations @xcite .",
    "the overall canonical form of the imf as determined by the low mass stars , which contribute to most of the stellar mass of a subcluster ( @xmath24% ) , appears mostly due to gravitational fragmentation alone .",
    "this justifies our adopting of the unconditional canonical imf as a suitable representation of the proto - stellar mass function of the subclusters , despite the exclusion of gas accretion in the calculations here .",
    "again , the proto - stellar mass function does not critically impact the primary results here .",
    "finally , all subclusters are initially at rest w.r.t . the centre of mass ( com ) of the stellar system .",
    "while this initial condition is again an idealization , it is consistent with the results of detailed hydrodynamic computations . in these calculations , the newly formed subclusters in the high - density filaments and at",
    "the filament junctions typically move with velocities which are much smaller than the average turbulent velocity of the gas cloud and hence form a sub - virial system of subclusters ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "as long as the initial system of clusters is sub - virial , the timescales inferred from the calculations here would not be affected significantly .",
    "primordial binaries are currently excluded for the ease of computing .",
    "the presence of primordial binaries does not affect the subcluster merging process substantially as found in test calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ mrgcls ] ) .      the dense residual molecular cloud , within which the proto - stars form in distinct subclusters ( see sec .  [ initstar ] ) ,",
    "is represented by a background , external gravitational potential of a plummer mass distribution . in this way the overall dynamical effect of the molecular cloud is included . in order to compare with the previous studies @xcite",
    ", we adopt a local sfe of @xmath25 .",
    "such sfe is also consistent with those obtained from hydrodynamic calculations including self - regulation @xcite and as well with observations of embedded systems in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "hence , we place the geometric / density centre of the plummer gas sphere co - incident with the com of the initial stellar system and take the half - mass radius of the former equal to the initial span @xmath14 of the subclusters ( see sec .",
    "[ initstar ] ) . to achieve a local ( cluster - scale ) sfe of @xmath25 , the total gas mass within @xmath14",
    "is taken to be @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the total matter ( gas + stars ) within the @xmath14-sphere is @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath14 is equal to the half - mass radius of the plummer gas sphere , the total mass of the spherical gas cloud is @xmath28 and , including the stars , the entire system contains @xmath29 of matter . in principle",
    ", star clusters can also appear beyond the half - mass radius of the gas cloud although the probability of forming them within is higher because of the higher average gas density there .",
    "hence , the above initial setup is again an idealization to set the intended sfe .",
    "it is also consistent with the uniform initial distribution of the subclusters within @xmath14 since the density is nearly uniform within the plummer half - mass radius .",
    "note that although the sfe is @xmath30% within @xmath14 , it is @xmath31% for entire gas cloud .",
    "these numbers are consistent with what is found in the recent hydrodynamic calculations ( see secs .  [ intro ] and [ initstar ] ) of star formation and are also consistent with observations @xcite .    inserting our adopted value @xmath32 ( see sec .",
    "[ initstar ] ) , we get a total of @xmath33 ( gas + stars ) within @xmath14 .",
    "this gives an onc - like @xmath34 gas density for @xmath35 and @xmath36th of this for @xmath37 which is appropriate for , _",
    "e.g. _ , the taurus - auriga complex of subclusters .",
    "the analytic plummer gas cloud is geometrically static but its total mass is reduced exponentially to mimic gas expulsion as in @xcite .",
    "we use this treatment to be able to compare the present calculations with the previous ones . dynamical gas expulsion in sph - based calculations",
    "have shown this treatment to yield well comparable results @xcite .",
    "note that the spherically symmetric gas expulsion from beyond @xmath14 ( which has a total mass of @xmath26 ) will not influence the stellar system within @xmath14 since the former fraction of gas imparts zero gravitational force within @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the expulsion of the entire @xmath28 plummer sphere has essentially the same dynamical effect on the stellar system as the expulsion of just the @xmath26 gas ( which is appropriate for @xmath38% sfe ) from within @xmath14 .",
    "we address some additional issues in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "the above initial configurations ( see table  [ tab : morphevol ] & [ tab : kfit1 ] ) are generated using a self - developed automated script .",
    "its final outcome is the combined masses , positions and velocities for all the stars in all subclusters for a particular configuration .",
    "the script uses the mcluster code @xcite to generate the individual plummer spheres .",
    "we evolve the above initial configurations using the state - of - the - art direct n - body integrator nbody6 @xcite .",
    "the initial configuration data can be directly fed to the nbody6 code . the spherically symmetric background gas potential ( see sec .  [ initgas ] ) can also be initiated and varied over time from within the n - body code .",
    "nbody6 is a highly sophisticated n - body integrator which uses a fourth - order hermite scheme and particle - specific time steps to compute the trajectories of the individual mass points .",
    "the diverging gravitational force between two close - passing masses or that between the components of a close binary or a multiplet is handled using two- and few - body regularization @xcite .",
    "nbody6 includes the widely - used semi - analytic binary evolution scheme bse @xcite to evolve the individual stars starting from their main sequence .",
    "however , bse does not include a reliable pms evolution .",
    "hence , in the nbody6 calculations here , we do not activate the stellar evolution .",
    "however , we do a few test calculations with the main sequence evolution to qualitatively assess any effect of stellar winds . since we are primarily interested in the configurations at very young ages when the most massive stars are still on their main sequence , stellar wind mass loss would not severely influence the massive stellar spectrum and the associated dynamical consequences .      the generic evolution of a given configuration consists of three parts , _ viz .",
    "_ , ( a ) the net infall of each subcluster towards the global minimum of the gravitational potential well of the system , ( b ) the two - body relaxation of each subcluster while they fall in and ( c ) the final coalescence of the subclusters to approach a system in dynamical ( virial ) equilibrium . the global potential minimum of the system roughly corresponds to the system s com .",
    "the background plummer gas potential ( see sec .  [ initgas ] ) , if present , is the dominant component of the global potential well .",
    "the infalling subclusters eventually merge and form a ( near ) spherical core - halo stellar distribution which is in dynamical equilibrium . during the infall and the merger process , the potential well of the system changes with time but the final virialized stellar distribution and the global minimum of the final potential well must be concentric for an energetically stable configuration .",
    "the final virialized stellar distribution has also much smaller spatial extent than their initial extent @xmath14 ( see below ) .",
    "the timescale in which the system arrives at the smooth - profiled , single cluster configuration is primarily determined by the initial span , @xmath14 , of the subclusters .",
    "@xmath14 determines the time taken for the subclusters to cross their orbital pericenters ( or fall through the potential minimum for strictly radial orbits ) .",
    "the background gas potential , of course , accelerates the initial infall .",
    "starting from rest , as in the present case ( see sec .",
    "[ initstar ] ) , the subclusters pericenters are typically close to the potential minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ , they populate a small central region .",
    "this causes most subclusters to pass through each other nearly simultaneously ( or in a few lots ) . during this phase and in subsequent passages , the subclusters orbital kinetic energy ( k.e . )",
    "is dissipated into the orbital energy of the individual stars via two - body energy exchange among the latter .",
    "this causes the subclusters orbits to sink towards the potential minimum ( typically in a few orbits ) where most of the stellar orbits confine forming an initially irregular and substructured stellar distribution .",
    "the redistribution of the stellar orbits of this stellar system drives it towards its lowest energy configuration ( the `` violent relaxation '' process ) causing its morphology to become increasingly spherically symmetric and the substructures to vanish .",
    "the infall and the initial merger processes occur in the dynamical time of the subclusters falling in the global potential well .",
    "as the newly merged system smoothes out and approaches dynamical equilibrium , the redistribution proceeds with the dynamical timescale of its stellar orbits .",
    "the subclusters infall time , @xmath39 , nevertheless serves as a lower limit of their merger time .",

    "notably , @xmath39 estimates only the _ time of the first arrival _ of the subclusters at their pericenters .",
    "as discussed above , the time taken to merge the subclusters into a single cluster in virial equilibrium can be substantially longer than @xmath39 .",
    "this additional time , in which the subclusters orbit collapse towards the global potential minimum and the resulting stellar system eventually arrives at a featureless ( near ) spherically symmetric configuration ( see above ) , can be referred to as the systemic violent relaxation time , @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath48 also scales with @xmath14 since increasing @xmath14 increases the amount of the subclusters orbital energy , which needs to be dissipated ( see above ) .",
    "this orbit - shrinkage phase of the subclusters and hence @xmath48 is too complicated to estimate analytically since the energy exchange process significantly deforms the subclusters from spherical symmetry and hence complicates the exchange itself . a direct n - body computation , as we do here with nbody6 ( see above ) ,",

    "[ fig : vprofs_gp ] here and fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the gas ( potential ) of the same mass @xmath26 is much more spread out over the length scale @xmath111 in the present case than in @xcite where the gas follows the highly compact pre - gas - release cluster profile ( see above ) .",
    "hence , the latter is subjected to significantly more central mass loss than the present pre - gas - release clusters .",
    "the above discussion implies that the combination of the physically motivated initial conditions adopted here optimally reproduces the observed mass density profile of hd97950 .",
    "the primary objective of the calculations described in the previous sections is to find initial conditions under which it is feasible to assemble a vymc like the hd97950 from an initial distribution of subclusters , given the mass and age constraints for this cluster .",
    "the key inferences can be summarized as follows :    * a system of subclusters of total stellar mass @xmath15 assemble into a ( near ) spherical core - halo star cluster by the age of hd97950 ( _ i.e. _ , in @xmath93 myr ) provided these subclusters are largely born over a region of scale length more compact than @xmath90 pc .",
    "this can happen , _",
    "e.g. _ , in an intense starburst event at a dense `` spot '' in a molecular cloud . *",
    "the initial sizes of the subclusters are constrained by the highly compact sections of molecular gas filaments or filament junctions which , in turn , determines the compactness of the final assembled cluster .",
    "the size of the final cluster is also independent of the presence of residual molecular gas .",
    "therefore , the mass density over the central region ( within a virial radius ) of the merged cluster is determined by the total stellar mass that is involved in its assembly . * a `` dry '' merger of subclusters , _",
    "i.e. _ , infall in absence of residual molecular gas ( all gas consumed into stars ) always leads to a star cluster that is centrally overdense w.r.t .",
    "hd97950 , even for the latter s lower mass limit @xmath15 .",
    "this is irrespective of the initial mode of subclustering .",
    "the expansion of the final cluster due to stellar winds and primordial binaries is insufficient , as indicated by the present calculations . *",
    "a substantial residual gas expulsion ( @xmath112% ) occurring after the formation of the merged cluster expands the latter to obtain a cluster profile that is consistent with the observed hd97950 . with the lower stellar mass limit @xmath15 and an sfe of @xmath113% , the observed surface mass density profile of hd97950 can be fairly and optimally reproduced",
    "although the central velocity dispersion falls short by @xmath114 . * in principle , with more extended initial subclusters it is possible to obtain a merged profile that agrees with that observed for hd97950 , without any gas dispersal ( _ i.e. _ , via dry mergers ) .",
    "however , the resulting central velocity dispersion would then be even lower than the observed value .",
    "much extended subclusters are as well inconsistent with the highly compact widths of molecular gas filaments . * hence , _ the ngc 3603 young cluster ( hd97950 ) has formed essentially monolithically followed by a substantial gas dispersal .",
    "the initial monolithic stellar distribution has either formed in situ or has been assembled promptly ( in @xmath2 myr ) from closely packed ( within @xmath3 pc ) less massive stellar clusters ( subclusters ) .",
    "both scenarios are consistent with the formation of hd97950 s entire stellar population in a single starburst of very small duration . _",
    "the in - situ scenario @xcite seems to better reproduce the observed properties of hd97950 .",
    "a key concern in the above conclusion is that such closely packed gas - embedded subclusters are _ usually _ not seen in practice .",
    "this further supports the in - situ formation of young massive clusters .",
    "however , this does not rule out the prompt assembly channel either .",
    "the initial closely packed subcluster distribution has a very short lifetime and it merges to a single ( embedded ) core - halo structure in a fraction of a myr . hence such systems should be rare to observe .",
    "notably , recent multi - wavelength observations of the pismis 24 cluster of ngc 6357 @xcite indicate that this young cluster ( age 1 - 3 myr ) contains distinct substructures which must have formed out of dense gas clumps packed within @xmath11 pc radius . using the mystix survey catalog",
    ", @xcite also find that the stellar distribution in young clusters ( 1 - 3 myr ) tend to smoothen out with age and local stellar density .",
    "this indicates an appearance of these systems as closely packed stellar overdensities which disappear on a dynamical timescale as seen in the calculations described in the above sections .    also , the requirement of substantial ( @xmath112% by mass ) gas expulsion is supported by the lack of gas in young and intermediate - aged clusters .",
    "in particular , a recent survey of the lmc s massive star clusters over wide ranges of mass ( @xmath1 ) and age ( 30 - 300 myr ) has failed to identify reserved gas in any of these clusters @xcite .",
    "these clusters would have accreted enough surrounding gas by now for the latter to be detected inside them .",
    "this implies that star clusters can , in fact , disperse their gaseous component efficiently at any age @xmath115 myr and irrespective of their escape velocities @xcite .",
    "the primary simplification in the above study is the analytic treatment of the residual gas that forms a spherically symmetric smooth plummer profile ( see sec .",
    "[ initgas ] ) .",
    "the gas consumption by the star formation process in the vicinity of the individual subclusters would imprint a `` swiss - cake '' structure in the spatial distribution of the density of the residual gas .",
    "furthermore , the residual gas cloud could still develop filamentary overdensity structures across it .",
    "hence an infalling subcluster is susceptible to tidal shocks that accelerate its disruption .",
    "this detail is not critical for the present conclusions since the tidal field due to the background smoothed gas potential already disrupts the subclusters significantly during their infall , as seen in the above calculations .",
    "it is rather surprising that despite the wide variety of initial conditions ( _ c.f .  _",
    "table  [ tab : kfit2 ] ) and the simplistic treatment of gas expulsion , the density profile of hd97950 is reproduced naturally in each case .",
    "this is as well true for the in - situ model of @xcite .",
    "as explained there , this implies that the analytic formulation aptly describes the bulk dispersal of the residual gas .",
    "the complex details of matter - radiation interaction and localized processes ( _ e.g. _ , turbulence , instabilities and outflows ) seemingly do not affect the release of the bulk of the gas from the system . that the dynamic expulsion of gas , as modelled using the sph method , reproduces",
    "the here - used analytical time variation has indeed been demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "the use of initially spherical subclusters ( with or without the gas potential ) is also an idealization since a newly hatched group of stars would preferentially follow its local gas overdensity pattern .",
    "however , the stellar assembly would become spherical ( ellipsoidal in presence of gas potential ) in a few of its dynamical times . for a stellar assembly as compact as the gas filaments , its internal dynamical time is typically much shorter than that of its infall .",
    "this effectively reduces a more realistic system to the idealized initial condition adopted here . for a sufficiently small initial span ( _ e.g. _ , for the smallest @xmath14 used here ; _ c.f .  _",
    "panels 2 & 3 of fig .",
    "[ fig : snaps_0myr ] ) , the two timescales are comparable and the whole system can be considered to approach spherical symmetry ( and dynamical equilibrium ) in a single dynamical timescale . in that case",
    "the geometry of the individual subclusters does not play a role .",
    "it is also possible that the individual subclusters collect a substantial fraction of the residual molecular gas during their migration towards the global potential minimum .",
    "additionally , gas can be streamed towards the global potential minimum .",
    "such cooling flows become efficient if the gas is sufficiently cold . in that event",
    "the assembled system will have the gas following the stellar distribution closely unlike the present case ( see sec .",
    "[ mrgexp ] ) .",
    "hence the system reduces to a monolithic `` initial '' condition as in @xcite for which there exists a solution that matches well with hd97950 @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "@xmath88 myr is considered as a `` deadline '' for cluster formation ( see above ) since the focus here is on the formation of hd97950 .",
    "the zero age is the beginning of the dynamical evolution ( or of the n - body calculations ) , which corresponds to the epoch of the formation of the subclusters in a single starburst .",
    "the concurrent appearance of subclusters , _",
    "i.e. _ , a single starburst of very small or zero age spread giving rise to a subclustered configuration , is plausible only in a sufficiently compact region .",
    "the more extended the star - bursting region is ( _ i.e. _ , the larger is @xmath14 ) , a correlation is necessary over larger distances which makes such an event increasingly less probable .",
    "hence , the prompt assembly or the compact in - situ formation are consistent with both the inferred young age and the very small age spread of hd97950 .",
    "note that @xmath88 myr does not represent any fundamental deadline ; it is used here to narrow down the initial conditions .",
    "the present calculations imply that although vymcs can form as highly substructured ( or fractal ) stellar distributions , they still undergo a much more compact ( and hence dense ) phase than their present - day state .",
    "hence , an initial primordial binary population would be substantially more dynamically processed @xcite than what has been suggested recently by @xcite , since the computed systems in the latter study do not necessarily go through a dense enough phase .",
    "a straightforward leap in the present line of study is to conduct a more thorough survey of the merger time as a function of @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath116 , irrespective of any deadline .",
    "it is as well necessary to quantitatively relate the structure of the final cluster with these parameters and also with the sizes of the initial subclusters .",
    "such a survey would be applicable to vymcs in general .",
    "the detail of such modelling can be improved in future by introducing pms evolution recipes and primordial binaries .",
    "another important improvement would be to do a detailed structural analysis of the final merged system .",
    "in particular , the construction of adaptive surface density maps , as in @xcite , can be applied to the computed merged systems .",
    "this would determine their sphericity accurately or reveal if they still contain substructures at a given age . by comparing with the density patterns of observed vymcs as in @xcite",
    ", it would be possible to constrain the initial conditions of these vymcs .",
    "in this context , it would be worthwhile to obtain such density contours for the observed hd97950 cluster as well in order to determine whether it harbours substructures .",
    "this would further constrain the conditions at its birth .",
    "it is currently technologically formidable to form the subclusters from ab - initio hydrodynamic calculations for the present mass scale ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , in the foreseeable future , it would be possible to treat the residual gas hydrodynamically that can be energized by an appropriately modelled stellar feedback .",
    "this is possible to achieve by , _",
    "e.g. _ , using the `` amuse '' framework @xcite . in this way the gas expulsion process can be treated in a more realistic but technologically accessible manner ( simon portegies zwart ; private communications ) .",
    "the timescale of the dispersal would , of course , depend on the modelling of the stellar feedback .",
    "the above discussions imply that although simplifications and idealizations are adopted in the present study , they do not alter the key conclusions and their interrelations as enlisted above , namely , that the evidence points towards vymcs such as hd97950 , r136 , the onc and the pleiades having formed essentially monolithically with substantial gas expulsion .",

    "<S> the stellar radiative and mechanical feedback to the residual gas energizes the latter until it escapes the system . </S>",
    "<S> the newly born gas - free young cluster eventually readjusts with the corresponding mass loss . based on the observed substructured morphologies of many young stellar associations , </S>",
    "<S> it is alternatively suggested that even the smooth - profiled massive clusters are also assembled from migrating less massive subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> a very young ( age @xmath0 1 myr ) , massive ( @xmath1 ) star cluster like the galactic ngc 3603 young cluster ( hd 97950 ) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing between the above `` monolithic '' and `` hierarchical '' formation scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> a recent study by banerjee and kroupa ( 2014 ) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario remarkably reproduces the hd 97950 cluster . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , its shape , internal motion and the mass distribution of stars are found to follow naturally and consistently from a single model calculation undergoing @xmath070% by mass gas dispersal . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> these subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of spatial volumes and have various modes of sub - clustering in both absence and presence of a background gas potential . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the above monolithic initial system that reproduces hd 97950 very well , the same is found to be prohibitive with hierarchical assembly alone ( with / without a gas potential ) . only those systems which assemble promptly into a single cluster ( in @xmath2 myr ) from a close separation ( all within @xmath3 pc ) </S>",
    "<S> could match the observed density profile of hd 97950 after a similar gas removal . </S>",
    "<S> these results therefore suggest that the ngc 3603 young cluster has formed essentially monolithically , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , either in - situ or via a prompt assembly , followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion . both scenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread of this cluster </S>",
    "<S> . future observations of molecular cloud filaments with _ alma _ and proper motion measurements of young clusters with </S>",
    "<S> _ gaia _ will provide more direct tests of such birth environments .    </S>",
