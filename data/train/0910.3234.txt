    "outflows are ubiquitous among agn @xcite , and are observed from radio @xcite , through x - rays @xcite .",
    "these outflows provide the feedback necessary to regulate the growth of galaxies and the m vs. @xmath6 relation @xcite .",
    "the origin of the outflows seem to be radio ejecta from the funnel of the accretion disks and/or accretion disk winds @xcite .",
    "but in order to trigger the nuclear activity and produce the resulting outflows it is first necessary to feed the nuclear supermassive black hole ( hereafter smbh ) .",
    "inflows are , nevertheless , seldom observed . where should we look for them ?",
    "in @xcite we have shown that in hst optical images of early - type agns and a matched sample on non - agn , nuclear filaments or spirals are present in all agn but in less than a third of the non - agn , suggesting that such strucutures map channels which feed the smbh in active nuclei .",
    "in order to look for kinematic signatures of inflows along the nuclear spirals , my group began a project to map the gas kinematics in the inner few hundred pc of nearby agn .",
    "we have used the integral field spectrographs available at the gemini telescopes , namely the integral field unit of the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ifu ) , in the optical , and the near - infrared integral field specgtrograph ( nifs ) in the near - infrared .    _",
    "* optical observations . *",
    "_ in @xcite we have used the gmos ifu to observe the inner 7@xmath7 of ngc1097 , along the galaxy major axis , in the spectral region @xmath8 . we have obtained the gaseous kinematics in the emission lines of h@xmath9+[nii]@xmath10 .",
    "after sutracting the velocity field of a circular disk model from the data , we found non - circular motions in association with a nuclear spiral , revealing streaming motions towards the center with velocities of @xmath1150kms@xmath3 .",
    "in @xcite we showed a similar result for the galaxy ngc6951 , and calculated a mass inflow rate in ionized gas of @xmath12m@xmath2yr@xmath3 . coincidentally , this is about the mass accretion rate necessary to feed the smbh in these low - luminosity agn .",
    "most probably , the total mass inflow is dominated by non - emitting neutral and molecular gas and we are just seeing the ionized `` skin '' of the actual flow .",
    "we have tried to look for inflows in higher luminosity agn , but in these cases the kinematics is dominated by outflows ( see below ) .",
    "we have recently found circumnuclear gas inflow in m81 , another low - luminosity agn , for which we were able to measure the stellar kinematics and have subtracted it from the gas kinematics .",
    "the results were residuals in the form of blueshifts of up to @xmath13kms@xmath3 in the far side of the galaxy and redshifts in the near side , revealing streaming motions of the gas towards the center along the minor axis of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "2.1213@xmath14 m emission - line profile of the nuclear region of the seyfert galaxy ngc4051 , revealing inflows towards the nucleus .",
    "the numbers at bottom left of each panel show the central velocities after subtraction of the systemic velocity . from @xcite . ]    _ * near - infrared observations . *",
    "_ we have found inflows in the near - infrared in nifs observations of the inner @xmath11300pc of the active galaxy ngc4051 @xcite .",
    "these inflows were observed in channel maps along the h@xmath152.1213@xmath14 m emission - line profile .",
    "blueshifts are observed in the far side of the galaxy , while redshifts are observed in the near side , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . if the gas is in the plane of the galaxy , this kinematics means inflows towards the center .",
    "we have calculated the mass inflow rate in the molecular gas , and found low values , which corresponds to only @xmath16% of the mass accretion rate .",
    "much more gas is necessary in order to feed the smbh what leads us to the conclusion that we are observing again only the `` hot skin '' of the molecular gas flow .",
    "estimated values for the ratio of cold to hot molecular gas mass in the nuclear region of agn host galaxies range from 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in nifs observations of ngc4151 @xcite and in mrk1066 @xcite we found molecular gas rotating around the nucleus in compact disks , which may be fuelling the accretion disk inside .",
    "_ * optical observations . * _ we have used gmos - ifu observations to map both the stellar and gas kinematics of 6 nearby seyfert galaxies @xcite . we have used the calcium triplet at @xmath198500  to map the stellar kinematics and the [ siii]@xmath209069  emission line to map the gas kinematics .",
    "the stellar kinematics is dominated by circular rotation , while the gas kinematics  as measured from the centroid of the emission - line profiles  shows both circular rotation and outflows of @xmath11200kms@xmath3 .",
    "we found that the gas emission is not restricted to outflowing region , and the gas which is not outflowing shows circular rotation similar to that of the stars , which favors an origin for this gas in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "it can thus be concluded that , the agn ionizing radiation escapes to regions beyond the narrow - line region ( nlr ) and in the equatorial plane of the outflow , indicating that the obscuring torus is probably clumpy , as suggested by recent models @xcite .",
    "the outflows are in most cases associated with jets and blobs observed in radio images , when available , suggesting that at least in our sample the nlr outflow is produced by radio jets pushing the circumnuclear ambient gas .",
    "this is supported also by the values estimated for the mass outflow rate , in the range 10@xmath21 m@xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "these values are @xmath1110 times the accretion rate to feed the smbh , indicating that the origin of the nlr gas is not the agn itselft but is ambient gas entrained by an agn outflow .",
    "the kinetic power of the outflow is @xmath22 times the bolometric luminosity .",
    "channel maps along the [ siii ] emission - line profile show that the highest velocity gas is observed at the nucleus , contrary to results of a few previous studies for other galaxies which suggest that there is acceleration along the nlr .    _ * near - infrared observations . * _ we have mapped outflows in the near - infrared using nifs @xcite and the ifu of the gemini near - infrared spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the main results of these studies are similar to those obtained in the optical : ( 1 ) ionized gas emission is not restricted to the nlr ; ( 2 ) the gas in the nlr is outflowing , with centroid velocities of a few hundred kms@xmath3 , and is usually correlated with structures observed in radio maps ; ( 3 ) the gas which is not outflowing is in the plane of the galaxy and is usually observed all around the nucleus , indicating escape of ionizing radiation from the agn even at the base of the outflow ; ( 4 ) channel maps usually show high velocities at the nucleus , and do not support acceleration along the nlr .",
    "this can be observed , for example , in channel maps of the nuclear region of ngc4151 , shown in the paper by simes lopes et al . in these proceedings .",
