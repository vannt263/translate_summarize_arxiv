    "in the past decade , the most significant progress made in the qcd description of hadronic physics is perhaps in the avenue of heavy quark dynamics .",
    "the analysis of heavy hadron structures has been tremendously simplified by heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) proposed by isgur and wise @xcite and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) developed from qcd in terms of @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "hqs predicts that all the heavy to heavy mesonic decay form factors in the infinite heavy quark mass limit are reduced to a single universal isgur - wise function , while hqet provides a systematic framework for studying of the symmetry - breaking @xmath0 corrections ( for a review , see @xcite ) . applying hqs and hqet to heavy baryons",
    "leads to similar simplifications to heavy baryon structures @xcite .",
    "also , combining with chiral perturbation theory , one can construct a chiral lagrangian for the low - energy interaction of heavy hadrons with goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "moreover , in terms of heavy quark expansion , hqet offers a new framework to systematically study the inclusive decays of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "however , the general properties of heavy hadrons , namely their decay constants , transition form factors and structure functions etc . , are still uncalculable within qcd , even in the infinite quark mass limit with the utilization of hqs and hqet .",
    "indeed , hqs itself is unable to determine the explicit form of the isgur - wise function and it does not and can not provide a direct description of nonperturbative qcd dynamics to other heavy hadron properties .",
    "the lattice qcd simulations @xcite permit a nonperturbative approach to solve the nonperturbative qcd problem , but so far a direct calculation with the @xmath1-quark is still not possible due to the difficulty of placing heavy particles on the lattice .",
    "very recently an alternative attempt in this regard has been carried out from light - front qcd@xcite but further investigations are needed to obtain reliable results .",
    "hence , although hqs and hqet have simplified very much the heavy quark dynamics , a complete first - principles qcd description of heavy hadrons is still lacking due to the unknown nonperturbative qcd dynamics .    in most studies ,",
    "the heavy hadron decay constants and transition form factors are usually evaluated using various phenomenological models , such as the constituent quark model @xcite , the mit bag model@xcite , qcd sum rule @xcite , and the light - front quark model @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and the mit bag model have been widely used in the phenomenological discussion of hadronic structures . however , the application of these two models is trustworthy only for the processes with small momentum transfer .",
    "the problem may be overcome by the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite which has been considered as one of the best effective relativistic quark models in the description of the exclusive heavy hadron decays @xcite .",
    "its simple expression , relativistic structure and predictive power have made wide applications of the lfqm in exploring and predicting the intrinsic heavy hadron dynamics .",
    "however , theoretical justification of such a model within the framework of qcd has not been addressed in the literature .",
    "in fact , the phenomenological lfqm is also largely limited in its applications , due mainly to the quark model assumptions and its non - manifestation of covariance as a relativistic description .",
    "for example , it has been emphasized in the literature that various hadronic form factors calculated in the lfqm should be extracted only from the plus component of the corresponding currents because of the dynamical dependence of other components .",
    "also , the lfqm calculations for decay processes are restricted only with the zero momentum transfer . as a result ,",
    "one often picks up a specific lorentz frame to perform such light - front calculations .",
    "these computations can lead to the correct results only if the covariance is precisely preserved within the lfqm formulation .",
    "we have recently attempted to calculate the decay form factors over the whole range of momentum transfer , and realized that the so - called z - diagram ( a higher fock state contribution beyond the lfqm ) must be incorporated in order to maintain the covariance @xcite . however , with such an extension , the simplicity of the lfqm is lost . without including the z - diagram contribution , the heavy hadronic form factors calculated directly in the lfqm over the whole range of momentum transfer will explicitly break relativistic covariance @xcite .",
    "thus , the current approach to extract hadronic form factors in the lfqm formulation by choosing a specific lorentz frame and then calculating a particular component ( the plus component ) of the associated current matrix element may not be unique and may cause some inconsistent and even misleading results .    to resolve the above - mentioned problems in the lfqm and to improve the current understanding of the qcd analysis of heavy hadrons , we construct in this paper a covariant light - front model .",
    "this model consists of a heavy meson bound state in the heavy quark limit , which is phenomenological in nature at the present time but is fully consistent with hqs , plus a reliable approach from this bound state to systematically calculate the @xmath0 corrections within hqet in terms of the @xmath0 expansion of the fundamental qcd theory .",
    "we expect that this covariant model fully based on hqs and hqet can serve as a partially phenomenological ( the bound states in the hqs limit ) and partially fundamental ( the @xmath0 corrections in qcd ) description of heavy mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we will provide in sec .",
    "ii a general construction of light - front bound states within hqet . to have a consistent light - front description of heavy hadrons , we begin with an explicit boost covariant expression of meson light - front bound states which can be further expressed in a covariant form in the heavy quark limit .",
    "we show from the light - front bound state equation that such bound states obey hqs . with the covariant",
    "bound states in the heavy quark limit , we can further develop a systematical approach to calculate the @xmath0 corrections to the heavy meson energy splitting , decay constants and transition form factors within hqet .",
    "this will provide a reliable first - principles qcd analysis of the @xmath0 contributions to heavy hadron dynamics .",
    "for a consistent check , we evaluate in the sec .",
    "iii the isgur - wise function @xmath2 in a complete covariant way so that no specific lorentz frame has to be pre - fixed , and it is not necessary to only calculate the plus component of the current in matrix elements .",
    "we can straightforwardly show that in the covariant model the isgur - wise function is renormalized to unity at the zero - recoil point without using the detailed form of the wavefunction , as predicted by hqs .",
    "the general result of the isgur - wise function is found as a universal function of heavy meson decays .",
    "we also evaluate the heavy hadron decay constants @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the heavy quark limit in a covariant way .",
    "again , a consistent result with hqs is obtained .    in sec .",
    "iv we further examine the covariant requirement for the light - front wave functions and calculate the isgur - wise function and decay constants . in sec .",
    "v we evaluate for the first time the heavy mesons mass splitting in the covariant model .",
    "we can see that the covariant light - front model has overcome the theoretical difficulties encountered in the conventional light - front formulation for heavy hadrons , removed the ambiguities in previous calculations , largely simplified the procedure of the non - covariant light - front formulation currently used in the literature , and further provided a first - principles qcd analysis of the @xmath0 corrections within hqet .",
    "the general form of the phenomenological light - front hadronic bound states that are currently employed in the literature has a similar structure as those in the constituent quark model and preserves a fully relativistic description .",
    "hence these states are often called the relativistic quark model or the light - front quark model .",
    "however , almost all the previous investigations have not carefully treated the lorentz structure of these bound states and paid enough attention to the consistency with heavy quark symmetry and heavy quark effective theory .",
    "as it is well known , a great advantage of the light - front bound states , which offer a fully relativistic description , is the simply manifested boost transformation in these bound states . to correctly describe the heavy quark dynamics",
    ", one should also ensure that the light - front description can reproduce all the results associated with hqs . also , to accurately extract the heavy hadron form factors , the covariant problem of the light - front description of heavy hadron bound states",
    "must be considered . furthermore , incorporating hqet with the phenomenological bound states in the heavy quark limit to analyze the @xmath0 correlations is strongly desired .",
    "these are the main issues we shall address in the development of our covariant model .        in principle",
    ", the above light - front wave functions can be dynamically determined from the truncated light - front bound state equation @xcite ( which is similar to the bethe - salpeter equation in the usual equal - time frame ) : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hadron mass , @xmath25 is the so - called ( boost ) invariant mass obtained from the free energies of the constituents in hadrons @xcite , and @xmath26 denotes an effective two - body interaction kernel .",
    "note that by  truncating \" the fock space to only the valence quark states , the dominant contribution of higher fock space to the bound states is described effectively by @xmath26 .",
    "such an effective two - body interaction on the light - front can be derived directly from qcd , for example , by the use of the light - front similarity renormalization group approach developed recently @xcite .",
    "the spin part in the above bound state can be simply constructed in terms of the lorentz structure of the pseudoscalcar and vector mesons : @xmath51 and @xmath52 whose momentum structures are @xmath53 proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , where the imaginary number @xmath56 and the minus sign are introduced by a suitable choice of the phase factor to the pseudoscalar and vector meson bound states , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are spinors for the heavy quark and light antiquark , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the polarization vector of the vector meson .",
    "then the normalized @xmath53 is given by @xmath61 this result is indeed the heavy quark limit of the melosh transformation given in eq.([lfwf ] ) .",
    "the space part @xmath62 ( called the light - front wave function ) in eq.([hqslfb ] ) is the heavy quark limit of @xmath63 in ( [ lfwf ] ) rescaled by a factor @xmath64 .",
    "the normalization of the heavy meson bound states in the heavy quark limit is then given by @xmath65 which leads to the following wave function normalization condition : @xmath66      in principle the heavy quark dynamics is completely described by hqet , which is given by the @xmath0 expansion of the heavy quark qcd lagrangian : @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the heavy meson bound state , eq .",
    "( [ hqslfb ] ) , in the heavy quark limit is then determined by the leading lagrangian @xmath73 in the above @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "quantizing @xmath73 on the light - front by letting @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , we can derive the following light - front bound state equation for the heavy meson bound state ( [ hqslfb ] ) : @xmath76 this bound state equation was also derived within the light - front hqet @xcite , where the variable @xmath38 is given by @xmath77 .",
    "the effective heavy - light quark interaction @xmath78 can be obtained from the leading lagrangian of ( [ hqcdl ] ) through the use of the light - front similarity renormalization group approach .",
    "such an effective interaction is independent of the heavy quark s mass and spin . in other words , @xmath79 respects hqs . for a detailed derivation ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to prove that the light - front wave functions discussed above possess heavy quark symmetry . using the normalization property of eq .",
    "( [ spin ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ qqbse ] ) can be reduced to @xmath80 where @xmath81,\\ ] ] which is independent of the mass and spin of the heavy quark .",
    "thus , the integral kernel , @xmath82 which determines the wave function @xmath83 , is also independent of the mass and spin of the heavy quark . therefore , the wavefunction @xmath84 must be degenerate for @xmath27 and @xmath85 . as a result , we can simply write @xmath86 in the heavy quark limit . eq .  ( [ hqslfb ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ msiwf ] ) is then the heavy meson light - front bound states in the heavy quark limit that obey hqs .",
    "the above light - front heavy mesonic bound states in the heavy quark limit manifest boost covariance and heavy quark symmetry .",
    "in fact , it can also be rewritten in a fully covariant form if the light - front wave function @xmath87 is a function of @xmath88 ( see the proof given in sec .",
    "iv ) : @xmath89 where the antiquark @xmath90 in bound states is on - mass - shell , @xmath91 .",
    "hence , @xmath92 as we will see later , the widely used gaussian - type wave functions have such a structure in the heavy quark limit .",
    "when the wave function possesses such a form , the heavy meson bound state in the hqs limit , eq .",
    "( [ hqslfb ] ) , can be expressed in a covariant form : @xmath93 where @xmath94 for @xmath27 and @xmath95 for @xmath85 , and @xmath96 here",
    "@xmath97 is the residual momentum of the heavy quark and @xmath98 the momentum of the light antiquark .",
    "note that the energies of physical particles in the above integrals are always positive no matter if they are expressed in terms of the light - front coordinates or the equal - time coordinates .",
    "this is because we have already separated explicitly the particle and antiparticle components in its fourier transformation . on the light - front",
    ", this implies that @xmath99 [ @xmath100 is a light - like unit vector defined as @xmath101 in all the subsequent calculations presented in this paper .",
    "this restriction does not cause any trouble for maintaining the covariance .",
    "the fourier transformation of @xmath102 , @xmath103 leads to eq .",
    "( [ hqslfb ] ) , where the factor @xmath104 in front of the fourier transformation is due to the required normalization of the bound state , eq .",
    "( [ nmc2 ] ) .",
    "now , the normalization condition of eq .",
    "( [ nwf ] ) can be written in a covariant form : @xmath105 the left hand side of the above equation can be easily obtained in a diagrammatic way as shown in fig .  1 : @xmath106 \\nonumber \\\\      & = & { \\rm eq.~(\\ref{cn } ) } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in general , the diagrammatic rule within the covariant model is given as follows :    \\(i ) the heavy meson bound state in the heavy quark limit gives a vertex ( wave function ) as follows : @xmath107 @xmath108 with a momentum conservation factor @xmath109 .",
    "here we do not have the four - momentum conservation since the meson and valence quarks are all on - mass - shell , but this does not affect on the covariant calculations we will perform later .",
    "( ii ) the internal line attached to the bound state gives an on - mass - shell propagator , @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "\\(iii ) for each internal line attached to the bound state , sum over helicity and integrate the internal momentum using @xmath113 for the heavy and light quarks , respectively , where the delta functions come from the on - mass - shell condition .",
    "\\(iv ) for all other lines and vertices that do not attach to the bound states , the diagrammatic rules are the same as the feynman rules in the conventional field theory .",
    "these are the basic rules for the subsequent evaluations in the covariant model .",
    "now we can see that the the heavy meson states in the heavy quark limit consists of a bare heavy quark @xmath114 surrounded by a brown muck denoted by @xmath115 , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the light - front wave function @xmath116 here can be regarded as the effective structure of brown muck resulted from the complicated low - energy interactions of quarks and gluons .",
    "therefore the physical picture of our covariant light - front model is very clear .",
    "once the light - front bound states in the heavy quark limit is constructed , all the results obtained from the above bound states are ensured to be consistent with hqs .",
    "furthermore , from such bound states , we can further develop a systematic approach within hqet to calculate the @xmath0 corrections in the first - principles qcd .      as we have discussed in sec .",
    "ii.b , the heavy meson bound states in the infinite quark mass limit is dynamically determined by the leading lagrangian @xmath73 in the @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "then , the @xmath0 corrections to the bound states can be easily formulated in perturbation theory by taking @xmath117 as a perturbation in hqet .",
    "consider the heavy meson state @xmath118 as a unperturbated state in the light - front time @xmath119 .",
    "the physical state @xmath120 at @xmath121 is then given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a light - front time - ordering operator , and @xmath124 the interaction part of the qcd lagrangian for light quarks .",
    "note that the above light - front time - ordering perturbation expansion can be equivalently expressed in terms of the usual equal time - ordering perturbation expansion since the unperturbated state @xmath125 has a covariant form .",
    "formally , the @xmath0 corrections to physical observables are given as follows .",
    "let the physical observable be @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the leading operator in the @xmath0 expansion , and @xmath128 is the @xmath36-dependent terms in terms of @xmath0 expansion .",

    "v.    as a result , our covariant model for heavy mesons contains the bound state in the heavy quark limit plus a systematic approach to calculate the @xmath0 corrections within hqet .",
    "we expect that this model can serve as a quasi - first - principles qcd description of heavy mesons . in the subsequent sections",
    ", we shall give some basic applications of this covariant model , including the calculation of the isgur - wise function , the decay constants and the heavy meson masses up to the @xmath0 corrections .",

    "the above isgur - wise function is an improvement to that given in @xcite where the calculation is somewhat oversimplified .",
    "we also note that the above result for the isgur - wise function is the same as that extracted from the plus component of @xmath161 transition matrix element at time - like @xmath162 in the non - covariant lfqm @xcite",
    ". however , in our previous work based on the lfqm @xcite , the isgur - wise function extracted from the plus component of @xmath163 matrix element is different in its expression from that for @xmath164 transition .",
    "this indicates that the usual lfqm utilized before is not fully consistent with hqs . in other words , in the usual lfqm description , extracting the hadronic form factors from the plus component of hadronic matrix elements may lead to ambiguities due to lack of lorentz covariance .",

    "for example , with the input @xmath207 we obtain the value of @xmath203 for @xmath200 and @xmath201 listed in table i. we then use these values to calculate the isgur - wise function and its slope @xmath208 at the zero - recoil point ( see table i and fig .  5 ) .    0.5 cm table i. parameter @xmath203 fitted to the decay constant @xmath206 with @xmath209 gev in two different covariant light - front wave functions . also shown",
    "are the results for @xmath210 and the slope @xmath208 of the isgur - wise function at the zero - recoil point .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that , because of the loss of covariance , the bsw wave function fails to give a finite result for @xmath206 .",
    "this reinforces the statement that one can not use a non - covariant light - front wave function in practical applications .    from the above numerical results , we see that both the covariant wave functions @xmath200 and @xmath201 give a reasonable behavior of the isgur - wise function .",
    "quantitatively , different phenomenological wave functions give slightly different results .",
    "to get some insight of which wave function may be more reliable , we have also looked at the light quark mass @xmath211 and @xmath203 dependence of @xmath208 , where @xmath208 has been measured experimentally .",
    "the results show that for both @xmath200 and @xmath201 wave functions , the slope @xmath208 of the isgur - wise function increases with a decrease of the averaged relative momentum @xmath212 , but the response of @xmath208 to @xmath212 is more sensitive for @xmath201 than that for @xmath200 .",
    "furthermore , the current experimental analysis gives @xmath213 @xcite which seems to favor the wave function @xmath200 .",
    "of course , there are many other possible wave functions and the real solution should be determined from eq .",
    "( [ qqbse ] ) which deserves further investigation .",
    "in this section , we present an example , the mass splitting of pseudoscalar and vector mesons , to show how to calculate @xmath0 corrections in our covariant light - front model .    in the heavy quark limit , the heavy meson masses can be written as @xmath214 here @xmath205 is a constant ( independent of @xmath36 ) and is of order @xmath215 and @xmath216 . in principle",
    ", @xmath205 can be directly determined by solving the bound state equation in the heavy quark limit from the leading order lagrangian , namely eq .",
    "( [ qqbse ] ) .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , our covariant model permits a systematic evaluation of various @xmath0 corrections , as we have formulated in sec .",
    "ii . in the infinite quark mass limit ,",
    "the pseudoscalar and vector mesons are degenerate . of course , in reality they are not .",
    "their mass difference comes mainly from the hqs - breaking leading @xmath0 corrections . from sec .",
    "ii , these @xmath0 corrections can be expressed as @xmath217    in the covariant model , @xmath218 and @xmath219 can be diagrammatically depicted as shown in fig .  6 :    as we can see",
    ", @xmath218 is the same for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons , whereas @xmath219 gives rise to the mass splitting between these two states .",
    "hence , we shall only focus on the calculation of @xmath220 . from the diagrammatic rules of the covariant model ,",
    "we can immediately write down the expressions of @xmath220 as follows : @xmath221 and @xmath222 where @xmath223 is a color factor , @xmath224 for @xmath179 , and @xmath225 is the gluon propagator , in feynman gauge , @xmath226 with @xmath227 , and @xmath228 is considered as an effective gluon mass in the low - energy domain of qcd .",
    "in conclusion , we have constructed in this paper a new light - front model for heavy mesons .",
    "the main feature of this model is the preservation of covariance in the lfqm .",
    "we show that the covariant light - front wave function must be subject to the constraint of being a function of @xmath248 . as a result",
    ", we find that the gaussian - type light - front wave function satisfies this constraint but the commonly used bsw wave function does not .",
    "this explains the puzzle encountered in @xcite why we can not get the correct normalization of the isgur - wise function at zero recoil extracted from @xmath249 transition using the bsw wave function .",
    "the covariant model removes some ambiguities often occurred in the usual lfqm calculation due to lack of covariance , releases the restriction of light - front calculations that hadronic form factors can only be extracted from the matrix elements of the plus component of the corresponding heavy quark currents at the zero momentum transfer .",
    "meanwhile , as we have shown in this paper , the covariant model allows us to perform an extremely simple evaluation of various heavy meson properties .",
    "the typical examples given in this paper are the calculations of the isgur - wise function , the decay constants and the heavy - meson mass splitting which is a @xmath0 correction in hqet .",
    "furthermore , we have also proposed a new covariant light - front wave function , eq .",
    "( [ newlfw ] ) , from the residual light - front ( boost ) invariant mass , which gives good numerical results .",
    "further applications to other properties of heavy mesons and physical processes will be presented in subsequent papers .",
    "another significance of the covariant model is that it provides a quasi - first - principles description of the heavy meson dynamics .",
    "namely , although the heavy meson bound state in the heavy quark limit is still phenomenological in nature at present , it is constrained by hqs and hqet . in the meantime , it offers a systematic approach to calculate the @xmath0 corrections based on the first - principles @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "this resembles very much the situation of the qcd analysis of deep inelastic scatterings for light quark systems , in which the low energy dynamics ( described by parton distribution functions ) is determined phenomenologically and perturbative corrections are given in a fully first - principles way .",
    "here the situation may even be better since the phenomenological part is constrained by hqs and hqet , whereas the nonperturbative qcd dynamics should be much simpler in heavy quark limit , as has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "besides many other applications , there are some further development for this covariant light - front model .",
    "one is the extension to heavy baryons .",
    "the other is to solve the bound state equation , ( [ qqbse ] ) , in the heavy quark limit in the low energy hqet .",
    "of course , once this equation is solved , the covariant model constructed in this paper is no longer a model description , it will become a fully qcd description of heavy hadrons .",
    "we shall investigate these problems in the near future .",
