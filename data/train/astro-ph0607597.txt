    "galactic globular clusters , which are ancient building blocks of the halo , represent an interesting family of `` hot '' stellar systems in which some fundamental dynamical processes have taken place on time scales comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "intermediate in mass between galaxies and open clusters , globulars are unique laboratories for learning about two - body relaxation , mass segregation and equipartition of energy , stellar collisions and mergers , and core collapse .",
    "the whole concept of core collapse , linked to the gravothermal instability which may develop due to the negative specific heat of self - gravitating systems , was first investigated theoretically in the 1960s and observed indirectly in the 1980s ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the stellar density in the core may increase by up to six orders of magnitudes during the phases of deep collapse .",
    "this significantly increases the frequency of interactions and collisions between stars .",
    "binary stars play an essential role during these late phases of the dynamical evolution of a globular cluster , as they transfer energy to passing stars and can thus strongly influence the cluster evolution ",
    "enough to delay , halt , and even reverse core collapse . at the same time",
    ", stellar collisions are effective in destroying binaries ( the outcome of most binary - binary interactions being the destruction of one participant ) , in hardening those that remain , and in ejecting stars towards the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "observational evidence of possible products of stellar encounters include blue stragglers , x - ray sources , pulsars , and high - velocity stars .    in their pioneering radial - velocity study of the globular m3 @xmath15 ngc  5272 , @xcite noted the puzzling presence of two stars that they called `` interlopers '' .",
    "these are two high - velocity stars located in the core of the cluster , both about 20  from the centre .",
    "they have radial velocities relative to the cluster mean of + 17.0 km  s@xmath16 and @xmath17 km  s@xmath16 , corresponding to 3.5 and 4.5 times the velocity dispersion in the core .",
    "these radial velocities are still close enough to the mean radial velocity of the cluster ( @xmath18 , high enough to make contamination by field stars very unlikely ) to carry a strong implication of membership .",
    "similarly , @xcite discovered two high - velocity stars in the core of the globular cluster .",
    "located respectively at about 3  and 38  from the centre , they have line - of - sight velocities relative to the cluster of @xmath19 km  s@xmath16  and @xmath20 km  s@xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath21 times the core velocity dispersion but appearing in a total sample of only 50 radial velocities .",
    "repeated observations over 1.5 years indicated that neither of these two stars is a binary or a pulsating star , and high - resolution echelle spectra confirmed their luminosity classes and , consequently , their membership in 47 tucanae .",
    "prompted in 1995 by the presence of these four unusually fast - moving stars in two different globulars , and their potential link to the extreme dynamical processes in high - density environments , we decided to investigate further the core of 47 tucanae , the closest of the two clusters .",
    "the capability limit of the radial velocity observations which could be obtained from the ground in the crowded core of 47 tuc having already been reached , we concluded that if more progress was to be made in the search for high - velocity stars , it had to be made by obtaining proper motions ",
    "a task for which only hst is suitable .",
    "we thus used wfpc2 to obtain images of the core of 47 tucanae , at three different epochs over four years between 19951999 , in order to perform precise astrometry and obtain a complete census of high - velocity stars . choosing the f300w ( @xmath22-band ) filter allowed stars to be measured over the whole color - magnitude diagram , from the red - giant branch to well down the main sequence , ultimately yielding a velocity database of unprecedented size for a globular cluster .",
    "meanwhile , subsequent observations of the center of 47 tuc , by unrelated wfpc2 and acs imaging programs between 19992002 , have provided extremely useful supplements to our original dataset .    in this paper , we present our analysis of these hst data . not surprisingly , we have found it possible to address a number of issues beyond simply characterizing the stellar velocity distribution ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "but the latter does remain our primary focus here , and our look at other questions ( estimating the distance to 47 tuc ; defining the internal velocity - dispersion profile as a function of stellar luminosity / mass ; assessing the possibility of a compact central mass concentration ) is not as comprehensive .",
    "however , we are also providing full details of the data themselves , including extensive tables of star - by - star astrometry , photometry , and proper - motion solutions .",
    "this thorough census of the stellar distribution and kinematics in 47 tuc , used together with sophisticated modeling techniques , will ultimately allow for unique and precise constraints to be placed on relaxation processes , stellar collision and ejection rates , and many other aspects of the dynamical structure and evolution of globular cluster cores .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting that previous studies of internal globular - cluster dynamics using hst - based proper motions @xcite have employed samples of @xmath121000 member stars and tended to focus on deriving the stellar velocity dispersion very near the cluster centers .",
    "the largest sample of ground - based proper motions comes from the analysis by @xcite of 9847 stars in ngc 5139 @xmath15 @xmath23 centauri , using observations over a @xmath1250-year baseline . @xcite",
    "have used a high - quality subset of 2295 of these stars to explore the internal dynamics of this large cluster and estimate a distance to it .",
    "our full velocity sample for 47 tuc includes 14,366 stars , and the majority of these prove useful for a variety of precise kinematics analyses .",
    "we begin in  [ subsec : hstdataoutline ] by giving the basic details of the wfpc2 and acs image sets that we have used to derive proper motions for stars in 47 tuc .",
    "section [ subsec : master ] then focuses on the construction and astrometric calibration of a comprehensive catalogue of positions and f475w magnitudes for nearly 130,000 stars in one central acs field measuring about 3  on a side .",
    "this `` master '' star list is presented in table [ tab : master ] , and both it and an associated image that we have made of the field are available from the online edition of the _",
    "we then use this list to re - evaluate the coordinates of the center of 47 tuc . in  [ subsec : multiepoch ]",
    "we describe our procedures for performing _",
    "local _ coordinate transformations of the data at other epochs into the master reference frame , in order to obtain _ relative _ proper motions for as many stars as possible in a rather smaller area ( @xmath24 ) of the sky .",
    "section [ sec : velsamples ] discusses our derivation of the velocities themselves , focusing on statistical properties such as goodness - of - fit and error distributions in order to identify a useful working sample for kinematics analyses .",

    "this provides a direct extension of a wider - field , ground - based @xmath1-band surface - brightness profile already in the literature . combining these data",
    ", we fit a standard single - mass and isotropic @xcite model to the cluster , to give a rough framework for the physical interpretation of some of our results .",

    "sections [ sec : veldist ] and [ sec : veldisp ] then examine various aspects of the stellar kinematics in the central 5 core radii of 47 tuc .",
    "some preliminary results from earlier stages of this work have been presented in conference proceedings by @xcite and @xcite , which naturally are superseded here .    in   [ subsec : onedvel ] and [ subsec : twodvel ] , we construct the one- and two - dimensional distributions of proper motion and compare them both to gaussians and to @xcite models with finite escape velocities .",
    "we look especially for evidence of stars with total speeds on the plane of the sky exceeding the nominal central escape velocity of 47 tuc , but find only a few dozen potential candidates .",
    "section [ subsec : highpm ] summarizes the overall properties of these high - velocity stars .",
    "in  [ subsec : strag ] we go on to compare the velocity dispersion of blue stragglers in our field to that of similarly bright stars on the cluster s giant branch . section [ subsec : kinmags ] considers the run of velocity dispersion with clustercentric radius , as a function of stellar magnitude , and obtains an estimate of the average velocity anisotropy in the central regions .",
    "section [ subsec : distance ] then compares the velocity dispersion profile of the brighter stars in our proper - motion sample to that of our much smaller radial - velocity sample , to derive a kinematic estimate of the distance to 47 tuc . in  [ subsec : bhmods ]",
    "we focus on the kinematics at the smallest projected radii , to fit the proper - motion velocity dispersions there with models based on those of @xcite but allowing for the possible presence of a dark central point mass .",
    "we should emphasize from the start that , although 47 tuc is known to be rotating @xcite , we do not attempt to include this complication in any of our kinematics analyses . the justification for this is essentially that we are working here only on relatively small scales , in regions of the cluster for which rotation is indeed dynamically dominated to a large extent by random stellar motions .",
    "this point has been made previously by @xcite , and we illustrate it again , quantitatively , in  [ subsec : norotation ] of this paper .    for reference throughout the paper , some basic data on 47 tuc are provided in table [ tab : basic ] . some of the numbers there rely on new analyses of the hst data that we have collected .",
    "note up front the small field contamination predicted by the galaxy model of @xcite , which for the area covered by our proper - motion sample ( very roughly , @xmath494 arcmin@xmath50 ) amounts to of order 3 ( @xmath512 ) interloping field stars brighter than @xmath52 . for the majority of our work",
    ", this is evidently a negligible effect .",
    "this project began with a series of wfpc2 exposures of the center of 47tuc in 1995 , 1997 , and 1999 ( go-5912 , go-6467 , and go-7503 , pi meylan ) .",
    "the goal of these observations was to search for the proper - motion analogues of the high - velocity `` cannonball '' stars that @xcite had found with coravel radial velocities from the ground ( and which have well - known counterparts in the galactic globular cluster m3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these original exposures are confined within the inner @xmath1245 core radii ( @xmath53 ) of the cluster .",
    "they were taken with the f300w ( @xmath54-band ) filter in order to suppress the background from the red giants and thus allow better position measurements of the more numerous stars at the main - sequence turnoff and fainter . as a result , we found it possible to measure accurate motions not only for the fast - moving stars in the cluster , but for many thousands of the average members as well .",
    "furthermore , subsequent ( unrelated ) hst observations of the core of 47 tuc have nearly doubled our original four - year time baseline and allowed the derivation of more precise proper motions .",
    "additional wfpc2 images of the same central field as the meylan pointings were obtained in 1999 and 2001 ( go-8267 and go-9266 , pi gilliland ) through the similarly short - wavelength filter , f336w .",
    "more recently , acs images that cover the same area were obtained in 2002 for various calibration programs ( pis meurer , king , and bohlin ) , all through the slightly redder f475w filter .",
    "we have reduced all of these images from the hst archive and included them in our analysis .",
    "the acs data in particular have proven extremely useful in providing much higher - precision position measurements than are possible with the lower - resolution wf chips of the wfpc2 .",
    "in addition , the even coverage of these acs - wfc data ( as contrasted with the lop - sided wfpc2 footprint ) allows us to construct an accurate , uniform , and nearly complete census of stars  independently of any proper - motion goals  within about @xmath55 arcminutes of the cluster center .",

    "there are 182 independent exposures taken as parts of ten distinct sets , which we refer to loosely as ten `` epochs '' spanning nearly seven years in total .",
    "our general approach to collating these for analysis is first to combine all the exposures for each epoch so that we have a single position and flux for each star measured in a frame natural to that epoch .",
    "this intra - epoch averaging also gives an empirical estimate of the error in position and flux for each star at each epoch .",
    "we then compare the positions of stars measured at the different epochs to derive proper motions .",
    "the proper motions we measure are , of course , simply changes in the relative positions of stars over time .",
    "the many observations are taken at different times , at different pointings and orientations , through different filters , and with different instruments .",
    "each observation therefore has a different ( and a priori unknown ) mapping of the chip coordinates to the sky .",
    "before we can compare relative positions of stars measured in different images , we must transform all our positions into a common reference frame .",
    "we have chosen to use the wfc images of the go-9028 data set to construct this `` master frame , '' since these images have a large and very even spatial coverage .",
    "the large majority of stars found in any of our data sets will be found in the go-9028 data set .",
    "in  [ subsec : master ] , then , we define this master frame and discuss its astrometric and photometric calibration",
    ". we also use it to find a new estimate for the cluster center , which will be useful for our later analyses . after this",
    ", we briefly describe the process by which we transform multi - epoch observations into the reference frame (  [ subsec : multiepoch ] ) . in  [ sec : velsamples ] we detail our derivation of the proper motions themselves and define a working sample for investigation of the cluster kinematics in the rest of the paper .",
    "special care is required in constructing the star list for the reference frame , since even if a star is not optimally measured in the go-9028 data set , we still want to allow for the possibility that it might be found well in other epochs .",
    "our primary goal is therefore to make the master list as complete as possible .",
    "the go-9028 data set has some small dithers and some large dithers about a central pointing .",
    "we do not want the master star list to be affected by the location of the inter - chip gap in the centeral pointing , so we made use only of the central - pointing image and the pointings that had ditherings larger than the inter - chip gap to generate an unbiased master list .",
    "this amounts to 13 images out of the 20 in go-9028 .",
    "we first fit a psf to every peak in each of these 13 images , and then corrected each peak s raw pixel position ( from the _ flt images ) for distortion according to the prescription in anderson ( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "we next determined the transformation from each image into the frame of the central pointing and identified a star wherever a peak at the same master - frame location was found in 7 or more of the 13 individual images .",
    "this gave us a list of 129,733 coincident peaks , covering an area of about 202@xmath56202 , with positions in the distortion - corrected frame of the central - pointing image ( j8cd01a9q ) .",
    "plotting the star list on a stacked image that we made of the field shows that no obvious stars are missing from the list .",
    "there are , however , a ( relatively small ) number of psf artifacts that occurred in the same place in all images and which were therefore misidentified as stars .      in order to isolate psf artifacts in the master list , we went through the list star by star .",
    "for each star we found every fainter neighboring `` star '' within 25 pixels . in figure",
    "[ fig : psfartifacts ] we show the distribution of neighbors for all saturated stars only ( about 3000 altogether ) . on the horizontal axis we plot the distance in wfc pixels from the bright star to the fainter neighbor , and on the vertical axis",
    "we show the magnitude difference .",
    "psf artifacts occupy a clearly recognizable region in this parameter space ( e.g. , the clump of points at a @xmath1210-pixel distance and @xmath128-magnitude flux difference ) .",
    "we therefore define the discriminating line shown in figure [ fig : psfartifacts ] to distinguish real stars from ( possible ) artifacts . for every star in turn in the full master list",
    ", we have flagged all neighbors that fall above this line .",
    "these correspond to objects that are too close to brighter stars to be considered trustworthy , and they should not be used in any detailed analyses .",
    "this procedure is bound to reject some real stars along with true artifacts , but it does so in a quantifiable ( and therefore correctable ) way .",
    "the end result is a more robust and better - defined star list , consisting ultimately of 114,973 reliable stars .",
    "the full star list is presented in ",
    "[ subsubsec : masterlist ] below , after we have described the astrometric and photometric calibration of the data .",
    "the acs / wfc images provide us the widest , the most uniform , and the deepest survey to date of the central regions of 47 tuc .",
    "previous images taken by wfpc2 have a very asymmetric and non - uniform coverage , due to the lop - sided shape of the wfpc2 footprint and the gaps between the chips .",
    "by contrast , the dithered set of wfc images have essentially uniform coverage out to a radius of about 100 , which is nearly five core radii .",
    "these data therefore permit us the best determination to date of the cluster center .",
    "indeed , given the high degree of completeness in the present star counts , it is difficult to imagine any significant improvement in the near future .",
    "note that a determination of the center from star counts should not depend on incompleteness corrections , provided of course that incompleteness is a function only of stellar magnitude and clustercentric radius . nor should mass segregation enter the problem , so long as the stellar distribution is radially symmetric .",
    "thus , in determining the center we work directly with our master star list , making no attempt to correct for either of these effects .",
    "we begin with our list of 114,973 stars after culling faint neighbors ( possible psf artifacts ) . for each star",
    "we have a position @xmath57 in the reference - frame coordinate system , rotated in order to align the @xmath58 axis roughly with north .",
    "next , an array of trial centers @xmath59 is defined , and for each trial center in turn we find all the stars within a radius of 1500 wfc pixels ( 75 ) from that center .",
    "we then divide these stars into sixteen , @xmath60-wide pie wedges  shown schematically in the left panel of figure [ fig : findcena]and use two tests to compare the distributions of stars in the eight distinct pairs of opposing wedges .    in the first test",
    ", we look at the difference in the total number of stars between the members of the opposing - wedge pairs defined by each @xmath59 in our pre - defined array of trial centers , and we form a `` quality - of - fit '' statistic as the sum of the differences over the eight wedge pairs . the coordinates which minimize this statistic then define a `` median '' estimate of the cluster center .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : findcena ] shows a contour plot of the sum of differences for a 3@xmath563  subgrid of trial centers , with @xmath61 corresponding to the best center ultimately implied by this method ( the conversion to calibrated right ascension and declination is discussed below ) .",
    "the second test is to generate the cumulative radial distribution for stars within each of the sixteen wedges for any specified @xmath59 .",
    "we then find the absolute value of the integrated difference between the radial distributions in any two opposing wedges , and define a quality - of - fit statistic as the sum of these absolute differences over the eight wedge pairs .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : findcena ] shows a contour plot of this statistic over a grid of trial centers , with @xmath61 again corresponding to the best - estimate coordinates which minimize the statistic .",

    "this ratio is 1.238 .",
    "the encircled energy curves in the acs handbook @xcite then show that 92.5% of the light should be contained within this radius .",
    "thus , we scaled all our fluxes by a net factor of 1.339 upward and then divided by 60 ( seconds ) before adding the vegamag zeropoint of 26.168 @xcite to obtain a final , calibrated f475w magnitude for each star in the master list .",
    "the broad , uniform coverage of our wfc master frame also makes this a useful data set for constructing an accurate surface density profile for the cluster . we can detect _",
    "almost _ all the stars there are , so it should be possible to come up with the definitive radial profile from the center out to nearly 5 core radii .",
    "there are , however , two issues that complicate the construction of any density profile from star counts in globular clusters : incompleteness and mass segregation .",
    "mass segregation really just means that the density profile can differ , at least in principle , for stars in different mass ( magnitude ) ranges .",
    "it is a physical effect , separate from any instrumentation or data - reduction issues , and we discuss it briefly in  [ sec : space ] below , where we actually derive a density profile for the innermost parts of the cluster .",
    "incompleteness , on the other hand , is a technical limitation of the observations themselves .",
    "incompleteness is always a joint function of both the images and the algorithm used to find stars in the images .",
    "it can arise from several sources .",
    "a particular star might not be found because ( 1 ) it is too close to a brighter neighbor and is not bright enough to generate its own peak in the image ; ( 2 ) it could land on a defect in the chip or it could be hit by a cosmic ray ; or ( 3 ) it could be close to the background and not bright enough to generate a peak above the noise .",
    "the fact that we have generated our list from many observations all at different pointings saves us from ( 2 ) . and",
    "since the stars we analyze in this paper are always several magnitudes brighter than the faintest stars that can be detected in the master frame , issue ( 3 ) is not important for us .",
    "the first source of incompleteness ( bright - star crowding ) is the only thing we need to concern ourselves with here .",
    "the usual strategy for evaluating incompleteness involves applying a set data - reduction procedure to a large number of artificially generated data sets .",
    "this is a rather daunting prospect in our case , and we have instead addressed the problem directly from the algorithm we used in  [ subsubsec : purge ] to identify ( likely ) non - stellar artifacts in our original list of 129,733 psf peaks in the master frame .",
    "first , we used the acs images from program go-9028 to create a circular image of the region @xmath89 , with a uniform pixel size of @xmath90 pixel@xmath16 .",
    "( note that this reference image completely contains the master field itself , which is non - circular and measures only @xmath91 on a side .",
    "this is because we required a point to be covered by at least 7 acs pointings to contribute to the master star list , but only one was sufficient to build the circular mosaic . )",
    "we then went pixel by pixel through the intersection of this circular frame with our master field , made a list of all stars found by our psf - fitting within a 25-pixel ( @xmath92 ) radius from each point , and recorded the faintest magnitude , @xmath93 , of the stars which could have survived the artifact - purging procedure of  [ subsubsec : purge ] and figure [ fig : psfartifacts ] .",
    "this yields an estimate of the limiting magnitude at every pixel in our master frame .",
    "given the limiting @xmath93 at every point in our field , we calculated a `` completeness fraction '' for every star in the master list individually .",
    "knowing the position @xmath94 and magnitude @xmath95 of each star in the list , we looked at the values of @xmath93 at all points within 100 pixels ( @xmath96 ) of @xmath94 and counted the number of pixels for which @xmath97 .",
    "that is , we computed the fraction @xmath98 $ ] of the local area around each star where an identical star could fall but be discounted as unreliable by our criterion in  [ subsubsec : purge ] ( or not be detected at all ) .",
    "the local completeness fraction at @xmath99 is then just @xmath100 .    with @xmath101 defined pointwise in this way",
    ", every star in our master list is interpreted as representing @xmath102 actual stars , and corrected density profiles follow simply from the sums of @xmath102 over all points within specified areas on the sky .",
    "again , we actually construct such a profile in  [ sec : space ] .",
    "as was mentioned just above , as part of our estimation of completeness fractions we constructed a meta - image of the innermost @xmath103 from the center of 47 tuc .",
    "this convenient reference image , 47tucmaster.fits , oriented in the usual north - up , east - left way , is available through the online edition of the _",
    "astrophysical journal_. a low - resolution version of it is shown in figure [ fig : metaimage ] .",
    "table [ tab : master ] finally presents all important information on the 129,733 coincident psf peaks in our master field , which is fully contained in the circular area of the meta - image .",
    "( a sample of table [ tab : master ] can be found at the end of this preprint . )",
    "only 114,973 of these peaks can be said confidently to be bona fide stars , but to be comprehensive , we have here retained ( and flagged ) the 14,760 peaks which could be psf artifacts according to  [ subsubsec : purge ] .",
    "the table gives the offset of each detection from the cluster center in arcseconds ; the calibrated f475w magnitude ; the absolute ra and dec in real and celestial formats ; the faintest magnitude a star at each position could have and still be found ; a flag indicating whether the star survives the artifact purging ; the local completeness fraction for the brightness and position of each star ; a serial i d number ; and @xmath57 coordinates in both our meta - image and the original image of the acs / go-9028 central pointing .",
    "the absolute astrometric calibration of table [ tab : master ] should be good to about 01 , but the relative positions should be much better than this  particularly for bright , unsaturated stars and those with small separations , for which we estimate an accuracy of @xmath120001 .",
    "of course , all the positions refer specifically to the epoch ( 2002.26 ) of the go-9028 data set",
    ".      with a well - defined reference frame in hand , the next step toward deriving proper motions is to measure the positions of stars in individual images taken at different epochs and transform these into the master coordinate system .",
    "we began this task by measuring each star in each data set in table [ tab : datasets ] with an appropriate psf , derived according to the method of @xcite .",
    "for the acs - wfc observations , we used a single psf to treat the entire 2-chip association .",
    "we also used a single psf for the entire acs - hrc chip .",
    "the psf does vary significantly with position over the acs , but our data were reduced before the methods of @xcite were developed to deal with this .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite shows that the biggest effect of this variation on astrometry is a small bias of 0.01 pixel in the positions .",
    "since all our images are well - dithered , this error averages out and is included in the internal uncertainties for the positions .",
    "the constant - psf assumption can also introduce systematic errors of up to 0.03 magnitudes in the photometry , but this is not of concern to us here .",
    "all the raw measured positions were corrected for distortion using the prescriptions in @xcite for wfpc2 data and anderson ( 2006 , in preparation ) for acs data .",
    "these corrections include the global and fine - scale distortion corrections , as well as a correction for the 68th - row defect .",
    "charge - transfer inefficiency should not be an issue , as the background is relatively high in the images that we have used .",
    "it was then necessary to combine all the observations of each star in the multiple pointings at each epoch . in all cases we adopted the centermost pointing as the `` fiducial '' frame for each epoch , and used general 6-parameter linear transformations ( along the lines of those described in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : transform ] ] below ) to transform positions from the individual , distortion - corrected pointings for that epoch into the central frame . in finding these transformations for wfpc2 images",
    ", we treated the pc chip and the three wf chips independently of the others ; for the acs images , the hrc chip and two wf chips were likewise considered independently . in this way , we found an average position for each star in each of 27 chip - epoch combinations .",
    "the standard deviation of a star s position in the independent pointings at each epoch defines the uncertainty in @xmath104 and @xmath58 locations .    at this point",
    "we examined the errors in the stars positions as a function of their flux at each epoch in order to define a criterion to define which stars were well measured and which were not well measured within each data set .",
    "figure [ fig : magcuts ] shows a plot of the position errors as a function of the instrumental magnitude @xmath105 $ ] for some sample chip - epoch combinations .",
    "we drew the fiducial lines shown in figure [ fig : magcuts ] to distinguish well measured from poorly measured stars ; only stars falling below these lines in any of the data sets were retained for any further analysis . in addition to this , we discarded all stars found within the pyramid - affected region of any of the wfpc2 chips ( ie . , any at chip coordinates @xmath106 or @xmath107 ) .",
    "we finally rejected any saturated bright stars from the star list for every data set .",
    "this left us with an average position , including uncertainties , and a flux for every star that we deemed well measured in each chip of each data set .",
    "the positions were still in the distortion - corrected coordinate systems of the individual epochs , however , and needed next to be transformed into the system defined by our master frame .",
    "we should note explicitly here that the go-9028 wfc data ( epoch 2002.26 ) were subjected to the above analyses ( and to the coordinate transformations described next ) in exactly the same way as were any of the other epochs in table [ tab : datasets]even though the master frame in ",
    "[ subsec : master ] was itself defined using data from this epoch .",
    "this is because in constructing the master frame we used only 13 images from the 2002.26 wfc set of 20 and made no effort to impose any `` quality control '' on the stellar positions or magnitudes .",
    "however , any given star in the master list could , in principle , be observed in one or more of the seven other pointings at this epoch ; or alternately its position might be so poorly constrained ( relative to the criterion illustrated in figure [ fig : magcuts ] ) that it is not useful for proper - motion measurements .",
    "thus , to make optimal use of the go-9028 wfc data requires that they be re - analyzed in parallel with the other epochs , with the master frame viewed simply as an externally imposed construct .",
    "the transformation into our master coordinate system is non - trivial .",
    "given the small proper - motion dispersion in 47 tuc ( see table [ tab : basic ] ) and our short ( @xmath108 year ) time baseline , we need to resolve displacements of order 0001 and less for the stars in our sample .",
    "the pointing of hst is good to only 01 at best , however , and thus we can not transform our positions to an absolute frame with anywhere near the accuracy required .    the only information we have about how the coordinate system of one frame is related to that of any other comes from the positions of stars that are common to both frames .",
    "each observation typically has thousands of stars in common with the master frame .",
    "once these stars are matched up , the two sets of positions can be used to define a linear transformation from one coordinate system to the other .",
    "specifically , if we have a list of positions @xmath109 for @xmath110 stars at some epoch , and a list @xmath111 for the same stars in the master frame , then we specify @xmath112 for constants",
    "@xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath59 , @xmath117 to be determined",
    ". it may look like there are eight free parameters in this transformation , but in fact we have the freedom to pick the zeropoint offset in one system . in particular , if we choose ( @xmath118,@xmath119 ) to be the centroid of the @xmath110 matched stars in the non - master frame , then ( @xmath120,@xmath121 ) is necessarily the centroid of the group in the master system . with these set ,",
    "then , standard least - squares regression can be applied to solve for the linear terms @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 from the @xmath122 observed pairs of coordinates .",
    "our last concern is the question of how many stars should be used to do this .",
    "if we were to use _ all _ the stars in common between the master system and the data from any other epoch , the solution of equation ( [ eq : transform ] ) would correspond to the best global transformation between the two coordinate systems .",
    "unfortunately , such a chip - wide solution may not give the best transformation for a given point .",
    "in particular , although all of our frames have been distortion - corrected , any residual distortions will introduce systematic errors in a global transformation .",
    "such distortion errors tend to be cumulative , i.e. , they are larger for stars that are farther apart . as a result",
    ", the distance between two nearby stars can be measured much more accurately than the distance between stars at different corners of a chip .",
    "we therefore decided to perform more local transformations , using smaller groups of relatively nearby stars to define different transformations at different positions in an observed frame .",
    "such a scheme may sound computer intensive , but it is straightforward enough to implement and is not , in fact , exceedingly slow . given that we will never be able to remove distortion perfectly ,",
    "this is a useful way to minimize its effect on our results .",
    "two sources of error influence the choice of the number @xmath123 of stars to use in solving the system of equations ( [ eq : transform ] ) for local transformations .",
    "first , the positions @xmath124 and @xmath125 themselves are obviously subject to some uncertainty . if @xmath126 denotes a representative value of this uncertainty , then the average transformation is fundamentally uncertain at a level @xmath127 , which suggests that we would like @xmath123 to be as large as possible .",
    "second , the uncorrected residual distortion introduces appreciable systematic error if the `` nearby '' stars used to define the local transformation at any point come from too far away .",
    "this implies that we would like @xmath123 to be as small as possible .",
    "after some experimentation , we found that a reasonable compromise between these opposing tendencies was reached with @xmath128 for our data . in practice",
    ", we took a single star from the list of well - measured positions at one epoch ; found this target star s nearest 55 neighbors ; and matched these neighbors to positions in the master frame .",
    "we then used these 55 pairs of coordinates ( _ not _ including the target star itself ) to solve for the coefficients in equation ( [ eq : transform ] ) ; discarded the 10 stars which deviated most from the solution ; and re - solved for the transformation using the 45 remaining stars .",
    "this was then used to transform the original , target star _ only _ into the reference frame .",
    "these steps were repeated for every well - measured star in the combined frame for each of our ten epochs , until we had measurements of ra and dec position ( relative to the cluster center ) vs.  time for all stars in a single , unified coordinate system .",
    "we also performed this procedure using @xmath129 and @xmath130 and did not find significant differences , in general , from our results with @xmath128 .",
    "however , the lower number is approaching the limit of what we feel comfortable with in terms of vulnerability to small - number statistics , while the higher number is coming close to bringing in too - distant neighbors that could well be affected by uncorrected distortion errors .",
    "there is another , somewhat more subtle source of error in our local transformations , which comes from the fact that all the stars are physically moving with respect to each other from one epoch to the next .",
    "thus , even if a star s position could be measured perfectly in every image , it is impossible to associate its location @xmath57 at some epoch perfectly with its position @xmath131 in the master frame using a finite network of @xmath123 moving neighbors . put another way , any one network of neighbor stars might in fact have a real net motion relative to the cluster center , but our approach assumes that all such network motions are identically zero .",
    "this error gets averaged away over many networks , of course , so that the mean velocity we estimate for any group of stars will be unbiased .",
    "however , any estimate of the velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , _ is _ affected .",
    "details of how we correct for this are given in appendix [ sec : errcor ] , which also discusses the correction of velocity dispersion for unequal measurement errors .",
    "here we simply note that the net effect of the local - transformation error is an artificial inflation of the intrinsic stellar @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath132 , or about 1.011 for our chosen @xmath128 .",
    "in addition to calibrated f475w photometry for all stars in our master field (  [ subsubsec : photo ] ) , we have obtained calibrated @xmath1-band and f300w ( roughly @xmath0-band ) magnitudes for the subset of stars falling in the wfpc2 field of the original meylan exposures ( go-5912 , go-6467 , go-7503 ; see table [ tab : datasets ] , and note that @xmath1 exposures were also taken as part of these programs for photometric purposes only ) .",
    "as we will describe below , all stars for which we have derived proper motions were required to be detected in at least one of these three early epochs , and thus the full proper - motion sample has multicolor photometry .",
    "although the standard @xmath1 bandpass is not substantially different from f475w , it is useful for relating our analyses to various ground - based observations , and to such things as theoretical stellar mass - luminosity relations .",
    "the shorter @xmath0-band photometry is useful for constructing a color - magnitude diagram of our velocity sample in order to investigate how cmd position might influence stellar kinematics .",
    "@xmath1 photometry of the wfpc2 fields was calibrated against an hrc image of the core of 47 tuc , using the vegamag zeropoints in @xcite .",
    "star - by - star comparison with the calibrated photometry in @xcite shows agreement at the @xmath133-mag level on average .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitudes were calibrated using the vegamag zeropoint in the wfpc2 data handbook @xcite .",
    "the main - sequence turn - off in our @xmath134 cmds agrees well with that in @xcite .",
    "we report the @xmath1 and @xmath0 photometry for our proper - motion stars in  [ subsec : pmsample ] , where we now define the velocity sample .",
    "our multi - epoch astrometry data are most certainly not homogeneous .",
    "the 2002 epoch is relatively uniform , thanks to the even acs / wfc coverage ; but the earlier wfpc2 observations come from a different camera with different pointings , dithering patterns , fields of view , and resolutions . thus , not every star in any one of the ten data sets of table [ tab : datasets ] can be found in all of the other nine .",
    "in  [ subsec : pmsample ] , we describe how we go from a heterogeneous sample of multi - epoch positions to a homogeneous sample of proper motions .",
    "we also examine the quality of the fits of straight lines to the position - vs .- time data , and the uncertainties in the final proper motions . in ",
    "[ subsec : rvsample ] , we discuss the third component of velocity , that along the line of sight . specifically , we have a large sample of ground - based radial velocities for stars in 47 tuc , and we are interested in using these in conjunction with our proper - motion sample to obtain a kinematic estimate of the distance to the cluster (  [ subsec : distance ] ) .      to define a working sample of plane - of - sky velocities for kinematic analyses",
    ", we have chosen to work only with stars which are observed in at least _ three _ separate data sets prior to year 2000 ( i.e. , in three or four of the meylane1 , meylane2 , meylane3 , and gillilu1 epochs in table [ tab : datasets ] ) , _ and _ in at least _ one _ of the acs data sets ( any of the wfc or hrc fields ) from 2002 .",
    "thus , we only derive proper motions for stars that have a _",
    "minimum _ of four separate @xmath135 measurements spanning a _ minimum _ of about 4.4 years ( @xmath136 ) , and all derived velocities are effectively `` tied down '' by a precise acs position measurement . in practice ,",
    "most of our stars are in fact measured 6 or more times over the full 6.7-year timespan ( 1995.822002.56 ) of our epochs , and a good number do in fact appear in all 10 of the data sets listed in table [ tab : datasets ] .",
    "we further decided to include stars in the proper - motion sample only if they also appear in the master star list of  [ subsec : master]even if another acs `` epoch '' might contain the star .",
    "ultimately , this has some effect on the spatial distribution of the velocity sample .",
    "figure [ fig : fields ] shows the ra and dec offsets from our estimated cluster center for a subset of stars in our master list ( the larger , rotated square field ) , and the positions of stars in the original meylan epochs ( the four smaller , more densely filled squares ) .",
    "evidently , the combination of all our requirements gives us proper motions over a patch on the sky with roughly the familiar wfpc2 pattern , but with slightly larger gaps than normal between the chips ( cf .",
    " [ subsec : multiepoch ] ) and with the outermost corners shaved off .",
    "we consider a star to be `` observed '' at any pre-2002 ( wfpc2/meylan or gillil ) epoch only if it is detected in at least _ ten _ of the individual pointings / ditherings that went into that observation , and if it survives the culling based on position error vs.  instrumental flux discussed around figure [ fig : magcuts ] above . for any of the higher - precision , 2002 acs observations ,",
    "we take a star to be detected only if it is identified in at least _ four _ individual pointings / ditherings and if it again survives the appropriate culling by position error .",
    "these criteria are imposed to ensure that , whenever we include the measurement of a star s position at any one epoch in our proper - motion determination , we also have enough information to estimate accurately the position _ uncertainty _ at that epoch .",
    "the estimation of position uncertainties is of critical importance to the derivation of proper - motion uncertainties , and thus to the ultimate inference of intrinsic , error - corrected stellar kinematics . as was suggested in  [ subsec : multiepoch ] , we take a star s position in any epoch to be the mean of the positions measured in the separate ditherings that were combined for that epoch and transformed into the master reference frame .",
    "the uncertainty is then simply the standard sample deviation of those independent multiple measurements .",
    "note that we do _ not _ work with the uncertainty in the mean position ( which would involve dividing the standard deviation by @xmath137 for @xmath138 ditherings ) , because the theory of linear regression  which we use to derive velocities  actually requires that the square of the errorbars on the data be unbiased estimates of the variance in the position measurements .",
    "thus , given @xmath139 positions and uncertainties as functions of time for any star that satisfies the minimum criteria just set out , we derive a plane - of - sky velocity in each direction by a standard , error - weighted least - squares fit of a straight line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* section 15.2 ) , allowing both the slope and the intercept to vary .",
    "this procedure automatically yields uncertainties in each component of velocity . the measurement - error distribution in each component of velocity for any single star will be gaussian , with a mean of zero and a dispersion equal to the fitted least - squares errorbar , _ if _ the position measurement errors are similarly gaussian distributed .",
    "we have assumed that this is the case .",
    "the most important advantage of performing a _ weighted _ least - squares regression here is that it returns a @xmath140 value for each straight - line fit .",
    "knowing the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ( @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the number of independent epochs at which the star s position was measured ) , it is then possible to calculate the probability that the @xmath140 of the fit could have occurred by chance if the true motion of the star were really linear ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we can then make use of this to exercise some quality control over the proper motions , by excluding from kinematics analyses any stars with fitted velocities whose @xmath140 probabilities are lower than some specified threshold .    by fitting straight lines to our position - vs .- time data we are obviously assuming that the stars are moving at effectively constant velocity . to justify this in general , note that the characteristic gravitational acceleration in the core of 47 tuc is of order ( see table 1 , and   [ sec : space ] and [ sec : veldisp ] below ) @xmath143 .",
    "even integrated over 7 years , the velocity change induced by such an acceleration is only @xmath144 mas yr@xmath16 , which is , as we shall see , a small fraction of the velocity uncertainties we infer .",
    "of course , this does not exclude the possibility that some stars could be significantly accelerated by `` nonthermal '' processes such as stellar or black - hole encounters , or by virtue of being in tight , face - on binaries , or in some other way .",
    "such stars will simply not be described well by straight - line motion , and the @xmath140 probabilities inferred from our weighted linear regression will reflect this fact .",
    "thus , a low @xmath145 can reflect legitimately nonlinear data as well as simple `` bad '' measurements .",
    "in all , we have 14,366 stars with ra and dec positions measured to satisfactory precision in at least three pre-2000 epochs and at least one 2002 acs epoch , and with measured @xmath1 and @xmath0 magnitudes ( as described in  [ subsubsec : multiphoto ] ) .",
    "table [ tab : posdata ] , which is published in its entirety in the electronic version of the _ astrophysical journal _ , contains the instantaneous j2000 ra and dec positions in our master frame ( epoch 2002.26 ) for all of these stars , expressed both in arcseconds relative to the cluster center determined in  [ subsubsec : center ] ( see also table 1 ) and in absolute celestial coordinates .",
    "the f475w , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 magnitudes of each star are also reported . the ra and dec offsets ( also in arcsec ) from the nominal master - frame position , and their uncertainties , are then given for every epoch in which the star was detected .",
    "the proper - motion velocities and uncertainties implied by the weighted straight - line fitting to the offsets vs.  time then follow , along with the @xmath140 values for the fits and the probabilities @xmath145 that these values could occur by chance if the motion is truly linear .",
    "we have not tabulated the intercepts of the linear fits , as these only reflect the choice of an arbitrary zeropoint in time and are of no physical interest in the constant - velocity case .",
    "( a sample of table [ tab : posdata ] can be found at the end of this preprint . )",
    "table [ tab : posdata ] includes all stars for which we have estimated velocities , regardless of whether or not the @xmath140 values of the fits have `` good '' probabilities .",
    "we stress again that a reliable sample for kinematics work should exclude stars with very low @xmath145 , but that some such stars could still be of interest for investigations of non  constant - velocity phenomena ( which we do not pursue in this paper ) .",
    "two points should be noted regarding the connection between table [ tab : posdata ] and the larger master list of stars in table [ tab : master ] .",
    "first , at the 2002.26 wfc - meur epoch in table [ tab : posdata ] , the ra and dec offsets from the absolute master - frame positions are consistent with 0 within the uncertainties for most stars , but they do not vanish exactly  even though this is the epoch that was used to construct the master frame .",
    "the reason for this is that the master list in  [ subsec : master ] was defined using a very specific subset of the 20 individual exposures comprising the wfc - meur data set , while the relative positions found in ",
    "[ subsec : multiepoch ] and used here to compute proper motions were allowed to come from different combinations of the 20 pointings . as a result",
    ", the transformations in the latter case can not be expected in general to give positions identical to those in the master list , and the offsets for this epoch in table [ tab : posdata ] essentially reflect statistical noise .",
    "second , there are some stars in table [ tab : posdata ] for which no offset at all is given at the wfc - meur epoch ",
    "an entry of `` n / a '' appears instead  even though all stars in the proper - motion table are guaranteed by construction to appear in the master list . in these cases ,",
    "the uncertainties in the stars positions at the master - frame epoch were larger than acceptable according to our flux - based criterion defined in figure [ fig : magcuts ] above , and thus these data were excluded from our fitting for proper motions .    having derived proper motions for the best - measured stars in our field , we now describe the selection of a velocity subsample which is best suited for kinematics analyses .",
    "in particular , we can be more specific about how the @xmath140 probabilities in table [ tab : posdata ] are used to cull stars with particularly poor proper - motion measurements ( or nonlinear motions ) , and we can quantify the distribution of the velocity uncertainties .",
    "figure [ fig : pmgood ] shows plots of position ( in milliarcseconds of ra and dec offset from the master - frame position ) vs.  time ( in years from the arbitrary zeropoint 1999.20 ) for two stars with relatively good proper - motion determinations . in the left panels is a bright star , near the cluster center , which has position measurements in table [ tab : posdata ] for 8 of our 10 data sets / epochs . in the right panels",

    "the @xmath140 probabilities for the linear fits of the two proper - motion components are also listed , showing that these data are fully consistent , within measurement error , with the basic assumption of constant velocity .",
    "the much smaller position uncertainties in the most recent , acs data relative to the pre-2002 ( wfpc2 ) epochs are noteworthy .",
    "the right - hand panels particularly illustrate how the acs epochs play a crucial role in defining the overall motions of our stars throughout the @xmath127-year baseline of the observations .",
    "indeed , if only the 4-year span of wfpc2 data had been fit to find a proper motion for the faint star in figure [ fig : pmgood ] , the ra component would have had the _ opposite sign _ ( though with a larger errorbar ) from that obtained when the acs data are included .",
    "evidently , relying on only a few epochs of astrometry , even with the hst , can lead to spurious proper motions for some individual stars .",

    "both stars here are fairly bright and near the cluster center , and both show more scatter about the best - fit linear velocity than is acceptable . on the left - hand side ,",
    "the problem is primarily with the ra displacements in the upper panel , where the early ( wfpc2 ) epochs do not match well onto the precise later ( acs ) position measurements and @xmath145 is uncomfortably small . on the right - hand side ,",
    "the scatter in both the ra and dec motions is so large ( relative especially to the small errorbars on the acs positions at year @xmath148 ) that there is effectively no confidence that the best - fit constant velocity is an accurate representation of the data .",
    "plots like those in figures [ fig : pmgood ] and [ fig : pmbad ] can be generated for any star from the data in table [ tab : posdata ] , using an sm macro ( pmdat.mon ) that we have packaged and made available in the online edition of the _",
    "astrophysical journal_. after inspecting many such graphs and comparing the kinematics of samples of stars defined by imposing various lower limits on the allowed value of @xmath145 for the fitted velocities , we eventually decided to include in detailed analyses only stars which have @xmath149 for _ both _ ra and dec components of proper motion .",
    "this criterion defines a velocity sample which cleanly excludes `` bad '' data such as those illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmbad ] ( as well as  again  potentially perfectly good data that are just nonlinear ) and shows quite robust kinematics , in the sense that samples defined by revising the @xmath145 threshold in equation ( [ eq : pchi ] ) moderately upward  even by as much as an order of magnitude  do not have significantly different statistical properties .",
    "figure [ fig : errmua ] shows the distribution of uncertainties ( least - squares errorbars ) in the ra component of proper motion for stars in table [ tab : posdata ] which are brighter than @xmath150 and have @xmath151 for the fitted values of both @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we have divided this subsample into three broad bins of projected clustercentric radius , @xmath5 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that stars at @xmath152 have systematically higher velocity errorbars , typically by factors of @xmath122 , than those at @xmath153 .",
    "this is because this radius is completely contained in the high - resolution , pc chip of the wfpc2 camera ( see figure [ fig : fields ] ) , which affords higher precision in the measurement of ( pre-2002 ) stellar positions than the wf chips which cover the larger radii in our field . from this alone",
    "it is clear that our velocity uncertainties correlate with clustercentric position .",
    "panels on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : errmua ] plot the proper - motion uncertainty @xmath154 against the velocity itself , @xmath146 .",
    "the colored lines , which correspond to different magnitude bins within each radial bin , connect the median @xmath154 errorbar in each of a number of discrete @xmath146 bins .",
    "the right - hand panels then show the corresponding normalized histogram of velocity uncertainties in each radius / magnitude bin .",
    "these show that , for stars of a given magnitude , the distribution of @xmath154 not only peaks at smaller values for @xmath153 , but it is more _ sharply _ peaked there as well . put another way , stars at the larger clustercentric radii have a stronger tail toward high velocity errorbars .",
    "conversely  and quite naturally  at any fixed clustercentric radius , fainter stars always have larger average uncertainties and broader distributions .",
    "indeed , the stars in the faintest magnitude bin illustrated here ( @xmath155 ) have , at radii @xmath156 , `` typical '' velocity errorbars of order 0.6 mas yr@xmath16 or more , which is comparable to the intrinsic velocity dispersion at the center of 47 tuc ( table [ tab : basic ] ) .",
    "thus , stars of such faint magnitude will be of limited use for the statistical characterization of intrinsic cluster kinematics .",
    "stars that are fainter still have even larger velocity uncertainties and are entirely useless in this context .",
    "thus , we impose the magnitude limit @xmath157 when choosing stars for any kinematics analysis .",
    "this is _ not _ to say that the velocities of individual faint stars are always unreliable  we shall see evidence to the contrary in ",
    "[ subsec : highpm]but only that their group properties are poorly constrained .",
    "the distribution of velocity uncertainties for the dec component of motion , @xmath147 , is essentially identical , in all respects , to that shown for the ra component in figure [ fig : errmua ] .",
    "the basic message of these plots is that , due to strong correlations with stellar magnitude and position , the errorbars on our fitted velocities cover a wide range of values and can not be considered even approximately equal . nor ,",
    "in general , are they negligible relative to the intrinsic stellar motions .",
    "it is therefore important to account properly for the effects of measurement error on the observed proper - motion distribution and its moments ( i.e. , velocity dispersion ) .",
    "the details of this are discussed in appendix [ sec : errcor ] , where we also consider the statistical implications of the local - transformation approach to obtaining relative proper motions ( cf .  ",
    "[ subsubsec : local ] ) .",

[ [ eq : pchi ] ] and [ [ eq : maglim ] ] ) and a sample in the right - hand panels that we exclude from such work ( i.e. , which consists of stars with @xmath158 in either component of proper - motion velocity , and/or with magnitude @xmath159 ) .",
    "the cmd of the upper left - hand panel exhibits a very well defined cluster sequence , including a red giant branch , a main - sequence turn - off at about the appropriate @xmath32 ( table [ tab : basic ] ) , and even a small blue - straggler population .",
    "this is , in fact , not unexpected given that the foreground contamination in our small field ( with an area of @xmath494 arcmin@xmath160 ) is expected to amount to perhaps @xmath161 brighter than @xmath162 ( from the foreground star density estimated by @xcite ; see see table [ tab : basic ] ) .",
    "note that we have no stars brighter than @xmath163 with measured velocities at all .",
    "such stars were generally saturated in the 2002 acs frames , and thus did not meet our selection criteria for the proper - motion sample",
    ".    the rejected stars in the right - hand panels of figure [ fig : cmdpos ] amount to only @xmath164 of the full sample in table [ tab : posdata ] .",
    "30% of them ( 417/1392 ) are rejected simply because they are fainter than @xmath165 .",
    "the 975 others are rejected solely because they have a low @xmath140 probability for the linear fit to one or both components of their velocity . of these , as figure [ fig : cmdpos ] suggests , the majority are brighter than @xmath166 and located within @xmath167 of the cluster center , where the stellar density is highest and crowding is most problematic .",
    "it is important to check whether the rejection of these stars leads to significantly different kinematics for the `` good '' proper - motion sample than would have resulted if all stars were retained .",
    "thus , in figure [ fig : goodvbad ] we show the cumulative distributions of ra and dec velocities for stars with @xmath168 and @xmath169 , split into samples with @xmath151 ( accepted into a final kinematics sample ) and @xmath158 ( rejected ) .",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov tests applied to these indicate that the velocity distributions of the rejected stars are consistent with their having been drawn from the same parent distribution as the accepted stars .",
    "thus , excluding the former from analysis does not give biased kinematics in the end but simply reduces the net uncertainty in our final results .    before going on to use our sample of 12,974 good proper motions to investigate these kinematics in detail , we first briefly describe some complementary line - of - sight velocity data that we use in  [ subsec : distance ] ( only ) to derive a kinematic distance to 47 tuc .",
    "the radial velocities used in this study come from two different instruments : the geneva observatory s photoelectric spectrometer coravel @xcite mounted on the 1.5 m danish telescope at cerro la silla , chile , and the rutgers fabry - perot spectrometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at ctio .",
    "details of the coravel data are given by @xcite and @xcite ; typically , the measurements for relatively bright giants and subgiants have uncertainties of @xmath170 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the fabry - perot velocities include some previously published @xcite , and some newly measured ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) from two runs at ctio in 1995 : one using the 1.5-meter telescope on 1622 june 1995 , and one with the 4-meter on 67 july 1995 .",
    "the velocities normally have precisions of 1 km s@xmath16 or better , depending on the stellar magnitude and crowding .",
    "all together , there are nearly 5,600 stars with coravel and/or fabry - perot radial velocities , with fabry - perot contributing a large majority of the data .",
    "however , each of these samples covers a much larger area of 47 tuc than does our proper - motion sample .",
    "we work here only with a much smaller subset of stars which lie within a radial distance of 105  of the cluster center and thus overlap the proper - motion field ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : cmdpos ] ) . in addition",
    ", we found it necessary to exclude from our analysis any fabry - perot stars fainter than the horizontal branch in 47 tuc ( which is also roughly the limiting magnitude of the coravel data ) .",
    "this drastically reduces the sample size and thus requires some explanation .",
    "the basic strategy of fabry - perot observations is described in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to scan an etalon across a strong absorption line ( h@xmath62 in our case ) to build a small spectrum .",
    "the instrumental resolution of the rutgers system is around 5000 , and the fwhm of the h@xmath62 line is larger than this . for the 4-meter observations of 47 tuc , 21 steps across the h@xmath62 line",
    "were used , while the 1.5-meter run observed two fields using 17 and 41 steps .",
    "the full range in all three cases was about 5 .",
    "the exact wavelength coverage of any particular star depends on its location in the field , due to a wavelength gradient introduced by the fabry - perot .",
    "given the full set of scans , daophot @xcite and allframe @xcite were used to determine the brightness of each star in the field .",
    "the scans were then combined to make a small spectrum , which was fitted for the h@xmath62 velocity centroid .",
    "there are particular advantages and disadvantages of this technique compared to the traditional slit chelle spectroscopy employed by coravel .",
    "the latter provides large wavelength coverage , but it is obviously necessary to choose specific stars on which to place the slits . with this configuration ,",
    "the observer has no control over what light goes down the slit , and neighboring stars can be be a severe contaminant in crowded regions .",
    "by contrast , fabry - perot spectroscopy provides only a small wavelength coverage but once the scans are completed , every star in the field produces a spectrum .",
    "this provides an enormous advantage in terms of the number of velocities that can be obtained . in principle , difficulties due to crowding should also be reduced since the use of daophot allows one to apportion the light appropriately in crowded regions , i.e. , accurate photometry can be obtained for faint stars near bright ones .",
    "crowding inevitably remains an issue , however , with its main effect being a progressively stronger bias in the measured velocity dispersion at fainter magnitudes .",
    "if the spectrum of a faint star is affected by either a bright neighbor or the collective light of the bulk of unresolved cluster stars , the measured velocity is pulled closer to the cluster mean , and the velocity dispersion that follows is spuriously low . in the context of our work in  [ subsec : distance ] , where we compare proper - motion to radial - velocity dispersions to estimate the distance to 47 tuc , this effect would ultimately lead to a short value .",
    "there are two options for avoiding this .",
    "one is to remove the effect statistically , by using detailed simulations to define empirical , magnitude - dependent corrections for the stellar velocities .",
    "this approach is pursued by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the other option is simply to make a magnitude cut in the velocity sample , keeping only those stars which are bright enough not to be significantly contaminated in the first place .",
    "this is what we have done here .",
    "figure [ fig : vzhist ] shows the distribution of the combined coravel and fabry - perot radial velocities for stars in three bins of clustercentric radius .",
    "the left - hand panels include only stars with @xmath171 , a magnitude range that has been well explored in previous radial - velocity studies , and which we have confirmed does not suffer significantly from the contamination problems just discussed .",
    "the limit @xmath172 excludes only a handful of measured stars in this region of the cluster but is imposed to guard against radial - velocity `` jitter '' in the brightest cluster giants @xcite .",
    "the faint limit @xmath173 corresponds to the magnitude of the horizontal branch .",
    "the right - hand panels then include stars just slightly fainter than this , in the range @xmath174 .",
    "we have calculated the error - corrected velocity dispersion @xmath175 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : sigmu ] ] ) for the stars in each of the magnitude ranges and radial bins defined in figure [ fig : vzhist ] .",
    "these are listed in the appropriate panels of the figure , where we have also drawn ( strictly for illustrative purposes ) gaussians with dispersions @xmath175 on top of the velocity histograms . comparing these results for the two magnitude bins at",
    "any given radius immediately shows the downward biasing of @xmath175 caused by crowding . comparing the different radii confirms this interpretation of the situation , since ( 1 ) the difference between @xmath175 for the bright and faint samples decreases toward larger clustercentric radii , where the stellar densities are lower ; and ( 2 ) the velocity dispersion at the smallest radii @xmath176 for the fainter stars especially is dramatically ( and unphysically ) lower than that at larger @xmath5 .",
    "although @xmath175 for the stars with @xmath173 is formally lower at @xmath177 than in the range @xmath178 , by some 0.7 km  s@xmath16 , the uncertainty in the calculated dispersion is also 0.70.8 km  s@xmath16 in both radial ranges .",
    "thus , the difference in this case is not highly significant and is likely a reflection of small - number statistics rather than serious contamination .    given the results in figure [ fig : vzhist ] , we choose to include only stars brighter than the horizontal branch , @xmath171 , in the radial - velocity sample used in this paper .",
    "there are only 419 such stars in the inner 105  of 47 tuc , and thus any kinematic estimate of the distance is fundamentally limited to a precision of no better than @xmath179 .",
    "clearly , it is desireable to do better than this , and in principle it is possible to enlarge the radial - velocity sample by , say , applying position - dependent magnitude cuts to remove contaminated stars and/or using data from clustercentric radii beyond the proper - motion field .",
    "however , either of these things would require a sophisticated analysis of the fabry - perot data and an in - depth dynamical modeling that are well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "figure [ fig : velmags ] shows the ra and dec components of proper motion vs.  stellar magnitude for our `` good '' proper - motion sample of  [ subsubsec : kinsamp ] [ i.e. , those stars in table [ tab : posdata ] with @xmath180 and @xmath150 ] , and also for the combined coravel and fabry - perot line - of - sight velocity sample in the inner @xmath182 of 47 tuc .",
    "again , we do not make use here of any data at @xmath183 in the latter case , but figure [ fig : velmags ] emphasizes that radial velocities can indeed be measured for many such faint stars .",
    "the great potential of these data , if their systematic problems can be solved , is clear .",
    "figure [ fig : velmags ] also illustrates the fact that there is currently not one star in 47 tuc which has reliable measurements for all three components of its velocity . as was also mentioned in  [ subsubsec : kinsamp ] , stars brighter than @xmath163 were not measured in any acs frames , and thus do not appear in our proper - motion sample ; but fainter than this limit we can not trust the radial - velocity measurements in general . as a result ,",
    "only statistical comparisons of motions on the plane of the sky and along the line of sight are feasible at this point .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : muvzpos ] compares the spatial distribution of the 419 stars whose radial velocities can be used for a distance estimate ( large points ) , to that of our good proper - motion sample ( small dots , plotted for only a fraction of the 12,974 stars to outline the shape of the field ) .",
    "the circles drawn on this graph have radii of 25  ( which completely encloses the pc - chip area of the proper - motion field ) , 50 , 75 , and 100 . as we discuss further in ",
    "[ subsec : distance ] , the obvious differences between the non - uniform spatial coverages of the two kinematics samples mean that some care must be used in properly comparing the measured velocity dispersions to derive a distance to the cluster .",
    "to optimally explore the implications of the velocity data that we have assembled , we would like to relate them to a dynamical model for 47 tuc .",
    "ideally , this should be constrained by the spatial distribution of stars as a function of magnitude ( mass ) and allow for the possibilities of rotation , velocity anisotropy , axisymmetry ( rather than sphericity ) , the presence of heavy stellar remnants , and so on .",
    "the proper construction of such a comprehensive , global model is clearly a large task that would involve bringing in more data than we have collected here ( e.g. , the spatial and velocity distributions of stars at radii beyond the @xmath184 extent of our proper - motion sample ; information on the stellar luminosity function as a function of position in the cluster ; etc . ) .",
    "our much more modest goal in this paper is to try and extract as much model - independent information as possible from our proper motions , and simply to check whether they are broadly consistent with a very low - level description of the cluster .",
    "the zeroth - order model we use as a reference point is the familiar single - mass , isotropic , modified isothermal sphere of @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite has already fitted 47 tuc with more realistic models of multimass and anisotropic clusters , but using only radial velocities and the surface - brightness profile of subgiants and giants as observational constraints .",
    "thus , applying @xcite s results as they are to assess fine details of our proper - motion data would not really be any more appropriate than using a single - mass and isotropic model ( and re - fitting them would , as we ve suggested , involve work beyond the scope of this paper ) . at any rate ,",
    "@xcite s models imply that velocity anisotropy is only important at large radii @xmath185 , i.e. , in regions of the cluster not probed by our proper motions .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite have quantified the rotation of 47 tuc , using both line - of - sight velocities and proper motions . however , in the innermost @xmath186 covered by our new velocity data , rotation appears to be present only at the level of @xmath187 km s@xmath16 , which is only a fraction of the velocity dispersion there ( see @xcite , and ",
    "[ subsec : norotation ] below ) .",
    "thus , comparison of the proper - motion kinematics with a non - rotating and spherical model can still be profitable in this region .",
    "in  [ subsec : density ] , then , we use our master star list from  [ subsubsec : masterlist ] to construct a new density profile for the brightest stars in the core of 47 tuc , and combine this with wider - field , ground - based surface photometry to fit a @xcite model to the cluster s spatial structure . in  [ subsec : modvel ] and appendix [ sec : kingveldist ]",
    ", we discuss the proper - motion velocity distribution predicted by such a model .",
    "the most important concern for us in constructing a surface - density profile from our master star list is the question of mass segregation .",
    "this involves massive stars ( or heavy remnants ) sinking toward the cluster center and following a more concentrated radial distribution than lower - mass stars , so we can not really speak of a single density profile for the cluster .",
    "in fact , the data in table [ tab : master ] above could be used to explore mass segregation in some detail , but once again it is beyond the scope this paper .",
    "some early work has been done by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the best constraint on the spatial structure of 47 tuc outside the core regions observed by hst is the @xmath1-band surface photometry collated from a variety of sources by @xcite .",
    "the cluster light in this band is dominated by giants and subgiants , all of which have roughly the same ( main - sequence turn - off ) mass .",
    "our immediate interest , then , is in defining an improved profile in the central region for stars of this mass only .",
    "the brightness of the main - sequence turn - off in 47 tuc is @xmath188 ( see table [ tab : basic ] ) , corresponding roughly to magnitude @xmath189 in the f475w bandpass for which our master star list has photometry .",
    "thus , after first checking that the radial distribution does not vary significantly as a function of magnitude for stars brighter than the turn - off , we have used table [ tab : master ] to construct a single density profile for all stars with @xmath190 .",
    "we emphasize that the full master star list has to be used for this , and _ not _ any sample of only proper - motion stars from table [ tab : posdata ] , because the latter have a highly irregular distribution on the sky and a complicated ( and unquantified ) incompleteness as a function of magnitude and clustercentric position .",
    "we first define a series of concentric circular annuli @xmath191 , all contained entirely within the area of the master frame .",
    "the estimates @xmath192 of completeness percentage for individual stars in the master list ( column 10 of table [ tab : master ] ; see  [ subsubsec : compfrac ] ) are then used to calculate the density in each annulus : if there are @xmath193 stars with @xmath190 in the range @xmath194 , then the completeness - corrected number is @xmath195 and the net density follows as @xmath196 . the results of this simple exercise are given in table [ tab : density ] .",
    "note , from comparison of the listed @xmath193 and @xmath197 , that the corrections for incompleteness in this magnitude range are quite modest over our entire field .",

    "comparison of these results with those in figure [ fig : nmumag ] suggests that it is this central - most region , with its relatively precise proper motions , that will provide the most useful kinematical constraints on detailed multimass dynamical models for 47 tuc .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : nmurad ] presents the velocity distribution of the 6,342 brightest proper - motion stars in four concentric circular annuli covering our observed field . from table [",
    "tab : masslum ] , the magnitude range @xmath168 chosen here corresponds to stellar masses @xmath396@xmath251 .",
    "the mean magnitude is @xmath397 , and thus @xmath398essentially the main - sequence turn - off mass , and thus very similar to the stars used to constrain the @xcite model fit in  [ subsec : density ] . these are also the stars for which the velocity errorbars are lowest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : errmua ] ) .",
    "in fact , for clarity in figure [ fig : nmurad ] we only show the error - convolved @xcite - model distributions and their one - sigma confidence bands , as these distributions are not greatly different from the intrinsic ones ( dotted curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : nmumag ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nmumagcore ] ) .",
    "perhaps the most striking aspect of figure [ fig : nmurad ] is that the estimates of @xmath380 come within about 2% of the single - mass @xcite - model @xmath381 at all radii .",
    "that is , the kinematics of stars with the main - sequence turn - off mass are described to rather high accuracy by a dynamical model which assumes that their spatial distribution traces the distribution of total mass in the cluster  even though this includes heavier neutron stars and white dwarfs and a large number of much less massive main - sequence stars , all stratified by mass segregation into different relative density profiles . at the same time , however , the slight disagreement between the observed and predicted velocity dispersions is informative .",
    "looking at the top two panels in particular , @xmath380 stays essentially constant as the clustercentric radius increases out to 50 , while @xmath381 falls by just over @xmath399 , an amount which exceeds the observational errorbars by a factor of @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the stars in 47 tuc are moving in a net gravitational potential which is _ less _ centrally concentrated than that generated by the turn - off and giant - branch stars alone .",
    "this implies that the core of 47 tuc _ can not _ be dominated by heavy stellar remnants such as neutron stars or white dwarfs , which would have a significantly smaller core radius than the bright stars and lead to a steeper drop - off in velocity dispersion with clustercentric radius ( for neutron stars with @xmath400 , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : multir0 ] ] gives @xmath401 vs.  the @xmath402 measured for @xmath262@xmath251 ) .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with other lines of argument .",
    "the multimass and anisotropic models of @xcite require , essentially to obtain a good fit to the detailed shape of the surface - brightness profile in figure [ fig : density ] above , that heavy stellar remnants make up only @xmath120.1% or less of the current total mass of 47 tuc .",
    "the most recent theoretical and observational estimates of the total neutron - star population in 47 tuc lie in the range @xmath4031500 , easily compatible with @xcite s indirect inference @xcite .",
    "but in this case , even allowing for mass segregation to place most of the remnants in the core leads to a structure in which normal stars with @xmath404 dominate the gravity in the inner few core radii by at least an order of magnitude ( see figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "for an average stellar mass around @xmath279 , we expect the total mass distribution to have a large core with @xmath405 ( from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : multir0 ] ] again ) , which is then consistent with the shallow radial dependence of the proper - motion @xmath380 in figure [ fig : nmurad ] .",
    "this will also be seen , more quantitatively , in ",
    "[ subsec : bhmods ] below .",
    "a second point to be taken from figure [ fig : nmurad ] is its demonstration that the `` high - velocity '' stars  those which contribute to @xmath312 measurements which lie significantly above the tails of the @xcite - model curves  are not confined exclusively to the very center of 47 tuc but can be found out to five core radii away .",
    "this is , in fact , expected for proper - motion high - velocity stars , whereas such stars observed in radial velocities are all expected to be observed close to the cluster center in projection .",
    "we now present more details on all of the very fast - moving stars in our full sample .      as was discussed above",
    ", the nominal central escape velocity for our @xcite model of 47 tuc is @xmath406 , or @xmath407 .",
    "the presence of stars in our sample with observed proper - motion speeds above this value is due in part to unavoidable measurement error ( although figure [ fig : nmumag ] shows that this can not account for all of them ) , and at some level it may also reflect the inevitable limitations of single - mass modeling ( as in figure [ fig : nmumagcore ] , fainter stars can attain broader velocity distributions and still remain bound to the cluster )",
    ". nevertheless , such stars are also of potential physical interest as the possible byproducts of close stellar encounters and strong scattering in the very dense core environment .",
    "thus , table [ tab : highpm ] lists the basic properties of all the stars in table [ tab : posdata ] with @xmath151 in both the ra and dec components of proper motion , @xmath150 , @xmath408 , and @xmath392 mas yr@xmath16 .",
    "there are only 46 such stars in our full sample of 12,974 `` good '' proper motions .",
    "figure [ fig : highpm ] identifies these stars relative to the rest of the velocity sample in plots of their distributions in the projected velocity planes @xmath366 and @xmath367 , their @xmath409 positions relative to the cluster center , and a @xmath410 color - magnitude diagram .",

    "+    we have inspected the position vs.  time data for each of the high - velocity stars in table [ tab : highpm ] and figure [ fig : highpm ] individually , and separated them into four categories :    \\(1 ) _ marginal _ : 26 stars have total speeds just barely above 2.6 mas yr@xmath16 , and/or velocity uncertainties that could bring them below @xmath686 mas yr@xmath16 .",
    "table [ tab : highpm ] and the lower right - hand panel of figure [ fig : highpm ] show that the large majority of these stars are fairly faint , with @xmath687 , suggesting that their ( modestly ) high apparent speeds exceed the @xmath688 limit simply because of measurement error .",
    "\\(2 ) _ low @xmath145 _ : six stars with @xmath180 in both velocity components nevertheless have @xmath689 in at least one component .",
    "thus , it ca nt be said with better than 95% confidence that these stars follow genuinely linear motion , let alone whether their fitted velocities are completely reliable .",
    "most of these stars are fairly bright , and additional data from future epochs could either confirm or remove them as high - velocity candidates .",
    "\\(3 ) _ smc _ : five stars are grouped together at @xmath6905.3 mas yr@xmath16 west and @xmath6912.0 mas yr@xmath16 north in the upper left - hand panel of figure [ fig : highpm ] but are not so closely associated with each other in the @xmath367 plane which refers their motion to the center of 47 tuc .",
    "the small magellanic cloud is in the background of our proper - motion field , and its average motion relative to 47 tuc is @xmath692 mas yr@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "thus , we identify these five stars as red giants in the smc . their faint @xmath1 magnitudes and relatively red @xmath693 colors ( see the lower right - hand panel of figure [ fig : highpm ] ) are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "\\(4 ) _ certain _ : nine stars remain which pass all of the first three tests , and which we therefore take to be genuinely high - velocity stars that could well be associated in some way with 47 tuc .",
    "in fact , all of the `` certain '' high - velocity stars have @xmath694 km s@xmath16 , which is obviously a lower limit to their total speed including motion along the line of sight .",
    "this makes it quite unlikely that any dynamical model could allow for them to be bound to the cluster currently .",
    "if they were ever members of 47 tuc , they must have been produced by extreme events inside the cluster core .",
    "on the other hand , it may appear suspicious that six of the nine stars are gathered at the bottom of the main sequence in the lower right of figure [ fig : highpm ] . by construction of our categories , the relative velocity uncertainties on these particular faint stars are not extreme , and their speeds seem secure enough ; but this positioning on the cmd suggests the possibility that at least some of them might be foreground field stars ( of which we do expect to see a handful throughout our field ; cf .",
    "the contamination estimate in table [ tab : basic ] ) .    of the three brighter `` certain '' high - velocity stars ,",
    "two ( m058939 and m053721 , both at the main - sequence turn - off ) were previously identified by @xcite , who also pointed out that they have @xmath695 and thus appear to be moving almost purely radially , with respect to the cluster center , on the plane of the sky .",
    "this is true of only one other `` certain '' star ( m054717 ) , although it is much fainter and falls blueward of the main cluster sequence in the cmd of figure [ fig : highpm ] . even among the marginal and low-@xmath145 stars in table [ tab : highpm ] ,",
    "only a handful show such a preference in their direction of motion .",
    "since we do not have information on the line - of - sight velocity component for any of these stars , it is impossible to say exactly how their total space motions relate to the cluster center . but with this caveat , even if all of the non - smc stars with apparent @xmath392 mas yr@xmath16 are bona - fide high - velocity stars and genuinely associated with 47 tuc , only a small minority show any obvious hint that they might have been ejected directly outward from the very center of the cluster ( as could be expected to happen , for example , as a result of interactions with centrally concentrated binaries or a large black hole ) .",
    "our fastest stars are rather more extreme than the two `` high - velocity '' stars found in the radial - velocity survey by @xcite that prompted our current study .",
    "unfortunately , these two likely cluster members are too bright ( @xmath173 ) to have been included in our proper - motion sample .",
    "however , it is worth noting that their line - of - sight velocities are @xmath696 and 36.7 km s@xmath16 relative to the cluster mean , which would correspond here to about 1.7 and 1.9 mas yr@xmath16 ( for @xmath258 kpc ) and would not even be considered as high velocities by our definition .",
    "meylan et al .  deemed these stars potentially interesting based in part on a lower estimate of the central escape velocity than we have now , and in part on the fact that they appeared in a much smaller sample of velocities .",
    "now , however , it seems that they may simply be part of the normal population of the velocity distribution at @xmath697 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "it must be emphasized that there are an additional 1,392 stars in table [ tab : posdata ] with measured proper motions that have @xmath140 probabilities less than 0.001 in at least one component . as we have already discussed ,",
    "although many of these measurements are effectively noise , some could be associated with perfectly reliable data which sample motions that are nonlinear due to strong accelerations .",
    "any such stars should probably be considered alongside those in table [ tab : highpm ] in any future attempts to understand the extreme tail of the 47 tuc velocity distribution in detail .",
    "but even ignoring any nonlinear motions , it is still significant that the fraction of stars with anomalously high straight - line proper motions is so small : the number is at most @xmath698 within @xmath699 core radii of the cluster center , and it could easily be lower than this by a factor of 4 or more . together with the scattered distribution of these stars in the @xmath367 plane and the highly regular appearance of the velocity distribution of all other stars below @xmath700 mas yr@xmath16 , this should serve as a useful constraint on theoretical analyses of any processes that could produce very fast - moving stars in dense globular cluster cores ( such as the mere presence of a central black hole , or close encounters between various combinations of single stars , binaries , stellar- or intermediate - mass black holes , and black - hole binaries ; see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this",
    "context , note that for a @xcite model with @xmath240 , roughly 7580% of all stars projected to within @xmath701 on the plane of the sky are in fact expected to lie in a sphere of radius @xmath702 around the cluster center .",
    "having seen that there is nothing particularly untoward in the full proper - motion velocity distribution at the center of 47 tuc , the last analyses we undertake involve examining its second moment ( velocity dispersion ) in particular , as a function of stellar magnitude and clustercentric radius in various subsamples of our data .",
    "we do not attempt to model the effects of the cluster rotation in any detail  even though in principle this affects both the radial and the azimuthal components of proper - motion dispersion  both because the patchy azimuthal coverage of our velocity sample ( e.g. , figure [ fig : muvzpos ] ) makes it difficult to constrain this well using only our data , and because the rotation in the inner few core radii is known to be small anyway @xcite .",
    "in  [ subsec : strag ] , we consider the velocity dispersion of blue stragglers in our sample .",
    "section [ subsec : kinmags ] next looks at the dispersion of normal main - sequence stars as a function of magnitude and radius , and obtains quantitative measures of the velocity anisotropy . section [ subsec : distance ] compares the proper - motion and line - of - sight dispersions for turn - off mass stars to derive a kinematic distance to 47 tuc .",
    "having finally estimated the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the cluster core , we draw on it in  [ subsec : norotation ] to argue that the presence of ordered stellar motions ( rotation ) will affect our estimates of the kinematics on these small radial scales at the level of @xmath703 or even less  a source of error that we do not correct for .",
    "last ,  [ subsec : bhmods ] fits the proper - motion @xmath704 profile with very simple modifications of @xcite models to allow for the possibility of a central point mass .    throughout this section , we report all velocity dispersions after correction for both velocity - measurement errors and local transformation errors , as calculated from equation ( [ eq : sigtrue2 ] ) . for convenience ,",
    "however , we drop the subscript `` true '' on @xmath9 from now on . in addition , we prevent the highest - velocity stars of  [ subsec : highpm ] from inflating the estimated dispersions by only using stars with @xmath705 in the calculations  as we did earlier , in  [ subsec : twodvel ] .",
    "all uncertainties are estimated through numerical bootstrap experiments , which were also described in  [ subsec : twodvel ] .",
    "figure [ fig : cmdpos ] above clearly shows the presence of a number of blue stragglers in our `` good '' proper - motion sample , and it is worth noting that none of these appear as high - velocity stars ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : highpm ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xcite used an earlier , more restricted version of the current data set to show qualitatively that the blue stragglers in 47 tuc have a lower velocity dispersion than the giants .",
    "we can now quantify this result .    for our purposes here ,",
    "we define blue stragglers as stars with @xmath706 ( recall that the main - sequence turn - off is at @xmath188 ; table [ tab : basic ] ) and @xmath707 . throughout our entire field",

    ", there are 441 proper - motion stars in the same magnitude range but on the red - giant branch of the cluster [ which we take to be @xmath709 , and of these 191 lie within @xmath167 .",
    "although our velocity sample does not provide an unbiased sampling of the true radial distribution of any stellar population , this already indicates that the blue stragglers are more centrally concentrated than normal cluster members of the same magnitude .",

    "the left - hand panels of the figure then show their one - dimensional distributions of @xmath342 , @xmath343 , and speed @xmath710 , very similarly to figure [ fig : muhists ] above .",

    "apparent too are the low values and large scatter in the error - corrected @xmath745 and @xmath746 at larger radii , for stars in the range @xmath769 . as was also discussed above ,",
    "this is due to the generally large velocity uncertainties at these magnitudes in these areas of the field .",
    "our faint stars might provide useful kinematics constraints on better dynamical models for 47 tuc if the definition of the velocity sample is revised to exclude stars with uncertainties close to or larger than the true velocity dispersion ; but , as figure [ fig : errmua ] makes clear , this will drastically decrease the sample size .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : kinmags ] shows the relative difference of variances , @xmath749 , as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "this is naturally the most uncertain kinematical parameter that we calculate , and its noisy profile reflects this .",
    "the fact that it rarely differs significantly from 0 , and the absence of any sustained trend in clustercentric radius , suggest that @xmath781 on the whole .",
    "again , then , in keeping with the earlier modeling of @xcite and our discussion in  [ sec : veldist ] , the velocity distribution in the inner several core radii of 47 tuc appears to be essentially isotropic .",
    "this impression can be better quantified by considering how the observable velocity dispersions in the @xmath5 and @xmath340 directions and along the line of sight , @xmath782 , are related to the intrinsic , unprojected @xmath783 , @xmath784 , and @xmath785 . for a spherically symmetric star cluster with an ellipsoidal velocity - dispersion tensor ( @xmath786 ) , @xcite and @xcite show that @xmath787 where @xmath289 is the unprojected clustercentric radius and @xmath788 is the angle between the unit vectors @xmath789 and @xmath790 . with velocity anisotropy",

    "so @xmath798 and the averaged proper - motion dispersions satisfy @xmath799 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : aniso ] ) is strictly only valid as an estimator of the _ globally _ averaged anisotropy , and stars spread over an entire cluster should be used to compute it ; it is not a particularly meaningful quantity in narrow annuli such as those considered in table [ tab : kinmags ] , for example .",
    "however , as was also mentioned at the end of  [ subsec : highpm ] , the majority of stars with projected radius @xmath800 in a @xcite - model cluster similar to 47 tuc do actually lie in a sphere of the same radius .",
    "thus , calculating a single @xmath727 for all the stars in our proper - motion sample will still yield a useful approximation to the volume - averaged @xmath727 over the inner @xmath801 core radii of this cluster ( with a small contamination from stars at larger distances along the line of sight ) .",

    "note that the dispersions in the fifth column of the table are just those used in figure [ fig : nmumag ] above and that , as was also discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : twodvel ] , the results at the faintest magnitudes are dominated by measurement errors and are thus unreliable . apart from this",
    ", there is an apparent preference for a slight radial anisotropy ( @xmath803 and @xmath804 ) in the average .",
    "although the departure from isotropy is not highly significant statistically , the sense of it is just what we expect for a dynamical structure in which the stellar orbits are isotropic at the center of the cluster and become gradually more radially biased toward very large radii ( see * ? ? ?",
    "section [ subsec : rvsample ] presented details of a set of radial velocities we have obtained for stars in the inner @xmath805 of 47 tuc .",
    "here we compare the velocity dispersion of these stars to that of our proper - motion stars to estimate a distance to the cluster .",
    "recall that we have useful radial velocities only for 419 bright giants with magnitudes @xmath171 , ( corresponding to masses @xmath806 ) , whereas all of our proper - motion stars are fainter than this and can have masses as low as @xmath807 . in order not to bias the derived distance by comparing the kinematics of stars with too widely different masses , we work only with rather bright proper - motion stars : @xmath168 , and thus @xmath808 according to the formula in table [ tab : masslum ] . applying the color cuts of equation ( [ eq : colcut ] ) to exclude blue stragglers , and the velocity cut in equation ( [ eq : velcut ] ) ,",
    "we are left with 6,336 proper - motion stars having an average magnitude @xmath809 and hence an average mass of @xmath810 .",
    "since the stars in the core of 47 tuc are expected to be in energy equipartition , we might naturally worry that a proper - motion sample with @xmath168 could have a dispersion some @xmath811 times larger than a sample of stars with masses strictly equal to those in our radial - velocity sample  in which case , the true distance to the cluster might be _ longer _ than what we derive in this section , by about 3.5% ( roughly 0.15 kpc ) . while this is a valid concern in principle , in practice we have found that carrying out the analysis below using a smaller proper - motion sample of 1,895 stars with @xmath812 ( for a mean mass of @xmath813 ) formally changes our inferred distance in the opposite way to what we would expect , but by a statistically insignificant amount : @xmath814 .",
    "given our inability to resolve directly the signature of energy equipartition in the kinematics of the brightest proper - motion stars , we simply present the results of our work with the larger , @xmath168 sample and do not attempt to compensate for any anticipated effect .",
    "another potential complication is that in using these data to estimate the distance to 47 tuc , we assume that the cluster is not rotating .",
    "as we have mentioned already , it is known that 47 tuc _ does _ rotate @xcite , but we are saved from having to apply much more sophisticated dynamical modeling ( with more free parameters , constrained by additional data with further sources of uncertainty ) by the fact that the level of rotation in the central - most regions of the cluster presently under consideration is low relative to the random motions . in  [ subsec : norotation ] , we give a brief but more quantitative a posteriori justification for our neglect of this issue .",
    "given equations ( [ eq : velcomps ] ) and the definition @xmath791 , it is straightforward to show that the velocity dispersions projected along the line of sight and into the radial and azimuthal directions on the plane of the sky are connected by @xmath815 at any radius @xmath289 in a spherical and non - rotating cluster , for all three dispersions measured in the same units . if we then perform the same spatial averaging as in  [ subsec : kinmags ] , substitute equation ( [ eq : aniso ] ) for @xmath66 , and use equation ( [ eq : convert ] ) to convert between proper motions measured in mas yr@xmath16 and radial velocities in km s@xmath16 , the distance follows as @xmath816 for non - zero anisotropy , this formula is really applicable only to a global sample of stars covering the entire cluster , although  as with the expression above for @xmath727its use for our @xmath817 field is still justified . and in any case ,",
    "if @xmath818 it is more generally valid for any local sample ; @xmath819 is then simply an improved estimate of a single proper - motion variance given two independent estimates from the @xmath5 and @xmath340 components .",
    "thus , we have estimated the distance to 47 tuc in two different ( though interdependent ) ways , both of which are illustrated in figure [ fig : distance ] .",

    "note that the @xmath8729% relative uncertainty in @xmath116 is twice the amount caused by number statistics alone , due to the necessity of correcting for the different spatial distributions of the two velocity samples .    as we discussed in connection with figure [ fig : nmurad ]",

    "gives a distance identical to that in equation ( [ eq : dglobal ] ) , demonstrating that the result is insensitive to fine details of the model used to smooth over the spatial distributions .",
    "recent determinations of the distance to 47 tuc by standard cmd fitting range from @xmath44 kpc @xcite to @xmath43 kpc @xcite , while a fit to the white - dwarf cooling sequence by @xcite returned @xmath45 kpc .",
    "our result clearly supports the shorter white - dwarf value ( which in turn implies a cluster age of 13 gyr ; see @xcite ) , although the lowest of the cmd - based distance estimates may still be consistent within the uncertainties .      it would be surprising if more sophisticated modeling did not uncover slight biases in our distance estimate due to our simplifying assumptions of spherical symmetry and zero rotation .",
    "but it seems very doubtful that the value of @xmath116 could change by more than the 9% margin of error already allowed by the formal uncertainties .",
    "in fact , we expect that any rotation - related biases in the kinematics we have derived will be present only at the level of @xmath122% , which is comparable to the minimal , @xmath878 statistical errorbars that are unavoidable even in the brightest and lowest - uncertainty subsamples of proper - motion stars .",
    "the signature of rotation in the radial velocities appears as a sinusoidal dependence of @xmath345 on the projected azimuth @xmath340 , and simply fitting a sine curve to the 419 reliable line - of - sight velocities available at @xmath182 yields a rotation amplitude @xmath879 km s@xmath16 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged velocity _ variance _ due to rotation alone is therefore @xmath880 .",
    "meanwhile , the observed , error - corrected variance for all 419 radial - velocity stars together is @xmath881 ( see  [ subsec : distance ] ) . the velocity dispersion over our field that is due to truly random stellar motions , rather than rotation , is then @xmath882just over 98% of the observed value .",
    "the velocity distribution on these spatial scales in 47 tuc is essentially isotropic (  [ subsec : kinmags ] ) , and there is evidence that the inclination angle of the rotation axis is @xmath1245@xmath883 @xcite , so any signature of rotation in our proper - motion dispersions can also be expected to appear at roughly @xmath122% levels , which is too small to discern accurately once all sources of statistical uncertainty ( number statistics ; measurement and transformation errors ; irregular spatial distributions ) are taken into account . in any event ,",
    "our distance estimate particularly should be rather robust , since it relies on the _ ratio _ @xmath884 .",
    "our final analysis looks at the kinematics of the innermost @xmath123  of 47 tuc , the area in which the effects of a compact central mass concentration ( if one is present ) should be most clearly observable .    returning for a moment to the results of  [ subsec : distance ] , it is a simple matter to calculate the observable velocity dispersion ( for stars at the turn - off mass ) at the exact center of 47 tuc from our estimates of the @xcite - model scale parameter , @xmath288 . with @xmath240 ,",
    "the projected one - dimensional @xmath885 is 0.982 . for the @xmath288 values associated with @xmath875 ( arguably a better description of the inner one core radius of the proper - motion velocity - dispersion profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : distance ] ) , we thus have @xmath886 obviously this assumes that velocity dispersion is nearly constant as @xmath5 approaches 0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the innermost point in the top panel of figure [ fig : distance ] appears to fall above this extrapolation . even though the discrepancy is hardly significant at even the one - sigma level , it is nevertheless of potential interest in light of recent claims for evidence of massive black holes at the centers of globular clusters .",
    "it is now well established that the masses of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies correlate tightly with the central velocity dispersions of the stellar bulges @xcite .",
    "recently , claims have been made , on the basis of radial - velocity studies , that the galactic globular cluster m15 @xcite and the very massive cluster g1 in andromeda @xcite may harbor large central black holes with masses @xmath887@xmath888 .",
    "if so , such black holes could lie on a simple extension of the @xmath889@xmath9 relation for galaxies .",
    "for m15 , the data show less than a 1-@xmath9 significance for a black hole @xcite , and theoretical models show there is no need to invoke one @xcite .",
    "given the data of @xcite , @xcite concluded there is no need for a black hole in g1 either , although @xcite use more recent data to argue for an improved significance of detection .",
    "it is thus unclear whether globular clusters do in fact contain `` intermediate - mass '' central black holes , and it is worthwhile asking whether our proper motions in 47 tuc can add anything to this discussion .",
    "the galactic @xmath889@xmath9 relation given by @xcite uses the bulge velocity dispersion averaged over an effective radius , which in a @xmath240 @xcite model is @xmath890 .",
    "given equation ( [ eq : sigcenter ] ) , then , @xmath891 km  s@xmath16 in 47 tuc , and extrapolating the @xcite relation gives a `` predicted '' black - hole mass of roughly @xmath892 .",
    "this corresponds to a sphere of influence @xmath893 and suggests a potential observational signature in our proper - motion data .",
    "on the other hand , there is no a priori justification for extrapolating the empirical scaling for galaxies down to the globular cluster range , and the results of doing so are highly dependent on the adopted parametrization of the relation .",
    "thus , for example , the steeper dependence of black - hole mass on ( central ) galactic velocity dispersion advocated by @xcite leads to @xmath894 in 47 tuc , which would have a much smaller effect on the observable kinematics .",
    "conversely , the log - quadratic relation of @xcite implies an untenable ( though highly uncertain ) @xmath895@xmath896 .    aside from these rough expectations , it is also worth noting that @xcite use the positions and dispersion measures of millisecond pulsars in the core of 47 tuc , together with a _",
    "_ upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of a central source , to estimate an upper limit of @xmath897 for the mass of any central black hole .",
    "this corresponds to a sphere of influence , @xmath898 , which would be very difficult to probe with the current kinematical data .",
    "on the other hand , an x - ray upper mass limit is fairly sensitive to the assumed efficiency and spectral temperature for radiation from gas accreting onto a black hole @xmath899)uncertainties that are , of course , avoided with kinematical mass estimates .      to address this issue ,",
    "we have constructed a series of modified @xcite models allowing for the presence of a central point mass , and fitted these to the proper - motion dispersion profile @xmath8 .",
    "we first find the dimensionless density profile @xmath900 and enclosed mass profile @xmath901 , both as functions of @xmath902 , for a regular @xcite model with given @xmath245 .",
    "then we add a black hole with dimensionless mass @xmath903 , assume that the stellar density profile is unchanged , and solve the isotropic jeans equation , @xmath904\\ , \\ ] ] for a new @xmath905 profile ( by integrating inward from the original tidal radius , where @xmath906 ) .",
    "the projected , one - dimensional velocity - dispersion profile to be compared with the observed @xmath8 follows from the usual averaging of @xmath907 along the line of sight ( e.g. , eq .",
    "[ [ eq : modsigz ] ] ) .    note that these models do not have the density cusp that is usually associated intuitively with the presence of a central black hole .",
    "this is because they do not attempt to address the origin of the black hole or the dynamical evolution of the stellar distribution function in its presence .",
    "rather , they simply describe the self - consistent kinematics of stars around a dark point mass _ given _ that the density structure is well matched by a normal @xcite model .",
    "@xcite use detailed n - body simulations to show that the visible stars in globular clusters with intermediate - mass central black holes can indeed be reasonably well described by @xcite - type density profiles ( the expected density cusp is essentially confined to heavy stellar remnants ) , and that the stellar kinematics are accurately reproduced by isotropic jeans modeling .",
    "the greatest limitation to our simple approach is the assumption of a single stellar mass , since in principle neutron stars or heavy white dwarfs that are strongly concentrated to the center by mass segregation can affect the kinematics of observable stars in ways similar to a true point mass . although we have already argued that the total mass of such remnants in 47 tuc is quite small (  [ subsec : twodvel ] ; see the discussion around figure [ fig : nmurad ] ) , ignoring the issue altogether means that fitting the projected solutions of equation ( [ eq : kingbh ] ) to an observed @xmath8 profile is likely to overestimate the mass of any black hole in general .    to fit the black - hole @xcite models , we first calculated the @xmath8 profile again for our `` good '' proper - motion stars with @xmath168 and restricted colors as in equation ( [ eq : colcut ] ) , but binned into 1-wide annuli in order to resolve the small - radius behavior better than we did in ",
    "[ subsec : kinmags ] and  [ subsec : distance ] .",
    "( however , we did check that our results are insensitive to the binning . )",

    "every model profile was projected along the line of sight , smoothed with an annular filter of width @xmath912 to match our treatment of the data , and fit to the observed @xmath8 profile by finding the normalizations @xmath235 and @xmath288 that minimize the usual error - weighted @xmath140 statistic .",

    "we argued that this implies that the mass distribution in the inner few core radii of 47 tuc is dominated by stars less massive than the main - sequence turn - off mass , rather than by heavy remnants such as neutron stars or massive white dwarfs .",
    "this is consistent with other suggestions , from independent modeling and observations , that the total mass of such remnants is quite low in this cluster .    in  [ subsec : highpm ] we took especial care to examine the properties of stars with apparent proper - motion speeds above the nominal central escape velocity of 2.6 mas yr@xmath16 .",

    "fewer than ten , or @xmath973 , can be said unequivocally not to have been scattered to high velocities by measurement errors , and it is still possible that some of these may be interloping field stars .",
    "thus , we have not found any evidence for a significant population of very fast - moving , `` nonthermal '' stars in the core of 47 tuc , such as had been suggested on the basis of some earlier radial - velocity surveys involving much smaller samples .",
    "we emphasize , however , that we have not examined in any detail the @xmath974 of stars in our catalogue which are not fit well by straight - line proper motions .",

    "[ subsec : strag ] we showed that the velocity dispersion of 18 blue stragglers within @xmath153 ( one core radius ) is smaller than the dispersion of comparably bright stars on the cluster red - giant branch , by a factor of about @xmath4 . together with other studies in the literature showing that blue stragglers are more centrally concentrated than the giants in 47 tuc , this is consistent with the blue stragglers being on average about twice as massive as normal main - sequence turn - off stars .",
    "in  [ subsec : kinmags ] we presented the run of proper - motion dispersion with clustercentric radius for stars in various magnitude ranges , compared it with the expected behavior in a single - mass @xcite model , and showed quantitatively that the average velocity anisotropy in the inner @xmath975 core radii of 47 tuc is  as expected  negligible .",
    "section [ subsec : distance ] compared the line - of - sight velocity - dispersion profile defined by 419 bright giants ( @xmath173 ) within @xmath182 with the proper - motion dispersion profile of 6,336 of our stars with @xmath168 ( and , thus , masses comparable to the giants ) .",
    "this led to a kinematic estimate of the distance to the cluster : @xmath46 kpc .",
    "while this result was obtained by ignoring the rotation of 47 tuc , on the small spatial scales probed by our kinematics the rotation is quite weak and should not affect our estimate of @xmath116 by more than 23 percent at most (  [ subsec : norotation ] ) .",
    "our distance is consistent with results in the literature from fitting to the white - dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "we also used a @xcite model to extrapolate the velocity dispersions to @xmath967 , giving improved estimates of the central @xmath3 and @xmath175 ( see table [ tab : basic ] ) .    finally , ",
    "[ subsec : bhmods ] focused on the kinematics and density structure in the innermost few arcseconds of 47 tuc .",
    "we fit the proper - motion velocity - dispersion profile with simplistic models based on those of @xcite but allowing for the presence of a central point mass .",
    "we found no clear need here for an `` intermediate - mass '' black hole of the type recently claimed to have been detected in other globular clusters .",
    "nevertheless , one with a mass @xmath976@xmath11 could be accommodated by the data at the 1-@xmath9 level .",
    "it would thus seem difficult to use these data alone either to prove or to disprove whether the well known correlation , between supermassive black - hole mass and nuclear velocity dispersion in galaxies , extends to globular clusters .",
    "the overarching conclusion from this work is that the core of 47 tucanae is remarkably unsurprising in its dynamical structure .",
    "the velocity distribution is essentially isotropic and close to gaussian , with radial and ( secondarily ) mass dependences which  aside from a few relatively small details which can be at least qualitatively understood ",

    "our work was aimed expressly at an investigation of the core of this cluster , and our results have emphasized that any truly new insight into star - cluster dynamics from large proper - motion samples may be more likely to come from surveys of more off - center fields , where the potential is weaker , relaxation may not be so advanced , and velocity anisotropy in particular could be much more pronounced .",

    "this appendix addresses the need to interpret our observed velocity dispersions in terms of the true dispersion ( of the intrinsic stellar velocity distribution ) and the additional contribution made by our measurement errors .",
    "there are two sources of error .",
    "the first , which is random , relates to the effect that simple errors in position measurements have on the observed proper motions .",
    "the second , which is systematic , comes from our use of local transformations to bring a star s coordinates at any epoch into our master - frame system ( see  [ subsubsec : local ] ) .",
    "recall that by applying standard linear regression to infer proper motions from our measurements of displacement vs.  time , we have assumed that the position measurement error for each star at each epoch is gaussian distributed with a mean of 0 , in which case the errorbars on the fitted @xmath146 and @xmath147 represent the dispersions of gaussian distributions of ra- and dec - velocity measurement error .",
    "the errorbars on the two velocity components need not be the same for any one star and are in general different from one star to the next , but the mean measurement error is always assumed to be 0 .",
    "thus , the distribution of measurement error in either component of velocity for a set of any @xmath110 stars from our sample is given by the normalized probability density @xmath977\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath978 represents the error in either the ra or the dec component of the observed proper motion and @xmath353 is the uncertainty in that component for the @xmath979 star in the sample , as given by our least - squares fitting .",
    "any observed velocity @xmath980 can then be viewed as the sum @xmath981 where @xmath982 is a random variable drawn from the ( a priori unknown ) error - free velocity distribution as a function of stellar position and magnitude in 47 tuc , and the measurement error @xmath978 is a random variable drawn from the distribution ( [ eq : errdist ] ) .",
    "if the measurement errors are uncorrelated with the velocities themselves ( as the lack of correlation between the observed @xmath146 and the least - squares uncertainties @xmath154 in figure [ fig : errmua ] of  [ subsubsec : pmerrors ] implies is the case ) , then the expectation value of the observed ra or dec velocity for a set of @xmath110 stars is simply @xmath983 since @xmath984 vanishes by virtue of equation ( [ eq : errdist ] ) .",
    "thus , an unbiased estimate of the mean velocity with no measurement error is provided by the usual @xmath985    for uncorrelated random variables , the variances are similarly additive , regardless of the form of the underlying distribution(s ) of the variables .",
    "thus , @xmath986 or @xmath987 = e[(\\mu_{\\rm cor}-\\langle\\mu\\rangle_{\\rm cor})^2 ] + e[(\\delta\\mu)^2 ] \\ .\\ ] ] switching now to more standard notation , we write @xmath988 and @xmath989 ; use equation ( [ eq : errdist ] ) to evaluate @xmath990 ; and finally use the sample standard deviation as an unbiased estimate of @xmath991 to obtain @xmath992    - \\frac{1}{{\\cal n}}\\sum_{i=1}^{{\\cal n } } \\delta_i^2 \\ .\\ ] ] that is , the proper estimator for the error - corrected velocity dispersion @xmath993 of any @xmath110 stars with unequal velocity uncertainties is obtained by subtracting the rms errorbar in quadrature from the usual standard deviation of the observed velocities .",
    "the only assumption behind equation ( [ eq : sigmu ] ) is that the velocity _ errors _ are normally distributed , and thus it holds true for any form of the actual velocity distribution . in particular , the latter need not be gaussian  indeed , it need not be specified at all .",
    "there remains one further correction to be applied to @xmath993 in order to reach an estimate of the true velocity dispersion : as was mentioned in ",
    "[ subsubsec : local ] , the use of local transformations to map stellar positions at our ten epochs into the master - frame coordinate system introduces an unavoidable error in the observed velocity dispersion , which is completely separate from the inflation of dispersion due to measurement error .",
    "suppose that , as in  [ subsubsec : local ] , we use the positions of the @xmath123 nearest neighbors of a star at some epoch to define the local transformation of that star into the reference - frame coordinate system .",
    "suppose further that there are no position - measurement errors in any frame at any epoch .",
    "then the formal error in all local transformations is zero , and the mean and dispersion of the observed velocities are automatically @xmath994 and @xmath993 in the notation of the preceding discussion .",
    "how do these relate to the true moments of the intrinsic velocity distribution ?    to address this question we look , without loss of generality , at a single component ( any component ) of position in the master - frame system , measured for a given target star and for its nearest @xmath123 neighbors at any two epochs separated by @xmath995 in time .",
    "call these positions @xmath118 for the target star and @xmath996 for the neighbor stars . by applying local coordinate transformations , the proper motion @xmath982 we derive for a star is really measuring the change in its position relative to the centroid of its nearest neighbors at the two epochs .",
    "that is , if @xmath997 denotes the centroid of the neighbor stars , then @xmath998 where the primes identify the second - epoch positions .",
    "then , noting that the expectation value of the position change for any star is @xmath999 ( where @xmath1000 refers to the true distribution of absolute proper motions ) , equations ( [ eq : relmu ] ) and ( [ eq : centroid ] ) together imply that @xmath1001 this only says , quite sensibly , that on average the velocity of a star relative to its nearest neighbors will be 0 .",
    "this is , of course , exactly what the true situation is , so that even though the local transformation scheme leads to an error in every observed stellar velocity , the _ average _ error is 0 .",
    "by contrast , the relationship between the observed dispersion @xmath993 and the second moment @xmath380 of the true velocity distribution is nontrivial . from equation ( [ eq : relmu ] )",
    "we have @xmath1002 where @xmath1003 from equation ( [ eq : centroid ] ) . clearly , @xmath1004 , while the variance of @xmath1005 follows from its definition as the sample mean for the @xmath123 neighbors of our target star : @xmath1006 .",
    "finally , then , equation ( [ eq : relvar ] ) yields @xmath1007    thus , from the combination of equations ( [ eq : meanmu ] ) and ( [ eq : relmean ] ) we _ expect _ to find @xmath1008 for the mean relative proper motion ( in any direction ) of any set of stars ; and by combining equations ( [ eq : sigmu ] ) and ( [ eq : sigcor ] ) we _ calculate _",

    "it is well known that the velocity distribution at any radius in a @xcite model cluster takes the form of a `` lowered maxwellian , '' i.e. , a gaussian distribution in @xmath1010 minus a position - dependent constant related to the local escape speed .",
    "when comparing such models to data , however , it is necessary to integrate this simple distribution over all phase - space coordinates for which we have no direct information .",
    "this will always include at least a projection along the line of sight , which is already nontrivial . in a case where only proper - motion data are being considered ,",
    "an additional integration over one component of velocity is also required ; while if only radial - velocity data are being modeled , yet another integration over a second velocity component is necessary . in this appendix",
    ", we develop general expressions and outline a computational scheme for these various marginalized velocity distributions .",

    "we are additionally interested here in the full distribution of projected velocities , not just the second moment ; and we have data for the joint distribution of velocities in two orthogonal directions on the plane of the sky , not just a single component .",

    "<S> we have used hst imaging of the central regions of the globular cluster 47 tucanae (= ngc 104 ) , taken with the wfpc2 and acs cameras between 1995 and 2002 , to derive proper motions and @xmath0- and @xmath1-band magnitudes for 14,366 stars within 100  ( about 5 core radii ) of the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the largest set of member velocities collected for any globular cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the stars involved range in brightness from just fainter than the horizontal branch of the cluster , to more than 2.5 mag below the main - sequence turn - off . in the course of obtaining these kinematical data , we also use a recent set of acs images to define a list of astrometrically calibrated positions ( and f475w magnitudes ) for nearly 130,000 stars in a larger , @xmath2 central area . </S>",
    "<S> we describe our data - reduction procedures in some detail and provide the full position , photometry , and velocity data in the form of downloadable electronic tables . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the star counts to obtain a new estimate for the position of the cluster center and to define the density profile of main - sequence turn - off and giant - branch stars into essentially zero radius , thus constraining the global spatial structure of the cluster better than before . a single - mass , isotropic king - model fit to it is then used as a rough point of reference against which to compare the gross characteristics of our proper - motion data . </S>",
    "<S> we search in particular for any evidence of very fast - moving stars , in significantly greater numbers than expected for the extreme tails of the velocity distribution in a sample of our size . </S>",
    "<S> we find that likely fewer than 0.1% , and no more than about 0.3% , of stars with measured proper motions have total speeds above the nominal central escape velocity of the cluster . at lower speeds , </S>",
    "<S> the proper - motion velocity distribution very closely matches that of a regular king model ( which is itself nearly gaussian given the high stellar density ) at all observed radii . </S>",
    "<S> considerations of only the velocity dispersion then lead to a number of results . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) blue stragglers in the core of 47 tuc have a velocity dispersion @xmath3 smaller than that of the cluster giants by a factor of @xmath4 , consistent with the former being on average twice as massive as normal , main - sequence turn - off stars . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the velocity distribution in the inner five core radii of the cluster is essentially isotropic , and the detailed dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath5 for the brighter stars suggests that heavy remnants contribute only a fraction of a percent to the total cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> both of these results are in keeping with earlier , more realistic multimass and anisotropic models of 47 tuc . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) using a sample of 419 line - of - sight velocities measured for bright giants within @xmath6 , we obtain a kinematic distance to the cluster : @xmath7 kpc , formally some 10%20% lower than recent estimates based on standard cmd fitting , and more consistent with the value implied by fitting to the white - dwarf cooling sequence . and </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) by fitting simple models of isotropic , single - mass stellar clusters with central point masses to our observed @xmath8 profile , we infer a 1-@xmath9 upper limit of @xmath10@xmath11 for any intermediate - mass black hole in 47 tuc . </S>",
    "<S> the formal best - fit hole mass ranges from 0 if only the kinematics of stars near the main - sequence turn - off mass are modeled , to @xmath12700@xmath13 if fainter , less massive stars are also used . </S>",
