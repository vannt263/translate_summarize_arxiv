    "lessons learnt from studies of objects in our local universe is that stellar and gaseous disks can , and do , present the most striking decouplings ( e.g. , jarrett et al . 2003 ; block et al .",
    "1996 , 1994 ; block & wainscoat 1991 ) .",
    "there is no reason why such decouplings should not persist at higher redshift space .",
    "the evolved stellar disks of high - z galaxies in the hdf have never been explored at restframe k@xmath2 band .",
    "images of galaxies with redshifts @xmath5 or higher secured using the hubble space telescope and nicmos never penetrate the dusty , gaseous population i mask . at z values",
    "greater than 3 , even the h - band 1.6@xmath3 observed flux stems from emission shortward of 4000  . examining hdf galaxies at restframe i ( 0.84@xmath3 ) would not be sufficient ; attenuation by dust even in the i band for some local field galaxies can still be at a level of 50 percent ( block 1996 ) .",
    "a poignant remark pertaining to those ` irregular ' galaxies comprising the faint blue excess was made by ellis ( 1997 ) :    _ `` it is tempting to connect the rapidly evolving blue galaxies in the redshift surveys with the irregular / peculiar / merger systems ... could this category of objects not simply be an increasing proportion of sources rendered unfamiliar by redshift or other effects ? ... it is not yet clear whether the available local data samples are properly represented in all classes ... the precise distinction between late - type spiral and irregular / peculiar / merger may remain uncertain . '' _    in their study , abraham et al .",
    "( 1996 ) commented that the `` shape of the faint - end number count for peculiar objects is sensitive to the large systematic uncertainties inherent in the visual classification of these objects '' .",
    "submillimetre observations of galaxies at redshifts as large as 4 to 5 show that dust masses do not decrease with redshift : dust masses at these redshifts may still be of order 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 ( norman & braun 1996 ) .    in this study , dedicated to j. mayo greenberg",
    ", we ask the question : what would the dust penetrated images of spiral galaxies at high redshift z @xmath4 1 look like , when the effects of dust are ` swept away ' and when redshift as well as surface brightness dimming effects of @xmath8z@xmath9 are fully accounted for ?",
    "the launch of the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) is expected during this decade .",
    "it is expected to be placed in an orbit 1.5 million kilometres away at the lagrangian point l2 , which is in line with the sun and the earth .",
    "the ngst science drivers dictate a class 6 m size .",
    "imaging capabilities are expected to extend over the 0.6@xmath3 to 20@xmath3 wavelength range .",
    "turbulence in our atmosphere distorts wavefronts passing through , leading to rapid degradation of the image . for ngst",
    ", any degradation of diffraction limited performance will only be the result of distortions in the telescope and instruments , together with pointing and tracking errors .",
    "the sky background will only be the result of scattered sunlight off , and emission from , interplanetary dust grains .",
    "the fundamental advantage of ngst for our morphological imaging purposes discussed here , will be the extremely low ir background shortward of 25@xmath3 .    in order to probe galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and 1.2 at restframe k@xmath2 , imaging detectors in the broadband l ( 3.7@xmath3 ; bandpass @xmath10l=0.65@xmath3 ) and m regimes ( 4.7@xmath3 ; @xmath10m=0.45@xmath3 )",
    "are required . at m , for example",
    ", the sky background at an excellent groundbased site such as mauna kea is 10 million times brighter than it will be for ngst ( see figure 1 in gillett & mountain 1998 , where a sky background of @xmath4 305 jansky arcsec@xmath11 is indicated from mauna kea , but only 1.9@xmath1210@xmath13 jansky arcsec@xmath11 for ngst ) .",
    "full details of the design of an 8192 @xmath12 8192 pixel format near - infrared camera operating on ngst from 0.6 to 5.3@xmath3 ( which includes the l and m bands ) may be found in bally & & morse ( 1999 ) .",
    "we follow the simulation methodology of takamiya ( 1999 ) .",
    "the simulations recreate the images of nearby z @xmath4 0 spirals when moved out to higher redshifts , always in a pre - selected restframe . here",
    "the local spirals are simulated at redshifts z=0.7 and z=1.2 in the dust penetrated k@xmath2 restframe .",
    "since the restframes are matched , no pixel @xmath14 correlations are applied ( takamiya 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , no spectral energy distribution templates are needed : these are only required for restframes which are not matched , such as when simulating hdf restframe uv images from local z @xmath4 0 optical ones .",
    "the angular diameters of the simulated galaxies do not scale linearly with distance but depend on the world model adopted ( see figure 2 in baum 1972 ) . assuming a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) big bang cosmology with a hubble constant of 65 km / s / mpc and a deceleration parameter q@xmath15 of 0.1",
    ", the age of the universe today is approximately 14 gyr .",
    "the lookback times for z in the interval 0.7  1.2 are then about 6.0 and 7.8 gyr . with galaxies now confirmed to almost a redshift of 6 , galaxy formation ages shorter than 2 billion years must be seriously considered .",
    "nevertheless , assuming an average epoch for galaxy formation of 2 billion years , the evolved disks of galaxies at z @xmath4 0.7  1.2 could lie in the 4  6 gyr range . for local field spiral galaxies observed at k@xmath2 ,",
    "the ages of ` red ' stars seen in dust penetrated images can lie anywhere from 4 gyr and older ( see the population synthesis models of charlot et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "upper limits for the lookback times at z=0.7 and z=1.2 in a frw cosmology where q@xmath15 is increased to 0.5 are 5.5 and 8.2 gyr respectively ; the cosmic age decreases to 10 gyr .",
    "restframe uv spectra of high z galaxies are invariably dominated by young stellar populations only , although two exceptions are known .",
    "they are 53w069 and 53w091 ( windhorst et al .",
    "2000 ) where keck spectra showed that their restframe uv light was dominated by old stellar populations with apparent ages of @xmath4 4.5 gyr at z=1.43 and @xmath4 3.5 gyr at z=1.55 .    for all our ngst simulations , we assume that the sky background is about twice the minimum background observed by cobe ( hauser 1994 ) .",
    "we assume a sky surface brightness at l and m of 19.55 and 17.31 magnitudes per square second of arc , respectively .",
    "( from good near - infrared groundbased sites , the corresponding sky surface backgrounds at l and m are @xmath4 5.99 mag arcsec@xmath11 and 0.24 mag arcsec@xmath11 respectively ) .",
    "we furthermore assume pixel sizes of 50 milliarcseconds , a gain of 4 electrons per adu ( analog digital unit ) , a readout noise of 4 electrons and an output point spread function of gaussian distribution , with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.12@xmath1 . assuming eight optical surfaces with 95% transmission ( these include the primary and secondary mirrors as well as lenses and filters in the detector ) and a 40% detector quantum efficiency , the system throughput is taken to be 26% . for all simulations , an on source integration time of one hour , was adopted .",
    "the galaxies selected for our simulation runs , for which groundbased k@xmath2 images are available , come from a variety of groundbased sites .",
    "the telescopes used for the observations include the 3 m nasa irtf and the 2.2 m atop mauna kea , the 2.2 m at la silla and the 2.3 m at mount stromlo .",
    "the galaxies form part of a much larger sample of spirals used to develop our near - infrared classification scheme , and full details of each image may be found in block et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and references therein .    included in table 1",
    "are spiral galaxies spanning the entire range of dust - penetrated classes , from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "even - sided galaxies , wherein m=2 is the dominant fourier component , are designated by using a prefix ` e ' ; lopsided , one - armed spirals ( with a dominant m=1 mode ) bear the ` l ' prefix ( block & puerari 1999 ) . optical arm classes of elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1987 ) are cited , when available , in column 4 .",
    "the redshifts of the local sample are listed in column 5 , determined from velocities given in the catalogue of de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . when moved out to a cosmological distance corresponding to z=1.2 , local grand design spirals such as ngc 2997 ( z=0.0036 ) and ngc 5861 ( z=0.006 )",
    "only span @xmath4 2@xmath1 in diameter , whereas ngc 309 , the farthest galaxy in our local sample ( z=0.0188 ) spans only 5@xmath1 in diameter .",
    "the angular diameters of all galaxies in our simulations lie between 2@xmath1  5@xmath1 .",
    ".spiral galaxies used in our pilot analysis .",
    "column 2 gives the hubble type ; column 3 the dust penetrated class , column 4 the elmegreen & elmegreen arm classes , and column 5 the redshift [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for local field galaxies , block & puerari ( 1999 ) find a duality of spiral structure .",
    "one classification for the population i disk ; often a radically different one for the population ii disk .",
    "there is no reason why this kinematical distinction should not be equally applicable to spiral galaxies at redshifts of approximately 1 .",
    "the fundamental rather than incidental need to develop a near - infrared classification scheme is kinematically driven ; 95 percent of the mass distribution remains unprobed in the optical mask .",
    "ngst will clearly cause a renaissanse in identifying such dualities for galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the need for an ngst larger than 4 m is compelling for morphological studies of stellar disks .",
    "a comparative performance between a 4 m ngst and 8 m ngst is evident in the simulations .",
    "note the appearance of missing entries in table 4 compared to table 2 .",
    "our simulations always assume diffraction limited images and furthermore , that the pixel sizes are such that the point spread function is critically sampled . clearly for a 4 m ngst",
    "the sampling in arcseconds is worse than for a class 8 m ngst , and the pitch angles for some of the arms , measurable with an 8 m ngst , are no longer measurable with a class 4 m ngst . for those galaxies with a missing entry in table 4 ,",
    "the arms have become blended into the disk in the simulated 4 m ngst image and can not be unambiguously traced .",
    "we have also run a series of simulations using groundbased class 8 m telescopes equipped with l and m detectors . due to the huge factor of @xmath4 10@xmath18 jansky",
    "arcsec@xmath11 corresponding to a @xmath4 17.5 magnitude arcsec@xmath11 increase of the m sky background , at a redshift of 1.2 no spiral structure can be seen in any of the m band images .",
    "thermal emission from molecules in our lower atmosphere and from the ambient temperature of the telescope itself dominate the dark sky background longward of 2.3@xmath3 at groundbased sites .",
    "herein lies the great benefit of ngst .",
    "ngst is expected to be passively cooled to a temperature of @xmath4 30 k thus minimising a contribution from the telescope itself , and of the instruments , to an unprecedently dark sky background .",
    "probably the final topic which received much attention by the late professor j. mayo greenberg was the subject of dust in the high - redshift universe : hence the dedication of this research report to him .",
    "when i first decided to nominate mayo for the henry norris russell prize in 1997 , letters in support of my nomination were received by professors l. spitzer ( princeton university observatory ) , h. vd hulst , g. miley and e. van dishoeck ( at leiden ) , r.j .",
    "allen ( baltimore ) , bruce and debbie elmegreen ( ny ) , d.a .",
    "williams ( university college london ) , p. hodge ( editor of the _ astronomical journal _ in seattle ) and l. allamandola , d. cruikshank and y. pendleton ( nasa - ames ) .",
    "the letters bore stature of the greatness of the man .",
    "sadly , both lyman spitzer and henk vd hulst passed on , shortly after they wrote their recommendation letters .",
    "as fundamental as the hertzsprung - russell diagram is to our understanding of stellar evolution , so pivotal was the pioneering insight of mayo greenberg to our understanding of the chemical composition and evolution of dust grains in our galaxy , and beyond .",
    "the field in which mayo played such an absolutely pioneering , leading role over the decades is now turning out to be one of the _ most rapidly _ developing areas in galactic and extragalactic astrophysics .",
    "not surprising .",
    "the distribution of dust tends to delineate the location of the material for future generations of stars and offers evidence of a history of past stellar processing of the ism and metal enrichment .",
    "as was recognised at our international conference on galaxy morphology and cold dust held at our university in january 1996 ( attended by over 100 astronomers worldwide ) , the predictive powers of mayo s work were absolutely remarkable .",
    "remarkable both in depth , and in originality .",
    "conditions simulated by professor greenberg for the study of the photochemistry of low temperature ices related to the photoprocessing of interstellar dust opened up fundamentally new paths : all of the chemical work that was done on molecules in giant molecular clouds prior to that assumed ion molecule chemistry , absolutely ignoring the fact that there was dust there .",
    "researchers had ignored it from so many points of view , it would be impossible for me to enumerate them .",
    "greenberg s far - reaching insights into the pivotal role which the evolution of dust grains play in our understanding of star formation , are only now being fully appreciated . his now famous silicate core / organic refractory and ice mantle model for dust grains",
    "was developed _",
    "decades _ before the advent of modern ground and space based instruments could test the models .",
    "i think in particular , of the confirmation from spectroscopic studies of the silicate spectral features at 9.7@xmath3 and 18@xmath3 and the 3.4 @xmath3 organic feature in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "but there is more .",
    "dust is swept by stellar winds and explosions into clumps , clouds , shells , and filaments that can collapse to give rise to new stars .",
    "such structure also mitigates the radiative transfer in a galaxy , shielding star forming clouds from photodissociation , or in its absence , leaving clouds mostly dissociated , as dense molecular cores inside large warm atomic shells .",
    "greenberg was the first to _ predict _ , almost 30 years ago , the ` temperature fluctuations ' or ` temperature spiking ' of very small dust grains . again",
    "the master s vision has been soundly confirmed both by further theoretical and observational studies .",
    "there is more .",
    "cold ( 20k and colder ) dust grains , acting as a cosmic mask or fog , may obscure a huge @xmath4 95% mass fraction of pop ii galactic backbones .",
    "significant dust content can play havoc with attempts to accurately measure the light and color distributions in a galaxy , especially if it is embedded as opposed to a foreground screen . moreover , dust can play havoc with inferences for the morphological classification of stellar population ii disks from gaseous population i speciations , on which the hubble tuning fork is based .",
    "a entirely new near - infrared classification scheme emerges when galaxies are _ mask penetrated _ ; the hubble tuning fork strikes a new note .",
    "greenberg was right on target . over three decades ago , he _ predicted _ that 80 - 90 percent of the dust mass in a galaxy would consist of cold and very cold grains ( see his pioneering paper ` interstellar grains and spiral structure ' in the 1970 volume edited by h. habing ) and therefore undetected by iras .",
    "it is precisely these ` large ' ( tenth micron ) grains which are responsible for the visual extinction in galaxies ; not the smaller , one - hundredth micron grains .    in january 1996",
    ", we could all salute the legendary greenberg on the fact that optical minus near infrared imaging combined with radiative transfer codes , _ now beautifully confirmed _ his predictions : dust masses ( and therefore dust - gas ratios ) can increase by one order of magnitude .",
    "interarm dust is everywhere .",
    "[ see the volume which mayo and i edited , entitled _ ` new extragalactic perspectives in the new south africa ' _ , kluwer , 1996 ] .",
    "greenberg s predictions were made some 30 years before 2d direct imaging could routinely become possible longward of i ( 0.89@xmath3 ) .",
    "sub - millimetre / mm observations had brought the issue of cold dust to the fore , but with controversial and diametrically opposed conclusions . quantitative techniques to probe the full spatial extent of dust grains of all temperatures awaited the commissioning ( circa 1990 ) of large format hgcdte nicmos arrays on telescopes at mauna kea and elsewhere .",
    "we generated optical minus near - infrared colour maps to establish the existence , at arcsecond resolution , of a cold and very cold population of ( interarm ) dust , and greenberg s predictions were conclusively verified in 1994 and 1996 .",
    "as i reflect over the publication list of greenberg , i must , in passing , salute the master in a paper co - authored by him in _ nature _",
    ", concerning the possibility of dust grains in in galactic haloes .",
    "4096@xmath124096 pixel ccd imaging of the galaxy ngc5907 with the canada france hawaii telescope suggests  on observational grounds  that dust _ may _ be present in its halo .",
    "colour excesses are at levels of @xmath4 0.1 magnitude for the halo ngc 5907 , comparable to interarm colour excesses one finds in dusty galactic disks ( eg .",
    "ngc4736 ) .",
    "while it remains a great observational challenge to image galactic haloes , greenberg blazed the theoretical trail .",
    "i have only referred to a handful of the implications of the 300 + papers authored by greenberg . in the citation survey conducted by p.c .",
    "van der kruit entitled ` astronomical community in the netherlands ' [ published in the _ quarterly journal of the royal astronomical society _ ( vol .",
    "4 , pg 421 , 1994 ) ] , professor greenberg held the highest number of cited publications of any astronomer in the netherlands for the year 1991 .",
    "no mean achievement for a researcher then at age 70 !",
    "we indeed stand on the shoulders on giants .",
    "thus far , i have only focussed on some of the _ publications _ of greenberg .",
    "i have not alluded to the _ doctoral students _ professor greenberg has mentored ; scientists such as l. dhendecourt who are now , in their master s footsteps , playing crucial roles in our understandings of , for example , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .",
    "neither have i alluded to students who have worked with greenberg in a postdoctoral capacity , and who later went on to establish research groups of the highest calibre .",
    "i think of lou allamandola , for example , who worked as a postdoc in greenberg s laboratory at leiden .",
    "what a fitting way it was to salute the man in 1997 , when i invited astronomers from around the globe to send in their birthday wishes to mayo on his 75th birthday .",
    "scores , dozens , of emails , poured in .",
    "george miley wrote the first congratulatory email :    _ `` your presence during the last two decades has been of immense benefit to the prestige of leiden .",
    "your immense enthusiasm and stimulating attitude to research is a joy to see .",
    "i can not believe that you are three quarters of a century young .",
    "i regard it as a great privilege to have you as a colleague and friend . on behalf of hanneke and myself , happy birthday ! '' _    next followed an email to my office from sir martin rees , astronomer royal .",
    "this message was followed by emails from ron allen , the elmegreens , y. terzian , g. herbig , b. draine , a. li , f. israel , j. mather , and about 100 more researchers .          _",
    "`` ... you never failed to impress me with the breadth and originality of your work .",
    "i also have the fondest memories of viewing halley s comet with you in our back yard .",
    "i wish you and your family many many more happy years .",
    "bruce elmegreen . '' _      _ `` dear mayo : may your life continue to be filled with dust , molecules , and other assorted interstellar debris !",
    "best regards and congratulations on passing the 2.366 @xmath12 @xmath20 @xmath21 milestone , george herbig . '' _      _",
    "`` your visits to finland and your presentations are well remembered + still today  not least the magic tricks you presented to my ( at that time ) small children .",
    "the first international meeting i attended  the interstellar dust conference in jena in 1969 , was organized under your leadership .",
    "ever since then it has always been a great pleasure and inspiration for me meeting you at different places and conferences ... '' _        from founding the microwave scattering laboratory at the rensselaer polytechnic institute in new york , to the laboratory of astrophysics in leiden , we continued to see a man not only characterized by a lifetime of trailblazing research , but there was more . like his beloved hero einstein ,",
    "mayo was , in his chosen field , a giant of a man whose profound _ predictive _ theoretical insights were truly astounding .",
    "as professor john kerridge ( ucsd ) emphasized :    _ `` you have left an indelible and constructive mark in a host of fields , but of course most notably in the relationships between interstellar grains , comets , and primitive solar systems .",
    "like so many others , i have learnt a great deal from your numerous studies in that area ... '' _    mayo was a family man , and naomi was his closest earthly companion .",
    "the love they shared  how they still held hands whilst briskly walking the streets of leiden  are especially etched in my mind .",
    "for me to be included in his innermost circle of galactic research companions was an immense privilege .",
    "when i first met mayo , it seemed as if we had known one another for years .",
    "there was a mutual bond ",
    "a tie of _ extraordinary friendship _ ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the greenberg home on the rhine ... the hospitality which naomi and mayo extended to my wife liz and me at _ morsweg _ over the years can , and will , never be forgotten .",
    "taxis were ` forbidden ' . on my last arrival at schipol airport , to speak at the oort centenary , mayo and naomi were both there to meet me . to quote george miley : their hospitality was _ legendary_.",
    "mayo had an exuberance for life  with a captal l. he loved to live .",
    "he loved to _",
    "encourage_. he visited me in south africa on two occassions ( figures 6 - 11 ) , and we also walked the streets of paris .",
    "we visited the muse rodin together .",
    "he marvelled at camille claudel s onyx and bronze _ la vague _ and at rodin s _ the walking man , the eternal idol , la tour du travail _ and many others .",
    "each visit by him was filled with enough dreams to last for a lifetime .",
    "when we went game viewing in our south african reserves , mayo was always there  right in the front seat of the 4@xmath124 .",
    "his eye , always eager to spot a lion kill ; a herd of elephant ; a stalking cheetah .... at meal time , mayo kept all enthralled .",
    "i recall staying at his home about a year or two before he passed away ... and to see a man , close to 80 , carrying his back - pack , rushing off to catch the train ( en route to the airport ) to yet _ another _ conference abroad , left an indelible impression on me .",
    "there is a lot i will not say , because they are personal memories . but",
    "let me say this : mayo enriched my life .",
    "he encouraged me , never to give up .",
    "he supported every facet of my research .",
    "figure 12 shows but one example .",
    "we probably spoke on the telephone at least twice a month  often much more . if not by phone , we constantly emailed one another .",
    "we thoroughly enjoyed chatting about a huge range of topics , including the magnificent near - infrared spectra of the brown dwarf gliese229b by tom geballe , b.r .",
    "oppenheimer , s.r .",
    "kulkarni and their collaborators ( figure 13 ) .",
    "i had already partly constituted a scientific organising committee to organise a conference here in south africa for mayo s 80th ; much support was received from george miley , francoise combes , johan knapen , duccio macchetto , bruce elmegreen and ken freeman , among others .",
    "but it was not to be .",
    "fortunately george miley , ewine van dishoeck and willem schutte were able to quickly organise a meeting in mayo s honour , in leiden ; mayo was physically still strong enough to attend .",
    "i spoke to mayo in his hospital bed in belgium .",
    "we spoke just before he passed on , at his home in _",
    "morsweg_. he was almost too weak to speak .",
    "but there came the voice , weak but _ still speaking of future research plans and about dust in the high redshift universe_.          in 2004 , we plan to fly out a researcher from abroad to south africa , to deliver a public lecture at our university great hall ( seating capacity , 1000 persons ) in honour of j. mayo greenberg .",
    "the lecture will probably coincide with our international conference _ penetrating masks of cosmic dust : the life duty cycle of bars _ which takes place in june 2004 .",
    "mayo would indeed have returned to south africa , but his health declined so fast . in was in south africa that mayo met the cabinet minister for arts , culture , science and technology , dr ben ngubane ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "dr ngubane is intimately involved with the 10-m southern african large telescope salt being constructed in south africa .",
    "the lecturer need not have personally have worked with professor greenberg , but the theme of the lecture must obviously be one close to one of greenberg s passions  whether it be comets , extrasolar systems , the dusty ism , or the dusty high redshift universe .",
    "interested persons are invited to email one of the authors ( at block@cam.wits.ac.za ) for further information : it is anticipated that one international airfare and local accomodation will be fully paid for .",

    "<S> , we simulate the appearance of spiral galaxies ( 25@xmath1 in angular diameter ) with a class 6 m next generation space telescope ( ngst ) in their dust penetrated restframe k@xmath2 ( 2.1@xmath3 ) regime at redshifts of 0.7 and 1.2 . </S>",
    "<S> pitch angles , robustly derived from their fourier spectra , remain unchanged from the present to when the universe was roughly one half its present age . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a ubiquity of low m ( m=1 or m=2 ) spiral wavelets or modes is maintained in restframe k@xmath2 images at z=0.7 and z=1.2 , fully consistent with k@xmath2 morphologies for spiral galaxies at z @xmath4 0 in our local universe . </S>",
