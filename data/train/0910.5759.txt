    "the study of information theoretic secrecy was initiated by shannon in @xcite . following shannon s work ,",
    "significant contributions were made by wyner @xcite who established the rate - equivocation region of a degraded broadcast channel .",
    "wyner s result was generalized to the case of a general broadcast channel by csiszar and korner @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgence of activity in studying multi - terminal and vector extensions of @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a secure transmission problem from a source coding perspective .",
    "in particular , we first consider a simple setup consisting of four terminals .",
    "terminal @xmath10 ( say alice ) observes an i.i.d .",
    "source @xmath0 which it intends to transmit losslessly to terminal @xmath11 ( say bob ) .",
    "a malicious but passive user ( say eve ) gets to observe the coded output of alice . in other words ,",
    "the communication link between alice and bob is public , i.e. , insecure .",
    "it is clear that since the malicious user gets the same information as the legitimate user , there can not be any positive secret rate of transmission .",
    "on the other hand , if there is a helper , say helen , who observes an i.i.d .",
    "source @xmath2 which is correlated with the source @xmath0 and transmits information over a secure rate - limited link to bob , then one can aim for creating uncertainty at the eavesdropper ( see figure @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , secure links are shown by * bold * lines . ] ) . for the model shown in figure @xmath10 , we completely characterize the rate - equivocation region . from our result , we observe that the classical achievablity scheme of ahlswede and korner @xcite and wyner @xcite for source coding with rate - limited side information is robust in the presence of a passive eavesdropper .",
    "secondly , we consider the model where alice also has access to the coded output of helen and completely characterize the rate - equivocation region .",
    "we will call this model the two - sided helper model ( see figure @xmath11 ) . from our result",
    ", we observe that the availability of additional coded side information at alice allows her to increase uncertainty of the source at eve even though the rate needed by alice to transmit the source losslessly to bob remains the same .",
    "this observation is in contrast with the case of insecure source coding with side information where providing coded side information to alice is of no value @xcite .",
    "we next generalize the setup of figure @xmath11 to the case when there are both secure and insecure rate - limited links from helen and there is additional side information @xmath7 at bob and additional side information @xmath8 at eve . in particular , there is a secure link of capacity @xmath13 , whose output is available at alice and bob and an insecure link , of capacity @xmath14 , whose output is available at all three terminals , i.e. , at alice , bob and eve ( see figure @xmath12 ) .",
    "the presence of both secure and insecure links from helen can be interpreted as a source - coding analogue of a degraded broadcast channel from helen where alice and bob receive both secure and insecure streams @xmath15 and @xmath16 , whereas , eve only receives the insecure stream @xmath16 .",
    "we completely characterize the rate - equivocation region for this model when @xmath17 forms a markov chain .",
    "we explicitly compute the rate - equivocation region for the cases of one - sided helper and two - sided helper for a pair of binary symmetric sources .",
    "we show that having access to helen s coded output at alice yields a strictly larger equivocation than the case of one - sided helper .",
    "the secure source coding setup shown in figure @xmath10 was considered in @xcite where it was also assumed that eve has access to additional correlated side information @xmath8 .",
    "inner and outer bounds for the rate - equivocation region were provided for this setup , which do not match in general .",
    "the rate - equivocation region was completely characterized in @xcite for the case when bob has complete uncoded side information @xmath2 and eve has additional side information @xmath8 .",
    "this result also follows from @xcite where a similar three terminal setup was studied and the maximum uncertainty at eve was characterized under the assumption of no rate constraint in the lossless transmission of the source to bob .",
    "a similar model was also studied in @xcite where bob intends to reconstruct both @xmath0 and @xmath2 losslessly .",
    "it was shown that slepian - wolf type coding suffices for characterizing the rate - equivocation region when the eavesdropper does not have additional correlated side information .",
    "this setup was generalized in @xcite to the case when the eavesdropper has additional side information @xmath8 , and inner and outer bounds were provided , which do not match in general .    in @xcite ,",
    "a multi - receiver secure broadcasting problem was studied , where alice intends to transmit a source @xmath0 to @xmath18 legitimate users .",
    "the @xmath19th user has access to a correlated source @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , for @xmath22 , and the eavesdropper has access to @xmath8 , where @xmath23 , and the noise sequences @xmath24 are mutually independent and also independent of the source @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it was assumed that alice also has access to @xmath25 . for sources with such modulo - additive structure",
    ", it was shown that to maximize the uncertainty at the eavesdropper , alice can not do any better than describing the error sequences @xmath26 to the legitimate users .",
    "this model is related to the two - sided helper model shown in figure @xmath11 ; see section @xmath27 for details .    for the model shown in figure @xmath12 ,",
    "when we set @xmath28 , i.e. , in the absence of helen , we recover the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our result can also be viewed as a generalization of the result obtained in @xcite .    by setting @xmath29 , i.e. , in the absence of the secure rate - limited link ,",
    "the resulting model is related to the model considered in @xcite where the aim is to generate a secret key between two terminals via an insecure rate - limited two - sided helper . in the model studied in this work",
    ", the aim is to securely transmit the source @xmath0 to bob .",
    "note that , when @xmath29 and @xmath30 , both the secret key generation capacity @xcite and secure transmission rate are zero since eve has access to both @xmath16 and @xmath6 along with @xmath8 . on the other hand , in the presence of a secure link ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath31 , even when @xmath30 , we can still create uncertainty at the eavesdropper .",
    "this is possible since helen can choose not to transmit any information on the insecure link and transmit only a coded description of @xmath2 by using the secure link at the rate @xmath13 , which plays the role of a correlated key .",
    "furthermore , being correlated with the source @xmath0 , the coded description of @xmath2 also permits alice to lower the rate of transmission when compared to the case of using an uncorrelated secret key , where alice transmits at a rate @xmath32 .",
    "in section @xmath33 , we present the rate - equivocation region for the case of one - sided helper . we show that slepian - wolf type coding alone at alice is optimal for this case .",
    "we present the rate - equivocation region for the case of two - sided helper in section @xmath27 . for the case of two - sided helper",
    ", alice uses a conditional rate - distortion code to create an auxiliary @xmath34 from the source @xmath35 and the coded output @xmath36 received from helen .",
    "this code construction is reminiscent of lossy - source coding with two - sided helper @xcite,@xcite , @xcite . for the case of lossy source coding , a conditional rate - distortion code",
    "is used where @xmath34 is selected to satisfy the distortion criterion . on the other hand ,",
    "the purpose of @xmath34 in secure lossless source coding is to confuse the eavesdropper . from this result , we demonstrate the insufficiency of slepian - wolf type coding at alice by explicitly utilizing the side information at alice .",
    "this observation is further highlighted in section @xmath37 where we compare the rate - equivocation regions of two - sided helper and one - sided helper cases for a pair of binary symmetric sources .",
    "for this example , we show that for all @xmath38 , the information leakage to the eavesdropper for the two - sided helper is strictly less than the case of one - sided helper .",
    "we finally generalize the result of two - sided helper to the case when there are both secure and insecure rate - limited links from the two - sided helper and additional side informations @xmath39 and @xmath40 , at bob and eve , respectively .",
    "the presence of secure and insecure rate - limited links from helen can be viewed as a source - coding analogue of a degraded broadcast channel from helen to ( alice , bob ) and eve .",

    "we remark here that the proof of converse for theorem @xmath11 is closely related to the proof of the converse of the rate - distortion function with a two - sided helper @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the achievability scheme which yields the rate region described in theorem @xmath11 is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "helen uses a rate - distortion code to describe the correlated source @xmath62 to both bob and alice through a coded output @xmath36 .",
    "2 .   using the coded output @xmath36 and the source @xmath35",
    ", alice jointly quantizes @xmath69 to an auxiliary random variable @xmath34 .",
    "she subsequently performs wyner - ziv coding , i.e. , bins the @xmath34 sequences at the rate @xmath70 such that bob can decode @xmath34 by using the side information @xmath36 from helen .",
    "alice also bins the source @xmath35 at a rate @xmath71 so that having access to @xmath72 , bob can correctly decode the source @xmath35 .",
    "the total rate used by alice is @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the main difference between the achievability schemes for theorems @xmath10 and @xmath11 is at the encoding at alice and decoding at bob .",
    "also note that selecting a constant @xmath34 in theorem @xmath11 corresponds to slepian - wolf type coding at alice which resulted in an equivocation of @xmath74 in theorem @xmath10 .",
    "we will show in the next section through an example that the uncertainty about the source at eve for the case of two - sided helper can be strictly larger than the case of one - sided helper and selecting @xmath34 as a constant is clearly suboptimal .",
    "besides reflecting the fact that the uncertainty at eve can be strictly larger than the case of a one - sided helper , theorem @xmath11 has another interesting interpretation .",
    "if alice and helen can use sufficiently large rates to securely transmit the source @xmath0 to bob , then the helper can simply transmit a secret key of entropy @xmath32 to both alice and bob .",
    "alice can then use this secret key to losslessly transmit the source to bob in perfect secrecy by using a one - time pad @xcite .",
    "in other words , when @xmath1 and @xmath3 are larger than @xmath32 , one can immediately obtain this result from theorem @xmath11 by selecting @xmath36 to be independent of @xmath75 and uniformly distributed on @xmath76 .",
    "finally , selecting @xmath77 , we observe that @xmath78 , yielding perfect secrecy .",
    "we note that , here , @xmath36 plays the role of a secret key .",
    "now consider the model where the side information @xmath2 is of the form @xmath79 , where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , assume that the side information @xmath2 is available to both alice and bob in an uncoded manner .",
    "for this model , it follows from @xcite that , to maximize the uncertainty at the eavesdropper , alice can not do any better than describing the error sequence @xmath81 to bob .",
    "note that our two - sided helper model differs from this model in two aspects : first , in our case , the common side information available to alice and bob is coded and rate - limited , secondly , the sources in our model do not have to be in modulo - additive form .",
    "our encoding scheme at alice for the case of two - sided helper comprises of two steps : ( a ) using the coded side information @xmath36 and the source @xmath35 , alice creates @xmath34 and transmits the bin index of @xmath34 at a rate @xmath70 so that bob can estimate @xmath34 using @xmath36 , and , ( b ) alice bins the source @xmath35 at a rate @xmath71 and transmits the bin index of the source @xmath35 . note that if for a pair of sources @xmath75 , the optimal @xmath36 is of the form @xmath82 , where @xmath80 and @xmath83 is independent of @xmath35 , then it suffices to choose @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in other words , for such sources ,",
    "step ( b ) in our achievability scheme is not necessary , which is similar to the achievability for the case of modulo - additive sources in @xcite . on the other hand , for a general pair of sources @xmath75",
    ", the optimal @xmath36 may not be of the form @xmath82 and the optimal @xmath34 may not always satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , we need the step ( b ) for our achievability scheme .",
    "this differentiates our achievable scheme from that of @xcite , which holds for modulo - additive sources with uncoded side information .",
    "also note that if @xmath2 is not of the form @xmath87 , and if @xmath88 , then helen can transmit a secret key which will enable perfectly secure transmission of @xmath0 by using a one - time pad @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon does not always occur when the side information @xmath2 is available to both alice and bob in an uncoded fashion @xcite .",

    ", we can observe a trade - off in the amount of information alice needs to send versus the uncertainty at eve .",
    "for small values of @xmath3 , alice needs to send more information thereby leaking out more information to eve .",
    "the amount of information leaked is exactly the information sent by alice . on the other hand , for the case of two - sided helper , the uncertainty at the eavesdropper is always strictly larger than the uncertainty in the one - sided case .",
    "also note that for this pair of sources , perfect secrecy is possible for the case of two - sided helper when @xmath115 which is not possible for the case of one - sided helper .",
