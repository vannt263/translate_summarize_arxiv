    "this paper has two main goals .",
    "the first one is to exhibit an explicit family of quadratic polynomial maps in dimension three ( center unstable hnon - like families ) with blenders .",
    "the second one is to prove the occurrence of blenders near certain non - transverse heterodimensional cycles and the connections between them under high regularity assumptions .",
    "the two previous results are related as follows : associated to the non - transverse heterodimensional cycles there are renormalization schemes converging to center unstable hnon - like families .",
    "we now briefly discuss the three main topics of this paper : blenders , non - transverse heterodimensional cycles , and renormalization . in what follows",
    "we assume that the dimension of the ambient space is three .",
    "_ blenders _ ( see definition  [ d.blender ] ) only appear in dimension greater than or equal to @xmath0 and are just a special type of hyperbolic sets @xmath1 of diffeomorphisms @xmath2 which are maximal invariant in a neighborhood @xmath3 , that is , @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the case where the stable direction is one - dimensional .",
    "then the blender @xmath1 has a dominated splitting with three hyperbolic directions ( the stable , the center unstable , and the strong unstable directions ) .",
    "a key property of a blender is its internal dynamical configuration that implies that every curve which crosses a distinctive open region of @xmath3 and is almost tangent to the one - dimensional strong unstable direction intersects the local stable manifold of @xmath1 .",
    "this roughly means that @xmath1 topologically behaves as a hyperbolic set with stable manifold of dimension two .",
    "another relevant property of a blender is its robustness : for diffeomorphisms @xmath5 near @xmath2 the continuation of the hyperbolic set @xmath1 for @xmath5 is also a blender .",
    "a blender is an important ingredient for obtaining robust non - hyperbolic dynamics : blenders play a similar role as the thick horseshoes introduced by newhouse @xcite .",
    "they are used to turn heterodimensional cycles and homoclinic tangencies @xmath6-robust , see @xcite .",
    "we remark that recently some authors have introduced blenders whose center unstable direction is indecomposable and has dimension @xmath7 , see @xcite .",
    "we study how blenders occur .",
    "as far as we know , their construction involves series of perturbations which are genuinely @xmath8 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we present an explicit family of quadratic maps ( which we call a _ center unstable hnon - like family _ ) with blenders .",
    "a novelty here is that the blenders are obtained without perturbations and their occurrence only involves an appropriate selection of parameters of the family .",
    "[ thm.main2 ] consider the center unstable hnon - like family @xmath9 there is an open set @xmath10 of parameters @xmath11 such that any diffeomorphism @xmath12 @xmath13-close to @xmath14 with @xmath15 has a blender .",
    "one important feature of the family ( [ e.henonfamily ] ) is the existence of the term @xmath16 in the @xmath17-component .",
    "this term gives us a superposition property ( see definition  [ d.blender ] ) of the hyperbolic set which enables us to obtain the blender , compare the family treated in @xcite .",
    "homoclinic tangencies and hnon - like dynamics are in the core of the so - called _ critical dynamics _ , while heterodimensional cycles are genuine bifurcations of _ non - critical dynamics _ , for more details see preface of @xcite .",
    "there are many cases where the effects of the critical and the non - critical dynamics overlap : the system has a critical region and a non - critical one and there are transitions between these two regions .",
    "we study such kind of configuration in dimension three : diffeomorphisms having two saddles of different _ indices _ ( dimension of the unstable direction ) whose invariant manifolds are cyclically related by a heterodimensional cycle with non - transverse heteroclinic intersections .",
    "this configuration ( depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] ) is called a _",
    "non - transverse heterodimensional cycle _ : the two invariant manifolds of dimension one meet quasi - transversally and the two - dimensional ones have a tangential intersection .",
    "the dynamics close to the saddles and the quasi - transverse heteroclinic intersection provide the non - critical part of the dynamics , while the critical one is given by the heteroclinic tangency .    the non - transverse cycle that we consider contains a heterodimensional tangency . in the @xmath6 case",
    ", it is known that the unfolding of these tangencies leads to robustly non - dominated dynamics and in some cases to very intermingled dynamics related to universal dynamics introduced in @xcite , see @xcite for detail . in the @xmath18 case ,",
    "the non - transverse cycles are _ not _ special in the following sense : there exists @xmath19 open setw of @xmath20-dimensional ( @xmath21 ) diffeomorphisms having heterodimensional tangencies in a coindex-@xmath22 heterodimensional cycle , see @xcite .",
    "note that the occurence of @xmath19 newhouse phenomenon and strange attractors were observed in @xcite .    using theorem  [ thm.main2 ] and the renormalization scheme that we will present below ,",
    "we prove the existence of blenders near some of these non - transverse heterodimensional cycles under high regularity assumptions , see corollary  [ cor.kiriki ] .",
    "let us observe that by adjusting the parameters , we can obtain convergence of the renormalization to different types of hnon - like maps , see the comment after theorem  [ thm.main1 ] .",
    "this illustrates the richness of the dynamics near these cycles .",
    "renormalization means providing a sequence of local coordinate changes near a tangency point and reparametrizations , which gives a sequence of return maps along heteroclinic orbits converging to a limit map with interesting dynamics . using a renormalization scheme one can translate relevant properties of the limit maps to some diffeomorphisms close to the one with the tangency .",
    "renormalization methods play an important role in the study of homoclinic bifurcations ( dynamics at homoclinic tangencies ) .",
    "this method leads to the approximation of the dynamics by quadratic families and allows to translate properties of such families ( such as existence of strange attractors and sinks , or thick hyperbolic sets ) to properties of the diffeomorphisms , see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) .",
    "so far , renormalizations have not been sufficiently exploited in the context of heterodimensional bifurcations .",
    "we consider renormalization schemes for non - transverse heterodimensional cycles .",
    "depending on the conditions satisfied by the diffeomorphism , this renormalization may converge to different types of dynamics .",
    "we wonder if this limit map may exhibit blenders . in general",
    ", it is not always the case .",
    "we prove that , under some ( degenerate ) conditions , the renormalization converges to the center unstable hnon - like families in theorem  [ thm.main2 ] , see theorem  [ thm.main1 ] .",
    "we now state precise definitions and results .",
    "consider diffeomorphisms @xmath2 defined on a closed three - dimensional manifold @xmath23 having hyperbolic periodic points @xmath24 and @xmath25 of saddle type with different _ indices _ ( dimension of the unstable bundle and denoted by @xmath26 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 has a _ non - transverse heterodimensional cycle _ associated to the saddles @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( assume that @xmath27 ) .",

    "that is , there is @xmath29 such that @xmath30 and the two - dimensional manifolds @xmath31 and @xmath32 have a non - transverse intersection ( a tangency ) along the orbit of a point @xmath33 .",

    "associated to the heteroclinic point @xmath34 , there is a transition from a neighborhood @xmath35 of @xmath25 to a neighborhood @xmath36 of @xmath24 following the orbit of @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , associated to @xmath33 there is a transition from @xmath36 to @xmath35 , see also figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we impose some conditions to these transitions in equation .",

    "starting from a six - parameter family of diffeomorphisms ( where the parameters describe the position of the continuations of the heteroclinic points above ) , we select a two - parameter sub - family converging to a hnon - like family : there is a renormalization scheme near the tangency providing a sequence of maps @xmath49 , reparametrizations @xmath50 , and parameters @xmath51 such that the family converges to a hnon - like family .",

    "the convergence in the @xmath642 topology is easy to see . to see the @xmath95 convergence , we only need to check the @xmath95 smallness of each partial derivative of @xmath643 for large @xmath20 . by the symmetry , we only confirm for @xmath644 ( partial derivative of @xmath643 with respect to @xmath17 ) and omit the check for @xmath645 and @xmath646 .",
    "let us confirm the smallness of @xmath99-hlder constant for large @xmath20 .",
    "given @xmath649 , @xmath650 , we have @xmath651 in the last formula , @xmath652 converges to zero as @xmath632 if @xmath653 , and the absolute value of the rest of the formula is bounded by the hlder constant of @xmath654 , which does not depend on @xmath20 and @xmath649 .",

    "this implies that the point @xmath663 is outside the support of the perturbation .    to see this",
    ", we take the quotient of these two quantities : @xmath670 if @xmath668 is bounded , then by taking sufficiently large @xmath447 and @xmath20 , one can check that the last term lies in the interval @xmath671 , which completes the proof .      the perturbation above keeps @xmath672 intact .",

    "hence , proposition  [ prop.sec5-prop1 ] implies that in the perturbed system the unstable manifold @xmath684 has non - empty intersection with the superposition region of the blender @xmath87 as a vertical segment for sufficiently large @xmath504 .",
    "this concludes theorem  [ thm.main3 ] .      the proof is obtained by similar calculations in theorem [ thm.main1]-(2 ) . in the following , we give explicit calculations of image of two segments with respect to @xmath505-coordinate and prove the smallness of the @xmath6 distance of these two segments .",
    "since the coordinate change @xmath685 is bounded ( independent of @xmath447 and @xmath20 ) , it implies the @xmath6 smallness of the difference of two segments in the @xmath681-coordinate .",
