    "it is very difficult to describe full electron correlations due to a number of complex phenomena related to the quantum character of the electron .",
    "it is hence appropriate to approach the full description of electron correlations iteratively in several stages .",
    "the first one is the static mean - field approximation of the hartree type .",
    "such a mean - field theory completely neglects both charge and spin fluctuations and reduces the interacting system to a fermi gas with renormalized , self - consistently determined , densities .",
    "such a simplification may deliver reliable results only for macroscopic static quantities in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "electron correlations in this approximation have no impact on dynamical and transport properties .    the next level in a comprehensive modeling of strong electron correlations are models and approximations allowing for charge fluctuations . in these models",
    "the spin of electrons does not play a significant role and electrons are subjected only to a potential scattering .",
    "it means that electrons are only scattered on fluctuations of the atomic potential in the lattice .",
    "the potential fluctuations are caused by impurities that may be distributed in the crystal either regularly or randomly .",
    "the paradigm for the former situation is the falicov - kimball model@xcite ( fkm ) and for the latter the anderson model of disordered electrons ( dam).@xcite unlike the static mean - field approximations , the models with a potential scattering lead to quantum dynamical effects and are applicable to the entire range of the interaction strength ( variance of the potential fluctuations ) .",
    "the potential scattering does consequently affect spectral and transport properties of the system .",
    "a common feature of the models with potential scatterings only is that energy is conserved during scattering events and need not be treated as a dynamical variable .",
    "each energy , however , is renormalized in a different manner and hence the energy ( frequency ) is used as an external label .",
    "conservation of energy in scattering events is a significant simplification in the description of electron correlations .",
    "it allows for an exact solution in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions ( dynamical mean - field theory ) , where the effect of strong potential fluctuations may be studied without uncontrolled approximations.@xcite    the two models , fkm and dam , are standardly used for different purposes .",
    "the former one is aimed at a description of quantum fluctuations caused by electron correlations in thermally equilibrated states , while the latter one was introduced so that a response of a disordered electron gas to weak electromagnetic non - equilibrium perturbations can be estimated in a controlled way .",
    "both the models have served well their original purposes .",
    "the falicov - kimball model has been successfully applied to a simplified description of correlation - induced metal - insulator@xcite and valence - change@xcite transitions in rare - earth compounds , or atoms in optical lattices.@xcite the disordered anderson model has been used to describe the spectral and transport properties of metallic alloys@xcite and vanishing of diffusion , called anderson localization.@xcite there have been efforts to describe the combined effect of electron correlations and randomness in the disordered falicov - kimball model@xcite or anderson localization in fkm.@xcite only a few attempts have , however , been made in the calculation of the response of fkm to non - equilibrium perturbations beyond the mean - field approach.@xcite in particular , it is little known about the electrical conductivity of fkm beyond the mean - field , drude contribution.@xcite    it is the aim of this paper to fill up this gap and to propose a systematic way how to calculate vertex corrections to the drude ( mean - field ) electrical conductivity in models with elastic scatterings only , that is fkm , dam or a disordered fkm .",
    "the method we use is an expansion around the mean - field solution obtained from the asymptotic limit to high spatial dimensions .",
    "we calculate the leading - order vertex correction in high spatial dimensions being of order @xmath0 , while the drude conductivity is of order @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrate that the vertex corrections have a universal behavior for all models of elastically scattered electrons and are always negative , independent of whether they are caused by an external random potential ( quenched randomness ) or by static , thermally equilibrated electron correlations ( annealed randomness ) .",
    "elastic scatterings of electrons are caused by either internal or external fluctuations of atomic potentials of frozen ions forming a crystalline lattice .",
    "that is , interactions of electrons of the same sort are excluded in models with elastic scatterings .",
    "they are actually forbidden in spinless models with locally interacting fermions .",
    "these models hence contain either more than one type of electrons or an externally governed distribution of atomic potentials .",
    "we consider only the elementary version of such models and take into account only two types of electrons , extended and localized ones .",
    "we further assume homogeneity in the distribution of the localized electrons and hence the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian describing such a situation reads    [ eq : fk - hamiltonian ] @xmath2 we are interested in dynamical properties of the delocalized electrons induced by fluctuations of the atomic potential the extended electrons feel . to this purpose",

    ", one has to consider the full representation of the vertex correction from eq .   containing the cooper pole .",
    "only then we are able to include a sizable impact of spatial dimensionality .",
    "the method for evaluating vertex corrections to the mean - field electrical conductivity via an asymptotic expansion in high spatial dimensions is universal and is suitable for any model with elastically scattered electrons .",
    "we can hence use it to investigate whether the coulomb interaction in fkm can lead to suppression of diffusion in low - dimensional systems as well as to study an interplay between the anderson localization and mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition in the disordered falicov - kimball model .",
