    "strong astrophysical shocks are widely believed to be the sites where the cosmic rays ( crs ) are born .",
    "although the test particle calculation of the cr spectrum is straightforward ( krimsky 1977 ; axford , leer & skadron 1977 ; bell 1978 ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) , the acceleration efficiency , in other words the fraction of incoming flow energy that is converted into cr - gas internal energy , can not be obtained within this theory .",
    "there are two major problems associated with diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "first of all even in the simplest test particle theory a self - similar power - law solution , isotropic to lowest order , is possible only at sufficiently large momenta where the solution is independent of any momentum scale and depends only on the shock compression ratio .",
    "thus , some difficulty in this description occurs already at lower energies where the thermal and the bulk flow velocity may enter the solution . consequently , the amplitude of this power - law spectrum is virtually unknown .",
    "it is therefore necessary to calculate , first of all , the injection rate , i.e. the number of particles that feed the acceleration process . injection is believed to operate at the plasma subshock .",
    "surprisingly , until recently there were no attempts to attack the injection problem analytically . at the same time this problem was studied numerically ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and phenomenologically ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in great detail and from different points of view . given the subshock strength and in terms of the parameterized distribution of thermal particles leaking into the upstream region from downstream , the injection rate has been calculated analytically by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of these leaking ( and/or directly from the shock front reflected ) ions that is crucial for the injection theory is in turn a problem of its own in collisionless shock physics ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it almost certainly depends on shock parameters like the orientation of the magnetic field , the ratio of upstream thermal and magnetic pressures , the mach number , etc .",
    "one simplified formulation of this formidable task that also allows one to calculate this distribution in a closed form , suitable for injection , has been suggested by this author ( @xcite , m96 hereafter ) for a parallel shock , where the direction of the shock normal and the magnetic field coincide . for other types of shocks",
    "the question is unsolved .",
    "it may be said then that the injection problem in general has become more a problem of the shock dissipation mechanism , rather than the problem of shock acceleration .",
    "it is however also true as we shall see in the sequel that these two latter aspects of collisionless shock theory can not be treated independently .",
    "the second major problem , the impact of the accelerated high - energy particles on the acceleration process itself may be even more dramatic . while the injection rate can be calculated given the subshock conditions , even though subject to the above limitations , and the actual subshock strength can be determined afterwards ( when the pressure of accelerated particles is finally obtained , see appendix a ) , the calculation of the spectrum of dynamically important high - energy particles should be intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "the reason is that the energetic particles can significantly modify the flow structure over a large spatial scale @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the momentum dependent diffusion coefficient ( in the bohm limit one has @xmath19 ) . here",
    "@xmath20 is the upper cut - off momentum and @xmath21 is the flow speed far upstream .",
    "hence particles with different energies `` see '' different shock compression .",
    "moreover , they produce the gradient of the flow velocity by themselves , and therefore couple the length scale with the momentum scale .",
    "this means that a momentum scale - free particle spectrum is no longer possible unless the velocity profile is also scale invariant .",
    "since in a strongly modified high mach number shock the total compression ratio exceeds the conventional value of ` four ' markedly , the partial pressure of stationary accelerated particles becomes a nonintegrable function of momentum without an upper momentum cut - off .",
    "therefore , in reality the steady state acceleration along with the underlying flow structure will critically depend on the losses at the upper cut - off momentum @xmath20 or , more precisely , they will be determined by the balance between these losses and the injection around some slightly suprathermal momenta @xmath22 ( see appendix a ) . moreover , these losses have the effect of increasing the total compression ratio , boosting cr production even further .",
    "one sees that also the form of the spectrum obtained within the test particle theory is dubious since the backreaction of accelerated particles on the flow is significant .    in this paper",
    "we present a solution of the following problem .",
    "consider a strong , stationary , plane shock , propagating at the mach number @xmath23 .",
    "suprathermal particles are steadily injected at the subshock and are then partly accelerated up to the cut - off momentum @xmath24 . to be determined ( as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath4 ) are : ( i ) the spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "( ii ) the flow profile across the shock @xmath25 .",
    "the latter implies the total compression ratio and thus the acceleration efficiency , again as function of @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "of particular interest are the question of the uniqueness of the solution , and the strength of the subshock .",
    "physically , the injection rate @xmath2 does not belong to the input parameters which are merely @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "it can be calculated selfconsistently with the help of ( mv95 , m96 , and @xcite , ( mv97 ) ) , given the subshock strength to be obtained below . nevertheless , under certain restrictions explained in appendix",
    "a , injection can be treated independently of the large - scale shock modification studied in this paper .",
    "we will pursue this approach in what follows , considering @xmath2 as another input parameter .",
    "there is no necessity to stress that this paper is not the first one to attack the problem of nonlinear shock acceleration analytically . besides the well known two - fluid and three - fluid approximations introduced by axford , leer , & skadron ( 1977 ) , drury & vlk ( 1981 ) , and , including the scattering wave field , by @xcite on the one hand , and the perturbative kinetic studies performed by blandford ( 1980 ) and heavens ( 1983 ) on the other , there exist a few separable solutions based on rather special assumptions about the functional dependence of @xmath26 ( drury , axford & summers 1982 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative treatment was suggested by eichler ( 1979 , 1984 ) .",
    "the key step of his approach consists in replacing the true solution of the diffusion - convection equation ad hoc by a heaviside function which is coordinate independent up to some distance @xmath27 upstream and is zero beyond it .",
    "unfortunately , such a ` weak solution ' does not satisfy the convection diffusion equation which may be proven by substitution .",
    "physically there is indeed no other scale height upstream for the energetic particles than the diffusion length @xmath28 which could justify the introduction of a step - like behavior of the particle distribution .",
    "the width of the transition zone between the spectrum downstream and its far upstream ( zero ) limit increases with @xmath29 exactly as does the length parameter @xmath27 where the spectrum supposedly vanishes abruptly in eichler s model . as it was pointed out by eichler ( 1984 )",
    ", such a behaviour of the solution would be possible if @xmath26 were extremely large for @xmath30 and zero otherwise .",
    "therefore , this solution belongs also to the category of solutions that require very special form of diffusion coefficient @xmath31 .",
    "there is no physical reason , however , to ascribe such a property to the cr diffusivity .    notwithstanding the above criticism",
    ", the approach developed by eichler contains the fruitful idea of ` algebraization ' of the problem . in other words",
    ", it offers a way to reduce the number of independent variables by the introduction of some functional link between the @xmath32 and @xmath29 variables through a special boundary @xmath33 in phase space . in addition , the issue of interrelation between injection and losses and their critical influence on the shock formation and acceleration efficiency was first addressed by eichler ( 1979 , 1984 ) . in principle",
    "some form of algebraization seems to be necessary for a successful analytic treatment .",
    "otherwise computer studies will remain the only possibility to explore this difficult problem .",
    "in contrast to eichler we derive an algebraization that is based on the powerful technique of integral transforms .",
    "we shall focus predominantly on the so called efficient solution ( fig.1 ) , in which almost all the shock energy is converted into cr - gas internal energy .",
    "its relation to the inefficient , test - particle solution is the subject of a companion paper ( paper ii ) . by an extension of the technique developed below , we present in paper ii a unified description of all three solutions along with the corresponding bifurcation analysis .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.2",
    "we introduce the necessary equations and discuss some of the basic approximations used in the further analysis . in sec.3",
    "we find a formal solution for the particle distribution in the shock precursor , that depends on the unknown postshock spectrum and on the hydrodynamic velocity in the shock transition .",
    "we introduce a spectral function that couples the thermal gas with the energetic particles and plays a central role in the analysis . in sec.4",
    "we derive equations for the spectral function and for the hydrodynamic flow , investigate analytic properties of the spectral function and solve the equation for it . sec.5",
    "deals with the flow profile . in sec.6",
    "the particle spectrum is restored .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in sec.7 .",
    "consider a strong cr - modified shock propagating in the positive @xmath34-direction in a cold medium with the gas kinetic pressure @xmath35 and the mass density @xmath36 . in the shock frame of reference the steady mass flow profile is defined as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ( constant ) downstream mass velocity , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , as @xmath41 .",
    "the isotropic part of the particle distribution at sufficiently high momenta , and for all @xmath34 , is governed by the well known diffusion - convection equation ( parker 1965 ; gleeson & axford 1967 ) @xmath42 here the number density of crs is normalized to @xmath43 , @xmath44 denotes the particle diffusion coefficient that is assumed to be a monotonically increasing function of momentum @xmath29 . to be specific",
    ", we will assume that @xmath45 .",
    "for @xmath46 the solution to eq.([c : d : p ] ) is taken to be @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "satisfies the equation @xmath50 which should be solved together with the conditions of overall mass and momentum conservation @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the mass density , @xmath53 is the specific heat ratio of the thermal plasma , @xmath54 is the cr pressure @xmath55 and no seed particles are present , i.e. @xmath56 . the particle momentum @xmath29 is normalized to @xmath57 .",
    "we regard as crs all the particles that occupy the region in momentum space between the injection momentum @xmath58 and the cut - off momentum @xmath4 , and we assume that @xmath59 .",
    "in bernoulli s integral ( [ m : c : p ] ) we have isolated the contribution of suprathermal particles @xmath60 that do not belong to the thermal upstream gas and should rather be regarded as a low - energy part of the crs .",
    "these particles appear just upstream from the gaseous subshock as a product of thermal leakage from the downstream medium and have practically nothing to do with the adiabatically compressed upstream thermal plasma represented by the last term on the l.h.s . in eq.([m : c : p ] ) ( see appendix a ) . in view of the astrophysical significance of strong shocks , we focus on the high mach number limit . for simplicity",
    "we confine our consideration to the case in which not only @xmath61 but also @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "thus eq.([m : c : p ] ) rewrites @xmath64 one remark should be made concerning the approximation in eq.([m : c ] ) .",
    "namely , we neglected the gas pressure by virtue of assumption ( [ nu ] ) , comparing it with the ram pressure @xmath65 .",
    "if the shock is significantly modified by crs , one should compare the gas pressure with @xmath66 instead and the condition may become more stringent , @xmath67",
    ". however , this may potentially be important only close to the subshock where also the @xmath68-term may be important , and the problem can hardly be resolved without turning to the subshock internal structure itself .",
    "we will specify the corresponding length scale and discuss the validity of eq.([m : c ] ) in appendix c , after the flow structure is determined .",
    "the last equation we need is that for the gaseous subshock , in which equation we neglect the energy losses from the gas due to injection : @xmath69 it is important to note that the subshock can still be diminished significantly due to the cr pressure and at least formally can even be smeared out completely when @xmath70 , without violating our assumption ( [ nu ] ) . to summarize , eqs.([c : d],[c : e],[m : c ] ) , and ( [ c : r ] ) form the basis for the further analysis .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to gain enough information about the solution of the diffusion - convection equation ( [ c : d ] ) without specifying the flow profile @xmath25 . to this end",
    "we will use the flow potential @xmath71 as a new independent spatial variable instead of @xmath32 . but",
    "first , we transform eq.([c : d ] ) to the following integro - differential equation @xmath72      \\label{c : d : i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once the solution of this equation is found in terms of the unknown downstream spectrum @xmath73 , the latter can also be determined from the equation immediately following from eq.([c : d ] ) @xmath74 one sees that iterates @xmath75 of eq.([c : d : i ] ) , starting with @xmath76 yield a uniformly valid expansion in the case @xmath77 ( weak modification ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath78 is already a good approximation in this case .",
    "let us start our consideration of the strongly modified shock from the region @xmath79 .",
    "substituting @xmath80 into the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([c : d : i ] ) we can generate a formal neuman series in @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , calculating the internal integral by parts and retaining formally only the leading term in @xmath82 , as a first iteration we get @xmath83 where @xmath84 to the same order in @xmath81 we can rewrite @xmath85 in the same form as @xmath78 , but with a renormalized diffusion coefficient @xmath86 since @xmath87 may be rather small numerically , ( for the test particle solution with the compression ratio @xmath88 , one obtains @xmath89 ) and because @xmath78 provides a correct asymptotic behavior of the solution of eq.([c : d ] ) for @xmath90 , one may conjecture that the solution in the form of eq.([ren : g ] ) is also good for larger values of @xmath81 . that this is true ,",
    "is demonstrated in appendix b. therefore , we may take @xmath91 as a formal solution to the diffusion - convection equation .",
    "the function @xmath92 , or equivalently , @xmath87 is yet to be obtained from eq.([b : c ] ) whereas the function @xmath93 must come from the bernoulli s integral ( [ m : c ] ) .",
    "the solution ( [ c : d : sol ] ) is valid for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and its region of validity has , in fact , also a lower bound given by eq.([l : ineq ] ) ( see appendix b ) .",
    "as it will be shown later , this restriction concerns only a very small region at the origin for the solutions of interest .",
    "clearly , this may be important for @xmath96 at small @xmath97 but not for @xmath98 itself since the latter is continuous at @xmath99 .",
    "thus , some care should be exercised in calculating the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([b : c ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to rewrite this equation with the help of eq.([c : d : i ] ) as @xmath100 this equation can also be derived directly from eq.([c : d ] ) by means of integration over @xmath32 between @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( eichler 1979 ) .",
    "in contrast to eq.([b : c ] ) it does not contain the uncertain spatial derivative of the solution at the origin and we may substitute the solution ( [ c : d : sol ] ) into eq.([eich : eq ] ) which yields @xmath103 here we have introduced the function @xmath104 that will play a central role in our further analysis @xmath105      \\label{v}\\ ] ] this function reflects explicitly a degree of shock modification . in an unmodified shock @xmath106 , since then @xmath107 in the upstream region ; the spectral index @xmath108 is just the conventional @xmath109 , ( see eq.([g0 ] ) ) .",
    "in general @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath112 . even if the shock is appreciably modified , one may show ( appendix c ) that at small @xmath113 @xmath114 and @xmath115 may be neglected in eq.([g0 ] ) .",
    "the spectral index then corresponds simply to the subshock compression ratio , and at lower momenta we have @xmath116 the injection solution ( appendix a ) produces essentially the same asymptotic result for @xmath117 , yielding thus the injection rate @xmath118 . the solution @xmath73 can be obtained then for all @xmath119 using eq.([g0 ] ) . to this end",
    "an independent equation for @xmath120 should be derived .",
    "this will be done in the next section .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the function @xmath121 , that we term the spectral function , is directly related to the spectral slope through eq.([g0 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath121 were defined as an integral starting at @xmath101 , the subshock jump would also be incorporated into the spectral function as a point set component of the measure @xmath25 in the integral ( [ v ] ) .",
    "we will use this ` full ' spectral function occasionally , denoting it by @xmath122 .",
    "we emphasize that in addition to the link with the particle spectrum , this function contains all the information about the hydrodynamic flow structure . indeed , introducing a new variable @xmath123 the function @xmath115 can be recast as the laplace - stieltjes transform of the flow velocity @xmath124 @xmath125 that maps @xmath124 onto @xmath126 , or in other words , @xmath115 provides the spectral representation of the flow @xmath124 in terms of the particle momentum @xmath29 by virtue of eqs.([s],[v : l ] ) .",
    "yet another interpretation of @xmath121 is that a particle with momentum @xmath127 samples the flow compression @xmath128 upstream , where @xmath129 is defined by the relation @xmath130 .    after these short remarks concerning the usefulness of the spectral function @xmath115 for describing the cr - gas coupling",
    ", we note that the only equation available to derive an equation for @xmath115 is the bernoulli s integral ( [ m : c ] ) .",
    "using eq.([c : d : sol ] ) the latter can be rewritten as @xmath131 where @xmath132+\\frac{p_{\\rm inj}}{\\rho _ 1 u_1 }      \\label{fb}\\ ] ] here the injection rate is given by @xmath133 and @xmath134 denotes the number density of the crs .",
    "the low energy asymptotics of @xmath135 is now fixed by @xmath136 , i.e @xmath137 ( see eq.([low : m ] ) ) .",
    "we will omit the tilde sign in what follows .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is regarded as a known function of the subshock parameters , that can be inferred from the injection theory mv95 , m96 , mv97 .",
    "for @xmath138 the pressure integral ( [ fb ] ) is cut by the exponent at small @xmath139 .",
    "this means that starting from some @xmath140 the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.([fb ] ) becomes virtually independent of @xmath58 since , due to the normalization @xmath141 , the function @xmath142 depends also on @xmath58 in such a way that @xmath143 is @xmath58-invariant . for smaller @xmath97 ( @xmath144 ) only the sum of the two terms on the left hand side ( l.h.s . )",
    "is independent of @xmath58 and the contribution @xmath145 that has the same scale in @xmath97 might be important .",
    "this is , however , a very small region compared to the total precursor height @xmath146 , in the case of strongly modified shocks we are interested in .",
    "therefore we may ignore here this region and omit the term @xmath147 .",
    "taking the @xmath148 derivative of eq.([m : c : f ] ) , multiplying the result by @xmath149 and integrating with respect to @xmath32 we get @xmath150 returning to the momentum @xmath29 ( eq.([s ] ) ) , for efficient solutions from ( [ fb ] ) we obtain @xmath151 ( note that for inefficient , weakly modified solutions , the function @xmath152 should be set to @xmath153 in accordance with eq.([g : unm ] ) , instead of eq.([s ] ) . ) resolving eq.([g0 ] ) for @xmath142 and using the normalization @xmath141 in place of the last equation we obtain the following equation for @xmath115 @xmath154      \\label{i : eq : p}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath155 may be written as ( eqs.([bet],[g0 ] ) ) @xmath156 in the case of efficient solutions , and @xmath157 for inefficient ones .",
    "equation ( [ i : eq : p ] ) is a nonlinear integro - differential equation for the function @xmath121 .",
    "mathematically , the advantage of this equation is that it is only an equation for one function of one variable .",
    "by contrast , the original equations ( [ c : d],[m : c ] ) form a quasi - linear system of the partial differential equation ( [ c : d ] ) in two variables @xmath158 under the algebraic condition ( [ m : c ] ) .",
    "moreover , provided that eq.([i : eq : p ] ) is solved , eqs.([m : c : f],[v : f ] ) and ( [ g0 ] ) allow us to calculate both the flow profile @xmath25 and the particle distribution @xmath159 .",
    "though eq.([i : eq : p ] ) is fairly complex , it can be easily solved numerically .",
    "it might be tempting to do so .",
    "however , such a shortcut would not allow much further insight into the physical nature of the solutions .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we shall pursue an analytic approach with the aid of a number of simplifying approximations .",
    "we first introduce a normalized spectral function @xmath160 where @xmath161 , and substitute the relativistic bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath162 using a new variable @xmath163 in place of @xmath29 , eq.([i : eq : p ] ) rewrites @xmath164 + \\frac{\\delta u}{\\delta u^ * }      \\label{j}\\ ] ] here we have introduced the notations @xmath165 @xmath166\\left[v(p_1)+\\delta       u\\right]^{-1 } \\equiv \\frac{p_0}{p_1 } \\theta \\ll 1            \\label{defs}\\ ] ] several comments should be made on eq.([j ] ) . through an argument similar to that followed by eq.([v : f ] ) we have simplified in eq.([j ] ) the contribution of the nonrelativistic particles ( @xmath167 ) and used the bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath168 for all @xmath29 instead of a more general form of it , @xmath169 .",
    "we thus choose the simplest realistic form of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "clearly such a choice suggests logically to replace @xmath170 in eq.([i : eq : p ] ) . the most serious potential problem that might be caused by such a simplified treatment is to overlook a relativistic peak at @xmath171",
    "the situation here is quite similar to that considered in ( @xcite ) , where the contribution of this peak to the cr pressure is shown to be negligible in comparison with that of the region @xmath172 for the efficient solutions considered further in this paper .",
    "these are mainly technical arguments for such a simplified treatment of eq.([v ] ) .",
    "the physical argument , as before , is an insignificant dynamical role of nonrelativistic particles .",
    "besides , we replaced @xmath173 by @xmath174 which is strictly valid only for @xmath175 .",
    "except for the region @xmath117 , this is precisely the property of efficient solutions , as we shall see .    our next simplification of eq.([j ] )",
    "is based on some assumption about its solution and this assumption will be justified later . since for efficient solutions @xmath176",
    ", @xmath177 is large in the dynamically most important part of the interval @xmath178 , i.e. for @xmath179 or , equivalently , @xmath180 .",
    "if we assume that the estimate @xmath181 holds , with some positive constants @xmath182 and @xmath183 , then @xmath184 in the exponent of eq.([j ] ) can be replaced by @xmath185 , since the integral will be dominated by the upper limit @xmath186 .",
    "thus eq.([j ] ) can be written as @xmath187 where we introduced the constant @xmath188 , to be determined from the following solvability condition @xmath189      \\label{a*}\\ ] ] it will be specified after the solution to eq.([j : i ] ) is found .",
    "now , it is convenient to rescale variables in eq.([j : i ] ) as follows @xmath190 where @xmath191 and then eq.([j : i ] ) rewrites as @xmath192 the goal of the next two subsections is to find an asymptotic ( @xmath193 ) solution of this equation .      the kernel of eq.([f ] ) belongs formally to the carleman type ( see , @xcite ) and the theory of linear equations of this type is very well developed .",
    "the problem is that eq.([f ] ) is nonlinear and it is also well known that the solutions in this case can be fundamentally different from those in the linear case . in particular , multiple solutions and bifurcations may occur",
    ". a simple iterative approach would be quite reasonable for seeking inefficient solutions of eq.([f ] ) , or better , of the more general equation ( [ i : eq : p ] ) . )",
    "can be reduced to a form resembling a well known equation in radiative transfer theory , the so called ambartsumyan equation which is also solved normally by iterations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analogy is , however , not complete and the solutions are different . ] in contrast to inefficient solutions , the efficient solutions being strongly nonlinear , can not be obtained perturbatively .",
    "rather we will find the solution to eq.([f ] ) which converges to the exact one as @xmath194 . indeed , once @xmath195 is set to zero , eq.([f ] ) contains no parameters at all and should be solved exactly . before we find this asymptotic ( @xmath196 ) solution to eq.([f ] ) , it is useful to establish some of its simple properties .    consider the following function in the complex @xmath197- plane .",
    "@xmath198 under obvious integrability conditions for the unknown function @xmath199 ( see @xcite ) , the function @xmath200 is a holomorphic function in the whole @xmath197- plane , cut along the line @xmath201 and has the degree -1 at infinity ( @xmath202 ) .",
    "this function is discontinuous across the cut and the jump is equal to @xmath203 . using the plemelji formulae from eq.([g ] )",
    "we thus have @xmath204 where , as indicated , the integral should be taken as a cauchy principal integral . from eq.([f ] ) we infer that the function @xmath205 possesses the same analytic properties as @xmath200 .",
    "thus , the solution @xmath199 to be found from eq.([f ] ) has two branch points at @xmath206 and @xmath207 and the jump @xmath208 across @xmath209 ) .      as we emphasized , the only small parameter available in eq.([f ] ) is @xmath193 .",
    "this is a very small parameter indeed ! for shock acceleration in situations of the astrophysical interest the magnitude of @xmath210 may be as large as @xmath211 ( for typical snr conditions ) .",
    "for a galactic wind termination shock this parameter may be even several orders of magnitude larger ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore tempting to set @xmath212 in eq.([f ] ) . in singularly perturbed problems , however , it is good practice to keep singular points at their ` exact ' positions in all orders of approximation .",
    "the singular character of the perturbation in the parameter @xmath213 is quite obvious since the case @xmath214 corresponds to the absence of a cut - off momentum ( @xmath215 ) , and the solutions are structurally different from those for @xmath216 .",
    "such physically critical quantities as @xmath217 and the precursor length may diverge as @xmath194 .",
    "we therefore keep @xmath213 small but fixed at some critical points in our further analysis .",
    "first , we represent eq.([f ] ) in the following equivalent form @xmath218 shifting then the lower singular point to the origin @xmath219 ) we rewrite the last equation as follows @xmath220 where @xmath221 after the ansatz @xmath222 for @xmath223 we have @xmath224 taking @xmath225 negative from the last equation we obtain @xmath226 separating real and imaginary parts we get @xmath227 it is seen that the function @xmath228 satisfies both last equations and , therefore , eq.([f_0 ] ) exactly .    returning to the variable @xmath197 we have @xmath229",

    "we obtain @xmath338 both expressions match at @xmath339 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath340 regulates the degree of shock modification for the efficient solution .",

    "clearly , the details of acceleration in the regime @xmath350 may be quite sensitive to the injection mechanism at the weak subshock .",
    "generally , eq.([crit ] ) places both upper and lower limits on the parameter @xmath4 . to see how it works consider the limit @xmath351 . in this case",
    "the total compression ratio is almost independent of @xmath8 , whereas @xmath302 is close to four : @xmath352 ( it is implied that at least @xmath353 , see eq.([crit ] ) , and therefore , @xmath354 ) . the subshock strength in this case is practically not affected despite a very strong modification of the flow in the precursor .",
    "if we now raise @xmath4 so that @xmath183 becomes larger and @xmath347 smaller , the condition ( [ crit ] ) may be violated because of the large r.h.s .",

    "it characterizes the injection efficiency for a significantly modified subshock and preserves the subshock through quenching injection eventually .",
    "one sees that in practice the minimum subshock strength @xmath361 is of the order of unity since the mach number is constrained by the condition @xmath362 , or equivalently , @xmath363 .",
    "the shock structure usually emerges from the balance between the nonlinear advection and the dissipation of the flow energy .",
    "the dissipation is normally provided by viscosity or heat conduction or by both .",
    "heat conduction alone may or may not ensure a smooth shock transition whereas viscosity alway does , and a viscous subshock should be inserted whenever other transport phenomena like heat conduction can not provide a smooth shock transition .",
    "the shock amplitude and its thickness in media with quadratic nonlinearity are related by @xmath364 , where @xmath365 is a relevant dissipation coefficient .",
    "we started our consideration from these well known facts of shock wave theory , because a very similar situation arises in shocks strongly modified by crs .",
    "for example the relation @xmath366 holds in this case .",
    "in contrast to the usual gasdynamics the flow energy is absorbed by the high energy particles , that have diffusivity @xmath367 . at least in the case of sufficiently high mach numbers considered throughout this paper , inviscid smooth transitions are not possible in cr modified shocks for any finite @xmath4 .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , while @xmath368 the nonlinear shock structure associated with the acceleration process disappears as well ( @xmath369 , eq.([r1 ] ) ) .",
    "second , this structure also disappears if injection becomes less and less efficient as the subshock vanishes .",
    "first , we consider the flow structure in a region where @xmath370 is not very small @xmath371 , i.e. basically beyond the diffusion length of injected particles . instead of eq.([fl :",
    "pot ] ) one may write @xmath372 where @xmath373 and @xmath374 . as in the previous subsection we focus on the efficient solution for which we obtain ( see sec.5.1 ) @xmath375 for @xmath376",
    "we then obtain the following implicit solution for the flow potential @xmath93 @xmath377 where @xmath378 for @xmath379 one obtains @xmath380 although this is correct only for @xmath381 . the velocity profile in this region",
    "has the following form @xmath382 this singular behavior may only take place in the interval @xmath383 that not necessarily exists . the prerequisite for this region to exist is a significant subshock reduction that is hardly possible as the preceding subsection suggests . for smaller",
    "@xmath148 one has to use eq.([fl : pot ] ) that yields @xmath384 this was a thin region close to the subshock , related to the diffusion length of low - energy injection particles , whose dynamical role is assumed to be unimportant and no major change in flow speed occurs at this scale .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning that , if it were not so , the flow structure in this region would be strongly influenced by the details of injection which are not considered in this paper .    for larger @xmath32 , when @xmath385 , the velocity profile is again close to linear @xmath386 which in the case of large @xmath387 and for @xmath388 can be simplified to @xmath389 where the total scale height of the precursor @xmath390 this velocity behavior is valid for @xmath391 .",
    "it is the most significant part of the shock transition .",
    "it comprises not only the largest velocity variation .",
    "it is also the most certain part regarding the asymptotic methods used here ( see also below ) . as mentioned earlier , besides this longest spatial scale there also exist two short scales associated with low energy injection particles ( cf .",
    "eq.([int : sing ] ) ) @xmath392 far from criticality , i.e. when @xmath393 or when the subshock is not modified very strongly , the interval @xmath394 collapses and these particles play no dynamical role in the shock structure .",
    "generally , this quasi - singular behavior does not seem to be persistent in the efficient solution .",
    "however , this conclusion might change in the case of the inefficient or the intermediate solution and may be useful in interpretation of observations and simulations .",
    "it should be recognizable as a region of very large @xmath395 just upstream from the subshock and generally should indicate that the acceleration process is close to criticality .",
    "however , we shall not consider this situation in more detail here .    beyond the precursor length , @xmath396 from eq.([u : erf1 ] ) we obtain @xmath397 again ,",
    "this region is less certain than that where @xmath391 , since for @xmath398 the underlying asymptotic solution of the diffusion - convection equation needs some minor modification ( see sec.3 ) . at the same time",
    "@xmath399 at this distance and the shock transition is virtually completed there .",
    "furthermore , this outermost part of the precursor is accessible only for particles that in reality may begin to leave the system and whose behavior is idealized to the greatest extent by the introduction of the sharp cut - off at @xmath400 .",
    "we see that there is no major physical reason for improving formula ( [ u : as ] ) in the present level of description .",
    "the particle spectrum is the main goal in any acceleration scheme .",
    "a formal expression for the particle spectral slope @xmath401 was given already in sec.3 ( see eq.([g0 ] ) ) in terms of the spectral function @xmath402 .",
    "its definition however involves @xmath403 itself and , what is even more important , the flow structure across the whole shock transition .",
    "then an independent equation for @xmath121 was derived and solved , but the solution still contained the undetermined nonlinear eigenvalue @xmath188 that we were able to specify only after the shock compression ratios had been obtained . moreover , the solution ( [ c : d : sol ] ) to the diffusion - convection equation is strictly valid only under specific assumptions concerning the spectrum itself .",
    "these assumptions can thus be justified only after the spectrum is calculated .",
    "the close link between all these quantities is a natural aspect of nonlinear shock acceleration .",
    "it is this complexity of the acceleration process that has been standing in the way of a full analytic calculation of the particle spectrum for a long time .    using the same normalization for @xmath73 as in eq.([fb ] )",

    ". however , as explained , the solution for the function @xmath408 is strictly valid only when @xmath409 , i.e. for sufficiently large @xmath29 .",
    "we seem to even have some difficulty in determining the magnitude of the spectrum in the momentum region where @xmath410 , since @xmath411 must be integrated in the exponent over the region where it is not determined accurately , i.e. in the region where @xmath412 .",
    "@xmath411 can be regularly calculated also in this case by continuing the @xmath413 expansion in sec.4 . at the same time this region is dynamically unimportant in the case of the efficient solution and",
    "there must be a way to get the high energy asymptotic result , i.e where @xmath414 in eq.([g0:1 ] ) , without resolving this intermediate momentum range .",
    "in fact we already exploited this approximation solving the integral equation ( [ j ] ) for @xmath415 .",
    "namely , all necessary information about the behavior of @xmath411 in the intermediate momentum range is ` hidden ' in the eigenvalue @xmath188 .",

    "one may also solve this equation exactly , transforming it to a linear equation for @xmath425 .",
    "indeed , introducing @xmath426 we obtain @xmath427 after simple calculations the solution that is regular at the origin can be written down in the following form @xmath428 this allows us to determine the constant @xmath305 . since @xmath429 from eq.([defs ] ) , we have @xmath430 which can be calculated to yield @xmath431 for practical purposes , instead of eq.([y : sol ] ) , it is more convenient to use an approximate formula that follows immediately from eq.([j:1 ] ) @xmath432 where @xmath433 for @xmath422 and @xmath434 , for @xmath435 .",

    "the most interesting aspect of this solution is that the postshock spectrum @xmath73 is a power - law in a broad momentum range with a universal index coinciding with the test particle result for the shock of compression ratio  7 . for @xmath439",
    "approaching @xmath4 , the spectrum @xmath142 flattens .",
    "nevertheless , its slope remains universal , decreasing from 1/2 for @xmath440 to about 0.3 at @xmath441 , independently of any parameters .",
    "in this paper we have found that kinetic solution for diffusive shock acceleration which emphasizes a very strong coupling of accelerated particles with the gas flow .",
    "we have also demonstrated that there are three different solutions in a specified region of parameter space .",
    "this region is undoubtedly of great astrophysical interest .",
    "therefore , the question , how efficient shock acceleration is , implies automatically the question which solution among these three is the attractor of a system evolving in time .",
    "this question can be also put in the following context .",
    "is shock acceleration a passive process in which only a limited fraction of the shock energy is transformed into more or less parasitically accelerated particles , or is the shock itself radically restructured by these particles and they consume almost all its energy ?",
    "are transitions between these different states possible and if so , how do they occur ?",
    "thus , the notion of critical phenomena appears to be quite plausible for nonlinear shock acceleration .",
    "the first step of any quantitative theory of such phenomena should be the identification of a system parameter and the determination of its critical values .",
    "this parameter ( or parameters ) should encompass all the physically relevant quantities . as it was shown in the present paper ,",
    "the most important system parameter is @xmath442 .",
    "for instance , if we consider the case in which @xmath8 is fixed and sufficiently large , so that @xmath443 , acceleration is essentially governed by the parameter @xmath444 ( see sec.5 ) . in particular , the total compression @xmath445 in this case .",
    "other regions in @xmath446 parameter space are discussed in sec.5 , and one important statement is very simple : there always exists a critical @xmath447 such that for @xmath448 only the inefficient solution is possible .",
    "moreover , there is an upper critical value for @xmath4 , or more precisely for @xmath449 ( see eq.([crit2 ] ) ) , beyond which the efficient solution fails to exist again .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "once this parameter exceeds the critical value , the backreaction of the crs on the foreshock flow becomes so strong and , as a result , the spectrum at lower energies so steep , that the required cr pressure can not be maintained .",
    "also at @xmath450 , the system was found to be in quite different states , ranging from @xmath451 independent of @xmath8 ( when @xmath452 ) , to @xmath453 with a noticeable subshock reduction @xmath454 , in the opposite extreme @xmath455 .",
    "this regime ( @xmath453 ) could basically be quite natural also for the  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) since it corresponds effectively to the case @xmath456 ( in the  it is implied that @xmath457 ) , and once the subshock is modified , one could very easily estimate also the total shock modification as ( eq.([c : r ] ) ) @xmath453 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that such an estimate results from only two assumptions .",
    "the first says that the subshock is noticeably modified , and the second that it is not smeared out completely .",
    "no further calculations are needed .",
    "it means unambiguously that under these circumstances the compression ratio of a steady large mach number shock must be rather large . in the",
    ", however , @xmath302 always crosses unity in the case of efficient solution already at @xmath458 even if @xmath459 .",
    ", @xmath460 the parameter @xmath461 remains infinite .",
    "we recall in this regard that the problem under question is a singularly perturbed one in the parameter @xmath462 .",
    "] one is forced to take that branch of two - fluid solution of r - h relations in which @xmath463 beyond this critical @xmath8 and the scaling @xmath464 can not be recovered since it would correspond to a rarefaction wave @xmath465 . in contrast , the inequality @xmath466 is always guaranteed in the kinetic description for any finite @xmath467 .",
    "this is a fundamental difference between kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions .",
    "the latter is not capable of preserving the kinetic link between injection and high - energy particles .",
    "it allows @xmath468 which means on the kinetic level of description an infinitely steep suprathermal particle distribution for @xmath469 .",
    "this must normally result in @xmath470 .",
    "however , this does not occur within the two - fluid description in which crs and thermal plasma are coupled only hydrodynamically , not kinetically . in the kinetic picture",
    "presented above , this link is established mathematically through the nonlinear integral equation that simply has no eigenvalues corresponding to efficient solutions when the subshock is too weak and the spectrum in the suprathermal region too steep with the implication that the cr - pressure does not suffice .",
    "the kinetic link of suprathermal and high energy particles is a constitutive aspect of selfregulation in nonlinear shock acceleration .",
    "indeed , it leads to the following universal ( mach number independent ) relation between the flow deceleration in the smooth and in the discontinuous parts of the shock transition ( eq.([r1 ] ) ) @xmath471 therefore , the modification effect disappears whenever does the subshock .",
    "in fact this happens even earlier , since the criterion ( [ crit ] ) will be violated and this solution disappears abruptly when @xmath472 drops below some critical value ( eq.([rs : min2 ] ) ) .",
    "one remarkable result that came about concerns the downstream spectrum @xmath92 . over a wide portion of momentum space the power - law index depends on absolutely nothing !",
    "it equals @xmath473 for the standard normalization of particle distribution .",
    "interestingly , this coincides precisely with a test particle spectrum in an unmodified shock of compression ratio  7 .",
    "thus , if the power - law index would be calculated using the ratio of specific heats @xmath474 ( which is clearly very close to 4/3 ) rather than the compression ratio , one would obtain essentially the same result .",
    "our solutions imply that @xmath9 can be large , at least larger than 7 .",
    "nevertheless the spectrum fails to flatten with growing compression .",
    "the resolution of this ` paradox ' lies obviously in the thickness of the shock , that grows simultaneously with @xmath9 and @xmath4 , and these two oppositely acting factors compensate each other exactly .",
    "similarly there is no flattening of the spectrum with momentum unless @xmath475 , since particles that sample larger compression at larger momenta see a more extended flow structure as well .",
    "one could say that while in the test particle theory the energy spectrum is scale invariant because all the internal shock scales are irrelevant , in the nonlinear theory both the momentum spectrum and the shock structure are scale invariant in a certain region of phase space .",
    "the spectrum flattening at the cut - off ( @xmath476 decreases from 3.5 to about 3.3 ) is obviously caused by the presence of this sharp cut - off itself .",
    "the mathematical nature of this flattening is very simple and can be explained using the analytic properties of the spectral function @xmath408 and hence , those of @xmath92 in the complex @xmath29-plane .",
    "namely , in an unphysical region at @xmath477 , @xmath142 has the branch point , which is formally responsible for the flattening at @xmath441 . in a physically more realistic case in which the losses are distributed at @xmath478",
    ", this flattening may not appear .",
    "( we therefore do not speculate for example about a possible link of this spectrum flattening with the bump around the energy @xmath479 on the galactic cr spectrum . ) in the present picture , however , particles with @xmath480 seem to ` know ' how high is the cut - off , which appears to be strange from the point of view of causality .",
    "this ` information ' is provided again , by the flow structure , in fact through the singularity of the spectral function @xmath121 at @xmath477 .",
    "as particles come nearer to @xmath4 they also diffuse to the outer region of the precursor where @xmath25 approaches @xmath481 exponentially .",
    "hence these particles develop a spectrum that is closer to @xmath482 .",
    "recall that in the case under consideration @xmath483 .",
    "moreover , if we formally extend @xmath73 beyond @xmath441 , considering @xmath484 as a test particle spectrum , we get the power - law index @xmath485 as @xmath486 instead of the ` exact ' @xmath487 . this small deviation can be easily removed and the modification needed for that will not affect the region where @xmath12 .",
    "this difference in the spectrum slope occurred because , for simplicity , we treated the dynamically unimportant region @xmath488 on the same basis as the region @xmath489 ( see the end of sec.5 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to examine what may happen in a time dependent case .",
    "formally , the generalization of our results to time dependent acceleration should not be a serious problem .",
    "namely , for sufficiently large @xmath4 one can adopt an ` adiabatic ' approximation in which the solution has approximately the same form as that found in this paper , except for parameters this solution depends on ; they will slowly evolve with time . if the mach number can be fixed , the only parameter we need is @xmath490 , all the others and the flow configuration are calculable .",
    "the cut - off increment may , at least tentatively , be obtained from the usual equation @xmath491 .",
    "since the acceleration time equals @xmath492 , the process should be slow compared with the time scale at lower momenta .",
    "this should justify an adiabatic approach .",
    "however , the spectrum at the cut - off may differ from our steady state solution significantly .",
    "our main conclusion concerning the overall spectrum to have a universal index @xmath493 may also be a subject for corrections due to a number of physical reasons ignored in our consideration .",
    "these should be taken into account before we attempt to compare our results with any observations or numerical calculations .",
    "we have studied the simplest case of a plane steady shock with specified bohm diffusion in which the magnetic field either plays no dynamical role or is quasiparallel to the shock normal .",
    "clearly a more realistic geometry , time dependence and losses increasing continuously with the particle energy , will steepen the spectrum .",
    "we also have simplified our description of subrelativistic particles replacing @xmath494 by unity in the pressure integral ( eq.[fb ] ) , ( see eq.([j ] ) and the text below it ) .",
    "doing so we could overlook some feature in the particle spectrum at @xmath171 and ignore the role of a possible relativistic peak at @xmath495 in the partial pressure .",
    "generally , this peak may or may not develop in a modified shock",
    ". in the cases considered throughout this paper its contribution to the particle pressure would be much smaller than that of the high energy particles @xmath496 ( see appendix a in @xcite ) .",
    "the most probable correction to the particle spectrum due to the relativistic peak should be a turn in the spectral slope at @xmath497 just because of the correspondent factors in the kernel of the integral equation ( [ i : eq : p ] ) . and finally , particle diffusion is normally assumed to be provided by waves that , in turn , are excited by accelerated particles . this link may not only soften the spectrum but also change other characteristics of acceleration process noticeably . notwithstanding the physical importance of the above factors , we believe that the key issue for understanding the nonlinear shock acceleration is the gas flow  cr coupling .",
    "this coupling may , at least formally , operate under prescribed injection , diffusivity and upper cut - off momentum .",
    "it should be understood as such before a comprehensive nonlinear theory of shock acceleration is done .",
    "the major reason for that is of course the multiplicity of the solution .",
    "we have presented only the steady state solutions and specified the conditions under which they appear multiply .",
    "the main issue now is of course their realisability .",
    "whereas for the case of a unique solution a proof of its stability suffices , in a parameter range where all the three solutions are admitted , the full time dependent calculations may be needed to predict the system behavior .    already at this stage several important features of the acceleration process can be pointed out .",
    "first , there are no such ` minor ' things like the injection rate or the cut - off momentum that can be considered as having a small effect on the acceleration process and their treatment should not be oversimplified just by arguing that the former is small and the latter is large .",
    "these parameters enter all the main results and in many cases symmetrically , through @xmath498 . therefore ,",
    "both @xmath499 and @xmath4 are equally important .",
    "this conclusion is strictly valid for a steady state .",
    "one can imagine a time evolution in which @xmath500 increases but @xmath2 decreases leaving a parameter such as @xmath501 that governs the steady state flow structure ( or its equivalent in a time dependent formulation , which would have the meaning of the energy content of accelerated particles ) approximately constant .",
    "furthermore , in time dependent situations the constraint ( [ rh : m ] ) is strictly speaking not valid , and a complete smoothing of the subshock can not be excluded .",
    "this last remark might be important for the interpretation of numerical results .    a number of time dependent numerical solutions were obtained in the past ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "except perhaps the case considered by bell , ( @xmath502 it is not clear whether they are within the parameter range where multiple solutions appear or should rather be regarded as inefficient solutions , sometimes with quite a strong shock modification and high acceleration efficiency .",
    "furthermore , at moderate mach numbers and near the bifurcation point the ` inefficient ' solution may be not very different from two solutions that we termed efficient and intermediate .",
    "we will discuss the relations between these three solutions in more detail in paper ii .",
    "the injection rate calculated in ( mv95 , m96 , mv97 ) , essentially depends on details of the subshock dissipation mechanism like the level and the spectrum of underlying plasma turbulence .",
    "the obliqueness of the magnetic field and the presence of reflected particles ( @xcite ) will clearly influence the injection rate too .",
    "these parameters may vary from model to model and it is therefore perfectly reasonable to consider the injection rate @xmath2 as another free parameter along with @xmath8 and @xmath4 , at least in the context of nonlinear shock acceleration studied here .",
    "the subshock compression ratio @xmath503 obtained in this paper may then be combined with the injection rate @xmath504 obtained in the papers listed above to yield both @xmath505 and @xmath506 .",
    "however , a microscopic subshock dissipation mechanism that operates quasi - independently of the large scale shock modification , should be identified for this purpose in each particular physical model ( see m96 for an example of such a mechanism ) .    besides the injection rate @xmath2 we introduced the injection momentum @xmath58 ( eq.([p_c ] ) ) in order to separate the cr and the thermal populations .",
    "this can be done unambiguously if the injection is weak so that the injected particles which are between these two populations in the momentum space , do not modify significantly the flow upstream by themselves but only after being accelerated to very high energies and therefore over a much larger scale .",
    "this is the essence of our approach to distinguish between thermal and high - energy populations based on the difference in diffusion length of the respective components . clearly",
    "the monotonic growth of the diffusion coefficient with the particle momentum is very critical here .",
    "if the subshock is sufficiently strong , these two populations of particles do not even overlap in the upstream phase space , fig.2 .",
    "they are separated by the region @xmath507 , where @xmath508 ( m96 ) , @xmath509 is measured in the local upstream frame where @xmath510 and @xmath511 is the thermal velocity at the same point .",
    "therefore , the momentum @xmath58 is a rather formal lower boundary separating the cr gas from thermal plasma and from the viewpoint of the upstream distribution , @xmath58 ( or may be @xmath512 , where @xmath305 is the pitch - angle ) can be chosen arbitrarily within this empty part of the phase space . turning to the downstream region",
    "we note that the injection solution yields the particle spectrum that starts from the thermal maxwellian and evolves at higher momenta into the power - law determined by the subshock compression .",
    "this allows the smooth matching of this injection solution with the low - momenta asymptotic solution of eq.([c : d ] ) within an extended overlapping interval in the region @xmath513 , ( see also m96 , mv97 ) .",
    "this means that again , one should be able to choose @xmath58 arbitrarily within the overlapping interval and all physically meaningful results must be independent of @xmath58 . formally enters the definition of the cr number density @xmath514 ( sec.4 ) and thus the parameter @xmath515 .",
    "but this is an implicit dependence on @xmath58 through @xmath516 and once @xmath517 is defined @xmath58-invariant , ( by subtraction of the thermal maxwellian from the total particle distribution ) , this dependence disappears .",
    "second , the `` injection momentum '' @xmath58 can appear in some criticality conditions ( sec.5 ) and also in situations when the approximation described just below is only marginally correct .",
    "this means that the description of the injection process by only one parameter @xmath2 is insufficient in such a situations . on the other hand in selfconsistent injection models both",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath58 should be explicitly specified in terms of physical quantities like the thermal velocity and the mach number .",
    "if so , a complete solution of the acceleration problem depends not on parameters like @xmath2 or @xmath58 but only on these physical quantities . at the same time , as it may be seen from fig.2 , the transition region between the thermal maxwellian and the high - energy power - law is relatively narrow , so that the quantity @xmath58 has also a clear physical meaning . ]",
    "if @xmath58 indeed lies in this empty phase space region upstream , then @xmath518 in eqs.([m : c : p],[fb ] ) .",
    "however , such a choice of @xmath58 may cause technical difficulties since the diffusion - convection equation is not valid in this region due to anisotropy of pitch - angle distribution .",
    "if we take @xmath58 larger , just to make the diffusion - convection equation valid , then @xmath519 and must generally speaking be retained in bernoulli s integral , eqs.([m : c : p],[fb ] ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that the matching of the downstream injection solution onto the standard power - law occurs typically at @xmath29 somewhat larger than the void in the upstream distribution .",
    "thus , @xmath58 may be slightly higher than the lower boundary of the upstream cr distribution .",
    "the above details of the phase space geometry , being essential for injection and for its link with the further acceleration , are not so critical for the subject of this paper , i.e. for the shock modification by high - energy particles",
    ". it should be emphasized , however , that an important physical condition for legitimating both the injection theory and the present study is that the suprathermal particles with momenta @xmath520 , play no considerable dynamical role in the precursor , i.e. their contribution to @xmath54 is much smaller than that of the rest of momentum space @xmath521 . as we have stressed already",
    ", they do not produce a noticeable flow variation over their own diffusion length @xmath522 which for example justifies the adoption of the injection calculations performed in a quasi - homogeneous upstream flow .",
    "the injection theory produces a suprathermal downstream asymptotics @xmath523 where @xmath524 and @xmath525 depends also on @xmath526 along with a number of other plasma parameters near the subshock like the downstream temperature and the magnitude of mhd - turbulence ( see mv95 , m96 ) .",
    "this is essentially the same as eq.([low : m ] ) .",
    "the theory of injection also determines the spatial distribution of @xmath527 at the subshock for particles with momenta @xmath528 , where @xmath529 .",
    "therefore @xmath530 is virtually irrelevant for our further consideration and only the parameter @xmath525 is needed .",
    "we examine the idea that the result ( [ ren : g ] ) that is strictly valid for small values of @xmath81 , is also a good approximation to the solution of the convection diffusion equation in general . to this purpose , it is natural to seek the solution of eq.([c : d ] ) in the following form @xmath531 clearly we have @xmath532 as a boundary condition .",
    "our objective here is to demonstrate that @xmath533 also for @xmath534 noticeably larger than unity .",
    "a practically important region is of course that where @xmath81 is not very large due to the exponential factor in eq.([ren : g : p ] ) . introducing also @xmath535 for the function @xmath536 we have the following equation that can be easily derived from eq.([c : d ] ) @xmath537 where @xmath538 . at this point",
    "we need some more information about the function @xmath539 . as we have shown in sec.5.2 .",
    ", for not very small @xmath97 , more precisely for @xmath540 and in the case of strong shock modification , the velocity of the flow behaves as follows ( see eq.([u : erf ] ) ) @xmath541 where @xmath542 is the probability integral .",
    "thus , for @xmath543 , to a good approximation we may write @xmath544 for larger @xmath488 the function @xmath545 falls off exponentially . but this region is dynamically unimportant ( @xmath98 is exponentially small already for @xmath480 ) and we confine our consideration to the case in which eq.([q ] ) holds . introducing a new variable @xmath546 and performing the variable transformation @xmath547 eq.([g : hat ] ) rewrites @xmath548 where @xmath549 physically , the problem ( [ g : hat:1 ] ) should be posed as follows . at @xmath550 has to be matched smoothly onto the solution of the injection problem as it was discussed earlier .",
    "then @xmath536 and hence @xmath98 can be determined from eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) provided that @xmath551 is known .",
    "this latter , in turn , depends on the spectral index of the downstream distribution to be found from eq.([b : c ] ) . as it is shown in appendix c , unless @xmath552 or @xmath435 the function @xmath551 and",
    "thus @xmath553 is a slow function of @xmath197 .",
    "we observe that a characteristic ` time scale ' in eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) is @xmath554 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath555 and @xmath556 as approximately constant one can easily solve the problem ( [ g : hat:1 ] ) in terms of parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "but even this simple solution is not really needed for our purposes .",
    "it turns out ( appendix c ) that @xmath95 for @xmath557 .",
    "consider the region @xmath558 , where the solution ` forgets ' the ` initial ' condition @xmath559 , that is given by the high energy end of the injection solution .",
    "the solution to eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) will be determined by the boundary condition @xmath560 and one may see that for not too large @xmath561 we also have @xmath562 .",
    "furthermore , the injection solution yields the spatial distribution of the particle spectrum that is consistent with the exponential decay @xmath563 ( see mv95 ) .",
    "we may thus put @xmath564 which yields @xmath565 for small @xmath556 . as we mentioned above this solution",
    "is not valid for @xmath566 , but once @xmath556 is small we can ignore this region since @xmath567 there .    finally , we note that this simple solution ( @xmath568 ) of eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) is exact if we require @xmath569 in eq.([delta ] ) .",
    "this yields for the spectral index @xmath570 where @xmath571 is the spectral index at @xmath572 ) , which is given by the injection theory and coincides with the standard power - law index calculated for the subshock compression ratio . for larger @xmath197 , @xmath87 drops to 1/6 rapidly .",
    "clearly , for @xmath573 to hold , the above behavior of @xmath551 must be consistent with the solution of eq.([b : c ] ) , which will be confirmed in appendix  c.",
    "it has been understood for a long time that in contrast to the test particle theory , the shock acceleration in the nonlinear regime can not be decomposed as a sequence of independent processes like the formation of the overall flow structure , particle spectrum , and injection , or losses .",
    "even the magnitude of the cut - off momentum can not be specified prior to obtaining the full solution when it is influenced by the solution itself ( we did not consider this case here ) .",
    "all these factors are linked very tightly in the solution obtained in the preceding sections and non of them can be prescribed a priori .",
    "nevertheless , we made several assumptions concerning mostly the flow profile and the particle spectrum .",
    "for the sake of convenience we list here these assumptions along with the confirming results .",
    "first , we neglect the adiabatic gas compression term in the bernoulli s equation upstream , eq.([m : c : p ] ) . denoting @xmath574 we rewrite eq.([m : c : p ] ) as @xmath575",
    "we must specify the condition under which we may invert @xmath576 to obtain @xmath577 .",
    "first of all we observe that the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([ber : v ] ) has a very sharp minimum at @xmath578 . since @xmath579 the approximation",
    "@xmath577 may be good over most of the precursor , where @xmath580 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "indeed , using eq.([u : x : sm ] ) we can rewrite this inequality as @xmath581 >   m^{-\\frac{2}{\\gamma + 1 } }      \\label{constr1}\\ ] ] in the trivial case @xmath582 , i.e. @xmath583 the approximation @xmath584 is correct for all @xmath585 .",
    "if only the weaker condition @xmath301 is fulfilled , we obtain the following constraint ( eqs.([r1],[constr1 ] ) ) @xmath586 substituting @xmath587 and @xmath588 from sec.5.1 , we obtain @xmath589 that means that we may neglect the adiabatic compression term already inside the scale height of injected particles @xmath590 .",
    "smaller @xmath32 belong virtually to the internal subshock structure which can not be resolved within the diffusion - convection description in any case .",
    "if the nonrelativistic correction to the diffusion coefficient is important , one should write @xmath591 , where @xmath592 is the ` true ' diffusion coefficient at @xmath593 . then the inequality ( [ constr3 ] ) becomes more stringent and @xmath32 must be outside the diffusion length of low energy injection particles .",
    "our next assumption concerned the functions @xmath594 and @xmath595 that enter eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) .",
    "according to sec.6 and for sufficiently large @xmath180 we may write @xmath596 , to yield @xmath597 one sees that @xmath87 is close to @xmath598 for @xmath29 not too close to the upper cut - off .",
    "what is even more important for our treatment of eq.([g : hat:1 ] ) in appendix b is that @xmath599 . even in the worst case",
    "possible , namely when @xmath600 , we still have @xmath601 , so that the result ( [ c : d : sol ] ) , based largely on the above behavior of parameters @xmath602 and @xmath603 , is still a good approximation to the solution of the diffusion - convection equation .",
    "a number of our approximations depend on the value @xmath604 , sec.3.1 .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to determine this quantity directly from our asymptotic solution for @xmath605 since it is formally valid for @xmath606 .",
    "we therefore should estimate @xmath607 directly from the definition ( [ v ] ) .",
    "@xmath608 the quantity @xmath609 accounts of the nonrelativistic correction to the diffusion coefficient used .",
    "according to eq.([constr1 ] ) we thus have @xmath610 since the criticality parameter @xmath353 can not be very large and @xmath611 not very small ( see the end of sec.5.1 ) , we infer that @xmath612 is a reasonable approximation for sufficiently small @xmath613 ."
