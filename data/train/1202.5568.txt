    "in the problem of targeted signaling or targeted navigability in a network , a message or vehicle begins a journey at a given source vertex with the intention of reaching another target vertex in the most efficient way possible . it is implicitly assumed that the message or vehicle is restricted to jumping from vertex to vertex along the edges available in the network .",
    "the applications of this area , such as distant communication in complex systems @xcite , and problems related to the traffic in cities @xcite , make the area an active field of research . the efficiency in solving the problem is measured in terms of a cost , which is associated with each possible path the message or vehicle can follow in its journey from the source to the target .",
    "two main issues have to be accounted for in defining the cost of targeting : the length of the paths and the difficulty of identifying a set of convenient paths which connect the source with the target .",
    "once the cost is defined , the efficiency in the task of targeted signaling or navigability can be improved by choosing a convenient searching strategy that minimize the cost .",
    "the most basic strategy for searching the target is the non - biased or fully random walker .",
    "the message or vehicle moves randomly without bias through the network with the hope that eventually it will reach the target . in this case",
    ", there is no cost associated in choosing the appropriate path to the target , so the focus is in the determination of how long it will take to the message or vehicle to reach its target .",
    "it means that the efficiency is determined by comunicability between the source and the target .",
    "this problem was studied in detail by estrada et al .",
    "@xcite , who introduced a penalty based in the lenghts of the paths .",
    "even more , this is a problem related to the first passage time and has been investigated in several paradigmatic network models @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress here that the random walk strategy has to be differentiated from network sampling using random walkers@xcite and from non - specific broadcasting where a signal is propagated and amplified as in the spreading of diseases , spam or computer viruses @xcite .",
    "other approaches deviate from a fully random walker but still dismiss the quantification of the cost of choosing the appropriated paths from the source to the target .",
    "now the problem is finding a reasonable strategy for searching the target , and the selection of a particular strategy is driven by minimizing of the length of the journey from the source to the target . among the different strategies are self  avoiding random walks@xcite , intermittent random walks on lattices@xcite , the consideration of local topological features@xcite , and greedy strategies , which are used in the case of networks with spatial embedding@xcite .",
    "a common feature of all the above mentioned methods is that they use knowledge about the topological structure for the design of the strategies . a different approach to the problem consists in evaluating the difficulty of choosing the appropriated paths .",
    "the difficulty can be quantified in terms of the amount of information or knowledge required to follow these paths . in some cases the information is measured ad hoc , for example , using a fixed information cost per vertex traversed @xcite . in general , the information required for choosing the right direction in the network depends on the local topological details ; for instance , the information required to take the right direction grows with the number of available options .",
    "entropy measures provide a natural way of quantifying information ; in fact , this measurements have been applied successfully in complex networks before @xcite .",
    "in particular , these methods were applied recently to quantify information in the problem of targeted signaling or navigability @xcite and in the complementary problem of efficient diffusion in a network @xcite .",
    "this is the approach we adopted in our work to quantify the difficulty of choosing the appropriate paths that connect the source with the target .",
    "we focus on strategies that may be adapted to any topology and in which the message or vehicle is represented by a biased random walker .",
    "these strategies will allow the interpolation between a fully random walker , which uses no information to reach its destiny , and a directed walker that travels along the shortest paths using all the available information to orient itself . in this regard , there are several antecedents with strategies that interpolate to some extend the random and the biased regime @xcite .",
    "in this work we follow the line of previous works @xcite in the sense that an information measure is used to regulate how directed the walks are .",
    "we extend the ideas of refs . [ ] where the information is measured considering only the shortest paths by allowing the usage of less information at expenses of longer walks @xcite .",
    "we introduce a formalism for measuring the amount of information used by a biased random walker to reach its target . using this formalism",
    "we develop a method which depends on one parameter that regulates how biased is the random walk . in our method",
    "the overall information is increased each time the walker performs a step , so longer walks result in larger penalization . optimizing the walker s information forces the walker to travel along increasingly shorter paths or , equivalently , the paths are biased to the target .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section [ theo_back ]",
    "we introduce the theoretical background , defining the measures of information used by the random walker in going from the source to the target .",
    "we also introduce the penalization rules used to interpolate between the random and the directed regimes ; in particular , the optimal penalization is defined . in section",
    "[ analytical ] we analyze simple examples that can be solved analytically , which are useful to understand how the method works in different topological environments , including some limiting cases . in section [ simulations ]",
    "we applied the method by using numerical simulations in more complex networks , such as a random network and a barabsi  albert scale  free network model .",
    "finally , in section [ conclu ] final remarks , conclusions and possible extensions to our work are discussed .",
    "consider a non - directed network with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 links where a random walker jumps at a given time step from a vertex @xmath2 to a neighbor vertex @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 .",
    "for each vertex @xmath2 in the network the transition probabilities @xmath4 satisfy the normalization condition , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of all nearest - neighbors vertices of vertex @xmath2 , and @xmath7 for all @xmath2 .",
    "this means the walker is forced to move at each time step .",
    "the amount of information given to the walker for taking an exit from a given vertex @xmath2 to one of its nearest neighbors is the information cost defined by @xcite @xmath8,\\ ] ] which is the difference between the maximum entropy in the space of events of taking one of the exits minus the entropy the exits of vertex @xmath2 already have associated . here",
    "@xmath9 denotes the degree of vertex @xmath2 .",
    "let us consider now that the walker starts its journey at a source vertex named @xmath10 and ends the trip at a vertex we call the target @xmath11 ; furthermore , during the journey the walker passes by the vertex @xmath2 .",
    "we want to obtain an expression for the information needed in going from @xmath10 to @xmath11 given a distribution of probabilities @xmath4 . from the information cost defined above one",
    "can derive a recursive expression for the amount of information @xmath12 used by the walker in going from vertex @xmath2 to @xmath11 . accordingly",
    "this information cost is expressed as @xmath13 hence , with the constrain that @xmath14 ( i.e. , no information is needed by the walker once the target is reached ) , a set of linear equations with unknowns @xmath15 can be defined and solved provided the probabilities @xmath16 are known .",
    "a similar approach was used by rosvall et al .",
    "[ ] to quantify the amount of information needed by a walker which is restricted to walking only the shortest paths . in the case that the random walker can step back during the walk , the amount of information is@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the set of all shortest paths @xmath19 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath20 denotes the set of interior vertices of the shortest path @xmath19 .    the minimum for the information @xmath21 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , regarding the transition probabilities @xmath4 , corresponds to a fully random walker with probabilities defined by @xmath22 in this case @xmath23 for all @xmath2 .",
    "as expected , in finite networks the fully random walker needs no information to reach the target , but this has the drawback of leading to very long walks on average .",
    "since we are interested in targeted signaling , the results obtained above are of little utility . in order to fix this problem",
    ", we introduce a penalization rule that weights the paths favoring the shortest paths to the target .",
    "this penalization will modify the transition probabilities that minimize the information required to reach the target ; the longer walks will be rejected and then a random walker that searches the network using this probabilities will be biased to the target .    the simplest way to introduce a penalty is by paying a cost each time the walker passes through a vertex .",
    "this information cost is not used by the walker when it is travelling the network  unlike the information associated to the @xmath4but it allows the evaluation of intrinsic properties of the paths to the target , taking into account the whole network . for instance , depending on the degree of penalty needed for reaching an optimal set of paths , one can estimate the difficulty of finding the paths in a given network . once the penalization term is introduced in equation ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", it becomes @xmath24 where the term , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 is the penalization term .",
    "now since @xmath27 , @xmath28 is not a minimum anymore and hence a fully random walk does not minimize the information . as shown in the next section ,",
    "minimizing @xmath29 with respect to @xmath16 keeping @xmath30 fixed leads to a biased walk , which becomes more directed to its target as @xmath30 increases . in fact , the fully random walker corresponds to @xmath31 , and in the other extreme when @xmath32 the walker is forced to walk along the shortest paths .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 stands for the amount of information the walker uses in going from @xmath10 to @xmath11 plus the _ intrinsic _ information related to the penalization .    to clarify the role of @xmath30",
    "let us introduce a quantity that will allow us to define an optimal value for the penalization .",
    "first of all , we name by @xmath34 the probabilities @xmath16 that minimizes @xmath33 at a given fixed value of @xmath30 , and @xmath35 is the function evaluated at these values , that is , the minimum .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 is the value of @xmath21 evaluated on @xmath34 .",
    "we compute the amount of information introduced by @xmath30 as @xmath37 which is related to intrinsic properties of the network , as we mentioned above .",
    "then the relative amount of intrinsic information in going from @xmath10 to @xmath11 is @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 lies in @xmath40 $ ] reaching its maximum value @xmath41 when @xmath42 or @xmath32 .",
    "it has a minimum value @xmath43 at @xmath44 , which we define as the optimal value of @xmath30 . at @xmath45",
    "the walker minimizes the relative amount of intrinsic information with respect to the whole information .",
    "it means that up to minimum point , the information the walker gains above the paths to the target is preponderating .",
    "an increase of @xmath30 further @xmath45 certainly implies a gain of useful information , but at lower pace than the intrinsic information .",
    "then , the value @xmath45 gives insights about the searchability of a network in relation to its topology .",
    "to further clarify the formal ideas introduced in the above section , let us analyze some simple examples which can be solved analytically .",
    "we named each example analyzed in order to facilitate the discussion ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , these examples will provide some insights on the problem of targeted delivery of information or navigation .",
    "in particular , the last two examples correspond to extreme cases in which remarkably different topological patterns prevail . on one extreme",
    "is the case where only one right path to the target exists ( all the other alternative paths dead end ) , and on the other extreme is the case where there are a lot of similar paths to the target  not all of them optimal  with a few shortest paths .",
    "the penalization scheme behaves differently in each case , serving as an indicator of which kind of topological pattern could prevail on real networks or network models .",
    "this example is outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig1](*a * ) . for the sake of clarity let us simplify the notation redefining @xmath46 by @xmath47 , @xmath12 by @xmath48 , @xmath49 by @xmath50 . in this case",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq6 ] ) takes the form : @xmath51 by solving the equation for @xmath52 and minimizing with respect to @xmath53 fixing @xmath30 , one obtains the following expression for the critical @xmath53 @xmath54 it is easy to verify that @xmath55 when @xmath42 and that @xmath56 when @xmath57 ; therefore one obtains the expected limiting cases .",
    "the unpenalized case , @xmath42 , corresponds to a fully random walker , and the other case @xmath32 , corresponds to a walker fully biased towards the shortest path .",
    "one can see that @xmath58 increases when @xmath30 goes from @xmath41 to @xmath59 , indicating that the bias in the walk grows with the penalization @xmath30 ; in other words , a larger penalization leads to a shorter walk . the relative amount of intrinsic information corresponding to this example ,",
    "@xmath60 is plotted as a function of @xmath30 in fig .",
    "one can see a minimum which corresponds to an optimal penalization @xmath45 .",
    "notice that @xmath61 is large even at @xmath45 ; more than half of the total information @xmath62 is due to the information introduced by @xmath30 .",
    "the inset shows the information used by the walker to reach the target @xmath63 as function of @xmath30 .",
    "it increases as @xmath30 increases and converges asymptotically to the case of the shortest path @xmath64 as @xmath32 .",
    "the starlike network [ see fig . [ fig1](b ) ] represents the extremal case of only one direct path to the target and a large number of dead ends . at variance with the previous examples , which contain a fixed number of vertices",
    ", this example has no restrictions in the number of vertices , allowing the study of quantities that scales with the network s size .",
    "like the previous example , this new one can be analytically solved by using the particular symmetries of this network , whatever the size of the network . equations ( [ eq6 ] ) in this case reduce to : @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "the critical probability of @xmath52 is @xmath67    which satisfies the expected limiting cases : @xmath68 , @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath32 . in this example",
    ", it is interesting to compute the amount of information related to shortest paths @xmath72 and the optimal information @xmath63 at @xmath45 as function of the number of vertices @xmath73 .",
    "the following expression is obtained from the first , @xmath74 , while the second ( @xmath63 ) is obtained numerically .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows these quantities as function of @xmath75 in a linear log plot .",
    "one can see that also @xmath63 scales logarithmically with the network s size ; however , this amount of information is always smaller than the information related to the shortest path and the difference between them increases with @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that , as far as the optimal walks defined by @xmath76 are convenient , it is useful to relax the restriction of walking the shortest paths , because it is cheaper in terms of information to walk along paths which are not so short .",
    "furthermore , the relative amount of intrinsic information @xmath77 decreases with the system size ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "it means that the walker s information about the shorter paths in the network eventually becomes predominant .",
    "this is also consistent with the decrease in the value of optimal penalization @xmath45 as function of @xmath73 , which is required to learn the shorter paths ( see the inset ) .",
    "this indicates that in this topology the walker can learn efficiently the ways to the target .",
    "this example [ see fig . [ fig1](c ) ] allows to visualize one of the main motivations to generalize the approach which measures the information considering only shortest paths @xmath72@xcite to a measure that includes all the possible paths .",
    "specifically , this example allows the study of a case in which the walker has many alternatives consisting of equivalent paths that are not much longer than the shortest ones .",
    "due to its particular topology , this example can also be solved analytically for arbitrary network sizes .",
    "accordingly , applying eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) to this particular example , the following set of equations is generated : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "as usual we solve for @xmath52 and minimize , leading to @xmath80 and @xmath81 which satisfies the right limits @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath42 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 for @xmath57 .",
    "similarly to the _ star web _ , in this example the optimal information @xmath63 and the shortest paths information @xmath72 scale logarithmically with the network s size ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , and also @xmath86 but at variance with _ star web _ the difference between them remains almost constant . here",
    ", the optimal penalization @xmath45 grows with system size @xmath73 and the relative amount of intrinsic information @xmath87 is always predominant ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "these results confirm the intuitive insight that in this kind of topology it is difficult for the walker to learn the optimal walk pattern , which is related to the fact that discrimination between several similar alternatives is expensive .",
    "a comparison between this example and the previous one reveals other important differences in connection with their topologies .",
    "when dead ends prevail in a network , the optimal paths are easily achievable in an efficient way ; a small penalty is enough and the relative amount of intrinsic information is not predominant . on the other hand , if the alternative paths prevail , then the optimization procedure is inefficient ; a large penalty is required and the amount of intrinsic information is predominant .",
    "in this section we apply the ideas introduced in the previous sections to more complex network topologies . we choose two paradigmatic cases , especifically , the random and scale  free networks .",
    "since these systems can not be solved analytically , all the results we show here are obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "we performed an optimization procedure minimizing @xmath52 with respect to @xmath16 for a sequence @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a small quantity ( @xmath90 $ ] ) .",
    "this is a convenient procedure since @xmath76 varies smoothly with @xmath30 .",
    "we start by using the values given by equation ( [ eq5 ] ) as the initial guess for @xmath91 , and then we use the last minimum obtained for the subsequent values of @xmath30 .",
    "we perform the minimization using the implementation of the slsqp @xcite algorithm provided by scipy @xcite as a part of sage mathematics software @xcite .",
    "if @xmath89 is too large the minimization algorithm fails to converge since the initial guess is too far away from the minimum , even in small networks .",
    "the computational cost for solving the numerical problem of finding @xmath76 in our approach is large .",
    "the time complexity grows as a stretched exponential of the network size , @xmath92 for more details about the time complexity of the algorithm . ] . in practice , this prevents the problem from being solvable in large networks . at variance , other related problems @xcite can be solved in polinomial time .",
    "the average walk length is obtained by a monte carlo procedure using the set @xmath34 for the transition probabilities .",
    "this quantity is analyzed as a function of the penalty and the shortest path length between the sources and the target .",
    "the values of the probabilities @xmath76 depend on the target vertex @xmath11 but are independent of the source vertex @xmath10 for each value of @xmath30 .",
    "we tested this analytically in the examples of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and numerically on a small random network .",
    "let us define the vector @xmath93 whose components are the no - null values of @xmath76 . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the ratio between the dispersion of @xmath93 with respect to @xmath10 , @xmath94 , and the norm , @xmath95 , as a function of @xmath30 and for different targets @xmath11 .",
    "it is shown that this ratio is much smaller than the unity confirming the independency of @xmath76 with respect to the source .",
    "since information is an additive quantity , the relative amount of intrinsic information for the overall network can be defined , given target @xmath11 .",
    "it considers all the possible sources and hence the paths to the target @xmath11 .",
    "consequently we have @xmath96 and then the overall optimal penalization @xmath97 associated to the target @xmath11 can be obtained from this expression . for",
    "the sake of brevity let us omit the reference to @xmath11 , so we will refer to @xmath98 by @xmath99 and its optimal version @xmath100 by @xmath87 .",
    "let us first analyze the case of a random network .",
    "all the calculations in this section were performed using a network of @xmath101 vertices with an average degree @xmath102 and using a target chosen at random .",
    "care was taken to obtain a random network that consists of only one connected component . here",
    "we show results corresponding to a single realization of the target and the network , since similar results were obtained using different realizations .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows @xmath99 as function of @xmath30 obtained for this network . from this curve",
    "we obtained the optimal overall penalization @xmath103 . in this figure",
    "we also show @xmath104 , which is the relative information @xmath105 averaged over the sources that are at a fixed distance @xmath106 from the target .",
    "we obtained from these curves the optimal penalization @xmath107 ; the dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath106 is shown in the inset .",
    "we observe that @xmath107 varies with @xmath106 but in every case @xmath107 is of the same order of magnitude that @xmath97 . in order to analyze the role of the penalty in the restricted walks toward the target , we analyze typical walk lengths as function of @xmath30 .",
    "we first obtain the transition probabilities associated with the target @xmath11 , for a given @xmath30 , and then using this probabilities we implement a monte carlo process to obtain a set of trajectories corresponding to random walkers which are biased to the target .",
    "the random walkers start their journies at every possible source available in the network .",
    "when calculating the average of these trajectories we obtain the average walk length @xmath108 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot @xmath108 corresponding to the same realization of the network and target we used to obtain the results of fig .",
    "when @xmath30 approaches its minimal physical value @xmath31 the walk is fully random and the average walk length between all the possible sources and the fixed target is @xmath109 , which is at least an order of magnitude larger than the typical distance between vertices .",
    "then as @xmath30 is increased the average walk length decreases drastically .",
    "we denote by @xmath110 the average of all the shortest path that reach the target ( note that in this calculation all sources are included ) . at the optimal penalization @xmath97 the difference between the average walk length and the average shortest paths @xmath110 is nearly two times @xmath110 ; that is , the average walk length is of the same order of magnitude than the average of the shortest paths .",
    "we also computed the average walk length @xmath111 at the optimal penalization @xmath112 that correspond to averages in trajectories restricted to start at sources that are at a distance @xmath106 from the target .",

    "in addition , according to the current approach the amount of information the walker learns on average @xmath118 does not depend on @xmath106 ( inset in fig .",

    "figure [ fig9 ] shows that the walk length @xmath122 and the shortest path length @xmath123 decrease with target s degree and the decrease of the former is more pronounced .",

    "our approach is consistent since the two main quantities that determine the cost associated to the task of targeted signaling are counterbalanced : a shortening of the walk length through penalization implies an increase of the information required , and vice - versa . at this point , it is important to stress that in this scheme the penalization operates globally , limiting the overall available information , unlike other approaches @xcite in which the information at each vertex is limited .",
    "this has the advantage of overcoming the undesired effect of affecting mostly the highly connected vertices , provided the vertex s degrees are taken into account @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the idea of _ intrinsic _ information , in order to define an optimal penalization .",
    "we have shown through some network models that in practice a small amount of penalization is enough to drastically reduce the typical walk length , and then a network can be efficiently navigated with restricted information . on the other hand ,",
    "once the optimal penalization is reached it is highly expensive to further reduce the typical walk length ; in particular an infinite penalization is required to restrict the path lengths to the shortest ones .",
    "the typical walk length in a random network was analyzed and compared to the corresponding shortest path at the optimal penalization .",
    "it is found that the difference between these lengths grows linearly with the shortest path length .",
    "this is connected with a trade - off at which the amount of information does not increase with the length of the shortest paths .",
    "in addition , from the trend of @xmath140 a distance horizon can be identified which define a range of efficient searchability .",
    "it is worth stressing that the existence of an information horizon has been previouly reported in the literature . in the context of targeted signaling by trusina et al .",
    "@xcite , and in the complementary subject of efficient network diffusion by sinatra et al .",
    "@xcite where an optimimal diffusion process is attainable with local limited information .",
    "the ideas introduced in this paper were applied to undirected and unweighted networks . however , in the study of traffic on cities , directed and weighted network are needed since streets have different capacities and directions .",
    "the extension of the formalism to include directed networks is straightforward , but care must be taken to ensure that each vertex is accessible from each other vertex ; otherwise the analysis has to be restricted to each strongly connected components of the network . also the penalty scheme may be generalized to be vertex dependent . in the case of the dual representation of network s cities where vertices are streets and edges are road intersections@xcite , the traffic congestion on each street can be used to regulate the amount of penalization in order to avoid a traffic jam .",
    "although the proposed formalism requires the solution of an optimization problem which has a large computational cost , the algorithm is specially suited for a parallel implementation since each target @xmath11 can be treated separately .",
    "the authors thank sergio cannas , daniel stariolo and pablo serra for useful discussions .",
