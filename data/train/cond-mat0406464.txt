    "in recent years there was a rapid development in the growth and characterization of diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) @xcite .",
    "these materials are obtained by doping with transition metals ordinary iii - v semiconductors @xcite and recently also transition metal oxides @xcite .",
    "the novel aspect of the dms is the interplay between the electronic functionality of a semiconductor with magnetic properties .",
    "for example the possibility of tailoring the ferromagnetic curie temperature ( @xmath3 ) by electron gating has been already demonstrated @xcite .",
    "it is then clear that the measurement of a spontaneous magnetization , although good test for ferromagnetism , is not a direct proof of a material to be a dms .",
    "therefore some other measurements such as the anomalous hall effect @xcite or x - ray magnetic circular dicrohism ( xmcd ) @xcite must be used to demonstrate the interaction between the magnetic and the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "to date only a few materials , including ( ga , mn)as and ( in , mn)as , have passed convincingly this test @xcite , but unfortunately none of them present a @xmath3 above room temperature .",
    "this of course is a critical requisite for future devices .",
    "new excitement cames with the synthesis of ferromagnetic ( ga , mn)n @xcite with @xmath3 well above room temperature .",
    "high @xmath3 in this material was somehow expected after the predictions of dietl et al .",
    "@xcite , who calculated the magnetic properties of various semiconductors incorporating mn , and concluded that wide gap semiconductors might offer better possibility for high @xmath3 .",
    "dietl s calculations are based on the zener @xcite model of ferromagnetism , where the localized 5/2 spins of the mn ions are antiferromagnetically coupled with the spins of the free holes , giving rise to an effective mn - mn ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "interestingly high @xmath3 ( ga , mn)n does not show any evidence for anomalous hole effect , nor for any hysteretic xmcd signal coming from the valence gan electrons @xcite .",
    "this seems to suggest , that in the case of ( ga , mn)n the agreement with the dietl s theory is somehow coincidental .",
    "since the experimental situation is not conclusive , _ ab - initio _ methods are important for understanding the main features of these novel materials , and for establishing the validity of models based on effective hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "so far a large number of density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for a wide range of dms have been published ( see reference @xcite for a review ) .",
    "almost all the calculations to date are based on the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) and here we list the main results for ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n :    \\1 ) ( ga , mn)as is a half - metal with a magnetic moment of 4@xmath4 per mn in unit the cell @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) in ( ga , mn)as the local magnetic moment at the mn site is larger than 4@xmath4 and the fermi level lies below the top of the majority valence band .",
    "this sustains the idea of a hole with spin antiferromagnetically coupled to that of the mn .",
    "in addition an induced magnetic moment antiparallel to that of the mn is found at the as sites neighboring the mn ions .",
    "\\3 ) the hole in ( ga , mn)as has a rather large @xmath2 component as the result of a considerable @xmath1-@xmath2 interaction .",
    "\\4 ) for ( ga , mn)as an estimation of the exchange constant @xmath0 gives a value of about -4.5  ev @xcite , which is considerably larger than that given by most experimental determinations and the value used in model hamiltonian calculations @xcite .",
    "\\5 ) also ( ga , mn)n is a half - metal with a magnetization of 4@xmath4 per mn in the cell @xcite .",
    "\\6 ) the valence band of ( ga , mn)n is not spin - splitted and the fermi level lies in a rather narrow impurity band @xcite .",
    "\\7 ) the magnetic impurity band in ( ga , mn)n has a strong @xmath2 character and the magnetic moment at the mn sites is consistent with a mn @xmath5 configuration @xcite .",
    "very recently we have investigated whether some of these common features are pathological of the use of the lsda .",
    "in particular , since the lsda tends to underestimate electron localization and to overestimate the @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization , one may cast some doubts on its quantitative predictions .",
    "we have carried out electronic structure calculations for both ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n by using the self - interaction corrected lda method ( lda - sic ) @xcite .",
    "the main findings are that , on the one hand the electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as are rather similar in lsda and lda - sic , although the second predicts a much weaker @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization at the top of the valence band with consequent reduction of the valence band spin - splitting .",
    "this of course means that the exchange constant @xmath0 is smaller than that predicted by the lsda . on the other hand , for",
    "( ga , mn)n lda - sic shows a strong orbital ordering with a convincing evidence of a mn @xmath5 configuration .",
    "although this can be re - interpreted as mn @xmath6 plus a localized @xmath2 hole , it is clear that no holes are left in the gan valence band and an itinerant free - hole - mediated picture of ferromagnetism is not sustainable .",
    "unfortunately , due to its computational overheads we have not been able yet to investigate the details of the mn - mn interaction with the lda - sic method .",
    "the present paper seeks to fill this gap .",
    "we have implemented the lda+u scheme in the localized atomic orbital dft code siesta @xcite , and we have then used this novel computational capability to investigate the magnetic properties of ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n . the method , although introduces two phenomenological parameters ( the coulomb @xmath7and the exchange @xmath8 constants ) , allows us to perform large scale calculations and therefore to investigate the mn - mn interaction over a broad range of mn concentrations .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will briefly discuss our computational details and we will justify the values used for the lda+u phenomenological parameters . then we will present our results for both ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n , and finally we will conclude .",
    "details on the implementation of the lda+u method in siesta are described in the appendix .",
    "all the calculations of this work are performed with the density functional code siesta @xcite .",
    "siesta has been specially optimized to deal with very large systems .",
    "it uses a very efficient localized atomic orbital basis set @xcite and norm conserving pseudopotentials in the separate kleinman - bylander form @xcite .",
    "it is therefore ideal to simulate arrangements of hundreds and even thousands of atoms , hence dms with low mn concentrations @xcite and related systems @xcite .",
    "we use conventional scalar relativistic troulier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite with nonlinear core corrections @xcite .",
    "the reference electronic configurations for the pseudopotentials are : @xmath9",
    "( n ) , @xmath10  ( as ) , @xmath11 ( mn ) , with s / p / d cutoff radii : 1.14/1.14/1.14  a.u .",
    "( n ) , 1.9/2.18/2.5  a.u .",
    "( as ) and s / p / d / f radii for mn 1.98/2.18/1.88/1.88  a.u .",
    "we treat the 4@xmath12 and 4@xmath1 electrons of ga as valence electrons and we leave the 3@xmath2 in the core .",
    "therefore the pseudopotential is constructed for @xmath13 with s / p / d cut - off radii 2.1/2.5/2.98  a.u .",
    "we also checked whether or not the inclusion of @xmath14 electrons in the valence changes the relevant properties . in gaas , although this was shown to be important for the geometry optimization and the high pressure phases @xcite , it does not seem to be particularly relevant for the physics at the fermi level under normal pressure conditions .",
    "in contrast , in gan the 3@xmath2 states lie about 3  ev below the n-@xmath15 states @xcite .",
    "lsda sets erroneously their position within the n-@xmath15 band and one may suspect that this will affect somehow the physics at the fermi level .",
    "we fix this wrong alignment by applying @xmath16 corrections to the ga @xmath14 states and find that , although now the bands have the correct position , the fermi sphere is not modified .",
    "therefore we decided not to include ga @xmath14 states in the valence in order to save computational time and memory .",
    "note that the same choice is presently adopted in most of the calculations of this type @xcite .",
    "as far as the lattice structure is concerned , all the calculations assume the experimental geometry for both zincblende gaas ( @xmath17=5.65  ) and wurtzite gan ( @xmath18=3.189   @xmath19=5.185    and @xmath20=0.377 ) @xcite .",
    "we then perform supercell simulations , where the supercells are constructed as integer multiple of either the primitive or in the case of zincblende the cubic cell .    turning our attention to the basis set it is worth pointing out that siesta uses a flexible multiple-@xmath21 basis set @xcite of numerical atomic orbitals .",
    "our calculations use double-@xmath21 for the @xmath12 and @xmath1-shells of any element and a triple-@xmath21 basis set for the mn @xmath14-shell .",
    "details of the relevant basis cutoff radii and their optimization has been already given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "although siesta is a very powerful and flexible package , it includes only basic features to tackle magnetic systems . in particular it can only use the lsda or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange correlation potential . no schemes to deal with strong electron correlations",
    "are included .",
    "since we believe that these may play an important rle in determining the magnetic properties of iii - v dms , we decided to implement the lda+u scheme in siesta , using the functional proposed by anisimov et al .",
    "details of the implementations are discussed in the appendix .",
    "since the lda+u method is essentially empirical , in the sense that the values of the coulomb and exchange constants @xmath16 and @xmath8 must be provided , we have explored several choices of these parameters .",
    "our fitting criterion was to choose @xmath16 and @xmath8 in order to obtain the best energy position of the mn @xmath2 band compared with that of available photoemission data @xcite .",
    "this fit fixes @xmath16 and @xmath8 respectively to 4.5  ev and 1.0  ev .",
    "in addition to the correct positioning of the mn @xmath2 band we find that this set of parameters also reproduces accurately the band structure of ( ga , mn)as that we have obtained with the lda - sic method @xcite . finally it is worth noting that the results are not strongly dependent on the values of @xmath8 ( within a reasonable range ) and that we have assumed that the same set of parameters can be used also for mn in ( ga , mn)n . here",
    "we also present some results for @xmath22  ev in order to give a better explanation of the trends .",
    "a schematic hamiltonian for describing the main interaction in iii - v dms is as follows @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian for the host semiconductor and @xmath0 is the exchange constant between the mn spin @xmath25 and the spin @xmath26 of some type of carriers . when the relevant carriers are holes this hamiltonian leads to two possible scenarios depending on the magnitude of @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the valence band bandwidth . in the case of @xmath29 the mn - mn coupling",
    "is mediated by free carriers and can be treated in term of the mean - field zener @xcite model .",
    "in contrast if @xmath30 an impurity band forms at the top of the valence band with a strong mn @xmath2 character and the effective coupling is double - exchange like @xcite .",
    "finally in the case @xmath31 , when the hole are strongly localized at the mn sites , a magnetic polaron can form and the interaction is expected to be rather short range and described by percolation theory @xcite . in addition to this picture , if the mn @xmath2 levels lie at midgap with weak coupling with the carriers of either the conduction or valence band of the host semiconductor , the entire use of the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) can be questioned and the ferromagnetism might be described by a zhang - rice polaron @xcite .",
    "one of the aim of this work is to distinguish between these multiple options .      in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the density of the states ( dos ) for 3.125% ( ga , mn)as obtained with the lsda and the lda+u schemes respectively .",
    "= 8.0 cm    both methods result in a half - metal with a magnetic moment of 4@xmath4 per mn in the cell .",
    "the difference between lsda and lda+u is in the position of the mn - derived @xmath2 dos and its contribution to the top of the majority spin valence band .",
    "lda+u shifts the center on the majority mn @xmath2 band to lower energies and now the dos shows a strong mn-@xmath2 peak at about 4  ev below fermi level ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "this is a feature that agrees perfectly with the photoemission spectra of reference @xcite .",
    "moreover this downshift changes the contribution of the mn @xmath2 levels to the dos at @xmath32 which is substantial in the lsda ( 18  % of the total dos at @xmath32 ) and small in the lda+u ( 7  % ) .",
    "these features are a consequence of the enhanced localization of the mn @xmath2 shells in real space .",
    "the magnetic moment per mn atom calculated from the mlliken population analysis @xcite is 4.21  @xmath4 for lsda and 4.71@xmath4 for lda+u with @xmath16=4.5",
    "lda+u therefore gives a clear confirmation of the mn @xmath6 configuration .",
    "in addition there is always an induced magnetic moment at the as sites , which is antiparallel to that of the mn ion . in this case",
    "the lsda and lda+u behaviors are somehow different . in lsda",
    "we find a rapid decay of the induced magnetic moment with the distance between the as and the mn ions .",
    "this is 0.068  @xmath33 for the first neighbor , 0.011  @xmath33 for the second , 0.006  @xmath33 for the third .",
    "in contrast lda+u gives a larger magnetic moment for the first neighbor ( 0.106  @xmath33 ) , but then this becomes almost constant with the distance from the mn ion ( @xmath340.015  @xmath33 ) .",
    "finally it is worth noting that the lda+u pushes the unoccupied mn @xmath2 states in the minority band to higher energies and therefore the minority conduction band bottom changes from @xmath2-like to @xmath35-like . despite aforementioned features",
    ", it seems that taking into account strong coulomb interaction in the mn @xmath14 shell , does not change much the qualitative lsda picture of ( ga , mn)as near @xmath32 . in order to appreciate the differences between the two schemes and",
    "distinguish between the different scenarios described at the beginning of this section we need to investigate in more details the magnetic interaction .",
    "we first decide to evaluate the mn-@xmath2/free - hole exchange constant @xmath0 . before starting",
    "we would like to note that @xmath0 is not a physical observable .",
    "therefore it can not be measured directly but must be inferred from some other quantity .",
    "in particular the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) solved within the mean field approximation , leads to the prediction of a linear dependence of the spin - splitting of the valence band @xmath36 upon the mn concentration @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the average spin of the mn site ( 5/2 assuming a mn @xmath6 configuration ) @xcite .",
    "this is a quantity that can be easily calculated within our approach .",
    "of course the idea of extracting @xmath0 from the equation ( [ nb ] ) underpins the assumption that dft and the hamiltonian @xmath40 solved in the mean field approximation lead to the same physics .",
    "= 9.0 cm    in figure [ fig2 ] , we present @xmath36 for @xmath37 equal to 0.021 , 0.031 , 0.042 , 0.063 , and 0.125 obtained by substituting one ga atom with mn in supercells containing respectively 96 , 64 , 48 , 32 , and 16 atoms .",
    "it is easy to note that the slope of the linear dependence of @xmath36 upon @xmath37 decreases when going from lsda to lda+u , and furthermore it becomes smaller as @xmath16 gets larger .",
    "we also note that only in the case of @xmath16=4.5  ev the linear interpolation presents the correct limit @xmath41 for @xmath42 , while this is not found for the lsda or for other values of @xmath16 .",
    "although simple multiple scattering corrections which reproduce the appropriate behaviour for @xmath42 can be added to our analysis @xcite , this is an interesting result in itself .",
    "in fact the value of @xmath16=4.5  ev gives also the correct position of the mn @xmath2 states , and produces band structure that closely agrees with those calculated with our parameter free lda - sic method @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the lda+u method with @xmath16=4.5  ev and @xmath8=1  ev accurately describes the electronic structures of ( ga , mn)as , which in turn is also consistent with the mean field theory @xcite .",
    "we then extract the value of @xmath0 using the equation ( [ nb ] ) . in doing this",
    "we have observed that , although it is possible to fit very accurately for either large ( @xmath37=0.031 , 0.042 , 0.063 and 0.125 ) or small ( @xmath37=0.021 , 0.031 , 0.042 , and 0.063 ) mn concentrations , a good fit over the whole concentration range is not satisfactory . this is somehow expected since for small concentrations multiple scattering corrections are relevant and for large the mn ions can not be considered as a small perturbation to the gaas electronic structure .",
    "we therefore always calculate two values of @xmath0 corresponding to the two different fits .    in this way we find @xmath43  ev for lda+u ( @xmath444.5  ev ) , which must be put in relation with the values of @xmath45  ev and @xmath46  ev extracted respectively from the lsda and from lda+u with @xmath16=8  ev .",
    "we believe that our value of @xmath47 - 2.8  ev is the appropriate value to use in the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "let us point out the exact meaning of our statement .",
    "we state that in a perfectly ordered , defect - free ( ga , mn)as crystal , where every mn ion occupies a ga site and therefore donates a local spin 5/2 and a hole , the spin splitting of the valence band will be that given in figure  [ fig2 ] for @xmath16=4.5  ev .",
    "then , if we also suppose that @xmath36 can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath40 of equation ( [ hh ] ) , the correct `` bare '' value for @xmath48 is in the range @xmath43  ev .",
    "in contrast if one wants to extract a value of @xmath48 from experimental data it must be remembered that the actual value entering in the definition of the observables ( for instance the band spin - splitting ) is not the `` bare '' one , but an `` effective '' value that somehow takes into account effects such as disorder , presence of compensating defects and so on .",
    "therefore it should not be surprising that these values do not agree with the `` bare '' one obtained here , and that the measurements of different observables give different values of @xmath48 .",
    "magnetotransport gives values ranging from 1.5 ev @xcite to 3.3 ev @xcite , exciton splitting gives @xmath0=2.5  ev @xcite and core level photoemission @xmath0=-1.2  ev @xcite .",
    "to further investigate the effects of strong on - site correlation on the electronic structure of ( ga , mn)as we have analyzed the effective mn - mn interaction .",
    "as usual we consider supercells where we now include two mn ions per cell @xcite .",
    "we calculate the total energy of the cell either imposing a ferromagnetic ( @xmath49 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath50 ) alignment of the magnetization of the mn ions",
    ". then our total energy calculations are fitted to a simple heisenberg model , in which the energy can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the exchange constant as a function of the mn - mn separation @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the mn spin at site @xmath55 .",
    "here we assume @xmath56 independently on the atomic position .",
    "this is consistent with the magnetic moment per mn obtained from our dft calculations .",
    "moreover we consider @xmath57 to be rather short ranged by setting @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "our results for @xmath60 for both lsda and lda+u with @xmath16=4.5  ev as a function of the mn - mn separation are presented in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm    both lsda and lda+u show a decay of the magnetic coupling strength between two mn ions as their separation increases .",
    "in addition we also observe some oscillating behaviour .",
    "this is expected when dealing with a carrier - mediated ferromagnetism , although our @xmath57 can not be fitted to an rkky - like expression due to the lack of antiferromagnetic interaction ( positive @xmath8 s ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that our results are rather similar to those obtained previously with lsda @xcite , which have been interpreted in term of ferromagnetic paths through as sites .",
    "the main difference between the lsda and the lda+u results is a substantial reduction of the mn - mn interaction when strong correlation is included .",
    "a rough estimation of the possible @xmath3 can be obtained by using the mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "this involves the sum of the exchange parameters over all the cation sites . from figure [ fig3 ]",
    "it is then clear that lda+u predicts a @xmath3 for @xmath346% ( ga , mn)as considerably smaller than that predicted by lsda .    in conclusion for ( ga , mn)as both lsda and lda+u give a picture of hole - mediated ferromagnetism . however the inclusion of strong on - site repulsion at the mn sites reduces the @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization at the top of the valence band with a consequent reduction of the effective mn - mn interaction .",
    "the bandstructure and the corresponding dos for ( ga , mn)n with a mn concentration of 3.125% ( 1 mn ion in a 64 atom gan cell ) are presented respectively in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    for both lsda and lda+u and in contrast with zincblende ( ga , mn)as , in the wurtzite ( ga , mn)n the mn @xmath2-derived states appear in the middle of the gan gap in the majority spin band .",
    "the fermi level cuts through a triplet with mainly mn @xmath2 and n @xmath1 character and no free holes are left in the valence band , which in turn does not spin split .    from the pictures it is clear that also ( ga , mn)n is a half - metal with a total magnetization of the unit cell of 4 @xmath61 , as in the ( ga , mn)as case .",
    "however for ( ga , mn)n the mlliken population gives us a magnetic moment per mn ion of 3.74  @xmath33 and 3.86  @xmath33 respectively for lsda and lda+u .",
    "this is consistent with a mn @xmath5 configuration and a fermi surface dominated by @xmath2 like holes .",
    "going into the details of the bandstructure we note that the triplet state at the fermi level is made mainly from mn @xmath2 states with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 symmetry , while the doublet is primarily made from mn @xmath65 and @xmath66 states .",
    "the @xmath67-axis has been taken here along the c - axis of the wurtzite structure .",
    "this can be easily seen from the density of states projected on the mn @xmath2 shells ( figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) and it is a direct consequence of the hexagonal crystal field splitting .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    there are two main differences when going from lsda to lda+u .",
    "first with lda+u the @xmath65-@xmath66 doublet disappears at the top of the gan valance band , leaving only the triplet in the bandgap , which shifts closer to the valence band top .",
    "secondly lda+u enhances the orbital ordering of the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 triplet .",
    "in fact , while with lsda this is a mixture of all the three orbital components , with the fermi level cutting through a peak with strong @xmath68 character , in lda+u the fermi level lies below the @xmath68 peak leaving a strongly localized @xmath68 hole .",
    "secondly in lda+u there is a general reduction of the mn @xmath2 component of the dos at the fermi level , with an increase of the n @xmath1 component .",
    "in fact by integrating the orbital resolved dos over the @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 triplet , we calculate that the relative contribution to the dos coming from the mn @xmath2 shells is 55% and 36% respectively for lsda and lda+u .",
    "these features suggest that the main effects of the hubbard @xmath16 corrections are an increase of the localization of the mn @xmath2 electrons associated with a reduction of both the on - site @xmath2 hybridization and the mn @xmath2-n @xmath1 coupling .",
    "a similar behaviour has also been found with the lda - sic method @xcite .",
    "however in the lda - sic case the orbital ordering in much stronger producing a complete split of the triplet into an occupied doublet and an empty singlet ( with mainly @xmath68 character ) .",
    "we have tried several values of @xmath16 and @xmath8 in order to reproduce the lda - sic result , without success .",
    "the main difference between the two calculations is that in the case of lda - sic all the orbitals , including those of ga and n , are corrected .",
    "the resulting band gap of gan is almost twice as big as that obtained with the simple lsda .",
    "this means that the lda - sic and lda+u calculations start from an host semiconductor with a rather different band gap giving rise to a more pronounced orbital ordering in the lda - sic case . in support to this hypothesis it is worth reporting that novel lda - sic calculations @xcite , performed by subtracting the self - interaction only from the mn @xmath2 orbitals , give very similar results than our present lda+u .    also for ( ga , mn)n we investigate the presence of an induced magnetic moment at the n sites . in this case",
    "the situation is rather different from that of ( ga , mn)as . lsda calculations show very little magnetic moment at any n sites , including nearest mn neighbors where the induced magnetic moment is only 0.03  @xmath33 and parallel to that of the mn ion .",
    "also lda+u gives small induced magnetic moments ( 0.098  @xmath33 for the first neighbor sites , then smaller than 0.008  @xmath33 for any other n ) , however those are antiparallel to that of the mn ions .",
    "more interestingly the occupation of the four n ions in the mnn@xmath69 tetrahedron is rather sensitive to whether the n ion is placed along the wurtzite @xmath19 axis ( _ top _",
    "n ) or in the opposite plane ( _ in - plane _",
    "the induced magnetic moment is given solely by the @xmath70 orbital for the n top ion , and only by the @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals for the in plane n. however , in contrast with the previous lda - sic results @xcite , in the present case the induced n magnetic moment is always antiparallel to that of the mn .      from the previous analysis",
    "it is clear that the bandstructure does not support a conventional zener - like picture of the ferromagnetism , since no free holes are present in the gan valence band .",
    "therefore a careful investigation of the ferromagnetic coupling between mn ions is needed .",
    "also in this case we consider supercells where we include two mn ions at different mutual positions , and we investigate the energy difference between the ferro- and antiferromagnetic alignment of the mn ions .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 5.5 cm    we explore several possible geometrical configurations , by using both a 32 and a 64 atom unit cell . the first mn ion is always placed in the corner of the supercell and we allow the second to occupy different positions .",
    "those possible configurations are schematically presented in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "also in this case we have fit our dft energy calculations to the heisenberg hamiltonian of equation ( [ heisen ] ) . in this case",
    "we use @xmath73 and we have set @xmath58 for @xmath74 .",
    "a summary of the results for all the mn positions studied here is presented in table [ planes ] and in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm    from our data it is clear that the lda+u gives a ferromagnetic coupling with rather different features than that given by the lsda . in particular when going from lsda to lda+u there is a large enhancement of the @xmath8 for nearest mn neighbours ( case a and b ) , while all the other @xmath8 s are either unchanged or reduced . a second interesting aspect is the dependence of @xmath57 over the mn concentration .",
    "also in this case lsda and lda+u give a rather different behaviour . in lsda",
    "all the exchange constants increase as the mn concentration becomes smaller , while the lda+u gives an increase of the nearest neighbour constants and almost no dependence on concentration for all the other constants .",
    "this severe dependence of the @xmath8 s on the mn - mn distance , with a strong coupling at short mn - mn separation and weak long - range tails , suggests that high @xmath3 can be achieved only at reasonably large mn concentrations , when it is more likely to have several mn ions occupying nearest neighbouring positions .",
    "this leads us to speculate that the ferromagnetic state occurs in ferromagnetic clusters ( with wurtzite lattice structure ) , presenting very large mn concentration . within the clusters the ferromagnetic state",
    "is stabilized by the strong nearest neighbour ferromagnetic interaction , while the cluster - cluster coupling remains weak .",
    "therefore our lda+u calculations support the hypothesis of two ferromagnetic phases in ( ga , mn)n @xcite : a high @xmath3 phase characterized by large mn concentrations , and a diluted low @xmath3 phase .    cccccc + position & @xmath2 (  ) & @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 & @xmath78 +   + a ( 0 ) & 3.189 & 5.03 & 27.00 & 29.50 & 42.80 + b ( 1 ) & 3.179 & 12.30 & 32.99 & 30.00 & 52.23 + c ( 2 ) & 5.185 & 2.50 & 1.14 & 5.66 & 1.52 + d ( 0 ) & 4.510 & 2.48 & 3.87 & 4.98 & 3.56 + e ( 1 ) & 4.504 & 2.50 & 2.90 & 10.18 & 1.08 + f ( 2 ) & 6.088 & 2.75 & 3.50 & 15.83 & 9.05 + g ( 0 ) & 6.378 & 3.88 & 5.57 & 6.15 & 5.73 + h ( 1 ) & 5.518 & 2.04 & 3.33 & 6.55 & 3.16 +    to gain more insights into the nature of the ferromagnetic coupling we have studied in great details the electronic structure of various supercells containing two mn ions . here we focus only on the case of nearest neighbour mn ions , which are the ones presenting the larger exchange constants , and in particular on the case a. in figure [ fig11 ] we present the dos for both 64 and 32 atom cell containing two mn ions in the position a. the picture shows the results obtained with lsda ( top four panels ) and lda+u ( bottom four panels ) for both the parallel ( right panels ) and antiparallel ( left panel ) alignments of the mn spins .",
    "= 7.0 cm    from the picture it is clear that the ferromagnetic state becomes more stable when the ferromagnetic configuration presents a large spin - gap , i.e. when there is little overlap between the two mn derived spin sub - bands .",
    "this is the case of lda+u for both the concentrations studied , where we find a spin - gap of the order of @xmath341.5  ev .",
    "moreover in lda+u this spin - gap appears to be rather insensitive to the mn concentration ( although it clearly increases when going from @xmath37=12.5% to @xmath37=6.25% ) , which reflects the corresponding weak dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast in the lsda case there is a substantial overlap between the majority and the minority mn @xmath2 bands , in particular at large mn concentrations .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the broadening of the mn @xmath2 states , upon increasing concentration .",
    "it is worth noting that in our 32 atom cell each mn ion has two mn neighbours separated only by one n site forming a mn - n chain , whereas in the 64 atom cell mn - n - mn trimers are separated by two n sites .",
    "the large broadening obtained for @xmath37=12.5% closes almost entirely the spin gap , resulting in a rather weak ferromagnetic coupling between the mn .",
    "these findings can be understood in terms of competition between the super- and double - exchange mechanisms @xcite . in absence of any holes the coupling between two mn ions",
    "is expected to be antiferromagnetic due to the super - exchange coupling , as it was recently verified @xcite .",
    "this coupling is extremely short ranged and one has to assume that mn ions separated by more than one n site are magnetically decoupled .",
    "doping such a system will generally produce a distortion of the antiferromagnetic coupling , eventually leading to a ferromagnetic ground state for large enough dopants concentration .",
    "the `` melting '' of the antiferromagnetic state is connected with the fact that the additional electrons ( or holes ) are exchange coupled with the local spin of the transition metal impurities . in this case",
    "the wave - function of such electrons depends on the magnetic configuration of the transition metal ions , and in particular it will be localized when those are aligned along different directions .",
    "the formation of a ferromagnetic state will enhance the delocalization of the additional electrons providing a net gain in band energy .",
    "the final ground state is then the result of the competition between the energy gain due to the electron delocalization and the energy loss due to direct mn - mn super - exchange .",
    "therefore in ( ga , mn)n the ferromagnetic ground state is directly connected with the presence of a hole in the mn - derived impurity band .",
    "however in the case of small spin - splitting of the mn @xmath2 states , virtual hopping of the holes between antiferromagnetically oriented mn ions becomes possible and their kinetic energy can be lowered without producing a ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this is why the lsda calculations for large mn doping present a rather small ferromagnetic interaction between the mn ions .",
    "in addition this enhanced hopping between antiferromagnetically aligned mn ions produces a reduction of the mn magnetic moment . for the @xmath37=12.5% case lsda",
    "shows a magnetic moment of the mn @xmath2 shell ( obtained from the mlliken population ) of 3.9@xmath4 and 3.2@xmath4 respectively for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configuration .",
    "this is indeed very different from the lda+u case , where the local magnetic moment changes little with the mutual mn alignment .",
    "we have performed the same analysis over all the configurations studied with very similar conclusions . in the other case of short mn - mn distance ( case b )",
    "the tiny differences with the case a are due to the different effective mn - mn hopping integral .",
    "this is expected since the hopping integral depends on the specific orbitals forming the bond and ultimately on the path connecting the two mn ions .",
    "this gives rise to a weak anisotropy in the magnetic coupling .",
    "finally for mn ions separated by more than one n site the coupling is always rather small due to the small hopping integral .",
    "we have investigated extensively the mechanism for the ferromagnetic coupling in ( ga , mn)as and ( ga , mn)n , by using density functional theory in both the standard lsda and our newly implemented lda+u method .    for ( ga , mn)as lda+u qualitatively does not change the general picture given by lsda .",
    "both methods confirm a strong @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization leading to a spin - splitting of the valence band of gaas . in this case",
    "a hole mediated zener model for the ferromagnetism is appropriate . after having fixed the coulomb and exchange constants @xmath16 and @xmath8 to values that reproduce accurately both the position of the mn @xmath2 shell coming from photoemission data @xcite and the spin - splitting of the gaas valence band coming from the lda - sic method @xcite , we have estimated the zener mean - field exchange parameter @xmath0 to be @xmath79  ev .",
    "we believe this is the correct value that should be used in model hamiltonian calculations .",
    "then we moved our attention to ( ga , mn)n . in this case the addition of the on - site @xmath16 corrections result in a very strong , short range , ferromagnetic coupling between the mn ions .",
    "this is rather anisotropic and decays quickly with the mn - mn separation .",
    "the strong ferromagnetic interaction is double - exchange - like and is associated with the creation of a wide mn-@xmath2/n-@xmath1 impurity band at the fermi level .",
    "these features sustain a picture of the ferromagnetism where a high @xmath3 ferromagnetic phase given by regions with large mn concentration , co - exist with a low @xmath3 ferromagnetic phase given by small mn concentration regions .",

    "the lda+u method combines lsda density functional theory with the impurity anderson model .",
    "the main idea is to divide the electronic states into two subsystems : localized ( generally @xmath2 or @xmath80 ) and delocalized electrons ( generally @xmath12 and @xmath1 ) . in what follows",
    "we always refer to the localized orbitals as @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "then the lda+u philosophy consists in replacing the averaged ( lsda ) coulomb and exchange interactions acting on the localized shells , by an orbital dependent hartree - fock - like hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the generalized lda+u functional is defined as follows : @xmath81=e^{lsda}[\\rho^\\sigma(\\vec{r})]+e^{u}[\\{n^\\sigma\\ } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & -e^{dc}[\\{n^\\sigma\\}]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the standard lsda functional , @xmath83 is the charge density for the spin @xmath84 electrons , and @xmath85 is the reduced density matrix corresponding to the orbitals we need to correct . finally @xmath86 and @xmath87 are respectively the new hubbard - like functional and the double counting correction .",
    "@xmath87 is necessary to eliminate the averaged electron - electron interaction within the @xmath2 shell , which is already included in e@xmath88 .",
    "following anisimov et al .",
    "the total energy of a spin polarized system can be written as @xmath89 + \\nonumber \\\\ & & j[n^{\\uparrow}(n^{\\uparrow}-1)/2 + n^{\\downarrow}(n^{\\downarrow}-1)/2 ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are total number of , respectively , spin - up and spin - down electrons occupying the @xmath2 shell , and @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the orbital occupation numbers , which are calculated self - consistently within the lda+u approach .",
    "it is assumed in the spirit of the lda+u approximation that the total occupations of the @xmath2 shell @xmath94 are identical within lsda and lda+u .",
    "this assumption justifies the definition of the double counting term , @xmath87 .",
    "the index @xmath95 runs over the magnetic quantum number .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath8 are respectively the coulomb and the exchange interaction constants , that in principle can be calculated as the two - electron matrix elements of the atomic electron - electron interaction potential , @xmath96 @xmath97 the effective lda+u potential in then obtained by taking the functional derivative of the total energy @xmath98 with respect to the orbital density @xmath99 .",
    "this yields : @xmath100 in our implementation we assume @xmath16 and @xmath8 to be independent from the magnetic quantum number @xmath95 , although of course they can be different for @xmath2 and @xmath80 shells .",
    "hence if @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the equation above becomes @xmath103 with @xmath104 the average orbital occupations of the correlated shell @xmath105 and @xmath106 the orbital quantum number .    from the potential of equation ( [ ourv ] )",
    "one can extract an intuitive picture of the effects of strong correlations on the one - particle energy levels .",
    "we have @xmath107 where @xmath92 are the lda+u orbital occupations . in the simple formula above the single particle energies of the occupied and unoccupied orbitals",
    "are shifted respectively by @xmath108 and @xmath109 reproducing qualitatively the correct physics of a mott - hubbard insulator .",
    "we turn now our attention to the numerical implementation of this method in siesta .",
    "this is quite straightforward since siesta uses localized atomic orbital basis set @xcite .",
    "let us call these non - orthogonal basis functions @xmath110 .",
    "the two - center overlap integrals , @xmath111 , are then given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the atomic centers , and the density matrix in our atomic functions representation is denoted as @xmath115 .",
    "the occupation number of a given atomic orbital @xmath95 is then defined as follows : @xmath116    the additional potential of equation ( [ ourv ] ) is an operator @xmath117 of the form @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the scalar defined in equation ( [ ourv ] ) and @xmath120 is the projector on the molecular state @xmath95 with spin @xmath84 .",
    "assuming @xmath121 to be one of our basis function the matrix element of the lda+u potential can be written as @xmath122 in this case we use a multiple-@xmath21 basis set for the localized shell , and we construct the lda+u projector from one of the @xmath21 .",
    "the cut - off radius of this particular basis function is usually much shorter than that of the other basis functions , and in this work we have used projectors with a cut - off radius of 2.2  bohr .",
