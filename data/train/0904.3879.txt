    "dwarf novae ( dne ) are a class of non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) in which a white dwarf ( wd ) accretes matter from a main - sequence star ( the _ secondary _ ) filling its roche lobe by means of an accretion disk .",
    "dn systems are characterized mainly by their brightness variations , due to a periodic change in the accretion rate .",
    "ongoing accretion at a low rate ( quiescence ) is interrupted every few weeks to months by intense accretion ( outburst ) of days to weeks which increases the luminosity of the system @xcite .",
    "this outburst is believed to be due to an instability in the disk ( the disk instability model - dim @xcite ) , and it is known as a _ dwarf nova _ accretion event ( or dwarf nova outburst ) .    due to their long term accretion , the wds in dne have temperatures @xmath8k ( higher than field wds ) , and therefore peak in the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) .",
    "the long periods of quiescence allow for long exposure observations ( @xmath9hrs ) covering all the orbital phases ( this is especially important for systems with a high inclination , as the wd can be eclipsed or masked at given orbital phases ) . because of that , dne , unlike other cvs , are ideal candidates to study the accreting wd , as during quiescence the wd is exposed in the fuv for long periods of time .",
    "fuv spectroscopic observations are used to determine the wd parameters such as temperature , gravity , rotational velocity and chemical abundances .",
    "the disk mass accretion rate of many systems can also be deduced accurately at given epochs of outburst or near outburst using spectral fitting techniques .",
    "in addition , dne offer a fairly reliable estimate of their distances via the absolute magnitude at maximum versus orbital period relation @xcite . as a consequence , dne",
    "are ideal candidates to observe , as one can more easily derive their system parameters , which in turn can be used to test the theories of cv evolution .",
    "dwarf nova systems are further divided into sub - types : u gem systems , su uma systems , and z cam systems .",
    "the u gem systems are the typical dne , i.e. with normal dn outbursts ; the su umas exhibit both normal dn outbursts , and superoutbursts , which are both longer in duration and higher in luminosity than normal dn outbursts ; and the z cam systems have standstills where they remain in a semi - outburst state for a long time @xcite .",
    "the binary orbital period in cv systems ranges from a fraction of an hour to about a day ; however , there is a gap in the orbital period between 2 and 3 hours where almost no cv systems are found : the _ period gap_. u gem and z cam dn systems are found above the period gap , while the su uma dn systems are found below the period gap .    in this paper",
    "we present the fuv spectral analysis of the eclipsing z cam system em cygni observed during quiescence with _",
    "first suspected to be related to cvs by @xcite , em cyg is a bright , double - lined spectroscopic binary variable @xcite .",
    "its eclipses were discovered by @xcite and the orbital period was found to be almost 7h ( 0.29090912 day ) .",
    "its period was expected to decrease ( by @xmath10 days / cycle ; @xcite ) , however it has been found to be constant @xcite with an upper limit @xmath11/days .",
    "its outburst cycle is of the order of 25 days and rapid coherent oscillations are detected during the late stages of outbursts with periods of the order of 14.6 - 16.5 seconds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "em cyg is so far the only known z cam subtype eclipsing dn system .",
    "the eclipses are important as they allow , in theory at least , for a detailed study of the system .",
    "in addition , because em cyg is an eclipsing system as well as a double - lined spectroscopic binary , it has been extensively studied ( e.g. @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the determination of the stellar masses of the system by @xcite and @xcite was effected by the presence of a third star , _ arkadash _ , along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "this third star is not related to the system .",
    "the most recent study @xcite indicates a mass ratio @xmath12 and a wd mass @xmath13 . the distance found by @xcite , @xmath14320 - 350pc ,",
    "could also be affected by the contribution of arkadash in the red light , and @xcite pointed out that @xmath15 could be as large as @xmath9450 - 500pc .",
    "however , using the maximum magnitude at outburst versus orbital period relation @xcite , one finds a distance of @xmath16pc @xcite .",
    "a recent broad - band photometric study of the system @xcite shows the magnitude of em cyg varies between v=13.3 at minimum and v=12.5 at maximum , it reaches v=14.4 during the eclipse , and v=12.9 in standstill ( note , however , that data from the aavso indicates it can reach v@xmath912.0 ) .",
    "em cyg is located at a very low galactic latitude ( @xmath17 ) , where the galactic reddening reaches almost 0.5 .",
    "however , the reddening towards em cyg is only @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the system has an inclination @xmath19 of _ only _",
    "@xmath20deg @xcite , however , because of its large disk and secondary star , the disk is partially eclipsed , while the wd itself is not eclipsed .",
    "the geometrical configuration of the disk , wd and secondary of the system is shown in figure 1 at phase @xmath21 .",
    "all the system parameters are recapitulated in table 1 .",
    "em cyg was observed in quiescence with _ fuse _ by @xcite , who carried out a spectral fit after combining the _ fuse _ spectrum with an _ iue _ spectrum .",
    "their spectral fit consists of a disk with @xmath22/yr and a @xmath23 wd with @xmath24k , assuming a distance of 350pc .",
    "the model did not fit the flux in the short wavelengths of _ fuse _ which is indicative of a much higher temperature .",
    "however at @xmath25k the model spectrum became too blue and the fit was noticeably worse in the _ iue _ range .",
    "@xcite carried out a spectral fit to the _ iue _ spectrum swp 08088 of em cyg taken in quiescence ( with a flux of @xmath26ergs@xmath27@xmath28@xmath29 ) and obtained that the best fit is a disk with @xmath30/yr and a wd of @xmath31 with @xmath32k ( contributing only 8% of the flux ) with a distance of 210pc and @xmath33 .",
    "later on , @xcite analyzed the same _ iue _ spectrum and obtained the same results except a distance of 350pc , when dereddening the spectrum assuming e(b - v)=0.05 .",
    "@xcite analyzed the _ iue _ spectrum swp 07297 of em cyg in outburst assuming d=350pc , @xmath33 , and obtained that the flux comes mostly from a disk with @xmath34/year .",
    "in the spectral analysis of @xcite and @xcite only the _ iue _ spectra of em cyg in quiescence was modeled .",
    "while in the work of @xcite the fitting of the short wavelength range of _ fuse _",
    "( @xmath35 ) was not carried out satisfactorily ( as pointed out by @xcite themselves ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to carry out a spectral fit to the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg in quiescence including the short wavelength range , and to obtain the physical parameters of the exposed wd .",
    "we give particular importance to the orbital phase at which the individual _ fuse _ exposures were obtained .",
    "we show that at particular orbital phases the wd might be veiled by the stream from the first lagrangian point overflowing the disk .",
    "we remark that previous estimates might have modeled a flux attenuated by as much as 75% , and consequently obtained a low wd temperature .",
    "we model here the _ fuse _ spectrum of the wd when veiling is minimum and obtain a temperature @xmath36k and possibly as high as 50,000k .    in the next section we present the four individual _",
    "fuse _ exposures and compare them with the _ iue _ spectra taken in quiescence ; in section 3 we review the stream - disk interaction and in particular we check the possibility of the stream overflowing the disk ; in section 4 we describe the synthetic stellar spectral code as well as our fitting technique ; the results are presented in section 5 ; and a discussion with our conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the _ fuse _ data of em cyg were obtained on 2002 sep 5 ( hjd2452522 - 3 , when the system was in a low state , see figure 2 ) through the 30``x30 '' lwrs large square aperture in time tag mode . the data were processed with the latest and final version of calfuse ( v3.2.0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we process the _ fuse _ data as in @xcite , and details of the procedure can be found there .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg consists of 4 individual exposures ( one per orbit ) . for the purpose of line identifications we present the averaged spectrum in figure 3 .",
    "we identify many ism molecular hydrogen absorption lines as well as some of the metal lines usually seen in the _ fuse _ spectra of accreting wds .",
    "the metal lines we identify are as follows : + - the siii ( 1021  ) , siv ( 1062 & 1073  ) , svi ( 945  ) lines and ovi doublet , all indicative of a higher temperature @xmath37k and much higher ; + - the siiii ( 1114   ) , siiv ( 1122   ) , and nii ( 1085   ) lines , sometimes indicative of a lower temperature @xmath38k , but not inconsistent with a higher temperature ; + - the ciii ( 1175  ) absorption line , present at all wd temperatures , as long as the carbon abundance is a fraction of its solar value . + the cii ( 1010 & 1066 ) absorption lines , seen at lower temperatures ( @xmath39k ) , are not detected here ( though the cii ( 1010 ) could be contaminated with ism molecular absorption ) .",
    "there are some broad emission features from ciii ( 977  ) , and the ovi doublet .",
    "the ciii ( 1175  ) presents a p - cygni profile .",
    "the sharper absorption lines are from the ism and possibly also from circumbinary material .",
    "it is likely that the nitrogen absorption lines ( ni & nii ) are contaminated with terrestrial absorption .",
    "all these lines are marked and identified in figure 3 .",
    "there are a few additional absorption features / lines that we can not identify , mainly in the longer wavelengths ( these lines are not labeled in the lower panel of figure 3 ) .",
    "the sharp emission lines are from air glow ( geo- and helio - coronal in origin ) .",
    "the broad ly@xmath40 absorption feature is not clearly seen , pointing to a high temperature , some broad oxygen doublet emission contamination , and/or possibly a rotational velocity broadening from a disk component . in the short wavelengths ( @xmath41 )",
    "the flux does not go to zero and the continuum there is about 1/3 of the flux at longer wavelengths ( @xmath42 ) , indicative of a high temperature and consistent with the presence of higher ionization metal lines .",
    "as mentioned , this _ fuse _ spectrum consists of 4 individual exposures taken during 4 consecutive orbits of the _ fuse _ telescope .",
    "the four exposures correspond to the binary phases @xmath430.45 , 0.65 , 0.90 , and 0.15 , where @xmath44 corresponds to the eclipse @xcite .",
    "the observations log for the individual _ fuse _ exposures is given in table 2 .",
    "using an analysis of the lines in the four individual _ fuse _ exposures , @xcite explicitly showed how the radial velocity changes as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "however , they did not consider the variation of the continuum flux level from exposure to exposure , i.e. the variation of the fuv flux as a function of the orbital phase . in figure 4",
    "we show how the flux varies from exposure to exposure , and this change is also registered in the visual magnitude of the system as shown in data from the aavso in figure 2 .",
    "we find that at phases 0.15 & 0.45 ( exposures 4 & 1 ) the _ fuse _ continuum flux is larger ( by up to a factor three ) than at phases 0.65 & 0.90 ( exposures 2 & 3 ) .    in order to understand the variation of the fuv flux , in figures 5 we show the binary configuration at the times",
    "the 4 _ fuse _ exposures were obtained . from the orbital configuration",
    "we see that the flux in exposures 2 & 3 is attenuated when the hot spot region and the stream overflow region are in front of the observer . in the next subsection we carry out an examination of the iue spectra of em cyg , and we find that they too present some flux variation as a function of the orbital phase .",
    "we suspect that the fuv flux is possibly attenuated by absorption from the stream material ( originating at l1 ) overflowing the disk edge and reaching a height above ( and below ) the disk of the order of @xmath45 we further check this suggestion in section 3 .",
    "since the _ fuse _ flux varies as a function of the orbital phase it is interesting to compare it with other spectra obtained in quiescence ; this will also help us interpret results from previous spectral analysis .",
    "the existing archival _",
    "spectra of em cyg were taken during outburst , just a week before the acquisition of the quiescent _ fuse _ spectrum ( see figure 2 ) , and the three existing _ hut _ spectra were also taken in outburst . because of that we disregard the stis and hut spectra .",
    "however , some of the existing _ iue _ spectra were taken in quiescence , and later were modeled by @xcite .",
    "we present and discuss these spectra here .",
    "in figure 6 we compare three _ iue _ swp spectra taken in quiescence together with the _ fuse _ exposures in the spectral range @xmath46  . since _ fuse _",
    "exposures 2 and 3 have about the same flux , we combine them together , and the same for exposures 1 and 4 .",
    "we see that swp 08088 ( taken in 1980 ) has a much lower flux , similar to exposures 2 and 3 .",
    "swp 17591 ( taken in 1982 ) has a flux level comparable with exposures 1 and 4 , while swp 17592 ( taken 90min after swp 17591 ) has a higher flux level .",
    "the typical quiescent @xmath47 of the system is 13.5 but it has been observed as faint as 14.5 in quiescence ( possibly at eclipse @xcite ) . from validated aavso data , it appears that , at the time of the _ fuse _ observations , the system had a magnitude of @xmath48 ( figure 2 ) , namely em cyg was nt in its lowest possible quiescent state at the time of the _ fuse _ observations .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure 2 , where the previous quiescent state on jd2452505 is about 0.5mag fainter than the quiescent state during which the _ fuse _ observations ( jd2452522 ) were carried out .",
    "the iue swp 17591 and swp 17592 spectra were obtained during a brighter state , when em cyg was on the rise to outburst , its magnitude around 13.2 - 13.5 ( but still lower than a standstill with @xmath49 ) .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "swp 08088 spectrum was at @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the three _ iue _ swp spectra are complemented with three lwr spectra .",
    "all the quiescent ( lwr and swp ) _ iue _ spectra are listed in table 2 together with their corresponding orbital phase .",
    "the increase in flux between swp 17591 and swp 17592 over a time scale of 90min is most probably due to orbital variation ( as in _ fuse _ ) , and the matching lwr spectra 13862 and 13863 do not show any variation . as to the swp 08088 and ( matching ) lwr 07056 spectra , their lower flux is due to a deeper quiescence and to orbital variation too .",
    "because of these changes in flux level ( due to both orbital variation and intrinsic changes in the source ) combining the _ fuse _ and _ iue _ spectra together is tricky and this might explain the difficulty @xcite were having to match both the short wavelengths of _ fuse _ and the longer wavelengths of _ iue _ in the same fit . as a consequence we do not combine the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg with any _ iue _ spectrum .",
    "the shorter wavelength range as well as the higher s / n of _ fuse _ over _ iue _ makes the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg ideal for determining the temperature of the accreting wd .    from the _ fuse _ & _ iue _ spectra of em cyg",
    ", we found that the fuv flux between @xmath9900  and 2000   is attenuated around phase @xmath51 . since the _ fuse _ spectrum presents many deep absorption lines , it is tempting to suggest the possibility of an absorbing component moving in front of the observer around phase @xmath52 , as the binary rotates .",
    "we further investigate this possibility in the next section .",
    "the only components of the system that could be in the field of view of the wd / inner disk around @xmath51 are the region downstream the hot spot and the stream possibly overflowing disk at the hot spot . in order to check this possibility , in this section , we consider previous studies of the stream - disk interaction , and also present a simple ballistic trajectory simulation using the binary parameters of em cyg .",
    "we show that for the binary parameters of em cyg , stream material could be found high enough above the disk of the plane , around phase @xmath51 to actually veil the wd and inner disk .",
    "pioneering analytical studies by @xcite have shown how part of the stream material possibly flows over and under the disk and falls back onto the disk at smaller radii at an angle @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is measured counter clockwise from the line joining the two stars ) , corresponding to an orbital phase @xmath55 .",
    "observationally , doppler tomography @xcite has been used for a quarter of a century to confirm the stream disk interaction and the impact at smaller radii in some system ( e.g. z cha ) . in @xcite some of the stream matter was flowing over the disk at a scale height @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the binary separation . for a disk of diameter @xmath58 , this corresponds to a scale height of @xmath59 at the edge of the disk .",
    "namely , in these analytical studies , it was obtained that stream material overflows the disk rim ( at the hot spot ) and continue toward smaller radii while basically _ grazing _ the disk s surfaces ( at a few vertical scale lengths - a few @xmath60 ) .",
    "therefore , based on these studies alone , in order for the material to veil the wd , the inclination of the system has to be @xmath61 or larger : the system has to be nearly edge - on .",
    "however , more recent full 3d hydrodynamical simulations , e.g. @xcite , have followed in detail the interaction of the material streaming from the first lagrangian point ( l1 ) with the disk .",
    "the main result from these simulations is that the stream does not simply grazed the disk s surfaces , but matter is actually deflected vertically from the hot spot and flows in a more or less diffuse stream to inner parts of the disk , hitting the disk surface close to the _ circularization radius _ @xmath62 ( see @xcite for details on @xmath62 ) at orbital phase 0.5 . in these simulations ,",
    "the stream material deflected vertically at the hot spot region can reach an altitude @xmath63 .",
    "this stream deflection is believed to cause x - ray absorption in cvs ( and lmxbs ) around orbital phase 0.7 , if the inclination is at least @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "these simulations also explain streams of material perpendicular to the orbital plane as observed in algol - type binaries ( e.g. u crb ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these results imply that stream material can be deflected vertically , and reaches a height @xmath65 and lands onto the disk at @xmath66 ( corresponding to an orbital phase 0.5 ) @xcite .",
    "we suggest the same might be happening in em cyg , and the decreased flux around @xmath67 might be caused by the deflected stream flow . in order to verify the plausibility of this scenario",
    ", we simulate the stream flow from the l1 point using the ballistic trajectory approximation , and we deflect the ballistic particle at the hot spot by an angle @xmath68 ( measure from the plane of the disk ) .",
    "since the stream flow consists of a infinite number ( in the continuity limit ) of particles ( and since the stream has a finite thickness extending vertically ) , the ballistic trajectory is solved for all possible value of @xmath68 ( from @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) .",
    "a maximum altitude is reached for a critical angle of deflection @xmath71 .",
    "this maximum altitudes depends on the values of the system parameters : veiling will not occur for every mass ratio , disk radius and inclination ( the full details of the simulations as well as results for the entire space parameters of cvs are given elsewhere @xcite ) .",
    "figure 8 depicts such a simulation for em cyg , where we show with arrows the 4 _ fuse _ exposures .",
    "the mass ratio is 0.77 and @xmath58 .",
    "the stream is shown in red and the blue area represents that portion of the trajectory for which the material reaches @xmath72 , corresponding to veiling at @xmath73 . here",
    "the stream is deflected at the hot spot with an angle @xmath74 above ( and below ) the plane of the disk .",
    "this is the angle for which the altitude of the ballistic particle reaches a maximum . for a smaller , or _",
    ", deflection angle @xmath68 , the blue region shrinks . for a smaller disk radius ( @xmath75 ) the maximum elevation above the disk increases",
    ", however , the hot spot moves counterclockwise towards @xmath76 and as a consequence exposure ( 3 ) is not as veiled as for @xmath58 .",
    "this points to the importance of the large disk in em cyg for deflecting material off the disk plane around @xmath51 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the full 3d hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite . for different system parameters ( inclination",
    ", mass ratio and disk radius ) the deflected material does not especially veil the wd , as the maximum vertical elevation of the ballistic particle does not always reach @xmath77 .    from this specific ballistic trajectory simulation with the system parameters of em cyg",
    ", we conclude that the lower flux in the _ fuse _ exposures 2 and 3 can be accounted for with stream material being deflected vertically at the hot spot forming a veil in front of the wd between orbital phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( for an inclination of @xmath80 ) . the increase in flux between the _ iue _ spectra swp 17591 ( @xmath81 ) and swp 17592 ( @xmath82 ) over a time scale of 90min can also be explained by veiling of the wd / inner disk by the stream overflow around phase 0.75 ( keeping in mind that the wd / inner disk are not eclipsed around @xmath83 ) .",
    "furthermore , the stream material overflowing the disk edge lands onto the disk at a smaller radius corresponding to orbital phase of up to @xmath84 , and produces a bright spot there @xcite .",
    "together with the hot spot , this contributes to additional flux in the longer wavelengths ( lwr spectra ) .",
    "the emission from the hot spot and point of impact is possibly seen in the lwr spectra ( 13862 , 13863 ) shown in figure 7 as a plateau in the longer wavelengths ( @xmath85 ) , where one rather expects the flux to decrease there .",
    "this flux in the longer wavelengths was already associated with emission from the hot spot by @xcite .",
    "though we have no way to confirm that the plateau in the longer wavelengths of _ iue _ is due in part to the impact point of the stream overflow , it is , however , consistent with this possibility .",
    "the plateau seen in the lwr spectra , is also contributing significantly to the longer wavelengths of the swp spectra .",
    "this is especially true for the swp 08088 spectrum .",
    "these are additional reasons not to model the _ iue _ spectra , nor to combine them with the existing _ fuse _ spectrum , as the hot spot and point of impact contribute flux to the longer wavelengths of the _ iue _ swp spectra .",
    "we create model spectra for high - gravity stellar atmospheres using the codes tlusty and synspec @xcite .",
    "we generate photospheric models for a @xmath86 wd with effective temperatures ranging from 12,000k to 75,000k in increments of about 10 percent ( e.g. 1,000k for t@xmath8715,000k and 5,000k for t@xmath8770,000k ) .",
    "we vary the stellar rotational velocity @xmath88 from @xmath89km@xmath27s@xmath29 to @xmath90km@xmath27s@xmath29 in steps of @xmath91km@xmath27s@xmath29 .",
    "we also use disk models from the grid of models generated by @xcite .",
    "we select their models with a wd mass @xmath92 and inclinations @xmath93 & @xmath94 .",
    "these models have solar abundances , but because of the velocity broadening the absorption lines are completely smoothed out , such that the disk models ( @xmath95 ) are not sensitive to the chemical abundances .",
    "these disk models are either used as such or in combination with wd models we generate .    after having generated grids of models , we use fit @xcite , a @xmath96 minimization routine , to compute the reduced @xmath97 ( @xmath96 per number of degrees of freedom ) and scale factor values for each model fit . before carrying out each synthetic spectral fit of the spectrum , we masked portions of the spectrum with strong emission lines , and air glow .",
    "while we use a @xmath96 minimization technique , we do not blindly select the least @xmath96 models , but we also examine the models that best fit some of the features such as absorption lines .    the wd rotation ( @xmath88 ) rate is determined by fitting the wd model to the spectrum while paying careful attention to the line profiles",
    ". we did not carry out separate fits to individual lines but rather tried to fit the lines and continuum in the same fit .",
    "we first fit solar abundance models and only then we change the abundances of the species .",
    "we identify ism lines in figure 3 to avoid confusing them with the wd lines .",
    "the ism lines are deep and broad and we decided to model them , especially since some of the wd lines ( such as siv @xmath981062.6 & 1073 ) are located at almost the same wavelengths .",
    "we model the ism hydrogen absorption lines to assess the atomic and molecular column densities .",
    "this enables us to improve the wd spectral fit .",
    "the ism models ( transition tables ) are generated using a program developed by p.e .",
    "this program uses a custom spectral fitting package to estimate the temperature and density of the interstellar absorption lines of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "the ism model assumes that the temperature , bulk velocity , and turbulent velocity of the medium are the same for all atomic and molecular species , whereas the densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen , and the ratios of deuterium to hydrogen and metals ( including helium ) to hydrogen can be adjusted independently .",
    "the model uses atomic data of @xcite and molecular data of @xcite .",
    "the optical depth calculations of molecular hydrogen have been checked against those of @xcite .",
    "the ratios of metals to hydrogen and deuterium to hydrogen are fixed at 0 and @xmath99 , respectively , because of the low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the wings of the atomic lines are used to estimate the density of atomic hydrogen and the depth of the unsaturated molecular lines for molecular hydrogen .",
    "the temperature and turbulent velocity of the medium are primarily determined from the lines of molecular hydrogen when the ism temperatures are @xmath100k .",
    "the ism absorption features are best modeled and displayed when the theoretical ism model ( transmission values ) is combined with a synthetic spectrum for the object ( namely a wd synthetic spectrum or a wd+disk composite spectrum ) .",
    "though the distance estimate to em cyg is most like around 400pc @xcite , we do not fix the distance in our model fitting .",
    "we adopt a wd mass of @xmath31 @xcite in all our models , with a corresponding radius of @xmath101 km ( giving @xmath102 ) .",
    "all the model fits are carried out on the first exposure ( with the maximum flux ) .",
    "the reddening toward em cyg is @xmath103 . as a consequence , we model em cyg assuming both e(b - v)=0.0 and e(b - v)=0.05 .",
    "we first carry out the fitting without dereddening the spectrum , and only later do we deredden the spectrum ( assuming ( e(b - v)=0.05 ) to assess the effect of reddening on the results .",
    "we first run single disk models .",
    "we find that in order to fit the short wavelengths of _ fuse _ , the best single disk model has a mass accretion rate @xmath104yr@xmath29 , i.e. far larger than expected for quiescence , and @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath33 model is shown in figure 9 .",
    "it gives a distance of 441pc and @xmath105 ( all our @xmath96 values are smaller than one due to the low s / n of the _ fuse _ exposures ) . on top of the model , we add an ism model in order to optimize the fit .",
    "the ism has the following parameters @xmath106 atoms/@xmath107 , @xmath108 molecules/@xmath107 , t=160k , v=25km / s , @xmath109 , and z=0@xmath110 solar .",
    "we did not try to optimize the ism model itself , nor to obtain accurate parameter values for the ism .",
    "the modeling the ism is carried only in the context of improving the disk / wd model fit and to help identify the lines and spectral features .",
    "it is clear from figure 9 that this disk model only vaguely follows the continuum of the spectrum and does not fit the absorption features ( except for the ism lines ) .",
    "the two best single disk models are listed in table 3 .",
    "next , we run single wd models .",
    "we find that in order to fit the continuum the wd must have a temperature of 40,000k , with a corresponding distance of 280pc .",
    "the @xmath96 obtained is @xmath111 .",
    "the two first wd models in table 3 shows how the distance and @xmath96 change as a function of the wd temperature . in this first set we chose a guessed rotational velocity of 200km / s . in the next model ( table 3 )",
    ", we improve the @xmath96 value by varying the rotational velocity .",
    "the optimal value is somewhere between @xmath112 and @xmath5km / s , and we decide to fix the rotational velocity to 100km / s .    in the next four models ( table 3 )",
    "we change the abundances of silicon , sulphur and nitrogen while keeping all the other abundances to their solar value ( we found that a solar carbon abundance is the best fit , though the main carbon line at 1175   has also some broad emission and makes it difficult to model ) .",
    "the best fit is obtained for enhanced abundances as follows : sulphur : 10 times solar , nitrogen : 10 time solar and silicon : 20 - 30 times solar .",
    "we obtain a distance less than anticipated : @xmath9260pc .",
    "we present this best fit model in figure 10 . in order to optimize the fit we shift the synthetic wd spectrum to the blue by 0.5  , to account for the radial velocity shift .",
    "this improves slightly the @xmath96 values ( the values listed in table 3 reflect this improvement ) .",
    "we also add an ism model to the wd model , however , the ism model is not shifted .    in the next model in table 3",
    "we deredden the spectrum assuming e(b - v)=0.05 , and obtain the same results , except for the distance . here",
    "the distance is barely 200pc .",
    "we note that assuming a wd mass of @xmath113 can increase the distance to 350pc without changing the remaining parameters of the fit .",
    "on the other side , adding an accretion disk does increase the distance too , and this is what we do next .",
    "for the wd+disk composite model , we first take our best single wd model and add a disk model to it , to try and improve the fit and increase the distance .",
    "we find that the mass accretion rate has to be at least @xmath114yr@xmath29 for the disk to contribute a noticeable flux . as the disk",
    "is added , the model deteriorates and give a larger @xmath115 .",
    "we present such a model in figure 11 .",
    "the fit in the lower wavelength is not as good as the best fit single wd model presented in figure 10 .    in order to try and improve the fit in the shorter wavelength we increase the wd temperature , as the mass accretion rate is already too large for quiescence and",
    "therefore can not be increased .",
    "we find that the fit in the shorter wavelengths can be improved by elevating the wd to a temperature @xmath116k , however the overall @xmath115 is further increased by doing so .",
    "this model is shown in figure 12 .",
    "while the model does well at fitting the overall continuum of the spectrum , it does not fit the _ fuse _ absorption lines as the velocity broadening in the disk makes the overall depth of the line shallower in the wd+disk model .",
    "it is possible that the absorption lines form above the disk and wd ; we discuss this possibility and its implications in the next and last section .",
    "the over abundances and the unidentified lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg might be associated with some of the veiling material rather than the wd itself , we have no additional way to verify this .",
    "however , simulations of the stream disk interaction @xcite show that the stream overflow hits the disk at smaller radii where it can in part bounce back .",
    "if this is the case , stream material can be found at any orbital phase , but with greater density and altitude above the disk plane around @xmath51 .",
    "the rich variety of lines observed in the present _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg is reminiscent of the _ hst_/stis spectrum of the dn tt crt observed in a low state with an inclination of @xmath117 @xcite , and of the _ fuse _ spectrum of the nl bb dor possibly with an inclination of @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "these spectra suggest line formation in different temperature regions , whether due to a wind above the disk ( as could be the case in bb dor ) or overflowing stream material ( possibly for tt crt ) .",
    "so the strong and deep absorption lines in the _ fuse _ exposure 1 of em cyg are likely due to circumstellar material , i.e. stream material overflowing the disk rim and bouncing off the disk at smaller radii , while the lower flux in exposures 2 and 3 are due to the direct veiling of the wd by the stream overflow around phase 0.7 .",
    "if the veiling material is responsible for the absorption lines , then the abundance fitting is not valid anymore , as the lines might be out of thermodynamic equilibrium or represent highly variable optical depths . as a consequence ,",
    "the best fit to the continuum is actually the wd+disk model shown in figure 12 , rather than the single wd model .",
    "while the single wd model has a lower @xmath96 value , the wd+disk model is in better agreement with the distance of the system and its higher - than - quiescent state . because of this",
    ", we conclude that the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg is best interpreted as the spectrum of a hot wd with a small contribution from a low mass accretion disk .    the picture that emerges from this spectral analysis ,",
    "is that of a 50,000k wd , contributing 93% of the total fuv flux , and a disk , with @xmath114yr@xmath29 contributing the remaining 7% .",
    "such a composite wd+disk model gives a distance d=382pc in best agreement with its expected value .",
    "the wd+disk model is also in agreement with the moderately higher - than - quiescent state during which the _ fuse _ spectrum was taken , even though the @xmath96 value is slightly larger as the model does not fit the absorption lines very well .",
    "the spectrum presents some deep absorption lines as well as unidentified lines in the longer wavelength region ( @xmath119 ) , apparently forming in front and above the wd / disk , from stream material overflowing the disk edge . as a consequence ,",
    "the exposure taken at phase @xmath120 has a higher flux than exposures obtained around @xmath121 .",
    "the large disk ( @xmath122 ) in em cyg is consistent with this picture , as the hot spot is consequently located closer to the secondary ( around @xmath123 ) and l1 stream material can more easily be found off the disk plane .",
    "the large disk is also consistent with the non - negligible mass accretion rate ( @xmath124yr@xmath29 ) .",
    "however , whether modeled with a single wd component or a wd+disk composite model , the _ fuse _ spectrum of em cyg reveals a rather hot wd .",
    "this result is in strong disagreement with the previous spectral analysis of @xcite who found a wd temperature @xmath125k .",
    "the discrepancy with previous analysis is due to ( i ) veiling of the wd by stream material overflowing the disk rim ( in both the _ fuse _ and _ iue _ spectra around orbital phase @xmath51 , which were modeled as such ) ; ( ii ) contribution of the hot spot and secondary impact region to the longer wavelengths of the _ iue _ swp spectra ; and ( iii ) eclipse of the disk in the swp 08088 _ iue _ spectrum ( taken around orbital phase @xmath126 ) . in addition , in these previous analysis , the flux was contributed mostly from an accretion disk , while in the present work the main component is the wd .",
    "originally , the derivation of em cyg system parameters were affected by the presence of the third star , arkadash , in the background of the system .",
    "in a similar way , we find that the previously derived mass accretion rate and wd temperature might have been affected by the veiling of the wd and disk by stream overflow around orbital phase @xmath121 .",
    "pg wishes to thank steve ( stephen ) lubow for some interesting discussions on the stream disk interaction , and mario livio for his kind hospitality at the space telescope science institute , where part of this work was carried out .",
    "we wish to thank an anonymous referee for her / his very prompt report and constructive criticism .",
    "we are thankful to the members of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for providing public online optical archival data on em cyg .",
