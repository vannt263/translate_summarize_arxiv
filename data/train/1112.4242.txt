    "quantum chromodynamics predicts a new form of matter , a deconfined state of quarks and gluons called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it can be created by heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies experimentally  @xcite . in a collision ,",
    "particles are produced by two main processes : soft hadrons are generated from the hot dense medium created by energy sedimentation , while jets are produced from initial hard scatterings .",
    "being relevant to the two processes respectively , the discovery of the large elliptic anisotropy ( @xmath2 )  @xcite and the jet quenching  @xcite have been taken as important evidences of qgp at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "particles produced by different processes carry different information of the system .",
    "for example , the soft hadron azimuthal anisotropy at low transverse momentum , called elliptic flow , is formed due to the hydrodynamic pressure buildup in the initial almond overlap region of the colliding nuclei  @xcite . at large transverse momentum , energetic partons",
    "are predicted to lose energy by induced gluon radiation  @xcite .",
    "this energy loss depends strongly on the traversed path length of the propagating parton , thus also leads to azimuthal anisotropy @xmath2",
    "the @xmath2 measured from final state particles is the combination of these two effects .",
    "however , the elliptic flow @xmath2 and azimuthal anisotropy @xmath2 of jets individually might not be the same . trying to separate the two , previous work  @xcite in this regard",
    "has focused on the covariance of @xmath2 from forward and backward regions , which has been found later that the method is complicated by @xmath2 fluctuations  @xcite , and the jet contribution still can not be directly accessed from final state particles . in this paper , we approach the problem differently by studying the multiplicity correlation .",
    "the procedure is similar to the previous study  @xcite . to insure that jets only contribute to one region",
    "while collective particles contribute to both in a single event , two regions with the same size in phase space are chosen . since jets are produced locally , following ref .",
    "@xcite , we make forward - backward rapidity bins with a gap between them .",
    "the proposed new observable @xmath3 is defined as the standard correlation function : @xmath4 where @xmath5 refers to the particle yields in the forward ( backward ) region , and @xmath6 means taking the average over events .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ]   ( color online ) the dependence of forward - backward multiplicity correlation function @xmath3 on jet fraction @xmath7.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ]    to count the contribution of jets to the total multiplicity , we define a @xmath7-parameter : @xmath8 here @xmath9 refers to the multiplicity of flow ( jets ) .",
    "since the experimental efficiency does not bias flow or jet particles , forward or backward regions , it is not expected to affect the measurement .",
    "similar to  @xcite , in each event , the yields in forward ( backward ) region can be written as @xmath10 with @xmath11 in the above , @xmath12 is the total multiplicity in an event , and @xmath13 is the event - by - event multiplicity fluctuation of flow particles in each region .",
    "the jet multiplicity may also fluctuates event - by - event , thus no average is taken for @xmath14 . after taking the average over all events",
    ", we will get @xmath15 .",
    "for the final state particles , the correlation between flow particles and jets is believed to be small thus ignored , and this is justified by that they are produced at different moments during the collision , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 describes the jet contribution to the forward and backward region .",
    "since jets only fall in one side in an event , the assumed value is 1 or 0 .",
    "the location is randomly decided , so the probability is the same for each side , i.e.,@xmath18 while @xmath19=0 .",
    "combine eq .",
    "( [ gfun ] ) and ( [ nfun ] ) and insert into eq .",
    "( [ cfb ] ) , we find the relation for @xmath7-parameter and @xmath3 : @xmath20 @xmath7 is the contribution of jets and @xmath21 is a measure of correlated forward - backward fluctuations .",
    "both of them affects the behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the relation between @xmath3 and the @xmath7-parameter . in the ideal case , if flow particles from the two regions fluctuate independently , i.e. , @xmath22 , as assumed in ref  @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) can be simply written as @xmath23 then , @xmath7 can be extracted from the value of @xmath3 . if the system is hydro dominated , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "while if the system is jets dominated , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . on the other hand in a realistic case , if flow particles from the two regions do not fluctuate independently ( @xmath28 ) , when @xmath7 is small , @xmath3 will be larger than 0 , and when @xmath7 is large , the effect of @xmath21 can be ignored .",
    "( color online ) @xmath3 as a function of @xmath29 for flow - only simulation .",
    "the black dash curve is from eq .",
    "( [ c4]).,width=3 ]    the eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) works in the low @xmath29 with relatively large number statistic .",
    "however , if there is only one flow particle produced a particular @xmath29 bin in a event , it can only fall into one side and behaves like a jet . in that case",
    ", the multiplicity correlation function will automatically decrease when the particle yield is much smaller than 1 .",
    "this effect has not been discussed in previous studies  @xcite , and can be easily confused with the contribution from jet . to explore this effect ,",
    "a simulation was performed as followed .",
    "the flow particles were generated with a exponentially decreases distribution , and randomly fell into forward / backward region . adopting the consistent terminology as in  @xcite , we call them `` flow - only '' particles throughout this paper . the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] shows the result of flow - only simulation .",
    "it can be seen that although there is no jet , @xmath0 is still approaching to @xmath30 at large @xmath29 .",
    "this phenomena is solely due to , for a given @xmath29 bin , the exclusion of events for which both @xmath31 and @xmath32 for that @xmath29 bin are zero , from the @xmath33 calculation .",
    "this happens even when the two samples are completely independent of each other .    with the simplest assumption that when particle yield @xmath34 is smaller than 1 , maximum one particle can be found in either forward or backward region , the probability of finding an empty @xmath29 bin is @xmath35 .",
    "if one calculates @xmath36 without the exclusion of events with empty bins as mentioned above , for two independent samples it should be at unity .",
    "considering the exclusion , one needs to scale each averaging term in @xmath36 by a factor of @xmath37 , then @xmath38 can be written as : @xmath39 thus even for independent samples , with the exclusion of empty bins , @xmath38 is decreasing with increasing @xmath34 . the black dash line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is a plot of eq .",
    "( [ c4 ] ) .",
    "we can see that when @xmath29 is larger than 2.2 gev/@xmath40 , the equation can well describe the simulation result . while when @xmath29 is smaller than 2.2 gev/@xmath40 , the simulation result is lower than the black dash curve .",
    "this is because when particle yield is not so small , there might be more than one particle generated in the forward / backward region for the flow - only simulation .",
    "therefore , from the eq .",
    "( [ c3 ] ) and fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] we can conclude that both of the jets and the scarcity of particles can cause the decreasing trend of @xmath38 . we may also expect that it will decline even faster when jets are involved in the particle - rare case .",
    "the forward - backward multiplicity correlation function @xmath0 is studied in a multiphase transport model ( ampt )  @xcite .",
    "there are four main components in this transport model : the initial conditions , the parton - parton interactions , the conversion from the partonic to the hadronic matter and the late hadronic interactions .",
    "the initial conditions are based on the hijing model  @xcite in which the eikonized parton model is employed .",
    "it includes the spatial and momentum distributions of minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes .",
    "the parton - parton interactions and the time evolution of partons is then treated by the zhang s parton cascade ( zpc )  @xcite model .",
    "the hadronization process is described by a combined coalescence and string fragmentation model . a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite which includes baryon - baryon ,",
    "baryon - meson and meson - meson elastic and inelastic scattering is employed to describe the late hadronic process . in our study , we analyzed the events from string melting ampt model for au + au collisions at @xmath1 gev with parton cross sections equal to 10 mb .",
    "pseudorapidity regions @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] are chosen as forward and backward region respectively .",
    "( color online ) @xmath3 as a function of @xmath29 for au+au collision at @xmath43=200 gev in ampt string melting model .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we can see that @xmath3 almost stays as a constant when @xmath46 gev/@xmath40 . since particles from high energy jets give only a small contribution at those @xmath29 , the value of @xmath3 reflects the flow multiplicity fluctuation , @xmath47 .",
    "although the particle yield decreases exponentially , @xmath47 shows little @xmath29 dependence for this region . to obtain the jet contribution ,",
    "@xmath3 is fitted by the function : @xmath48 and @xmath49 is parameterized using a tanh function to describe threshold behavior between the two regimes , as suggested in  @xcite : @xmath50\\}/2 . \\label{fit}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 is not simply @xmath51 anymore .",
    "instead , it is a convolution of both @xmath51 ( dominated at low @xmath29 ) and the automatic decrease of @xmath33 ( dominated at large @xmath29 ) . after fitting ,",
    "we could obtain the first part of eq .",
    "( [ fit1 ] ) : @xmath52 where the effect of flow multiplicity correlation between the forward and backward regions has been canceled .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we present the fitting of ampt data by the red dash curve .",
    "we can see that this form can well describe the trend of the data , and we obtain that @xmath53 . for comparison",
    ", we fit the particle distribution with levy function , which can well describe the data , and generates flow particles with the same distribution . as discussed before , the flow particles will randomly fall into each side in this simulation .",
    "the result of this flow - only simulation is shown as the blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . from the plot",
    ", we can see that the simulation stays zero at low @xmath29 as expected since there is neither jet nor correlation . while at intermediate @xmath29 range , both of the ampt data and the flow - only simulation decreases as @xmath29 increasing .",
    "we found that the ampt result including jet contribution is only slightly lower than the flow - only simulation .",
    "therefore , we argue that the decreasing trend of the forward - backward correlation function as shown in  @xcite may not only due to the jet contribution , but mostly due to the artificial decrease for the particle - rare case .    to see the details clearly , the results from ampt model are divided by that from the flow - only simulation . here",
    "we define @xmath54 the deviation from unity of this ratio reflects the dilution of @xmath55 due to pairs containing jets . from the plot , we can see that the ratio begins to deviate from 1 around 2 gev/@xmath40 , which indicates that the jet contribution begins to join in this region .",
    "the difference between the points and the curve comes from flow multiplicity correlation .    for qualitatively study ,",
    "we assume that the square root of the ratio is proportional to the particle yield which is expected to work for @xmath56 gev/@xmath40 as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] , and finally @xmath7 can be extracted from @xmath57 .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) shows that the @xmath7-parameter is about 10% at 2 gev/@xmath40 and reaches 30% at 3 gev/@xmath40 .",
    "our method works best for central collisions in which away - side production of a jet is suppressed thus those particles can be considered as being `` melted '' into flow particles . while for the non - central collision , the @xmath7 quantity will be reduced due to the not quenched away - side jets . in that case , the correlation function measures the @xmath58 jets in one side .",
    "the forward - backward elliptic anisotropy correlation has been discussed in ref  @xcite .",
    "this correlation function also subjects to the small number statistic discussed before . here",
    "we redefine the elliptic correlation function : @xmath60 where @xmath61 refers to the sum of the @xmath2 of particles in forward ( backward ) region in each event .",
    "the @xmath62 we measured in experiments is constituted of two parts : flow @xmath63 and jet @xmath64 : @xmath65 @xmath66 describe the collective behavior of hydro , and @xmath64 is related to the parton energy loss in different directions .",
    "the relation between @xmath59 and pure jet ( flow ) @xmath2 can then be written as : @xmath67 the differences between this and ref  @xcite is coming from the @xmath30 in the definition .",
    "one should pay attention that @xmath21 here is not the same as in the multiplicity correlation . for multiplicity correlation",
    ", @xmath13 refers to the total multiplicity fluctuation in each side . while for @xmath2 correlation",
    ", @xmath13 have azimuthal dependence , i.e. , the in - plane and out - of - plane multiplicity fluctuation may cause the statistic fluctuation of @xmath2 . to be clearer , the eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) can be written as @xmath68    therefore , for the hydro dominate case , i.e. , @xmath24 , @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath59 describes the @xmath2 fluctuation at low @xmath29 , and the large value of the @xmath59 observed in ref  @xcite could be understood according to the magnitude of the flow fluctuation studied in ref  @xcite . for intermediate @xmath29 , however , the decreasing trend of @xmath59 observed  @xcite are mostly due to the rare flow particles as discussed before .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to check the behavior of @xmath59 in the lhc energy where particle yield is much higher .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a forward - backward multiplicity correlation function @xmath0 to study the jet contribution .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 is sensitive to the jet contribution , and its value will be enlarged by the forward - backward multiplicity correlation . in the intermediate @xmath29 , we find that the @xmath0 is sensitive to small number statistic and will automatically decrease even there are no jets involved .",
    "this effect should also be present in previous study of @xmath70 , and might be misunderstood as the contribution of jets .",
    "we study the @xmath0 in au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev with ampt string melting model .",
    "when @xmath29 is lower than 1.4 gev/@xmath40 , @xmath0 is independent of @xmath29 , and @xmath21 is about 0.01 . at intermediate @xmath29 range , @xmath0 decreases with @xmath29 , and the result from ampt model is lower than the flow - only simulation of the same yield .",
    "it indicates that both of the the jet contribution and the procedure of excluding events with empty bins will cause the decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "the estimated jet fraction is much smaller than previous study .    finally , we discussed the connection of our study to the forward - backward elliptic anisotropy correlation function .",
    "the large value of @xmath70 is found due to @xmath2 fluctuation , and the decrease of @xmath70 observed previously is caused by both of the jet and the tail of flow particle distribution , with the latter dominates .",
