    "the determination of the ages of pulsars is of crucial importance to neutron star astrophysics .",
    "neutron star population synthesis , birthrate , supernova remnant associations , and even cooling timescales ( which serve as probes of the neutron star equation of state ) , all depend on accurate determinations of pulsar ages . in general , a pulsar s age is estimated by assuming a spin - down evolution of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is known as the _ braking index_. it can be determined observationally by measuring @xmath6 , since , as is easily shown , @xmath7 . integrating equation  [ eq : spindown ] over the lifetime of the pulsar , assuming a constant braking index , results in the following estimate of the pulsar s age : @xmath8 , \\label{eq : age}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the spin period of the pulsar at birth .",
    "it is conventional to assume @xmath10 , appropriate for spin - down due to magnetic dipole radiation , and @xmath11 to derive the characteristic age @xmath12 .    timing noise , stochastic variations in the pulse spin - down ( see e.g. * ?",
    "* ) , make accurate determinations of the braking index impossible for the large majority of the over 1300 radio pulsars currently known .",
    "the five reliably measured radio pulsar braking indices are in the range @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this clearly signals a significant difference between pulsar electrodynamics and a simple dipole spinning down _ in vaccuo_. this is of major interest to modelers of pulsar magnetospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but it is also very important for neutron star astrophysics in general : if the braking indices of all pulsars are @xmath14 , then the characteristic age systematically underestimates the true age .    on the other hand , initial spin periods @xmath9",
    "that are a non - negligible fraction of the current spin period @xmath15 lead to a systematic over estimation of the true age .",
    "the distribution of initial spin periods is also of intrinsic scientific interest , since it gives clues to the physics of the formation of neutron stars as well as such possibilities as early epochs of rapid spin - down due to gravitational radiation or interactions with fossil disks .",
    "however , to infer the initial spin period from equation  [ eq : age ] requires an independent determination of the true age , such as an associated historical event or a well determined age from an associated supernova remnant .",
    "this situation is very rare .",
    "the best , and until recently only , example is the crab pulsar , whose measured braking index and known age results in an inferred @xmath16  ms .",
    "there are very few other historical supernovae that might be used .",
    "of course an isolated pulsar s current spin period is an upper limit on the initial spin period , so , for example , @xmath17  ms can be trivially inferred for psr  j0537@xmath186910 in the lmc @xcite .",
    "g11.20.3  is a young supernova remnant plausibly associated with the historical `` guest star '' witnessed by chinese astronomers in the year 386 a.d .",
    "@xcite . radio and x - ray estimates of its age @xcite , assuming a type ii supernova , support the historical association .",
    "a young 65-ms pulsar with spin - down energy @xmath19  erg  s@xmath20 was discovered in x - rays by _ asca _ within g11.2@xmath180.3 @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations place the pulsar at the precise center of the remnant @xcite , making the association of the two unambiguous . surprisingly , the @xmath21 , determined from one observation in 1994 and three observations in 1998 , implies a characteristic spin - down age of @xmath22  yr @xcite , 15 times that inferred from the historical association , the remnant radio surface brightness , and the remnant x - ray spectrum . for this large discrepancy to be resolved , either the braking index @xmath23 , or the initial spin period @xmath24  ms is very near the current spin period .",
    "very recently , a similar @xmath9 was inferred for the newly discovered pulsar in 3c58/sn1181 @xcite , suggesting that such long initial spin periods may be common .",
    "unfortunately , the number of systems where the initial spin period can be estimated is likely to remain small .",
    "therefore , it is crucial that all alternative explanations for the age discrepancy observed in g11.20.3   be fully explored .",
    "the results presented here were obtained using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) .",
    "our observations consist primarily of @xmath25  ks observations taken on a monthly basis .",
    "deep radio searches have been unable to detect the pulsar @xcite , and so x - ray monitoring of the source is the only option for timing .",
    "the spin - down rate @xmath26 of psr  j18111925   was first made by @xcite using _ asca _ , essentially on the basis of periods at just two widely spaced epochs .",
    "here we present a phase - coherent timing solution for the the pulsar using regular _ rxte _  observations .",
    ".spin parameters for psr  j18111925  derived from phase coherent timing of this source for @xmath27  months.[ta : spin ] [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to obtain a high signal - to - noise pulsed spectrum for psr  j18111925 , data from each observing epoch were folded at the expected pulse period as was done for the timing analysis .",
    "however , here , 8 phase bins were used across the pulse . for each phase bin",
    ", we maintained a spectral resolution of 128 bins over the pca range .",
    "one off - pulse phase bin was used as a background estimator .",
    "the pulse profiles were then phase aligned , so that the same off - pulse bin was used for background in every case .",
    "the remaining phase bins were summed , and their spectral bins regrouped into groups of 4 using the ` ftool ` ` grppha ` .",
    "energies below 2  kev and above 70  kev were ignored , leaving 23 spectral channels for fitting .",
    "the regrouped , phase - summed data set , along with the background measurement , were used as input to the x - ray spectral fitting software package ` xspec ` .",
    "response matrices were created using the ` ftool`s ` xtefilt ` and ` pcarsp ` .",
    "we fit the data using a simple photoelectrically absorbed power law , holding only @xmath28 fixed at the value found by @xcite ( see table  [ ta : spectra ] ) .",
    "uncertainties were measured using the ` xspec ` command ` steppar ` .",
    "the photon index @xmath29 we obtained is consistent within the uncertainties with the value ( @xmath30 ) found by @xcite using _ chandra _ observations .",

    "the ratio of the pulsed x - ray luminosity in the 210  kev band to @xmath31 gives an efficiency , @xmath32 assuming isotropic emission . comparing the efficiencies calculated by @xcite for the 41 known rotation - powered x - ray pulsars ,",
    "psr  j18111925  is the third most efficient , with psr  j18460258 @xcite being the first , and psr  b150958 @xcite the second .",
    "note that the efficiencies calculated by @xcite often included unpulsed contributions resulting from pulsar wind nebular emission , therefore their efficiencies can only be considered upper limits to the pulsed efficiencies .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarities among the three most x - ray efficient rotation - powered pulsars : ( i ) they all have long duty - cycles , with profiles that remain broad even to high energies ( @xmath33  kev ) ( ii ) they have very hard spectra with photon indices @xmath34 ( iii ) they are all very young ( @xmath35  yrs ) pulsars in the centers of supernova remnants ( iv ) they all have pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "furthermore , none of these pulsars have been detected in high energy @xmath36-rays ( @xmath37  mev ) .",
    "this is in contrast to pulsars such as the crab , vela , and psr  b170644 @xcite , which have very narrow x - ray pulse profiles , relatively low x - ray efficiencies , but are all detected in high energy @xmath36-rays .",
    "the spectrum and pulse morphology can give us a clue to the emission mechanism at work in psr  j18111925 .",
    "high - energy emission mechanism models generally fall into two classes : polar cap models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and outer gap models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two harder components of the four component x - ray profile ( in the _ rxte _  band ) of the vela pulsar , which are as hard or harder that psr  j18111925 are due to particle curvature emission according to the polar cap model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these two components are very narrow and phase aligned with the double peaked @xmath36-ray pulse . for psr  j18111925 , the broad profile and the absence of @xmath36-ray pulsations make a similar mechanism unlikely . in the outer gap model ,",
    "the broad , hard profile of psr  j18111925  would be from the tail of the synchrotron component . according to @xcite , the peak of the synchrotron spectrum for psr  j18111925  would occur at @xmath38  mev ,",
    "this could be verified with @xmath36-ray observatories such as _ glast _ and _",
