    "the recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very robust evidence that neutrinos are massive and their flavor mixing involves two large angles ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and one small angle ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these important results indicate that the minimal standard electroweak model , in which neutrinos are massless weyl particles , is incomplete",
    ". a very economical extension of the standard model , the so - called minimal seesaw model @xcite , is to introduce two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) but preserve its @xmath16 gauge symmetry . in this case , the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath19 is the higgs - boson weak isodoublet ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 stand respectively for the right - handed charged - lepton and majorana neutrino singlets . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , we obtain the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath23 and the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the vacuum expectation value of @xmath19 . because @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath26 singlets , their mass scale is not subject to the electroweak symmetry breaking and can be much higher than @xmath27",
    ". then the seesaw mechanism @xcite works for the effective ( light and left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath28 ; i.e. , @xmath29 holds as a very good approximation .",
    "the smallness of left - handed neutrino masses @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) is therefore ascribed to the largeness of right - handed neutrino masses @xmath32 ( for @xmath33 ) , while the bi - large neutrino mixing pattern is attributed to a significant mismatch between the diagonalizations of @xmath34 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath35 allows the lepton - number - violating decays of @xmath36 ( for @xmath33 ) to happen : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "since each decay mode can occur at both tree and one - loop levels , the interference of two decay amplitudes leads to a cp - violating asymmetry @xmath39 between @xmath40 and its cp - conjugated process @xmath41 . if the expansion of the universe gives rise to the out - of - equilibrium decays of @xmath14 and ( or ) @xmath15 @xcite , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( or one of them ) may result in a net lepton number asymmetry .",
    "the latter can partially be converted into a net baryon number asymmetry via the nonperturbative sphaleron interaction @xcite .",
    "such an elegant baryogenesis - via - leptogenesis mechanism @xcite provides a viable interpretation of the cosmological baryon number asymmetry , @xmath44 , which has recently been extracted from the three - year wmap observational data @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward test of the seesaw and leptogenesis mechanisms is to discover the heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos and measure the strength of their interactions with other known particles , for instance , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite in the near or foreseeable future .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath36 can not be produced at lhc unless its mass scale @xmath32 is of @xmath0 tev up to @xmath45 tev , far below the typical seesaw scale @xmath46 gev @xcite .",
    "if @xmath47 tev is taken , for example , a successful leptogenesis to account for the observed value of @xmath9 requires that the splitting between @xmath48 and @xmath49 be extremely small @xcite .",
    "this interesting scenario , usually referred to as the resonant leptogenesis mechanism , may also get clear of the gravitino overproduction problem in those supersymmetric extensions of the standard model with heavy majorana neutrinos of @xmath50 .",
    "but @xmath51 ev and @xmath47 tev in the seesaw relation imply that the corresponding yukawa couplings must be of @xmath52 or smaller , rendering the production and detection of @xmath36 rather dim at lhc and ilc @xcite .",
    "for this reason , here we shall follow a less ambitious strategy by leaving out the observability of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos and concentrating on the phenomenology of neutrino mixing and resonant leptogenesis .",
    "the goal of this paper is to simultaneously explain the observed neutrino mixing pattern and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry .",
    "we are going to propose a particularly economical and suggestive seesaw model with two highly degenerate right - handed majorana neutrinos of @xmath0 tev .",
    "the novel yukawa - coupling texture of our model leads to the normal neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath53 and a nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern with the maximal cp - violating phase : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath54 . on the other hand",
    ", one may get the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath55 and the corresponding neutrino mixing pattern with @xmath2 and @xmath56 .",
    "we find that it is possible to establish a straightforward link between cp violation in the decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos and that in the oscillations of light left - handed majorana neutrinos in the @xmath57 case . as for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry ,",
    "we show that the observed value of @xmath9 can naturally be interpreted through the resonant leptogenesis mechanism in both @xmath53 and @xmath55 cases .",
    "we point out that the formula of @xmath39 given in ref .",
    "@xcite and that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to the same numerical result in the model under discussion , if the parameter space coincides with the perturbation condition .",
    "more interestingly , we demonstrate the significance of flavor - dependent effects in our resonant leptogenesis scenario : they can either flip the sign of the flavor - independent prediction for @xmath9 in the @xmath58 case or magnify the magnitude of the flavor - independent prediction for @xmath9 about @xmath10 times in the @xmath59 case .",
    "a salient feature of the minimal seesaw model is that it automatically predicts @xmath1 or @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath60 dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath61 can be parameterized as @xmath62 with @xmath1 @xcite or as @xmath63 with @xmath5 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are @xmath66 and @xmath67 unitary matrices , respectively . without loss of generality",
    ", we adopt the flavor basis in which both the charged - lepton mass matrix @xmath34 and the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath68 are diagonal , real and positive .",
    "then the seesaw relation @xmath69 implies that the flavor mixing of light majorana neutrinos depends primarily on @xmath64 and the decays of heavy majorana neutrinos rely mainly on @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenological observation motivates us to take @xmath64 to be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern @xcite @xmath70 which is compatible very well with the best fit of current experimental data on neutrino oscillations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the unitary matrix @xmath65 can be parameterized as @xmath71 since @xmath72 is the only phase parameter in our model , it should be responsible both for the cp violation in neutrino oscillations and for the cp violation in @xmath36 decays . in order to implement the idea of resonant leptogenesis",
    ", we assume that two heavy majorana neutrino masses are highly degenerate ; i.e. , the magnitude of @xmath73 is strongly suppressed .",
    "indeed @xmath74 or smaller has typically been anticipated in some seesaw models with three right - handed majorana neutrinos @xcite to gain the successful resonant leptogenesis .    given @xmath75 , the explicit form of @xmath28",
    "can reliably be formulated from the seesaw relation @xmath29 by neglecting the tiny mass splitting between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in such a good approximation , we obtain @xmath76 \\ ; %      ( 5a ) \\eqno{\\rm ( 5a)}\\ ] ] for @xmath1 ; or @xmath77 \\ ; %      ( 5b ) \\eqno{\\rm ( 5b)}\\ ] ] for @xmath5 , where @xmath78 is defined .",

    "@xcite to diagonalize the effective neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( 5a ) or ( 5b ) . for simplicity",
    ", here we fix @xmath79 and highlight the role of @xmath72 in neutrino mixing and leptogenesis .",

    ", we should take @xmath273 in the @xmath257 case . since negative @xmath72 leads to negative @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( 7a ) , the sign of @xmath274 in eq .",
    "( 8a ) will flip . but this modification does not change the results of neutrino masses and flavor mixing angles obtained in eqs .",
    "( 6a ) and ( 8a ) .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a very simple but suggestive seesaw model with two highly degenerate right - handed majorana neutrinos of @xmath0 tev .",
    "its novel yukawa - coupling texture leads to the normal neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath53 and a nearly tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing pattern with the maximal cp - violating phase : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath275 . on the other hand",
    ", it is possible to get the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath55 and the corresponding neutrino mixing pattern with @xmath2 and @xmath56 . a straightforward link between cp violation in the decays of heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos and that in the oscillations of light left - handed majorana neutrinos can be established in the @xmath53 case .",
    "we have successfully interpreted the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry @xmath276 through the flavor - dependent resonant leptogenesis mechanism in both @xmath53 and @xmath55 cases . in particular , we have shown that flavor effects can either flip the sign of the flavor - independent prediction for @xmath9 in the @xmath58 case or magnify the magnitude of the flavor - independent prediction for @xmath9 about 50 times in the @xmath5 case .",
    "* we have made three assumptions in building the model .",
    "taking @xmath64 to be the tri - bimaximal mixing pattern is purely a phenomenological assumption @xcite , so is taking @xmath65 to be the maximal mixing pattern with a cp - violating phase . both of them might be able to result from certain flavor symmetries ( e.g. , discrete @xmath277 and @xmath278 symmetries @xcite ) .",
    "the third assumption is the near degeneracy between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , or equivalently the smallness of @xmath207 .",
    "it seems a bit contrived to take such tiny values of @xmath207 , as shown in fig . 1 , to achieve the successful baryogenesis via leptogenesis .",
    "why is @xmath207 so small ?",
    "a few authors @xcite have conjectured that @xmath48 and @xmath49 might be exactly degenerate at an energy scale higher than the seesaw scale ( e.g. , the gut scale ) and their small splitting at the seesaw scale is attributed to the radiative corrections .",
    "* the minimal seesaw model with two heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be regarded as a limiting version of the conventional seesaw model with three right - handed majorana neutrinos @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath279 , in which @xmath279 is so heavy that it decouples from the theory at the very early stage . in order to gain the special mass spectrum ( i.e. , @xmath280 )",
    ", one possibility is to make use of the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism and assign the charges of three right - handed majorana neutrinos as @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "such a scenario allows @xmath14 and @xmath15 to be of @xmath0 tev and @xmath279 to be close to the gut scale , and it can also accommodate the yukawa couplings of @xmath284 .",
    "besides flavor symmetries , the supersymmetry breaking may do the same job , as shown in ref .",
    "radiative corrections to the light neutrino masses , the mixing angles and the cp - violating phases should also be taken into account , when those parameters run from the seesaw scale down to the electroweak scale .",
    "a generic analysis of the renormalization - group running effects in the minimal seesaw model has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite . because @xmath285 tev is specified in our model , however ,",
    "all of such running effects are expected to be negligibly small . even in the supersymmetric case with large @xmath286",
    ", significant radiative corrections can not emerge between the energy scales of @xmath0 tev and the electroweak scale . *",
    "we stress that this tev - scale neutrino mass model is also viable in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "in particular , the above calculation of @xmath9 can simply be extended to accommodate supersymmetry .",
    "the size of @xmath39 in the supersymmetric case is twice as large as in the standard model , so is the magnitude of @xmath287 @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath287 gives rise to the same order suppression of the @xmath288 dilution coefficient in eq .",
    "( 13 ) or eq .",
    "( 25 ) , hence the estimate of @xmath9 is not significantly changed by the introduction of supersymmetry .",
    "this observation , which has been confirmed by our detailed analysis , implies that the numerical results shown in fig . 1 are expected to be roughly ( order - of - magnitude ) valid for the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the upcoming neutrino oscillation experiments will test the predictions of our model for the neutrino mass spectrum , flavor mixing angles and cp violation .",
    "a more intriguing test of such seesaw - plus - leptogenesis models is certainly the direct search for tev - scale right - handed majorana neutrinos , are strongly model - dependent .",
    "for example , they inevitably rely on the mixing strength between @xmath36 and three charged leptons . the latter has been constrained to some extent by current experimental data on the lepton universality and lepton - flavor - violating processes .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions . ] which can be done at lhc and ilc in the future .",
    "due to the tiny yukawa couplings restricted by the models themselves , however , the observability of such new particles will be a big experimental challenge .",
