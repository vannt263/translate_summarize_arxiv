    "there has been burgeoning interest in the calculation of the excited spectrum of nucleons , spurred by the experimental programmes at jefferson laboratory and elsewhere . coinciding with this experimental interest",
    ", there has been a flurry of activity in the lattice community .",
    "two calculations of the mass of the parity partner of the nucleon have appeared ; the first employed the highly - improved @xmath2 fermion action@xcite , whilst the second employed domain - wall fermions@xcite .",
    "both calculations exhibited a clear splitting between the masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states , and the latter calculation stressed the importance of chiral symmetry in obtaining a non - zero mass splitting . in this talk , i will present a calculation of the masses of the lowest lying negative - parity baryons obtained using the non - perturbatively improved clover fermion action .",
    "there are three local interpolating operators employed for a positive - parity nucleon at rest : @xmath5 the `` diquark '' part of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 couples upper spinor components , whilst that in @xmath8 involves lower components and vanishes in the non - relativistic limit . in practice ,",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 have a much greater overlap with the nucleon ground state than @xmath8 , and are used in spectroscopy calculations to obtain the nucleon mass .",
    "the operators of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : n1])-([eq : n3 ] ) are appropriate for positive - parity states ; interpolating operators for negative - parity states are constructed by simply multiplying by @xmath9 .",
    "correlators constructed from these operators receive contributions from states of both parities .",
    "the best delineation that can be achieved is that of forward - propagating positive - parity states and backward - propagating negative - parity states , or the converse , through the use of the parity projection operator @xmath10 . on a lattice anti - periodic in time ,",
    "the correlator may be written @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temporal extent of the lattice . at large distances , when @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the correlators behave as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the lightest positive- and negative - parity masses respectively . in the presence of unbroken chiral symmetry",
    ", the positive- and negative - parity baryons would form mass - degenerate doublets .",
    "the mass splitting between them is a manifestation of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "a local interpolating operator for the lowest - lying spin states of the @xmath18 @xmath19 baryon is @xmath20 this has an overlap onto both spin-@xmath21 and spin-@xmath22 states , but these can be distinguished using a suitable projection , and the positive- and negative - parity states delineated as described above .",
    "the calculation is performed using the gauge configurations and propagators generated by the ukqcd collaboration .",
    "two values of the coupling , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are employed , and propagators are computed using the clover fermion action , with the clover coefficient determined non - perturbatively thus removing all @xmath1 discretisation errors .",
    "the quark propagators are computed from both local and fuzzed sources to local and fuzzed sinks .",
    "the parameters of the calculation are summarised in table  [ tab : params ] , and further details are contained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are obtained from a simultaneous , four - parameter fit to the correlators @xmath25 and @xmath26 of equation  ( [ eq : corrs ] ) , using fuzzed sources and local sinks .",
    "the quality of the data and of the fits for both the positive- and negative - parity states is illustrated in figure  [ fig : effmass ] , and the importance of including the backward - propagating positive - parity state in the determination of the negative - parity mass is clear .",
    "the masses in the chiral limit are obtained by linear extrapolation in the quark mass , as shown in figure  [ fig : chiral_extrap ] for the data at @xmath24 .",
    "the results show a clear splitting between the masses of the positive- and negative - parity states persisting to the chiral limit .",
    "also shown as the burst is the experimental determination of the lowest lying @xmath27 mass , @xmath28 , scaled with the lattice spacing determined from the nucleon mass ; the agreement between the lattice determination of the @xmath4 mass and the experimental value is striking .",
    "the quality of the extracted masses is poorer at @xmath23 than at @xmath24 , reflecting the larger value of the masses in lattice units . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the `` bad '' baryon operator @xmath8 yields a much higher mass for the positive - parity ground state , comparable with that of the negative - parity baryon obtained using @xmath6 .    with only two values of the lattice spacing , it is not possible to perform a continuum extrapolation .",
    "however some indication of the magnitude of discretisation effects can be gleaned from figure  [ fig : continuum ] , where the masses of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are shown in units of sommer s @xmath29 at each of the two lattice spacings .",
    "the higher spin states are expected to be larger , and thus more susceptible to finite - volume corrections .",
    "a analysis including data at three values of the lattice spacing and at different lattice volumes is in progress@xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath30 is also accessible , though subject to greater statistical noise . here",
    "the mass is obtained from a simultaneous single - mass fit to the fuzzed - local and local - local correlators in which the contribution of the opposite - parity state is neglected , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : delta_effmass ] . a clear splitting is seen between the masses of the positive- and negative - parity states , shown in figure  [ fig : delta ] .",
    "this calculation using the non - perturbatively improved clover fermion action is capable of resolving the mass splitting between positive- and negative - parity baryon states , and yields a value consistent with experiment . under the @xmath31 symmetry of spin - flavour and orbital angular momentum ,",
    "the low - lying negative parity baryons are assigned to the @xmath32-plet representation .",
    "calculations of the masses of these states both in the quark model@xcite , and in large @xmath33@xcite , suggest that the spin - orbit contribution is surprisingly small , whilst the hyperfine contribution is crucial .",
    "the introduction of the clover term to the wilson fermion action improves the prediction for hyperfine splittings ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and this may account for earlier failures to present measurements of the negative - parity masses using the wilson fermion action . a comparison of results using the two actions will be included in a later paper@xcite .",
    "the determination of the masses of spin states above @xmath21 requires the use of non - local baryon operators .",
    "indeed , baryon spins above @xmath34 are contaminated by lower spins in the same irreducible representations of the cubic group@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the _ ab initio _ determination of the masses of the first few spin / parities of the @xmath0 system seems feasible , with the promise of invaluable information about the nature of qcd and hadronic physics .",
