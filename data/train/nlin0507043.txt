    "the one - dimensional free particle and the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator are arguably the two simplest quantum mechanical systems that exist . nonetheless , and in spite of the intrinsic simplicity of such systems when treated in isolation ,",
    "the problem of an essentially free particle interacting locally with one or more oscillators is difficult and important to a large class of physical systems .",
    "it arises in a variety of contexts , ranging from fundamental studies aimed at understanding the emergence of dissipation in hamiltonian systems @xcite , to electron - phonon interactions in solids @xcite , and , more recently , to basic issues associated with the phenomena of quantum decoherence . in the condensed matter literature , in particular , a great deal of theoretical work has focused on the nature of electron - phonon interactions , and the rich variety of behavior that occurs , such as the emergence of `` polaronic '' quasi - particles . in one version of the well - known holstein molecular crystal model , a tight - binding electron in a crystal moves between different unit cells , in each of which it interacts with a local oscillator @xcite . even in the simplest `` spin - boson '' form of this problem , in which the particle can be conceived as moving between just two sites , and",
    "in which it interacts with a single collective oscillator , the problem is not exactly soluble , and has been the subject of intense investigations regarding the appropriateness of various semi - classical approximations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the situation can be just as complex in completely classical versions of the problem .",
    "we study here the surprisingly rich classical dynamics of what is perhaps the simplest hamiltonian model that one can think of that incorporates the essential features of this local free particle - oscillator interaction @xcite . specifically , we consider a single classical particle of mass @xmath0 position @xmath1 and momentum @xmath2 that moves on a ring , the circumference of which is divided into two sections . on one section",
    "the particle moves freely , on the other it interacts with a single oscillator of mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the associated hamiltonian we write in the form@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the oscillator momentum , and @xmath7 describes the strength of the interaction , which is linear in the oscillator coordinate @xmath8 , but not in the particle position @xmath9 . in the hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) , @xmath10 is a form factor localized around @xmath11 that describes the range of the interaction .",
    "we take @xmath12 to equal unity throughout the interaction region @xmath13 , and to vanish on the section of the ring @xmath14 lying outside this range . with this choice , except at those moments of the evolution when the particle arrives at @xmath15 ,",
    "the particle and the oscillator are effectively uncoupled , and evolve independently . at `` impacts '' ,",
    "i.e. , when the particle arrives at the edges of the interaction region , the particle receives an impulsive kick from the oscillator that conserves the total energy of the system . after each such kick",
    ", the particle again moves as a free particle either inside or outside of the interaction region .",
    "it is this essentially uncoupled evolution of the two subsystems between impulsive kicks of the particle at @xmath15 that makes it possible to numerically and analytically track the dynamics .     and @xmath16 , and varying values of the energy @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as shown ( see sec .",

    "eseries(b ) ) .",
    "this then makes for the simplest possible mixed phase space structure , in which motions in the completely integrable region and in the chaotic region are clearly separated and independent of one another .",
    "we are unaware of other hamiltonian systems which exhibit this clean separation , although it does appear in a piecewise linear symplectic map on the torus that was explicitly constructed to exhibit this property @xcite .    as a second striking feature of the model , we identify one - parameter families of marginally unstable periodic orbits , that appear as circular arcs in the oscillator phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ arcfig ] ) , and are similar to the so - called bouncing ball orbits that arise in the stadium billiard .",
    "we furthermore show that for fixed , suitably - chosen system parameters , the statistical properties of the dynamics on the different energy surfaces can vary greatly .",
    "for some values of the energy , the dynamics is completely integrable , whereas for others it is fully chaotic or displays a mixed , kam - type behavior . among the rich variety of structures that arise , we identify and locate the central fixed point of a kam - type elliptic island that we refer to as void ii . in some cases",

    "the presence of chaos in our coupled particle - oscillator model can be understood intuitively as follows .",
    "a trajectory of the combined system will tend to be unstable whenever the time the particle takes between two impacts at @xmath15 is long compared to the oscillator period .",
    "indeed , when the particle goes slowly , a small change in its velocity at one impact will lead to a large change in the relatively fast moving oscillator coordinate at the next impact . as a result ,",
    "the height of the potential barrier the particle meets at that moment becomes highly unpredictable , and this is the source of the instability . that this simple picture is in agreement with observed behavior can be seen in fig .",

    "similarly , increasing @xmath28 tends to increase the chaotic fraction of phase space outside of void i , since for larger @xmath31 the particle spends more time between succesive visits at @xmath15 whenever it is outside the interaction region .",

    "the system described by the hamiltonian @xmath35 as given in ( [ h1 ] ) depends upon six system parameters : the two masses @xmath36 and @xmath37 the oscillator frequency @xmath38 and the coupling strength @xmath39 as well as the widths @xmath40 and @xmath28 of the interacting and non - interacting sections of the ring on which the particle moves . to reduce the number of inessential parameters in the system , we now introduce a dimensionless time @xmath41 and dimensionless variables and momenta@xmath42 where @xmath43 is an arbitrary constant having units of action that plays no part in the subsequent dynamics .",

    "the particle s momentum undergoes discontinuous changes at these moments , but its position remains a continuous function of time .",
    "the impulse imparted to the particle at @xmath72 is readily computed from the oscillator displacement using only conservation of total energy .",

    ". obviously this way of depicting the evolution can be repeated indefinitely , and provides an efficient way to analyze and explain various features of the dynamics .",
    "for example , the description given in the last section makes it clear that the mechanism underlying the appearance of chaos in this system is the existence of the two non - aligned shears @xmath143 and @xmath125 .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon .",
    "for example , on a torus @xmath145 $ ] , successive application of the two shears@xmath146 yields a hyperbolic map@xmath147 and leads to chaotic dynamics if @xmath148 locally , the two shears @xmath143 and @xmath125 have exactly this structure , but in polar coordinates and with the role of @xmath149 and @xmath150 played by @xmath151 and @xmath152",
    ". the divergence of @xmath153 at the edges of the disks thus provides a clear mechanism for the emergence of chaos in certain regions of phase space .",

    "furthermore , for such a @xmath215periodic orbit to be possible , the phase points must somehow arrange to miss the intersection with @xmath158 as they advance around @xmath163 in angular steps of @xmath216 clearly , for this to happen , the angle @xmath217 subtended by the two intersection points of the edge of the disk @xmath158 and the circle of radius @xmath197 on which the phase point moves must be smaller than the angular separation between neighboring orbit points , i.e. , @xmath218 for fixed points @xmath219 , this condition on the angle @xmath220 is automatically satisfied , but for periodic orbits with @xmath221 the condition imposes a bound on @xmath197 that prevents , e.g. , periodic orbits of this type occuring too close to the edge of @xmath194    these arguments show that , in general , fixed points of the dynamics will occur at the radii@xmath222 for which @xmath223 note that this infinite sequence of values @xmath224 accumulates at @xmath225 i.e. , at the edge of @xmath194 it follows that any phase point in @xmath226 with @xmath227 will be a fixed point of the dynamics .",
    "the set of such points for a given value of @xmath214 is an arc in the phase plane . in fig .",
    "[ arcfig ] , such an arc of fixed points with @xmath228 appears near the edge of void i.    now suppose for some value of @xmath229 and @xmath197 we have @xmath230 and @xmath231 in this situation there will exist @xmath213 arcs of angular span @xmath232 centered at @xmath164 each point of which is associated with a period @xmath213 orbit .",
    "several arcs associated with higher order orbits of this type also appear in fig .",
    "[ arcfig ] , and can occasionally be seen in some of our other phase plots .",
    "if the phase points were recorded at @xmath140 then each arc that appeared in such a diagram would , by the arguments given above , lie outside of the intersection region with @xmath156 , which is at the bottom of each phase diagram in this paper .",
    "however , because the phase points in these figures are recorded at @xmath82 when @xmath81 is positive , the angular position of each arc is rotated by an odd multiple of @xmath233 from where it would be if recorded at @xmath234 this is due to the rotation of the oscillator phase point that occurs while the particle travels from the edge of the interaction region back to the center , where the phase point is recorded .",
    "since this rotation is a function of the radius @xmath197 , arcs of this kind can generally appear at any orientation in the phase diagram .    on general arguments",
    "it is to be expected that periodic trajectories of this kind are parabolic .",
    "indeed , the stability matrix associated with a phase point lying on such an arc has a vanishing lyapunov exponent along the direction tangent to the arc itself , since neighboring points along the arc are periodic orbits of the same order .",
    "on the other hand , in any neighborhood of such a point there will be initial conditions at radii @xmath235 just above or below the arc that will not satisfy ( [ arcs ] ) for any values of @xmath214 and @xmath213 .",
    "such points will give rise to trajectories in which the particle eventually does pass outside the interaction region , to end up at the mercy of the alternating shears @xmath143 and @xmath125 , which give rise to the chaotic portions of the phase diagram .",
    "thus , in general , we expect arcs of periodic trajectories of this type to be largely immersed in the chaotic parts of the phase diagram .    from the discussion above , which focuses on motions confined to the interaction region , one may wonder whether there are counterparts to these motions which take place with the particle confined entirely outside the interaction zone .",
    "in fact , it is easy to convince oneself that such motions are relatively few and far between . indeed , for any point @xmath236 in @xmath237 , the circle on which it moves necessarily intersects @xmath194 moreover",
    ", the angle @xmath238 subtended by the two intersection points of the edge of the disk @xmath156 and the circle of radius @xmath239 on which the phase point moves is now greater than @xmath240 .",
    "hence , only period one orbits are able to avoid entering the interaction region .",
    "such fixed points will occur whenever the time the particle takes to traverse the non - interaction region is an integer multiple of the oscillator period .",
    "having thus classified all orbits in which the particle never leaves the interaction region , we now turn to the more complicated situation in which the particle explores the entire configuration space available to it . of course",
    ", it is impossible to classify all such orbits , since they are precisely the ones that are responsible for the variety of intricate structures that appear , as well as for the chaos .",
    "nonetheless , some of the more prominent features of our figures can be explained quantitatively .",
    "indeed , we show in the analysis below that the fixed point at the centers of the elliptic islands that we have referred to as void ii arise from a relatively simple type of orbit in which the particle traverses each section of the ring _",
    "exactly once per period_. we also show that an infinite number of such fixed points exists , and that most of them are hyperbolic , and thus unstable .",
    "conceptually , such an orbit can be viewed within the geometric picture developed above , as follows .",
    "consider a phase point @xmath236 on the @xmath241-axis within @xmath156 at an instant when the particle is at the center of the interaction region and is moving to the right ( see fig .",
    "[ voidii](a ) ) .",
    "when the particle reaches @xmath242 the oscillator phase point has rotated through an angle @xmath243 about the center of @xmath155 to the point @xmath244 as shown .",
    "the particle now leaves the interaction region and travels around the ring to @xmath131 while the oscillator phase point rotates through an angle @xmath245 to a point @xmath246 . for the particle to",
    "now re - enter the interaction region , the point @xmath247 must lie in the intersection region @xmath157 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ voidii](b ) .",
    "thus , all periodic orbits that traverse each section of the ring exactly once per period have vertices @xmath129 and @xmath247 that lie on a `` lozenge '' structure of this type . using relatively simple arguments , given below , we can locate the tops of all such lozenge orbits and demonstrate in the process that they are infinite in number .     and @xmath158 , of lozenge orbits associated with fixed points of the dynamics .",

    "it should now be clear that the intersection points of these two curves locate all possible values @xmath129 associated with periodic orbits of this type . for each @xmath129",
    "so located , the corresponding fixed point @xmath236 is obtained by rotating @xmath129 through @xmath258 . since these two curves intersect an infinite number of times , the number of such fixed points is , itself , infinite .",
    "indeed , the points @xmath259 and @xmath260 at the intersections of the edges of @xmath156 and @xmath158 are accumulation points of lozenge tips .",

    "let us now show how to predict in advance whether any particular intersection of @xmath256 and @xmath252 gives rise to a stable or unstable fixed point . to this end , it is clearly sufficient to consider the stability of the evolution in the neighborhood of the upper lozenge tip .",

    "having thus made our point that the most prominent features that appear in our phase plots can be explained in terms of the simplest periodic orbits of the system , we point out that many other periodic orbits occur in which the particle traverses the two sections of the ring more than once per period .",
    "such orbits will then give rise to the more complicated structures appearing , e.g. in fig .",
    "[ pigface ] .",
    "we conjecture that a more complete analysis of those orbits along lines similar to those developed in this paper , would allow a complete explanation of some of the more anthropomorphic structures appearing in that figure .",
    "the model we have introduced and studied in this paper clearly has certain similarities to a number of previously studied dynamical systems , such as the kicked rotor , the fermi accelerator , billiards , and the spring - pendulum .",
    "indeed , the study of the dynamics reduces in all these cases to the study of a return map on a suitably chosen poincar section .",
    "the model presented here nevertheless differs in important ways from each of these previously studied systems .",
    "indeed , the kicked rotor and the fermi accelerator describe externally perturbed nonconservative systems with one degree of freedom , while the current model is closed , energy - conserving , and has two degrees of freedom . in our model , although the particle gets `` kicked '' each time it reaches @xmath336 , the kicks are neither periodic in time , as in the rotor , nor are they imposed by an external agent , as is the case for both the rotor and the fermi accelerator .",
    "billiards , of course , are closed conservative systems with two degrees of freedom as well , but trajectories in billiards have the unusual property of being independent of particle energy , so that changing the energy does not change the statistical features of the dynamics .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the behavior of the present model , in which many of the interesting features that arise , do so as a result of changes in the energy of the system under conditions in which the underlying potential is kept fixed .",
    "moreover , the present system can be interpreted in terms of the hamiltonian interaction between two otherwise separate mechanical systems .",
    "it should , therefore , be of more use in understanding many problems for which that is an essential feature .",
    "another closed hamiltonian system of that type is the spring - pendulum broer1,broer2 . like the current model ,",
    "the spring - pendulum is a hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom , each of which has a simple description when treated on its own . unlike the spring - pendulum",
    ", however , the present model has the advantage that the coupling between the two sub - systems can be smoothly turned off in a way that allows the unperturbed dynamics of each to be recovered , and thus may be more useful for understanding fundamental properties of interacting independent systems of this type .",
    "we note that a bifurcation analysis for the spring - pendulum was given in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis applied to our model would yield predictions on the motion and the shape of the elliptic islands that appear in our model as the parameters are changed , and could be an interesting direction for future study .",
    "our emphasis here has instead been on some unusual features of our model , that we now briefly recall .",
    "we have argued that for suitable system parameters the system exhibits either a fully chaotic phase space , or a mixed phase space in which only two regions occur . in one",
    "the motion is chaotic , and in the other it is completely integrable with no secondary kam structures ( see fig .",
    "eseries(b ) and ( c ) ) . while we have explained the presence of chaos in the model in terms of alternating shears similar to the kind that arise in linked twist maps , our conjecture regarding the absence of secondary structures of finite measure in the chaotic sea for small energies",
    "is based largely on numerical calculations over very small regions of phase space that have heretofore failed to detect any structure in the chaotic region .",
    "we have not , however , given a rigorous proof that such structures do not emerge at small enough length scales in phase space .",
    "we note also that the sharp boundary that exists in this model between the chaotic and the completely integrable parts of phase space should make it an interesting system on which to test current conjectures of quantum chaos theory , in particular those pertaining to systems with a mixed phase space , and to the localization properties of eigenfunctions on chaotic and completely integrable parts of phase space . while the clear - cut boundary of the present model should facilitate such an analysis , @xcite it does have the complication of an underlying potential that has finite discontinuities in configuration space , and the matching problems that occur , in contrast , e.g. , to billiard systems , for which a number of efficient numerical techniques have been developed for solving the corresponding schrdinger equation @xcite .    our own interest in the present system arose originally from a fundamental interest in hamiltonian models of transport and dissipation in deformable media . in many such systems , the medium through which a particular transport species moves can be modeled as an appropriate collection of harmonic oscillators . among the many questions that arise in such extended systems",
    "is , e.g. , to what extent the presence of microscopic chaos , or its absence , in the interaction of a particle with a single oscillator , manifests itself in the transport properties that emerge at long times after repeated interactions with many independent or mutually - coupled oscillators .",
    "we view the present analysis as a step towards answering this and other questions related to systems of this kind .",

    "<S> we study the closed hamiltonian dynamics of a free particle moving on a ring , over one section of which it interacts linearly with a single harmonic oscillator . on the basis of numerical and analytical evidence </S>",
    "<S> , we conjecture that at small positive energies the phase space of our model is completely chaotic except for a single region of complete integrability with a smooth sharp boundary showing no kam - type structures of any kind . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the cleanest mixed phase space structure possible , in which motions in the integrable region and in the chaotic region are clearly separated and independent of one another . for certain system parameters , </S>",
    "<S> this mixed phase space structure can be tuned to make either of the two components disappear , leaving a completely integrable or completely chaotic phase space . for other values of the system parameters , </S>",
    "<S> additional structures appear , such as kam - like elliptic islands , and one parameter families of parabolic periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic sea . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are analogous to bouncing ball orbits seen in the stadium billiard . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical part of our study proceeds from a geometric description of the dynamics , and shows it to be equivalent to a linked twist map on the union of two intersecting disks . </S>"
