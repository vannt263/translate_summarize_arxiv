    "the main reason for choosing the chiral @xmath29 current instead of the @xmath30 current which has been used in the calculation of the @xmath31 form factor @xcite , is because twist3 wave functions do not contribute for this choice , which are the main inputs of the light cone qcd sum rules and which bring about the main uncertainty to the results @xcite .",
    "following the general idea qcd sum rules to obtain the penguin form factor is by matching the representation of the correlator function in hadronic and quark  gluon languages .",
    "let us first consider the hadronic representation of the correlator function . by inserting a complete set of states with the same quantum numbers of the b meson between the currents in the correlator , and singling out the pole term of the lowest pseudoscalar b meson , we get [ e5403 ] _",

    "the upper limit of @xmath64 is determined by the condition that the higher states and continuum contributions are less than , for example , @xmath65 of the total result .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that both conditions are satisfied in the region @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , it should be emphasized that light cone qcd sum rule predictions are reliable in the region of momentum transfer square , i.e. , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a typical hadronic scale having the value @xmath69 , which yields @xmath70 .    in fig .",

    "as we have noted earlier , the prediction by the light cone qcd sum rule is not reliable in the region @xmath83 . in order to extend the present result to whole physical region , we look for some convenient parametrization of the form factor in such a way that in the region @xmath84 this parametrization coincides with the light cone qcd sum rule prediction .",
    "the best parametrization of @xmath76 with respect to @xmath78 can be written in terms of three parameters in the following way [ e5418 ] f_t^(q^2)=  .",
    "for the values of these parameters for the penguin form factor we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where the quoted errors can be attributed to the variation in @xmath35 and @xmath64 .",
