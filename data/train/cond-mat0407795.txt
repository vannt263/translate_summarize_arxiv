    "the hydrodynamic description of a low density gas of elastic hard spheres supported by an underlying kinetic theory attracted a lot of attention already more than 40 years ago  @xcite .",
    "it has now become a well established description  @xcite .",
    "a key ingredient in the hydrodynamic approach is the existence of collisional invariants ( quantities conserved by the instantaneous collisions ) .",
    "the question of the relevance of a coarse - grained hydrodynamic approach is therefore more problematic when the kinetic energy is no longer a collisional invariant @xcite .",
    "this is the case of rapid granular flows ( that may be modeled by inelastic hard spheres in a first approach ) , where the hydrodynamic picture , despite including a hydrodynamic field associated with the kinetic energy density , is nevertheless reliable ( see , e.g. , @xcite and dufty for a review @xcite ) .",
    "it seems natural to test hydrodynamic - like approaches further and in more extreme conditions , and investigate a system where particles react so that there exist _ no collisional invariants_. the present article , focusing on the derivation of the hydrodynamic description for such a system , is a first step in this direction .",
    "the system we consider is made of an assembly of hard spheres that move ballistically between collisions .",
    "whenever two particles meet , they either annihilate with probability @xmath1 , or undergo an elastic collision with probability @xmath3 .",
    "the model of probabilistic ballistic annihilation in one dimension for bimodal discrete initial velocity distributions was introduced in  @xcite , whereas for higher dimensions and arbitrary continuous initial velocity distributions it was considered in  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath4 , we recover the annihilation model originally defined by elskens and frisch  @xcite , that has attracted some attention since @xcite . in one dimension",
    "( again for @xmath4 ) , the problem is well understood for discrete initial velocity distributions  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "higher dimensions introduce complications that make the problem much more difficult to treat  @xcite .",
    "only a few specific initial velocity conditions lead to systems that are tractable using the standard tools of kinetic theory  @xcite",
    ".    our starting point will be the boltzmann equation , which describes correctly the low density limit of granular gases ( see @xcite and @xcite for the elastic case ) . for annihilation dynamics",
    ", the ratio of particle diameter to mean free path vanishes in the long - time limit , such that for @xmath5 the boltzmann equation is valid at least at late times  @xcite .",
    "for such a dynamics , none of the standard hydrodynamic fields ( i.e. , mass , momentum , and energy ) is associated with a conserved quantity .",
    "there are therefore three nonzero decay rates , one for each field .",
    "numerical evidences show that in the long - time limit , a non - maxwellian scaling solution for the homogeneous system appears ( homogeneous cooling state ( hcs )  @xcite , which also exists for inelastic hard spheres @xcite ) .",
    "nothing is known about the stability of the latter solution , the only existing result being that in one dimension , with a bimodal initial velocity distribution , clusters of particles are spontaneously formed by the dynamics  @xcite . in view of this situation",
    "we develop a hydrodynamic description for probabilistic ballistic annihilation . the limiting case of vanishing annihilation probability @xmath6",
    "gives the known results for elastic dilute gases  @xcite , whereas the other limit @xmath7 yields the case of pure annihilation .    in order to derive the hydrodynamic equations , we make use of the chapman - enskog method . we thus consider ( at least ) two distinct timescales in the system",
    ". the microscopic timescale is characterized by the average collision time and the corresponding length scale defined by the mean free path .",
    "the macroscopic timescale is characterized by the typical time of evolution of the hydrodynamic fields and their inhomogeneities .",
    "the fact that those two timescales are very different implies that on the microscopic timescale the hydrodynamic fields vary only slightly",
    ". therefore they are on such length- and timescales only very weakly inhomogeneous .",
    "combined with the existence of a normal solution for the velocity distribution function ( i.e. , a solution such that all time dependence may be expressed through the hydrodynamic fields ) , this allows for a series expansion in orders of the gradients , i.e. , application of the chapman - enskog method .",
    "the knowledge of the hydrodynamic equations thus obtained to first order allows us to perform a stability analysis . taking the hcs as a reference state ,",
    "we study the corresponding small spatial deviations of the hydrodynamic fields .",

    "[ section2 ] we present the boltzmann equation for probabilistic ballistic annihilation , and establish the subsequent balance equations .",
    "[ section3 ] is devoted to the chapman - enskog solution of the balance equations . for this purpose",
    "we consider an expansion of the latter equations in a small formal parameter .",
    "the solution to zeroth order provides the hydrodynamic fields of the hcs . assuming small spatial inhomogeneities , we make use of an explicit normal solution for the velocity distribution function to first order .",
    "this allows us to establish the expression for the transport coefficients and for the decay rates to first order , and thus the closed set of equations for the hydrodynamic fields .",

    ", we conclude that the system may exhibit transient instabilities , but safe statements may only be made for very low values of @xmath1 for which @xmath164 is low enough to guarantee that the hydrodynamic analysis holds .",

    "[ fig1 ] . ]",
    "in this paper we construct a hydrodynamic description for probabilistic ballistic annihilation in arbitrary dimension @xmath0 , where none of the hydrodynamic fields can be associated with a conserved quantity .",
    "the motivation is not only to discuss the possibility of large scale instabilities in such a system , but also to provide the starting point for further ( numerical ) studies centered on the applicability of hydrodynamics to systems in which there are no collisional invariants . to this aim",
    ", we consider the low density and long - time regimes in order to make use of the boltzmann equation with the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) as a reference state .",
    "the chapman - enskog method then allows us to build a systematic expansion in the gradients of the fields , with an associated timescale hierarchy .",
    "we consider only the first ( navier - stokes ) order in the gradients to build the hydrodynamic equations describing the dynamics of probabilistic ballistic annihilation .",
    "the transport coefficients and decay rates are established from the microscopic approach neglecting burnett contributions and restricting ourselves to the first non - gaussian term in a sonine expansion .",
    "we then linearize the hydrodynamic equations around the hcs .",
    "the subsequent dispersion relations inform on the range of the perturbation s wavelength and time scales for which the system may exhibit density inhomogeneities .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of the dispersion relations and of the wave numbers @xmath164 and @xmath167 is qualitatively similar to its counterpart obtained for ( inelastic ) granular gases  @xcite .",
    "this leads us to conclude that some features of those models do not depend on the details of the dynamics , but rather on the parameter controlling the dissipation ( referring to the existence of non conserved quantities ) in the system , namely , @xmath1 [ or @xmath194 in the case of granular gases , where @xmath195 is the restitution coefficient ] .",
    "however , a specific feature of our model is that the mean free path increases rapidly with time .",
    "consequently , even if the stability analysis leads us to the conclusion that this feature drives the system in a region where the homogeneous solution with a vanishing flow field is stable , the associated knudsen numbers may be too large to validate our coarse - grained approach . at very small values of @xmath1 , however , the stable region ( @xmath192 with the notations of sec .",
    "[ section4 ] ) should be relevant , but then , the effects of transient instabilities in the case where the system is large enough to allow for @xmath196 or @xmath197 seem difficult to assess .",
    "another point to emphasize is the amplitude of the dissipation in the system , which appears through the decay rates of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "again , there must be a clear separation between the macroscopic time scales described by those decay rates , and between the microscopic time scales .",
    "this separation of scales is required in the hydrodynamic approach in order to make use of the hydrodynamic fields @xmath73 , @xmath198 , and @xmath75 that are associated with nonconserved quantities . the decay rates having the dimension of the inverse of a time , their inverse thus defines a time scale .",
    "if those decay rates increase , the associated time scales decay . in our case",
    ", we clearly introduce three such time scales that are supposed to be macroscopic ; one for each nonconserved field .",
    "it is therefore required that the maximum of these decay rates defines a macroscopic time scale that is much bigger than the microscopic one .",
    "nevertheless those decay rates increase as a function of the annihilation probability and hence the decrease of the associated time scale .",
    "one question that arises is to determine for which value of @xmath1 the smallest time scale introduced by the decay rates is of the order of the microscopic time scale  which increases as a function of time because of the decreasing density of particles remaining in the system .",
    "when this is the case , the hydrodynamic description becomes irrelevant and one may not make use of the fields @xmath73 , @xmath199 , and @xmath75 any more . as the parameter @xmath1 controls the dissipation in the system , the question at hand here left for future work is reminiscent of the controversial issue of the validity of hydrodynamics for granular gases with `` low '' coefficients of restitution .",
