    "many properties of metals depend crucially on the type and concentration of defects that perturb the ideal crystal structure . of these ,",
    "the simplest are point defects , such as self - interstitials and vacancies . since their formation energies are of order electron volts , their equilibrium concentrations tend to be very low .",
    "they do form in abundance , however , in radiation environments due to the collisions between the irradiating species ( electrons , heavy ions or neutrons ) and the atoms of the host crystal @xcite . when the energy of the impinging particle is close to , but above , the displacement threshold , the collision typically produces a single frenkel pair .",
    "particles with higher kinetic energy , for instance neutrons produced in fusion reactions , create collision cascades which can produce not only frenkel pairs , but an ensemble of mobile and immobile self - interstitial and vacancy clusters of different sizes .",
    "the ensuing evolution of the point defect distributions due to diffusion @xcite determines the long time scale degradation of the mechanical properties of the material , in addition to volume swelling at large doses .    for body centered cubic ( bcc ) metals , such as @xmath1-fe , v and mo",

    "the lowest energy self - interstitial configuration is a @xmath4-oriented dumbell , which migrates easily with a crowdion transition state @xcite .",
    "however , this easy migration , with barriers as low as @xmath5 ev @xcite , leads to long one - dimensional self - interstitial diffusional trajectories .",
    "the self - interstitial dumbbell can change direction by rotating into other @xmath6-directions .",
    "the barrier associated with such rotations @xmath7 is of the same order as @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .    in @xmath1-fe , by contrast , the ground state of the dumbbell self - interstitial is the @xmath9 configuration , and accessing the easy - glide @xmath4 configuration requires overcoming a qualitatively similar rotational barrier that separates the @xmath9 from the @xmath4 configurations @xcite .",
    "although the migration barriers for the crowdion mechanism in @xmath1-fe are also believed to be very small @xmath10 ev ) , the observed effective migration barrier ( including rotation into the @xmath4 orientation and migration along the @xmath11-direction ) are higher than in v @xcite .",
    "similar arguments apply to mo and ta .",
    "both diffusion mechanisms imply that interstitial transport in bcc metals takes place in the form of long one - dimensional trajectories with occasional directional changes that become more frequent as the temperature increases . in fcc metals such as cu ,",
    "for instance , simulations showed that self - interstitial diffusion occurs through much more conventional , isotropic diffusion mechanisms @xcite . in most metals ,",
    "however , large separations in time scale between self - interstitial and vacancy motion exist .",
    "the intent of the present study is to illuminate the consequences of the intriguing microscopic diffusion mechanisms in bcc metals on the evolution of the point defect population using simple , but readily generalizable models .",
    "our models shall minimally include local self - interstitial / vacancy mutual annihilation and absorption into ( unsaturable ) sinks which , in a real system , are in the forms of dislocations or grain boundaries . together with the continuous production of point defects , these processes form the fundamental events in metals under irradiation conditions .    on the continuum level , point defect dynamics can be described by a set of kinetic master or rate equations that treat the point defects as a continuous density whose temporal evolution is governed by various gain and loss processes .",
    "these equations do not take into account spatial correlations and are only analytically tractable in the simplest situations .",
    "although we focus the discussion specifically on bcc metals , the continuum theory makes no reference to the underlying crystal structure and could be readily applied to fcc metals as well . in many cases , single interstitials and vacancies",
    "combine with defects of the same type to form stable clusters .",
    "the evolution of the cluster size distribution and other microscopic variables is more conveniently studied in a particle based model that explicitly represents defects and their diffusion mechanisms ( translation , rotation ) on a lattice .",
    "the competition of events occuring with different rates can then be followed using a kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) scheme .    both master equation and monte carlo approaches",
    "have frequently been employed to illuminate the physics of damage evolution in irradiated materials .",
    "starting from the elementary processes mentioned above @xcite , steady - state rate equations have been used to study the effects of preferential absorption of self - interstitial atoms at sinks ( absorption bias ) @xcite , the formation of interstitial cluster during the cascade phase ( production bias ) @xcite , and the one - dimensional motion of these clusters in bcc metals @xcite .",
    "kmc models were first used to evolve the primary damage state obtained from ns - long md simulations to macroscopic time scales , but have increasingly been used to study the evolution of defect structure during continuous irradiation in copper @xcite , vanadium @xcite and iron @xcite .",
    "although many treatments have included a high level of atomistic detail from the start , we begin by analyzing the simplest situation that includes only production of frenkel pairs , point defect recombination and absorption at sinks in section [ simple - sec ] .",
    "even though this simplified case has been studied many times before @xcite , we shall see that the inclusion of specific features of bcc metals leads to a surprisingly rich evolutionary picture .",
    "this approach allows us to gradually increase the level of complexity of the model in a verifiable , controlled manner .",
    "we introduce first interactions between vacancies that lead to vacancy cluster formation in section [ vaccluster - sec ] and then interactions between interstitials in section [ intclust - sec ] .",
    "in particular , we shall discuss how interstitial cluster mobility affects vacancy cluster formation .",
    "while the discussion in the text is applicable to bcc metals broadly , we apply our findings to the specific cases of v and @xmath1-fe in section [ real - sec ] .",
    "the physics of radiation damage evolution is governed by the production of defects due to irradiation and their subsequent elimination from the population through diffusional processes .",

    "the defects can undergo two basic reactions : recombination once an interstitial and vacancy defect are within a certain `` recombination volume '' , or absorption at sinks .",
    "typical dislocation densities in metals are of the order @xmath33 , which translates into dislocation sink densities ( per lattice site ) of @xmath34 .",
    "since the relevant time scales ( ns - sec ) for the evolution of the point defect distributions far exceed those of molecular dynamics simulations , we employ a coarse grained description , in which we represent vacancies , dumbbell interstitial configurations and sinks as pointlike objects that occupy ideal lattice sites of a bcc lattice with lattice parameter @xmath35 . in order to mimic constant irradiation conditions , new pairs of defects ( self - interstitial and vacancy )",
    "are introduced randomly onto defect - free lattice sites with rate @xmath36 .",
    "the microscopic diffusion process is replaced by instantaneous hops of point defects to vacant neighboring lattice sites with rates @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "a self - interstitial is constrained to forward - backward hops along one of the four @xmath17 directions , but can also rotate to another @xmath18 direction with rate @xmath27 .",
    "vacancies diffuse isotropically . a self - interstitial or vacancy recombines if it finds itself next to a vacancy or self - interstitial , respectively , or is absorbed if one of its 8 neighboring sites contains a sink . at each time step ,",
    "an event is chosen according to its probability and then executed .",
    "time is advanced according to the usual continuous time algorithm @xcite , where the time increment is chosen from an exponential distribution .",
    "the elementary processes described in the kmc model can , alternatively , be described within a rate equation formalism . before the advent of large scale computer simulations , this method represented the only viable theoretical approach for simulating long time radiation damage evolution .",
    "the rate equations can be solved by direct numerical integration or direct analysis in limiting cases . in the minimal model",
    "discussed above , the time evolution of the number densities of the interstitals @xmath39 and vacancies @xmath40 is given by the coupled nonlinear equations @xcite @xmath41 defect pairs are added to the population at a rate proportional to the particle flux @xmath15 and a cross - section @xmath16 .",
    "loss can occur through a diffusing interstitial recombining with a vacancy with rate @xmath42 and a diffusing vacancy recombining with an interstitial with rate @xmath43 .",
    "the recombination rates are all proportional to the diffusion constant of the moving defect , but depend on the dimensionality of the diffusion process . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are dimensionless capture numbers that represent the spatial extent of the defects and their effective ( possibly long ranged ) interactions .",
    "losses can also occur through absorption at sinks with rates @xmath46 and @xmath47 and corresponding capture numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 for interstitials and vacancies , respectively .",

    "( [ rate - eq ] ) is to define sink strengths @xmath50 via the relation @xmath51 , where the subscript @xmath52 refers to any of the combination of indices used above .",

    "@xmath58 , the typical collision time @xmath59 is given by the condition @xmath60 ( 3d ) and @xmath61 ( 1d ) , from which we deduce the encounter rates @xmath62 in a similar manner , the capture numbers @xmath63 are also affected by the dimensionality of the random walk .",
    "assuming ideal spherical defects of linear dimension @xmath64 , @xmath65 for a 3d random walk in a mean - field approximation @xcite , but in general , capture numbers can also depend on spatial fluctuations and dose .",
    "for a 1d random walk , the scaling with defect size becomes much stronger @xcite , @xmath66 .",
    "these expressions apply to strictly 1d or 3d random walks .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we encounter an intermediate case in bcc metals , where rotations interrupt 1d random walks and lead to 3d trajectories . the encounter rate of this random walk must , therefore , be larger than the purely 1d case . for a rotation rate @xmath27 , the random walker performs on average",
    "@xmath67 hops along a particular direction before rotating into a new direction .",
    "there are @xmath68 of these segments during time @xmath69 .",
    "the mixed 1d/3d collision time thus follows from the condition @xmath70 , which implies @xmath71 the mixed encounter rate @xmath72 scales like the 3d encounter rate @xmath73 , but is reduced by the square root of the ratio of the number of rotations to hops .",
    "this reaction rate has also been derived in ref .  .",
    "this work views the kinetics in the intermediate 1d/3d regime as an enhanced 1d reaction rate , but the resulting expressions agree up to numerical prefactors .",
    "these authors also showed that the size dependence of the mixed capture number @xmath74 , and ref .",
    "provides an interpolation formula between the limiting cases using a continuum description .",
    "while the encounter rates and reaction kinetics of random walkers decrease when the dimensionality of the random walk changes from three to one , the diffusivity does not , since the mean squared displacement of a random walk of @xmath57 steps of length @xmath54 is @xmath75 independent of dimensionality .",
    "note that these encounter rates are derived under the assumption of collisions with a stationary target .",
    "the case of several colliding 1d random walkers becomes equivalent to a 3d random walk because , from the rest frame of a given walker , the other walkers appear to be executing a 3d random walk .",
    "this case would be relevant for describing the collisions of interstitials with each other , but not with the vacancies or sinks .    inserting these encounter rates into eqs .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) , assuming mixed 1d/3d encounter for diffusing interstitials , yields rate eqations of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a dimensionless ratio that describes the relative frequency of dumbbell rotations and diffusional hops .",
    "we now specialize these results to the common case of bcc metals , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . before performing the kmc simulations and solving the full rate equations numerically , it is instructive to analyse the limiting behaviors of this system @xcite .",
    "inititally , there are no defects in the metal , and only the first term in the rate equations is important . in this regime ( regime i ) , defect densities increase linearly with time , @xmath80    once a sufficient density of defects has been produced such that the encounter times between defects becomes smaller than the time between creation events , loss through recombination ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 terms ) becomes important @xcite .",
    "as we shall see below , typical parameter ranges lead to a situation in which defect recombination becomes important before sink loss .",

    "note that this scaling regime is bound from above by the following condition : if @xmath88 becomes so large that the time between interstitial - vacancy encounters is on average shorter than the time between two subsequent rotations ( i.e. , if @xmath89 ) , the scaling of the encounter time becomes that of a 1d random walk . in this case , the scaling of the steady state defect density with @xmath90 changes from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this regime is unlikely to be of experimental relevance .",
    "eventually , loss through sinks becomes important and the steady state regime ii ends .",
    "clearly , there exists a terminal steady state ( see below ) in which all loss terms in eqs .",
    "( [ rate - eq ] ) balance the creation of defects . if @xmath93 as in the bcc metal case , however , the system will initially loose mostly interstitials and very few vacancies .",

    "since we have used @xmath129 in the rate equations , this agreement also validates the scaling argument for the mixed 1d/3d encounter rate . for the two smallest @xmath90-values , we observe increasing discrepancies between rate equations and kmc . as discussed above",

    "this happens because as the defect densities decrease below the sink density , point defect loss at sinks will become dominant before recombination plays a significant role . since the crossover time @xmath131 only depends on the point defect production rate , a further decrease of the production rate will eventually lead to a direct crossover from regime i to regime iv .",
