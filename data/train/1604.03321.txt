    "quantum entanglement is an intriguing property of composite systems .",
    "the generation of entangled states for two or more particles is not only fundamental for demonstrating quantum nonlocality @xcite , but also useful in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite , typically the bell state , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state and the w state @xcite .",
    "different entangled state has different advantages .",
    "for example , the w state is likely to retain bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out , thus it is robust against qubit loss .",
    "the ghz state is the most entangled state and can maximally violate the bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "recently , some attention has been paid to a special type of entangled state called the @xmath0-particle ( @xmath1 ) @xmath0-level singlet state @xcite .",
    "the form of the @xmath0-atom singlet state can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the generalized levi - civita symbols , @xmath4 are the permutations , and @xmath5 denote the bases of the qubits @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the singlet state not only is in connection with violations of bell inequalities @xcite , but also can be used to construct decoherence - free subspace , which is robust against collective decoherence @xcite . moreover",
    ", the singlet state can be used to solve several problems which have no classical solutions , including `` @xmath0 strangers '' , `` secret sharing '' , `` liar detection '' , and so on @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the singlet state also can be used in a scheme designed to probe a quantum gate that can realize an unknown unitary transformation @xcite . in recent years , lots of theoretical schemes",
    "have been proposed to generate singlet state in the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( c - qed ) system via different techniques @xcite . among these techniques @xcite",
    ", there are two famous techniques for their robustness against decoherence in proper conditions .",
    "one is stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite , the other is quantum zeno dynamics ( qzd ) @xcite . in general ,",
    "adiabatic passage technique has been widely used and an advantage of the technique is that can reduce populations of the intermediate excited states .",
    "therefore , the technique would restrain the influence of atomic spontaneous emission on the fidelity .",
    "as we know , the adiabatic condition is managed to be slow to make sure each of the eigenstates of the system evolves along itself all the time without transition to other ones .",
    "so , the operation time is long in previous schemes @xcite via adiabatic passage .",
    "differ from the adiabatic passage , qzd is usually robust against photon leakage but sensitive to atomic spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , some of the researchers introduce detuning between the atomic transition to restrain the influence of atomic spontaneous emission",
    ". however , that also increases the operation time . in general",
    ", the interaction time for a method is the shorter the better .",
    "otherwise , the method may be useless because the dissipation caused by decoherence , noise , and losses on the target state increases with the increasing of the interaction time @xcite .    in order to solve this problem , in recent years",
    "researchers pay more attention to `` shortcuts to adiabatic passage ( stap ) '' @xcite which employs a set of techniques to speed up a slow quantum adiabatic process through a non - adiabatic route .",
    "usually stap can overcome the harmful effect caused by decoherence , noise and losses during the long operation time .",
    "recently , stap has been applied in a wide range of system to implement quantum information processing ( qip ) in theory and experiment @xcite . in order to construct stap to speed up adiabatic processes effectively ,",
    "many methods @xcite are related .",
    "such as , invariant - based inverse engineering proposed by muga and chen @xcite , can achieve the fast population transfer within two internal states of a single @xmath6-type atom . `` transitionless quantum driving '' ( tqd ) @xcite proposed by berry , provides a very effective method to construct the `` counter - diabatic driving '' ( cdd ) hamiltonian @xmath7 which can accurately derive the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath8 to speed up adiabatic processes effectively .",
    "but it is also found that the designed cdd hamiltonian is hard to be directly implemented in practice , especially in multiparticle system . in order to solve the problem ,",
    "many schemes @xcite have been put forward . in 2014 , by using second - order perturbation approximation twice under large detuning condition and transitionless quantum driving , lu _",
    "et al . _ have proposed an effective scheme @xcite to implement the fast populations transfer and prepare a fast maximum entanglement between two atoms in a cavity .",
    "the idea inspires that using some traditional methods to approximate a complicated hamiltonian into an effective and simple one first , then constructing shortcuts for the effective hamiltonian might be a promising method to speed up evolution process of a system .",
    "later , chen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a promising method to construct stap for a three - atom system to generate ghz states in the cavity qed system in light of qzd and tqd .",
    "their schemes might be useful to realize fast and noise - resistant quantum information processing for multi - qubit system in current technology .    in this paper inspired by the schemes @xcite , we discuss how to construct stap to fastly",
    "generate a three - atom singlet state in cavity qed system by using the approach of `` transitionless tracking algorithm '' .",
    "based on quantum zeno dynamics @xcite and large detuning conditon , we can simplify the original hamiltonian of system and obtain the effective hamiltonian equivalent to the corresponding cdd hamiltonian , the evolution process of system can be speeded up , and the stap can be achieved in experiment easily .",
    "what s more , numerical investigation shows that our scheme is also fast and robust against both cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission for three - atom singlet state preparation",
    ". it will be much useful in dealing with the fast and noise - resistant generation of @xmath0-atom singlet state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    ", we describe a theoretical model for three atoms which are trapped in a bimodal - mode cavity . in section",
    ", we demonstrate how to construct stap for the system in section , and use the constructed shortcut to generate a three - atom singlet state . the numerical simulation and experimental discussion about the validity of the scheme",
    "are also given .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section .",
    "the sketch of the experimental setup is shown in figure 1 .",
    "three identical four - level atoms with three ground states @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and an excited state @xmath12 are trapped in a bimodal - mode cavity . the atomic transition @xmath13 is driven resonantly through classical laser field with time - dependent rabi frequency @xmath14 , the transition @xmath15 is coupled resonantly to the left - circularly polarized mode of the cavity with coupling @xmath16 , and transition @xmath17 is coupled resonantly to the right - circularly polarized mode of the cavity with coupling @xmath18 . under the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the interaction hamiltonian for this system reads ( @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the left - circularly and the right - circularly annihilation operators for cavity mode , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath23 for simplicity .",
    "if we assume the initial state of the system is @xmath24 , the system will evolve within a single - excitation subspace with basis states @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the eigenvectors of @xmath27 : @xmath28 with eigenvalues @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 through performing the unitary transformation @xmath37 and neglecting the terms with high oscillating frequency by setting the condition @xmath38 , we obtain an effective hamiltonian @xmath39 here we set @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we can see hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) as a simple three - level system with an excited state @xmath43 and two ground states @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for this effective hamiltonian , its eigenstates",
    "are easily obtained @xmath46 corresponding eigenvalues @xmath47 , @xmath48 , respectively , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "when the adiabatic condition @xmath51 is fulfilled , the initial state @xmath52 will follow @xmath53 closely , and when @xmath54 , we can obtain the three - atom singlet state : @xmath55 however , this process will take quite a long time to obtain the target state , which is undesirable .",
    "we will talk in later .",
    "the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) for the effective hamiltonian @xmath58 in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) do not satisfy the schrodinger equation @xmath59 . according to berry s transitionless tracking algorithm @xcite , from @xmath58 , one can reverse engineer @xmath7 which is related to the original hamiltonian @xmath60 and can drive the eigenstates exactly . from refs .",
    "@xcite , we learn the simplest hamiltonian @xmath7 is derived in the form @xmath61 substituting equation ( [ eq7 ] ) into equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63/\\omega^{2}$ ] . for this three - atom system ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 is hard or even impossible to be implemented in real experiment @xcite .",
    "we should find an alternative physically feasible ( apf ) hamiltonian whose effect is equivalent to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , we consider that the three atoms are trapped in a cavity and the atomic level configuration is shown in figure 2 .",
    "we make all the resonant atomic transitions into non - resonant atomic transitions with detuning @xmath64 .",
    "the non - resonant hamiltonian reads @xmath65 then similar to the approximation for the hamiltonian from equation ( [ eq2 ] ) to equation ( [ eq6 ] ) in section , we also obtain an effective hamiltonian for the present non - resonant system @xcite @xmath66 by adiabatically eliminating the state @xmath43 under the condition @xmath67 , we obtain the final effective hamiltonian @xmath68 when we choose @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( here @xmath71 is a real number ) , the first two terms can be removed , and the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq13 ] ) becomes @xmath72 that means , as long as @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the hamiltonian for speeding up the adiabatic dark state evolution governed by @xmath75 under condition @xmath76 has been constructed .",
    "hence , @xmath71 is given @xmath77    we will show the numerical analysis of the creation of a three - atom singlet state governed by @xmath75 . to satisfy the boundary condition of the fractional stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , @xmath78 the rabi frequencies @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the original hamiltonian @xmath60 are chosen as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the pulse amplitude , @xmath83 is the operation time , and @xmath84 , @xmath85 are some related parameters . in order to create a three - atom singlet state",
    ", the finial state @xmath86 should be @xmath87 according to equation ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath88 . and choosing parameters for the laser pulses suitably to fulfill the boundary condition in equation ( [ eq16 ] ) , the time - dependent @xmath79 and @xmath80 are gotten as shown in figure 3 with parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "figure 4 shows the relationship between the fidelity of the generated three - atom singlet state ( governed by the apf hamiltonian @xmath91 ) and two parameters @xmath64 and @xmath83 when @xmath92 , where the fidelity for the three - atom singlet state is given through @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the density operator of the whole system when @xmath95 ) .",
    "it s easy to find that there is a wide range of selectable values for parameters @xmath64 and @xmath83 to get a high fidelity . and",
    "the fidelity increases with the increasing of @xmath83 while decreases with the increasing of @xmath64 .",
    "this is easy to understand .",
    "if we set @xmath96 , according to equation ( [ eq17 ] ) , we can obtain two dimensionless parameters @xmath97 therefore , putting equations ( [ eq17 ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) into equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , we obtain @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a dimensionless function .",
    "a brief analysis of @xmath100 tells that the amplitude of @xmath100 is close to 1 .",
    "that is , the amplitude of @xmath71 is mainly dominated by @xmath101 . in order to satisfy the condition @xmath102 and @xmath103",
    ", we can work out @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "so , long @xmath83 can lead to a high fidelity as shown in figure 4 .",
    "when the detuning @xmath64 is smaller or near 0 , it s not meet the condition @xmath105 , so the fidelity is lower in a short time as shown in figure 4 .",
    "we know @xmath106 , shortening the evolution time implies that relative large laser intensities is required , and this would destroy the zeno condition .",
    "yet slightly destroying the zeno condition is also helpful to achieve the target state in a much shorter interaction time @xcite .",
    "next , to comfirm the operation time required for the creation of the three - atom singlet state governed by @xmath75 is much shorter than that governed by @xmath107 , we contrast the performances of population transfer from the initial state @xmath108 in figure 5 .",
    "the time - dependent population for any state @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the corresponding time - dependent density operator .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows time evolution of the populations for the states @xmath44 ( @xmath44 is the initial state @xmath108 ) and @xmath45 governed by the apf hamiltonian @xmath75 with @xmath92 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows time evolution of the populations for the states @xmath44 and @xmath45 governed by the original hamiltonian @xmath107 with @xmath92 and @xmath114 .",
    "the comparison of figure 5 ( a ) and ( b ) shows that with this set of parameters , the apf hamiltonian @xmath75 can govern the evolution to achieve a near - perfect three - atom singlet state from state @xmath108 in short interaction time while the original hamiltonian @xmath107 can not .",
    "we also plot the fidelities of the evolved states governed by @xmath75 and @xmath107 in figure 6 , with respect to the target three - atom singlet state . as shown in figure 6 , when the interaction time @xmath112 , the fidelity governed by @xmath75 is already 99.98% .",
    "while , when @xmath114 , the fidelity governed by @xmath107 achieves 99.93% . the interaction time required for creation of the three - atom singlet state via stap is much shorter than adiabatic passage .    since most of the parameters are hard to faultlessly achieve in experiment , we need to investigate the variations in the parameters induced by the experimental imperfection .",
    "we calculate the fidelity by varying error parameters of the mismatch between the laser amplitude @xmath82 and the total operation time @xmath83 , the detuning @xmath64 and the cavity mode with coupling constant @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "we define @xmath116 as the deviation of @xmath117 , here @xmath117 denotes the ideal value and @xmath118 denotes the actual value .",
    "then in figure 7(a ) we plot the fidelity of the three - atom singlet state versus the variations in total operation time @xmath83 and laser amplitude @xmath82 . in figure 7(b ) we plot the fidelity of the three - atom singlet state versus the variations in coupling constant @xmath115 and the detuning @xmath64 .",
    "we find that the scheme is robust against all of these variations .",
    "for example , a deviation @xmath119 and @xmath120 only causes a reduction about @xmath121 in the fidelity . in order to have a fair comparison , we show the influence of fluctuations versus total operation time @xmath83 and laser amplitude @xmath82 on the fidelity for the stirap in figure 8 . as we can find , the stirap scheme almost perfectly restrain the influence caused by the parameters fluctuations without doubt . nevertheless , in figure 7(a )",
    "we can find that the fidelity of the target state for the stap is still higher than @xmath122 even when the deviation @xmath123 , so we can say the scheme via stap is also robust against these variations .",
    "next , we will analyze the influence of dissipation induced by the atomic spontaneous emission and the cavity decay .",
    "the master equation of motion for the density matrix of the whole system can be expressed as @xmath124-\\sum_{j = r , l}\\frac{\\kappa_{j}}{2}(a_{j}^{\\dag}a_{j}\\rho-2a_{j}\\rho a_{j}^{\\dag}+\\rho a_{j}^{\\dag}a_{j } )   \\cr\\cr & -&\\sum_{n=1}^{3}\\sum_{p = g_{0},g_{1},g_{2}}\\frac{\\gamma_{n , p}}{2}(\\sigma_{n , p}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{n , p}\\rho-2\\sigma_{n , p}\\rho\\sigma_{n , p}^{\\dag}+\\rho\\sigma_{n , p}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{n , p}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the density operator for the whole system , @xmath126 is the spontaneous emission rate from the excited state @xmath12 to the ground states @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) of the @xmath129th ( @xmath130 ) atom .",
    "@xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) is the decay rate of the left(right)-circular cavity mode . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "figure 9(a ) and 9(b ) shows the fidelity of the three - atom singlet state governed by the apf hamiltonian @xmath75 versus @xmath135 and @xmath136 with @xmath137@xmath92 , @xmath113 , @xmath112@xmath138 and @xmath137@xmath92 , @xmath139 and @xmath112@xmath138 , respectively . we can find the fidelity @xmath140 decrease slowly with the increasing of cavity decay and atomic spontaneous emission .",
    "when @xmath141 , we still can create a three - atom singlet state with a high fidelity 91.03% as shown in figure 9(a ) . by comparing figure 9(a ) and ( b ) , we find the effect of the atomic spontaneous emission and cavity field dissipation varies with different parameters values .",
    "so , we plot the fidelity of the three - atom singlet state versus @xmath135 and @xmath142 with @xmath92 , @xmath112 , and @xmath143 in figure 10(a ) .",
    "figure 10(b ) shows the fidelity of the three - atom singlet state versus @xmath136 and @xmath142 with @xmath92 , @xmath112 , and @xmath144 .",
    "we find that when @xmath135 is nonzero , the fidelity @xmath140 decreases with the increasing of @xmath142 as shown in figure 10(a ) .",
    "when @xmath136 is nonzero , the fidelity @xmath140 increases with the increasing of @xmath142 as shown in figure 10(b ) .",
    "the phenomenon can be understood as follows . from equation ( [ eq19 ] ) , we know @xmath106 , so the laser @xmath71 increases with the increasing of detuning @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath64 is large enough , the zeno condition @xmath102 for the non - resonant system is not ideally fulfilled , then the intermediate states including the cavity - excited states would be populated during the evolution , which would cause the system to be sensitive to the cavity decays .",
    "in other words , as long as the detuning @xmath64 is small , the system is robust to the cavity decays as shown in figure 10 . but substituting equation ( [ eq19 ] ) into the condition @xmath103 , we deduce @xmath145 , it denotes large @xmath64 would be better .",
    "so , taking the two conditions into account , when the detuning @xmath146 , atomic spontaneous emission and cavity field dissipation have an equal influence in the fidelity . according to the sensitivity of experimental apparatus to the atomic spontaneous emission and cavity field dissipation",
    ", we can reasonably select different parameters in practical . as we know , in general in order to restrain atomic spontaneous emission in qzd and cavity decay in stirap , we introduce detuning between the atomic transition , and that increases the evolution time .",
    "however in our scheme we only need to select appropriate parameter to restrain atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay in a short time . to sum up , it is a better choice for the experimental researchers because the three - atom singlet state is generated much faster in the present shortcut scheme that contributes to the experimental research .    finally , we present a brief discussion about the basic factors for the experimental realization of a three - atom singlet state . in a real experiment ,",
    "the cesium atoms which have been cooled and trapped in a small optical cavity in the strong coupling regime @xcite can be used in this scheme .",
    "the state @xmath12 corresponds to @xmath147 hyperfine state of the @xmath148 electronic excited state , the state @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath147 hyperfine state of the @xmath149 electronic ground state , the state @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath150 hyperfine state of the @xmath149 electronic ground state , and the state @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath151 hyperfine state of the @xmath149 electronic ground state , respectively . in recent experimental conditions @xcite ,",
    "it is predicted to achieve the parameters @xmath152 mhz , @xmath153 mhz , and @xmath154 mhz and the optical cavity mode wavelength in a range between 630 and 850 nm . by substituting the ratios @xmath155 into equation ( [ eq21 ] )",
    ", we will obtain a high fidelity about 99.05% , which shows our scheme to prepare a three - atom singlet state is relatively robust . nowadays , according to the literature @xcite , the laser pulse which is used in our scheme",
    "can be obtained in a real experiment , so , our scheme is feasible in experiment .",
    "we have presented a promising method to construct shortcuts to adiabatic passage ( stap ) for a three - atom system to generate singlet state in the cavity qed system .",
    "we simplify a multi - qubit system and choose the laser pulses to implement the fast generation of entangled states in light of quantum zeno dynamics and `` transitionless quantum driving '' . in comparison to qzd",
    ", the significant feature is that we do not need to control the evolution time exactly . as comparing with the stirap ,",
    "the significant feature is the shorter evolution time .",
    "when dissipation is considered , we can find that the scheme is robust against the decoherence caused by both atomic spontaneous emission , photon leakage and operational imperfection .",
    "in addition , the present scheme only needs to select appropriate parameter to restrain atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay in a short time .",
    "numerical simulation result shows that the scheme has a high fidelity and may be possible to implement with the current experimental technology . in shorts ,",
    "the scheme is robust , effective and fast .",
    "actually , the present scheme in section can be effectively applied to @xmath0-atom system for preparation of @xmath0-atom singlet state .",
    "we hope our work be useful for the experimental realization of quantum information in the near future .",
