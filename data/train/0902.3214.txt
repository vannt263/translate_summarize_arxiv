    "strongly focused laser beams , produced by passage through a high numerical aperture ( na ) microscope objective , have been employed increasingly often in recent years .",
    "a widespread application is their use for trapping micro - particles @xcite or atoms @xcite in optical tweezers , employed in a variety of fields @xcite , ranging from cell biology @xcite to quantum information processing @xcite .    in the standard optical tweezers setup ,",
    "the objective entrance port is usually illuminated by a gaussian linearly polarized beam , overfilling the entrance aperture in order to fully utilize the high na of the objective .",
    "a proper description of such a tightly focused laser beam must include diffraction at the aperture edge as well as nonparaxial effects .",
    "the vectorial debye - type integral representation developed by richards and wolf ( rw ) @xcite takes both effects into account .",
    "this model has been thoroughly verified directly , by measuring the electric energy density distribution in the focal region @xcite , and also indirectly , by testing the mie - debye theory for the trapping force in optical tweezers ( derived from the rw model @xcite ) against experimental results @xcite .",
    "novel features , with potential applications in micromechanics , microfluidics and biotechnology , have been developed by employing laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams @xcite .",
    "these beams have helical wave fronts and a phase singularity along the axis ( optical vortex ) @xcite . since paraxial lg beams have enhanced gradient forces and reduced radiation pressure , they produce more efficient trapping @xcite . more importantly ,",
    "since they carry orbital angular momentum @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) , they allow rotational control of the trapped particles . by transferring orbital angular momentum to absorptive particles , such particles were set to rotate @xcite .",
    "the photon spin , which is associated with the beam circular polarization , can be employed to add or subtract from the effect of the orbital angular momentum @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "the particle can be trapped off - axis , near the ring of maximum intensity , and set to rotate about the beam axis @xcite . by using a spatial light modulator , it is possible to scan the orbital index @xmath3 up to values of order @xmath5 and analyze the resulting rotation about the beam symmetry axis as a function of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we consider a circularly polarized ( paraxial ) laguerre - gaussian @xmath6 ( radial index @xmath7 ) model for the beam incident along the positive @xmath8-axis _ before _ the objective , and then apply the rw approach to calculate the resulting strongly focused beam beyond the objective .",
    "ganic , gan and gu calculated the electric energy density on the focal plane for a linearly - polarized lg beam @xcite and showed that the intensity at the focus does not vanish when @xmath9 or @xmath10 . this effect becomes stronger for a circularly polarized incident beam @xcite , with the photon spin anti - parallel to the orbital angular momentum ( the intensity at the focus vanishes when they are parallel ) .",
    "the experimental verification of this remarkable effect provided an additional test of the rw approach @xcite .    here",
    "we present a detailed theoretical analysis of the focused beam , elucidating the spatial variations of field polarization , energy density and poynting vector .",
    "we find some unexpected results when the spin and orbital angular momenta of the incident beam are antiparallel .",
    "in this situation , the interplay between polarization and angular dependence is particularly interesting , resulting in a strong modification of the focused beam polarization near the beam axis .",
    "the discussion of angular momentum is of particular theoretical relevance .",
    "the identification of separate spin and orbital contributions to the angular momentum of electromagnetic fields is somewhat controversial @xcite , at least in the sense that the corresponding operators do not satisfy the commutation relations of ` true ' angular momenta in the full quantum theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the separation presents itself in a very compelling way in the paraxial approximation , with spin and orbital contributions corresponding to the field polarization and the angular spatial dependence , respectively @xcite . with @xmath11 corresponding to left(right)-handed circular polarization ,",
    "the spin and orbital angular momenta along the propagation direction per photon are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . in the framework of the classical ( i.e. non - quantal ) paraxial theory ,",
    "these important results are inferred from the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the ratios between the linear densities of angular momenta and energy .    in the nonparaxial regime",
    "the separation is not so straightforward , as far as local quantities are concerned @xcite .",
    "however , a natural separation was proposed by barnett @xcite in terms of the overall angular momentum flux along the propagation direction .",
    "we calculate the angular momentum flux for the focused nonparaxial beam , and compare the separate spin and orbital contributions , as defined by barnett , with the corresponding values for the paraxial beam before the objective .",
    "recently , zhao and co - workers have argued that the focusing effect leads to an interconversion between spin and orbital angular momenta @xcite .",
    "we derive quantitative results for the spin and orbital flux modifications , which turn out , however , to have signs in disagreement with zhao _ et al _ s qualitative discussion",
    "since their arguments , as well as their experimental demonstration , involve local quantities , we attribute the disagreement to the fact that we calculate the _ global _ overall flux across a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction , rather than local results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we analyze the local polarization on the focal plane in sec .",

    "we assume that the beam waist ( radius @xmath16 ) is precisely at the position of the objective entrance port .",
    "the incident circularly polarized electric field is then given by ( the factor @xmath17 is omitted ) @xmath18 the minimum spot size @xmath19 is typically of the order of or larger than the entrance aperture radius ( overfilling ) , so as to take full advantage of the high na of the objective . the focused beam ( focal length @xmath20 ) is written as a superposition of plane waves . according to kirchhoff s approximation of classical diffraction theory @xcite , the amplitude and phase of each plane wave component @xmath21 ( @xmath22 wavenumber in the isotropic medium of refractive index @xmath23 )",

    "radial dependence of objective transmittance , which may be present , can be taken into account by introducing an effective beam waist size @xcite .",
    "if the beam is gaussian at the entrance port ( @xmath29 ) , all plane wave components in ( [ focusedfield ] ) have the same phase at the focal position @xmath30 and hence interfere constructively to produce a maximum intensity at this point . on the other hand , for a laguerre - gaussian beam",

    "this is in sharp contrast with the usual paraxial models , where approximate solutions of the maxwell equations are employed and diffraction is completely neglected ( the beam waist size is usually assumed to be much smaller than the transverse sizes of the optical elements ) .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are linear combinations of terms of the form @xmath50 .",
    "since the phase factor is ill - defined on the beam axis ( phase singularity ) , consistency requires that the functions @xmath51 vanish at @xmath52 , _ except _ when @xmath53 .",
    "this important property is verified by replacing the result @xmath54 into ( [ i ] ) .    the electric and magnetic field components @xmath55 and @xmath56 have no phase singularity when @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( anti - parallel incident beam orbital and spin angular momenta ) .",
    "in this situation , the vectors @xmath48 and @xmath59 oscillate along the beam axis in phase quadrature .    there is a second situation with non - vanishing axial intensity : @xmath60 @xmath61 . from ( [ ex ] ) and ( [ ey ] ) , we find , on the axis , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that the field on the axis is circularly polarized as in the entrance port",

    "the objective maps each of these vectors to the focal point by three - dimensional transport , constrained by the condition that its angle with respect to the plane of incidence ( containing @xmath34 and the axis ) is conserved .",
    "thus , the cylindrical azimuthal components ( which are perpendicular to the incidence plane ) are transported parallel to themselves , whereas the cylindrical radial components yield a @xmath8 component proportional to @xmath67 and a component on the @xmath66 plane proportional to @xmath68 . in the following qualitative discussion for @xmath69",
