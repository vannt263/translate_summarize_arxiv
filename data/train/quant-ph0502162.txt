    "a puzzling experiment was reported by strekalov et al @xcite which was appropriately called ghost interference .",
    "the experiment was a dramatic demonstration of the nonlocal nature of correlations that exist in spatially separated , entangled particles .",
    "we briefly describe strekalov et al s experiment .",
    "a source s sends two entangled photons from spdc , which we call photon 1 and photon 2 ( see fig .",
    "a double - slit is placed in the path of photon 1 .",
    "surprisingly , no first order interference is observed for photon 1 . for photon 2 , first order interference is neither expected , nor is it seen .",
    "then a lone detector is placed behind the double slit , and the position of photon 2 is detected _ in coincidence with the detector behind the double slit_. photon 2 shows an interference pattern which is very similar to a double - slit interference pattern , even though there is no double - slit in the path of photon 2 .",
    "another curious thing about the observed interference is that it is the same as what one would observe if one were to replace the lone detector behind the double slit , with the source of light , and the spdc source were absent . in other words ,",
    "the standard young s double slit interference formula works , if the distance is taken to be the distance between the screen ( detector ) on which photon 2 registers , right through the spdc source crystal , to the double slit .",
    "photon 2 never passes through the region between the source s and the double slit .",
    "zeilinger s group performed a ghost interference experiment using an optical grating @xcite .",
    "ghost interference has become a subject of experimental and theoretical research attention @xcite .",
    "strekalov et al attribute the absence of first order interference in photon 1 to the large momentum spread of photon 1 -  the ` blurring out ' of the first order interference is due to the considerably large angular propagation uncertainty of a single spdc photon \" @xcite .",
    "we will show that there is a more fundamental reason why a first order interference can never be observed in an experiment with entangled photons . for explaining ghost interference , strekalov et al present a geometrical model which satisfactorily reproduces the observed pattern .",
    "however , we believe that the mechanism behind the emergence of ghost interference can be understood better by looking at it from a different perspective . in this paper",
    ", we present this new way of looking at ghost interference .",
    "we will also show that an interference for photon 1 can be observed , under certain conditions .",
    "at the heart of this effect is the phenomenon of entanglement , which applies as much to massive particles , as to photons . for clarity",
    ", we will analyze the ghost interference experiment using entangled particles , rather than photons .",
    "the results can easily be applied to the case of photons .",
    "let there be two particles of identical mass , generated at the source s , in an entangled state .",
    "we assume the entangled state to be of the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constant necessary for the normalization of @xmath2 . without the @xmath3 term ,",
    "the state ( [ state ] ) is infinitely extended in space .",
    "so , we introduce the term @xmath3 , for a realistic situation .",
    "this is a momentum entangled state , which is fairly general , barring the use of gaussian functions .",
    "integration over @xmath4 can be performed to obtain : @xmath5 the physical meaning of the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 will become clear if we calculate the uncertainty in position and momentum of the two particles .",
    "the uncertainty in momenta of the two particles is given by @xmath8 the position uncertainty of the two particles is given by @xmath9 so , now we know the position and momentum spread of both the particles in this state . with time , the particles travel along the positive and negative x - axis .",
    "the motion in the x - direction is disjoint from the evolution in the y - direction , and is unaffected by entanglement .",
    "so , in order to see the effect of the double slit on particle 1 , we will assume that state evolves for a time @xmath10 before particle 1 reaches the double - slit .",
    "imagine the slit to be a position filter - it allows portions of the wavefunction in front of the slit , to go through .",
    "let us assume that what passes through a slit is a localized gaussian packet , whose width is the width of the slit .",
    "so , if the two slits are a and b , the packets which pass through will be , say , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the entangled state at time @xmath10 , @xmath13 , can then be expanded in terms of components parallel to @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and perpendicular to those .",
    "we can write @xmath14 represents rest of the states in the hilbert space , orthogonal to @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "so , the states of particle 2 that one has to calculate are @xmath15    so , the state we get after particle 1 crosses the double - slit is : @xmath16 are states of particle 1 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are states of particle 2 .",
    "the first two terms represent the amplitudes of particle 1 passing through the slits , and the last term represents it getting reflected / blocked .",
    "because of the linearity of schrodinger equation , these two pieces of the wavefunction will evolve independently , without affecting each other .",
    "because we are interested only in the particle 1 , which passes through the slit , we might as well throw away the term which represents particle 1 not passing through the slits .",
    "if we do that , we have to normalize the remaining part of the wavefunction , which looks like @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "after coming out of the slits , particle 1 travels in time , and reaches the d1 where it is detected . in the mean time , particle 2 also undergoes a unitary time evolution .",
    "the state at a later time @xmath21 , can be written as @xmath22 , \\label{whichway}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 represents the time evolution operator for particle 2 .",
    "the state ( [ whichway ] ) represents particle 1 passing through a double - slit , but if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are orthogonal , the amplitudes of particle 1 passing through the two slits are correlated with two distinguishable states of particle 2 .",
    "hence , in principle , a measurement on particle 2 can reveal which slit particle 1 passed through . according to the complementarity principle",
    ", no interference can be observed in such a situation .",
    "so , no interference can be seen in particle 1 because particle 2 carries the  which - way \" information about particle 1 .",
    "this is the fundamental reason for photon 1 not showing interference in the ghost interference experiment , and not its large momentum spread .",
    "the argument presented above can be cast in a mathematical language by calculating the probability density of particle 1 on the screen , which is given by : @xmath24 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are orthogonal , the last two terms in the above equation , which represent interference , will disappear .",
    "hence no first order interference can be seen for particle 1 .      in order to explain ghost interference , we need to consider explicit functional form of @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in the following , we assume that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are gaussian functions in space : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the y - position of slit a and b , respectively , and @xmath29 their widths .",
    "thus , the distance between the two slits is @xmath30 . to account for the full phase information in the particles",
    ", one should also consider the evolution for a time @xmath10 , before particle 1 reaches the double - slit .",
    "the state of the entangled system , after this time evolution , can be calculated using the hamiltonian governing the time evolution , given by @xmath31 after a time @xmath10 , ( [ newstate ] ) assumes the form @xmath32",
    "\\exp\\left[{-(y_1+y_2)^2\\over \\left(\\omega^2   + { i\\hbar t_0\\over m}\\right ) } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{psit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we wish to point out that the use of ( [ h ] ) is not an absolute necessity for obtaining the time evolution of the state .",
    "for example , if one considers the particle to be an envelope of waves , the time evolution can be obtained easily . in that case ,",
    "@xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the wave - vector value where @xmath35 peaks , plays the role of @xmath36 .",
    "the time evolution for a photon state can be obtained similarly @xcite . using ( [ psi ] ) and",
    "( [ psit ] ) , wavefunctions @xmath17 , @xmath18 can be calculated , which , after normalization , have the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40    the state which passes through the double slit , now assumes the form @xmath41 equation ( [ virtual ] ) represents two wave - packets of particle 1 , of width @xmath29 , and localized at @xmath28 , entangled with two wave - packets of particle 2 , of width @xmath42 , localized at @xmath43 .",
    "so , because of entanglement , particle 2 also behaves as if it has passed through a double - slit of separation @xmath44 . in other words , because of entanglement , particle 1 passing through the double - slit , creates a _ virtual double - slit _ for particle 2 .",
    "this view also agrees with the observed optical imaging by means of entangled photons @xcite .",
    "it appears natural that particle 2 , passing through this virtual double - slit , should show an interference pattern .",
    "however , this can happen only when the wave - packets overlap , after evolving in time .    before reaching detector d2 ,",
    "particle 2 evolves for a time @xmath21 .",
    "the time evolution , governed by ( [ h ] ) , transforms the state ( [ virtual ] ) to @xmath45 where @xmath46 before proceeding further , we need to simplify the expression for @xmath47 .",
    "we assume the spatial extent of the wave - function @xmath48 to be large , namely , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in this limit , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the probability of finding particle 1 at @xmath54 and particle 2 at @xmath55 .",
    "this is given by @xmath56 ) , \\label{pattern}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 we can now make contact with the ghost interference experiment , where detector d1 is kept fixed and detector d2 is scanned along the y - axis .",
    "if we fix @xmath54 , the cosine term in ( [ pattern ] ) represents oscillations as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that if particle 2 is detected in coincidence with particle 1 being detected at a fixed position @xmath54 , then it shows interference .",
    "this is ghost interference . in the expression for @xmath58 ,",
    "@xmath59 is a measure of the width of the virtual slits created because of particle 1 passing through the double - slit .",
    "so , it is clear that the ghost interference is an effect due to the virtual slits formed for particle 2 , because of a measurement on the spatially separated particle 1 .",
    "this is what karl popper , the philosopher of science , was uncomfortable about .",
    "he had proposed an experiment aimed at disproving such a nonlocal influence @xcite . but ghost interference shows much more than what popper s experiment aimed to disprove .      coming back to ghost interference , one might wonder that if the virtual slits are created by particle 1 passing through the double - slit , what is the need for fixing detector d1 and doing a coincident count .",
    "the answer is , particle 1 carries which - way information about particle 2 .",
    "meaning , particle 1 can be potentially detected in such a manner that would tell us which virtual slit , a or b , did particle 2 pass through . and bohr s complementarity principle tells us that in such a situation , interference can not be observed . by detecting particle 1 at a fixed position , where contributions from both the slits are present , we add the two contributions , and thus _ erase _ the information about which slit particle 1 , and particle 2 , passed through",
    "once the which - way information is erased , the interference can come back , and it does .",
    "so , the mechanism behind the appearance of ghost interference is essentially _ quantum erasure _ @xcite .",
    "scully englert and walther proposed a setup for quantum eraser , where the which - way detector is a two - state system @xcite .",
    "quantum erasure is performed when the particles are detected in coincidence with one of the two states of the which - way detector .",
    "corresponding to the two states of the which - way detector , two interference patterns are obtained which are complementary , meaning , they add up to give no interference . in the case of ghost interference , the role of the which - way detector states is played by the position of d1 , which is a continuous variable . from ( [ pattern ] ) , one can see that for a fixed @xmath54 , the term @xmath60 acts as an extra phase for the cosine function in @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the whole interference pattern is shifted , depending on the position of d1 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , so that when all the d1 positions are added , it results in the destruction of the interference pattern .",
    "this is the reason why , in strekalov et al s experiment , no interference for photon 2 is observed without coincident counting with a fixed d1 .",
    "one must have already noticed something strange about ( [ pattern ] ) , namely , in the terms for particle 2 , the time which appears is @xmath61 as opposed to just @xmath21 for particle 1 . in the actual experiment , time is not what is the meaningful quantity - it is the distance the particle travels , that is relevant .",
    "let us translate our results to the situation where one just measures the distance .",
    "for that we assume that particle 2 travels along the x - axis , with a momentum @xmath4 . in time",
    "@xmath10 , both particle 1 and particle 2 travel a distance @xmath62 . during time @xmath21",
    ", particle 1 travels a distance @xmath63 to reach d1 , and particle 2 travels the same distance to reach d2 .",
    "so , the time @xmath61 corresponds to the distance between the double - slit and d2 , that is , @xmath64 .",
    "using this strategy , we can write @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the dbroglie wavelength of the particle and @xmath67 its velocity . the expression @xmath68 will also hold for a photon provided , one uses the wavelength of the photon in place of @xmath66 .",
    "the probability of coincident click of d1 and d2 is given by @xmath69 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\exp\\left[-{2(y_1+y_0)^2\\over\\epsilon^2+(\\lambda_d l_1/m\\epsilon)^2 } -{2(y_2 + y_0)^2 \\over \\gamma^2+(\\lambda_d d/\\pi\\gamma)^2}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\exp\\left[-{2(y_1 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2)\\over\\epsilon^2+(\\lambda_d l_1/\\pi\\epsilon)^2 } -{2(y_2 ^ 2 + y_0",
    "^ 2 ) \\over \\gamma^2+(\\lambda_d d/\\pi\\gamma)^2}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times 2\\cos\\left[\\theta_1 y_1 + \\theta_2 y_2\\right ] ) , \\label{plot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( [ plot ] ) tells us that the fringe width of the pattern for particle 2 is given by @xmath72 for @xmath73 , we get the familiar young s double - slit interference formula , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the separation between the slits .",
    "notice that @xmath64 is the strange distance from the detector d2 , right through the source , to the double slit .",
    "particle 2 never passes through the region between the source and the double - slit .",
    "this is exactly what was observed in strekalov et al s experiment .",
    "although the virtual double - slit for particle 2 comes into being only after particle 2 travels a distance @xmath62 from the source , the particle carries with itself the phase information of its evolution from the source for the time @xmath10 .",
    "because of coincident counting , the change in phase because of the evolution of particle 1 is added to that of particle 2 , and _ it appears as if _ particle 2 traveled a distance @xmath76 , which is double the actually traveled distance .",
    "so , we see that although the virtual double - slit comes into being after particle 1 enters the real double - slit , for all practical purposes , _ it appears as if _ the virtual double - slit is located exactly at the real double - slit , _ behind the source_. we should also mention that for values of various parameters corresponding to strekalov et al s experiment , their results are faithfully reproduced by ( [ plot ] ) .",
    "( [ plot ] ) is reasonably symmetric in @xmath54 and @xmath55 , except for the difference in the widths of the real and virtual slits , and @xmath63 appearing for particle 1 , and @xmath64 appearing for particle 2 .",
    "it is but natural to expect that by fixing d2 at some @xmath55 , and counting particle 1 in coincidence with d2 , should show an interference .",
    "the fringe width of the interference pattern is given by @xmath77 the fringe width is exactly what one would expect from a conventional first order interference . in this sense",
    ", this pattern is not as spectacular as that for particle 2 .",
    "the term @xmath78 now acts as an additional phase of the cosine , and this leads to a shift in the interference pattern for particle 1 if the position of d2 is changed .",
    "from the preceding analysis , we conclude that in the ghost interference experiment , the reason for the absence of first order interference for particle 1 is that the which - way information for particle 1 , is carried by particle 2 . by complementarity , no interference can be observed in such a situation , in principle .",
    "particle 2 can show interference because it experiences a virtual double - slit due to particle 1 passing through the double - slit .",
    "however , particle 1 carries which - way information about particle 2 , and that washes out any potential interference . by fixing d1 and doing a coincident count of particle 2 ,",
    "one is erasing the which - way information .",
    "this quantum erasure leads to the appearance of ghost interference in particle 2 .",
    "a corollary of the result is that particle 1 can also show interference if it is detected in coincidence with a fixed d2 .",
    "the general analysis presented here shows that ghost interference can be observed for entangled massive particles too ."
