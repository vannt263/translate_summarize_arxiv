    "among the five regular convex polyhedra , the regular tetrahedron and the cube are examples of simple rational convex polyopes .",

    "* chapter vi ) .",
    "the regular octahedron is still rational , but it is no longer simple . the toric variety associated to the regular octahedron is however well known and is described , for example , by fulton in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the regular dodecahedron , on the other hand , is simple but it is the first of the five regular convex polyhedra that is not rational .",
    "it is shown by prato in @xcite that , by applying her extension of the delzant procedure to the case of general simple convex polytopes @xcite , one can associate to the regular dodecahedron a _ symplectic toric quasifold_. quasifolds are a generalization of manifolds and orbifolds : they are not necessarily hausdorff and they are locally modeled by the quotient of a manifold modulo the action of a discrete group .    in this article , we recall all of the above and we complete the picture , first of all , by associating to the regular dodecahedron a _",

    "we go on to address the case of the regular icosahedron . from the toric viewpoint , this is certainly the most complicated of the five regular convex polyhedra , since it is neither simple nor rational . however , we can apply generalizations by battaglia and prato @xcite and battaglia @xcite of toric quasifolds @xcite and of the cox construction @xcite to arbitrary convex polytopes ; this allows us to associate to the regular icosahedron , both in the symplectic and complex category , a space that is stratified by quasifolds . as for all @xmath4dimensional polytopes , here there are only zero  dimensional singular strata and an open dense regular stratum .",

    "notice , finally , that we are still missing a symplectic toric space corresponding to the regular octahedron ; this too can be found by applying battaglia s work on arbitrary convex polytopes . what we get here is a space that is stratified by symplectic manifolds ( see ( * ? ? ? *",

    "we remark that the nonsimple rational case was addressed also by burns ",

    "let us now examine the complex case . here",

    "we conclude by pointing out that @xmath117 has two different kinds of singularities , namely the stratification and the quasifold structure of the strata .",
