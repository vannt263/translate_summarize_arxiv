    "we derive exact analytical formulas for the rht between two parallel slabs subject to arbitrary temperature profiles and demonstrate the existence of several asymptotic low - distance @xmath0 behaviors : depending on the values and derivatives of the temperature profile at points near the slab  vacuum interfaces , the flux can diverge as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or logarithmically , or approach a constant , as @xmath6 . we show that the temperature profile of the slabs can be tailored so as to modify and even reverse the direction of the flux over tunable distances . as described in  @xcite , such temperature gradients can naturally arise due to the interplay of conduction and radiation at nanometric scales , leading to constant ( rather than diverging ) flux rates as @xmath7 , even in the absence of phonon or non - local tunneling effects  @xcite .",
    "the impact of temperature profile on the properties of rht remains so far almost unexplored .",

    "it is instructive to compare one of the above configurations , @xmath114k , to the more standard scenario of uniform - temperature slabs : @xmath115k and @xmath116k .",
    "the results , shown in the inset of fig .

    "such a flip leads to a situation in which the bulk ( @xmath118 ) and surface ( @xmath119 ) temperatures compete , contributing rht in opposite directions .",
    "as before , the behavior at asymptotically small @xmath0 is determined by  ( [ phi0 ] ) and ( [ phi1 ] ) ( dotted lines ) , except that in the case of flipped @xmath120 ( dashed lines ) , the rht goes from positive to negative ( reversing sign ) as @xmath0 decreases , with the transition distance occuring anywhere from a few to hundreds of nm , depending on @xmath121 . such a surface - temperature inversion could potentially be engineered ( and tuned ) via the introduction of an external pump or thermostat .",

    "figure  [ fig3](c ) on the other hand also illustrates the appearance of logarithmic behavior by considering a situation consisting of fixed @xmath129k but where the intervening temperature profile is chosen to have different polynomial dependencies ( shown on the top inset ) , including linear ( @xmath87 , black ) , quadratic ( @xmath94 , red ) , cubic ( @xmath130 , orange ) , and quartic ( @xmath131 , blue ) power laws . while the sub-@xmath2 behavior associated with the @xmath132 profiles",
    "is apparent from the main plot , the three curves are better distinguished in the inset of the figure , which shows the slow , logarithmic scaling associated with the @xmath94 profile , plotted in conjunction with the predictions of  ( [ phi2 ] ) ( dotted line ) , along with the fact that rht approaches a constant for @xmath133 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] focuses on the role of the thicknesses @xmath134 and external temperature @xmath12 on the sign - flip effect explored in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , considering the reference scenario @xmath114k .",
    "we first fix @xmath135k and vary the thickness , from @xmath136 nm to @xmath137 m ( black , red , and blue lines ) , demonstrating a decreasing zero - flux distance , from 10 nm to 2 nm , with decreasing thickness . fixing @xmath138 m and modifying instead the external temperature , from @xmath139k to @xmath140k , produces similar variations on the zero - flux distance , from 4 nm to 10 nm .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] yields even more insights on ways of manipulating the asymptotic behavior , showing the rht ( multiplied by @xmath0 ) for the same three values of @xmath141 explored in the main figures , but under different surface temperatures ( or gradients ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the case @xmath142k , illustrating the expected @xmath1 scaling behavior .",
    "it follows from  ( [ phi0 ] ) that in this case the asymptotic rht depends only on the two temperatures @xmath14 and @xmath15 and not on their derivatives , which explains why the three dashed lines approach one another as @xmath143 .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the case @xmath144k and illustrate the expected @xmath2 behavior , revealing an asymptotic prefactor that decreases with decreasing temperature gradients , as predicted by  ( [ phi1 ] ) .",
    "the approach we presented , valid for arbitrary materials and distances and based on a scattering - matrix formalism , leads to analytical expressions of the short - distance behavior of the flux .",
    "we have shown that the latter is entirely determined by the gradient expansion of the temperature profile near the slab  vacuum interfaces .",
    "in particular , we find that apart from the well - known @xmath1 power - law scaling , under certain conditions , the flux can diverge asymptotically either as @xmath2 or logarithmically , or it can also saturate to a constant value .",
    "we have shown that the introduction of a temperature profile can result in significant flux tunability , leading for instance to changes in the sign of the flux with respect to slab separations .",
    "these findings can be relevant at distances of hundreds to tens of nanometers and below , where the coupling between rht and conduction alone can produce observable temperature gradients  @xcite .",
    "our approach would be needed to accurately describe radiative heat transfer under these conditions .",
    "in fact , recent experiments are beginning to explore such short distance regime ( down to sub - nanometer separations  @xcite ) , some of which have already observed a saturating flux that has yet to be properly explained .",
