    "the introduction of computer simulation methods has been a breakthrough in the study of phase transitions in lattice models .",
    "the rapid increase on the computers power has enabled to analyze with great accuracy the scaling laws , governed by the critical exponents , and even the corrections to these scaling laws . in such analysis ,",
    "finite size effects must be taken into account carefully  @xcite .",
    "one of these effects , the disturbance from the boundary , has usually been dismissed by the adoption of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "nevertheless , in some situations the adoption of periodic lattices may not be adequate , either for practical or theoretical reasons .",
    "this is the case of the free boundary conditions used in the analysis of free surfaces , or the so called boundary fields , used in the analysis of wetting phenomena . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on a particular election of the boundary conditions , the so called fixed boundary conditions ( fbc ) , which have been recently applied to spin models  @xcite and gauge models  @xcite .",
    "second order phase transitions exhibit universality .",
    "for this reason , all the details of the system near the phase transition point become irrelevant for the critical exponents . by contrast , first order phase transitions are not universal and , hence , all details of a simulation must be considered carefully .",
    "this includes , in particular , the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "what are the appropriate set of scaling laws for a first order phase transition with fbc ? this is the question we address in this paper .",
    "starting from the theoretical analysis of borgs and kotecky  @xcite and the diploma thesis of medved  @xcite on the dynamics of first order transitions , we present the finite size scaling laws applicable to the case of fbc and we check them performing a numerical simulation of the 2-d 8-state spin potts model  @xcite with fbc .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii a brief summary of some recent simulations where fbc have been adopted serves as a motivation for a detailed analysis of the finite size scaling laws which are also presented and discussed .",
    "section iii is devoted to a discussion of our numerical simulation and the results that we have obtained . in section",
    "iv we analyze our results in the light of the scaling laws presented in sec .",
    "finally , in section v we give some concluding remarks .",
    "recently , the so called _ gonihedric spin models_have been proposed as a laboratory to study discrete versions of string theories  @xcite .",
    "all these simulations have been performed imposing standard periodic boundary conditions on a three - dimensional lattice .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases three intersecting inner planes of spins were fixed to break the large energy degeneracy of the hamiltonian@xcite . due to the periodicity of the boundaries , this is equivalent to fix the spins belonging to the six planes of the 2-d boundary of the 3-d cube formed by the spins . since for a certain range of the coupling parameter , in particular for @xmath5 ,",
    "the transition is clearly of first order , the analysis of the finite size effects should have been done using the scaling laws presented in this paper .",
    "we expect that the application of the fbc scaling laws may overcome some anomalies recently observed in the analysis of this transition  @xcite .",
    "another situation where the knowledge of the fbc scaling laws seems to be crucial is the issue of the triviality of lattice",
    "qed . indeed , it has been claimed that the formation of artificial monopole structures , which close over the boundaries , in a simulation of the 4-d u(1 ) gauge model may be responsible for turning the phase transition of this model from second to first order  @xcite . to avoid this problem , originated probably by an incorrect choice of the boundaries",
    ", it was suggested to perform the monte carlo simulations on a lattice with a topology of an sphere . along these lines ,",
    "baig and fort@xcite proposed the adoption of fbc to simulate an spherical topology .",
    "effectively , to fix all the variables belonging to the 3-d border to unity is the higher dimensional equivalent of converting a 2-d plane square lattice to the 2-d surface of a sphere by collapsing the lines of the border to a single point .",
    "nevertheless , to discriminate between a first or a second order nature for a transition , an accurate analysis of data produced is necessary , and , in particular , this will be only possible if one knows for certain the applicable scaling laws .",
    "although speaking properly no critical exponents can be defined for first order phase transitions , it is usual to define a set of characteristic exponents , together with a set of scaling laws borrowed from those of the second order phase transitions . the pioneering work of privman and fisher  @xcite , binder and landau  @xcite and challa _ et al .",
    "@xcite , provided a phenomenological understanding of the scaling for first order transitions .",
    "a more rigorous theoretical justification for these first order scaling laws was presented by borgs and kotecky  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of its applicability to finite size scaling expressions in terms of the lattice size was the work of borgs , kotecky and miracle - sol  @xcite and , independently , of janke  @xcite .",
    "but in all these developments the existence of periodic boundary conditions was assumed .",
    "recently , though , borgs and kotecky  @xcite have extended their analysis to include surface effects in addition to the standard volume effects which govern first order transitions . following this work ,",
    "mendev  @xcite has deduced the scaling laws for the spin potts model in the presence of surface effects , in particular adopting boundary conditions other than the periodic ones .    following the general analysis of mendev  @xcite , finite size scaling laws in terms of the lattice size for the case of fixed boundary conditions",
    "can easily be deduced .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ tab : scal - laws ] , together with the standard laws for periodic conditions . in the rest of this paper",
    "we will check these modified scaling laws with the results of our numerical simulation .",
    "it should be noticed that the suggestion that in the case of free boundary conditions every transition is shifted by a @xmath6 correction term caused by surface effects is quite old .",
    "binder  @xcite , for instance , reports on a series of experimental results  @xcite supporting this conclusion .    ._scaling laws for periodic and fixed boundary conditions .",
    "_ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : e - ord - dis ]",
    "the first order phase transition finite - size scaling laws for fixed boundary condition lattices of borgs - kotecky - medved have been presented , tested and shown to be the only ones that hold for the 2d 8-state potts model .",
    "it is clear from our analysis that monte carlo simulations for fbc are necessarily going to be much more time consuming than those for pbc , since for pbc the system sets into the finite - size scaling region as @xmath7 , while for fbc it does it at the slower pace of @xmath8 . besides",
    ", we have found that the latent heat is affected by the boundaries .",
