    "molecular dynamics , by the spatial and temporal scales it involves , straddles the borderline between quantum and classical behavior .",
    "quantum effects  above all the very concept of chemical reaction  are obviously crucial .",
    "notwithstanding , a good deal of a molecule s external and even internal motion can be understood on purely classical grounds : precisely the situation for which semiclassical methods have been conceived and are optimally suited .",
    "moreover , recent developments in chemical physics , experimental as well as theoretical , are advancing vigorously in the direction of complex time evolution and high excitations .",
    "this faces adiabatic techniques like even time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite and time - dependent hartree @xcite with formidable challenges while it favors semiclassical approaches which do not suffer from limitations in this respect .",
    "therefore , the modest renaissance semiclassics in the time domain ( for a comprehensive review see @xcite ) is presently enjoying comes as no surprise .",
    "it includes approaches in configuration space as well as less established phase - space methods .",
    "the well - known shortcomings plagueging semiclassics in coordinate representation ( based on wkb approximations @xcite and the van - vleck ",
    "gutzwiller propagator @xcite ) , such as divergences at caustics and the root - search problem , have largely been overcome by sophisticated refinements of the original method @xcite .",
    "remarkably , most of them already switch internally to mixed representations ( combining position with momentum ) or full phase space in order to smooth out divergences and to reduce the set of contributing classical solutions to the neighbourhood of a single trajectory , permitting the construction of initial - value representations ( ivrs ) : uniform approximations , semiclassical ivrs @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) , gaussian - wavepacket propagation @xcite with its numerous ramifications , notably the herman - kluk propagator and heller s cellular dynamics @xcite . a similar but independent approach , the dephasing representation @xcite employs the shadowing lemma for chaotic dynamics to represent the classical flow through a planck cell by a single trajectory in a semiclassical approximation for correlation functions .",
    "these methods have gained widespread acceptance in practical applications but tend to be technically cumbersome .",
    "their implementation in _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics simulation with `` on the fly '' update of the electronic evolution @xcite has been proposed .",
    "it has to cope , though , with the high computational costs of calculating hessians for the potential - energy surface of the electron sector ",
    "so much so that recourse is sought even at a complete suppression of determinantal prefactors @xcite .",
    "semiclassical approximations working directly in phase space promise a fresh , structurally more transparent approach .",
    "they are inherently free of the above problems and thus offer a number of tempting advantages : ( i ) phase - space propagation provides a natural exact ivr by construction , without gaussian smoothing , ( ii ) it can be formulated exclusively in terms of canonically invariant quantities ( no projection required ) that ( iii ) allow for simple geometrical interpretations , ( iv ) as far as determinantal prefactors arise , they are also canonically invariant , and ( v ) being based on the density operator , not on wavefunctions , the extension to non - unitary time evolution is immediate , opening access to decoherence and dissipation @xcite .",
    "yet there is a price to be paid .",
    "the two representations mainly considered as candidates for semiclassical phase - space propagation both come with their specific virtues and vices : the husimi function @xcite is based on coherent states @xcite , hence closely related to semiclassical ivrs and gaussian - wavepacket propagation .",
    "coherent states possess a natural interpretation in terms of classical probabilities but are overcomplete , contain arbitrary parameters , and , in order to work optimally , require to complexify phase space .",
    "the wigner function , by contrast , provides a parameter - free one - to - one representation of the full density operator but encodes information on quantum coherences as small - scale ( `` sub - planckian '' ) oscillatory fringes @xcite .",
    "they prevent a probability interpretation and pose serious problems for their propagation , pointed out more than 30 years ago by heller @xcite .    owing to these seemingly prohibitive difficulties ,",
    "the semiclassical propagation of wigner functions still awaits being explored in its full potentiality . for a long time",
    ", it has been almost synonymous to a mere classical propagation of phase - space distributions , discarding quantum effects in the time evolution altogether @xcite .",
    "as a first attempt to improve on this so - called classical wigner model , it suggests itself to include higher - order terms in @xmath0 in the quantum analogue of the poisson bracket , the moyal bracket @xcite , upon integrating the evolution equation for the wigner function .",
    "such additive quantum corrections give rise to accordingly modified `` quantum trajectories '' @xcite .",
    "however , they tend to become unstable even for short propagation time @xcite and suffer from other practical and fundamental problems @xcite : as we shall point out below , the very concept of propagating along single deterministic trajectories is inadequate even in the semiclassical regime .",
    "a more convincing alternative has emerged in the context of quantum chaos where semiclassical wigner functions @xcite are appreciated as valuable tools , e.g. , in the study of scars in wavefunctions and of spectral features related to them @xcite . by applying semiclassical approximations directly to the finite - time propagator , expanding the phase instead of the underlying evolution equation ,",
    "an appropriate phase - space propagation method for semiclassical wigner functions has been achieved @xcite .",
    "it features , in a geometrically appealing manner , _ pairs _ of ( real ) classical trajectories and the symplectic area enclosed between them as their classical underpinning  not surprisingly in view of the well - known pairing of paths and diagrams , one forward , one backward in time , as it occurs in the propagation of quantities bilinear in the state vector , particularly the density operator .    while this technique is tailor - made to time - evolve the specific class of semiclassical wigner functions @xcite , semiclassical approximations to the propagator proper , independent of the nature of initial and final states ,",
    "have been constructed @xcite on basis of phase - space path integrals @xcite and of the weyl - transformed van vleck propagator @xcite .",
    "this approach opens the door towards a far broader range of applications .",
    "it has already proven fruitful in an analysis of the spectral form factor of classically chaotic systems in terms of phase - space manifolds @xcite .    here , by difference , we pretend to demonstrate its viability as a practical instrument for the propagation of molecular systems , including in particular numerical simulations .",
    "we therefore focus on its performance in benchmark models established in chemical physics like the morse oscillator and the quartic double well and study standard tasks such as propagating gaussians and computing autocorrelation functions .",
    "we are confident that the remarkable accuracy and robustness of the scheme and its unexpected numerical stability and efficiency suggest it as a new competitive option in semiclassical propagation .    in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] , we introduce the basic building blocks of our method , specify our two main approaches , via the van - vleck propagator and via phase - space path integration , and discuss general properties of the semiclassical wigner propagator , such as its geometrical structure and its asymptotics towards the classical limit and towards weak anharmonicity .",

    ", we found that the notion of propagating along any kind of `` quantum trajectory '' is lacking support . while the deterministic delta function on the classical trajectory that constitutes the liouville propagator is replaced by a smooth quantum spot , no enhancement of this spot on any other deterministic propagation path is observed .",
    "various open ends of this work remain to be explored , of which we mention but a few :    1 .   extending semiclassical wigner propagation to higher dimensions .",
    "it is significantly facilitated by the transparent geometric underpinning and by viable options to adapt it to monte - carlo algorithms .",
