    "the use of photons as quantum information carriers involves the elaboration of effective quantum memory devices which are able to write , store and reconstruct single photon quantum states of the electromagnetic field . a promising approach to optical quantum state storage",
    "uses the interaction of single photons with optically dense media .",
    "the current activities focus on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , stimulated raman absorption @xcite and photon echo @xcite phenomena .",
    "besides , there is a successful experimental demonstration of quantum memory for multi - photon quantum states using off - resonant interaction of light with spin polarized atomic ensembles @xcite . in @xcite a scheme of coherent manipulation of collective atomic states",
    "was developed such that superradiant states of the atomic system can be converted into subradiant ones and vice versa and possible applications of such a scheme for optical quantum - state storage were discussed .",
    "the advantage of the scheme is that storage and retrieval of a single - photon state may in principle be implemented by means of phase modulators only @xcite , i.e. without any additional control fields or pulses acting on the atomic system . on the other hand",
    ", the rate of collective spontaneous emission in this case can be suppressed only for a few collective modes , which means that storage time is limited by incoherent spontaneous emission into other modes . in this paper",
    "the scheme is developed such that total subradiant states , in which spontaneous emission into all directions is suppressed , can be created in an extended atomic system .",
    "such an approach involves using homogeneously broadened absorption lines for storage and retrieval of information in an optically dense medium . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that for high efficiency of such a quantum memory the time shape of a single photon wave packet to be stored should be equal to the time - reversed response function of the optically dense medium .",
    "then the shape of the emitted photon proves to be a time - reversed replica of the initial one . in the present paper",
    "this statement is discussed quantitatively and it is shown that such pulses are optimal in the context of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "it should be noted here that the connection between optimal photon storage and time reversal has been made in @xcite in considering storage on inhomogeneously broadened transitions .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of the question was presented recently in @xcite , where optimal pulse shapes were derived providing the maximum efficiency for different approaches to pulse storage .",
    "the results obtained here do not contradict those presented in @xcite , which will be discussed below in detail , but involve another point of view , namely the maximization of signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "besides , instead of a general iteration procedure which was used by authors of these papers we use a more direct approach to the problem , where the main features of the proposed scheme are explicitly taken into account : the absence of a control field , homogeneous broadening of an absorption line and forward retrieval .",
    "our approach is based on the theory of matched filters @xcite , which allows us to write down the explicit expressions for the optimal pulse shape and total efficiency of quantum memory in a straightforward manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a scheme for coherent manipulation of collective atomic states that enables the creation of total subradiant states in an extended atomic system . in sec .",
    "iii , the basic equations describing propagation of single - photon wave - packets in an optically dense atomic medium are introduced and the pulse shape which maximizes signal - to - noise ratio upon read - out is determined .",
    "in addition to the implementation schemes proposed in @xcite we consider here another simple procedure for writing and reconstructing single - photon states of light using subradiant states . consider an extended system of identical three - level atoms forming an optically dense resonant medium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "we assume that the atoms are not moving as , for example , impurities embedded in a solid state material . in this case we may consider them to be distributed regularly in space with an interatomic distance @xmath0 along some axis , say @xmath1 . moreover , since the parity of energy states in such a system is usually indefinite ( due to the low symmetry of impurity sites ) , we suppose that all transitions are dipole allowed .",
    "( color online ) general scheme of quantum memory device based on a three - level extended atomic ensemble , collective states of which are controlled by an external electric field or classical pulses.,width=325 ]    assume that a single - photon wave packet which is resonant to the transition @xmath2 propagates through the medium , which has a phase relaxation time much longer than the duration of the photon . at some moment of time",
    "the probability of finding the medium in the excited state and the field in the vacuum state is maximum and at this moment of time the atomic system can be subjected to a short coherent @xmath3-pulse at the frequency of the transition @xmath4 , which corresponds to the writing of information .",
    "this step is typical of different quantum storage techniques involving a @xmath5-type medium with inhomogeneously broadened transitions @xcite as well as homogeneously broadened ones @xcite .",
    "now , the spatial distribution of phase of the atomic state @xmath6 in the medium that results from the excitation is described by a wave vector @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are wave vectors of the incoming photon and @xmath3-pulse ( writing pulse ) , respectively .",
    "if we put @xmath10 , then the excited states @xmath6 of adjacent atoms along the axis @xmath1 will be opposite in phase , provided that the vector @xmath7 is directed along @xmath1 . consequently , if the wavelength of the transition @xmath11 , @xmath12 , satisfies the condition @xmath13  i.e. , @xmath14 , then at least @xmath15 atoms prove to be located in the volume @xmath16 , forming two equal groups with opposite phases of the state @xmath6 . as a result ,",
    "a subradiant state is created , the rate of spontaneous emission of photons from which is suppressed for all directions . in this state",
    "the quantum storage is possible during times which may be much longer than the state-@xmath6 radiative lifetime of a single atom . in order to read out the information it is necessary to apply a short @xmath3-pulse ( reading pulse ) with the wave vector @xmath17 to the transition @xmath18 .",
    "the signs @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to forward and backward retrieval .",
    "clearly the most promising materials for the creation of the subradiant states are those in which homogeneous linewidth , @xmath21 , of the transition @xmath11 is mainly determined by the spontaneous relaxation of the excited state .",
    "linewidths approaching the limit @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the phase memory time and @xmath24 is the population life - time , can be seen in materials where all other dephasing processes have been minimized , such as in rare - earth - doped @xmath25 @xcite , where a @xmath23 of several ms has been observed .",
    "the difference @xmath26 , corresponding to such dephasing processes , determines the life - time of the subradiant state , which may be an order larger than @xmath24 at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "for example , for the @xmath27 transition in @xmath28 we have @xmath29  ms and @xmath30  ms @xcite , therefore @xmath31  ms .",
    "it should be noted that in such materials at low temperatures the phase memory of the hyperfine transitions , which are usually assumed to be used for storage in a @xmath5-type medium , is limited by the same processes that cause decoherence on the optical transitions , most notably the magnetic interaction with spins in the host material .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the subradiant state life - time is of the order of the hyperfine coherence time . increasing the latter by applying , for example , a static magnetic field to the crystal implies increasing the former to the same extent . on the other hand , the frequency of the transition",
    "@xmath11 may be much larger than @xmath32  mhz typical of hyperfine transitions .",
    "taking the interatomic distance , @xmath33 , we obtain @xmath34 , which corresponds to the frequency @xmath35 .    as for homogeneous absorption lines , the technique of preparing of narrow absorbing peaks on a non - absorbing background , i.e. isolated spectral features corresponding to a group of ions absorbing at a specific frequency , in rare - earth - metal - ion - doped crystals @xcite can be very useful .",
    "such specific structures can be created as follows .",
    "first , spectral pits , i.e. wide frequency intervals within the inhomogeneous absorption profile that are completely empty of all absorption , are created using hole - burning techniques . then narrow peaks of absorption are created by pumping ions absorbing within a narrow spectral interval back into the emptied region .",
    "the peaks can have a width of the order of the homogeneous linewidth , if a laser with a sufficiently narrow linewidth is used for the preparation .",
    "moreover , using two non - collinear laser pulses instead of a single one it is possible to prepare a periodic structure with a necessary spatial period @xmath0 , since the atoms will be pumped mainly within antinodes of the laser field .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the total subradiant states in a macroscopic atomic ensemble can be created in principle by significantly changing the refractive index of the medium .",
    "there are many proposals aimed at the enhancement of refractive index with vanishing absorption based on quantum interference effects which trace back to the works by scully and colleagues ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bearing them in mind we can consider the following procedure .",
    "let the initial value of the refractive index of the host material be enhanced , so that the wavelength @xmath36 satisfies the condition @xmath37 .",
    "then rather than apply a short coherent @xmath3-pulse , we can reduce the refractive index at least by a factor of 6 , so that @xmath36 becomes larger than @xmath38 as in the previous case . as a result",
    ", a total subradiant state is created . by combining both techniques ( applying the @xmath3-pulse and changing the refractive index ) it is possible to lift the restriction @xmath35",
    "the efficiency of the scheme considered above as well as of those considered in @xcite depends strongly on the possibility of full ( at some moment of time ) photon absorption in the medium with a homogeneously broadened resonant transition and subsequent emission of the photon in the same direction .",
    "this is possible only for a specific ( optimal ) time shape of the pulses to be stored .",
    "the optimal pulse shape which leads to the maximum efficiency of quantum storage may be found numerically using an iteration optimization procedure @xcite .",
    "here we consider the pulse shape which leads to the maximum peak value of the retrieved signal , given the energy of the pulse .",
    "such pulses may be referred to as optimal in respect to the signal - to - noise ratio , the criterion generally employed in communications .",
    "it will be shown below that such pulses create almost uniform distribution of atomic excitation in the medium at some moment of time , corresponding to the end of the incoming pulse .",
    "this moment is optimal for application of the short writing @xmath3-pulse creating a subradiant state . on the other hand ,",
    "upon read out the emitted field proves to be the time - reversed replica of the initial field , which is the characteristic feature of the optimization @xcite .",
    "such a regime may be useful , for example , for a long - distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters @xcite , when the qubits are only stored and recalled once before being measured .",
    "assuming , for example , that time - bin qubits are used for carrying the information , each of them should be a superposition of well separated wave packets of the optimal shape , which provides high efficiency and fidelity of quantum memory devices .",
    "the latter characterizes reproducibility of the relative phase and amplitude ratio of time - bin single - photon pulses during storage and retrieval .    in the simplest case , of an additive white noise",
    ", the maximization of the signal - to - noise ratio reduces to that of the amplitude of the output signal at some moment of time , given the energy of the input signal and transfer function of the medium .",
    "although such a procedure is performed usually in the context of classical signals @xcite , it works exactly the same when a single photon should be detected at the output of a memory device .",
    "the only difference is that the amplitude and intensity of classical light are replaced by the photon probability amplitude density and photon probability density , respectively .",
    "a relevant situation may be the detection of single photons amid broadband background light in free - space communication setups @xcite .",
    "the maximization of single - photon probability density at some moment of time means shortening of the single - photon wave packet to be stored and recalled using a given absorbtion line .",
    "this allows one to minimize the time windows which are necessary for the writing and read out of information and consequently to minimize the probability of detection of stray photons instead of information carriers .",
    "the same argument is true in the context of noise due to the dark counts of single - photon detectors .",
    "consider a system of @xmath39 identical two - level atoms , with positions @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and resonance frequency @xmath42 , interacting among themselves and with the external world only through the electromagnetic field .",
    "we are interested in the interaction of the atomic system with a single - photon wave packet . in a one - dimensional light propagation model",
    "it is usually assumed that the excitation volume may be approximated by a cylinder with the cross section @xmath43 and the length @xmath44 , the fresnel number of the excitation volume @xmath45 , a single - photon wave packet propagates in the @xmath46-direction , and the wave front of the packet is planar inside the excitation volume .",
    "let us divide the medium into @xmath47 identical slices of mean position @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the length of each slice @xmath50 is large compared to the wavelength @xmath51 , but small compared to @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that each slice contains a large number @xmath52 of atoms , but has a small optical density @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a resonant absorption coefficient .",
    "therefore , hereafter we assume that slowly time - varying envelopes of the field and atomic probability amplitudes are constant in each slice and consider `` coarse - grained '' functions on coordinate @xmath46 .",
    "besides , we assume that the time of propagation of photon through the system @xmath55 is negligibly short compared to the evolution time of the slowly time - varying envelopes .",
    "let us denote the ground and excited states of @xmath56th atom by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in the interaction picture and rotating - wave approximation , reads @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the atom - field coupling constant , @xmath61 is the atomic transition operator , @xmath62 is the photon annihilation operator in the radiation field mode with the frequency @xmath63 and polarization unit vector @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 is the quantization volume of the radiation field ( we take @xmath66 much larger than the volume of the atomic system ) , @xmath67 is the dipole moment of the atomic transition . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath67 are real .",
    "first , consider the system of a slice of atoms and electromagnetic field .",
    "for each slice with coordinate @xmath68 we can define the following collective atomic operators : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is directed along @xmath46-axis and @xmath71 , and the general form of the state of the system can be written as @xmath72 with normalization condition @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the ground state of the slice s atomic system , @xmath75 is the vacuum state of the radiation field , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "it should be noted that the normalization condition right after eq .",
    "( [ psi_0 ] ) is written for the system consisting of only one slice and the emf .",

    ".    the photon density for the incoming wave packet at the slice reads @xmath80 and for the emitted radiation we have the analogous equation with @xmath81 and @xmath82 replaced by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "then the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) may be written as @xmath85 @xmath86 here @xmath87 is a geometrical factor @xcite , which describes the result of the integration @xmath88 for identical dipole moments oriented perpendicular to the @xmath46-axis , and @xmath89    if we consider the case when @xmath90 and substitute eq .",

    "now we return to the case of an optically dense medium considered as a sequence of optically thin slices , each of them characterized by the impulse - response ( [ ht ] ) or transfer ( [ homega ] ) function . in this case",
    "we can consider the quantity @xmath104 as a probability amplitude density and assume that @xmath105 $ ] .",
