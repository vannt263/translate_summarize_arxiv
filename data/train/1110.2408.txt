    "the discovery of the current acceleration of the universe from the type ia supernova ( snia ) observations @xcite posed one of the most challenging problems in modern cosmology .",
    "this acceleration of the universe is , today , a well established fact that is confirmed by various independent observational data , including snia , cmb radiation , etc .",
    "however , this discovery can be maintained in the context of general relativity ( gr ) by introducing a mysterious kind of energy source called the dark energy ( de ) , that can generate repulsive gravity ( see references @xcite for extensive reviews on de ) .",
    "it is well known that perfect fluids with a constant equation of state ( eos ) parameter lower than @xmath2 are , today , usually considered in the context of de in cosmology , since they can give rise to an accelerating expansion . beside such perfect fluids with constant eos parameter , various scalar field models , which can conveniently be described by an isotropic and time dependent eos parameter , have been studied with an intention of producing kinematics consistent with the observed acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only possible method of studying de",
    ". it can sometimes be useful to use a reverse method , i.e. , one may seek for the solutions of the einstein field equations by introducing some kinematical anstze that are consistent with the observed kinematics of the universe , and may then obtain and investigate the dynamics of the fluid as a possible candidate of the de .",
    "for instance , as an ansatz in the context of latter method , berman s law @xcite for the hubble parameter , that yields constant deceleration parameter ( dp ) , has been widely considered for obtaining accelerating cosmological models explicitly in the framework of spatially homogenous spacetimes after the discovery of the current acceleration of the universe ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent studies on constant dp ) .",
    "the sources with anisotropic stresses have been rarely studied in cosmology until recent years .",
    "this might be because of the expectation that a dominance of an anisotropic stress would give rise to an anisotropic expansion contrary to observations which favor an universe that expands isotropically .",
    "one may see references @xcite for the effects of some known anisotropic stresses ( such as magnetic fields , collisionless relativistic particles , hydrodynamic shear viscosity etc . ) on cosmological evolution .",
    "on the other hand , the recent developments in cosmology increased the interest in anisotropic stresses particularly in the context of de .",
    "studies focusing on de , including those in the framework of spatially homogenous but anisotropic spacetimes , have generally assumed that de yields an isotropic pressure and obeys a simple eos in the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy density , @xmath5 is the isotropic pressure and @xmath6 is the eos parameter , which is not necessarily constant .",
    "however , various discussions @xcite that focused on whether the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite for more successful explanation need a bianchi type morphology rather than robertson - walker ( rw ) type , have promoted the general interest not only in the bianchi type cosmological models but also in the possibility of anisotropic nature of the de .",
    "for instance , recently , campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility that a de component with anisotropic eos could generate an ellipsoidal universe with the correct characteristics to explain the low quadrupole in the cmb fluctuations and proposed that an ellipsoidal universe allowed better matches with the large - scale cmb anisotropy data .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with their more recent study @xcite , where they analyzed the magnitude - redshift data of snia included in the union catalogue by considering bianchi type i spacetime in the presence of a de fluid with anisotropic eos . in this study they concluded that supernova data are compatible with a standard isotropic universe , however a large level of anisotropy , both in the geometry of the universe and in the eos of de , is allowed .",
    "most recently , while this paper is in progress , axelsson et al .",
    "@xcite studied possible imperfect nature of de and the large - angle anomalous features in the cmb by considering the 7-year wmap temperature observations data .",
    "their results also motivate the further investigation on the possible origin and constraints of imperfect source terms including imperfect de fluid in cosmology . following such studies , several cosmological models @xcite",
    "that introduce anisotropic de candidates to break the spatial isotropy of the universe , which is generally believed to be obtained via inflation in the early universe , have been proposed . on the other hand ,",
    "even if it turns out that , in the future , the rw spacetimes are exactly consistent with the observational data , this does not necessarily rule out the possible anisotropic nature of the de .",
    "the reason being that anisotropic energy sources do not necessarily promote anisotropy in the expansion , and sometimes can even support isotropization @xcite .",
    "maximal spatial symmetry of the rw metrics does not allow the theoretical study of cosmological models containing anisotropic fluids as long as fluids are comoving .",
    "we indeed do not expect the fluids to have bulk motion at cosmological scales , and therefore we must take the spatially anisotropic spacetimes into account to be able to study cosmological anisotropic energy - momentum sources such as magnetic field , cosmic strings , as well as hypothetical fluids considered in the context of de . in the context of the latter method we mentioned above , one may allow the fluid to be general as much as the metric allows and then seek for the solutions by introducing kinematical anstze for the evolution of the universe rather than constraining the fluid from the beginning , for instance , by assuming that the fluid is isotropic . to obtain explicit cosmological models in gr , we do not have a general metric for spatially homogenous but anisotropic spacetime . instead , we have nine of the bianchi type metrics plus kanstowski - sach metric that form the complete class of spatially homogenous but not necessarily isotropic four - dimensional spacetimes @xcite .",
    "hence , choosing one of these ten metrics as the geometry of the universe gives opportunity to generalize the perfect fluid representation of the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) .",
    "however , the symmetry properties of the chosen metric would still constrain emts that are allowed . therefore , it is important to study cosmological models within the framework of different types of spatially anisotropic spacetimes , for a better understanding of the possibly anisotropic nature of the de and its effects on the evolution of the universe . exact general relativistic cosmological models in the presence of anisotropic fluid , in the context of de , using kinematical anstze have been studied in the framework of the following metrics : bianchi i @xcite , bianchi @xmath7 @xcite , bianchi iii @xcite , bianchi v @xcite , kantowski - sachs @xcite , bianchi vi @xcite and locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi type ii @xcite .",
    "such models have also been studied in @xmath8 theory of gravity instead of gr within the framework of bianchi @xmath7 @xcite and bianchi iii @xcite metrics .    in this paper , we present general relativistic cosmological models within the framework of spatially homogeneous but totally anisotropic and non - flat bianchi type ii spacetime in the presence of two fluids , which are the minimally interacting perfect fluid that can be described by an isotropic and constant eos parameter , and the dynamically anisotropic hypothetical fluid as the de fluid .",
    "we make use of two kinematical anstze at the same time , to fully determine the einstein s field equations . as the first kinematical ansatz",
    ", we consider the generalized berman s law @xcite for the hubble parameter , that yields constant mean dp and whose negative values generate accelerating volumetric expansion .",
    "a similar procedure was carried out by singh and kumar @xcite , within the framework of lrs bianchi ii spacetime , in the presence of a single isotropic fluid with a constant eos parameter . in a recent paper ,",
    "naidu et al .",
    "@xcite have studied an lrs bianchi type ii de model in a scalar tensor theory with generalized berman s law and variable eos parameter of de .",
    "we would also like to note that although the constant dp is not capable of representing the whole or a long period of history of the universe at once , it can still be considered as an approximation for representing a particular period of the history of the universe , for instance , the vicinity of the present time of the universe . as the second kinematical ansatz , we consider the assumption first introduced by bali and jain @xcite , that assumes one of the component of the shear tensor to be proportional to the mean hubble parameter .",
    "we assume that the gr is valid at cosmological scales and consider einstein s field equations @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the einstein tensor , @xmath11 is the newton s gravitational constant , @xmath12 is the speed of light in the vacuum , @xmath13 is the ricci tensor , @xmath14 is the ricci scalar , @xmath15 is the unit four - tensor and @xmath16 is the overall emt that describes the physical ingredients of the universe .",
    "we consider the spatially homogeneous but totally anisotropic and non - flat bianchi type spacetime in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the scale factors and functions of @xmath21 only .",
    "@xmath22 is a constant with dimension @xmath23 .",
    "choosing @xmath24 one gets bianchi type i metric . for studying within the framework of bianchi type ii metric , which we are interested here in this paper , it is usual to choose @xmath25 . we also , for convenience , switch to natural units @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the overall emt @xmath16 consists of two different components ; @xmath28 that shall represent the matter fluids ( dust , radiation etc . )",
    "including cold dark matter ( cdm ) and @xmath29 that shall represent the hypothetical fluid we consider in the context of de , i.e. , @xmath30 we do not expect the fluids to have bulk motion on cosmological scales , hence we assume that the fluids are comoving , i.e. , fluids four - velocities are @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "most of the cosmological matter fluids possess isotropic pressure and can be represented by a constant eos parameter .",
    "hence , the emt that represents matter fluid can be written as @xmath33\\nonumber\\\\                     & = & \\text{diag}\\;[-1,\\omega^{({\\rm{m}})},\\omega^{({\\rm{m}})},\\omega^{({\\rm{m}})}]\\rho^{({\\rm{m}})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the energy density , @xmath35 is the isotropic pressure and @xmath36 is the eos parameter of the matter fluid .",
    "however , the nature of the de is still mysterious and we have neither _ a priori _ nor observational reasons for confining ourselves to assume de yields isotropic pressure . because the fluids are co - moving ,",
    "one may get de that yields an anisotropic pressure by assuming that the pressure of the de is proportional to its energy density and subsequently the eos of the de fluid is direction - dependent .",
    "hence we represent the emt of the de fluid as follows : @xmath37\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\text{diag}\\;[-1,w^{({\\rm{de}})}_{x},w^{({\\rm{de}})}_{y},w^{({\\rm{de}})}_{z}]\\rho^{({\\rm{de}})}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\text{diag}\\;[-1,\\omega^{({\\rm{de}})}+\\delta,\\omega^{({\\rm{de}})}+\\gamma,\\omega^{({\\rm{de}})}]\\rho^{({\\rm{de}})},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the energy density and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the directional pressures and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the directional eos parameters of the de fluid respectively along the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes . in the third line we parametrize the second line by introducing the skewness parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 that determine the deviations of the eos parameters of the de fluid on the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes from the one on the @xmath47 axis .",
    "further , because the observations do not rule out the possibility of a dynamical and anisotropic de , we allow all the parameters relevant to de fluid to be time - dependent .    in the presence of the emts given in ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , einstein s field equations ( [ eq1a ] ) corresponding to the metric ( [ eq1 ] ) lead to the following set of linearly independent differential equations : @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    where an overdot denotes @xmath55 .",
    "we have a system of five linearly independent equations - involving eight unknown variables , namely , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 , @xmath56 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in order to fully determine the system , we need three constraining equations . to do that , we shall make one assumption on the physical ingredients of the universe and two assumptions on the kinematics of the universe . before doing so",
    ", we need to define some kinematical parameters of importance in cosmology .",
    "the directional hubble parameters , which express the expansion rates of the universe respectively along the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 axes , can be defined as follows : @xmath57 the mean hubble parameter , which expresses the volumetric expansion rate of the universe , can be given as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the volume scale factor of the universe .",
    "the dimensionless mean dp @xmath60 , which tells whether the universe exhibits accelerating volumetric expansion or not , is another important kinematical quantity and can be defined as @xmath61 the universe exhibits accelerating volumetric expansion if @xmath62 , decelerating volumetric expansion if @xmath63 , and exhibits constant - rate volumetric expansion if @xmath64 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter of the expansion @xmath65 is crucial when deciding whether the models approach isotropy or not and can be defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath68 is the shear tensor ) is the shear scalar .",
    "@xmath65 is the measure of the deviation from isotropic expansion , such that the universe expands isotropically if @xmath69 .",
    "considering the kinematics of the models , we say that the model eventually approaches isotropy continuously if i ) @xmath70 and ii ) @xmath71 as @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "however , considering the physical ingredient of the models , we also expect the energy densities of the each fluids to be positive as @xmath72 for a more realistic approach .",
    "our first constraint is on the physical ingredients of the universe . in gr",
    ", twice - contracted bianchi identity tells that the overall emt is conserved , i.e. , @xmath73 ; @xmath74 regarding the constraint on the physical ingredients of the universe , it is quite reasonable to assume that the fluids are minimally interacting , i.e. , the emts of the two fluids are conserved separately , as done by the authors of ref .",
    "hence , for the matter fluid we have @xmath75 which also trivially gives @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a positive constant of integration .",
    "similarly , from the conservation law for the emt of the de fluid we have @xmath78 which can not be solved for @xmath38 trivially as can be done for the matter fluid above .    for the second constraint ( the first kinematical constraint )",
    ", we consider bianchi spacetime generalization of berman s special law @xcite of variation for the mean hubble parameter that yields a constant value of mean dp : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constants .",
    "this law has been widely used for obtaining exact cosmological models in the context of anisotropic de .",
    "this law gives us opportunity to study two kinds of volumetric expansion laws . from equations ( [ hubbledef ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are constants of integration .",
    "thus , the law ( [ eq14 ] ) provides the power - law ( [ eq16 ] ) and the exponential - law ( [ eq17 ] ) of volumetric expansions of the universe .",
    "one may check that @xmath86 , hence the models for @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 can be considered in the context of de . in this paper , we are particularly interested in the accelerating models in the context of de , hence relatively later times of the universe rather than the early universe .",
    "therefore , for convenience , we shall only discuss accelerating models and the relatively late time behavior of the universe in detail .",
    "recent observations suggest that today @xmath89 ( e.g. , see references @xcite ) , hence , assuming that the dp changes slowly , particularly the model for @xmath90 would represent the universe in the vicinity of present time .",
    "the exponential model ( @xmath91 ) , on the other hand , would also represent the very late universe .    as the third constraint ( the second kinematical constraint ) to close the system , we assume that the component @xmath92 of the shear tensor @xmath93 is proportional to the mean hubble parameter @xmath94 , following the study of bali and jain @xcite .",
    "this constraint leads to the following relation between the scale factors : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant .    introducing the three constraint equations ,",
    "one can now obtain the exact solutions by starting with obtaining the scale factor @xmath18 on the @xmath45 axis explicitly by using ( [ eq12 ] ) and the definition of the mean hubble parameter ( [ hubbledef ] ) with ( [ eq16 ] ) for the power - law solution and with ( [ eq17 ] ) for the exponential - law solution . integrating equation ( [ eq7a ] ) two times",
    ", we obtain the scale factor @xmath19 on the @xmath46 axis in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath97 as @xmath98,\\ ] ] where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are constants of integration .",
    "finally , one can obtain the scale factor @xmath20 on the @xmath47 axis by using @xmath18 and @xmath19 in ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "after obtaining all of the scale factors explicitly , one can obtain all other parameters by using the explicit functions of the scale factors and the energy density of the matter fluid ( [ 14a ] ) in equations ( [ eq7])-([eq10 ] ) .",
    "however , before proceeding to obtain the complete exact solutions , here , we would like to discuss two immediate findings .",
    "first , we would like to emphasize an important point that arises from the second kinematical ansatz , which gives ( [ eq12 ] ) , and the condition for approaching isotropy continuously . using the second kinematical ansatz ( [ eq12 ] ) we obtain @xmath101 the condition for approaching isotropy",
    "continuously imply that all the directional hubble parameters must evolve to an identical value as @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath102 at @xmath103 .",
    "one may check from ( [ eqh12 ] ) that @xmath102 can be possible only if @xmath104 .",
    "hence , if @xmath105 one can not obtain a model that can approach isotropy continuously , but a model that approaches isotropy only for a certain period of time and a model that recedes from isotropy continuously .",
    "however , we also note that @xmath104 is the necessary but still insufficient condition for approaching isotropy continuously . in other words ,",
    "choosing @xmath104 does still not assure approaching to isotropy continuously but provides the possibility , i.e. , if @xmath104 , one still needs to make further analyses of the anisotropy parameter of the expansion whether it can satisfy or can not satisfy the conditions for approaching isotropy continuously .",
    "second , we would like to notice a relation between the bii metric and the anisotropy of the de fluid .",
    "one can observe that , from ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq7a ] ) the skewness parameters of the eos along the @xmath45 and @xmath46 axes should be equal ; i.e. , @xmath106 this shows that bianchi type ii spacetime ( [ eq1 ] ) does not allow the pressures of the de fluid to be different along @xmath45 and @xmath46 directions as long as the shear stress of the overall emt is null ( i.e. , as long as @xmath107 , which gives @xmath108 ( [ eq7a ] ) ) .",
    "this is a result similar to the one discussed in a recent paper @xcite by saha .",
    "hence , although the metric we consider is totally anisotropic , the anisotropy of the de is constrained to be axially symmetric , as long as the overall emt possesses zero shear stress .",
    "using the equations ( [ eq16 ] ) , ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) , we obtain the directional scale factors as follows : @xmath109 @xmath110 } \\;,\\ ] ] @xmath111 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath112 and @xmath113 . in the special case @xmath114 ,",

    "the initial time of the universe is @xmath131 , which can be shifted to @xmath132 by choosing @xmath133 . because this study is in the context of de",
    ", we can conveniently consider only relatively later times of the universe rather than early universe in our discussion about the results .",
    "we have already discussed that @xmath104 is the necessary but insufficient condition for approaching isotropy continuously and one may , here , check that this model satisfies all the conditions for approaching isotropy continuously provided that @xmath104 and @xmath134 at the same time .",
    "in other words , the accelerating models for @xmath104 approaches isotropy continuously and also assures the positivity condition for the energy densities of the fluids in the late universe . we may elaborate the late time behavior of the expansion anisotropy @xmath65 .",
    "one may check that the anisotropy of the expansion does not diverge as @xmath72 provided that @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in our proceeding discussion in this section ,",
    "we consider only the cases that satisfy these two conditions at the same time , and for sufficiently later times of the universe ( for instance , today ) we get the following results .",
    "expansion anisotropy converges to a constant value for large @xmath21 values : @xmath136 one may easily observe that as would be expected from an accelerating model with @xmath104 , @xmath137 for large @xmath21 values .",
    "otherwise , @xmath65 converges to a finite non - zero value for large @xmath21 values .",
    "for instance , campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath138 for the present universe from wmap data , which corresponds to @xmath139 in our model .",
    "the behaviors of the energy densities of the fluids also need attention to decide whether our model is realistic or not . obviously for large @xmath21 values ,",
    "the density parameter of the matter fluid is @xmath140 independent of whether the universe exhibits accelerating volumetric expansion or not .",
    "one may observe that , on the other hand , de dominates the matter fluid for large @xmath21 values for accelerating models and its density parameter approximates to the following finite value : @xmath141 hence , the total density parameter also converges to @xmath142 hence , for sufficiently later times of the universe , de energy fluid dominates the matter fluid provided the above mentioned conditions , and in particular case for @xmath104 , we have @xmath143 .",
    "thus , for @xmath104 and @xmath134 , our model predicts a spatially flat and isotropic universe at late times . for a demonstration",

    "the dp of the volumetric expansion is @xmath176 , which leads to @xmath177 that implies the greatest value of hubble s parameter and the fastest rate of expansion for a universe expanding forever .",
    "this is one of the possible futures of our universe .",
    "therefore , the derived model can be utilized to describe the dynamics of the future of the present universe .",
    "so , in what follows , we emphasize upon the late time behavior of the derived model .",
    "one may check that only in the models for @xmath178 , expansion anisotropy @xmath65 does not diverge as @xmath72 but converges to a constant , and the energy density of the fluid we consider in the context of de does not evolve to negative values .    hence , the detailed picture of sufficiently older universe is as follows ; for @xmath178 we obtain @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath181 @xmath182 and for the particular case @xmath104 , we further obtain @xmath183 @xmath184 @xmath185 @xmath186 one may observe that if @xmath104 , as @xmath72 , the expansion anisotropy converges to zero , the energy density of the matter fluid converges to zero , the fluid we consider in the context of de mimics the well known positive cosmological constant ( i.e. , de fluid isotropizes and its energy density takes a positive finite value ) , the total density parameter converges to unity , which means that the universe becomes spatially isotropic and flat .",
    "thus , the model for @xmath104 is well behaved and satisfies all the conditions for approaching isotropy continuously . in short , for @xmath104 our model that exhibits exponential volumetric expansion can evolve to a phase where it is observationally indistinguishable from the well known solution of the einstein field equations in the framework of rw spacetime in the presence of positive cosmological constant , which is also known as de sitter universe and is the future of the universe in the standard @xmath187cdm model .",
    "we obtain cosmological models that can exhibit rich variety of behaviors in the presence of two minimally interacting fluids ( a perfect fluid as the matter fluid and a hypothetical anisotropic fluid in the context of de ) within the framework of spatially homogenous but totally anisotropic and non - flat bianchi type ii spacetime in gr constrained with two kinematical anstze . as the first kinematical ansatz",
    ", we assumed the constant mean dp whose negative values give accelerating volumetric expansion .",
    "although it is incapable of representing the whole or a long period of history of the universe at once , it can still be considered as an approximation for representing a particular period of the universe , for instance , the vicinity of the present time and the very late times of the universe . as the second kinematical ansatz",
    ", we assumed one of the component of the shear tensor is proportional to the mean hubble parameter .",
    "we showed that although the bianchi ii spacetime we considered is totally anisotropic , it admits only an axially symmetric anisotropic pressure of a comoving fluid as long as shear tension does not exist , independently of the anstze we considered .",
    "we also showed that , for the models that exhibit accelerating volumetric expansion ( @xmath134 ) , there are well - behaved cases where the anisotropy of the expansion converges to finite values ( including zero ) and the fluid we consider in the context of de yields positive values for its energy density in the late universe .    in the particular case with @xmath104 among the well - behaved cases , the anisotropy of the expansion converges to zero continuously , the total density parameter converges to unity and the anisotropy of the de converges to zero , which means that our model becomes indistinguishable from a spatially anisotropic and flat universe in the presence of isotropic fluids .",
    "further , in the case for @xmath91 and @xmath188 , the fluid we consider in the context of de mimics the cosmological constant and the universe evolves to the well known de sitter universe .    yielding anisotropic pressure ,",
    "the fluid we consider in the context of de , can produce results that can be produced in the presence of isotropic fluid in accordance with the @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "however , our model gives additional opportunities by being able to allow kinematics that can not be produced in the presence of fluids that yield only isotropic pressure .",
    "there are also well behaved cases where the anisotropy of the expansion and the anisotropy of the fluid do not cease but converge to non - zero finite values in the late universe .",
    "hence , the dominance of such anisotropic de candidates can distort the isotropy of the universe , which is believed to be gained in the inflationary era in the early universe , with required limits and characteristics .",
    "for instance , recently , campanelli et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the possibility that an anisotropic de component could generate an ellipsoidal universe with the correct characteristics to explain the low quadrupole in the cmb fluctuations and proposed that an ellipsoidal universe allowed better matches with the large - scale cmb anisotropy data .",
    "they give @xmath138 for the anisotropy of the expansion of the present universe from wmap data , which corresponds to @xmath139 in our model .",
    "our models where the universe accelerates with an expansion anisotropy that can evolve to a finite value ( including zero ) at late times would be of interest to many readers since it can generate isotropic expansion as would be expected in standard cosmology as well as the non - divergent anisotropic expansion in accordance with the discussions on whether isotropic expansion is good enough to explain cosmological observations or not .",
