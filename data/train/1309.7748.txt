    "a particle can pass by the same collision partner more than once : the pair potential no longer is monotonous .",
    "this is most easily avoided by tuning the chain displacement so that the moving sphere can only interact with one periodic image of the other spheres or by introducing a lifting move of the moving sphere with itself after a displacement of half the box .",
