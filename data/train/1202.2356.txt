    "the energy exchange between a hard binary and star is comparable to the binary orbital energy .",
    "hence , the energy transfer to the star is of the order @xmath20 and the star acquires a large velocity kick , @xmath21 of the order of the orbital velocity of the binary .",
    "we are interested in the cases where @xmath22 is much larger that the star s energy before the interaction .",
    "the velocity of the ejected star @xmath23 is therefore estimated as @xmath24 with @xmath25 simulations of binary - single star encounters suggests a somewhat steeper slope of @xmath26 ( see figure 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "the differential cross section per unit volume of the binary  single star interaction with semi - major axis in the interval @xmath27 is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of binaries per unit volume , @xmath30 is number density of stars and @xmath31 is the differential distribution of semi - major axis of the binaries , which is normalized to unity : @xmath32    let us consider a log constant distribution of the binaries semi - major axis ( so called @xmath33pik s law , with @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ) , representing an empirical distribution of massive binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , for testing purposes , an uniform distribution @xmath36 ; @xmath37 . due to the gravitational focusing , the cross section of encounters with massive binaries is much higher than with low mass stars .",
    "in addition , the ejection velocities from encounters with massive stars are higher .",
    "observationally , massive stars also have a much higher binarity fraction , as well as separation distribution which is biases toward closer binaries ( lower mass stars seem to have a log normal distribution of periods ; @xcite ) .",

    "in addition , all stars are treated as point - masses in these models , i.e. the models are scale - free . in table  [ tab : models ] we present scaling with initial half - mass radius @xmath58 which , together with considered stellar masses , implies scaling of time .",
    "the models were integrated to @xmath59 .",

    "all massive ( @xmath61 ) stars reside in primordial binaries , and we set a lower limit for the primary and the secondary star to @xmath62 and @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "nevertheless , we use results only from the first 2.7 myrs of evolution , such that the ejections from the different clusters could be directly compared .",
    "note that we do not include stellar evolution is our models , as even the most massive stars in our simulation have a longer main sequence lifetime , and therefore stellar evolution does not play a role .",
    "models 016 and 017 are followed for longer timescale ( 35.5 myrs ) , but these are idealized two - mass models , serve to explore the overall dynamical processes and not the overall realistic evolution .",
    "evolution of stellar clusters over longer timescales would be affected by stellar evolution .",
    "in particular supernovae explosions could produced runaways through the bss scenario .",
    "here we focus on the des case and do not explore the longer time evolution in which stellar evolution can play an important role .",
    "initial state of the models 009 and 014 correspond to mass segregated state according to @xcite .",
    "briefly , this setup is based on an empirical finding that mean specific binding energy of stars in numerical models of star clusters tend to a power - law relation to stellar masses .",
    "profiles of initially mass segregated models can not be expressed analytically but , in general , their density increases towards the center .",
    "all models under consideration were assumed to be isolated , i.e. no external tide was considered .",
    "the process under the consideration , i.e. acceleration of stars to velocities @xmath80 is quite rare .",

    "figure  [ fig : vd ] shows the velocity distribution of escaping stars .",
    "we define escapers as those found at least 5 pc away from the host cluster at the end of the simulations , and have been ejected at the first 2.7 ( 35 ) myrs of evolution for models 009 and 014 ( 016 and 017 ) .",
    "the figure shows the velocity distribution compared with the predicted distribution at the high velocity regime ( when taking the overall normalization to be a free parameter ) .",
    "although the analytic derivation does not account for the mass function , we find that the velocity distribution of ejected stars in models 009 and 014 are also consistent with simple analytic formulation , and the slope is determined mainly by the distribution of the semi - major axis of the binaries ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vd ] ) .",
    "the velocity distribution at the lower velocity regime @xmath82 is qualitatively different , and appears to be independent of the distribution of the binary separation .",
    "comparison with a model where no binaries exist show that all the bone - fide runaway stars arise from the existence of binaries in the clusters .",
    "although not the focus of this paper it is interesting to note in passing that stars with velocities in the intermediate velocity range @xmath83 can not be explained by single - single encounters alone ; however , they also do not follow the simple analytic approach described before , but rather appear to follow a shallower distribution which is independent of the binary separation distribution . this may be consistent with the recent results of @xcite who studied runways from massive clusters in this range of velocities .",
    "these may arise from the dynamical interactions with a small number or even single very massive binaries in the cluster ( bullies ) , which dominate the ejection rate and are later on ejected themselves from the clusters .",

    "[ fig : mf ] showing ejection of very massive runway binaries is consistent with this picture .",
    "note , however , that models 016 and 017 did not include massive binaries , which can play the role of bullies. unfortunately , we did not keep data on specific interactions leading to runaway ejections ; we therefore can not directly confirm or refute this scenario for the low velocity regime .",

    "previous studies of dynamically ejected runaway stars suggested their binary fraction to be low relative to the binary fraction of their parent stars in the cluster @xcite .",

    "the simulations results are consistent with theoretical arguments ; in a binary single encounter the binary receives a smaller fraction of the kinetic energy , @xmath93 @xcite , it is therefore typically ejected at considerably lower velocities .",
    "note that encounters where the single star is much more massive than the binary components likely lead to an exchange of the massive components with one of the lower mass binary components , therefore even such encounters would eventually lead to the binary being the most massive component in the encounter , further contributing to its low ejection velocity , compared to the ejection of single stars .",
    "binary - binary encounters may eject a binary to higher velocities , however , these complex encounters may easily disrupt one of the binaries and/or form higher multiplicity systems .",
    "a hard binary can be ejected similar to the ejection of single star by a softer binary , however its typical ejection velocity would be comparable to the orbital velocity of the wide binary , again producing a bias toward low velocity ejections .",
    "the overall binary fraction of runaways decreases significantly with higher ejection velocities ; and effectively no binary was ejected at velocities higher than @xmath94 in the 009 ( 016 ) models ( compare with the ejection velocities of single stars ) .",

    "the total fraction of runaways we find are comparable to , but systematically lower ( @xmath95 ) than those reported by @xcite ; this may result from the limited time of the simulation ; the lifetime of typical o - stars could be 2 - 3 times longer than the simulation time ( which is comparable to the lifetime of the most massive stars in our simulations ) .",
    "obviously , many other simplified assumptions we use affect our theoretical results , and may contribute to the difference .",
    "in particular the binary supernova scenario , which is not studied here would also contribute to the runaways population .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mf ] we present the mass - velocity distribution of the ejected stars .",
    "we see again the trend of more massive stars having higher runaway fraction ( as reflected by the large fraction of massive runaways compared with their fraction in the imf ) ; we note that even the most massive stars are ejected as runaways .",
    "we also find that the velocity distribution of more massive runaways tends towards higher velocities than the lower mass stars , i.e. the fraction of more massive stars increases with ejection velocity .",
    "in fact , we find that @xmath96 @xmath97 % of the runaway o - stars with @xmath98 @xmath99 are more massive than @xmath100 @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ( 3 ) % of the o - stars are with @xmath98 @xmath99 are more massive than @xmath103 ( consistent with finding of very massive runaway stars ; ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "the latter are runaway merger products of two or more less massive stars , since the adopted imf of the clusters upper mass cut - off was 80 @xmath104 .",
    "similar trends are found by @xcite is their simulations of more massive clusters .     the fraction of runaways vs. mass with given ( lower limit ) velocities for model 009 . all stars below @xmath105 are initially single stars , and their runway fraction might be non - realistic . for ob stars",

    "the ejection or the fastest runaways requires the close encounters with binaries , the rate of which are dominated by the most dense clusters ( which are also the most massive ones , typically ) .",
    "therefore , in order to provide a basic estimate of the ejection of the fastest runaways we consider here only the most massive clusters in the galaxy .",
