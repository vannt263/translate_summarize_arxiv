    "the simple yet powerful technique of magnetic feshbach tuning of the atomic interactions@xcite is the quintessential ingredient for a large number of experiments , and it explains the outstanding role the lithium atom has played in the development of the field .    for realizing a degenerate quantum gas , one needs to implement different laser cooling schemes which typically require near - resonant single - frequency light input in the watt range .",
    "the benefits of all - solid - state designs like large output power , high reliability , low maintenance effort and high intrinsic stability are helpful for realizing light sources that will be welcome tools for every ultracold atom experiment .",

    "the development of a number of related laser sources has been published recently@xcite , and the system developed in our group@xcite has proven highly reliable in every - day operation over the period of one year .",
    "however , these sources are currently limited to output powers in the few - hundred - milliwatts regime .",
    "we have identified two major limitations for pushing the nd : yvo@xmath0-shg concept into the multi - watt range , which are the loss introduced by thermal lensing in the gain medium , and the nonlinear conversion efficiency .",
    "therefore , the key ingredients of our novel high - power design are an improved heat management in the nd : yvo@xmath0 , and the implementation of intracavity shg , both of which will be discussed extensively .",
    "furthermore , we carefully specify the important parameters of the laser output and find that it largely satisfies the exigencies of laser cooling .",
    "our source has successfully been used in the implementation of a gray - molasses cooling scheme for atoms , see ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from laser cooling of atoms , more applications in the fields of atomic physics and nonlinear optics are currently limited by the available single - frequency 671-nm power . in atom interferometers , a larger and",
    "thus more homogeneous gaussian beam can increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the large spatial splitting of the atomic wavepackets employing the lightweight lithium species is favorable@xcite , and can even be increased using multi - photon bragg scattering@xcite when high - intensity laser beams are employed .",

    "in addition , the creation and long - distance transmission of entangled photons in the low - dispersion , low - absorption wavelength region of standard silica fibers near 1.3@xmath2 m has recently been proposed .",
    "the scheme uses the output of a sub - threshold optical parametric oscillator in the degenerate regime pumped by a single - frequency 671-nm laser@xcite .",
    "finally , our laser could serve as a low - intensity - noise pump for cr : lisaf lasers@xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section2 we present the optimization of the fundamental laser design . in section3 , we implement intracavity second harmonic generation . in section4 , we report on the course and continuous fine tuning behavior and nonlinear - kerr - lens mode locking , and we conclude in section5 .",

    "convex pump couplers can compensate the thermal lens close to the laser crystal , which has proved very efficient in high - power resonators , see for instance@xcite .",
    "a large part of the output power limitations stems from the additional intracavity elements , such as the faraday rotator .",
    "thus , injection locking of an amplifier consisting of an empty high - power resonator such as presented in  @xcite could deliver tens of watts of single - frequency fundamental light . at these elevated power levels ,",
    "efficient single - pass frequency doubling of 1342-nm radiation has been demonstrated@xcite , the implementation of which considerably relaxes the complexity of multi - cavity designs .",
    "we acknowledge the group of jacques  vigu for dicussions and exchange of material , and carlota  canalias for providing the ppktp . the authors wish to thank franz  sievers for assembly of the lock electronics , and colin  parker , peter  scherpelz and shih - kuang  tung for helpful comments on the manuscript ."

    "<S> we present an all - solid - state laser source emitting up to 2.1w of single - frequency light at 671 nm developed for laser cooling of lithium atoms . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on a diode - pumped , neodymium - doped orthovanadate ( nd : yvo@xmath0 ) ring laser operating at 1342 nm . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of the thermal management in the gain medium results in a maximum multi - frequency output power of 2.5w at the fundamental wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a simple theory for the efficient implementation of intracavity second harmonic generation , and its application to our system allows us to obtain nonlinear conversion efficiencies of up to 88% . </S>",
    "<S> single - mode operation and tuning is established by adding an etalon to the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the second - harmonic wavelength can be tuned over 0.5 nm , and mode - hop - free scanning over more than 6ghz is demonstrated , corresponding to around ten times the laser cavity free spectral range . </S>",
    "<S> the output frequency can be locked with respect to the lithium @xmath1-line transitions for atomic physics applications . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we observe parametric kerr - lens mode - locking when detuning the phase - matching temperature sufficiently far from the optimum value .    </S>",
