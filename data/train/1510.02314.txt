    "study of geodesics has been one of the main tools in the investigation of the physical properties of spacetimes since the very establishment of general relativity  for a general review of both geodesics and electrogeodesics for the reissner - nordstrm as well as other spacetimes , see , for example , the classical book by chandrasekhar @xcite . besides revealing the causal structure of the spacetime , geodesics help us build our intuition about the solution and connect it to the classical newtonian case , if possible",
    ". it may also be possible to interpret parameters appearing in the solution and restrict their ranges based on physically reasonable requirements on the behavior of geodesics .    until this day",
    ", new papers are still appearing on geodesics in kerr @xcite , which is certainly very important for astrophysical applications , or even in schwarzschild @xcite . with the advent of the ads",
    "/ cft conjecture there has been renewed interest in the geodetical structure of spacetimes involving the cosmological constant @xcite . in these cases , there is usually some test - particle motion which is not allowed in the schwarzschild spacetime or the interval of admissible radii extends farther , which is also the case here as we can reach the axis .",
    "the different allowed ranges could perhaps enable us to distinguish between the various solutions through direct observation .",
    "the general method is to find the appropriate effective potential and study its properties and that is also the approach we adopt in the present paper .",
    "the maxwell field possibly present in the spacetime influences test - particle motion in two ways : firstly by deforming the spacetime , which also has an effect on neutral particles ( or even photons @xcite ) , and , secondly , by generating lorentz force acting upon charged particles .",
    "we focus here on the second effect , which was also studied in @xcite in the case of kerr - newmann solution , where there are two different angular frequencies for a circular equatorial orbit of a given radius due to co- and counterrotation of test particles",
    ". papers @xcite and @xcite investigate charged electrogeodesics in reissner - nordstrm with and without the cosmological constant , respectively , but they do not discuss the existence of double frequencies of circular orbits unlike @xcite where the two different solutions are discussed for the pure reissner - nordstrm spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "circular orbits are important in astrophysics where they determine the appearance of accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "it is thus of interest that a spacetime admits orbits of the same radius but different angular velocities . in principle",
    ", the double frequencies could show in observations of plasma orbiting charged sources .    in this paper",
    "we introduce charged test particles to an axially symmetric static spacetime consisting of two black holes of charges equal to their masses to ensure a static equilibrium between their gravitational attraction and electrostatic repulsion .",
    "that is , these are in fact two extremally charged black holes .",
    "this is a special case of the majumdar - papapetrou class of solutions @xcite , which admit point charges with a flat asymptotic region @xcite .",
    "there are two independent scales characterizing the spacetime : it is determined by the masses of the two black holes and their distance but we can always rescale the masses by the distance so there are only two free parameters .",
    "we find static positions of the test particles and compare them both to the geodesic case studied previously @xcite and the classical non - relativistic solution .",
    "we then specifically investigate linear and circular motion of these charged test particles , focussing on analytic solutions while also using numerical approach as required in the study of geodesic deviation .",
    "although the spacetime is not physically realistic due to its extremal charge , it is an interesting exact solution exhibiting axial symmetry .",
    "in fact , with multiple black holes of this kind , one can prescribe any discrete symmetry or even remove it altogether .",
    "perhaps unrealistic but the studied spacetime is still mathematically rewarding since this is an exact solution of einstein - maxwell equations and we can use analytic approach throughout most of our paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ newtonian case ] we review the newtonian case of two charged point masses in static equilibrium and study motion of charged test particles in their field to be able to check and compare our later results . the background field is the classical analog of the extreme reissner - nordstrm di - hole metric , which we introduce in section [ the spacetime ] .",
    "we then investigate static electrogeodesics ( section [ static electrogeodesics ] ) and test particles oscillating along the @xmath0-axis ( section [ oscillation along z ] ) .",
    "in section [ circular electrogeodesics ] we study general circular electrogeodesics to concentrate on the equatorial case in section [ circular electrogeodesics within the equatorial plane ] . in the final section [ deviation of geodesics ]",
    "we briefly look at the stability of geodesics from the point of view of geodesic deviation .",
    "let us start with the newtonian case of two static massive point charges with their gravitational attraction balanced by their electrostatic repulsion and then let us add a charged massive test particle to study its motion .",
    "suppose that the sources of the field have masses @xmath1 and charges @xmath2 ( of the same sign ) chosen in such a way that the particles are in a static equilibrium regardless of their positions .",
    "we have the relation ( in ` cgs ` ) : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is newton s gravitational constant  in the following we use the geometrized units @xmath5 .. the particular choice @xmath6 is required for three or more sources of the field and in gr . ] without loss of generality we choose both charges to be positive and put the particles to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , respectively , using the standard cylindrical coordinate system @xmath11 and @xmath10 in terms of @xmath12 so that @xmath13 . ] .",

    "firstly , the static case @xmath24 with the test particle located anywhere ( we can immediately see from ( [ lagrangian ] ) and ( [ potential ] ) that this is equivalent to a free particle , generally moving along a straight line at a constant velocity ) . additionally , if @xmath25 , we need to solve ( [ z - direction ] ) only to get static points located along the @xmath0-axis at @xmath26 where @xmath27 and the test particle is allowed to have an arbitrary charge - to - mass ratio @xmath18 .",

    "it is of interest that there are also periodic solutions lying entirely within the @xmath0-axis .",
    "these necessarily entail the condition @xmath32 ) outside of the interval @xmath33 $ ] to find out there is only a single turning point in @xmath34 $ ] and a single turning point in @xmath35 $ ] so that no periodic motion is possible there .",
    "] , using which , the equation of motion can be rewritten as @xmath36 integrating the last relation , we find @xmath37 we will not give here the full solution as it leads to a complicated expression involving elliptic integrals and , instead , we will simply find the turning points with @xmath38 : @xmath39 we conclude that , for @xmath40 there are generally periodic orbits with purely axial motion .",
    "it seems that the position of the turning points is independent of the test particle s charge .",
    "however , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is energy per unit mass of the particle .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the relativistic situation . when discussing the newtonian limit of the relativistic solutions , we must bear in mind that the above solutions are only relevant for slow motion and weak fields , i.e. , at distances from both point sources much greater than their masses .",

    "in fact , since the charge - to - mass ratio of the test particle is the same as for the two black holes , this corresponds to an exact solution of the full einstein - maxwell equations apart from the field due to this additional point source itself .",
    "there are , however , additional static solutions , requiring @xmath64 and @xmath65 which means there is a single point @xmath66 on the @xmath0-axis where a test particle can be static .",
    "it can have an arbitrary charge since @xmath18 drops out of the equations .",

    "similarly to the classical case , there are periodic solutions limited to the @xmath0-axis when the equations of motion reduce to the conservation of energy and normalization of the 4-velocity as follows @xmath72 unlike the classical case , the test particle can reach the non - singular points @xmath73 now and cross the horizon .",
    "this , however , does not produce a periodic solution since the particle can never come back .",
    "as in the classical case , we need to discuss the ranges @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] , and @xmath76 separately .",
    "we define @xmath77 and search for the turning points with @xmath78 .",
    "we always have @xmath79 .",

    "therefore , the second bracket has at most one root within @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 has a single extremum here , which is then necessarily a minimum due to the fact it diverges to @xmath89 at @xmath90 .",
    "we thus can not have periodic motion of test particles here .",

    "similarly , the second bracket only has a single local extremum here and thus at most two roots .",
    "we conclude that @xmath88 has at most three local extrema yielding a single possible interval for periodic motion around the middle value . to summarize",
    ", oscillatory @xmath0-motion of test particles is only allowed between the hypersurfaces @xmath96 .",
    "in we give an example of such motion .",

    "this is generally a complicated system so we restrict the situation to black holes of equal masses .",
    "we find that @xmath101 .",
    "the oscillation takes place between the two turning points nearest to the origin .",
    "sums up the two possible cases .",
    ".regions of parameters where we can have @xmath0-axis oscillations for black holes of equal masses , @xmath102 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the limit @xmath103 all the turning points approach @xmath104 where their distance from the singularity is of the same order as the mass of the black holes and , therefore , there is no newtonian limit and we can not compare ( [ relativistic_turning_points ] ) to ( [ classical_turning_points ] ) .",
    "we now assume @xmath105 constant so that the normalization and electrogeodesic equations read @xmath106 equations ( [ eq : kruhcas ] , [ eq : uhelcas ] ) can be easily integrated to yield @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "if we require the bracket in ( [ eq : deudez ] ) to vanish and combine this with ( [ eq : rhocas ] ) , we only get the previous static solution with @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath109 , which results in the following relation @xmath110^{3/2},\\ ] ] which can be inverted ( for @xmath111 , see the next section ) as @xmath112 as in the newtonian case , these orbits only exist for @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , they only admit @xmath114 ( @xmath115 for equality ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 for equality ) . finally , we get the following formulae for @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 since these equations are generally quadratic , we expect up to two solutions for @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( the sign of @xmath118 only describes clockwise or counterclockwise motion ) . however , ( [ eq : kvadr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kvadr2 ] ) become linear for the special case of @xmath121 , yielding @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "this gives a particular set of radii for possible orbits which , interestingly , coincide with the positions of null circular geodesics as discussed in @xcite so we have the same radius with a photon or a charged massive particle ( at different velocities , of course ) .",
    "on the other hand , the general solution of ( [ eq : kvadr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : kvadr2 ] ) reads @xmath124 we conclude that there can be two different values of angular velocity for a given orbital radius since the electrogeodesic equation contains both linear and quadratic terms in  @xmath119 with the linear one stemming from the lorentz force .",
    "this is very different from the case of a neutral test particle and also from the classical newtonian case with a charged particle where in both cases the orbital radius determines a single angular velocity .    in the following discussion",
    "we specialize to trajectories within the equatorial plane .",
    "this fixes @xmath31 but , on the other hand , @xmath125 can be arbitrary and we ultimately have 3 independent parameters .",
    "if , instead , we left the equatorial plane then @xmath125 would be fixed by ( [ orbital radius ] ) but the masses of the two holes would be independent , resulting in 4 parameters which would render the discussion even more complicated without bringing any new type of solutions into the play and we thus only investigate the simpler case of equatorial orbits .",
    "we now investigate the special case of @xmath126 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : kruhprvni ] ) that this is only possible if the two black holes have equal masses , @xmath102 .",
    "the function @xmath49 then simplifies to @xmath127 in this case , the orbital radius , @xmath125 , can be arbitrary as ( [ eq : kruhprvni ] ) is an identity and ( [ orbital radius ] ) does not apply .      in the asymptotically flat region @xmath128 ( the newtonian limit )",
    "we find @xmath129 ^ 2\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and near the axis with @xmath130 ( strong relativistic effects if @xmath131 ) we have @xmath132 ^ 2\\right),\\\\ a^2 \\omega_{\\pm}^2 & \\approx & \\frac{2 \\frac{m}{a } ( 1\\mp q)}{(1 + 2 \\frac{m}{a})^3 } + o\\left(\\left[\\frac{\\rho}{a}\\right]^2\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we require @xmath133 , we only have a single solution with the upper sign in both asymptotic regions .",
    "the leading order of the angular velocity requires @xmath134 and it is consistent with the classical solution ( near the axis we need to assume a weak field with @xmath135 ) .",
    "therefore , asymptotically , a given radius of orbit only corresponds to a single orbital frequency .",
    "this , however , is not the case generally as we will discuss in the following section .",
    "this might have an observable effect for particles orbiting compact charged objects .",
    "it is of interest that this does not occur in the strongest field along the axis but farther outside .",
    "we proceed by discussing the regions where both solutions ( [ eq : kruhb ] ) , ( [ eq : kruhomegapm ] ) exist .",
    "this also occurs in reissner - nordstrm geometry as discussed in @xcite and mentioned in @xcite .",
    "our requirements are that @xmath136 be positive and @xmath137 non - negative .",
    "can be written as @xmath138 and we thus have a stronger condition @xmath139 since @xmath49 and @xmath136 are positive .",
    "the discussion is very complicated since we have 3 independent parameters appearing in our expressions ( after rescaling everything by @xmath12 ) .",
    "for this reason , we just summarize the results in three tables below .",
    "@xmath140    @xmath141    @xmath142    the values used in the tables are defined as follows @xmath143 @xmath144}{\\left(4 a^4 - 4 a^2 \\rho ^2+q^2 \\rho ^4\\right)^2}}.\\ ] ] these are not constants  as opposed to @xmath145but rather functions of @xmath125 , @xmath12 , and possibly @xmath18 ( in fact , we can again rescale everything using @xmath12 as our basic unit ) .",
    "we give below plots of these functions to understand the conditions appearing in the tables .",
    "as all the @xmath145 s diverge for @xmath146 we only get a limited range of admissible radii apart from the second row in . if @xmath147 we get the special case discussed in ( [ eq : special_case_gamma ] , [ eq : special_case_omega ] ) .",
    "the most interesting option is summarized in .",
    "these are the regions in the parameter space where we get both solutions and , therefore , two different frequencies for the same radius of a circular orbit .",
    "this , however , can only occur between @xmath148 and a finite radius given by the last column in .",
    "we thus conclude that we can only get both solutions simultaneously in the vicinity of the axis but not directly upon it .",
    "to examine the stability of circular orbits of neutral test particles and thus , e.g. , the possible existence of accretion disks in this system , we now investigate the geodesic deviation .",
    "we assume equatorial trajectories and study numerically the evolution of a ring of particles centered on the exact circular geodesic .",
    "the general equation of geodesic deviation is @xmath149 with @xmath150 the deviation from the central geodesic . in our case",

    "let us further assume @xmath154 , which means the ring stays within the equatorial plane @xmath31 .",
    "we investigate numerically the deformation of a ring with zero initial velocities in both @xmath55 and @xmath125 directions .",
    "we thus parametrize the initial conditions as @xmath155 which defines a circle in cylindrical coordinates with radius @xmath156 , centered at a distance @xmath125 from the origin along the @xmath125 axis .",
    "the remaining initial deviation values are set to zero . to depict deformations of the ring",
    ", we first transform the resulting deviations to a non - rotating frame @xmath157with the @xmath158 axis along the @xmath125 axis at zero proper time  and then to a co - rotating cartesian frame @xmath159 .",
    "the new deviations are defined as @xmath160 thus , @xmath161 represents locally the @xmath125 direction and @xmath162 the @xmath55 direction at each point along the central geodesic .",
    "+   +    inspecting , we can see that the upper left and upper right orbits are stable while the other two diverge from the original configuration .",
    "this is just a hint at the underlying dynamics and one would need to explore a general perturbation of the geodesics .",
    "it is , however , obvious that there are both stable and unstable trajectories in the present spacetime .",
    "related to this , we remark that the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable for the classical motion in prolate spheroidal coordinates , which however does not translate into the general relativistic situation .",
    "we have investigated paths of charged test - particles in the background field of two extremally charged black holes held in equilibrium by their electromagnetic field .",
    "the spacetime is static and axially symmetric .",
    "we note that some of the trajectories we studied do not admit a newtonian limit since they do not avoid the strong - field regions near the black - hole horizons .",
    "it is of interest that as opposed to the newtonian case , there are regions with two different angular velocities for a single radius of the orbit , which might have observable consequences",
    ". this may be the case for all charged , static , asymptotically flat spacetimes as these approximate the reissner - nordstrm .",
    "however , it may happen that the double - frequency region is empty and one would need to study these cases separately .",
    "it would then be rather interesting to study the same problem in the kerr - newman stationary spacetime .",
    "it is to be seen whether the region of double frequencies would be stable under perturbations or not .",
