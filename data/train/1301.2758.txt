    "+ of course this is only conceptual interpretation of our ( 3 + 1 ) decomposition of schwarzschild metric . in this moment we have to stress that depending on coordinate system we can get different interpretation of gravity in pseudo classical picture .",
    "+ however , above interpretation - the metric and the acceleration formula - are important pieces of information that will be requested in the section [ sec : maxwell ] .",

    "we will show , there is a way to consider gravity through these equations .",
    "we have just shown that in the geroch decomposition for schwarzschild metric we may obtain maxwell - like picture of gravity that might let us to consider gravity as medium that changes the speed of light .",
    "of course , in local coordinate system speed of light is still constant and equal to @xmath62 however in geroch picture we clearly see equivalence between curved spacetime and flat spacetime with refracting index for light equal to @xmath6 .",
    "+ this consideration leads us to the conclusion that after geroch decomposition we can reconsider gravity not only as a spacetime curvature but also as some field @xmath63 .",
    "of course , this picture of gravity we can only get in ( 3 + 1 ) geroch decomposition and equation of motion of this field is dependent on what coordinate system we choose .",
    "+ we have to be aware of this property of the gravity .",
    "if we try to interpret gravity as field we first need to decide what is the metric and in what coordinate system we consider this metric .",
    "in naive picture we can say that :    - metric choose is equivalent to choose of field ( conservation laws ) ,    - choose of coordinate system is equivalent to choose of equation of motion ( dynamic equations ) .",
    "let us suppose , that we would like to get maxwell - like field tensor @xmath64 for gravity expressed with some four - potential @xmath65 as @xmath66 of course , we could take the approach presented in gem @xcite , @xcite or other related approaches @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , we have shown in section [ sec : action ] that scalar field @xmath5 may serve us to describe gravity on flat manifold .",

    "we see the wave that caries energy in terms of general relativity ( 3 + 1 ) decomposition - it affects the metric the way we should expect . in section [ sec : quantum ]",
    "we will show how we might associate above wave with the light wave .",
    "+   + now , we may consider field tensor for maxwell - like gravity .",
    "introduced vector fields yields to field tensor for gravity equal to : @xmath87 above tensor should serve us gravitational field description at least for schwarzschild case .",
    "+   + by analogy to four - current in electromagnetism we may also introduce four - vector : @xmath88 after simple calculations we may express introduced four - current as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the four - vector resembling four - velocity : @xmath91 and @xmath92 would be the density of some gravitational pseudo `` charge '' @xmath93   + in the energy - stress tensor in gr we consider energy density .",

    "therefore , physical interpretation of introduced gravitational four - current @xmath3 might help us to simplify einstein s stress - energy tensor .",

    "+   + we also see here , that starting with four - potential on flat manifold , we may easy switch to the description for curved spacetime .",
    "this possibility comes from our findings in section [ sec : action ] , that flat manifold minimally coupled to the introduced scalar field may be perceived as curved spacetime .",
    "+   + however , we may still come back to the flat spacetime picture and consider lagrangian and equations of motion , looking for more general formula than gr , referring directly to the gravitational field tensor .",
    "at first let us derive lagrangian and hamiltonian for the action related to the scalar field @xmath5 on flat manifold .",
    "+ joining together conclusions ( [ eq : przyspieszgrav ] ) and ( [ gradg ] ) we may write for stationary , killing observer , that his proper acceleration g ( up to c=1 factor ) is equal to the gradient of @xmath5 what in this case yields to : @xmath107 let us see , that it looks like the standard euler - lagrange condition where we have reduced the mass .",
    "+ taking @xmath108 let us define : @xmath109 then , let us define radial move in form of :    * `` @xmath110 '' represents @xmath111 * @xmath112 * @xmath113    considering only radial move we obtain hamiltonian in form of : @xmath114 @xmath115 what - as expected - represents the amount of energy , that stationary killing observer have to have to keep his position against gravity .",
    "+   + as we may see here , gravitational potential in our approach is equivalent to the move against gravitational force .",
    "we have already seen this move for killing observer in ( [ eq : przyspieszgrav ] ) .",
    "further generalization of the lagrangian to the metrics other than schwarzschild would need adding other than radial degrees of freedom . +   + now , let us consider lagrangian and hamiltonian for test body .",

    "+   + we suppose , that this remark might shed new light on time - like zero - dimension parameter that we consider in four - vectors .",

    "as it was shown , the interpretation of our problem will depend not only on metric we choose but also on coordinate system .",
    "this remark is our first condition if we would like to quantize classical field that we present in section [ sec : maxwell ] .",
    "+ up to now it is also not obvious how to choose hamiltonian in a way that will give us equation of motion for operators and produce valid quantum values",

    "+   + therefore potential energy in gravitational field we may consider as the planck limit of the field in presence of the field : @xmath142      considering rotating vector fields as in ( [ rotac ] ) we might suppose that for rotation with `` c '' speed on radius `` r '' with `` t '' period we have : @xmath143 let us calculate planck limits for such situation :    @xmath144    @xmath145    where we have from ( [ eq : rotat ] ) that @xmath146 +   + as we see , considering twisted pair of above we obtain valid approximation for photon energy .",

    "since photons carries energy - we may expect it is truth .",
    "however this equation needs experimental confirmation .",
    "the last thing we would like to know is , if in our picture of the fields we may obtain hamiltonian from which we could get quantum equations that will be easily interpreted by use of the copenhagen @xcite interpretation of wave function .",

    "it requires further investigation but we can propose test of our model for high frequency resonator where we can test interactions between photons that wave functions have planck scales and interact between each other .",
