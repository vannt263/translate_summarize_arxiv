    "density perturbations necessarily include perturbations of the accompanying matter fields ( not shown here ) .    in the quantum version of the theory , the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the annihilation and creation operators , respectively , of the considered type of perturbations , and the @xmath19 is the initial vacuum ( ground ) state of the corresponding time - dependent hamiltonian .",

    "the simplest assumption about the initial stage of cosmological expansion ( i.e. about the initial kick that presumably took place soon after the birth of our universe @xcite ) is that it can be described by a single power - law scale factor @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants , @xmath28 .",

    "the maximum likelihood value of @xmath0 increases as one goes over from 3-year to better quality 7-year data .",
    "the ml value @xmath1 of wmap7 data release is @xmath142 larger than the analogous result @xmath143 obtained from wmap5 data .",
    "the 3- , 2- , and 1-parameter determinations of @xmath0 persistently concentrate somewhere around the mark @xmath144 .",
    "the uncertainties @xmath145 , although still considerable , get smaller as one progresses from 3-year to better quality 7-year data .",
    "the @xmath2 ( no gravitational waves ) hypothesis is under increasing pressure .",
    "for example , the wmap7 1-parameter result , eq.([best - fit-1d ] ) and fig .  [ figureb12 ] , excludes the @xmath2 hypothesis at almost @xmath3 level . to be more precise ,",
    "the @xmath2 point is right on the boundary of the @xmath146 confidence area ( @xmath146 of surface area under the wmap7 curve in fig .",
    "[ figureb12 ] ) surrounding the 1-d ml value @xmath147 .",
    "this is an improvement in comparison with a slightly larger than @xmath77 interval separating @xmath2 from the wmap5 1-d ml value @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the gradual changes in ml values of @xmath0 are small , while uncertainties are still large",
    ". it would not be very surprising if random realizations of noise moved the consecutive 3-year , 5-year , 7-year ml values of @xmath0 in arbitrary order .",
    "nevertheless , we observe the tendency for systematic increase and saturation of @xmath0 alongside with decrease of @xmath145 .",
    "second , our conclusions about @xmath38 .",
    "together with the increase of ml @xmath0 , we observe the tendency for the increase of @xmath38 accompanied by the theoretically expected and understood decrease of @xmath82 ( the contribution of relic gravitational waves becomes larger , while the contribution of density perturbations becomes smaller ) . the ml value @xmath134 derived from the wmap7 data , eq.([best - fit ] ) , is larger than @xmath149 derived from wmap5 data , while the wmap7 value of @xmath82 is somewhat smaller than that of wmap5 @xcite .",
    "the tendency for increase of @xmath38 and decrease of @xmath82 is also illustrated by the 1-parameter distributions in fig .",
    "[ figureb13 ] .",
    "the spectral indices @xmath150 persistently point out to blue primordial spectra , i.e. @xmath151 for density perturbations and @xmath152 for gravitational waves , in the interval of wavelengths responsible for cmb anisotropies at @xmath125 .",
    "the larger values of @xmath153 derived from wmap7 data release enhance the doubt on whether the conventional scalar fields could be the driver of the initial kick , since these can not support @xmath154 in eq.([inscf ] ) and , consequently , @xmath155 in eq.([primsp ] ) .",
    "( since the inflationary theory is capable of predicting virtually anything that one can possibly imagine , there exist of course literature claiming that inflation can predict blue spectra .",
    "but these claims are based on the incorrect ( inflationary ) formula for density perturbations , see @xcite . )",
    "the questions pertaining to the spectral indices are analyzed in some detail in the next section .",
    "having analyzed the 7-year data release , the wmap collaboration concludes that a minimal cosmological model without gravitational waves and with a constant spectral index @xmath38 across the entire interval of considered wavelengths remains a  remarkably good fit \" to ever improving cmb data and other datasets .",
    "the wmap team emphasizes :  we do not detect gravitational waves from inflation with 7-year wmap data , however the upper limits are @xmath156 lower ... \" @xcite , p.11 ;  the 7-year wmap data combined with bao and @xmath157 excludes the scale - invariant spectrum by more than @xmath158 , if we ignore tensor modes ( gravitational waves ) \" @xcite , p.15 ;  we find no evidence for tensor modes ... \" @xcite , p.30 ;  we find no convincing deviations from the minimal model \" @xcite , p.1 , etc .",
    "in contrast , our analysis of wmap3 , wmap5 and wmap7 data leads us in the opposite direction : the improving data make the gw indications stronger .",
    "the major points of tension between the two approaches seem to be the constancy of spectral indices and the continuing use by the wmap team of the inflationary theory in data analysis and interpretation .",
    "we shall start from the discussion of spectral indices .",
    "the constancy of spectral indices is a reasonable assumption , but not a rule .",
    "if the power - law dependence ( [ inscf ] ) is not a good approximation to the gravitational pump field during some interval of time , the constancy of @xmath159 is not a good approximation to the generated primordial spectra ( [ primsp ] ) in the corresponding interval of wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the future measurements of frequency dependence of the spectrum of relic gravitational waves will probably be the best way to infer the  early history of the hubble parameter \" @xcite .",

    "it is reasonable to retain this definition for more complicated spectra .",
    "then , eq.([22 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath175 obviously , in the case of pure power - laws ( [ inscf ] ) we return to the constant spectral index @xmath176 .",
    "equation ( [ ngnu ] ) was derived for the energy density of relatively high - frequency gravitational waves , @xmath177 , which started the adiabatic regime during the radiation - dominated era . in our cmb study",
    "we deal with significantly lower frequencies .",
    "it is more appropriate to speak about wavenumbers @xmath46 rather than frequencies @xmath178 , and about power spectra of metric perturbations @xmath179 rather than energy density @xmath170 .",
    "the @xmath47-dependent spectral index @xmath180 entering primordial spectrum ( [ pspt ] ) is defined as @xmath181 $ ] .",
