    "the physics of star formation is the link between the small - scale  planet formation  and the large - scale  galactic evolution .",
    "many , probably most , stars form in highly clustered environments ( @xcite ) . within the highly complex structure of a molecular cloud , theorists have identified the clump as the object that forms a cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "observational studies have found a range of structures that might correspond to this concept , but the formation of rich clusters seems most clearly associated with particularly dense clumps , identified by strong emission from tracers of dense gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is the third of a series that studies the fragmentation of a dense molecular clump using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) to follow the hydrodynamics , with a focus on the effects of the thermal physics . in paper",
    "i ( @xcite , hereafter mes06 ) , we showed that an isothermal gas will fragment excessively , producing only very low mass stars . in paper ii ( @xcite , hereafter ume10 ) , we included global radiative feedback from the forming stars , assuming that the gas temperature was equal to the dust temperature ; this approximation over - produced high mass stars . in this paper , we calculate the gas temperature separately from the dust temperature .",
    "we use these simulations to address the role of thermal physics in the fragmentation problem , the density distribution around forming stars in a proto - cluster , the evolution of the far - infrared luminosity during formation , with application to the use of far - infrared luminosity as a probe of star formation rate , and the effects of an improved thermal physics on the mass function of forming stars .    in our previous work ( ume10 )",
    "we modeled a clustered star - forming region and showed that dust - gas thermal energetics with source luminosity terms from young stars can heat the gas and prevent fragmentation .",
    "less fragmentation led to the formation of massive stars , which had not been produced in our isothermal simulation ( mes06 ) .",
    "although we were able to form massive stars , we missed a significant fraction of the low - mass stellar population .",
    "we hypothesized in ume10 that by including a more realistic dust - gas thermal energetics algorithm we would increase the number of low - mass stars . including molecular cooling would decrease the temperature of the gas , leading to more fragmentation and more low - mass stars . to test our hypothesis ,",
    "we have implemented the complete heating and cooling algorithm described in @xcite ( hereafter ued09 ) in simulations with similar scales and parameters as the simulations discussed in ume10 .",
    "we discuss our work in the following sections . in ",
    "[ sec : code ] , we discuss our numerical algorithm and our new method of calculating the gas temperature . in  [ sec : sim ] , we discuss the initial conditions and parameters of our simulation .",
    "our results are discussed in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude and summarize the paper in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "our numerical algorithm was described in mes06 and ume10 . it is a standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm ( see @xcite , references therein ) , which simulates the growth of structures in a cubic volume with periodic boundary conditions , representing a small part of a giant molecular cloud .",
    "the code was modified to include particle splitting and sink particles . in the optically - thin regime , the jeans mass decreases with increasing density .",
    "eventually , when the density becomes sufficiently high , the gas becomes optically thick and the jeans mass starts increasing with density .",
    "hence , there is a minimum jeans mass , corresponding to the transition between the two regimes . to properly follow the fragmentation of the cloud , it is essential to resolve that minimum jeans mass .",
    "particle splitting ( see @xcite ; mes06 ) enables us to do this at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "when the gas reaches a certain critical density @xmath0 , the algorithm replaces gas fragments by _ sink particles _ , using the method of @xcite . sink particles ( or sinks ) represent protostellar cores .",
    "they are not allowed to fragment or merge , but they have the ability to grow by accreting surrounding gas particles .",
    "any bound gas particle within its accretion radius , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 for all but one simulation , see table [ tbl : params ] ) , is automatically accreted into the sink .",
    "because @xmath1 is considerably larger than the actual forming star ( likely radius a few to tens of solar radii ) , the evolution of material inside the sink is unknown . for the simulations",
    ", we assume that all the material falling into the sink flows continuously onto the actual stellar core , producing accretion luminosity .",
    "the luminosity resulting from that accretion will heat the surrounding gas . in order to calculate the luminosity from a sink particle , we use the models of @xcite , specifically their table 3 , which include the effect of mass accretion on the luminosity . for objects with masses greater than @xmath3 ,",
    "we use the method described in ume10 to calculate the luminosity .",
    "there is considerable evidence that not all material passing through a radius of @xmath4 winds up in the forming star , so we also consider the effects of the loss of some material in comparing to the mass function (  [ sec : mf ] ) .",
    "we use the same numerical methods described in ume10 to calculate the mass accretion rate onto sinks and the dust temperature . in order to calculate the gas temperature",
    ", we use the method of ued09 .",
    "we give a brief description here .",
    "the dust temperature is determined using the method discussed in ume10 , and in more detail in ued09 .",
    "ued09 used a spherically - symmetric radiative transfer code , dusty @xcite , to calculate the dust temperature distribution around young stellar objects .",
    "using dusty , we created a grid of models with input values of luminosity and density distribution . in the simulations presented in this paper ,",
    "we calculate the luminosity of individual objects based on mass and mass accretion rate using the models of @xcite .",
    "we also determine the density profile around each of the sinks formed in our simulation .",
    "we then use the grid calculated in ued09 to find an analytic fit to the dust temperature distribution around each of the individual sinks .",
    "we approximate the dust / gas distribution around sink particles as spherical .",
    "we calculate the density profile around individual sink particles , as in ume10 , using spherical shells .",
    "we parameterize the density profile with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as the following , @xmath7    the symbol @xmath8 represents the number density of all particles ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we assume a ratio @xmath10 , which corresponds to a mean molecular weight @xmath11 .",
    "the gas density is @xmath12 .",
    "our approximations are complementary to those of most other simulations that include some thermal physics .",
    "we do not include compressional heating during collapse , as does @xcite . we are not doing radiative transfer during the sph calculation , but instead using a pre - computed grid as did @xcite , and we are assuming spherical distributions of material around sinks .",
    "thus , we will miss some of the effects of geometry included in papers that do not assume spherical symmetry ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , we used realistic grain opacities as a function of wavelength ( i.e. , oh5 dust opacities , @xcite , as described in @xcite ) in radiative transfer calculations that include non - isotropic scattering and apply to all relevant optical depths , in contrast to mean opacities and other approximations used by most other simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the gas temperature algorithm ( ude09 ) includes energy transfer between gas and dust via collisions , gas heating by cosmic rays , and molecular cooling .",
    "heating by photoelectric emission from dust grains is not included because the external ultraviolet radiation is strongly attenuated and the clump we are simulating is assumed to reside deep in a larger molecular cloud .",
    "we are not including ultraviolet radiation from the forming stars .",
    "the dust to gas ratio is taken to be 4.86 @xcite , and the grain cross section per baryon is 6.09 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate is 3.0 s@xmath14 and the energy deposited per ionization is 20 ev @xcite .",
    "the fractional abundance of co is taken to be .",
    "the algorithm requires inputs of dust temperature ( discussed in the previous paragraph ) , local velocity dispersion ( @xmath15 ) , column density , and local density .",
    "we use the local density calculated from the density profile [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) ] to be self - consistent with our dust temperature calculation .",
    "the local velocity and the column density are needed in order to calculate the level of radiative trapping in the molecular cooling lines . the local velocity dispersion ( characterized by the doppler @xmath16 parameter )",
    "was assumed to be @xmath17 throughout the calculation .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption based on the values of the velocity field found in ume10 ( see table  [ tbl : lmae ] below ) .",
    "we estimate the column density at a point of interest @xmath18 within our simulation with the following line integral , for every sink @xmath19 present in the simulation at that time : @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the distance from sink @xmath19 to @xmath18 , @xmath22 is the density profile around sink @xmath19 calculated using equation  ( [ eq : n ] ) , @xmath23 indicates that the direction of integration is radial .",
    "hence , we are essentially calculating the column density of gas along a line of length @xmath24 starting at the point of interest and pointing away from the sink .",
    "the sink particle that gives the highest column density at the point of interest is used to calculate the column density and also the local density at that point within the simulation .",
    "the local density is calculated using the density profile of the chosen sink .",
    "the choice of highest column density is made to ensure that we are not calculating the column density from the tail of the distribution around a more distant sink particle ( see ued09 ) .",
    "the limit of integration was set at @xmath24 to agree with the value used in ued09 .    as in ume10",
    ", we impose a minimum temperature @xmath25 to the gas . hence ,",

    "doubling the temperature while keeping @xmath0 fixed increases the minimum jeans mass by a factor of @xmath50 , up to @xmath51 . following the approach used in ume10 , we decided to keep the same resolution for all simulations : 200 particles per jeans mass . as a result , the particle mass and total mass increase by a factor or @xmath50 , and the box size increases by a factor of @xmath52 .",

    "the slower formation of sink particles in run d05 , for which @xmath66 is due to the fact that the dust temperature is usually larger than the gas temperature , and setting the gas temperature to that higher value tends to inhibit the formation of sinks .",

    "there are fewer sinks formed compared to the isothermal simulation i05 , but there are more compared to the simulation with only dust heating d05 .",
    "the distribution of sink particles near the intersection of filaments is similar to what is seen in @xcite .",
    "the sinks form in close proximity . to quantify this , starting with sink  # 2 , every time a sink formed , we calculated the distance to the nearest existing sink .",

    "the large separations seen in figure  [ fig : histo2 ] correspond to sinks that were the first to form in a gas clump that was located away from all other clumps where sinks were already present .",

    "the medians are much smaller than even the projected median separations in nearby clusters of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the median separations in both simulations increased by a factor of 3 or more between @xmath78 and 2.4 , so further evolution may lead to larger mean separations .",
    "in addition , the overall distributions , especially for g10 , do resemble the observations ( e.g. fig . 2 of @xcite ) in having a tail toward large separations .",
    "given that the confusion limit of the observations is about @xmath79 , they would not resolve the very close pairs .",
    "indeed , the peak of the distribution below @xmath80 might be interpreted as binaries and multiple systems .",
    "extragalactic observers employ a relation between total far - infrared luminosity and star formation rate to estimate star formation rates in dusty starbursts @xcite : @xmath81 for convenience , we express this k98 relation as @xmath82 or @xmath83 . a more recent calibration using the imf of @xcite yields a slightly slower sfr , or higher @xmath84 .",

    "however , @xcite noted that the most massive stars , and hence the luminosity , take a considerable time to build up during cluster formation . using an analytical prescription for star formation , they plotted @xmath87 versus time , finding values 1 - 2 orders of magnitude below the extragalactic relation for times less than @xmath88 .",

    "as seen before in table [ tbl : tempstats1 ] and figure [ fig : t2hist ] during the earliest times , the gas temperature is hotter than the dust temperature because of the low - intensity of the radiation field . at high densities ( @xmath170 ) ,",

    "other simulations attempted to address this issue by modifying the equation of state to account for the increase in optical depth in higher density gas .",

    "in more recent work , groups have included various treatments of radiative transfer to more accurately account for the heating effect of the young stars on the gas ( @xcite ; ume10 ) .",
    "inclusion of the heating effect shifts the mass function to higher masses .",
    "figure [ fig : gmf2 ] shows the mass functions of the sink particles at various times in the simulations g05 and g10 . at early times , the mass function is dominated by accreting low - mass objects . as the simulations evolve , these low - mass sinks continue to accrete and become more massive . at later times ,",
    "the formation of low - mass sinks become less frequent because the gas is now hotter and the jeans mass is higher , causing a delay in sink formation until they have reached the new higher jeans mass .",
    "although there is a tendency for the mass function to shift its peak to higher masses with time , the imf in simulation g10 becomes relatively stable after about @xmath186 .",
    "the shift to higher masses relative to the isothermal calculation agrees with the results of the references given above .",

    "the regions around our sinks have density profiles similar to those of gas around class 0 objects discussed in  [ sec : ddpe ] .",

    "the missing mass is likely to be removed in molecular outflows driven by stellar winds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "is only missing a factor of 2 - 3 objects compared to the empirical imf , which is significantly less than the factor of @xmath197 seen in figure [ fig : mfall ] .",
    "however , the adjusted mean and median masses are still higher than in the empirical imfs ( table [ tbl : avgmed ] ) . since we assumed that all the mass of the sink went into the star in order to calculate luminosities , it is not self - consistent to apply the efficiency factor after the calculation .",
    "we do it only to suggest avenues for future exploration .",
    "there are questions about the connection between the core mass function and the stellar mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other effects may decrease the mass of the final stars , including disk fragmentation to form binary or multiple stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation for this work was to explore the effect of dust - gas energetics in a clustered star formation simulation .",

    "the temperature of a simulation which included gas cooling was on average lower than in a simulation with @xmath198 , as expected . with a lower average temperature ,",
    "fragmentation was more prevalent and more objects were able to form .",
    "the average density profile parameters surrounding a sink were similar among the four simulations and agreed with observations of low - mass class  0 sources .",

    "infall speeds and mass accretion rates for high - mass protostars and protostars in clustered environments are poorly constrained .",
    "infall speeds and mass accretion rates are somewhat smaller for g05 and g10 compared to d05 .",

    "measurements of sfr for very young clusters ( ages @xmath201 ) using @xmath96 are very likely underestimated .",
    "we computed the mass evolution of protostars during the simulation , and we compared the mass function at the end of each simulation . in our previous work , ume10 , we found that a non - isothermal , stellar - source dependent energetics algorithm radically reduced the number of young stars that were formed and formed more massive stars , compared to simulations with isothermal gas .",

    "this change increased the number of intermediate mass objects , but the deficiency of low - mass objects persists .",
    "the two main differences between d05 versus g05 and g10 were the temperature distribution and the mass function , which are related to each other . in a lower temperature environment with more sink particles forming ,",
    "there was less material available to be accreted and therefore a smaller fraction of massive objects were formed .",
    "this affected the mass function and led to a slight decrease in the number of high - mass objects and an increase in the amount of low - mass objects when compared to the simulations with dust heating only in ume10 .",
    "we found very little difference in the mass function between g05 and g10 , indicating that the initial temperature is not very important ; feedback from the first protostars rapidly erases the effects of initial temperature .",
    "we performed a thought experiment in which we tried to explain the discrepancy between our mass function and the empirical imf . in our simulation",

    "if we multiply our sink masses by 0.3 , we get better agreement with the imf .",
