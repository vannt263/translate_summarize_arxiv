    "recent observations of the luminosity of type ia supernovae indicate [ 1 , 2 ] an accelerated expansion of the universe and lead to the search for a new type of matter which violate the strong energy condition @xmath1 .",
    "the matter consent responsible for such a condition to be satisfied at a certain stage of evolution of the universe is referred to as _",
    "dark energy_. there are different candidates to play the role of the dark energy .",
    "the type of dark energy represented by a scalar field is often called _ quintessence_. the transition from a universe filled with matter to an exponentially expanding universe does not necessarily require the presence of the scalar field as the only alternative . in particular one can try another alternative by using an exotic type of fluid - the so - called chaplygin gas which obeys an equation of state like @xmath2 [ 3 ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the pressure and energy density and @xmath5 is a positive constant .",
    "subsequently the above equation was modified to the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "this model gives the cosmological evolution from an initial dust like matter to an asymptotic cosmological constant with an epoch that can be seen as a mixture of a cosmological constant and a fluid obeying an equation of state @xmath8 .",
    "this generalized model has been studied previously [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "+ in the paper [ 4 ] , the flat friedmann model filled with chaplygin fluid has been analyzed in terms of the recently proposed `` _ statefinder _ '' parameters [ 6 ] .",
    "in fact trajectories in the @xmath9 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "the statefinder diagnostic along with future snap observations may perhaps be used to discriminate between different dark energy models .",
    "the above statefinder diagnostic pair are constructed from the scale factor @xmath10 and its derivatives upto the third order as follows :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the hubble parameter and the deceleration parameter respectively .",
    "these parameters are dimensionless and allow us to characterize the properties of dark energy in a model independent manner .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 forms the next step in the hierarchy of geometrical cosmological parameters after @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",
    "+ in section ii , all the discussions are valid in general for @xmath16 , but in section iii we have specifically considered the simple case of a spatially flat universe ( @xmath17 ) , which naturally follows from the simplest version of the inflationary scenario and is confirmed by recent cmb experiments [ 7 ] . in our present work",
    "we consider a more general modified chaplygin gas obeying an equation of state [ 8 ]    @xmath18    this equation of state shows radiation era ( when @xmath19 ) at one extreme ( when the scale factor @xmath10 is vanishingly small ) while a @xmath0cdm model at the other extreme ( when the scale factor @xmath10 is infinitely large ) . at all stages it shows a mixture .",
    "also in between there is also one stage when the pressure vanishes and the matter content is equivalent to a pure dust .",
    "we have further described this particular cosmological model from the field theoretical point of view by introducing a scalar field @xmath20 and a self - interacting potential @xmath21 with the effective lagrangian    @xmath22    in the paper of gorini et al [ 4 ] , it has been shown that for the simple flat friedmann model with chaplygin gas can equivalently described in terms of a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field @xmath20 . in this case",
    "frw equations for chaplygin gas fits in barrow s scheme [ 9 ] . following barrow",
    "[ 10 ] , kamenshchik et al [ 3 , 11 ] have obtained homogeneous scalar field @xmath23 and a potential @xmath21 to describe chaplygin cosmology . in the section",
    "ii , we have obtained the corresponding expressions for a modified chaplygin gas as generalization of the previous work .",
    "+ it has been possible to express @xmath21 in terms of the scale factor @xmath10 for arbitrary values of the constant @xmath24 and have explicitly shown how @xmath21 varies as the scale factor interpolates between radiation and @xmath0cdm stages for different values of the constant @xmath25 . in the next stage evolution of the model universe has been studied in the @xmath26 plane for the entire physically realistic history of the universe and compared to that for either pure chaplygin gas model or a generalized chaplygin gas model as given in [ 5 ] .",

    "+ the energy conservation equation is    @xmath32    using equation ( 2 ) we have the solution of @xmath4 as    @xmath33^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "+ due to complicated form of the equation of state ( 2 ) , the scale factor @xmath10 can not be solved from the einstein field equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) for arbitrary @xmath35 .",
    "however for @xmath17 , the solution of scale factor @xmath10 has the form    @xmath36=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(1+a)c^{x}t\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "+ now for small value of scale factor @xmath10 , we have    @xmath39    which is very large and corresponds to the universe dominated by an equation of state @xmath40 .",
    "+ also for large value of scale factor @xmath10 ,    @xmath41    which correspond to an otherwise empty universe with a cosmological constant @xmath42 . + for accelerating universe @xmath15 must be negative i.e. , @xmath43 i.e. , @xmath44    this expression shows that for small value of scale factor we have decelerating universe while for large values of scale factor we have accelerating universe and the transition occurs when the scale factor has the expression @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{3(1+\\alpha)(1+a)}}$ ] .",
    "+ considering now the subleading terms in equation ( 8) at large values of @xmath46 , we can obtain the following expressions for the energy density and pressure :    @xmath47    and @xmath48    equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) describe the mixture of a cosmological constant equal to @xmath42 with a matter whose equation of state is given by    @xmath49    which for a pure chaplygin gas reduces to @xmath8 .",
    "+ now we consider this energy density and pressure corresponding to a scalar field @xmath20 having a self - interacting potential @xmath21 .",
    "the lagrangian of the scalar field has been given in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the analogous energy density @xmath50 and pressure @xmath51 for the scalar field are the following :    @xmath52^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    and @xmath53^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}-b \\left[\\frac{b}{1+a}+\\frac{c}{a^{3(1+a)(1+\\alpha ) } } \\right]^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ] + hence for flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) we have    @xmath54^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}-b \\left[\\frac{b}{1+a}+\\frac{c}{a^{3(1+a)(1+\\alpha ) } } \\right]^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    and @xmath55^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}}+\\frac{1}{2}b \\left[\\frac{b}{1+a}+\\frac{c}{a^{3(1+a)(1+\\alpha ) } } \\right]^{-\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}}\\ ] ]    from equation ( 18 ) we have the relation between scale factor @xmath10 and scalar field @xmath20 as    @xmath56    from equation ( 19 ) we get    @xmath57    @xmath58    since @xmath59 .",
    "so when @xmath60 i.e. , when @xmath61 the situations are completely different for @xmath62 and for @xmath63 . in the second case @xmath64 as @xmath60 , but in the first case @xmath65 as @xmath60 .",
    "this is why we get qualitatively two different pictures in two cases - as reflected in the figures 2 and 5 . in the other limit @xmath66 , @xmath67 for the above two cases .",
    "+ for example , @xmath68 , @xmath69 as @xmath66 +  and  @xmath70 , @xmath71 as @xmath66 .",

    "4 - 6 shows variation of @xmath20 and @xmath72 against @xmath46 and @xmath20 for @xmath63 and @xmath74 .",
    "the graphical representation of @xmath20 against @xmath46 and @xmath21 against @xmath46 and @xmath20 respectively have been shown in figures 1 - 3 for @xmath19 and figures 4 - 6 for @xmath63 . from figures 1 , 4",
    "we have seen that scalar field @xmath20 sharply falls when scale factor @xmath10 increases , both for @xmath19 and @xmath63 . in figure 2",
    ", we see that potential function @xmath21 sharply decreases from extremely large value and thereafter it increases to a fixed value for @xmath19 . on the other hand for @xmath63 , the nature of @xmath21 against @xmath46",
    "is as stated in the following . for small @xmath46",
    ", @xmath21 varies insignificantly from zero value and then increases sharply to a constant value . in figure 3 , @xmath21 decreases slightly and then increases to infinitely large value for @xmath19 while for @xmath63 , in figure 6 , @xmath21 decreases to zero asymptotically starting from a extremely large value .",
    "so @xmath21 demonstrates completely different behaviour for two different values of @xmath63 and @xmath19 .",
    "further the figures show how @xmath21 varies with @xmath20 with different values chosen for @xmath24 .",
    "the statefinder parameters have been defined in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "trajectories in the @xmath26 plane corresponding to different cosmological models , for example @xmath0cdm model diagrams correspond to the fixed point @xmath75 .",
    "+ for friedmann model with flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) ,    @xmath76    and @xmath77    so from equation ( 1 ) we get    @xmath78    thus we get the ratio between @xmath3 and @xmath4 :    @xmath79    for modified chaplygin gas , velocity of sound can be written as    @xmath80    from equations ( 24 ) and ( 25 ) we get the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath81 :    @xmath82    in the @xmath26 plane the above equation has only one asymptote parallel to @xmath81-axis namely , @xmath83 and the asymptote intersects the curve in only one point @xmath84 .",
    "+ figure 7 shows the variation of @xmath81 with the variation of @xmath14 for @xmath19 and for @xmath85 .",
    "the portion of the curve on the positive side of @xmath81 which is physically admissible is only the values of @xmath14 greater than @xmath86 .",
    "the part of the curve between @xmath87 and @xmath88 with positive value of @xmath81 is not admissible ( we have not shown that part in the figure 7 ) because for the chaplygin gas under consideration we face a situation , where the magnitude of the constant @xmath5 becomes negative .",
    "it can be shown in the following way .",
    "+     + fig.7 + fig .",
    "7 shows the variation of @xmath81 against @xmath14 for different values of @xmath24 (=  0.6 ,  1 ) and for @xmath19 .",
    "since we consider the range of @xmath25 as @xmath89 , we immediately get the inequality relation    @xmath90    for all points lying in the part of the curve between @xmath87 and @xmath88 as stated above . in this range",
    "positive values of the parameter @xmath81 is explicitly given by    @xmath91\\ ] ]    the above expression for @xmath81 is obtained by solving equation ( 27 ) .",
    "one must note that the other root containing negative sign before the square root symbol is to be left out since we consider only the positive magnitude of @xmath81 .",
    "+ again from ( 25 ) and ( 2 ) , we get @xmath92 which in view of ( 29 ) leads to the relation    @xmath93    one can show by a simple algebraic exercise that the right hand side of ( 30 ) is clearly negative for all points corresponding to @xmath94 and hence @xmath5 becomes negative , which is unacceptable in view of the chaplygin gas model we are considering .",
    "this upper limit for @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath95 for @xmath19 that is when we choose our universe to be a mixture of radiation and chaplygin gas . +",
    "thus the curve in the positive side of @xmath81 starts from radiation era and goes asymptotically to the dust model .",
    "but the portion in the negative side of @xmath81 represents the evolution from dust state ( @xmath96 ) to the @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus the total curve represents the evolution of the universe starting from the radiation era to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "in this work , we have presented a model for modified chaplygin gas . in this model",
    "we are able to describe the universe from the radiation era ( @xmath19 and @xmath4 is very large ) to @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath4 is small constant ) .",
    "so compare to chaplygin gas model , the present model describe universe to a large extent .",
    "also if we put @xmath98 with @xmath99 , then we can recover the results of the chaplygin gas model . in figure 7 , for @xmath26 diagram the portion of the curve for @xmath100 between @xmath87 to @xmath88 is not describable by the modified chaplygin gas under consideration .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath101 then from the curve @xmath102 which corresponds to @xmath103 and hence we have from the equation of state , @xmath104 which is not valid for the specific chaplygin gas model considered here . at the large value of the scale factor",
    "we must have some stage where the pressure becomes negative and hence @xmath5 has to be chosen positive .",
    "it follows therefore that a portion of the curve as mentioned above should not remain valid .",
