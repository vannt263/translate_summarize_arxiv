    "organic materials play a crucial role among next - generation iot products , such as display , battery and sensor , since they form flexible atomic structures and enable ultra - thin , light , flexible ( wearable ) devices with a low fabrication cost .",
    "the atomic structure of organic device materials is disordered and the simulation of such materials requires 100-nanometer - scale systems , which is beyond the computational limit of the present standard electronic structure calculations .",
    "recently , electronic structure calculations with one - hundred - million atoms were realized on the k computer by our electronic structure calculation code elses ( = extra large scale electronic structure calculation ; http://www.elses.jp/ ) .",
    "@xcite the theory is based on generalized shifted linear equations @xmath1 , instead of the conventional generalized eigenvalue equation @xmath2 .",
    "the computational cost is order-@xmath0 ( @xmath3 ) or proportional to the number of atoms @xmath0 .",
    "the method is extremely suitable to parallelism and the benchmark on the k computer shows the efficient parallel computation in the strong scaling with up to the full system ( 663,552 cores ) for one - hundred - million atoms ( 100nm - scale ) materials . since the fundamental methodologies are purely mathematical , they are applicable to various materials such as semiconductors and metals .",
    "the code was developed for years , by some of the authors ( t. hoshi and h. imachi ) and their co - workers , particularly for academic - industrial collaboration researches .",
    "a recent collaboration research is one for organic device materials ( refs .",

    "the other application researches can be found in the reference lists of the above papers . as technical details ,",
    "the code uses _ ab initio_-based model ( tight - binding ) theory and ,",
    "optionally , finer methodologies of charge - self - consistent theory and van der waals force .",
    "a parallel direct solver the generalized eigenvalue equation was also implemented in our code .",
    "@xcite the direct solvers are complement to the order-@xmath0 solvers , because the direct solver gives numerically exact calculations with a heavier @xmath4 operation cost .",
    "the present paper reports several preliminary results for the calculation of organic materials by elses in quantum molecular dynamics simulations and transport ( wavepacket dynamics ) simulations .",
    "quantum molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for condensed organic polymers . the order-@xmath0 method was used .",

    "figure [ fig - wpd](a ) shows a @xmath12 wavefunctions in an organic polymer , poly-((9,9)-dioctyl fluorene ) with @xmath13 .",
    "both ballistic and non - ballistic conduction mechanisms are important . in a fairly disordered sample , for example ,",
    "@xmath12 wavefunctions are so localized that they are hard to propagate and the sample will show a smaller value of mobility . the simulation is based on a schrdinger - type equation ( @xmath14 ) for a hole wavepacket @xmath15 with a modelled hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "the time interval of simulation step is typically , @xmath17fs and is much smaller than that in the molecular dynamics simulation ( @xmath18 ) . in a previous paper , @xcite a wp dynamics simulation",
    "was carried out for organic polymers , in which a @xmath12-orbital - only model is constructed for disordered atomic structures in dynamical simulations .",
    "the analysis of the result gives mobility .",
    "the present method is a theoretical generalization of the previous one @xcite .",
    "methodological details have not yet settled and a brief outline is explained here . the initial wavepacket @xmath19 for a hole is set as an eigenstate , such as the homo state .",
    "now we are constructing two kinds of dynamical simulation methods ; the one is the combined simulation between molecular dynamics and wavepacket dynamics simulations , or the explicit dynamical simulation of atoms and the wavepacket .",
    "the other is the wavepacket dynamics simulation in which the atomic motion is treated as a modeled perturbed term in the wavepacket dynamics .",
    "the latter method gives a faster simulation .",
    "since our purpose is the systematic survey among different samples the problem is the balance between the computational cost and the accuracy .",
    "if the simulation runs faster , we can investigate a dynamics in a larger time scale or many sample in different structures and/or conditions .",
