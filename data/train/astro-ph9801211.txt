    "radio samples offer one of the best possibilities at the moment for searching for high redshift quasars and obtaining complete samples of quasars that are free of optical selection effects .",
    "radio surveys cover vast areas of sky , providing thousands of candidates with accurate positions .",
    "if these are flat - spectrum sources , the probability that they are quasars is very high and the selection effects relatively simple and well understood . in particular , there is no bias against high redshift quasars , at least out to @xmath3 . + in 1992 we initiated a study aimed at the complete identification of a sample of flat - spectrum radio sources from the parkes catalogue .",
    "the sample was comprised of all sources from the catalogue with spectral indices between 11 and 6 cm flatter than -0.4 , in the declination range + 2.5@xmath4 to -80@xmath4 ( excluding low galactic latitudes ( @xmath5 ) and regions around the magellanic clouds . of these 878 sources ,",
    "only 229 were listed in the catalogue as unidentified . for these we obtained accurate radio positions using new vla and australia telescope measurements and previously published and unpublished measurements .",
    "these sources were then identified , either from cross - correlation with the cosmos catalogue of the southern sky ( based on the uk schmidt j survey with a limiting magnitude of @xmath6 22.0 - 22.5 ) , or from ccd observations made with the eso 3.6 m telescope on la silla .",
    "we now have a completely identified sample of 878 sources , with no optical magnitude limit or selection effects .",
    "in addition , we have obtained complete spectroscopic data on a sub - sample of 442 stellar identifications - quasars and bl lacs .",
    "+ this sample can be used for a variety of purposes .",
    "our primary objective was to search for @xmath7 quasars , and test the reality of the apparent redshift cutoff ( shaver _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996a ) .",
    "it also becomes possible to map out the entire `` quasar epoch '' with one single sample , free of the complications of optical selection effects , to study the radio and optical luminosity functions as a function of redshift , and to set limits on the obscuration of the distant universe by dust .",
    "it can be used for unbiased searches for damped ly@xmath2 systems , studies of `` red quasars '' , and candidates for molecular absorption systems .",
    "we briefly describe some of these aspects below .",
    "full accounts of this work will be published in a series of three papers ( shaver _ et al . , _",
    "1998 ; jackson _ et al . , _ 1998 ; hook _ et al . , _ 1998 ) .",
    "it was already becoming apparent in the late 1960s that the rapid increase in the number of quasars with redshift did not continue beyond @xmath8 . indeed",
    ", several authors suggested that there could be a redshift cutoff  a real decrease in the space density of quasars which was not merely due to observational selection effects .",
    "sandage ( 1972 ) wrote _ `` the possibility that we have already seen to the edge of the world is quite remarkable . to prove that we have would be quite unique . ''",
    "_ over the ensuing years , however , the reality of a redshift cutoff has been difficult to establish with certainty .",
    "+ given their great luminosities , quasars could easily be seen out to very high redshifts ( @xmath9 ) , if they are there .",
    "any search should ideally be open to the highest possible redshifts , and not limited by the search technique .",
    "a radio - based search is the obvious choice at present . not only",
    "is it free of the selection effects which limit optical searches , it is also free of any obscuration by dust .",
    "+ we therefore used our large complete sample to search for high redshift quasars .",
    "quasars at very high redshifts ( @xmath7 ) can be distinguished by the fact that they should be heavily obscured in the optical @xmath10 band by intervening hydrogen , because the lyman limit is redshifted past this band , and they will only be detectable at very red wavelengths .",
    "thus , our strategy was to look for extremely red stellar objects at the positions of our flat - spectrum radio sources .",
    "+ there were two critical assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) very high - redshift quasars will still have flat spectra between the observed wavelengths 11 and 6 cm .",
    "however , spectra which are flat at the usual centimeter wavelengths often become steeper at shorter wavelengths , and at sufficiently high redshifts this steep portion of the spectrum will be redshifted into the window between 11 and 6 cm where the sample is selected , so that very high - redshift quasars could be excluded in the selection process .",
    "examination of the quasi - simultaneous radio spectra of a sample of quasars and bl lac objects measured by gear _",
    "et al . , _ ( 1994 ) indicates that this effect only becomes important above @xmath11 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath7 quasars will be obscured in the optical @xmath10 band .",
    "this is justified on the basis of observed quasar spectra at redshifts up to 5 ( storrie - lombardi _ et al . , _",
    "1996 ) and extrapolations of the statistics of intervening hydrogen absorbers to higher redshifts ( mller ( private communication ) ; mller & warren , 1991 ) .",
    "10 magnitudes of extinction is typical in the @xmath10-band , even at @xmath12 .",
    "+ all of the sources in this sample have been optically identified , either as galaxies or as stellar objects which are present in the @xmath10-band . in neither case",
    "can they be quasars at @xmath7 .",
    "the only source that came close was pks 1251 - 407 , identified with a very red stellar object , although because it was still faintly visible in @xmath10 it was not considered a @xmath7 candidate .",
    "indeed , it was found to have a redshift of 4.46 , making it the highest - redshift radio - loud quasar known at the time ( shaver _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996b ) .",
    "objects at higher redshifts could have been found with similar ease .",
    "thus , as all sources are identified , there are simply none left which could be quasars at @xmath7 . +",
    "this enables us to place an upper limit on the space density of flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars at @xmath7 _ which is independent of optical magnitude_. we consider only those areas which were completely surveyed down to 0.25 jy at 11 cm .",
    "the absence of any quasars in the comoving volume covered by this 3.8 steradian area and the redshift range @xmath13 can be directly compared with measured space densities in lower redshift bins of quasars with radio luminosities @xmath14 10@xmath15 w hz@xmath16 sr@xmath16 corresponding to the flux limit at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 = 50 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 and @xmath19 = 0.5 are used throughout this paper ) . as we can use only sources with known redshifts in the lower redshift bins , some ( _ eg . _ bl lacs )",
    "are excluded , so the space densities we compute at @xmath20 are _ lower _ limits , to be compared with the _ upper _ limit at @xmath7 .",
    "+ this upper limit , normalized to the space densities found at @xmath21 , is marked at @xmath22 in fig .",
    "the pronounced decrease at high redshift is obvious ; considering that 25 quasars above @xmath23 are found at @xmath20 and none at @xmath24 , the turnover is significant at the 99.96% level ( 99.98% when we use our entire sample , including zones of the parkes catalogue complete to 0.20 and 0.65 jy ) .",
    "if there were no fall - off in the space density of quasars at high redshift , we would expect to find at least 15 quasars at @xmath24 in our sample . +",
    "this absence of high - redshift quasars in our sample is very unlikely to be due to obscuration :    1 .",
    "radio emission is unaffected by dust , and all sources are already accounted for - there are simply none left to be @xmath7 quasars .",
    "this excludes the possibility of obscuration by intervening galaxies or dusty lyman limit systems too faint to be seen directly .",
    "the possibility that some of the sources are in fact at @xmath7 but have been _ misidentified _ with visible foreground galaxies that obscure them can not explain the turnover , because it would require accurate positional coincidences of _ all _ of the @xmath7 quasars with observed foreground galaxies .",
    "the probability of that is negligible , about 10@xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , gravitational bending of the light from the quasar by the intervening galaxy would generally increase the impact parameter and decrease any obscuration ( bartelmann & loeb , 1996 ) .",
    "another possible source of obscuration at high redshifts is thomson scattering by an ionized intergalactic medium , which affects all frequencies @xmath26 equally .",
    "however , even if all the baryons in the universe were distributed in an ionized intergalactic plasma with @xmath27 at the improbably high value of 0.5 , the effect on the results shown in fig . 1 would still be small .",
    "the possibility that some sources have been _ completely _ missed ( also in the radio ) due to both optical obscuration and radio free - free absorption in intervening objects is highly implausible , because a large free - free optical depth would imply a small size for any reasonable excitation parameter , hence a very small probability of a line - of - sight coincidence .",
    "5 .   obscuration by large amounts of dust and/or ionized gas _ intrinsic _ to the quasar is conceivable - it could result in only a faint red galaxy being observed ( although at @xmath7 it would likely be below our detection limit ) , or nothing at all ( even in the radio ) .",
    "however , this possibility does not affect the conclusions drawn here . we are concerned with a particular observed phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _ quasars similar to those seen at @xmath28 , and the space density of such objects decreases at high redshifts .",
    "there must obviously be precursors at still higher redshifts , at least in the form of mass concentrations , but that is a different issue .",
    "furthermore , even if there are `` hidden '' quasars enshrouded in dust and/or ionized gas , if quasars are short - lived objects we would expect such hidden quasars to exist at _ all _ redshifts , so the redshift turnover would be unaffected ( _ eg . _ webster _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) find that the incidence of `` red quasars '' is not redshift - dependent ) .    for all of these reasons",
    ", it is concluded that the observed turnover in the space density of flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars is real , and not due to obscuration .",
    "the actual number of high redshift quasars must be very low : we expect that the number of flat - spectrum quasars at @xmath7 , even down to @xmath29 mjy , is less than 30 over the whole sky .",
    "as we now have complete identifications for our radio sources , once we have redshifts we can map out the entire `` quasar epoch '' using just one complete sample with no optical magnitude limit , selection effects , or complications due to dust obscuration .",
    "we selected a sub - sample of 442 stellar identifications ( quasars and bl lacs ) with @xmath30 jy in the range @xmath31 .",
    "spectroscopic information was already available for two - thirds of these sources , and it was only necessary to obtain spectra of the others .",
    "this has recently been completed , using the eso 3.6 m telescope .",
    "+ of these 442 sources , 91% are quasars and the rest bl lacs .",
    "detailed luminosity functions will be published in a later paper ; here we concentrate on the redshift distribution of the most luminous quasars , those with @xmath32 10@xmath33 w hz@xmath16 sr@xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath34 jy at @xmath12 .",
    "these are indicated by the large filled circles in fig . 1 , and",
    "confirm the conclusion drawn above that there is a real decrease in the space density at high redshifts .",
    "+ a striking feature of fig .",
    "1 is that the optically - selected samples show the same turnover as these luminous radio - selected quasars . as the radio sample",
    "is unaffected by dust obscuration , this strongly suggests that the turnover in the optical samples is also due to a decline in the true space density rather than to dust obscuration as had been proposed earlier ( ostriker & heisler , 1984 ) .",
    "other arguments for the universality of the redshift turnover can be made :    1 .",
    "we implicitly assume that the true ratio of radio - loud to radio - quiet quasars remains constant with redshift .",
    "this is the simplest assumption , which should therefore be preferred in the absence of any compelling counter - arguments , theoretical or observational .",
    "the only relevant observational evidence supports this hypothesis : the fraction of optically - selected quasars which are flat - spectrum radio sources appears to be roughly constant with redshift at @xmath35 ( hooper _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 ) 2 .",
    "if the turnover in optically - selected samples were due to obscuration , radio quasars would be similarly affected .",
    "thus , if the apparent space density were down by a factor of , say , ten at @xmath36 due to obscuration , there would be only a 10% chance of our having found pks 1251 - 407 rather than a blank field .",
    "3 .   the ultraviolet background radiation field may have a similar dependence on redshift , as would be expected if it is produced largely by the quasars ; it increases by two orders of magnitude from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , and may decrease again at still higher redshifts ( bechtold ( 1995 ) and references therein ) , although this remains uncertain .",
    "recent studies ( fall & pei , 1993 ; pei & fall , 1995 ) which consider the possible effects of dust in intervening galaxies and hi clouds suggest that the obscuration due to these objects would not suffice to produce the redshift turnover .",
    "the exact amount of dust in such objects is a matter of debate ( _ eg .",
    "_ prochaska & wolfe , 1996 ; lu _",
    "et al . _ , 1997 ; pettini _ el . _ , 1997 ) ,",
    "but in any case it is not thought to be very large .",
    "the results presented in fig . 1 set limits on the _ total _ intervening dust obscuration along the line of sight - - intergalactic as well as that from intervening galaxies and damped ly@xmath2 absorbers . again making the simplest assumption , namely that the radio fraction of quasars remains constant at the highest redshifts ,",
    "the close agreement in the space density turnover for the radio and optical samples indicates that the effect of obscuration by intervening dust is small .",
    "+    is the quasar epoch coextensive with the epoch of star formation ?",
    "2 shows the evolution of the space density of quasars compared with that of the star formation rate as deduced from recent deep ground- and space - based observations of faint galaxies .",
    "they are remarkably similar . however , the star formation rates have to be corrected for the possible effects of dust within the galaxies .",
    "the corrections can be severe especially at high redshifts , because the relevant observations are made in the rest - frame ultraviolet .",
    "thus the redshift of the peak , and the decline to higher redshifts , are not yet well determined .",
    "infrared and submillimeter observations will ultimately be required to settle these issues .",
    "nevertheless , first indications are that the quasar epoch may indeed also be that of star formation .",
    "a small fraction of the sources in our sample are so - called `` red quasars '' . these objects , discovered by rieke _",
    "et al . _ ( 1979 ) , have an extremely red nucleus - either an infrared excess due to synchrotron emission or an optical deficiency due to instrinsic dust absorption .",
    "they may appear as faint galaxies in the optical , and as quasars in the near - infrared .",
    "the fraction of such objects in our total sample of 878 sources is probably less than about 10% . as noted above",
    ", these do not affect our conclusions concerning the redshift turnover .",
    "+ selecting the reddest of our stellar identifications , we find that about one - quarter are bl lacs , compared to 9% with no colour selection , supporting the synchrotron interpretation for many of the red objects , as originally proposed by rieke _",
    "_ ( 1979 ) . however , the discovery of molecular line emission from a sample of red quasars by carilli _",
    "( 1998 ) indicates the likely presence of dust in some cases , possibly concentrated in dense nuclear tori .",
